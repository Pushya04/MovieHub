The Beach WILL NOT DIE TODAY,"The Beach is interesting in that some people feel that its terrible while there are others who feel that it is an unsung hero of a movie. When I first saw The Beach, back in 2000, I thought it was OK, not as bad as most people said it was. But, just like with A Life Less Ordinary, The Beach grew on me and I had to watch it again. After seeing it a few more times I really started to pick up on what was going on and realized that at the end of the film the viewer has gone through quite an adventure with Dicaprio and co. The acting, cinematography, music, and story are great and hold up after repeat viewings. The Beach is one of those movies that I watch once a year as its enjoyability never decreases. This is a very solid film that will no doubt only increase in its popularity as time goes by as fans of The Beach are quite hardcore. Even though Dany Boyle has said that he is not very proud of The Beach I believe that he's made a gross error and misjudged his work because even after all these years The Beach still has a freshness to it that most films lose while they are still in the theaters. Because of these reasons The Beach will not die today.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Why did it get such bad reviews here?,"This is one of the few times that I have been badly mislead by the reviews on IMDb! I avoided this film in the past because of this, but thought it would be a good ""soft"" film to watch on video with with a friend and his wife (she doesn't like difficult films).What a revelation! I understand that people who have read the book may be disappointed, but as an uneducated viewer this is a fantastic film! Novel situation, novel location (beautiful images, even though the beach was re-modeled), novel plot, novel characters (all of whom are wildly different yet possible to sympathise with - except maybe for Bugs)... this film has everything in it that I find so desperately lacking in the average Hollywood pulp I'm forced to watch with friends.And I *liked* the fact that the film made a few surprising changes in style... I hate knowing the end of a story at least an hour before it finally grinds its inevitable way there (see any ""action"" film).",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Too High a Score?,"I thought it would be right to give The Beach an 8. It's dreamlike scenes on islands really got to me. You really felt like you were a traveler. It was also awesome how an eerie secret comes about, regarding a secret island. It adds a lot of intrigue and suspense. The scenarios that take place on the island are also well done, but I think it was the beginning that really is really appealing. Him discovering the island and getting situated.Well worth the watch. Great vacation flick with cool suspense.8 Stars",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Looks good but is a little hollow when it comes down to it,"American back packer Richard is one of millions of travellers all looking for an unique experience.  When in Bangkok he meets the slightly deranged Daffy who leaves him with stories and a map to a beach on a remote island that can't be seen from the sea.  Taking with him 2 French travellers, Richard sets out to reach the island and finds it inhabited by a mix of people living as a small ideallic community.  However internal conflicts rise up with their arrival and a copy of the map that he gave to some friends threaten to expose the paradise community for it's darker roots.While I know that the critics were a little hard on this film when it came out, my main reason for not going to see it was a feeling of total apathy towards it.  I wasn't interested in the story, have never read the book and didn't feel I had to see it because of either the big name star or the famous British team behind it.  On television (for free) though, is a different matter and I gave it a go.  Firstly the film does look great; I know there are tales of environmental damage to the area but it does look like paradise and is very lush.  Director Boyle's direction is visually good too  whether it be drawing style from scenes or contrasting the city with the island or doing imaginative things like computer game style images, he does work well.The plot is good on paper but isn't as well brought through.  Richard's journey and initial settling into the island is involving and interesting but the main plot is really in the second half which is also where it becomes a weaker film. The film clearly is building into a teenage Hearts of Darkness type story where the DIY civilisation leads to cruelty and madness  this aim can be seen in an early scene where tourists sit watching Apocalypse Now in a waiting area.  However his descent into madness is less well done and less convincing than Brando's.  It all happens to quickly and, although with brutal consequences, it really needed to be seen to be more of a gradual distancing from the norm rather than a sudden leap into an abyss.DiCaprio is not an actor that I particularly like or enjoy to watch but he is pretty good here.  The fact that this film did as well as it did (in terms of box office) is probably mostly down to his star power, but he also gives a good performance.  His madness is well portrayed and it's not his fault the film requires him to suddenly switch the way he does.  Swinton is better as Sal, her `madness' is more subtle and is continual rather than sudden.  The mix of multinational unknowns in the support roles are all good  even if, with so many good looking young people, it does feel a little like a music video shoot at times.Overall I enjoyed the film even if it never got as involving as I hoped it would.  The story lacks punch and point  a fact that can be seen in a very weak ending which was a real wash out in my opinion  but it is still good enough to watch once.  The whole thing looks great and DiCaprio's star power and charisma helps keep the audience with him, it's just that the actual story doesn't quite have the rich feeling or depth that the tourist-film location does.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Pretty good, despite all the bad reviews I've read","I went to this one, knowing that it could be crap, but hey, I do not care what others think and once again this way of thinking did not prove me wrong.This flick is basically about a young twenty who goes away on a trip to Thailand by himself, because he wants to forget his past. There he meets a loony (Robert Carlyle) who gives him a map to a secret paradise. He asks two strangers, Françoise (Virginie Ledoyen who was really great in her first big American Film and good looking too by the way) and Etienne (Guillaume Canet) to come and join them.After they have found the island they meet an alternative group who lives there and they join them, but after a while problems evolve and a minor 'hell' breaks loose.This is the plain story-line of the movie, but there is so much more to it, it has a message and that really is what fascinated me a lot in the beginning and at the end. There was a good story there, but the way it was brought over, never really losing the actual message out of sight. Now believe me the direction, the soundtrack and the cast are good. There also is a bit gore, but it fits good in the movie and is not unnecessary.Yet this film is not flawless, it was good entertainment over all, yes and it was very good in the beginning and in the end, but in the middle when Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio) loses it, so does the film and that is a shame. It is just too weird, too long and too incomprehensible (in the sense that the viewer himself doesn't know if it is real or not). It could have been so much better, but I guess it had to be.NO MUST SEE BUT DEFINATELY WORTH A TRIP TO THE VIDEOSTORE OR TO THE CINEMA AT A DISCOUNT!!!!!!!!7 out of 10P.S.

Lost,"Paradise - the search of it. Where are we at home? Could we live anywhere? Could we do without all the technical gadgets? I'm not saying living alone (though for some that may be the way to do and live it), but living without certain things that make life ""easier"" ... or at least that is how we perceive it.Nature can be quite the enticing thing. And it is in this movie too. The Beach that lends the movie the title is quite the sight. And for a vacation spot ... I mean you could do far worse. Now there had been rumors that the filming was done on a beach or in a place that was supposed to not be touched by western civilization ... I remember Leonardo DiCaprio getting quite a lot of heat because some activists were not happy with him.I can't confirm if they actually loitered or ruined nature in one way or another. If that really interests you, you surely will know a way to find out. I just thought I give an insentive to those who are interested in behind the scenes thing - real or not. Then there is also those who may take offense in the portrayal of certain animals (feeding into our fears and portraying them way more evil than they actually are - talking sharks here).The movie itself is quite the decent thriller. Because the Paradise is not all fun and games. It is also filled with cliches and quite the predictable plot. Still the movie knows to hold up its tension and has quite a few gruesome moments too (graphic violence that is). Not a bad movie then, but not a masterpiece either in my book (while I came to finally admire Leo, his character here is not as relatable - choices and such. There's a general detachment from it all)",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Do not miss this movie just because of its low rating,"Recently a friend of mine watched ""The Beach"" after I told him my favorite quote (i.e. ""Never refuse an invitation, never resist the unfamiliar, never cease to be polite, and never outstay your welcome""). He enjoyed the movie a whole lot and told me he hadn't watched it before because of it's low IMDb rating. That's when I decided to register here and post a comment - I hope I help someone else to watch the movie because it is worth a watch. What I personally like so much about this movie is that it is not just plain vanilla. It actually makes sense and can be a starting point for new thoughts and ideas - something I truly appreciate in a movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Promising start, let down as it progresses","I enjoyed the first half, even two thirds of this movie. It seems to set up an interesting reflection on the fallacy of 'splendid isolation' and 'ignorance is bliss' ways of approaching the unpleasant things about the world as represented by the grimy, noisy nightlife of Bangkok.However, it never quite delivers on this and with the final act fails to stick the landing in terms of hammering home the (what seemed to be) point that burying your head in the sand (no pun intended) is not sustainable and indulging in selfishness/hedonism will always ultimately hurt other people. There are also some weird non-sequiturs with some very dated graphics that really age the movie, although I appreciate they were trying to draw parallels between the pitfalls of becoming lost in virtual worlds and the paradise of the eponymous beach.Most of the performances are fine, although Di Caprio's screaming can get a little annoying at times. Another issue is the fact that, despite being set in Thailand, the only Thai characters we see are presented as violent thugs or stereotypically happy tourist workers - I don't know if that was sort of the point; that only wealthy, (mostly) white westerners were the ones luxuriating in the 'paradise' of the beach, but it feels more like an oversight. Overall it's fine, but no need to go out of your way to watch this one.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Unfairly Panned; A Good Movie,"Here is another of those films that got panned by critics all over the place, but I liked the movie and thought it was unfairly criticized.Two things are not up for debate: the film is entertaining and the cinematography is gorgeous.Leonardo DiCaprio's lead character is not particularly likable, but that's nothing new for him. He's good at playing the boyish, cocky immature type. He's also good at narration, which he provides here, as he has in a number of other films. In fact, I wish there were more of it in here.French actress Virginie Ledoyen is a new face to me, and a pretty one. I found her intriguing, and not just because of her face Actually, all the characters were pretty darn interesting in this film and you get a varied group.The scenery from Thailand is magnificent. By the way, ""the beach"" that's in this film really exists, just as it's seen here. The story is interesting, too, for the full two hours. My only complaint was that they might have toned down the language, particularly with all the f-words.Don't listen to those national critics who blasted this.

Read the Book,Well - Where do I start... A classic story written by Alex Garland - Destroyed by Danny Boyle & co. It would take a long time to pick my way through the debris of this particular shambles so I shall narrow it down to what I see as the main critical flaws that sank Leo's latest water borne epic 1. The movie has been aimed squarely at a teen market hence you get style over content - The beautiful people in paradise hanging out with a highly commercial soundtrack and a Top Shop tie in on the fashion side2. The removal of the deep cynicism evident in Garlands novel - Read the book  - you will find it very hard to find a sympathetic character.3. Richards(Leo) fascination with the whole 'Nam pop culture - this is throw in as an afterthought in the last 25 minutes of the film(apart from a fleeting glimpse of Apocalypse Now in the opening reel)and falls completely flat - what we get is comical( check out Leo as he does his best Cat. Willard impressions - hilarious!4. The love interest. Okay - this I can understand purely for its commercial reasons - it has a bums on seats factor. But it damages a vital part of the book - Richard never gets it together with Francois let alone Sal hence there is an unspoken tension in the air which adds to Richards isolation and his descent into 'Nam paranoia. Enough! If you want the real experience read the book - if you want a very cheap facsimile go see Leo and the gang...3/10,1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Intense and interesting, but contains it's share of flaws.","On a rating scale of 0 to 100; I gave The Beach a score of 72.Many people have stopped themselves from seeing The Beach because of bad reviews from critics and the story of the crew wrecking an entire island to make the movie. One of those things, in my book, is a fact. They did wreck an island, and for pure entertainment, it's not worth it. Still, the bad reviews from the critics I disagree with, I found this quite a little gem, and if you agree with some of my other reviews, I recommend you don't hesitate when you see The Beach sitting on the drama shelf of your video store.The wonders of modern technology, like computers, video games, cell phones, pagers and the internet, were designed to make our lives more enjoyable and facilitate communications. Yet for many, the complexity of the digital world is overwhelming, leading to a feeling of unrealityof being discconected. The desire to find something real  to connect with something or someone  is what drives Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio), a young American backpacker who arrives in Thailand with adventure on his mind. Travel, he asserts, is the search for experience, the quest for something different. Richard and two friends (Virginie Ledoyen and Guillaume Canet) he meets in Thailand risk their lives travelling secret that is dubbed the beach resort for those who don't like beach resorts. At their destination, Richard and friends are welcomed into a community that lives on the beach. However, they soon discover that beneath this surface, this heaven on earth is less than perfect.Leonardo DiCaprio declared he was not anti-Titanic when he did this film. And he isn't. DiCaprio shows on his face how successful he is when he did the film, and he is a show-off. But, darn it all, DiCaprio is good because we know he has the potential. He went a long length to do this movie, even director's favourite Ewan McGregor was passed over for DiCaprio, and rightfully so. I just can't picture anyone else playing the role. The acting hotline is also boiling with such talents as Tilda Swinton, Virginie Ledoyen and the masterful Robert Carlyle. Danny Boyle's direction is solid and he paces the film nicely, and the script is adapted well from Alex Garland's better-than-movie book. The film certainly has flaws, some scenes  particularly the ones with the dope growers  are just plain stupid and the film really loses it's feet towards the end, going completely out of control.Still, The Beach is a film that is ripe for discussion. It features alluring scenery from the small island of Phuket, it has some striking visuals and an absorbing and intense message about finding your own paradise. It's not the best film of 2000, but The Beach remains a worthy attempt.",,Anonymous,Romance

Y2K Lord of the Flies,"A beautiful movie w/ cult potential. Has a major Lord of the Flies feeling. Their idea of paradise could only exist in denial. It wasn't a place exempt from tragedy, they just chose to look away. (Also, young Leo is much appreciated eye candy)",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Beautifil Looking Update of Heart of Darkness/Lord of the Flies,"""The Beach"" is ""Lord of the Flies"" about 20somethings who have seen ""Apocalypse Now"" (it's referred to visually and aurally) but don't seem to have read ""Heart of Darkness"" which inspired it, and which this is basically with a bit of sex and/or desire added (I didn't read the book but the reviews say that wasn't in the Garland book either.)""Deer Hunter"" is also brought to mind with its view of Asian cities and exotic risks; ""Return to Paradise"" takes the same milieu for a much higher moral purpose.I did like the irony of using Leo in one of the sex scenes as just a straight business service deal. The camera also loves Leo and Boyle ramps up the story line with visuals almost as dazzling as in his ""Trainspotting,"" particularly with the frequent references and visualizations of video games.Leo here reminds me of how Jane Fonda would be used in her movies, as the naive American or outsider who gradually learns a lesson in sophistication that the rest of the jaded world already knows. The descent is a bit too swift and not 100% believable.Tilda Swinton is terrific as the leader, though I guess her stupid lug of a boyfriend is just good in bed. Robert Carlyle is briefly in it but is quite memorable and as usual incomprehensible. That man should just walk around with subtitles.The cinematography is gorgeous, but I think it would be hard to ruin the scenery.The soundtrack is lovely and surprisingly too is the electronica.(2/11/2000)",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Didn't Know What to Expect; It Wasn't This... And That's Okay,"For some reason I thought ""The Beach"" was about nuclear disasters or something... not sure why. In reality, the film is about an island where a group of people live away from the world (to an extent, though they hypocritically rely on civilization for supplies)... for some unknown reason undiscovered by mainlanders or airplanes, though they are only a few miles from other people.While the film had some flaws, overall it was really good, I guess. Leonardo DiCaprio is a decent actor, under-rated by many people, I think. His ""survival mode"" where he learns to become one with nature was really cool and reminded me of ""First Blood"", only with a better-looking actor.The infamous video game sequence was not exactly what I expected, and was actually far more cheesy than I assumed. But funny, really funny. Whoever had the idea to put this in the film really had a stroke of genius that day.The makeup and special effects department deserved an Oscar for their work. I have seen plenty of horror films and love ""Jaws""... but the shark attack wounds in this film were so believable I could hardly breathe. Amazing work.All the scenes with Daffy were great. Somewhat gritty and very morbid, I was sucked into this film after the first gruesome scene with him. Excellent visuals. And when we return to this scene a few more times later, it is absolutely excellent. Unlike ""Catch-22"", these returns to the same scene really drive the point home of Leo's state of mind.The beach scenes were also excellent as far as getting across the point of this being a place that was pure, clean and untouched by man. White sands, clear water... don't know if this was special effects or just a great location, but well played.My only two complaints are concerning the sex scene and the over-acting. I was rather confused by the scene between Richard and Sal... if he has a girlfriend, why is he sleeping with the nastiest woman on the island? I just don't get it. That was a poor idea and I found it hard to believe Richard was that stupid... but maybe he was.Also, the over-acting was atrocious. When they first encounter the beach, everyone gets super-pumped. Um, okay... it's a beach. Yeah, it's a really nice beach, but they've been living on islands covered in beaches. It's not a miracle. And when Richard tells of his shark adventure. everyone thinks it's the greatest thing since rye bread and he even tells it in an epic manner. Yeah, alright, it was pretty exciting, but not that exciting. These people need to lay off the crack pipe.But I liked the movie, and if you like Leo you should like this movie. It's a metaphor for teenagers, I think... how they believe they're independent, but really they're not and in reality they're helpless and stupid.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Better than expected,"I know the movie had decent ratings, but it didn't sound like an enjoyable movie. Well I was wrong, it was pretty good. Leo seems to have more decent movies then not so it's fairly safe to assume if he is in a movie it's worth the watch. Great acting on all parts. Tilda Swinton was great too as she usually is. The plot was interesting but a little predictable. I enjoyed Richard losing his grip on reality a little, it made it more believable. I played with the idea of rating it a 7 but it got more interesting even though it took a minute to get there so I'll stick with 8. Id recommend it to a friend.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great start. Good middle. Terrible end.,"Richard's character development just didn't make any sense.

"If you travel, you'll understand","When you travel, you are surrounded by people. Amidst all that foreign intrigue, you are truly alone - an opportunity to be truthful to your instincts.When you are young and you travel, recklessness and the need to experience drive almost all your decision, well other than budgetary constraints.It is therefore quite truthful at times to relate to the character who is in search of this ultimate freedom, a place where all your worldly obligations are suspended and irrelevant.The movie is an irony. Not only externally, that though it depicts the end purity of nature when fox's being sued for environmental damage, but also that any man-found paradise is not free, but with a price and in this case, could be the ultimate price.I truly enjoyed the movie especially at times the sparks of life's insight and moments of traveller's consciousness that when you are there, in that destination, IT becomes reality and no longer are you foreign and problems arise regardless.Though the romance is distracting, Etienne, Canet's portrayal is quite the eye candy.Definitely a watch, but may not appeal to all tastes.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Interesting concept,"I think this movie had an interesting concept and story. It was unpredictable and exciting most of the time. The movie left me with some weird and scary feelings, but I liked that. But I also think there were some flaws with the movie itself, for example the characters' lines and reactions. They sometimes felt unnatural and not fitting, but it was not too much of it. Overall, the movie was good and gave me a nice experience. Recommending!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Mediocre but enjoyable,"The Beach is an anti-tourism movie seen through the eyes of a tourist.Both the film and the book follow the experiences of Richard, a young traveler looking to explore something outside the beaten roads most tourists follow. He catches wind of a secret, idyllic, untouched beach from ""Daffy Duck"" who kills himself shortly after. Richard then goes on to find this mystical beach but finds that paradise isn't all that it seems to be.Some differences remain between the film and the book. Director Danny Boyle takes some artistic liberties that make the plot a bit different than Alex Garland's book. With this, Boyle is still able to build on Garland's initial points laid out in the book. Most changes are believable and the film can be enjoyed as a standalone. The artistic liberties Boyle takes also help drive the plot a bit faster than the book.The casting of young Leonardo DiCaprio is genius as he seems to encapsulate the character of Richard well. The world-building of a dirty, rotten tourist hell that Richard wants to avoid is also well created. Audiences can see why residents at the beach want to keep it hidden from the outside world. Watching this movie also captures the ""tourist vs traveler"" mindsets perfectly well.Outside all the positives that this film has to offer, this film has some flaws. Namely, the film itself isn't that exciting. It seems to miss the ""awe"" moment that Richard feels when he comes to the island. It also seems to force some plot points for the sake of moving the story. Some events seem forced and not believable.Though there were some scenic moments, the film seems to be a collection of events from the book rather than a cohesive collection. And I find that this film's biggest flaw.But I wouldn't blame this on Boyle's directing or DiCaprio's acting. Sometimes it's hard to create a book-to-film adaptation.3/5.

"Now get some sleep, I may wish to have sex again before we eat breakfast.","Danny Boyle (Shallow Grave, Trainspotting, 28 Days Later) brings Leonardo DiCaprio back after Titanic in a story that will make his fans cheer, but leave the rest of us feeling that we were cheated.Long on philosophy, but very short on excitement, this is a movie about Camelot. You remember, don't you, ""...there's simply not a more congenial spot for happily-ever-aftering than here in Camelot."" Or, on the beach, for that matter.Except there is a price to pay for even this, the most idyllic of spots. Even here, the nastiness of death and dying must not intrude. It's how we manage to avoid the ugliness of hundreds of thousands of dead in Iraq, and our reputation sullied by those who condone torture. We mustn't let anything interfere with our pursuit of big screen TVs our gas-guzzling SUVs.With her beautiful face, Virginie Ledoyen (The Valet, 8 Women) was the bright spot in this movie.

"Backpacking in Thailand, oh yeah! :))","When I was travelling in Thailand, everyone was talking about the ""Beach"" and all backpackers aimed for its filming location, Koh Phi Phi. Although I watched a lot of good movies in the touristic cafes on Khao San Road in Bangkok and in Penang, Malaysia, I missed the ""Beach"" and came home wondering what it was all about. I finally saw it yesterday and in spite of a couple of flaws, I genuinely enjoyed it! First of all, it really shows the atmosphere of Thailand - the golden Buddha, the tiny rooms with thin partitions in the guesthouses, the markets, the internet cafes, the tourists' clothes and their very behavior... Second, the landscape is amazing, Leonardo is quite good, although he's had better movies in his career, but he's definitely very convincing in this role, and the girl playing Francois is quite charming. Also, the movie is funny! Third, this movie has a great moral message. Following the tradition of ""Lord of the Flies"" and others, it shows the dangers of separated communities, the disappearance of rules, regrets, the little value human life has in extreme situations, the dangers of a despotic ruler. It shows that the longed-for paradise might not actually be that easy to live in.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Just dive headlong into this beautiful blue lagoon of a movie...,"The late '90s and early 2000s was a time of modern exploration. Everyone was travelling. It was suddenly more accessible to the everyday person; whether it was Disney World, a Greek island or Thailand, the world was on your doorstep.Alex Garland's novel, 'The Beach', perfectly summed up a whole era - nay, a generation - of modern travellers. People who sought out the unknown and the unexplored... but who usually ended up finding mediocrity rather than majesty.Danny Boyle's film adaptation is both true to the source material and free-flowing with poetic licence. He dropped central characters who would, on screen at least, slow things down. He kept the complex dynamics of Richard's narrative and his challenging relationships with other characters like Daffy, Françoise, Sal and Bugs. He also perfectly captured the dark, commercial side of travel in the new millennium, and juxtaposed that with the idillic sense of 'paradise found'.The result? A truly remarkable film that delves deep into the psyche of travellers in a new millennium. The film is tense, gripping and a real study in human behaviour, showing just how selfish people can be if the price is right.Technically, it is beautifully shot and superbly cast (yes, there's the whole DiCaprio / McGregor bust up that Boyle had to handle, but frankly in my opinion, Ewan McGregor would not have done the job DiCaprio did on the character of Richard). As for the supporting cast, Robert Carlyle was probably the only choice for the mentally unstable yet likeable Daffy; and Tilda Swinton's portrayal of matriarch, Sal, is unforgettable. On top of all that, the film is also brilliantly scored, adding even more depth to this rich, enticing lagoon of a movie.'The Beach' has been, in my opinion, unfairly criticised over the last 20-odd years. While I won't say it's the greatest film of all time, I will say it connected with me and, for that reason, it will always sit firmly in my top ten favourite films.For context, I saw this at the cinema at the age of 15. Before then, seeing the world had never really appealed to me. I had no sense of discovery; no burning desire to go places that many others haven't been. This film stirred something within me, awakening a desire to venture to new places, near and far.I also connected with the idea of preserving paradise. Essentially finding your own utopia and putting a proverbial bouncer on the door to keep the world out. We have all felt that way in our lives. Whether on holiday or just in a moment with the right person, we have all wanted to shut the world out and start anew.So this film is for the explorers and the dreamers. Yes, there are holes and frustrations. But the whole point is for the story to be allegorical of humanity. And to err is human. So watch it. Ignore the critics and make your own mind up. It's two hours of your life which, I think, will be very well spent.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

An unpleasant and frustrating experience,"Danny Boyle's The Beach was an awful viewing experience for me and thinking back on it is just as unpleasant, so naturally I don't want to spend a lot of time talking about it.The reason that The Beach is so awful is because it is so pretentious and full of itself. It gives a painfully obvious and blatant expression on a social commentary that feels so forced.The Beach is also extremely boring. I was patiently waiting for the movie to pick up, but after an hour of pure nothing, I gave up hope and assumed that the rest of the film would be just as uneventful. Sadly, I was right.The Beach feels like a 2-hour long Expedia commercial. The music is cheap and terribly cheesy and the cinematography is sometimes interesting, but mostly just dull.Leonardo DiCaprio did give an entertaining performance even though he did overact quite a bit. Tilda Swinton wasn't bad either, but the rest of the cast is just so forgettable and boring that it even weighs down these two characters. Robert Carlyle was one of the few redeemable aspects of The Beach. His character was utterly mad and it seemed that he loved playing this character, which made him a blast to watch.The story is painfully slow. We have to endure long stretches of Leo's character expressing his obsession for a girl he barely knows, then we are suddenly treated to a horrifically graphic shark attack scene. The tone of The Beach is never established. Most of the movie is extremely depressing and generally uncomfortable to watch, but then the movie ends on a gleefully happy note as if nothing bad even happened.The best way I can explain The Beach is that it is a confused, hyper mess of a film that tackles a social commentary so blatantly obvious that it comes off grossly pretentious. And any time Danny Boyle tries to have fun, it comes off as just awkward.While The Beach does have a passionate cult following, I simply cannot find enjoyment in the film myself. It's dull, pretentious and just messy. I respect Danny Boyle as a film maker but I really don't know what he was hoping to achieve with this one. I'm just grateful that the whole experience was completely forgettable. Another trip to this mind- numbing ""paradise"" wouldn't be good for my sanity.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
not very gritty story of survival,"Is this merely `Survivor' without the million-dollar payoff?  Or is it a modern vision of James Hilton's most famous novel?  For those too young to have any memories of `Lost Horizon,' `The Beach' may seem like a wildly new and original work.  And, as this is, essentially, a narcissistic youth fantasy starring teen-idol Leonardo Di Caprio, chances are that most of the film's audience will indeed be hovering somewhere near the puberty mark. Since the cast of characters is so youthful to begin with, the film is able to dispense with  or, at the most, treat obliquely  one of the major themes that runs through `Lost Horizon,' that of the universal lure of Eternal Youth.Di Caprio stars as Richard, a young man so bored with the mundane rituals of modern civilized life that he journeys alone to Bangkok to partake of the exotic experiences a more primitive life has to offer.  While there, he encounters a seeming madman who, right before his suicide, draws a map for Richard revealing the whereabouts of a small tropical island, guaranteed to be a Shangri-la for any person clever and daring enough to get there. Recruiting two of his hotel neighbors  a young French couple  to accompany him, Richard sets out to find his own private place in the sun.  But life is never quite that simple and the three soon discover that the island is already inhabited by other jaded tourists who have set up a carefree, thriving community far away from both the amenities and problems of the modern world.This concept of discovering a secret, pristine and uncorrupted paradise has a timeless appeal and pull.  And, as long as `The Beach' hews closely to this theme, it remains a reasonably interesting film, for who cannot identify at least partially with the lure of this idea?  The tricky part for the filmmakers tackling this theme is to make this unlikely situation seem real and believable.   Unfortunately, in the case of `The Beach,' the people who comprise this out-of-the-way community seem, for the most part, way too agreeable and cooperative.  This is like a Club Med resort without the room service.  Survival here doesn't seem like much of a struggle and there rarely ever seems to be much in the way of intense disagreements and arguments amongst the group's members.  We wonder, for instance, why, without monetary compensation or incentives of any kind for that matter, one man does all the cooking while another man does all the building.  As far as we can tell, they do virtually all the work on the island while the others frolic on the beach playing volleyball all day.  `Lost Horizon' was a certified fantasy  `The Beach' aspires to realism yet it needs a bit more grit to really achieve the truth it is after.  Yes, grim reality does occasionally poke its ugly head into this insulated world from time to time in the form of man-eating sharks and gun-toting pot harvesters - but the characters themselves lack psychological depth and clarity.  With rare exceptions, the people on the island seem to exist in a state of unlikely harmony, exhibiting little or none of the human conflict, personal jealousy or power politics one would reasonably expect to find in such a situation. Then when, late in the game, the film develops grand illusions of becoming a meaningful and grim look into the dark heart of madness, `The Beach' becomes both pretentious and laughable.   This is particularly the case because Richard seems to drift in and out of madness with a dexterity that would leave Sigmund Freud himself speechless and dumbfounded.`The Beach' may well appeal to all those viewers who found the phony, pseudo-adventure theatrics of `Survivor' realistic and compelling.  Indeed, the best part of the film is the ending when all these pathetic, craven softies from civilization, who fancy themselves rugged individualists, get their final comeuppance.  Those of us who have long ago freely capitulated to the lure of all our assorted modern amenities happily get the last laugh.",,Anonymous,Romance
Hollywood offers beach boys and beach girls looking for the meaning of life,"""The Beach"" has Danny Boyles signature and that is why I trustingly picked up this film at the DVD store to watch it. It was a big disappointment. Danny Boyle directed ""Trainspotting! What happened to him? In ""The Beach"" the characters are portrayed superficially. The story runs like this. Leonardo DiCaprio and two friends with the aid of a map go to an island (located somewhere in Thailand) and there find a beach in which there is community of people who ran away from civilization and are trying to live a new kind of life, without restraint and hypocrisy. The film shows the problems and conflicts of this community and the inner struggle going inside Leonardo DiCaprio(his thoughts and reflections are revealed by a voice in off). But the characters in this film have no depth at all. It is in reality a Hollywood movie. If you compare it with ""L'Auberge Espagnol"" this film really sinks in the sand.""L'Auberge Espagnol"" and ""The Beach"" have some plot similarities. Both portray young people who try to live in a different way. In ""L'Auberge Espagnol"" the characters have a face and a name and we care about them. Now in ""The Beach"" the characters are cardboard people. The deep changes going inside Leonardo DiCaprio remain almost incomprehensible.For those that want some adventure film with exotic locations ""The Beach"" is all right. You'll have your fun. But if you're looking for something more avoid ""The Beach"".",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Life is a 'Beach',"'The Beach' starts off colored by the shallow and self-obsessed millennial angst of Gen X/early Gen Y that was (is?) so rampant at the time, and by the time it's over any interesting observations it makes about human nature or modern society are undermined by the fact that it looks like a J.

An amazing film,"Danny Boyle did an exquisite job on this film. When I first learned that it was indeed a Danny Boyle film I was a bit disappointed that it didn't have any of his ""original"" cast members... the people that he always works with. When I learned that Robert Carlyle was in this, I was ecstatic. This film has so many wonderful points, I can't list them all. I'm just going to say that ""enjoy your dinner Richard"" was a classic cinematic moment. A great thing about this film is that it's a wonderful representation of a microcosm of todays society. It shows that no matter how hard you try to escape all the wrongs in life, and all of your daily annoyances, they'll still be there no matter where you escape to. This film doesn't go from beginning to end. It circles. There is no ending because their lives didn't end. Truly a supreme film. It is what one should expect from a man like Danny Boyle. Leonardo DiCaprio gives another amazing performance. It takes a wonderful actor to be able to portray an emotion such as insanity just with his eyes, and he did so wonderfully!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Good movie with a solid plot and some interesting messages that can still be applied today, after more than 20 years.","At first, the vibes of the film are positive, but then it spirals down into a dark and eerie tone with an amazing twist of events. ""The Beach"" works so well, because what happens is believable, nothing is exaggerated and the acting is very natural; everything fits smoothly, characters change along the runtime and there is a well thought out development in the plot as well. The director exposed a few critics towards conformism: everyone wants to feel unique, except everyone does the same exact things, even when they have the opportunity to do something truly different than the usual stuff. He is also telling us that running away from problems is never the solution, as you might feel good for a while, but then if you do not solve them, they will eventually catch up with you and this is exactly what happens to Richard. Even though the concept is not that original, it is well built from the ground up and most of all, it does not look cheesy. To back up this project there is a competent writing and a robust cast that sees Leonardo DiCaprio as the main protagonist. The photography is beautiful: we get to see some stunning exotic natural spots and there are several underwater shots worth mentioning. This is definitely a good movie that I strongly advise to watch, as unfortunately it never got the attention that it deserved.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very good,"I'll be brief. I didn't want to watch 'The Beach' because of the bad reviews, but when I accidentally came across it while surfing through the channels, I couldn't stop watching.If you're young and have a thing for interesting stories, you'll love this one.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Leonardo DiCaprio's Heart of Darkness,"This is Leonardo DiCaprio's Heart of Darkness in Danny Boyle's intriguing adventure film which sees backpacking student Richard (DiCaprio) going in search of paradise only to be confronted by the power dynamics of a seemingly peace loving commune that has set up it's own society on a remote island. Accepted into the group he soon finds out that things are not what they seem to be on the surface and it becomes a matter of life and death in trying to escape.For me this felt more like a cross between The Blue Lagoon (1980) and Peter Benchley's The Island (1980), with echoes of the aforementioned Joseph Conrad novel. Filmed off the coast of Thailand it is beautifully photographed but Danny Boyle's direction is not as assured as it was in Trainspotting (1996) or Shallow Grave (1994) despite the same director, producer and writing team that brings Alex Garland's cult novel to life. The narrative and characterisations get a little confusing at times and the sexual tension of the novel spills over into sex for the movie and loses the films momentum.Tilda Swinton gives a convincing performance as the jealous leader of the commune who has a slightly unhinged and unpredictable quality and Robert Carlyle has a brief appearance as world weary and deranged traveller Daffy, who points DiCaprio's character in the direction of the island with a sketchily hand drawn map.For the most part The Beach is entertaining, intriguing and nice to look at and not as bad as some reviewers make this out to be but coming off the back of the multi Oscar winning Titanic (1997) fans of DiCaprio probably expected more, this being his first Hollywood film since being elevated to superstardom in James Cameron's epic romance.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Unconvincing, sluggish farce with good scenery","What a dissapointment.  Even after hearing the poor reviews, I was hoping for the best.  What we have here is a movie that has a fantasy island soap opera type story centering around neo flower children and anti establishment hippy types, born to surf and smoke dope, where nobody can find them.  Plot continues with a pretentious romp through the jungles of said ""secret"" island by a few daringly foolish kids.  Character development is weak; the film uses the ploy of introducing characters by very staged and phony scenes, where one by one, the characters mumble a few lines about themselves, sort of reminiscent of Armageddon and Drop Dead Gorgeous, and move on.I never really identified or felt sympathy with most of the characters. I didn't enjoy the films little hat tip to its scenes vaguely similar to Apocalypse Now.The best thing about the movie is the scenery, but even that did not seem to be captured very well, as many scenes seemed dark and blurry or unfocused and poorly lit, I guess in an attempt to develop mood.This movie had great potential, but in retrospect, it just tried to",,Anonymous,Romance
Disappointing screenplay,"Quite a good story but I must say that I am quite disappointed. That's mainly because I have read the book and there were many changes made in the screenplay.I simply could NOT believe they left out Jed's character (a central character from the book) from the movie. Only the first hour of the movie follow closely to the book,  everything strayed away after the first hour. Right up to the end.But as John Hodge (the screenwriter) had mentioned, ""Novels are subtle, screenplays blunt"". As in most adaptations, characters had  to be combined and many MAJOR changes were made (I wished the Richard-Francoise-Etienne triangle didn't turn out like what they did in the movie).All in all, it is a good movie.. but I would strongly suggest to those who have not read the book go see the movie first, then read it.. or else you just might be a WEE BIT disappointed like yours truly.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Not a disaster, but low for Boyle","Many people call The Beach Danny Boyle's weakest and most disappointing films. To those people I say, ""Hey... they can't all be perfect."" The Beach stars Leonardo DiCaprio, infamously snatching the role from Boyle favorite Ewan McGregor causing a dramatic fallout between the two, as Richard, a young guy who, while visiting Thailand, gets his hands on a map that leads to a mysterious island rumored to be a paradise. Richard meets two French tourists in his hotel and asks them to set out with him to find this elusive paradise. From here the film branches out into part romance, part adventure, part psychological thriller. It never really catches its footing and it never steers in a clear direction. It's not a disaster but it isn't an excellent film either.There isn't much about The Beach that is noteworthy or memorable. It isn't terrible in any one department, it's just lacking in all departments. Visually it isn't anything terribly special. This may be because of the high expectations I have from eccentric visual mastermind, Danny Boyle. The Beach lacks his nuanced flare and incredibly unique quality to the style. The music selection for the film is admittedly neat, but the visuals are sub par in comparison.But where The Beach really lacks is its poor script and uninteresting characters. There's nothing very compelling about this story and the characters don't engage your mind and nothing special really happens. The dialogue is often silly and unnatural and there are too many unrealistic changes of character tone. There are amateur mistakes being made here, such as when a character is fine one second but then gets overly angry just so that something irrational will happen in order to move the story along. The Beach doesn't flow naturally and a lot of what happens feels very forced. The acting is nothing special either. Tilda Swinton's role is really the only one worth mentioning, considering DiCaprio isn't much more than a pretty face in this movie. All of these faulty elements to The Beach certainly could have been much worse, but they don't make this film anything special.To see a film of this low calibre from an auteur like Danny Boyle is always shocking, but it's simply what happens. They can't all be winners and The Beach is proof of that. But I can only rejoice in the fact that I can so easily forget about this dull little film by watching 28 Days Later..., 127 Hours, or Slumdog Millionaire instead.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Cult movie potential,"Like the many times referenced ""Apocalypse Now"", this one could really reach the status of cult movie among the nature lovers and hippy heirs. The movie its all the perfect spots during the first half. The beach, the people, the rhythm, the actors, the music... all is stunning. They even sing Bob Marley by the fire. But the film's second half is strange, erratic, scattered, it leaves the awe-inspiring journey sense and centers in a strange and sudden ""mood"" by DiCaprio's Richard. This is where the letdown is fully, although the ending doesn't feel disappointing. As for the cult movie potential, I think the next generations must judge it, but it has a great deal of bitterness to it and if two years later the film isn't a ""word of mouth"" phenomenon, maybe it won't have such a cult afterall. Anyway, I thought it was a great work by the scottish team of ""Trainspotting"", the script is an asset, and I say it again, DiCaprio is not just a pretty face. Recomend it to all people from 18 up. Live it and think about it. I sure liked it anyway...",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Beach,"We are lucky that the photography depicts some of the most beautiful scenery on Earth as the rest of this adaptation of Alex Garland's book is positively stodgy. Talking of beautiful things, Leonardo DiCaprio still has something of his ""Romeo & Juliet"" (1996) boyishness to him as he arrives in Thailand. After an encounter with an enigmatic Scotsman (Robert Carlyle) who doesn't last for long, he finds himself in possession of a map that sets himself and a couple of travelling companions on a quest to find to a beautiful paradise island that is well off the beaten track. After a few tricky experiences that remind them all that it's called a wilderness for a reason, they arrive to find that ""Sal"" (Tilda Swinton) has already set up camp and with what amounts to a naturist commune has strict rules for those who want to remain there. Initially this idyll works for all, but a trip to town for supplies redefines the relationship between ""Richard"" and his host, and his own stupidity leaves a path for others to follow. With tragedy and bloodshed now ensuing, the Elysian concept of their perfect existence is quickly compromised by both nature and the angry locals. To be honest, it's a pretty thin story at the best of times and it really does rely heavily on the pristine aesthetics to carry it for a great deal of it's almost two hour crawl time. Swinton is always a master at the slightly aloof, less is more, kind of characterisations and Leo himself has the camera enthralled. As as piece of storytelling, though, it's really nothing special beyond a wordy and ponderous exercise in sending a salutary message that the ever expansive march of tourism ought to learn to keep of the grass and leave nature in it's many different guises to live in peace.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

You'll have wasted all your money on plane tickets and inoculations and the only thing you'll have to show for it is a small paragraph in the obituary column of the local newspaper after dying from a rare tropical diseaseTHE BEACH is very similar in many ways . It's based on a well regarded novel by Alex Garland , features Leonardo Dicaprio a megastar after his role in TITANIC and is directed by Danny Boyle one of Britain's greatest living directors and yet it's a film that is difficult to enjoy and it's easy to explain why - characterisationTake one American pretty boy , send him in Thailand , stick him on an island with a bunch of selfish , unsympathetic people and watch a potentially good film fall apart .

I haven't read Garland's novel but I'm led to believe there's a scene where a giant squid is washed up on the beach and the characters eat it only to end up with food poisoning . I would have enjoyed this movie much more if all the characters had died from food poisoning . When you watch a movie and the most likable character is a mad mental foul mouthed dope smoking Scotsman then you know the producers have got a problemAnother thing I had problems with is the way Leonardo Dicaprio's character Richard suddenly turns from inquisitive backpacker into Colonel Kurtz . Something similar happens in another Boyle movie 28 DAYS LATER but at least in that movie you're aware of the character's motive even if it is fairly unconvincing . Here you do find yourself wondering the explanation ended up on the cutting room floor or even if it was excluded at draft stage . Not only that but you find that the characters remain unchanged by events at the end therefore there is zero character developmentDanny Boyle has said that he makes quintessential British films and it's difficult to disagree with him . TRAINSPOTTING has a strong feel of time and place while 28 DAYS LATER mirrors the British apocalypse writers of the 1950s .

I can't believe after watching this film that Garland signed away a beautiful, gripping and thought-provoking novel, which operated on so many levels, to this dumbed-down Hollywood trash movie.

And that doesn't mean the film is lacking story, it's got more than enough of that to sustain interest over two hours.I have been surprised to note that many critics have attacked the movie and I can't help but think this is largely because they don't like Leo, perhaps feeling a male hero must surface only in the mold of a Bruce Willis or Harrison Ford.

I don't like Paradise (dvd),"This movie illustrates brilliantly the idea that i came with my spiritual reading: while revealed books speak about paradise as ultimate reward, with gold, women, my concern was about the one I love down there and who could be sentenced to hell! How could i be happy to be in Paradise if they weren't?Here the dilemma may be different but the anguish is the same: Heaven can turn into Hell, and as the movie intelligently points out, where do you go then if you want to leave Paradise?Another good testimony here is the numbness and delusion of modern life: actually, we experience a lot of virtual pleasure (as reading this web screen now) and we have lost touch with what is real! Thus, we have all inside us this yearning for a simpler life, communicating with people that we can actually touch! The global village is just a mirage because our body is attached to one location at one time.At last, the movie offers another great truth about ultimate freedom and doing whatever we want. This isn't paradise because it's indeed the pathway to hell, the right journey to madness!With all those subversive ideas, Boyle delivers a great movie, a modern parable that he explains with his commentary. The Leo we see here is the Leo i don't like: conquering, arrogant, liar, cheater and worse.

"Great scenery, shame about the script","""The Beach"" is blessed with magnificent scenery and outstanding cinematography, courtesy of Darius Kronji. The cast are all up to the job, including many who are unknown to North American audiences. It is a shame that their talents are wasted on a script which is riddled with so many glaring loopholes:1) The idyllic beach community, which the Leonardo daCaprio character and his two French friends discover, has apparently been in existence on this isolated island for 6 years. So how do they obtain their money for the periodic shopping trips to the Thai mainland for the little luxuries such as deoderants, batteries and Tampaxes which they cannot grow in Paradise?2) The government of Paradise is always a problem. The Tilda Swinton character has apparently been accepted as the leader, but whether this was arranged by group consensus or sheer force of personality is never explained. It is never made clear how the various tiresome chores (housebuilding, gardening, fishing) are allocated and work enforced. As there are no unifying ideals in the community apart from the aimless pursuit of pleasure, it is hard to see how it could hold together for long.3) There is a major problem when one of the fishermen who help support the community is badly injured. He is left to die in horrible agony in the jungle - out of sight, out of mind. The loathsome Swinton character fears that, if he was allowed to go to a mainland hospital, the ""secret"" of the island might leak out. The aimless community beach life carries on regardless. Most of the community raises no serious objection to this act of near-murder. Has no one else fallen sick or been injured in 6 years? Does no one consider what will happen to them if they fall sick?4) The Tilda Swinton character is one of the dumbest, as well as one of the vilest, group leaders ever portrayed on film. She sleeps with the Leonardo character when they go to the Thai mainland for supplies - despite the fact that both have partners back on the island. She seemingly knows nothing about group dynamics and cares nothing about creating divisive jealousy in such a small and isolated community.5) Although the group has apparently existed for 6 years, with cheerfully casual indulgence in sex all round, there are no children in the community. Also, none of the characters seems to have any family outside the island - or none they want to keep in touch with.

Dream like state scarred with ultra realism,"Reading the reviews here has been quite enlightening for me. I've always held this movie in a very high regard. A great story (regardless of whether it's believable or not), well acted cast, good pace and a pitch perfect soundtrack.I first watched this movie in my teen years as a working class Glaswegian who could only dream of travelling to other countries. On the face of it, it taught me that you don't have to be rich to travel. Further, it taught me that travel wasn't just an extended holiday, but rather something that could change your entire perspective on life (for the better or worse).Fast forward to the rewatch in my 30s (having travelled to over 40 countries and all 7 continents). It still holds up. Some of the characters that seemed so cartoonish to me back then became all too real as I jumped from place to place. In fact, the number of young travellers I met who were clearly inspired by this style of travel cements this movie into society more than most people would believe.I've never actually travelled to Thailand. Maybe I don't want to shatter the dream like state this movie created for me. Maybe I've just not got round to it. Who knows. What I do know is that even the so called 'worst scenes - video game for example' had a lot more to do with character development than my younger self would have realised. In fact, I'd argue that the video game scene sped up a process of descent into an escape from reality of the main character far better than a dreary apocalypse now candlelit speech ever could - in terms of pace at the very least. Maybe I should take that last part back. Comparing a Brando performance to a video game motion sequence is probably blasphemous but in terms of pacing and the feel of this particular movie I'm ok with it. I often compare it to the dance sequence in 500 days of summer in regard to how a seemingly 'rooted in reality' movie can swiftly jump into pantomime and back again without an eye brow being raised. Risky filmmaking, but in this case, useful.Overall, there are undoubtedly things I would change but to me the way Danny Boyle created an idyllic dream like movie scarred with ultra realism was perfect in my opinion.Worth rewatching if anyone is stuck at home over the holidays and is dreaming of the outside world.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bad.,"The general premise is good, but the delivery leaves much to be desired. Main characters are shallow and annoying, the lead in particular. Pretty much all of them have unrealistic behavior and motivations for their actions, and the plot loses most of the sense in the second half of the movie.Good parts are the visuals, and the music, so there is some value for late 90s, early 00s nostalgia. But that is pretty much it.Not recommended.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Abysmal,"THE BEACH (2000) *1/2 Leonardo Di Caprio, Virginie Ledoyen, Guillaume Canet, Tilda Swinton, Robert Carlyle. Flaccid adaptation of Alex Garland's novel about a young American abroad in Thailand (Di Caprio) who comes across a map to a desolate island paradise and embarks for the promised land with his befriended French couple where they discover less than idyllic offerings in an all too good to be true hideaway from civilization.Comes across as a hybrid of 'The Blue Lagoon' and 'Lord of The Flies' as envisioned by a group of stoned hippies with a lot of laughable sequences and a surprisingly uninteresting plot (man becoming more uncivilized and the disharmony after madness approaches one's being). Ledoyen is as wooden as a mannequin and there are more than the average stupefying moments in this film in recent memory (her boyfriend does NOTHING when he FINALLY catches on that Leo is giving her the high hard one?!! And then disappears from the film for 20 minutes?!!) (Dir: Danny Boyle)",,Anonymous,Romance
This movie left me with a feeling of uncertainty,"I really enjoyed this film but I couldn't help but think was Di Caprio really there on official police business or was the whole scenario in his mind. His mental problems were most likely due to his marijuana problem and his hatred of the French.Ben Kingsley on the other hand was superb as that stoned lesbian mainland rapist. The make-up team and everyone involved with making Kingsley so believable in what can only be described as his greatest role to date deserve as much credit as the man himself.I hope that they fully consider making a sequel as I wonder what will become of Di Caprio after he gets that injection that kills him. The story has another movie in it for sure and I know I'm not the only one that feels this way due to the massive amount of support that my blog ha received in the last few years, which has became almost violent and bordering on revolution.Viva le France baby!",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Pursuit of Pleasure,"I haven't read the novel, and I do not know how this compares to it. This starts the success story that is the partnership of Boyle and Garland. With those directing and writing, respectively, marvelous things happen. This isn't the best(so far, of what I've seen, that's 28 Days Later..., though I haven't watched Sunshine), but it's a nice start. While this never completely grabs you the way it seems like it meant to, it is still an interesting enough piece. Leonardo stars as Richard, a youth who hears about a mythical place and goes to seek it out. The script reveals a degree of naiveté, and there are a couple of obvious holes in the concept. If you do stick with it, this comments convincingly on human nature. Some of the voice-overs are a tad pretentious. This has great editing and cinematography. The acting tends to be pretty solid, and, in order from most to least, Swinton, Carlyle and DiCaprio do impeccable work. Pacing is good. The plot develops throughout, though it doesn't all hold up to close scrutiny. This holds strong language, brief nudity, a bit of sexuality, disturbing content and instances of graphic violence. I recommend this to fans of those involved, and of this type of film. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
(6/10) Pretty pictures - but little substance in this adaptation,"The Beach, Danny Boyle's new film, is a philosophical exploration of the concept of Paradise.  A postmodernist slice of life is served up with splendid cinematography, stunning locations and a cast that tries very hard. But the adaptation of Alex Garland's novel is underdeveloped, not allowing much scope - or script - with which the actors can work.The basic plot follows Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his quest for finding something different.  When a raving lunatic (Robert Carlyle) provides a map to a paradisiacal island, Richard sets off to find the place, with two French tourists (Virginie Ledoyen and Guillaume Canet) in tow.  They find the beach, which indeed seems to be a heaven on earth, and are inducted into the multi-national community under the instruction of its matriarch, Sal (Tilda Swinton).  The question is: how long can this paradise last before it is lost?DiCaprio does as much as he can with the rather shallow character of Richard - this actor is developing his skills quite admirably, although none of the anti-DiCaprians would care to admit this.  He layers his performance with a nice dash of cynicism - just enough to balance the idealistic world which is presented to the audience.  Swinton is impressive as Sal, in a very Apocalypse Now-type character and neatly captures the conflicting values of what it takes to preserve their paradise.  Ledoyen has little to do but look alluring and Canet, as her husband, is wasted in what could have been developed into a solid subplot.  Carlyle is perfect in his cameo as the man who provides the means for finding the island.Boyle has set a credible standard with Trainspotting and Shallow Grave, but does not provide a similar film ""experience"" with The Beach.  Much of the fault lies with John Hodge's superficial screenplay, which skims over Garland's book and tries to soften the blows which are dealt in that text. Although there are very good sequences within the film, the piece jars as a whole and really drags through the middle of the story.This could have been a great movie, falling short as a result of the lack in balance between story and pictures.  The pictures are nice, but a substantial story is what should be provided as a solid basis for any film - we are after all adult audiences watching a film about grown up issues.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""The Beach"" - An experience",":Trust Me, Its Paradise'The Beach' is a kinda of movie the feel of which surrounds you slowly and completely.I'd say Danny Boyle has done complete justification to the book. The movie captures the essence of the book. I watched the movie first and then read the book. The beach can be better experienced thru the movie. The music (by Angelo Badalamenti) is excellent, but unfortunately not popular( which is why I believe popular is not always the best ;-)). DiCaprio proves how versatile and powerful he is as an actor. A must watch for DiCaprio fans. Purchase an original DVD and you'll get to see alternate beginning and alternate climax of the movie with director's comments. You will like this movie especially if you are a crazy traveler and like to explore unseen and untouched places.Direction, location, music and DiCaprio are the strengths of the movie.

The Communist Beach,"I don't know, but for some reason I remember seeing this movie in the list of movies that would shock with the ending. But it wasn't. Probably i remembered wrong. I also thought the movie was a very old movie. But it was filmed in 2000. The movie was not liked by most people, audience. I understand why. The movie based on the Alex Garland's book. I haven't read the book, but people who have read it thought it wasn't well adapted. The plot of the movie was good. The first half wasn't bad, but then it goes into down. Acting wasn't bad. But I don't think Leonardo di Caprio has done a good acting performance. Although I didn't like the movie in general, there were a few themes that I liked. First of all, I didn't always like Communism. While it sounds good as an idea, I think we've seen how awful it is in practice. Also, people are selfish. Anytime. People also are coward. I think at the beginning of the movie, it starts as ""pack your bags and take a vacation right away."" But real life is not like that. Well, I think the island was a communist metaphor. Although it was good at the beginning, the chaos begins when human-centered issues arise again. I just liked this communist and human centered theme. Dany Boyle is not my favorite director. He has good movies, medium and bad. I think this movie is one of the his worst movies.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

6.7 - Love it but for different reasons,"This film came out when I was very young and not long after I had managed to get my hands on a copy of Titanic which had left quite the impression on me, especially with what happens to Leo's character at the end so I basically had no interest in anything else he was in for a while (in my defence I was a small impressionable child lol) and just forgot all about The Beach until a few years back when it was put on Netflix. I have this thing where I watch very well known films years after everyone else and they end up becoming a favourite - this is the case for me with The Beach. I'm glad I watched it when I did because I don't think I would have resonated with it in the same way if I had watched it sooner.The main reason why I love it because it reminds me of my uncle who used to travel loads - especially to Thailand - he passed away young years ago but I know he was so happy when travelling so it makes me happy when I watch it. The ending scene also reminds me of my own travels in the sense that it evokes a certain feeling that you get when returning back to normality after travelling. Someone uploaded this scene to YouTube years ago and it constantly gets comments from people about their own experiences - it's really nice.The story is a little weird and gets quite scary at times - there are quite a few characters who do very morally wrong things and it's very messed up. I guess it just shows how nothing is perfect and living the way they were, in a place they never should have been was never going to work out/last forever. I also learned after that the production really damaged the area when preparing for filming and that is really not ok. Ironic!I'd love to see a sequel of some sort and have heard there may be a tv show which would be cool, but might have to stick to reading the book it's based on!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Lacking all the elements a movie needs!,"I didn't want to see this movie in the first place; I just went because of two things. One is for my love of movies, and the other is because my girlfriend really wanted to see it. By the end of this movie, we both agreed that it was the crappiest movie we'd seen (at least in theaters) in a long time. THE BEACH lacked all the elements that I look for in a movie and that I think makes a movie important. I was really tempted to sneak out of that stupid movie and go see THE TIGGER STORY!Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio), a young dope-addicted traveler who is trying to forget his past, meets a psycho named Daffy (Robert Carlyle) who gives him a map to a beautiful island/beach paradise before committing suicide. Richard, along with two more dope-addicts, Sal (Tilda Swinton) and Françoise (Virginie Ledoyen), set out to find this beach. What they find is a community living together without the evils of the world, struggling to keep their existence a secret so the rest of the world doesn't spoil it. It turns out Richard is the biggest danger to the secret of the community.Sound like it might have a plot. Think again. This movie is completely plotless. At first, you may think it's a love story between Leonardo and Tilda, but that stop quickly. Then it seems like it is about Leonardo losing his sanity, but that quickly comes to an end as well. Then it seems a may be a fight between the community and another group living on the island, but that's not the case either. You will wait from the start to the end of this movie for the plot to start, but it will never come.Another element this movie lacks, in fact probably the only element that is left for a movie with no plot, is character development. Leonardo's character in the beginning refuses to talk at all about his past. Godforbid we might actually get to know his character. You'll feel just the same about him in the beginning as you do in the end, with no development at all. The rest of the characters are also boring and don't get much better. The acting is nothing special. Leonardo does a fair job, but the horrible script prevents me from calling his performance anything great.Unless you're a dedicated Leonardo fan, skip THE BEACH. I found it very long, boring, pointless and not entertaining.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Exotic Adventures,"For me, when a film fails to engage me by itself, I jump up a level, in this case making it a chapter in the movie of the life of Danny Boyle. I like the guy. I like his instincts. He envisions worlds that resemble reality but which can only exist in cinema, and then he allows the world to emerge in cinematic constructions as if it were its own character.This is an enticing way to invite us into a film, because it comes to us one with the means by which it comes to us. But this film failed, even by his measure. I think one reason is the heavy-handed control the producers asserted. Key elements of the cast, story and art design were beyond his control.But still, you can see some missteps, and they become more obvious when you see how Boyle handled similar challenges in subsequent movies.The exotic here simply does not impress as exotic. He fixed that in 'Slumdog.' There is the dramatic device of encounter with merciless nature as purifying. This is a questionable dynamic for a viewer to accept because accommodating it for living is expensive. Nonetheless, Boyle mastered this in 'Hours.' And then there is the more interesting and powerful notion of the 'inner movie' as it folds into the larger events. In this film, we have the idea of computer games. The writer makes an awkward conflation of desktop computers and hand-held gaming, and also email with gaming. But long before that, there are difficulties. The inner game Richard experiences when in his heart of darkness does not comply with what I will call Ted's law: that the difference between the viewer's comfortable world and the normal world of the film (here the community on the beach) should be the same as the difference between that world and the hallucinated one.Boyle solved this amazingly effectively with his 'Sunshine,' which very much impressed me in this regard. But there is an inner hallucination in 'Hours' that works and the more contrived TeeVee show in 'Slumdog' that works as well. Both adjust to this rule, which seems to be a hard limit on our ability to comprehend narrative.So I see this, not so much as Richard's story, but the story of Danny's disastrous encounter, and what he learned.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",,Anonymous,Romance
"engaging, if ultimately incoherent","mild spoiler possibilities below . . .Like a lot of others who have commented, I initially stayed away from 'The Beach' because of the bad reviews and the nonsensical casting of Leonardo DiCaprio, who seemed then (and now) to be a relatively poor choice to play the lead of Richard (apparently, Danny Boyle originally promised the role to Ewan MacGregor but was persuaded by the money-people to renege the offer and cast Leo, hot off the massive success of 'Titanic'--a slight which damaged their long-standing working relationship and led MacGregor to refuse the lead in Boyle's '28 Days Later,' which ended up going to Cillian Murphy). But I caught 'The Beach' on cable TV, and, while it is ultimately sort of a mess, I was riveted by the direction and the appealing scenario of a small group of neo-hippie travelers trying to form a Utopian community on a hidden Thai beach.What makes the film so engrossing is Boyle's trademark style, combining stunning visuals, a cast of typically striking and attractive actors, and the innovative use of sound-tracking with irresistibly quirky and hip pop music.The scenario: Richard is backpacking alone across Asia, partying in the various idyllic hot-spots with like-minded young people, when he encounters the aptly-named Daffy (Robert Carlyle), who describes to Richard a rumored a perfect, 'hidden beach' off the coast of Thailand where a group of 'beautiful people' live in a perpetual state of bliss, playing on the beach and living off fruit, fish, and copious amounts of potent free-range cannabis. The unstable Daffy checks out of the party hotel by carving up his own wrists, but leaves behind a map to the hidden beach, which Richard discovers. Richard decides to go out in search of the beach, and takes along a young French couple he befriends along the way.Eventually the trio discovers the fabled beach, hidden in a cove on a government-controlled island and known to exist only by the people who live there and a corrupt group of Thai dope-farmers, who tolerate the presence of the Utopian community so long as they keep it secret and do not invite any new residents. The community is governed by its founders, principally Sal (Tilda Swinton), a regal, quasi-aristocratic hippie goddess. Indeed, it seems like the most important requirement in qualifying for membership in the community is being lean, hip, beautiful, and European (Richard is the only American). The group accepts the new arrivals, on the condition that they will not leave and that no one knows where they are or how to find them. Life seems perfect: they live off the land, sleep in a Swiss Family Robinson-ish compound, and re-stock themselves occasionally with worldly amenities (tampons, batteries for CD-players and hand-held video games, soap and shampoo, etc.) with clandestine trips to the mainland where Sal sells big bags of dope to a hotelier who keeps the island secret in exchange for a cheap source of grass to sell to the tackier late-adolescent tourists.All goes well for a while, until, predictably, 'trouble in paradise' emerges due to the typical jealousies and conflicts that are bound to happen in a scenario with a limited number of options for love and sexual companionship. Furthermore, Richard's position is imperiled by the fact that, before coming to the beach, he foolishly left a copy of the map with a pair of happy-go-lucky American stoners who had befriended him.Then a tragic event forces Richard and his naive friends to face the fact that, Utopian free-love idealism aside, Sal and her co-horts will act ruthlessly and callously to protect the sanctity of their island paradise. It's a typical 'Lord of the Flies' sort of scenario, not particularly believable or persuasive.The film was rightly judged as a failure, and the onus rests on two major factors: the casting of DiCaprio, and the collapse of the screenplay into incoherence at the mid-point.Leo has finally started to mature into a leading-man quality actor, but he was too thin and boyish when 'The Beach' was made to be believable as the maverick Richard. Many have bemoaned the decision to make Richard (an Englishman in the source novel) American, and it's safe to conclude that this decision was a cynical effort to appeal to US audiences by giving them a lead they can identify with more directly, played by a popular US actor. DiCaprio is a great actor, but it's hard to buy scrawny Leo as the principle object of female desire when he's surrounded by a cadre of buffed up Euro-studs.MacGregor would have made a much better Richard, undoubtedly, but even that wouldn't have saved the film, which careens off a self-indulgent neurotic cliff when the Richard character 'cracks up' in the film's final third. The narrative momentum grinds to a halt and never really recovers, and the conflict resolves itself with a disappointingly anti-climactic confrontation.Not a great film by any means, but it's gorgeous to look at, the actors are appealing (even Leo, despite being miscast, is engaging and relatively fun to watch), and, most of all, it's fun to fantasize about what it might be like to stumble into a world where the days consist of nothing more than frolicking on the beach, feasting on the bounty of the sea and the fat of the land, balling with the beautiful people, and staying high.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
It's... different.,"I watched ""The Beach"" shortly after it came out in 2000 and it left me kind of perplexed, although I was fairly entertained and the story kept my interest.The story involves an American youth, Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio), traveling in Thailand who learns of a paradisical beach hidden on an island off the coast many miles away. He ends up hooking up with a French couple and they travel to the island together.The reason ""The Beach"" leaves people a little puzzled is because it's so many thing. It's an adventure, a drama, a romantic triangle and an art house film with existential commentary. But somehow it all comes together and works as a whole, sort of.The beach community is somewhat of a modern hippie commune. Even the most equalitarian communities have a leader or leaders. In this case it's Sal (Tilda Swinton). Richard realizes he'll have to maintain her favor in order to remain in the paradise, even if her subtle demands are disrespectful and ultimately authoritarian. Since The Beach community is a paradise, anything that takes away from their sense of bliss must be removed. As they say, out of sight out of mind.Shot in Thailand, the film runs 2 hours.FINAL WORD: ""The Beach"" is an unusual film that is both entertaining and thought-provoking. There's really nothing else like it. And it's worthy of repeat viewings.GRADE: B+",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Spectacular Danny Boyle film in which some young people discover a strange island off the Thai coast,"Based on Alex Garland's novel which was a great sales and critical success, and here British director Danny Boyle has created a suspense and adventure film that features DiCaprio as the main protagonist in his first work in front of the cameras after the multimillion-dollar success of ¨Titanic¨. The flick packs emotion, nice settings, elaborate characters and a seamless combination of splendorous exteriors and nimble adventure. Every little scene has been given maximum detail, as environment and set design, backgrounds and lush frames showing overwhelming scenarios. Starring Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio), he is a cynical young North American backpacker who arrives in Thailand in search of adventure. Staying in a seedy motel, he runs into a French couple (Virginie Ledoyen and Guillaume Canet) and a paranoid, manic Englishman (Robert Carlyle) who gives him a a strange map to a supposedly unspoiled island off the Thai coast. Richad encourages the French to accompany him to the beach. There they encounter an odd settlement of Euro-trash people, headed by Sal (Tilda Swinton). Paradise has its price!.Innocence never lasts forever!.Somewhere on this planet it must exist!.Paradise Found - Innocence Lost!.It's the experience that matters!.It really was some kind of paradise!.This colorful film contains thrills, romance, action, adventure and gorgeous exteriors. DiCaprio follow-up to the blockbuster Titanic is an uneven adaptation of the novel written by Alex Garland concerning a group of hedonist younsters attempting to find a bizarre paradise and destroying their ideal in the process, as paradise turns out to be less paradisiacal than they thought. A captivating and emotional film that will amaze you with intense drama, intrigue, a triangular love story and adventures full of imagination, beauty and lavish settings.It displays a ¨New age¨ and sensitive musical score composed by means of synthesizer in
charge of recently deceased composer Angelo Badalamenti.

A movie by Danny Boyle with Leonardo DiCaprio in the leading role. Can there anything go wrong?,"The movie the beach was made in 2000 by the british director Danny Boyle. 
He made his breakthrough with the movie Trainspotting of the year 1996. He is responsible for many other good movies, for example 127 hours with James Franco, 128 days later or the very succesful slumdog millionaire. For me Trainspotting will be always Boyle's best movie. I have seen the beach approximately 1 year ago and i have to say that i wasn't dissappointed about this Drama film, even if the movie can't compete with the best movies of this british guy. Honestly the plot is not so exciting to watch this film more times. But an typical loosening Boyle atmosphere and easygoing Performance by a young Leonardo DiCaprio are enough for me to feel entertained. Leo is one of my favourite actors and i enjoyed it very much to see him in a not so mysterious role like in his younger movies Inception, Shutter Island or The Revenant. (Excepted The Wolf of Wallstreet)

Not as bad as all that,"Not as bad as all that. Deliberately evocative of ""Apocalypse Now"". I am presuming that that is an homage. Beautifully photographed scenery, including Virginie Ledoyen. She is major eye candy. Leonardo DiCaprio, as irritating as I find him, is actually quite a good actor. Anyone who doesn't believe that should rent ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"". He did a creditable job here, and you have to give him credit for taking this role, a rather unlikeable character, right after ""Titanic"". I would have found the lifestyle on the island awfully appealing in my 20's, a life of leisure, unlimited dope to smoke, etc. That wasn't enough for Richard (DiCaprio) however, and he falls into the category of adrenaline junkie. One thing, though, with all of those twentysomethings living on that island, it's hard to believe there were no children. I thought the direction was quite good throughout with the exception of the video game sequence. Dumb. I suppose it was meant to appeal to a demographic group which doesn't include me. Overall, I enjoyed watching the film, but will not be buying the DVD. Grade: C+",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

A stunning visual movie experience that was unfortunately brought down by the weak story.,"Although The Beach was an interesting and well acted film, it ended up contradicting what it was trying to say at the beginning. The scenery in incredible with the beautiful white sand beach that is completely isolated from the modern world, and the transition between the two when Richard and Sal traveled back for supplies was startling and very well presented.The unlikely premise of the film, a young traveling boy searching for the meaning of his life runs into a seemingly insane man in a third world motel room who decides to give him the map to paradise and then kill himself is a little hard to believe, but Robert Carlyle was wonderful as that man, and he easily stole every one of the few scenes he was in. After that, it was a fascinating adventure watching Richard and his two friends journey in search of that paradise. However, the unlikely events that led to the formation of that friendship is another thing that took away from the story.After the shark attack (not the laughable one where Richard actually wrestled with and killed the shark, taking it home for dinner, but the one where people were hurt and killed), the concept of paradise was a lot more realistic. It is true that a utopian society is not possible without some element of misery, and the man who was badly injured by the shark represented that misery. You cannot have absolute happiness without absolute misery. To put it in the classy and sophisticated words of Beavis and Butt-Head, ""If nothing sucked, and like, everything was cool all the time, then it's like, how would you know it was cool?""Richard's descent into temporary madness was a very creative and well done part of the film, in my opinion. The video game cinematography was not only original but it also cleverly represented his innocence and inexperience in the world. The acting in the film was very good, I think it should be noted that Leonardo DiCaprio delivered a brilliant and amazingly convincing performance, despite his terrible acting in Titanic. Besides that, the settings and camera work were excellent as well. Unfortunately, I just think that the story was contradictory and not thought out very well. The film stressed the importance of close friends and loyalty, but it seemed like it ended up emphasizing the importance of e-mail and iMac computers. Or maybe that was just a bit of clumsy and awkward product placement, maybe they were having problems getting people to bank-roll the film. Are they trying to say that a paradise such as the one in the film, if ever found, is impossible to keep? As a whole, I think that the film is trying to portray the destructive power of greed, but the message is so clouded with other distractive elements that it ends up looking and sounding confused and contradictory.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Or ""The Showcase""?","'The Beach' is an adaptation of Alex Garland's popular novel. The film is terrific to look at, and has some genuinely suspenseful moments, but ends up being a glossy showcase for Leonardo DiCaprio.Now, don't get me wrong - Leo is actually very good as the film's central protagonist, a hyper-cocky and brash Yankee tourist who discovers 'Paradise', only to ruin it. (But does he? And was it paradise to begin with?) Let's just say, he's along way from the box-office B.S. that was 'Titanic' (note for those who've been following my reviews: I am NOT touching that film - even I wouldn't stoop so low as to give time to that rubbish)However, the problem is that it's all about Leo. The rest of the cast fades to the background - and that includes Tilda Swinton, a brilliant performer who tries hard in the underdeveloped role of the island's icy leader. And Robert Carlyle, whose appearance is reduced to a mere cameo. They are there to make Leo angry, make Leo laugh, make Leo horny, make Leo afraid, etc, etcAnd, after a while ... well, one wonders whether it's worth it. Especially when Leo's character goes bonkers. It's very hard to feel pity for such a naive cretin (though one wonders whether they are supposed to). And it's hard not to laugh when Leo does Marlon Brando a la 'Apocalypse Now' (the horror, the horror!)With its insights about tourism, consumerism and democracy, 'The Beach' is a cut above much 'blockbuster' Hollywood fare. But only just. Leo might be a competent performer, but an overemphasis upon the young actor means the film is more indulgent than insightful.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
*** Dumb but atmospheric,"Another film that took a beating from the critics but wasn't really all that bad. It has gorgeous cinematography of exotic locations and has what is probably the best soundtrack for a film that I have ever owned. What it has going against it is a cast of sniveling little teenagers who think that acting like hippies and smoking reefer on a beach that never ends is the equivalent to living a free-spirited life away from the concerns of a terrifying modern world. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a young twenty-something with nowhere to go in life who while on vacation in Thailand hooks up with two French tourists (Guillaume Canet, Virginie Ledoyen) and together they follow a treasure map given to him by the crazed man in the next hotel room (cameo by Robert Carlyle). Where the map takes them is a pure, gorgeous stretch of beach inhabited by the aforementioned hedonists who watched too many Brady Bunch episodes as children and just can't let them go. Since the destruction of this paradise is obvious from the beginning, every cast member's surprise at how things turn out is really annoying. Leo does alright though, and Virginie Ledoyen is quite lovely, but the standout in the cast is British actress Tilda Swinton, here starring in one of her first major studio films. Unfortunately for this film's box-office failure, it will be a while before mainstream American audiences get to know her, but I'm sure with her immense talent and beauty it will happen soon.",,Anonymous,Romance
Make Up Your Mind,"On the surface, ""The Beach"" holds so much promise: a proven director and his crew, seasoned young actors, interesting story, and beautiful location.

The Beach,"The Beach was filmed in Phi Phi island, one of the small islands in southern Thailand.As soon as the movie was released thousands of tourists flocked to experience the same beach that Leonardo DiCaprio did in this movie.I actually went there, the boat operator did not want to land as it had too many people on the beach. I insisted, I travelled thousands of miles, he might as well go a further 20 meters!It is a nice beach.

It starts off with a young man seeking out an adventurous vacation and winding up changing his life (for better or worse?)This reminded me of several other movies I enjoyed watching, there is a little bit of Appocolypse now in fact there is a scene where people are watching a movie and it is in fact Apocolypse now... probably not a coincidence. Mix in a lot of Lord of the Flies and you get this movie.The acting is great all around, there are a lot of supporting characters in this one that work well together. The pacing is pretty good, you get introduced to the three main characters and watch their journey a la Stand By Me. I found the ending to be pretty satisfying.

"Good, but read the book!","""This is vastly different from the Richard that Alex Garland wrote in the source material. Garland's Richard is a polite, borderline selfless British traveler with dark hair. In other words, he's the polar opposite of Leonardo DiCaprio's self-involved adulterer. This isn't a drawback. Too many people draw novel-to-film comparisons, when the two mediums are far too different to be doing so. The Beach is a brilliant novel, and justifiably a cult classic. The film adaptation is compelling in its own respect.""As a separate film to the book, the movie was good, great locations, brilliant actors, and decaprio's solid acting. But, the movie didn't express the full toll on Richard (who was British) the extended time on the island did to him.Your find yourself agreeing with the character, and feel as if your going mad yourself.The film just didn't grasp that.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Utter trash,"I couldn't believe just how trashy this film is. To be fair the cinematography is good and it has a cool blue-ish tint that gives it a visceral edge -- but that's about it.The acting is bad. Leo DiCaprio is a great actor when he's given a chance (What's Eating Gilbert Grape, The Aviator, Catch Me If You Can) but here he's really just doing the whole boy-toy routine -- targeting the younger crowds of females rather than really trying to get into character.The plot isn't the greatest and the metaphors aren't deep -- the movie seems rather pretentious at times and tries to be heavier and more meaningful than it actually is.Of interesting note is that Danny Boyle (director of ""Trainspotting"") had a falling-out with star Ewan McGregor over this. McGregor was upset he wasn't cast in the film, and now refuses to film the sequel to ""Trainspotting,"" which is named ""Porno."" Considering that ""The Beach"" is quite easily one of Danny Boyle's worst films and one of the most disappointing pictures of the last decade... why the fuss, Ewan?

Why does paradise always have to destroy man?,"The Beach	 By Dean KishWhen Hollywood is faced with idea or image of paradise, why does it always become so bloody? 	`The Beach' marks the return of Leonardo DiCaprio to the silver screen after his frozen corpse disappeared off the edge of the Titanic. DiCaprio joins with `Trainspotting' director Danny Boyle as a twenty something year old, Richard, exploring the allure of the Far East. He takes a room in a seedy motel where he comes in contact with a psychotic drug-user Daffy (played by Robert Carlyle). Daffy shares a joint with DiCaprio and tells him of a paradise that no man should mistake is there. He tells an urban legend about a mythical beach incased in cliffs and cut off from the world. DiCaprio shrugs it off as a wild story until the next morning where he finds a map tacked to his door. 	`The Beach' could have been a beautiful romance set against an epic adventure as Leo's character teams up with a young French couple to find the mythical `Beach'. But when we are introduced to what makes the mythical island tick the movie takes a strange `Lord of the Flies' direction as the island's world will do what ever it takes to preserve their paradise.The scenery and imagery director Boyle conveys brings you in and captivates your attention. The beginning's scope and deliverance reminded me a lot of `The Blue Lagoon' and `Castaway'. Both of these films had great potential but ran out of story before reaching fruition. `The Beach' instead mixes the potential seen in `The Blue Lagoon' with an acid trip from `Lord of the Flies'. The end result is heavily flawed hero that you either hate or you are extremely confused about. This is no way to paint an adventure hero. 	As a critic I will pity the masses hoping for another epic romance from DiCaprio. So exactly where does the `Beach' fit into Leo's acting career. I would have to say it proves undeniably the melding and molding his career is taking. The first half of the film we have the Hollywood star but as the film enters its second half we see the heavily flawed characters he treasured earlier in his career. The films I am referring to are `Total Eclipse' and `Basketball Diaries'. 	`The Beach' does deliver a lot of allure which made me want to see a really good island adventure movie. Which did make me wonder did this film ever want to really explore that avenue. Coupled with that allure, I found myself feeling more for the heroine Françoise (played by beautiful French newcomer Virginie Ledoyen) then for Leo's Richard. Why does paradise always have to destroy man? Well it destroyed the Beach. (3.5 of 5) So says the Soothsayer.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A 180 for Leo,"Leonardo DiCaprio, in a good portrayal of today's youth, does a 180 degree turn from 'Titanic' in this film which has a communal look, dives into the true aspects of human nature and has a tense climax.

Perhaps the film's biggest triumph is that it proves what the world is all about.....that Utopia DOES NOT exist.",,Anonymous,Romance
superb!,"I never went to see 'The Beach' or even bothered to rent it. The first time i saw it it was on television and i expected it to be just 'ok'. However 'The Beach' proved to be an intensely exciting film and was completely different from what i had expected and had been led to believe. The second time i saw it i found it even better than before. Many other reviews say that it was an insult to the original novel which i haven't read, so i wouldn't be able to judge that. People have said that the film is dumbed down and even a movie aimed at teenagers, i disagree with this, just because it doesn't seem to be a 'deep' movie and hasn't been marketed in this way doesn't mean that it is for morons, it has a lot of meanings and if you can't see them then it is a problem with you, not the movie. The acting is brilliant and the soundtrack is equally good. I don't understand how some people hate this film but enjoy other films like 'Meet the Fockers' which i think is 100% trash!

Expensively produced cheap entertainment--a fantasy without the treasure,"The Beach (2000)You want to like this movie, for sure. It's about a dream come true, if if you've ever travelled even a little in this backpacker Gringo trail kind of way, you'll feel like you're there.But then, it's also just a movie, and it shows an indulgence now and then, an implausibility not in the big idea (which is absurd--and digitally invented, by the way, the beach part), but in certain interactions. The people are implausible, the situation, the feel good idealism. When it goes bad, it's only in a ridiculous way (the first hint is when our star, Leonardo DiCaprio, defends himself from a shark and he gets blamed for making the shark angry).The beach itself is a kind of tropical trope (I never thought I'd get the chance to say that--tropical trope, tropical trope). That is, it is only what perfect beaches are--protected sands, aqua waters, no bugs, no snakes, no poor natives trolling for alms. It's a kind of Club Med without the corporation. So naturally it's appealing, but only in a superficial way. And the whole movie echoes this obviousness, this shallowness. Even the big conflicts are kind storybook simplistic, and a bit silly, or overly sad (near the end, with the shootings).DiCaprio is terrific, really likable. The other famous star is Tilda Swinton who does her best in a role that maybe didn't have room for much depth--she's the ruler queen of sorts. The others I didn't know (a couple are director Danny Boyle regulars, it seems). Oh, did I say Danny Boyle? Yes, this is a film by the guy who did Slumdog Millionaire and Trainspotting, both throbbing, excessive, and amazing movies in their own ways. And probably equally insensitive (to the poor in India, the anti-drug forces), so it's no surprise that he stepped on the toes of the locals when filming ""The Beach"" by bulldozing the beach and ignoring protests. (The big tsunami reshaped it back to what it was, a small consolation for that disaster.)So, if you don't mind a lot of niggling issues and downright meaninglessness, and just want to fantasize a bit, you might enjoy a lot of this movie. You might settle for Cape Cod, though, if that's your second choice.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pretty good movie. Deserves a better rating here.,"Ignore the low rating here on IMDb. This movie is some decent and pretty looking entertainment. It's a movie were basically is very little wrong with. It's a movie made without any potential and in the long run it's a pretty good and entertaining enough movie.It's very simple to say why this movie 'flopped'. Reason for this was Leonardo DiCaprio. Now don't get me wrong, I'm no Leo hater, that's not my point. My point is, you have to consider the fact that this movie was released in 2000, 3 years after his role in ""Titanic"". Most of the male audience couldn't stand DiCaprio after his sappy role in this movie but most girls loved him. That's why the guys didn't went to see ""The Beach"" when it was released and also females didn't went to see it because this is a totally different movie and role for DiCaprio. So it was the wrong timing or the casting, both are possibilities, which caused this movie to not be a very successful one at the box office and among critics because they were not at the time quite ready yet to see DiCaprio in a totally different role, even though in the past he already had played a wide diversity of roles.Too bad because the movie really deserved a better faith. Granted that it's no masterpiece but than again it doesn't really try to be one. The story doesn't really try to go deep, even though they could had easily gone that way with it. Instead it's a movie with multiple layers in it that go in good into some certain issues handled in the movie. The movie tries to be as realistic as possible even though the story at times certainly isn't. A reason why ""The Beach"" is just a good movie and not a great one.The movie is beautiful looking and has some nice settings. The directing is quite original at times which helps to give the movie its own unique feeling. Also the story helps to make this movie an original one and it's quite thought provoking at certain moments.Leonardo DiCaprio shows with this movie once more that he is more than just a pretty face. He's a real talented actor and this movie truly shows his, by many yet undiscovered, talent. Robert Carlyle is also great in a fairly small but still important role. A nice surprise in the movie was Guillaume Canet. This is a great French actor, who mainly only makes French movies and already has been nominated twice for a César Award. (Let's say the French Oscar for French movies.)A simple entertaining movie made without any potential. Would it had been released let's say 5 years later it would had received a better faith and a more wider audience. A perfectly watchable movie but of course by no means a must-see though.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Has it's flaws but I was pleasantly surprised.,"It's a fascinating film that delves into a whole bounty of themes (though this sometimes comes across as the film not really knowing what it wants to be, to me at least) and features a sensational performance from DiCaprio. I saw Richard as naive and selfish and really sitting on the border between man and boy, and I think this comes across wonderfully in Leo's performance. He has instances of extreme maturity (like saving the French couple from the drug farmers when they first arrive on the island) and then moments of extreme immaturity, like talking about Daffy being incinerated while laughing.Some of the choices in the style were really tasteless from my perspective (the scene with Richard and Francoise making love in the water and the scene with Richard inside the video game being the two best examples) but these instances were rare. It does drag a little bit in the middle and the relationship between Richard and Sal seemed really soap opera-esquire but once he was forced into isolation it really picked up into my favorite part of the entire film. This extremely unique study of the isolation of someone who's not quite a man driving him insane was exceptional. His ability to adapt to the jungle while also playing immature little games is just another example of this boy/man battle that was constant throughout.The main story of the film is a bit contrived (I never really bought into the ""hidden island paradise"" thing) and the ending was a bit ridiculous as well. The dialogue was pretty poor sometimes to the point of being cringe-worthy but DiCaprio's exceptional performance really helps to hold together some of the sub-par elements of the film; Tilda Swinton was also pretty great. Overall, I nit-picked at a lot of little things but I found it to be quite good.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

It is basically about a backpacker who thinks he has found something different, but quickly discovers how insular and distorted the community he finds himself in is. I think this film makes a great point about how destructive inward-looking groups can be. Leonardo di Caprio's acting is a bit forced and over the top at times, and some things happen in the film which beggar belief, but overall it's a thoughtful account of the need for 'something more' in the lives of lots of young people, and how that 'something more' may not be travel, but a sense of community.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Utter dreadful piece of toss,"What a boring, uninspired piece or crud this movie turned out to be. I just saw it on TV for the first time and can only assume it was made with two types of people in mind. The first are people who have never travelled abroad. The second are people so self absorbed that they don't actually get what travelling is all about, and are so hell bent on getting an experience that they fail to notice the culture right in front of them. Selfish, narsissistic, awful people. Frankly people I don't find worthy of having a movie made about them, and since no one seems to make this sort of observation, I can only assume a movie written and made by just this sort of incapable person.

Surprisingly Good,"I admit that as I was walking into the movie theater I was very hesitant about seeing a movie with Leo DiCaprio and even more hesitant about seeing a gory movie. However, I was pleasantly surprised with DiCaprio's performance and amazed by the way the director portrayed Richard's transformations and stages throughout the movie.The gory part of it...yes it was bloody. I closed my eyes for all the close ups of blood, however I do admit that it was probably necessary for it to be there so that the right message could be conveyed.What is the message? I asked myself over and over again as I walked out of the movie. Is it about how hard we try to be unique, but then end up being same as everyone else, or do our experiences still matter even if we do wind up being what we feared most. Richard can be paralleled to Tarzan at first glance, or he can be more accurately seen as Holden Caufield. The cocky attitude, the need to break free from the ties of society, all that is there. The island, the hidden world, perhaps is all Richard's imagination, and everything that happens to him there, is the sad realization of truth and reality.Many themes and threads are drawn through this movie, much food for thought...or so it was for me.",,Anonymous,Romance
A must-see for DiCaprio fans and an enjoyable no-brainer for all others.,"This DiCaprio tour-de-force focuses on the misadventures of a rebellious young tourist in Thailand.

Missed the Boat,"DiCaprio is over exposed in this difficult movie dedicated to the psychology of the advanced backpacker. Some Backpackers do their time and go back to start their careers while some want to drag out the process. The constant search for better drugs, a better beach, a better party...  The locale is well researched. Dope growing in that area is a viable alternative to fishing. The ""Beach"" does exist but you don't need a secret map to find it. The problem with the film is that we get too much Leonardo. The film would have benefited from a more egalitarian distribution of screen time. Less star power and more characterization. Other characters are barely traced. To create the ""alternative universe"" we needed to get to know its members. The shark attack and aftermath would have had greater impact had we cared more for the unfortunates attacked. With DiCaprio recruited for the project it must have been too much to ask of the makers not to milk him for what it was worth despite the effect this had on the finished flick. Not having read the book I cannot comment on the adaptation, however I suspect that it is an individual's odyssey, which may be a problem for any film adaptation.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

DiCaprio is good in this but it is far far from being his best work because it doesn't showcase his talent fully.

Getting away from it all may not be perfection paradise after all?,"I first viewed this film upon its release and felt that the final third did the film down - and that the voice-over took away from the essence of the story, thus it's average. My subsequent viewings over the years would see me lament about an arcade game sequence and bemoaning that Robert Carlyle wasn't given a more extended role, yet it has become a film that sees me totally on board with director Danny Boyle's production and it's now that I think it puts the story together with poignant precision.Leonardo DiCaprio is Richard, a backpacker searching for a bit more in life, after a meeting with pot smoking loony Daffy (the wonderful Robert Carlyle), he learns of an island paradise that is everything he has yearned for in his life. Getting there will give him the adventure and danger he craves, because once there it apparently will be the thing of dreams, the perfect paradise cut off from civilisation...The film is very much split in two, the first half introduces us to Richard and the people he would convince to travel with him to this island paradise, we then follow their journey that is perfect in fleshing out the characters, they come up against obstacles and learn about each other on the way. The second half is well worth waiting for because it's here that the story kicks in to make the viewer think, it's idyllic, it's gorgeous, it's near perfect, but wherever there is a community, there will be personal hang ups, jealousies, power seekers and etc, in short, the surroundings may be perfect but the human condition is far from flawless.I love this film now, I love DiCaprio's performance, a cocky smart- arse thrill seeker about to get a wake up call is tailor made for him, and he delivers it with a skillful array of emotions. Director Danny Boyle does a great job of juggling the joys of paradise with the uneasy distortion of the various characters in the community, and the cinematography from Darius Khondji is truly beautiful (Thailand locales). The film suffers with the inevitable comparisons to Lord Of The Flies & Hearts Of Darkness, and yes these are fair comparisons, but it doesn't take away from the fact that it's a fine film for the modern generation in its own right, with the core point of the story relevant to all and sundry.Fans of the novel would prove to be very ambivalent towards this filmic adaptation, but in my book it gets better on repeat viewings. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great one,"Leonardo DiCaprio sought to distance himself from the purity of his character in Titanic, and his role in The Beach is in many ways a polar opposite. As Richard, a young American seeking to ""suck in the experience"" of freestyle travel in Thailand, he's a chronic liar, a pot-smoking hedonist, an amoral lover, and ultimately an unstable snake in a doomed Garden of Eden. This crazy descent might be expected from the filmmakers of Trainspotting, but The Beach is a movie without a rudder, venturing into fascinating territory, promising a stimulating adventure, and then careening out of control. After receiving a not-so-secret map to a secluded island from a stoned-out loony (Robert Carlyle, full of dark portent and spittle), Richard sets out to find the hidden paradise with a young French couple (Virginie Ledoyen, Guillaume Canet). What they find is a tropical commune existing in delicate balance with Thai pot farmers, and before long--as always--there's trouble in paradise. There's trouble in the movie, too, as DiCaprio is reduced to histrionics when the plot turns into a muddled mix of Lord of the Flies and Apocalypse Now, with shark attacks tossed in for shallow tension. Director Danny Boyle attempts perfunctory romance and a few audacious moves (notably DiCaprio's vision of life as a violent video game), but what's the point? Tilda Swinton registers strongly as the commune's charismatic leader, but her character--and the entire film--remains largely undeveloped, and pretty scenery is no guarantee of a laudable film.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
What's the movie about?,"Who told  Danny Boyle that it would be a good movie if you put Leonardo di Caprio on a tropical island and let him do a little bit of fishing? I don't want to see that.There is no real style in the movie. It seems to be a bad mixture of ""The blue lagoon"", ""Lord of the flies"" and a music video.Everytime I thought that the movie was getting better I was disappointed. It could have been a very funny and ironic scene when  the hippy dude was playing the guitar at the funeral (I thought about ""Four weddings and a funeral""). But no, Danny Boyle tried to make us believe that the hippy community was really sorry.And what's the movie about anyway? My suggestion is: Nobody wants to go back working after a great vacation.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Phi Phi Leha,"First thing to write at the start: don't be influenced by critics bad review on this one. Danny Boyle is one of my favorite directors and it's true that The Beach is different that anything he's done before, many would say too commercial. The idea was to put together Boyle's talent with Hollywood budget and keep best from both.Perhaps Boyle did loose a bit of his harsh style, but not so much you couldn't recognize it's Boyle - especially in the Duffy's monologues and wacky part where Richard is loosing himself. Actors gave good performances, Richard's ( Leonardo Di Caprio) cocky style and Francoise's elegance (played by Virginie Ledoyen) work good together for romance part. Screenplay is good, supporting Boyle's way of directing with sometimes raw, ""youth way"" monologues and conversations that fit good.The biggest lack, in my opinion, is a ""ideal society"" part. In Alex Garland's story, on which is film based, it's one of the main questions and occupations of the writer. Boyle should have gone deeper on this subject, this way I had feeling that the end is a bit incomplete.And here is the best part - cinematography with heavenly beautiful landscape (I couldn't resist to move my rating from 7/10 to 8/10 just because of it). Yes, for all those who thought (including me, I admit) it was digitally supported - the beach and the island are real - it's Phi Phi Leha island in Thailand. It's probably the best landscape I've ever seen in any film. Unfortunately, it was destroyed by tsunami in 2004., so this is the only way to discover its beauties if you haven't seen this paradise personally.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Something completely different then the previews!,"Whoa,Coming into this movie I was expecting sort of an action/adventure.  Leo vs. the drug dealers to save the island...that sort of thing.  Completely wrong.The movie is a wild trip into the mind of a guy who thinks he's found perfection.  It's all about the beginnings of perfections and ultimate loss of perfection that is inevitable.I'm sort of a Leo fan, but I thought his performance in this was pretty stellar.  He's funny, but in parts where his character breaks down, he's very un-Leoish.Danny Boyle (Trainspotting) brings together the piece really well.  At points I thought the movie was rough around the edges and at other times I thought the movie was too perfect.  He creates some beautiful scenes though, look for the part involving ""Video-Game Richard,"" especially good.A major beef was the sound track.  Way too poppy and pleasant in the whole ""revelation"" scenes.Go see it though.  Figure it out for yourself.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
They came in such of paradise,"One of the main problems is the lack of empathy we have with anyone. It is not surprising that we fail to empathise, since the characters have so little empathy for each other. Perhaps the intention is to show a group of middle-class pleasure-seekers as they really are: selfish, narcissistic and cruel, and that their retreat from the world is really an attempt to escape their own petty nastiness.This is an interesting idea, but director Danny Boyle's technique is not up to the task. Neither is the script. For most of the film, we seem to be watching a travelogue combined with a MTV music video. The self-consciously 'cool' soundtrack detracts rather than enhances the experience. Some cack-handed attempts at drama involve unconvincing arguments which spring out of nowhere, such as the waterfall altercation. The story improves when Di Caprio starts to lose his marbles. This is undermined by Boyle's gimmicky effects, such as the annoying video game sequence.Of the actors, only Paterson Johnson emerges well. He brings a good deal of likability to the role, something of a relief among the Islanders, and I wish the whole story had revolved around his much more interesting and human character.In the end,we are left with unanswered questions and a great feeling of dissatisfaction.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
a version of Paradise,"Admirable work. for cinematography, for script, for many performances. more important, for the virtue to be a kind of Swedish buffet- for each viewer a interesting dish. film about freedom and adventure, youth and a place out of social demands, it has the gift to reflect old slices of Utopia, spirit of an age, the Biblical references to temptation and a Leonardo Di Caprio in high energetic role. sure, it could be criticize. or defined as masterpiece . or discovered as a revelation. in fact, the wise science to use the novel for a thriller who gives few good scenes, a credible story and a cast who is far to be bad are the good points for The Beach. and, in same measure, the remind of old dreams about a magnificent place and its comfortable peace.",,Anonymous,Romance

Let's go see Leonardo !Well the thing is not so bad, but it is definitely for an MTV audience. Some of the scenes are stunning and amazingly beautiful.  The first half is interesting enough, and makes you attentive to the story.  But then, it seems to be a mish mash of video-clips.  The Game Boy scene is kinda funny in the delirium part of the movie.  But the psychology of it all is pretty primitive, and could have been much better.All the ""drama"" scenes seem to be picked up somewhere else.  I suppose the director was making a wink to Apocalypse Now at some point, if not, he really messed up that part of the story.  And the character development in the club-med-in-paradise environment could have been MUCH better.It could have been a great movie, but I think they pushed hard to put Leonardo too much in front of everything.  Good acting, I must admit, but overshadowed by a movie that tries to be too much of everything at the same time : ecology, sociology, humanism, sex, vacation, action, ...  Too bad.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Good, but with blemishes.","When all's said and done, this is a good movie.Unfortunately, it's not *quite* top ten material.I like Leonardo Di Caprio - I have ever since Romeo and Juliet, although I've never seen Titanic (don't hit me!). In _The Beach_, he is good - his acting was definitely up to standard. However, there is a sequence in the middle of the movie where Danny Boyle (the director) seems to lose the plot a little.Something happens to Di Caprio's mind (I'm not going to say what), but we're never really given an adequate explanation for it. It's like twenty minutes of the film was left on the cutting room floor.Having said that, it's an interesting take on the _Lord of the Flies_ theme. Rather than order descending into chaos and savagery, it's more a movie about what happens when there's too much order, and people become unable to give that order, that comfort, up. What happens when you're too scared to leave your comfort zone? Well, watch this movie and you'll find part of that answer out.Altogether good, but not great.

From what I know Boyle makes most of his films based upon novels, and I make it a point to not read the novel to enjoy the film. The Beach doesn't disappoint and while some characters could have been more roles -- Ledoyen was practically paraded through the entire movie -- the premise and the beautiful locales make it a film worth watching.

Perfect backpacker movie,"I first saw the beach in the early 2000s when I was still quote young and had not done any backpacking or much travel. I didn't think much about the movie at the time and thought it was far fetched and it didn't leave a strong impression on me.I've since done some long backpacking trips and spent my fair share of time in hostels in far flung locations. My impression changedThe beach really captures the backpacker spirit of freedom, adventure and longing to find places off the beaten trail, disconnect from society, check out of the rat race.The characters and scenarios could be ripped straight from the backpacker trails of Southeast Asia. Rag tag groups of young travellers meeting on the road knowing not much more than each other's names travelling together on shaky buses, old trains and boats.The story is essentially a backpacker fantasy. Finding that one place unspoiled by tourism where you can truly unplug and check out from society for a while. Love triangles and whirlwind romances on moonlit beaches.

Trouble in paradise.,"A young traveler (Leonardo DiCaprio)is intent on taking a vacation different from all others. He meets a French couple in Asia and convinces them to trek with him to a secretive island. Upon their arrival they find the island is as perfectly beautiful as they were told. The island is secluded, but inhabited on one side by a commune and the other by drug dealing farmers.This film does not live up to the hype, but is a very scenic movie. It will keep the DiCaprio fans happy. Virginie Ledoyen, who plays Francoise, is a natural beauty. She is charming and very easy to like. DiCaprio puts in a very tight performance and his eyes speak volumes. The strongest acting comes from Robert Carlyle (Daffy), who provides the travelers with the map to the island before his suicide.The movie does contain some manic action and violence, but it takes awhile to get there. Not a total disappointment. Pop a top, kick back and enjoy.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

Nothing like as bad as some people would like you to think,"OK, I haven't read the book, so I can't compare the film to it.  However, on viewing the film for the first time, I was extremely surprised to see that it is actually quite good.  From what some people have written here, saying that means that I don't deserve to live, but it is my opinion and as valid as anyone elses.  I think that a lot of the negative feeling must arise from people hoping that Leonardo DiCaprio would make a bad movie because of his success with Titanic.  I think the problem is simply that this is not a mainstream movie, and it's just not going to appeal to a lot of people who have no taste for movies that require you to think. I think that Leo made quite a brave choice in doing this movie as he could have done anything he wanted.  If it wasn't for Leo being in it and the consequential hype surrounding this movie at the time of release, etc, it probably would have become a cult favorite.  Even now, I think there is a chance that it will be rediscovered in a few years.",,Anonymous,Romance

This is exactly the culture of so many backpackers to Thailand - find the best remotest coolest place to get stoned and party.I loved the part where DiCaprio acts out Apocalypse Now, smug in his superiority in actually messing with the working farmers, rather than sitting in a theatre watching the movie, completely uncaring about the consequences to anyone but himself.But the best part is at the end, when he is back home and is completely unchanged from the people who never experienced what he has, except for a picture of his group partying.

Poor scripting is insignificant as Brill Boyle sets up another wonder,"Richard (Di Caprio) stumbles across a map that gives the location to an island that contains all the elements for a peaceful existence.Almost 10 years ago, Danny Boyle controversially left behind his Trainspotting and A Life less Ordinary star Ewan McGregor and was replaced by one of America's biggest stars for the leading role in the adaptation of Alex Garland's novel.With Di Caprio still a heart throb after his roles in Titanic and Romeo and Juliet this was arguably the change in his career as he progressed into cinema's more dramatic genre. His articulate soft spoken style works wonders and whilst this is by no means his best ever performance, he is the necessity element that holds the script together.As the film gets under way with the actor's narration explaining the formality of everyday holidays and the problems with the system Danny Boyle uses an element he lives for, the setting.From 28 days later to Slumdog Millionaire the Bury born director simply knows how to set the scene in a way that is perfectly in line with the situation on screen. This beginning is perfectly realistic of a person in a foreign land adjusting to the scene as Di Caprio flits around the buyers and sellers in the market. But when the film finally reaches the beach does Boyle's presence really become profound.It may sound cheesy but the setting sweeping notion feels as if you are right there on that island as Boyle swoops around the dreaming paradise. The helicopter shots and the bird eye view snaps generate a unique essence of the freedom and imagination of the supposed concept of independent holiday as Di Caprio and his friends end up in the midst of a hidden tribe.The idea alone is brilliant. To escape and not have rules and regulations seems too sceptical for the everyday person like Di Caprio's Richard but after a run in with the marvellous Robert Carlyle the clues are dropped and the journey to the island itself is brilliant with some stunning shots in the water.As the film progresses there are numerous factors that generate the essence of drama juxtaposed with fantasy. Richard's secret hinders with some questionable dialogue but the power of the performance neglects the scripting. There is an inclusion of romantic lust that is fairly predictable but the outcome certainly isn't.There are other problems with this picture. For example the scripting is insignificant. Nothing is spoken unless it is a cue for drama to be created or for the plot to move forward. The bizarre game styled fantasy of Richard's is too out of place for the context of the moment.The ending is a let down because of the way the conclusion was assumed. Nevertheless Boyle's filming and accurate talent at depicting the setting with the situation is the main reason to check this out.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Maybe it's British sensibility but I quickly found the voice over narration totally annoying. As the character went through the pacing, I found myself not really caring about him. What a blow hard and naive little puppy. I do not fault Di Caprio's part but I do fault the writing. There is no logic in why this person does what he does unless he's a complete idiot. They walk into a field of marijuana like they are taking a leisurely stroll through Busch Gardens. Parts of Jamaica is like this and the tourist boards knows that. You can't go into certain parts of the island because there are marijuana fields under armed control. And with this film, everything is telegraphed with emotions. There are no surprises and common sense apparently is in extreme short supply.

Movie V. Book,"Let's start with the good points of the movie: -Leonardo DiCaprio (duh) -Beautiful island, waterfall, beach, longhouse.But I do hate this movie for ruining the book. They changed the plot too much, and all-in-all I don't really mind that too much. But they completely missed the point of the book, and the filming didn't show any of the mystery atmosphere that I felt when I read the book. The only good idea in the filming department that I saw was how they showed Richard's game of picking dope as a computer game. But I was disappointed about how Mr. Duck played a very small role in the movie, and his accent stopped me from actually understanding a single word he was saying (DVD had no subtitles). And another big disappointment- they completely missed out Jed, one of the main characters! But, I guess, this movie would seem better to me if I hadn't read the book first. I kept comparing the two which distracted me from enjoying it. Conclusion: The movie is watchable, but the book is so much better.

Hmmm . . .,"Some thoughts (for whatever they are worth)-- The Beach has several Trainspotting-like moments of inspired glee mixed within the overall darker elements of the story (Richard's dark dementia broken up with a little goofy video game bit, for example). It just doesn't seem to work as smoothly and perfectly as Trainspotting, altho The Beach isn't *that* bad a flick.- One thing another poster mentions is the Beautiful People mold that the Beach inhabitants seem to have been mass produced from. While there is a false sense of glamour and youth in the casting of thin/young/beautiful people, maybe that lends itself as a stark contrast to the very dire circumstances and consequences of their actions. These people are attractive and young and hip, yet they are proven to be ultimately silly and frivolous when faced with the reality of their actions.

DiCaprio gives his best performance since What's Eating Gilbert Grape, and though I have never been much of a fan of DiCaprio's (AT ALL) I found his teaming up with Trainspotting director Boyle was a good bet.

Racist dope story without any sense,"The press screening in Germany became a nightmare like some visit at the dentist's. Having been to Thailand six times in my life, I wondered how Danny Boyle would catch one of it's most beautiful sights, the island Phi Phi Leh. Not only did Boyle mix reminiscence to APOCALYPSE NOW (not even managing to quote it's moody fans correctly) and THE DEER HUNTER (the ""Russian Roulette"" scene, but this time with a childish and frightened DiCaprio), he also intertwined a video game with the protagonist running through a virtual jungle. This mix of styles was as empty as the whole plot. No Thai would allow dozens of foreigners to stay on their island for such a long time the way those dope-addicted hippies did. No shark would appear to bite them. No marijuana farmers would shoot them. The only restricted areas in Thailand that equal paradises are on military ground. All the suspense in THE BEACH is based on lies. So it comes as no surprise that the Thais are now blaming the film crew for having destroyed some natural surroundings of the island. Clear as one can see that neither the writer of the novel nor the filmmaker have any understanding of Thailand' true soul, they probably didn't even respect it's natural beauty. So this might be the only parallel to the filming of the masterpiece APOCALYPSE NOW: Wherever an American filmcrew invades, the place is changed to their needs. And they are mostly commercial.Look for some characters (the French tourist, Swinton's boyfriend) and see their figures stuck in the story. Nothing develops.

Often they make a travel to solve the problem, story develops all surrounding the problem or obstacle.""The Beach"" has the quality of not being of a story, but more like a quest. It is about a group of youngsters fleeing from a frenzy society to form one of their own, and is good material leading to a profound narration, and Boyle uses his knowledge over the sublimation of messages and subtleties to accomplish it's goal: Society at it's most crude form develops, over a study of spatial behavior and human mentality, leadership and a poignant portrait of the Society's hierarchy and it's components.This film is not conventional. It's about a form of discovery, when in the beach, a calm beach; we stay in contact with Nature and rediscover our most basic needs and desires.

"Utterly Unwatchable, Except for Tilda Swinton","""Now get some sleep. I may want to have sex again in the morning."" That's practically the only interesting line from THE BEACH, an incredibly unconvincing and suspense-less film about a bunch of rich backpackers who stumble onto the ""perfect"" beach in Thailand.Leonardo DiCaprio is supposed to be the boy who goes wild in the jungle -- kind of like casting Hugh Grant to play Rambo. I don't want to say that Leo is a total girly-man -- I mean, I know he dates super models and he used to hang with a tough bunch of skateboarders who called themselves the p**sy posse -- but somehow watching him run up and down the jungle trails waving his big knife I just wanted to giggle. For about ten seconds. Then I got bored. For about two hours.The one bright spot in all this darkness is shapely, statuesque and thoroughly charismatic Tilda Swinton. She plays Sal, the leader of the secluded beach community, who will do anything to protect her home. There's nothing giggly about her performance. She's utterly right. Tilda makes you buy that this woman is strong, smart, sensible, and utterly in control. That goes for her bedroom scenes with Leo, too. Though her motives for sleeping with him are somewhat cloudy, it's clear that she's the one making the decisions and that he responds almost against his will. There's something quite provocative about the way she takes him to bed, tires him out, and then says, ""now get some sleep. I may want to have sex again in the morning."" It's unsettling and unexpected and very, very sexy.Now if only that scene could have lasted for two hours!",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
A film that really makes you wonder,"Well I have to admit that it was a film that didn't belong on my ""must see"" list, and after eventually renting it for the third time and Really watching it. I guess you could say that it was... watchable. When I actually bought it and watched it some more, it really began to grow on me. Now I have to confess it did help with the purchase of the absolutely superb soundtrack, which by far does the film justice.Now I haven't read the book, and after watching the film I don't think I want to, I mean This is a story about a BEACH, about PARADISE, about taking a chance and traveling to find that one place we wish would exist. Inevitably it is found, or is it? Leo Dicapro's performance was to say none too spectacular, but watchable, I mean I suppose you could say that at times I wish I was in his shoes, living the care free life with complete strangers on a paradise island. But I really wasn't paying attention to him. It was great to start off with, and when they finally reached the island, I thought wow, wouldn't it be great to be there?. I thought the scene where Keaty was trying to explain cricket was hilarious and when they got their tattoos done, SPot on. But then what happened? it just seemed to fall apart. The Idea of him going crazy by himself would probably explain that he would have ended up like Taffy, Mad, Stoned and suicidal, after being kicked out of the community. However, I think you could say it had it all, adventure, love, betrayal, action, gore a not too disappointing storyline and by far the most beautiful scenery ever imainged.

The story seemed intriguing enough,but, while an entertaining flick, it was nothing special, sorry. Just exactly what is wrong and what isn't with this film? The first hour is almost great,right from the very first shot. It's all very stylish, colourful,with an excellent cinematography.The  Carlyle cameo is very good, the female lead is pretty wonderful, Tilda Swinton plays Sal in exactly the way I expected the character to be, and DiCaprio is not everywhere. There are flaws here and there, of course:the screenplay doesn't follows the original story too much,Leo almost gets the girl-or should I say girls?-but all in all everything's shaping up quite nicely. Then everything goes wrong,and the last 30-40 minutes are almost embarrassing, from a gung-ho Leo to the confrontation with the drug dealers-completely different to what happens in the movie-to the final escape. Here,the movie loses its balance, It's Leo,Leo,Leo everywhere, and it all goes downhill. Too bad.

Perfect for the unbearably hot recession-hit summer months,"After seeing the movie for the first time , I must conclude that it is a very good product by D.Boyle , perhaps the most popular and financially successful British director to date ,whose film canon includes an impressive array of various genres , ranging from comedies ( Trainspotting ) to Sci - Fi with Sunshine ,and his last academy winner The Slumdog Millionaire .The Beach is a most welcome film for this Indian summer, as it deals with ,well, a last strip of paradise ,whose precise location is a sort of modern tourist legend, and the arrival of three youngsters ,led by Leo De Caprio , who discover a sort of modern hippie commune there, where love – read -sex and partner sharing – soft drugs –the island is virtually ideal for growing opiates !, briefly- carefree ' joie de vivre ' are the only rule ,and where the only contacts to the Thai mainland are restricted to the monthly procurement of necessities done only by the select few .The eternal bliss is , of course, doomed , as the inevitable ,namely the forces of nature ( diseases ,injuries –there are no doctors there ,and if the need be , you cannot - once on the mainland – return or disclose the location ! , and the most destructive one ,that is the most human one , jealousy ) dictate the lives there as well .This movie shows the true nature of modern tourist industry that cares not a fig about national , religious or cultural sensibilities( observe the depiction of now infamous Thai sex tourism ,making one wonder if there is really nothing else except girls and the indulgence of the most perverted sexual whims and proclivities !) , and draws its power from human gullibility , and , first and foremost, vacuous, meaningless and jaded human lives under the slogan of ' Enjoy '.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Interesting idea, but that was all.","Interesting idea and I believe that the book was very good. However the film seemed to rush through important parts, and then slowly shift through some other parts. Boyle is a very different director, but I think that at parts in went over the top with some of his surreal scenes.Leonardo DiCaprio did another great acting job however I think that it wasn't his style. The other cast around him for me seemed very woody, and not real, apart from Daffy (played by Robert Carlyle) who brought the film a small bit of life.The plot was sound, it could have done however with some extra parts so that some of the jumps in the story line were not too sudden. The ending was also poor, however the start was faultless, and well portrayed.The film overall was okay, it had some interesting scenes, like DiCaprio, as a computer character, which added something most films lack.

Laughable,"This movie is so bad, it works better as a comedy. From what I understand, the book is quite good, but the adaptation misses the mark so badly its funny.Where to begin? This was obviously meant as a post Titanic star vehicle for young Leo in 1999. The problem, Leo was not a good actor in his 20s. He was trying to play men with a little boy's body and mannerisms. He has become respectable over the years, even though he's still pretty much just a pretty face.His character in 'The Beach' is our protagonist, but he's also the antagonist because he was the one that gave away the map to more unwanted tourists wtf?!?!. So, we root for him, but he's the one that ended hippie paradise. This makes no sense at all, and is a fatal problem for the film.The film is also pretentious to a fault. We're meant to see these adventurous hippies is having achieved some ideal utopia. It doesn't work, to me being trapped on an island with these people would be the opposite of paradise.Where it devolves into a comedy is when Leo goes into the jungle and morphs into Tarzan. The laugh out loud moment comes when the drug dealers are chasing the poor tourist girl, and instead of helping her, Leo hisses at her like a cat. I laughed 20 years ago, and I still laugh in 2020. Too stupid to believe.Unless you like to laugh at bad movies that take themselves way too seriously (like me), then skip this one.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Entertaining but Uneven,"Although The Beach isn't a terrible film by any means, it still remains uneven, and often times, poorly written.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Underwritten,"Two great performances in this movie, by Leonardo DeCaprio and Robert Carlyle, and it has an interesting plot that could have worked better. In the commentary Boyle explains that he generally avoids back-story, which is undoubtedly a sound approach, especially in thrillers. But the drawback in this movie is that everything ends up in the same dimension. Nothing is in relief, nothing in the plot casts shadow or throws light. This happens and then that happens and for what reason and anticipating what end aren't very important. Basic storytelling starts with character X wanting something. Boyle's first movie, Shallow Grave, is such a fine movie because of how well that principle is put into effect. In that case, the thing wanted, i.e., the money, is basic and self-explanatory as a motivation.The characters in The Beach are drifters and pleasure-seekers to whom nothing seems like such a big deal. I have no idea how you can build a thriller around that, but one thing I know would have helped would have been to give the actors better-drawn characters to work with. Some pretty terrific actors, including Virginie Ledoyen, Patterson Joseph and above all Tilda Swinton, are wasted in underwritten roles here. They do interesting things from time to time, but they always fade almost immediately until they are brought forward again to serve the plot. The movie feels like a showpiece for DiCaprio (and, briefly, Carlyle), and his acting is remarkable, especially considering that the writing of his character is pretty unfocused too. I recommend this movie for his performance.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

It had the potential to be really excellent. The story is really unique, and intriguing. It's also quite scary - especially the start, in the scene with Daffy. It also had really good effects - the computer game bit freaked me out. Leonardo DiCaprio did a pretty good job in it. Especially in the part where he has to retrieve the map. Everyone will hate Sal, which means she's a good actress, because you're supposed to hate her. Overall it's a pretty good movie, and you should see it.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Underdeveloped but Fun,"I have not read the book. So forget that aspect.
Maybe the reason for not sharing characters' back stories is a way to say that you can be anyone on a vacation, or everyone starts fresh on a deserted island.But I personally prefer to hear about the lives of all key characters in a movie like this. Just have them explain in a conversation with each other. Then I would care more about them. But they didn't do this.I like to reminisce about being young and about adventures I had or wished I had. So I enjoyed living vicariously through our main character. Thailand is one of those places where you are likely to meet Europeans seeking adventure or release, because many live in cold, uptight societies. So I believed the fact that most of the beach people were from Europe.It is totally true that no matter where you travel, you bring yourself and your nature with you. There are some good lines in this film about that. Also that any grouping of people will include ""Alphas,"" ""Betas,"" and assorted misfits. At every job I've ever had, ever group trip I've ever taken, every school I've ever attended, there were always all those types, and they didn't get along.Something I read into the plot that we are not told, is that the leader woman may come from money. Maybe they don't just exist on money from selling pot. She probably has a trust fund. That may not be in the book. But it would make sense.I liked DiCaprio here, because he had that fresh, youthful loser guy vibe down perfectly. A guy who had nothing going for him, but was ready and eager to reinvent himself. He looked genuinely excited to be alive and experience this adventure, until it went bad.I totally believed the young French couple. They were perfectly cast. As were the beach dwellers. I also liked the device of using physical injury or illness as the threat to paradise.As for depth, we needed to hear more conversation about the nature of life. There is a good line in the final narration about what it means to find paradise. But I would have liked to hear some debates about morality. At least there was one somewhat Christian guy and one Catholic who shows some integrity.They should have cut the entire sequence of animation. It did not fit. It was like a separate movie. I like the idea of our character starting to lose it, and witnessing what he did, but minus the technical hijinks.Meanwhile the ending was fine for me. It made sense, and I loved the touch of having him reflect on it all at a café.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Film about weed and human nature.,"Essentially, 'The Beach' is a film about weed. Weed, marijuana, cannabis, hash...whatever you want to call it. Weed became the motivation for some of the characters.Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a free spirit always in search of adventure. In Bangkok, he meets and befriends a young French couple, Françoise and Étienne. He also meets Daffy, a guy so high on dope that everything he says might just as well have been a figment of his imagination, but when he produces a map to a secret, secluded beach, Richard's interest is tweaked.When Daffy is found dead the next day, Richard decides to tell Francoise and Etienne about the beach, and they join him in search of it. But almost immediately after arriving on the island where the beach is located, they are exposed to danger.The scenery is truly magnificent, allowing for stunning cinematography. The soundtrack is great, and there are cool visuals and lovely eye candy. At the core of everything, though, 'The Beach' is an interesting study of human behaviour. I enjoyed the movie for its depiction of human nature - both good and bad. No matter how perfect a place humanity finds, there will always be desire to ruin everything. Man always seem to have a need for MORE.There are a few very weird moments, and if you've seen the film you'll probably know which ones I'm talking about. It's as if the film completely lost it after the halfway mark, and some scenes even resembled a video game. Fortunately, the film does recover again, but for some the damage might have been done. As for me, I enjoyed 'The Beach', mainly for it's call to adventure and character study.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

To those who feel the need to belong somewhere. Without a doubt Leo gave the best performance of his young carrier in this film and truly managed to amaze me with his acting throughout. This film will excite you, it will terrify you, and most importantly it will connect with you as well as give you a motivation to live. I honestly feel like my life has changed after viewing this film, even 14 years after its release, ans it is certainly not to be missed.

A movie only for die-hard Leo fans,"The last time most moviegoers saw Leonardo DiCaprio, he was Jack, frozen to death next to a sinking Titanic and a shivering Rose. It took the currents two years to carry him to Thailand and wash him ashore on ""The Beach,"" which supposedly represents heaven or paradise. At the end of this film, two realizations dawn on the audience: Paradise doesn't exist. And the currents didn't do anyone a favor when defrosting DiCaprio and returning him to the screen.This time, ""Leo"" returns as Richard, an American who cuts all ties to explore the world and find adventure. Thailand seems the perfect place for him, with bustling streets, exotic beaches, and like-minded adventurous people. Initially, the film seems to pose the question of the purpose of traveling: Are we open-minded explorers, or just tourists looking for the familiar? And it comes up with an answer surprisingly critical of the nation that, thanks to McDonald's and Coke, has made it easy to settle for the familiar abroad. The adventurers in this movie come from England, France, or Scandinavia, rather than from America. Unfortunately, this challenge of the usual expectations of traveling already presents the only truly provoking thought.In Thailand, Richard dives into the life of the street and meets fellow adventurers. One of them, Daffy, worn out by drugs and sun, tells him a story about a mysterious beach on an unpopulated island. Robert Carlyle, as Daffy, is a perfect cast; his role appears hardly different from the villain in the last James Bond movie. Before he commits suicide, he provides Richard with a map of this secret island. After convincing a French couple, Etienne and Francoise, to join him, the three set out on a dangerous journey to the hidden place. Upon their arrival, they find a small community of adventurers fulfilling their own dreams of paradise. A set of rules regulate their everyday life, mainly stressing the importance of the secret of its existence; overpopulation would endanger their small world. Predictably, rules are broken, and the realization that heaven doesn't exist, and paradise can turn into a nightmare, is so trivial that it's hard to believe this provides the only message of ""The Beach.""The characters' preoccupation with the bright side of life stands out in the film. Beautiful nature (Thailand can expect a rise in tourists next summer), beautiful women (Virginie Ledoyen convinces as Kate Winslet's successor), and drug use make up the main part of the movie. At least the latter doesn't come as a surprise: director Danny Boyle is best known for his film ""Trainspotting."" The director's influence on ""The Beach"" remains, however, almost invisible, because it's ""Leo time"": DiCaprio's handprint is all over the movie. With confidential and superfluous addresses to the viewer, he draws him on his side, makes him a companion. Stealing a girlfriend, cheating, breaking the rules of the community, lying, and ultimately being responsible for the death of about half a dozen people makes for an impressive list of immoral achievements. Yet DiCaprio is cast as hero from beginning to end. The producers seemed to think that, just by being ""Leo,"" he would get away with it.Maybe the concept works for the huge teen fan base he has attracted since Titanic. A more mature audience, however, has to question the morality presented in ""The Beach,"" and wonder what else DiCaprio will try to get away with . Wherever he will be washed ashore in his next movie -  after ""The Beach,"" he won't be able to rely on past credits anymore.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Terrible waste of an excellent novel,"Alex Garland's brilliantly observed, if poorly finished, first novel is done no favours by this trite and hackneyed star vehicle for LdiC. Gratuitous love scenes, an APPALLING fantasy Game-Boy sequence and, good God, a happy ending where everyone goes home with happy memories of the time they spent on a desert island; this smacks more of The Blue Lagoon; Return to the Mediocre. None of the major events or characters of the novel are properly handled, few enough are even featured, as we watch Leo grin & grimace his way through his extended vacation. There's no tension, no threat of violence from within & without the group, no simmering discontent, no split and no violent denouement.

I couldn't disagree more, I thought Leo performance was pretty good.  He was funny at times, goofy, serious. Remember he is only in his early 20s and his best work is probably yet to come.

"lacking in concept, but can be watched for the adventure","Starts promising, but turns out to be something of a promising waste of time. It is cool when he arrives in Thailand, finds the map and they swim to the island, because of the suspense and all (though not enough of that either). However, the disappointing thing is that the to-be-expected alternative people on the island aren't alternative in any significant way (except their clothes and makeover), and lack any kind of interesting alternative ideas that their life there, one would expect, be based on. They just created a relatively quiet and private city away from the city, and even buy most of what they need from the big city.Anyways, I found DiCaprio's performance quite good, though his character was somewhat disoriented and finally kind of broke down psychologically as he got isolated and started getting high on shrooms. He kind of really whacked out.I would have still been happy to see the movie as a good adventure in beautiful environment, but that you can't fully enjoy either since the sight of the shark stricken people in its middle is more than very hard to take calmly, though the styling of it is i suppose what would be called professional.It is an OK movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Read the book!,"After having read the great book, I wanted to watch the film despite a lot of the bad word of mouth it had gotten. Still, I was disappointed. First of all, a worse casting than diCaprio as Richard can not be possible. I have nothing against diCaprio, but his prettyface is as misplaced as a black actor would have been starring Schindler's List. It doesn't work at all, especially since he still looks as he just came from a stylist after 2 months on the beach where even soap is a luxury item. But even in the beginning he doesn't come off as a seasoned backpacker at all - rather more like one of the tourist scum he claims to despise. Further, the change of personality that Richard goes through during the time on the beach do not come to life. How the director visualizes Richards madness in the end borders on parody. And the spots where the scripts deviates from the book tears apart the logic - basically a lot of details plus some romance and sex that seems to have been inserted because such a film needs romance and sex, but instead rids the plot of logic and coherence. And finally, turning Richard into an American is not a great idea either. Read the book - it is great. Or go travel. Or both. But don't rent the film, it is awful.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

"The film comes to engage and entertain well for most, but fails at crucial points in the composition of suspense, giving the idea that heaven was turning into a h*ll","The Beach is certainly one of the most controversial projects of filmmaker Danny Boyle and star Leonardo DiCaprio. The film oscillates between the traditional language of Boyle, but what we see is that the project is a grand experiment director.In a cheap hotel in Bangkok Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio) meets Françoise (Virgine Ledoyen) and Étienne (Guillaume Canet), a couple of Frenchmen. He also meets Daffy (Robert Carlyle), an older traveler marked by years of sun and drugs. So paranoid Richard Daffy tells the unlikely story of a secret island, a paradise on earth, the perfect beach without the presence of tourists. The next day, Richard finds a hand-drawn map of the island described by Daffy at your doorstep. He sees this as ""something different"", and so Richard will seek Daffy and learns that he committed suicide by slashing his wrists. Richard persuades Francoise and Etienne to join him on a trip following the map left with the intention of going to ""the beach"". No means of transport arriving by swimming up to this paradise, and after some dangers, provided by local farmers, come to dream destination and find a small community of travelers that, like them, he found ""the beach"" and live in secret. They receive welcome the group and the leader all in accordance with the rules of the leader Sal (Tilda Swinton)., And this part of the island paradise becomes their home, leaving behind the world they knew. But in reality this heaven on earth is not so perfect. Personal conflicts and jealousies create a violent rivalry and tragic events divide the community. Quite isolated and upset, Richard does not know what to do, because the dream has become a nightmare and paradise became hell. Now your only goal is to leave. But escape will not be easy because ""the beach"" is a secret place, some will defend to the death.The idea of a perfect and unique place that attracts these tourists and the price you pay for having omitted this secret from other people take the film to a plot full of adventure and suspense. Unlike many critics and filmgoers, The Beach has a young language, interesting, beautiful and with enough elements to attract especially teenagers. The usual script collaborator Boyle, John Hodge is based on the work of Alex Garland, and is divided into three parts. The first presents the protagonist and his solitary style, adventurous and even apathetic, knowing that path its travel partners and the person responsible for her present the myth of the most wonderful beach in the world. The second part shows the difficulties to reach the isolated spot where the island is located the group and the reception by the local community. But the end is centered in this community, that jealousy, rivalry and tragic events one sees split and run the risk of having placed his anonymity at risk. Therefore the structure of the script is already a bit different to start presenting the conflicts from the middle to the end of the film, which detracted from its beginning, leaving the work very still and dull.The biggest criticism of the film is even justified by some essential factors. As stated, the monotony which reigns in the first hour of the film is immense. From the moment visitors arrive on the island is such that conflicts begin and some suspenseful situations arise. But these situations do not have continuity and are inserted in a well spaced throughout the last hour of the film. The conflict, moreover, are explored as well loosely, because there is no time for them to be developed, not generating psychological density and involvement by the audience. But what is most disappointing is that the film was not explored as it could. It is a work with a lot of potential. After all, this is a utopian society in a heavenly place isolated from everything and all the troubled contemporary life that would have their major conflicts and internal disputes that may endanger the existence of the site. The idea is great, but has not reached its full potential.Under the interpretations there are considerations to make. After the great success of Titanic (1997) and starring in The Man in the Iron Mask (1998), Leonardo DiCaprio star production. The principle would be the role of the longtime partner of Boyle, Ewan McGregor, who for scheduling problems had to decline the invitation. DiCaprio was criticized by the apathy shown, in an even more adventurous and fearless character. During long it will be releasing more, but it really is the worst job of the actor's career, which at that time was still considered just a pretty face and not as a great actor who has proved from Gangs of New York (2001 ) of the master Martin Scorsese. Another great actress Tilda Swinton is wasted, which appears only in the latter half of the long and has no chance to deepen her character better. Another recurring actor in the work of Boyle's Robert Carlyle, who appears here only at one end at the beginning of the plot, being responsible for telling the island to Richard.Some scenes are unnecessary and even border on the ridiculous, especially that Richard, who is a video game player, running in the woods doing just a reference to a video game. The scene is anticlimactic and does not work. On the other hand, there are some nice scenes, like the kiss of Richard and Françoise to the sound of Porcelain, in a scene poetic and engaging.Britain's Danny Boyle, who had previously directed three classic low-budget film (Shallow Grave (1994), Trainspotting (1996) and A Life Less Ordinary (1997)) received harsh criticism with this work for the above reasons, but he presents us above all a beautiful movie. The cinematographer Darius Khondji is stunning, featuring one of the most idyllic places in the world on the beach surrounded by rocky walls called Phuket, and also the beach Ko Phi Phi Leh, both located in Thailand. The film exudes tranquility and feeling of actually being in a paradise. Interestingly, the region of the two beaches was devastated by tsunami in 2004, killing hundreds of thousands of people in Southeast Asia. Another highlight is the soundtrack with tracks such as ""All Saints' Pure Shores"", ""Moby"" of Porcelain, ""Sugar Ray"" of Spinning Away, ""Woozy"" from Faithless and ""Redemption Song"" written by Bob Marley.The film comes to engage and entertain well for most, but fails at crucial points in the composition of suspense, giving the idea that heaven was turning into a h*ll. There is by far the best work of Danny Boyle and DiCaprio, but it has its merits. Be the beautiful scenery and the beautiful French actress Virginie Ledoyen, worth watching The Beach.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bad story good acting,Kids story amazing acting as usual from leo and the cast were good too,7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Paradise lost,"I had a very strange experience with this...thing.I watched it late last night and thought it was pretty good, with pretty great acting, directing, and a fairly interesting story (but don't worry, even I wasn't unable to notice the weird choice of licensed songs and the introduction of the Swedes that felt like it could have come straight out of Borat), but after discussing it with some friends who didn't like it as much, I found that I couldn't really disagree with much of what they were saying.I realized that they were completely right about the film starting as a mystery, turning into a romantic comedy, and ending as something like Apocalypse Now or The Deer Hunter, and that nothing all that interesting really happened towards the middle, and how stupidly quickly the three main characters all become best friends.So while I didn't initially see it, I do have to admit that the tone is a bit all over the place, and the entire second act is a little flat. The first and third I might go as far as to call great, and Leo being nominated for the Worst Actor Razzie is just ridiculous, but it also could have certainly done with a tighter script, and a slightly more well-rounded protagonist, and then it could have genuinely been great.Maybe I just liked it more at first because it's dark by 4 pm every day at the moment, and I need something to long for in vain.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

What a nice pop video.,"Fantastic music, fantastic images. No real content, though, sadly enough.Leo's fans will love it, of course, particularly females, as he spends most of its time running around naked. The general theme does sound quite good: a bunch of ostracised people living their lives away from civilisation, simply because ""they can't bare it anymore"". A criticism towards today's society? Sort of reminds me of William Golding's Lord of the Flies, or even Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. Always this idea of an Island, a paradise, a false sense of loneliness, of independence.I must confess I overall liked the movie. I particularly enjoyed that conjunction of sometimes poetic, sometimes violent music and image. Congratulations to Moby, to Underworld, for such gorgeous themes, and to Danny Boyle, for putting it all together, even though sometimes we wish the movie had been more than just a nice pop video.I'm sure all the Yanni's and Vangelis' out there will love The Beach.

An original and stunning film !,"I really enjoyed this film! The action takes place in Thailand on a hidden island with incredible landscapes. The plot is very original and stunning.

The cast is very attractive with Leonardo Di Caprio and the others excellent actors who are absolutely convincing and believable. The music isn't unforgettable but stays listenable and reminds me to The See's Tooth at a sequence. It creates an effect very gripping.

A diabolical adaptation of Alex Garlands Novel,"Unlike the book, I found this film a no. 10 on the Sore Bum scale and couldn't wait for it to finish so I could leave the cinema and stretch my legs.The first half was pretty faithful to the book, that is until the main characters reached the Beach.  It was from this point the story took on a mind of its own and any similarities to the novel vanished. The absence of two major characters from the book didn't help either.I think anyone who has read the book with absolutely hate this film.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
A competent film version of an excellent book,"After the runaway success of Alex Garland's novel on which this film is based, it was only to be expected that people would come away disappointed. A few years on, though, it deserves a repeat viewing.This is a film for the MTV generation - quick cuts, frantic camerawork, unnatural lighting and camera angles, and a soundtrack from the likes of Leftfield, Moby, Underworld, Faithless and others. This makes it a very watchable film, but prevents the film's moral having any genuine weight in the 'Lord Of The Flies' or 'Apocalypse Now' sense.And comparisons to 'Lord Of The Flies' are justified. Not just in the superficial sense that a group of humans are on an island, shut off from the outside world; this is a story about the way people would behave in a state of nature (i.e. away from civilisation and the political institutions that accompany it), and as such reveals a great deal about our collective psyche. Sadly, a film of this length is inadequate for the purpose of fully exploring human nature to the extent that Garland did, but Danny Boyle relays the book's central messages without being overly heavy-handed.The central performances are solid, if nothing particularly memorable (with the exception of Robert Carlyle, who is always memorable), though I'm not too sure about Tilda Swinton and Lars Arentz-Hansen (Sal and Bugs), especially Arentz-Hansen. In his defense, his character is poorly written - a pale imitation of his counterpart in the novel. Virginie Ledoyen is great; we should see more of her. Please?Like 'Lord Of The Flies', this is a story in which the characters represent different aspects of human nature. Part of the reason that I like this film, despite its flaws, is that I can see bits of myself in each of the characters, and bits of them in me. In particular, I feel like I can identify with Richard, and I suspect a lot of people feel the same. He represents the man who rejects civilisation and its values without realising how much he depends on them; even when he finds paradise, he finds himself pretending that he's in a Vietnam film, or that he is the central character in a videogame. The irony is that by trying to show us that adventure isn't as glamourous as it seems, 'The Beach' makes adventure seem glamourous, just like all the 'war is hell' movies like Full Metal Jacket glamourize war.I guess escapism is in our nature, and stories like 'The Beach' only strengthen our desire to escape.

"Tisk, tisk.","""Oh my god everyone Leo has a new movie coming out.""  That is basically what happens when Leonardo DiCaprio's name is even uttered since becoming a teen heartthrob in 1997's Best Picture ""Titanic"".  Unfortunately people don't remember Leo's best work playing Johnny Depp's mentally challenged little brother Arnie, which earned him his only Oscar nomination, in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"".  His new film ""The Beach"" was the victim of mass hype hurting your opinion of the film before you even see it because you are just expecting something more than it is.Leo portrays Richard, a young traveler from America, who is looking to do more than just the usual tourist type activities.  Luckily his hotel room is next door to Daffy Duck's.  That is the alias of the next door neighbor, played by Robert Carlyle, who tells Richard about this ""perfect"" beach out in the pacific.  Daffy draws Richard a map and continues his own little descent into insanity.  Richard takes him up on the offer asking a young French couple, played by Virginie Ledoyen and Guillaume Canet, who also accept the offer.The young travelers go on their journey and find the beach, which is inhabited by a whole village of 20 somethings.  Richard and company think they are in paradise but as the tagline says ""innocence never lasts forever"".I'll leave the rest shot in the air because Richard goes on his own little surreal journey into madness, trying to fight what's real with what's not.The film was well directed by Trainspotting alumni Danny Boyle but the story itself is simply lacking.  The film as a whole was put together well with beautiful cinematography, courtesy of the Thailand filming locations, but unfortunately it just wasn't written or told very well.  Sometimes that just happens. I do have to say that I did enjoy the ""videogame"" scene with Richard tramping through the woods.All in all a well made film but lacking in story and plot.

Boyle's Beach,"Brilliantly shot in true Boyle style, reminiscent of Trainspotting, The Beach paints a relatively pleasant story until taking a dark turn.

The Beach is not for everyone,"I resisted seeing this movie from when it came out till now, almost 25 years later. I came across a copy of the DVD and thought it was one I should see as Leo has grown in my estimation as an actor.I read the reviews by others - some good, mostly bad - prior to viewing. But I watched with an open mind.Firstly, and positively, this movie has atmosphere. Even on DVD, you can feel yourself in the locale - a tribute to the director, Danny Boyle. Secondly, the action was engrossing. What happened actually interested me. There are a few very powerful scenes that are handled with utmost force. They gripped me.As to the characters, I was a lttle more ambivalent. Leo acts with his customary style and assurance, even when his character (Richard) is being very unsure of himself. For me, though, there were episodes when Richard's behaviour was offensive. Maybe people behave in strange ways when in a foreign (to them) and artificial environment. I won't say these episodes were unconvincing: just strange. Accepting that Richard wasn't always in control - we usually like leads to be in control - made the movie edgy and unpredictable. I liked that effect even if it was hard to watch sometimes. The movie threw up a lot of moral challenges, not all of which were handled well by the characters. In doing so, the movie highlights moral failings that are found everywhere in our world.I will watch this movie again and may have a different perspective. All I can say for sure is that Th Beach is a movie that makes an impact - the opposite of what I was expecting.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not your average trainspotting,"If we get to think about it, Danny Boyle's highest point as of 2000 was definitely the year 1996. Trainspotting was such a smash hit and a defining moment of the whole generation that it was just too tempting to try recreating its success. And, with a new emerging star of Leo DiCaprio, whose pretty face has been looking at us from the posters on the girl room walls ever since his Titanic days, the task seemed like a piece of cake: add some palms, beaches, spice it up with a French hottie and add some Robert Carlyle's brilliance as a cherry on top and a guarantee of the old-school spirit. Nothing could possibly go wrong. Or so they thought...Some spirit you can't deny this film indeed. Boyle's signature upbeat techno soundtrack, lush imagery and the whole sense of an acid trip do make this film look like its director's older child. And even though DiCaprio of 2000 is more of his annoying adolescent self than of that solid and mature figure he's become later, he is natural enough that you don't have to wish Ewan McGregor was back at his place.However, this time something's missing, some invisible but crucial glue that holds the story together and makes it evenly paced. Trainspotting was so amazing because it never dragged for a second. The Beach, on the other hand, feels much more jerky, combining the intensity-packed moments with outright droning or unnecessary filler. And while that depressing Scottish scenery could make even a filler look refreshingly novel, beaches of Thailand, although beautiful and calling, are more fulfilling for a tourist brochure than for a movie with a certain pretence of cultural weight.Still, it's not the patches of horrible dialogue and ridiculous continuity that bring this film down. Apparently Danny Boyle is better at building a story than dismantling it. And since The Beach' plot reaches its paradisaical climax only halfway through the movie, desecrating this paradise and bringing us back to the mortal world was a paramount task. And that's where it all went haywire, with lack of logic, consistency and sometimes even basic sanity. When an organic utopia falls apart it's never pretty, but one doesn't have to turn it into a travesty.All in all, The Beach is good at being a story of a spoilt kid's dream adventure going slightly sour. As for anything behind that pretty but shallow facade, like strong characters or a gritty story of their struggle for their ideals, don't hold your hopes too high.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Painfully underrated; an entertaining, engrossing movie","I see many negative reviews for ""The Beach"" and I really struggle to identify a justification for such an underrating.When I watched this film for the first time, I considered it to be an entertaining and original movie that, although retained a sense of solidity throughout, never truly shone; what puzzled me was the fact that I was glued to the screen throughout.However, upon my second viewing, I realised that this film carries a subtle depth that contributes strongly to its engrossing manner. Aside the strong acting and great script, a deep focus on characterisation ensures that the movie's protagonist and the changes he undergoes are incredibly engaging; in accordance with the fact that DiCaprio takes this lead, we are left with a character study as much as a movie. Furthermore, without giving anything away, the various parallels and paradoxes, both positive and negative, as well as the sense of underlying realism, ensure that, as a viewer, you feel compelled to truly take an interest in the ""The Beach"".Despite the strength of this film, what prevents it from being a true masterpiece is the fact that the pacing and atmospheric focus of ""The Beach"" is slightly too inconsistent and it can make the experience an overly peculiar one at times.Overall, it is difficult to explain why ""The Beach"" is such a compelling, intelligent and engrossing movie (especially without adding spoilers), however you just have to give it a go.

The plot is not very gripping, hardly any of the characters are fleshed out at all (because there are so many of them? the book certainly managed to include a lot more detail), and certain parts of the story are played upon too much at the expense of others (e.g. Daffy, who is dead, at the expense of Richard's relationships with Francoise, Sal, Keaty, etc). Watching it, I felt rather more analytical than usual, which probably demonstrates my lack of immersion in the film. The main problem for someone who has read the book is that so much is left out. Then I think of the people who haven't read it, and realise all that they are missing out on, because in just 2 hours they have seen something which may ruin their enjoyment of an excellent and thrilling novel.

Danny Boyle Gumbo,"What's disappointing about The Beach isn't the cinematography, which is great, or the plot, which is okay, or the acting, which is good.  It's the trailer.  Have you seen this thing?  It makes the movie out to be some fast-paced, thrill-a-minute, will they make it out alive fright-fest.  And it is absolutely none of those things.The movie is about American traveller named Richard.  Played very well by Leonardo DiCaprio, Richard stumbles across a map that reveals the location of some perfect little island, a paradise, if you will, and being an impetuous and free-willed young man, Richard decides to go there, accompanied by a young French couple that he has only just met.On this island are two things:  1) enough marjuana to keep all of Ann Arbor busy for a few months, and 2) drug dealers.  Barely escaping the drug dealers, our protagonists manage to find the other half of the island, which is populated by kind and reserved people who have decided to reject the outside world and create a perfect little society on this gorgeous island that virtually nobody else knows about.This community has a long-standing pact with the kind-hearted drug dealers. They co-exist in peace as long as they tell nobody else about the island. Everybody's happy.The plot doesn't have much going for it, other than it is a vehicle for some pretty heavy sociological/philosophical messages.  But despite the scanty use of conflict in the film, the movie as a whole is fairly entertaining. Directed by Danny Boyle, The Beach has a lot of the same sort of stuff that can be found in Boyle's other works.  It has the same gritty sound and speed as Trainspotting, but it also has the confusing and out-of-place weirdism of A Life Less Ordinary.  In fact, even though I give this movie a cozy two thumbs up, there are three problems with it that may bother more discriminating viewers.1. A forced love story.  Anyone who knows movies knows that all producers want some sort of love interest in their movie.  It gets the attention of the female viewership.  In many cases, this is pulled off without a hitch. In the case of The Beach, it is almost as if they made the entire movie and then, as a second-thought, realized they needed some kissin', and so they dumped in a horribly contrived and emotionally weak romance between Leo and the young French lady. 2. An unnecessary soul-quest, a la Jim Morrison in Oliver Stone's The Doors. At some point, Leo goes crazy for fifteen or twenty minutes as he wanders about the jungle.  This has absolutely no bearing on the rest of the film. It's like a commercial for insanity. 3. The final moral of the movie is imparted by the kindhearted ring-leader of the drug dealers, who doesn't just vocalize the moral, but delivers it Solomon-style: with this obscure and insightful test of the hidden resort leader's faith.  Although this is plausible in Danny Boyle's world, I doubt the drug dealer's would have imparted anything to the head-strong island citizens other than a volley of bullets.  But, then again, I'm not an expert on drug dealers.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Book Isn't THAT Much Better...,"THE BEACH (3+ outta 5 stars) Most people who are familiar with the book deride this movie as if it was a crime of the highest magnitude. Well, having read the book and not being overly fond of it (it was a good, light read and nothing more) I judge the movie to be a fine adaptation. Sure, they had to chop out some characters and situations and speed things along because it is only a 2 hour movie... but I think what they kept in is reasonably entertaining. The plot, dialogue and acting are all up to par. The movie as a whole may not be up there with ""Trainspotting"" or ""28 Days Later""... but as a ""star vehicle"" for rising young actor Leonardo DiCaprio it does the job... and the result isn't something that he should be overly embarrassed about as it keeps popping up in his resume. A young, pretentious American goes abroad to experience life as regular tourists seldom do. He hears of a mysterious island that is supposedly the closest thing to paradise on Earth.. but once he gets there he learns that people and paradise don't mix well together.

But this weird, crazy movie grew on me as time went on.The Beach is perhaps the most ""2000"" movie around. It's definitely a product of its time. It feels stuck in some kind of time warp, which is perhaps fitting given the atmosphere on ""the island"".There's a lot going on here and it keeps moving forward at a fast pace - craziness notwithstanding. Leo DiCaprio comes across pretty damn irritating at times, but delivers a strong performance regardless.It's an unbelievably cheesy and clunky film. There's a lot of cringe taking place, but then young 20-somethings trying to 'find themselves' in a tropical paradise couldn't be anything else but.This film is riddled with secrets and questionable morals. Despite its cheesy delivery, it somehow gets you thinking about deeper things in life. I liked how this ""travel"" film descends into something more closely resembling a Wicker Man like cult. Tilda Swinton is the stuff of nightmares.There are some memorable scenes - among them a video game sequence and graphic aftermath of a shark attack. It all turns into a bit of a fever dream. The Beach is far from perfect but it entertained me and made me want to read the source material.Probably a must-watch for DiCaprio fans or those wanting to re-live the late 90s/early 2000s. The soundtrack will be stuck in my head for days.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The journey is more exciting than the destination,"I really enjoyed the first 40 or so minutes of ""The Beach."" Richard, Francoise and Etienne's journey to The Beach is full of fun, adventure and romance. Unfortunately, guess what happens about a third of the way into this movie? They find The Beach! And we quickly realize that, as is often the case, the journey was far more exciting than the destination.Once at The Beach we find too many characters with too little to do. And while the movie focuses heavily upon Richard (Leo, of course) the other characters are largely forgotten. Even Francoise (played by the lovely Virginie Ledoyen), who is so vital to the first half of this movie, is largely forgotten in the second half.The main failing of ""The Beach"" can be summed up by the character of Sal, the leader of The Beach. Without giving away the climatic moment of the movie, Sal becomes the pivotal character in that climax. However, we have learned so little about her up to that point that we simply have no emotional attachment to her character. The climax which should have been a ""Wow!"" is instead a ""Ho-hum.""I suppose there are attempts here to make some political and social comments in regard to this utopia the characters have found, but I'm afraid this ain't no ""Lord of the Flies."" I wish the makers of this movie would start over from the top again. This time, have Richard and his friends keep searching, maybe come close, but never actually find The Beach.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Disappointing, pretentious cinema","After Danny Boyle's meteoric directorial success with Trainspotting, the movie world eagerly anticipated his next cinema effort. The British Film Institute ranked Trainspotting 10th on its list of greatest British films of the 20th century! However, The Beach turned out to be a major disappointment. Leonardo DiCaprio, an excellent actor, is prettier than a prom date. However, his presence in the film is wasted. The Beach is a shallow and pretentious film that takes itself way too seriously.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good but some lost potential,"Because Leonardo Di Caprio is such a huge star and cult figure, some people have begun to dismiss his work and underrate his abilities. Naturally films like "" Iron Mask "" don't help, but there is definately something in him that gives him the classic "" watchable "" attributes made famous by legends such as Jimmy Stewart and Clint Eastwood. No I am not comparing Leo to them , it's just an example. This movie by Danny Boyle (if you haven't seen his best effort Shallow Grave you should) is curiously uneasy from the start as we see Di Caprio arriving in Thailand alone and looking for adventure. The plot keeps moving along well enough, although it does take a little too long to get to the island. Also, nitpicking here, the island seems to me to be a little too convenient to get to.....I mean it's visible by binoculars from a tourist beach ( come on ! ) Once there the characters that have lived on the island, peaceably we learn with some ruthless drug-farmers, for six years , simply welcome the three newcomers with open arms. Another slightly annoying trait among the ""dwellers"" is they all seemto be refugees from the eighties, smurky, mid thirty types fed up with the corporate world and universally yearning for nature. Aside from this though, Leonardo and the gorgeous Virginie Ledoyen hold our interest. The sense of comradeship only begins to deal with it's dark side, which would have really made the sense of danger and mystery more alluring, but we do see our hero descend into a self-imposed nightmare when he is strangely exiled by the leader of the group. In the end he comes to terms with what's going on when more strangers arrive and meet their fate at the hands of the farmers..... but the conclusion is somewhat unsatisfying . Director Boyle could have made the finale much more gripping and tense but instead lets us down easily, diminishing the initial menace the concept of the Beach wants to emit. Overall though, I would recommend this movie. If you wonder at Di Caprio and what all the fuss is about ........see him in What's Eating Gilbert Grape . Js",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Good for a lazy afternoon but don't get too excited,"Review: The Beach (movie)In nutshell The Beach is a random Hollywood movie, which could be worthwhile to pass the time if you don't have anything better to do, as my friends and I didn't. The yummy popcorn was far more gripping than the storyline (but don't give up on my review now. there is good stuff at the end!).And why I got such letdown by it? Manly cause most of the story is I meanshallow and also too easily predictable. I also reckon that the author focused too much on Leonardo (who I think is a good actor), remaining too little space to the other good guys.However, what I found really really breathtaking was the incredible set. The pristine island in Thailand was a stunning and perfect place for the hippie community, being this by far the best characteristic of the movie, therefore strongly inspiring myself to visit this paradise.So, you should also have a go and see if you agree with me. It could be as well a good inspiration for those who are fed up with their lifestyles and are craving a bit of adventure! Cheers.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
A clever story that has been mistreated and unfulfilled.,"Here it is girls, Leo's latest movie!  That's about the only reason anyone would see this movie.  I was bored and wanted something to do, and despite the fact that DiCaprio can make millions merely because of his ""heartthrob"" status quo, he's not a bad actor.  In fact, he's quite good, and he does a good job with this film.  The story is quite original, based on the novel by Alex Garland, about a secret island that is paradise.  The photography is great, with sweeping visions of the island, the ocean, and even the segments with ""excess imagery"" look good.  However, I couldn't help but be disappointed at how the material was treated and pulled off.  Some of the scenes waste time, while still others that are intended to be serious come across as downright laughable(aka. the scene where a digitized DiCaprio runs through a video game environment).  I also didn't like the fact that much of the story didn't come across, thanks to the over-abundant use of excess imagery.  Plus, Leonardo's character suddenly and drastically changes into some sort of ""more than a man or animal"" personality.  I still thought the source material was clever and original, but it was mistreated and misused here.  I think that a director like Terrence Malick would've faired better, not that director Danny Boyle is a bad director.  I just don't think that he's meant to direct a film like this.  As for Leo, he does what he can with a nearly complete script and I wonder how he feels about the scene where he's digitized in a video game environment.  All I know is that everyone in the theater laughed out loud at it.",,Anonymous,Romance
Exceptional First 1/2 hour; Loses it's Focus in Middle,"Being a big Danny Boyle fan, I was a little disappoiinted by ""The Beach."" However, I must say the first 1/2 hour was as good as any work he has done in the past. The beginning let's you get to know and identify with Richard (Leonardo Dicaprio) a lost, uncomfortable American traveler, who, like so many is anxious to try something ""new."" The script by the always dependable John Hodge captures Richard's mood perfectly. Another fantastic element of ""The Beach"" is Robert Carlyle's appearence as Daffy, a spontaneous and exciting character who remains the real center of Richard's state of mind throughout his wild stay on the beach.After the first hour, however, the film begins to stumble as Richard's mood begins to shift and this transition simply feels too rushed. Dicaprio turns in a good performance, however the other characters remain rather flat. Even though the film is strictly about Richard and what he represents, they could have built more on his relationship with Etienne (Guillame Canet) and especially Francoise, (Virginie Ledoyen) not to mention the others on the beach. The film is also tremendously visual, as Boyle continues to make the settings just as large a part of the story as his characters.By the end the themes feel complete,(They are reminiscent of some in ""Fight Club"" in an odd way) however the story comes up short.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Different than the book, same problems as the book","Read the book over the summer, really liked it in a Fight Club kind of way. Post gen-X stereotype stories that actually speak to me and my frustrations. But I thought the book got muddled near the end, especially in the return of Daffy to the proceedings. That was even more extreme in the movie. As soon as Richard goes crazy, Boyle went for a schizophrenic non-linear extended montage, all of which took away from the rest of the film. If insanity was presented as matter of factly as paradise was, with composed scenes, instead of images, it would have been more powerful as well as more satisfying. Dicaprio, as usual, was top notch.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Interesting...for lack of a better word,"I went into watching this film with no expectations whatsoever (sometimes the best way to watch a film) but was left with a feeling of unfulfillment. I didn't realize this was from the same director that guided Shallow Grave and Trainspotting to two of the best films I've ever seen, I think he could have done better.  Still, the acting was good, the format and cinematography great.  The second shark scene was terrifying and the repercussions afterwards equally disturbing.  Unlike others, I liked the video game immersion scene but I get the impression the book did a better job in explaining his infatuation with video games.  I was left shaking my head of Richard's final emotion when reminiscing.  I'd have the complete opposite reaction. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

This unique experience from death to the impact of loneliness. From the person who created train spotting you are in for a real treat.

Give this film a chance,"This is probably a case where reading the book first is a distinct advantage in understanding some of what has been harshly described as ""incomprehensible"" events. This story is a parable, on many levels, and as such, is ripe with thought provoking, not to mention conversation provoking, material.  Isn't this one of the pleasures of seeing a film - the discussion it can foster?  I think many factors have influenced the critics: The desire for iconoclasm where Leo is concerned (many reviews editorialize with subjective comments about him);  the disappointment that the film is ""dark"" and not noble enough; and the fact that screenwriters have to make difficult choices; e.g., if the Vietnam/video game fascination had been more of a thread running throughout the film, as in the book, then perhaps some of Richard's behaviors would not have been perceived as ""incomprehensible"". In short, I think many things in this film were misunderstood.  I enjoyed this film on many levels, but maybe more so because I had read the book.  My husband thought it was ""great"".  I enjoyed the prerequisite ""Danny Boyle"" inventions which added an element of quirkiness.  (I also resent the sense that we have to practically apologize for liking this film!)  Richard's character is complex - needy, selfish, sensitive, sometimes cold...this translates as interesting and Leo portrayed him artfully.  Also, in a stroke of genius, the character of Sal was made even more interesting than in the book.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Average - not one of Boyle's best,It's just ok. Not terrible by any stretch of the imagination but no masterpiece either. DiCaprio is as strong as ever (and manages to look younger than he does in Titanic despite it being 3 years after) and the classic Danny Boyle trippyness makes its way through.

The movie may have dope in it but it is more than just about dope heads,"I have read some reviews about this movie which bashed the movie for being just about dopeheads on island.  Frankly, that is just not the case (though it did cause me to wait a few more days before I actually saw it.)  The movie is fairly good and deserves a rating a lot higher than the 4.2 it was at.  DiCaprio as ""Richard"" was perfect for his role, I mean who could forget the scene in the jungle where his insanity culminated in him freaking out the running girl by staring at her and making a sound like a snake. Another great shot was the video game sequence, occurring as Richard got bored and began running through the jungle was just priceless.  Anyways the thing that made the movie for me was Richard's descent into madness and his strange friendship with daffy. Now I must admit there was some cheesiness in the movie, but it seemed all to fit into place and was put there on purpose. I don't think this movie was as good as Trainspotting however it definitely in my books deserves a 8/10, if you don't believe me, then just rent it when it comes out either way its worth the money in my opinion.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Good film, but disappoints in the end","The locations were incredible and this lifts the movie to at least 3 extra points. The story though froze in deep boredom once they actually reached the camp. Leo and the other actors were terrific and the direction was very good, but the story was terrible. I didn't like the book either. I think the main reason is the center piece - the compound of people. It could have really popped with characters we've never seen before - instead of utopia, it was a gripe session. More should have been made on the goals of the group and destructive forces surrounding it. Overall, great film for location, poor film for story.

"One of the best movies I'd never heard of. And no, it's not because DiCaprio is the lead actor here.","He did it again. Leonardo DiCaprio once again starred in a movie that resonated with me on so many levels. Does he even have a bad movie? It's been a long time since I watched a film with him, so naturally I completely forgot how good... no, good isn't the right word here. How unique Leo's performance is. He's like head and shoulders above everyone else. I can't put my finger at exactly what makes his acting so special, but there's something intangibly charming about him, something that makes him unbeliebavly relatable, as if he's your good old friend who became a movie star. Not only that, the character he plays in this film is also relatable on his own. From the first monologue and to the last line, everything Richard thought or did almost 100% corresponded with what I would have thought or done. Perhaps, and quite probably that's the case, I'm more than biased here because, believe it or not, I have a nephew who happened to look exactly like him! ""Duh, no wonder you find DiCaprio so relatable"" you might say and would be 100% right. So, because of this special place he occupies in my heart I tend to rate the movies he takes part in higher than I would otherwise, but I'm not sure that's the case here.Even on its own ""The Beach"" (movie about which I hadn't heard until yesterday) presents itself as a great movie with an intriguing plot and exciting action. Again, I'm also biased towards the idea of escaping the society and finding my own group of people on some isolated island in the middle of nowhere. Even the love triangle is exactly the same I happened to find myself in back in my youth. Sometimes I'm taken back by how movies made decades ago manage to tell stories which will happen to me years later. So yeah, I'm kind of biased towards this film no matter how I look at it, so take my rating with a grain of salt.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

0/10,"How can someone make `The beach' after having directed `Trainspotting' ? How can someone make such a disastrous film with so great actors as Leonardo Di Caprio and Guillaume Canet ? There's no story, no message, no atmosphere, no sensible dialogues, no beauty, no logic, no soul, not the least trace of intelligence in this film. Moreover I'm not used to being moved by blood or violence in movies but here it was really unhealthy and made me feel sick and uneasy because they were completely gratuitous. I really watch lots of different films and even when they are not very interesting I never feel like leaving . That time I had to cling to my seat not to run away. Anyway I have at least had the great joy of hearing the most wonderful quote of this new millenium. Just picture yourself as a French boy swimming across the sea with your girlfriend and a new American pal.There's about one mile behind you, and one before. Of course, you suddenly feel like making a good joke. You pretend  a shark is attacking the girl. Of course, when he realizes you're just teasing him he's furious.Of course, he yells and tells you that's if that is French humour it's not a wonder French cinema can not be exported (?!!). Can you imagine the scene ? What would you answer if you were that French boy ? No idea ? Here it is : `What about Molière ?'. I couldn't stop laughing and I still would if I wasn't so disappointed. I like Guillaume Canet very much and I promise he's a very good actor. It is  so bad he should start his international career in such a bad movie.

The voice over was definitely taken from Fight Club, as was the ""Brad Pitt"" style and look, but DiCaprio is no Pitt and no Norton either, and the voice over gets pretty annoying quite soon. Not even to mention the contents. Or the content of the entire movie, for crying out loud. Don't even get me started here, because it's loaded with sheer nonsense and stupidity.

"Unique, flawed but  fantastic.","Danny Boyle has flown from B list director to household name in recent months after the runaway success of his latest movie, Slumdog Millionaire, but a lot of his earlier work received little or no recognition. The Beach is a perfect example of this, but it is interesting to see the development of his directorial skills. The seeds were obviously sown long before they flourished to Oscar winning standards, and the cinematography is glorious.It is easy to see why IMDb has a low average rating for this movie. It is a little scatterbrain and certain plot points are left unexplained, leaving it feeling a little incoherent. Also, there is one particular sequence to do with the main character Richard, superbly portrayed by a comfortable DiCaprio, is isolated and begins to lose his marbles. This is very odd few minutes, baring very little relevance to the overall plot and it somewhat breaks flow.These gripes aside, the movie is an extremely interesting watch, for several reasons. Despite having all the hallmarks of a Boyle film, the cinematography is unique. It bares a similarity to Trainspotting, in that the main character is our narrator, but the strange mixture of intrigue, romance and adventure is certainly refreshing. Where the movie really excels however is its exploration of some little explored concepts.The idea of isolation in paradise, and the selfishness of human kind is explored in detail, with the private colony's leader, Sal (Tilda Swinton) being the personification of this concept. Robert Carlyle makes fleeting appearances as Daffy, a crazed former resident, disgusted by the ""cancerous"" human race. Are there elements of environmentalism in to be picked up on? Overall i thoroughly enjoyed the movie. The roots of Boyle's recent genius show sparks of the brilliance to come and the sheer uniqueness on show will be endearing to any regular film watcher. Sure it has its problems but what films don't? With a little patience and trust in the director you may just find yourself enthralled.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

I didn't know what to expect going into this film, hadn't seen Leo on screen for a couple of years since Titanic. But I went into it with an open mind, and by the end of it, my buddy and I were quite impressed.

The acting was really well done too, and some of you may not like the narrative voice over, but I enjoyed it.

Dork Beach,"""Dork Beach"" wold have been the perfect title for this movie. A dork, by definition is a polar opposite of a nerd, someone so afraid of being uncool that every decision is based upon what other people think, which of course makes them the most uncool of characters. This movie centers on characters that would fit right in with Barney Fife and Ted Baxter. A young guy, who we learn later is the dork of dorks, has a map to a supposed Paradise on an Asian island, and he goes there with a Frenchman and the Frenchman's girlfriend. The Frenchmand, by the way is one of the only two characters with an IQ over 10. The other one is an unsavory sort who warns the dorks (an unheeded warning) that just because the super dork killed a five foot shark, don't take his goofy babble, about being one with nature and commanding all sharkdom, seriously. The three young people take a high dive into water they don't know the depth of. In real life a best case scenario would be instant death, but more likely hitting a rock, being paralyzed, and dying in anguish. This reason alone would make this movie unwatchable. Before that, they go bananas over a marijuana field in such a way that you see many people do, the kind of people who worship Cheeck and Chong, the kind you never really believe are that excited, but merely hide their true emotions with goofy babble. Then they find the field is guarded by gun toting locals. After the dive they come across some of the ugliest people you ever saw. Just physically repulsive. Island life does not show well on most Caucasians. The ugliest woman in the world is the leader. She's almost as mean as she is ugly. She has no leadership qualities, no charisma, nothing. Yet people attack on her command. The trio isn't there twenty seconds before the rut gut ugly woman tells them they can't leave. Of course, that is kidnapping, and an older guy would immediately slit her throat and the throats of everyone else who kept him from leaving, because this place is clearly some kind of Hell, and there is no saving grace to it. None! No appeal at all, unless you were to run off the dorks. Its hard to imagine even kids accepting this, but maybe that's the way the filthy rich spoiled types think. And these are all filthy rich spoiled types, richer than anyone you probably ever met. (They had the money to gallivant across the globe nonchalantly.) One of the trio thinks he is forced to make love to Miss Super Ugly, and you'd feel sorry for him if it wasn't for the fact that her blackmail didn't make sense. Add to this the fact that the marijuana growers know this group of pompous pot smokers is there smoking up their profits, and are undoubtedly thinking of a way to control the business for themselves, and you have a laughable scenario. They might let some vagabonds stay there, or some poor locals, or some retired people, or anyone who has no interest in the marijuana. But to believe they'd let the people most likely to snitch, crowd them out, and take over their business, is impossible to believe under any circumstances. These dorks would have been eliminated from the game of life two seconds after they were discovered. The only saving grace is that the movie does show that the kids are dorks, and the place is a Hell.

Probably one of my HBO diamonds in the rough films,"I did not have high hopes for this film. Coming off of the Titanic, Leonardo DiCaprio was typecast as a teen heartthrob and everything about this film's marketing screamed that. I must have been watching something on HBO like a TV show and decided to watch this just to see how long I could put up with it. The first thing you realize, around the scene with Daffy, is that this definitely wasn't a teen movie. It's a very deep, complex film with a great story, a coming of age film that's...very realistic. I think after some years in college, I started to understand exactly the type of people who were on the island, because I went to college with a lot of people like that. The movie basically is a gigantic criticism of the sort of affluent trustafarians who backpack and go around the world frolicking and partying. The trustafarians are living in a bubble away from the natives, who are struggling to support their families. One scene in particular points out who the real bad guys in the movie were, and it's probably one of the most depressing in the history of film.It's hard for me to get people to take me seriously to watch this film. Many saw the marketing for the film when it was released, the movie posters and won't give it a chance. It probably is one of my Top Ten movies, simply because of the many messages of the film. Many of Danny Boyle and Alex Garland's early works are exceptional like this movie. Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Could there anything worth watching this movie for...,"Seeing Leonardo DiCaprio without a shirt. That's about it. He does make a nice piece of eye candy.The rest of the movie is a disturbing piece of utter rubbish. I watched the first two Blade movies before I watched this. I don't know - maybe I'd reached my quota of senseless violence for the day, but whatever happened that movie set me on an edge and it wasn't a good one.If you haven't seen this movie yet, don't bother. It missed any message it was trying to convey, which might have still been all right, but it lacked any real plot or characterisation.I haven't read the book, which is probably a pity, because it is supposed to be better, but I don't have the stomach to now.It was just *Lord of the Flies* all over again, but with people who should have been old enough and smart enough to know better.

A great adaptation of Alex Garland's best seller. A thrill ride to the end!,"The beach is a luminous voyage into a paradise we all dream about but never find. It is a visual feast for the eyes that is incomparable in its beauty to any other film in recent history.The beginning grabs you right away. Snake blood is on the menu, and Daffy is lurking behind the mosquito netting, waiting to send Richard on a trip he will never forget.The whole scene with Daffy was extremely well done. Carlysle was perfection! And Richard's little comedic nuances were hilarious....The cinematography was also splendid, and the underwater shots took my breath away. The pumping soundtrack was fantastic, so well suited to the story.Leonardo played Richard just as I imagined he would be like in the book - a cocky know it all, manipulative, funny, charismatic, and then frighteningly mad. The eyes told the story. He gave Richard an edge that in some ways made him sympathetic, I thought.The analogies of blood and water are interesting in the darker parts of the movie at the end. I found it fascinating to watch Richard in his madness, and then in his desperation after he was shocked back to reality and cleansed by the pure clean waterfall.The shocking twist at the end was just right. It gave us just what Boyle said it would give us - the tension and suspense excluding the blood and gore.I loved the followup ending because it was so true to the book. It gave us exactly the scene that we see in the last paragraph of the novel by Garland - he still hears from Keaty, he still thinks of Francoise, but Richard's expression told the story -  you could see his ""memory"" of the lessons he learned...the innocence he lost...are still vivid in his mind.I thought the middle was edited poorly, and had no flow. The love triangle was not developed enough to make it worth while, but the fantastic first and last acts more than made up for it's middle act flaws! I thought the video sequence was a blast - it went along so well with the reasons why Richard's brain was so muddled: brought home the idea that Richard has no experience to draw on but his video game tactics when confronted with problems - it is his only background when making tough decisions about the problems he is now encountering....The acting was fabulous from the supporting cast to Leonardo's brilliant performance. I loved Patterson Joseph as Keaty, and Guillame was so sweet as Etienne, Virginie has a natural screen presence and beauty that is so refreshing next to so many of those ""fake"" Hollywood actresses we are subjected to now, and Carlysle as usual was perfect in his madness. Tilda Swinton's Sal was everything I had imagined in the book, and I felt the twist in the relationship between she and Rich really did add something to the story that was missing in the book.....it gave Bugs a substantial reason to hate Rich, something the book never did.Leonardo took us through this journey with amazing ease and honesty. Seeing him meeting challenge after challenge in this role with such accurate and precise brilliance makes me realise again what a gift he is. Paradise really only exists inside of one's soul..a soul at peace. Richard discovered that through his experience on The Beach, and boy, was it a trip!I give the movie 4 of 5 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
It sucked cheese  a movie for film students or DiCaprio groupies,"I would only suggest you watch this film if you want to study large budget failures or just think Leonardo DiCaprio poops roses.The only thing this film has going for it is the photography, at times it's breath taking but beyond that the dialog is bizarre and disjointed and the acting, specially DiCaprio's  is substandard. The stylized fantasy `departures' are often laughably bad.This film was so full of itself, that there wasn't room for the audience, as though we should be in awe of the greatness being presented. Pleeeeease.Quite frankly, `The Beach' doesn't deserve any more time spent explaining why it should seen when GREAT films like Angela's Ashes sit collecting dust on the rental shelf.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great film,"Film is so much better that a 6 rating. Leo in his prime PHWOAH!! The 3 leads are great all the actors a great the cinematography and music together excellent. My favourite gotta be the one with Richard and francoise. But under paradise we are also given a eye into the cruelty of human nature. The film delves over so many levels. It is very relatable beautiful, scary, bleak and sad. With a conclusion to keep moving forward & leave what turns bad. Tilda swinton & her boyfriend are truly creepy. She's nauseating as a kind of molester. And a harsh and ruling character. Always a great actress though. But she does get the meanest characters lol.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
I give this top adventure 10/10. A definite 'must see',"I give this excellent film 10/10 because its exciting, exhilarating and enjoyable from start to finish. In a lot of films, you can tell what is about to happen next. But The Beach is very unpredictable all the way through. This adrenaline-drenched movie is full of twists and turns and keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Richard, a young back-packer desperately searching for an escape from the stress and strain of life. He embarks on an adventure to find the ideal paradise far away where no one has ever ventured. Somewhere only very few know of........Will he succeed? Is there such a place? However, he discovers some things are blessings from Hell............DiCaprio shows off his great talent (and body!!!) exceptionally well in this film. His believable acting makes you even more into' the movie. No one could suit the part better.The film is set in the superb country of Thailand, the main location a beautiful island off the coastline. This is Hollywood's idea of an ideal paradise, and stated in travel brochures as one of the few places on earth to be described as 'paradise'. The wonderful locations in The Beach lets your imagination run wild with the possibility of being there. The strange thing is that it's real. This is why the film influences people to follow the footsteps of Richard, and travel around the world not only to Thailand, but to search for their own paradise.The Beach also has a great sound track, including the best-selling single of 2000, Pure Shores, by All Saints.This is a great adaptation of Alex Garland's best-selling novel. It is certainly one of the best films I've seen and the best movie of 2000. I recommend you seeing it. Thanks for reading my review!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
How low can it get?,"Oh no.  If there was ever a film that wasted a directors capabilities then this is it.  Boyle's previous works have been at least entertaining, but this (I hope) will be his worst ever film.  Visually the film is breathtaking, with the beach itself looking every bit as idyllic as it should, and the acting is excellent throughout.  Unfortunately there is a problem - everything else.  The plot is as gripping as lard, the characters, while excellently portrayed, are all miserable lowlifes.  DeCaprio's character particularly is a sniveling uncompassionate backstabber, which was a shame because it's the first time I've actually been impressed with his performance. All in all - Tragic.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Forget the snotty reviews, it's good!","Well, I feel like a freak of nature but I really like this film. Despite overwhelmingly bad reviews from most, this film just takes me away to another place and I really did enjoy it. Some people just really need to lighten up.This film brought out a deep sense of longing in me about my travels and about that search for the ultimate paradise. I found the young people in the backpacker colony on the Beach to actually very similar in looks and attitude to many young backpackers abroad. I also found the sharp contrasts between the Beach and the town on the mainland to be very well done and very true about young westerners in Thailand.The Beach was different, it was exotic. The film didn't end neatly, and that brings up all sorts of ideas about whether or not such a utopia could exist without human greed destroying it. Tilda Swinton did a superb job as Sal, the colony's leader. And Leo Di Caprio was good too as a cocky young American guy looking for a good time but getting in over his head. By the end of the movie, when he's back in the West looking back at that secret place, it was really sad. The constrasts were such so well done...I liked The Beach a lot, and I'll say it proud!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
a real backpackers POV...,"Alex Garlands book was first published in 1995, the same year I set out with my future husband on a 2 year round the world backpacking trip, which was a profound & not altogether pleasent expierence. I got ameobic dysentry in Kathmandu, slipped & smashed my head open on a wet toilet floor in Bombay (now Mumbi) & on a bus journey, had a head on collision with a 10 ton truck on the side of a mountain near the Tibetan border, where I literally saw the words ""Game Over"" pop up in my eyes! But I also learned that backpackers of my era & the time frame of the Beach (1990's) were not very nice people.. This (by accident or by design) certainly comes across in The Beach!The characters in the Beach (in particular Richard) are the most obnoxious, self centered, ego driven bunch of oddballs ever to grace any film. However Tilda Swinton as creepily unhinged leader Sal, gives an amazing performance, making this movie worth a watch. Di Caprio, on the other hand, is wooden, & very unrelatable as Richard. His occasional over acting is also irritating. The basic screenplay is equally unconvincing (I have seen it done it & bought the t shirt) as backpackers would never congregate with other backpackers in a secret commune. The reason is that each backpacker of my time liked to think their own expierence is unique, special, & never been done before. Real backpackers are ""travel snobs"" who are loath to admit that they cannot live without their western creature comforts, which is only breifly explored in the Beach. Backpackers will congregate in places where those western creature comforts are catered for, like Kho San Road in Bangkok. Their food is chips (fries) burgers & hot dogs, their entertainment is Hollywood movies, yet they dress in outlandish ""local"" clothes like Thai fishermans pants, badly tied sarongs & often looked like whacky clowns in tie dye! They have a parchent to eat their evening meals dressed only in beachwear & women sunbath topless with absolute no regard that this activity in Asia is considered offensive to the local culture. So I can well understand just why the Beach has such obnoxious characters, as it's not far from the truth. But a lot of this film remains unconvincing, like swimming in the open ocean in a straight line? No you would be carried by the current & miss the island entirely! Anyway the Beach ticks on quite nicely until it literally looses the plot in the second half of the film where Richard goes loopy & becomes Rambo & Super Mario at the same time. It is at this point, I quite frankly loose interest in this movie. It makes no sense, adds nothing to the plot & appears to be simply inserted to flesh out the film to an acceptable length of a movie.Well i anyone is looking for a taste into what backpacking was like in the 90's, this movie almost takes you there...almost. But us backpackers did not live in communes & never would!",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Underrated gem. Definitely worth watching at least once.,"This movie's reviews are way too low. It does sometimes have weak writing and the plot may seem a little random at times, but the point is that at the beginning of the film, Richard is meant to be a blank slate representing a common type of young adult in the millennial generation, and how he changes as a character could potentially happen to anyone in the same scenario.The big thing that The Beach gets right is compelling character arcs and decisons. It's interesting to see how stumbling upon a paridise can change people in major ways. This is especially evident in our main character, but side characters such as Sal, Etienne, and the Beach residents as a group with how they react to hardship and tragedy in a place where there hardly is any. They do things that you will not agree with, making you turn your brain on and then hopefully realize how having no troubles in life makes anyone bad at dealing with them, and that excessive stimulation and happiness can corrupt the mind, creating an insatiable craving for more and more, which can lead to borderline insanity. That said, it is a little inconsquetial at the end for Richard, but that's barely a critisism. Not every movie has to be heavy like that.It's not a movie everyone is going to love, but DO NOT get turned away by bad reviews. If you end up liking it, it's worth it.Edit: I have found that many of the negative reviews say something like ""it's not like the book"". You orangutangs need to realize that such comments ARE NOT VAILID CRITISISMS (on thier own)! A film adaption of a novel, or any translation of a story from one medium to another for that matter, has NO OBLIGATION to be a perfect replica of original medium. Of course it ought to obey the general structure and themes, but you have to also remember that some storytelling tequiniques, descriptions, and elements of pacing simply do not translate well from say, a book to a movie. Inevitably, some things will change. But people hate change and when something is new it's automatically on their bad side. That's the crux of these garbage 1/10 reviews. If the film is a blatant disrespect or diservice to the original, you need to explain very specifically and objectively why that is true, otherwise THAT IS CALLED A NON-CRITISISM. YOU'RE COMPLAINING, NOT CRITIQUEING! It's not like this book is some sort of world renown classic either. This minority of people have litteraly just congregated here to bash this movie. It's average score really should probably be at least 7.0-7.5. You're not smart haters!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Dumb Movie.....Badly Made,"There are many problems with the Beach. The story is ridiculous---and the actors give limp performances---indicating that they too did not believe in the project. The script is really bad...as banal as its possible to be. Danny Boyles direction is clunky...and he does not get good performances from his actors. Was this aimed at a teenage audience? Perhaps we will never know. Leonardo Di Capprio is totally un-convincing in the leading role. When that happens, the movie is almost certain to fail...and this one does. There is a market for movies that are SO bad..they must be watched. This doesn't quite fit into that category...but its near..!!!",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Vastly underrated,"This movie received a lot of hate when it came out due to DiCaprio's fame with females after his appearance in Titanic (much like how everyone loves to hate Bieber today), and I kept far away from this movie for many years. I too only knew him from Titanic at that point, and when I saw him shirtless on the movie poster I had pretty clear assumptions of what this movie would be like. But I was wrong. This movie is great. Its a captivating 90s new age adventure with lots of twists and thrills, and i kicked myself for not watching it sooner.

CHEER! - (8 stars out of 10),"The stage curtains open ...""The Beach"", despites the poor accolades, was a nice departure from your average cinema, showcasing a red hot Leonardo DiCaprio, still feeling the success of ""Titanic"". He was in his mid-20's when he made this film, appealing to a younger audience, before he would move on to much harder hitting, adult roles. He was nominated for the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor with his performance, but that is not at all what this film was about.DiCaprio is Richard, a young American who's found his way overseas to Bangkok looking to put a little excitement into his life. A chance encounter with the man staying in a room next to his, places in his possession a map that supposedly leads to one of nature's best kept secrets - a perfect, life changing, hidden beach. On a whim, Richard asks a young couple, also staying in the hotel, to join him in finding the beach. They agree and soon they are on an adventure. When they arrive, it is everything they had hoped for ... but, as is usually the case, there is trouble in paradise.This film's strengths lie in it's outstanding cinematography with a soundtrack to match. As a younger person myself, when I first saw this film, I was drawn to it and even wished I was with them to experience the adventure myself. When they walked out on to the beautiful white sands before crystal blue wters and the song, ""Porcelain"" by Moby, was playing ... it was an awesome moment. In fact, I went out and bought the soundtrack to the movie, just so I could have that song.I personally loved this movie and give it a high recommendation at a strong 8 stars out of 10. It does get a little weird at the end, but overall, well worth the time. I don't watch this movie for landmark acting ... I watch it for the experience of the music, and the beach.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Plot? Acting? Direction? Writing?,"Plot? Acting? Direction? Writing? Who cares as long as sexy Leo is shirtless. That alone probably sold this movie. Sad, but true. The fact that Mathew Perry's younger better looking lost brother takes off his shirt is enough to get a studio to waste millions of dollars.Yeah sure Leo can act. But not here. Here he is playing himself. A big dull jerk. He should stop partying and get back to sharpening those acting chops.The movie: It blows. It starts out good. But lots of movies start out good. It's easy to start a movie in the right direction. But this one beaches itself early and sits there flopping like a dying fish for the rest of the movie.Do we want to be Fight Club? Lord of the Flies? Apocolypse Now? Midnight Express? What do we want to be cause we sure aren't original. The premise is too old to be original so it would of been better to pick an angle and go all the way with it.If you want to go do the paradise turns to hell thing then do it. Don't stop halfway and decide to throw in a whole bunch of other junk.Danny Boyle is a good director, I like most all of his other stuff. I even like A Life Less Ordinary. Which leads me to believe most of it can be blamed on Leo. Once Leo is involved you got unneeded clout and pressure. Will it be something the 14 girls can watch? Will they like it? Will they see it over and over? Danny Boyle and Leo seem to be such and odd pair. Leo used to be Danny Boyle material until Titanic (What's Eating gilbert Grape, Basketball Diaries). Then he was big studio property. He's no longer edgy just cocky.Anyways. I wonder if this would of been better with Ewan Macgregor in the lead. Probably since Ewan is infinitely more likeable. There were some parts I liked. Like him killing the shark. Only because I hate sharks and I would love to be able to kill one if I was attacked. The music is good. The scenery is good but not incredible enough to spawn that type of devotion the characters have towards it.Major problem was nobody was likeable. Except the French Guy. The only one who was a decent human being. The rest were arrogant obnoxious selfish cruel hipsters hiding from their yuppy fates.Yet another reminder we are all flawed and bad people.My response to this annoying trend in films: I watch movies to escape. I don't need to be reminded that people suck. I know they suck. Show me idealized heroes. So me people with character, integrity. So me tragedies. But make the hero have at least one really good quality please. These qualities don't need to be limited to Disney oversimplified portrayals.This is a terrible review. It's all over the place.Kinda like the movie.Skip this movie unless you're a 14 year old girl (who probabaly has already seen it) Rent Lord of the Flies instead.

I'll just mention the two best ones: Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert Carlyle.The bad. That video game overlay. It's not necessarily a faux pas, because it's well tailored to the persona and his psychosis, but it just doesn't fit very nicely with the rest of the movie style.The ugly. Nothing.The result.

The Beach review,"I just recently rewatched the beach with Leonardo DiCaprio, and it was great! I have become a very big fan of DiCaprio over the years, and a lot of people seem to think that this film wasn't one of his stronger points. I grant you, it wasn't one of his best movies, but his performance in it is mesmerising as usual. With Danny Boyle directing, we see the more exotic side to Di Caprio with him topless on the beach. It reminded me more of a James Bond style to the film (Casino Royale) with Di Caprio being Bond. DiCaprio gives a very powerful performance as Richard in the film, and shows off his skills as an Actor. The same year as this, Di Caprio was offered the role of Patrick Bateman in 'American Psycho' which after turning down, then went to Christian Bale. Di Caprio took this role on instead. This film I don't think would have given as good of a performance as American Psycho would for Leo, but Leo sure gives his best, as he is very captivating every second he is on screen, with full commitment to the role!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
somewhere there is a place where you want to be,"and this is the beach. I read the book after I saw the film but both are art of their own. I have been at some of the places where they shot the movie. The center plot is about Richard making holidays backpacking in Thailand, finding a remote island where a bunch of people are living on a wonderful beach, away from modern society and enjoying life under palm trees and with much marijuana. The story twists when this society breaks on the usual problems of mankind: power, love, weapons, physical injuries, etc.The movie has wonderful nature shots of the island and the beach, a very good soundtrack (which i hear in my car from time to time), good act and brings the feeling of the story to life. The book is more towards the idea of American (and generally western) fascination for Vietnam and apocalypse now, Richard is talking to a phantom in his head about going to Vietnam, etc.If you ever thought about making a trip to goa or thailand, watch this movie.

"Not the worst of 2000, but not far from it","""The Beach"" has excellent photography, but provides nothing new it terms of story or acting talent.While the novel may be of high quality, the film seems like an expensive and take-off version of ""Lord of the Flies"" as there is a society, secret from other adults and nobody else can come in, least they'd be killed.The idea that people sneek in, that the society is all fun and games (and not killing, hence different/take-off of lord of the flies), that people cannot leave (they are in or out of the society to stay), make this a skulls/lord of the flies hybrid, with almost limitless possibilities.However, as the location can go nowhere, neither does the story. Apparently, the love interest, the friends who came with the map, and the funny shopping trips are supposed to add to the story.  However, they along with Leo's narration and the video game of Leo killing and stomping, and visually looking stupid detract from the beach atmosphere.They make us look deeper. Deeper is where we find and question--> Leo got $20 for this? The film crew trashed the Beach?Even without the detriments, The Beach is a beached whale.Robert Carlyle is interesting, but his character is mysterious and not fully flushed out.All-in-all, the movie's best (and perhaps only) redeeming quality is that there are worse.Rating: 2Viewed: in theatre (scope)",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

The Dream Vacation,"When I first saw ""The Beach"" it was like I was watching my dream vacation. Danny Boyles' attention to detail  brings out emotion in a way that makes his characters' experiences more personal to the viewer.  This detail is most notable in his immaculate character devopement of ""Richard"" (Leonardo DiCaprio,) which is an art that seems to be lost in film today.  It also is apparent in Richards' affair with Virginie Ledoyens' character ""Francoise. The way their relationship unfolds was so real yet so romantically ""Hollywood"" at the same time, like a dream.  I must say, the casting of Virginie Ledoyen made the movie much more exotic and mysterious as she is such a beautiful and talented female actress that has been virtually untouched my American cinema.  After seeing ""The Beach MULTIPLE times it made me realize that the best trips are the ones where no matter how much went wrong, all you think about when remembering them is how much went so right.

Disjointed and ill--conceived,"This was a horrible movie of epic proportion. Run, don't walk away from this movie. Not all of the teeny boppers in the world can save this movie. Word of mouth is very powerful and in this case it will destroy the movie. The movie was an embarrassing adaption of a stylish book. They changed some very key points in the book. Richard wasn't supposed to get together with Francoise, because no one ever gets the French girl, but in the movie they fall in love. DiCaprio did what he does  best: running around sobbing and looking suicidal. The only thing that could have saved this movie is if they would have spent less time with Richard having his way with Francoise, and more time focusing on divisions in the community, and Richard's gradual loss of reality. So please take my advice, spend your money on a movie like Magnolia...and put DiCaprio out of his misery.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
The purpose of this film...,"If you listen to what is really going on through out the movie- i.e. the secrecy of the island, Christo's fate, Sal's breakdown- shows how humanity is nothing more than the flaws we either overcome or succumb to. Great study of human nature. The whole thing starts out as Leonardo DiCaprio searches for adventure, traveling from country to country, no real way of knowing how he supports himself financially (never really mentioned outright in the movie), but seeing the things he does for entertainment makes one wonder if he may have a gambling problem, or if he is really just that bored. This film definitely takes his character on the ride he was asking for, but the ending was not exactly what he had been expecting as an outcome.

Wtf?!,"For a movie directed by Danny Boyle (Sunshine, 28 Days Later, Trainspotting,etc.) that stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Tilda Swinton... this was pretty bad.

This crazy guy (Bugs) gives Richard a map that leads him to this perfect place Bugs then proceeds to kill himself. Of course, Richard goes to the beach (along with his romantic interest and her French boyfriend).I mean, we've seen this storyline before... what do you think will happen? Tilda Swinton gives a decent performance as the island leader, Sal, but besides that there isn't really anything special about this movie. It's not that bad up until this certain sequence involving a video game world... then it turns to complete crap! The musical ""score"" is bland, and when it tries to be original it does not go very well with the film being presented. The ending is sudden and completely breaks off from the entire movie... we've been watching this movie this whole time knowing one thing for certain... and then they take that certain thing away... what are we left with?

Handsome and shallow,"""The Beach"" is a Di Caprio vehicle gone south. This is even more obvious 12 years after its original release. Di Caprio, then a baby-faced, attractive star, fresh from the success of Titanic, plays Richard a handsome backpacker in a postcard-pretty Thailand (minus the shabby hotel) populated by many other attractive youngsters.Given the premises, this could have easily turned into an over-bloated ad for fizzy drinks, but luckily some darkness is infused into the story,via several bizarre plot twists. The first one involves Robert Carlyle, who worked already with Boyle in the glorious Trainspotting.Carlyle's cameo is dark and disturbing. It takes place right at the beginning and it is a sign that all will not be well. The middle part is light-hearted. Richard gets acquainted with a couple of stunning-looking French models (I mean, tourists) and they travel searching for paradise on earth.What they find is a sort of hippie community, living on a hidden beach, next door to a marijuana plantation guarded by armed thugs. Not my idea of paradise, but stillIf we forgot about the ominous signs, now it is time to get our memory refreshed.The hippie colony is run by a weird Tilda Swinton (not a big stretch for her playing weirdo) and her iron fist will bring nothing but misfortune to everybody. Anyway, the hippies are not painted as altruistic and kind. They are more selfish, lazy people running away from responsibilities and their demise is welcomed with a feeling of retribution. The end feels abrupt and much over the top, compared with the relative mildness of the rest of the movie.Overall, Di Caprio already showed strong acting skills, but the whole – thin – plot revolves too much around him and eventually collapses in its shallowness",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Gem,"The Beach is one of my favorite movies of all time - definitely in my Top 10 with Lawrence of Arabia, the Usual Suspects, and Fight Club. It combines the talents of a great director, a great writer, and a great actor. I would describe The Beach as a modern day Lord of the Flies.It was advertised as a love story to appeal to the post-Titanic Leo fan base of teenage girls. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is a movie about the pursuit of 'paradise' in contrast to the supposed advancement of human society. It is often violent, trippy and disturbing, just as it is pretty, funny, and exciting.Don't miss this highly underrated movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Paradise,"My name is Richard. So what else do you need to know? Stuff about my family, or where I'm from? None of that matters. Not once you cross the ocean and cut yourself loose, looking for something more beautiful, something more exciting and yes, I admit, something more dangerous. So after eighteen hours in the back of an airplane, three dumb movies, two plastic meals, six beers and absolutely no sleep, I finally touch down; in Bangkok. Trust me, it's paradise. This is where the hungry come to feed. From mine it's a generation that circles the globe and searches for something we haven't tried before. So never refuse an invitation, never resist the unfamiliar, never fail to be polite and never outstay the welcome. Just keep your mind open and suck in the experience. And if it hurts, you know what? It's probably worth it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
rather read the book,"How do they manage to make such a crappy movie out of such a good book?! Sometimes I had the feeling they were just changing the story for the sake of changing it. Many of the changes were completely unnecessary and some even crippled the story. The book made far more sense than the movie does.And couldn't they find some other main actor? Leonardo DiCaprio is not convincing as Richard whatsoever. You just don't believe him the traveler. He rather seems to be that very nice kid, that's in the wrong movie the whole time. It seems pathetic that he would have set out for an adventure like that and made the choices he made. It just seemed very odd and contradicting to his character (Even though he played a quite similar guy in Titanic and was very believable there) Furthermore, I just wanna hit him every time he opens his mouth. I've never heard anybody constantly saying so much rubbish. Is he blond?",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
This movie is AWESOME!!!,"Alright the movie starts out with an adventurous vibe. A guy in a foreign land, seeking adventure, timid but curious at the same time. Within the first few seconds of the movie a guy asks Leo to drink snake blood! Everything is so exotic and out of this world! It's a real adventure. A treasure hunt for something beyond the norm. A front seat ride to paradise, no seat belts included! It's crazy pack full of emotion laughter sorrow drama and of course, tropical waters clear enough to see that this movie is an A++++ film! It's as playful as it is serious in the true quest for man to find peace in a world of anger. Whats the final message the movie attempts to get across?

Beach plays like a fish out of water,"When Leonardo DiCaprio was riding the wave of Titanic's seemingly endless cashflow, he considered carefully which screen roles to pursue next. Should he be a dashing hero, or a romantic lead? For any newly minted Hollywood star, the next role or roles are exceedingly crucial. The follow-up to a blockbuster doesn't have to make as bombastic a splash as its predecessor, but it can't get by with just a ripple, either.So what does the so-called ""King of the World"" choose to do? This adaptation of Alex Garland's novel about a young lost soul who wants to get more out of life and finds an island paradise in the South Pacific. Remember how Lord of the Flies was? Well, if you had any English in high school or college, you'll remember that the setting there was an island where prep-school boys had crashlanded. And all goes well, until they submit to their base instincts and become savages. When Richard (DiCaprio) and his friends find this island, that movie/book was the first thing I thought of. It's all there - the rituals, the diversions, the bonding-through-suffering. And it's all very, very well photographed, too. In fact, the more I looked at the island, the more it looked like the one in Survivor on CBS, only with fewer rats and a whole heaping helping of marijuana. Seems the people on the island are basically self-sufficient, leaving the world behind and taking care of themselves, save for occasional forays back to the mainland for goods they can't get on their own island.This movie just solidifies the old theory that says if you take a mediocre actor and put him in a BIG MOVIE, where the BIG special effects are the main draw, he'll do just fine; put him in a movie where he actually needs to ACT, and he's not so hot. DiCaprio's character isn't particularly nice, which is fine; but he's also played in a hopeless, one-dimensional way, with a careless - not necessarily carefree - attitude. I'm sure DiCaprio is a good guy; at least I have no evidence to the contrary. But in this film, there simply isn't any THERE there. His character, essential to the plot, since he's the protagonist, is about as effective as the proverbial puptent in a windstorm.It goes without saying that DiCaprio got script approval, too - coming off Titanic, and all - since he seems to be able to bed down with practically every female in the movie. Which is kind of eerie, since to me he looks about 12 years old. But hey - some people seem to think he's hot stuff. Oh, and despite a lot of swimming and rain, Leo's hair never seems to move much, but maybe I'm just nitpicking.As for the plot - well, like most of the dung floating on the big screens these days, you should be able to predict it all the way through. Some of the actions of these islanders will leave you scratching your head. If this is what would happen in a paradise setting with so-called 'civilized' people, I'll take savage headhunting tribes any day.I won't lay all of the blame on poor Leo. The acting is absolutely wretched, and the whole time I'm watching this dreck I'm wondering why these infantile boobs were even STAYING on the island. I know, that's a slap at the screenwriting as much as at the acting. But aside from the magnificent scenery, this is a virtually unwatchable movie.Your best bet is to simply skip this yawner and check out Survivor itself. At least there the actions and reactions are a little more realistic - although, knowing how well-staged that show is, maybe not all THAT realistic.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

Only The Beach of This Isle Is Wonderful,I find the film harmless because it tries hard to follow the adventure or thriller genre. The movie begins promisingly but then there are some ridiculous scenes. It could have been more done because I missed some real action moments or more suspense elements. Sometimes I thought they wanted to carry me on this isle to spend my precious time that was unfortunately wasted at the end. The scenery is no doubt wonderful; just imagine to be there and to relax on this fine white sand. Thank you for this nice panoramic view but next time please combine all with a clever story and don't think only for teenagers.

Marooned.,"Director Danny Boyle has since admitted this wasn't a very good film. It takes strong character to own up to one's mistakes, so for this he must be applauded. Anfortunately, myself and many other people had the misfortune to see it before we knew even the director didn't believe in it. The beach was marketed as some sort of conventional thriller/drama which would be the next showcase for heart-throb Leonardo Dicaprio following his huge success with Titanic. Had its makers gone ahead and made a conventional thriller, it might have at least been a box office success. But the finished product is a confused, fantasy-ridden film that tries to be much more introspective than it needs to be. That it is narrated by a character that is neither interesting nor believable only adds to the problem.Leo plays an American tourist who finds himself alone and bored in a grimy Thailand hotel. A nutty guy from the room next door gives him a map to an island supposedly home to a new-age community with an endless supply of pot at their disposal. Leo is immediately intrigued by this map. Especially once this nut-job commits suicide. He and a young French couple follow the map and end up swimming out to this island and joining the community which really does exist. Personally, I would have turned around and swam back to the mainland after meeting the insufferable Euro-types that make up this community. They are led by Tilda Swinton who plays the same character she always does. An icy, witchy woman. At least she almost looks attractive in this film for a change. She has a strong-armed boyfriend who is a complete jerk. The rest of the island is patrolled by armed marijuana farmers who allow the community to exist as long is it doesn't allow too many new members or gives away their secret. Leo ends up sleeping with the young French woman. Her boyfriend doesn't seem too broken up about it. Not much of interest really happens after that. A couple guys who look like ABBA rejects are attacked by a shark. Probably revenge for Leo killing another shark. We've all seen the Jaws films, and apparently sharks DO take things personally.Ughh. Since the film is so unfocused, its hard to write anything other than a rambling review. By the last 45 minutes, director Boyle has grown pretty desperate. He throws in animated sequences, fantasy killing sprees, you name it. Nothing any of the characters does by this point makes any sense. Sure, the film looks great, but how could it not with these locations to shoot in? Decaprio has never really impressed as an actor, and he certainly didn't have what it took back then to make us believe in his character. Maybe it helps to smoke pot, and then any true meaning in this film would become clear. Or at least its lack of focus wouldn't matter so much. 5 of 10 stars.The Hound.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

DiCaprio's celebrity overshadows.,"DiCaprio fever seems to have obscured the worth of this film on its own merits. His celebrity seems to have overshadowed and killed serious criticism of this film, I believe. If ""Lord of the Flies"" is seen as a reference, I think a case can be made that this film makes some very powerful and effective statements about classic Utopianism among the children of the jaded and bored richer classes. DiCaprio plays his spoiled American very well. The young man is a great actor. The role of Tilda Swinton is well written, but I think she made her character too intelligent and complex with her excellent, but intense, acting. The jockish and superficial tribe members were much more convincing. I loved the international casting. The cast and the setting are visual knock outs. Robert Carlyle brought his ""Trainspotting"" insanity to the film, but I think his character was written over the top. Paterson Joseph, as Keaty, was a stand out. Guillame Canet, as Etienne, worked well as the tortured cast off in his particular love triangle. It took two viewings of this film for me to see past its stunning visuals and over-the-top highs and lows to appreciate it for its intelligent themes.

The film is so well done that I didn't get distracted at all, it just kind of flows naturally and you are really attached to the characters. You might feel excitement, anger, fear, sadness. There have been a few places where I thought the characters should have done something else - but that is me, someone would probably have acted the way they did.

Painful to watch. Skip it and READ THE BOOK.,"I just read Alex Garland's highly readable and entertaining novel, and immediately went out and rented the film version. I don't know what I was expecting, but this was quite possibly the worst film adaptation I've ever seen. I became concerned after 15 minutes, pretty much gave up hope at 40 minutes, and stopped watching 2/3 of the way through in sheer disgust. They missed so many opportunities to make this a good film that I found myself clenching my teeth and my fists every time they f*cked it up. Which they did with astonishing frequency. The best parts of the novel, the most beautifully imagined, surreal, powerful, essential scenes are *nonexistent* in the film version, and the rest is needlessly changed around and incompetently adapted. Things that would have made sense in the book make no sense in the movie, because the scriptwriter apparently thought ""This would be cool!"" and changed around things that are essential for understanding later developments. Other times, they try to show extreme emotions and character flaws way too early in the film without any background to explain why these feelings or conditions exist in the characters. Instead of showing how the characters change over the course of their experiences, the filmmakers apparently thought they could save some time and effort by making them that way in the first place! There is none of the wonderfully subtle character development and gradual revelations that exist in the book. The result is a confused and totally mismanaged mess. I don't agree with the general maxim that voice-over always covers for bad writing, but that is completely obviously true in this particular film.I really hope this gets remade in the future, by people who have some clue about what they're doing. The two partially redeeming qualities of the film are some moments of genuine humor and a few beautifully shot scenes. The rest is garbage. Completely inappropriate soundtrack, mangled script, an astonishingly bad performance by Leonardo DiCaprio... Save yourself 2 hours of torture and read the book instead.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
"I appreciated and enjoyed it, even with its major flaw","There is a lot to like here, even though there are some major flaws, too. At first I thought it starred Matt Damon, who is great, but in the lobby of the theater on the way in I saw it starred Leonardo DeWatchimacallit, who I dislike and distrust. So I was prepared to hate ""The Beach,"" but was surprised at how very good it was. I was particularly impressed with Leonardo, who I had previously thought of as nothing more than a giggling trifle. He can act! And he can come off as a actual man, too, not just the foppish object of teeny-bopper desire. Good job, bud!The first hour is powerful, mysterious, beautiful, and very engaging. The second hour is probably where the detractors were turned off. Admittedly, the conceptual material becomes really corny-- the type of obvious, belabored ideas about hedonism, love, character, etc. that one would expect from a precocious 19 year-old. I imagine that 35 years ago ""The Beach"" would have been a stunner-- and it would have been hailed as a gripping, bold view into the darker parts of the human heart. Now, the moral lessons and conclusions seem naive to the point of silliness. But wait! In spite of that, there is something about this movie that is immensely rewarding and entertaining. A vibe of pure power, and a vibrant life emanate from every scene. I can't explain it beyond that-- this movie has LIFE. And it is technically perfect, too. Visually amazing, well acted, well edited, etc.  It's kind of the opposite of the recent movie ""Snow Falling on Cedars,"" in which the scenery was rare and imposing (lots of snow on lots of cedars), but it was empty and sterile. As a movie it struck many folks as lifeless and dreary. ""The Beach,"" by contrast, looks like a masterpiece, and feels like a great movie-- even though the story kind of falls apart towards the end. Often times flawed movies piss one off, but this movie won me over and had me appreciating it even as I was seeing the conclusion as amateurishly juvenile.

Great Movie (Believe it or Not),"I'm a Danny Boyle fan. Not the biggest fan in the world, but I certainly enjoy his style. However, I had heard that this movie was a stinker, so I decided to give it a pass for a while. When I did get around to seeing it, I was blown away.1. The acting. The acting was superb. Robert Carlyle was excellent as Daffy. Both french actors (Virginie Ledoyen and Guilliaume Canet) were solid. DiCaprio was great. One review I read accuses him of playing a ""nobody"" but I assure you that this is exactly why he was so brilliantly cast. He's an American twenty-something on vacation in Thailand. He is unsure of himself and he is capable. He doesn't know what he wants or why he's here. DiCaprio plays this part perfectly, acting both unsure and overconfident. Tilda Swin is perfect as the leader of a small island community.2. Storytelling. This movie is really hard to place. It starts out as a ""finding oneself"" type film with some thriller elements. It ends up... somewhere I did not expect it to go. THe story follows a windy road full of twists and turns, and takes the viewer to places he had no intention of going. It should also be mentioned that this film is fairly similar to Apocalypse Now (Boyle's Favorite Film). This movie is also funny. I wasn't expecting that either. There are moments (very few, actually) of fun and play in this overall rather dark story.3. Score, editing, cinematography, etc. When I watch a Danny Boyle film, I am always reminded of the other films he's made, both stylistically and thematically. Despite using different cinematographers, his films invariably have a specific visual style (much more apparent in his later films) with angled camera, and rich blues, yellows and greens. In many ways, this film reminded me a little of Trainspotting crossed with 127 Hours. It's less flashy than one, and more than the other, and deals with some similar elements of trial that are present 127 Hours, as well as an interesting cast of characters, like Trainspotting. Both films have at least one hallucination/insanity moment, but I will not go too far down that road for fear of uncovering spoilers. The score was fine, I felt it fit the film rather well, giving it the flashy wildness of the 2000 without going overboard. Most of the soundtrack has a kind of retro synth feel combined with a more modern beat. Not the best music on the planet, but nothing to lose sleep over.Anyways, I could go more in depth about specific story elements, plot devices and scene structures, but I won't for brevity's sake. But, to sum up my review: I loved it. At many points during the film I found myself thinking: this is such a good movie.

Shallow Adaptation Of An Excellent Novel,"Alex Garland's novel, ""The Beach"", was one of those rare books I absolutely could not put down until I'd finished it. I walked across busy streets reading it. It had me hooked.Now, I didn't expect that the movie adaptation could live up to that standard, but I really did expect something better than this. Leonardo DiCaprio didn't strike me as an appropriate choice for Richard, but the prospect of Robert Carlyle as Daffy gave me hope--how could he not be perfect in that role?This movie showed me how.I suppose there's no point in further unfavourable comparisons to the book.

Over-dressed and boring,"The beach is a beautiful movie. You could almost watch it with the sound off, much in the vein of the ""Endless Summer"" surfing movies...because outside of scenery, it's hard for me to see anything else to waste time on.The movie starts out interestingly enough. Robert Carlyle gives such an energetic performance in his small roll it almost suggests of great things to come. This expectation lasts up until our heroes find their island paradise, and then the entire thing down-shifts into neutral. As reviewers have stated, few of the characters in this movie are likeable; they are pretentious, naive and treacherous. Their loyalties lie to themselves and their pleasures alone. Dicaprio gives an uninspired performance as perhaps the most despicable of the lot...his selfishness and childish behavior destroying any sympathy or empathy when his Kurtz-like descent into madness arrives. By the time the movie reaches its dramatic peak, I was too bored with the entire thing to care.I picked this up because of Danny Boyle's involvement. He does a nice job with the movie, but throws in way too many bells and whistles in attempt to make a bad story interesting. I've never read the book, but if it's anything like this adaption...I'll never understand how it sold like it did. This is a complete yawner. It presents a obvious and tired examination of that certain clique-ish side of human nature that pervades the island camp. The conclusion is anti-climactic and predictable. The characters are not developed at all; it's like watching an episode of ""The Real World"". The acting (with the exception of Carlyle and Tilda Swinton) is weak. As other reviewers have stated, another actor in DiCaprio's place may have improved this movie significantly, as he is very unconvincing to say the least.The soundtrack is good for the most part. The scenery is beautiful....and there are enough beautiful people to fill a dozen bad sit-coms. Too bad there's dialogue. It would have been better off without it.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Surprisingly Good,"WOW, I just saw this movie last night at the Theatre I work at and I must say it was surprisingly good. I was expecting complete c**p and that is not what i got. I got an intelligent piece of filmmaking, Danny Boyle's second best film, Trainspotting being Number 1 of course. Is it a Masterpiece? Of Course not it has Leo Dio in it, but if you want to have fun for a few hours go see it, it can even be enlightening.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Regard on realism,romanticism and amusement","My opinion of the film is not very positive. It is not realistic at all,it starts very romantically and later turns into a contradiction of a utopian world. It is like an insight-experience of a child. (Aha-Erlebnis) Therefore it will be more successful for younger people. The humor is not very original, and the horror-effects are very simple.(My heart wasn't beating 2 or 3 times ,so it DID work!) It feels like a summary of effects, more then an emotional-logical web of events. The best aspect, I think, is the array of cinematografical (?) solutions, use of the film-hardware, camera-angles. The quality of images ( stills ) are very high. So it is more the ""How""  i.s.o. the ""What"" of cinema. For me it has very little to do with real-life-experiences. I get very curious about ""Train spotting"" (Next time I will try writing Dutch, this is too hard )",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
A real backpackers POV...,"Alex Garlands book was first published in 1995, the same year I set out with my future husband on a 2 year round the world backpacking trip, which was a profound & not altogether pleasent expierence. I got ameobic dysentry in Kathmandu, slipped & smashed my head open on a wet toilet floor in Bombay (now Mumbi) & on a bus journey, had a head on collision with a 10 ton truck on the side of a mountain near the Tibetan border, where I literally saw the words ""Game Over"" pop up in my eyes! But I also learned that backpackers of my era & the time frame of the Beach (1990's) were not very nice people.. This (by accident or by design) certainly comes across in The Beach!The characters in the Beach (in particular Richard) are the most obnoxious, self centered, ego driven bunch of oddballs ever to grace any film. However Tilda Swinton (a real life raving Marxist but an incredibly talented actress) as creepily unhinged leader Sal, gives an amazing performance, making this movie worth a watch. Di Caprio, on the other hand, is wooden, & very unrelatable as Richard. His occasional over acting is also irritating. The basic screenplay is equally unconvincing (I have seen it done it & bought the t shirt) as backpackers would never congregate with other backpackers in a secret commune. The reason is that each backpacker of my time liked to think their own expierence is unique, special, & never been done before. Real backpackers are ""travel snobs"" who are loath to admit that they cannot live without their western creature comforts, which is only breifly explored in the Beach. Backpackers will congregate in places where those western creature comforts are catered for, like Kho San Road in Bangkok. Their food is chips (fries) burgers & hot dogs, their entertainment is Hollywood movies, yet they dress in outlandish ""local"" clothes like Thai fishermans pants, badly tied sarongs & often looked like whacky clowns in tie dye! They have a parchent to eat their evening meals dressed only in beachwear & women sunbath topless with absolute no regard that this activity in Asia is considered offensive to the local culture. So I can well understand just why the Beach has such obnoxious characters, as it's not far from the truth. But a lot of this film remains unconvincing, like swimming in the open ocean in a straight line? No you would be carried by the current & miss the island entirely! Anyway the Beach ticks on quite nicely until it literally looses the plot in the second half of the film where Richard goes loopy & becomes Rambo & Super Mario at the same time. It is at this point, I quite frankly loose interest in this movie. It makes no sense, adds nothing to the plot & appears to be simply inserted to flesh out the film to an acceptable length of a movie.Well if anyone is looking for a taste into what backpacking was like in the 90's, this movie almost takes you there...almost. But us backpackers did not live in communes & never would! 5 stars for Tilda Swinton though. I might not agree with her politically (too many actors today forget that their job is to ACT & entertain us, NOT lecture us on Global Governance, climate change & how evil white men are) but Ms Swinton, you rock! x",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"If you're over 25, not really for you...","There could be a miracle and someone over the age 25 may like this movie, but it is clearly targeted for those under that age bracket.I, in fact, did enjoy the movie.  I was interested the whole way through. Much to my surprise, the movie contained much more than reviews and previews had let on.To sum the movie up in a few words is to say that it is about a paradise that can't exist, yet the challenge in finding one and believing in it. And how far can it go until the inevitable happens. There is more to this movie than a half-naked Leonardo and a bunch of teenagers finding a place to smoke weed. It doesn't require much thinking, just sitting back and enjoying the film, which I think rated better than most thought so.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bad choice for Leo,"Leonardo DiCaprio's brilliant work in Titanic (though not his best) and the unexpected explosion of popularity that ensued, opened wide the floodgates of his career. He now earns a Tom Cruise-sized paycheck for any old project he chooses to attach himself to. We all hoped he would choose his projects wisely (from what I have heard about American Psycho, he was wise to turn it down).If hindsight were 20/20, one could argue for his passing on The Beach as well, the film adaptation of wonder boy Alex Garland's novel, which I have not read. The source material notwithstanding, this is a grim tale that goes everywhere you don't expect. Usually this would be a good thing, but this project meanders endlessly as we take a trip through the slowly fragmenting mind of Richard (Leo), an adventurous twentysomething just looking for a little excitement in his life.Richard's journey begins in Thailand, where he stays in the world's worst motel and ends up living next to Daffy Duck (Robert Carlyle), a dope-smoking psychotic raving about a hidden beach on an island paradise. Because Richard doesn't really know what he wants to do with his life and he's real bored, he buys the story, takes Daffy's map, and sets out to find the island. He even finds two more suckers willing to be stupid with him, the lovely Francoise (Virginie Ledoyen) and Etienne (Guillaume Canet), French lovers traveling together (but of course, it's Leo and poor Etienne never stands a chance).When they finally find the island, the film becomes a bit humorous (intentionally, I think) as we meet its inhabitants, basically a bohemian mini-culture living in complete seclusion from the world, calling themselves Parallel Universe. The group's founder, chairperson, and den mother, Sal (Tilda Swinton), is obsessively protective of their culture. The fun ends like it always does, and the film gets increasingly trippy, ugly, and violent: In a word, `disturbing.'In the end we're supposed to realize that paradise is something to be earned, not claimed: You can run from the world, but eventually it will find you. One humorous scene features the members of the group, one by one, giving Richard their long lists of items needed from civilization. He and Sal (who naturally can't resist Leo's charms either) are to make a trip back into Thailand (for extra rice or something). It occurs to you, even as you're watching this scene, that the crew and passengers of the U.S.S. Minnow were so much cooler and more resourceful than these losers!Beach, of course, was made by the writing/directing team who brought us the far superior Trainspotting, John Hodge and Danny Boyle. Their creative stamp is most definitely visible here and they do create some memorable visual imagery. This is due in large part to the masterful photography by the distinguished, versatile Darius Khondji, the man responsible for Se7en, Delicatessen, City of Lost Children, and Evita. I can't recommend The Beach, but I'd still run out and see the next Boyle/Hodge collaboration. Come to think of it, I've seen every one of them since 1994's Shallow Grave.Grade: D+",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Read the book after seeing the movie,"If you already read the book ""The Beach"" and you are thinking about seeing the movie, forget it.  You *will* be disappointed.  If you have already seen this movie and you really liked it, READ THE BOOK!  The book is so much better.  Though the scenery in the movie was vivid and stimulating, your mental pictures will be more rewarding, believe me.Leonardo definitely doesn't belong in his role of Richard.  The movie messed up all the conflict he has dealing with his lust for Francoise, etc. Obviously, I made the mistake of seeing the movie after reading the book. I won't say it was bad, just disappointing.  They really change a lot to put it on the screen.  The reason I give the movie a ten is because the soundtrack to the movie is brilliant.

The Ultimate Paradise is the Ultimate Fascist Hell.,"Leonardo DiCaprio is Richard, a back-packer that finds The Beach; ""The Ultimate Paradise"". The Beach is an urban myth, spread among the tourists in Thailand. Richard, of course, goes to The Beach.Where the film starts off in a nice pace, building up a nice story, and even with a very nice monologue in the beginning, it soon becomes a tale about fascism, and how good it is. Even DiCaprio's character is in on this, and we never really see him turn his back against these ideas. He claims, in the middle of the movie, that The Beach isn't ruled by ism's or religions, no ideals, no ideas. But nevertheless, the inhabitants on The Beach play by fascist rules and think like nazis.This isn't too obvious for the General Moviegoer, and hence, this movie is kind of dangerous, since it doesn't develope these ideas in the ""correct way"". Though, maybe the writer IS a nazi, but then, why the hell did this film get distribution?The Beach is a movie that sucks. Big time. The violence is well made, but mean. The action is good, but uneven. The production is technically stunning, but slow, and in a very weird pace. And the editing, well, the editing is very weird. In the end we have a ""computer game scene"" to show us that DiCaprio is going insane. Why did they think this was a good idea in the first place?The resolution of the movie is very sloppy made, or, as said before, the production team really likes the idea of fascism and that humans are not worth enough if you want to protect An Idea.Don't see The Beach. Don't give The Fascists your money. They don't deserve it.3 out of 10 - only because of very nice technologically produced film.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

Very Disappointing,"Having read the amazing book by Alex Garland I was really looking forward to seeing the movie version, however I was left completely disappointed.The film was completely glamorised. The characters in the story were what made the book so enjoyable but they were portrayed so differently in the film. In the film Richard was just plain nasty and when he begun to loose it, he lost it big time. However in the book he was just an ordinary bloke who gradually goes insane due to the mad situation he is presented with. I can understand why in the film Richard s***s Francoise, which did not happen in the book, because there is a lot of sexual tension between them; but there is no way Richard would have had sex with Sal. There are so many faults with the script and direction that left me so unsatisfied. Whilst I can understand some of the difficulties the director, Danny Boyle (Trainspotting) was faced with, for example the scripting of the character, Bugs who haunts Richard throughout the film as a ghostly figure, I believe the film lacked the depth and intrigue which made the book so addictive.The only good thing about this film was the cinematography. The locations were beautifully shot and the wonderfully exotic images I construed whilst reading the book were brought to life on film.Don't be put off by this film just READ THE BOOK!",,Anonymous,Romance

I was not sure anymore which parts of the movie were ""real"" and which not. The ending itself is rushed, unconvincing, unresolving, unrealistic, more confusing.

If you have such a good artwork as ""The Beach"" by Alex Garland, then stick to it or leave it. The director didn´t stick to it and unfortunately didn´t leave it either. So the result is crap, every character has been changed in a way you get a different story at all. What has remained, is the names - not much. Just one thing to point out: The director leaves out Jed, one of the most important characters of Garland´s book and tries to disperse this person over a bunch of others. Those ""others"" again, then of course can´t stick to their original characters/plots and so on. The storyline ends in an ultimate mess, inescapable.

"I give this amazing,top adventure 10/10,a definite'must see'","I give this film an excellent 10/10 because it is exciting, exhilarating and enjoyable from start to finish. In a lot of films you can usually guess what will probably happen next, which could be boring. In The Beach, anything could happen from start to finish, and it is full of unexpected twists and turns which keep you interested & 'on the edge of your seat' all the way through. Leonardo Dicaprio plays Richard as the leading actor, a backpacker desperately searching for an escape from the frustrating, stressing hustle and bustle of the city, trying to find a place free from trouble, his own idealistic paradise. Will he succeed? And is there really such a place free from worries?......... Dicaprio shows off his great talent once more in this film and no-one could suit this part better. It is set in Thailand, the main location on a beautiful island off the coastline. This wonderful place is a perfect setting for the film and lets the imagination run wild in the possibility of being in paradise. The strange thing is, it is real. This is why The Beach influences many people to travel across the world to experience not only Thailand, but other places, to suit their own 'ideal paradise'. Another reason to watch it is that The Beach also has many top tunes on its soundtrack, including the best-selling single of 2000, 'Pure Shores' by All Saints.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

A missed opportunity....,"Having waited months for this film, the final result was very disappointing. Originally seeing a trailer way back in June of '99 I immediately read the book, which was amazing.  However the film just doesn't work.  The story is changed way too much, characters and events left out or changed for unknown reasons and the new additions detract from it.  People with me who hadn't read Alex Garlands novel found it difficult to follow some themes and the terrible video game sequence just capped off the pretty boring middle piece.Too much has been crammed into a short period of time and as such the audience catches only hints of the information they need to understand why people act as they do.This is all annoying as an opportunity has definitely been missed.

wow.,"This review is for anyone who has previously seen this movie and actually liked it--run now, because you are going to be arrested soon for possession. Pot, crack, heroin, SOMETHING... because you were obviously high when you saw this film. ""The Beach"" was by far the absolute worst movie I have ever seen. There was nothing I enjoyed about it--I was too p***ed off about how completely moronic it was to even LOOK at the scenery. Once I saw this movie called ""The Triangle"" and hated it. It is on TV right now and looks like it should win Best Picture in comparison to ""The Beach."" How anyone ever came up with the idea to write this screenplay is beyond me. Apparently the book is pretty good... sorry to whoever wrote it, but the movie is so bad that I no longer have any respect for you or anyone you know. Leonardo DiCarprio is now my least favorite actor.In summary, watching this movie made me want to kill myself. I am not a suicidal person, but after realizing that there are people on earth who enjoyed watching ""The Beach"" I decided that life is no longer worth living.

I'm not a big fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, but I can't see this picture without him being the lead actor. Same as Titanic really. This movie can be very trippy, and to some rather dull if they don't like the modern day sense it has. In summary, it's about a traveler in Thailand who has a need for something more. He doesn't want to do what every other tourist does. He finds out about an island which is said to be a myth. He meets two other travelers and they make their way to this island where they are greeted with an absolute paradise.

Pretty awful in almost every way,"I first saw this movie in Cinemas when it came out, and was originally very disappointed in it. However, after having the misfortune to see it again recently, I realise I was overly generous with my initial feelings about it.The film is awful. The acting is uniformly bad, though the actors aren't helped by a dreadful script. It spends too much time pretending to be cool and admiring how supposedly hip it is, rather than telling an engaging story. The characters are cardboard, and thoroughly dislikable, though that description might be too flattering for Di Caprio's character of Richard.At the start of the film we here a brief bored sounding voice-over by Di Caprio, where he states, 'My name is Richard. That's all you need to know.' It's possibly the most redundant and laughable use of voice-over I have ever heard. And the movie gradually gets worse from here on in.Embarrassing 'fantasy' moments, such as when Richard abruptly goes insane, and the film turns into a bizarre computer game for a minute or so, drags the film down to new levels of cringeworthyness.The ending is also terrible. Di Caprio is sitting in a fancy internet café somewhere, and downloads a picture he has been emailed - it is of all his old 'friends' from the island, in a group smiling at the camera. Di Caprio smiles at this, with a hint of nostalgia, as if to say it was great fun after all, and that perhaps the experience was even worthwhile. This, even though several of the people in the photograph died gruesome deaths, he killed one of them, was shunned by his mates, and had a gun pointed at his head by another (a disgusting character played by Tilda Swinton).I really can't stop thinking of enough bad things to say about this film, so I'll be generous and stop there.Danny Boyle, why did you not retire after making this atrocity?",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Two pints of snake blood please!,"I really enjoyed The Beach. After Titanic, I was sceptical of DiCaprio movies, but here he's clearly trying to show he's a serious actor and he does a great job.Considering himself to be superior in some way to the usual backpacking crowd, Richard (DiCaprio) is looking for something different that'll take him away from the tourists and give him a 'real' experience. He's given a map of an Island from a deranged man called Daffy (brilliantly played by Robert Carlyle) and in an intense conversation, is told of a beach on the Island that is completely hidden and offers paradise.The next day he finds Daffy dead in his hotel room - he's committed suicide. Richard joins up with two French backpackers - Françoise (Virginie Ledoyen) and Étienne (Guillaume Canet) and sets out to find the Island...The acting in the movie is great throughout with DiCaprio showing he's not just a pretty face. It's shot beautifully - this is one of the best films to show off your new DVD player as the vibrant scenery is breathtaking. The soundtrack fits perfectly and gives it the feeling of a modern movie - the ambient sounding music fits with the post rave tourist culture depicted in the film.Without going into too much plot detail, things end up not being what they seem and Richard finds out a lot about himself, the way the world works and the frailty of the human condition when people are under stress. The ending is pessimistic as it tells us that there is no paradise - no promised land. Paradise is our normal lives at home with friends and family, with a job and a mundane life. Perhaps this is a truism - the grass is always greener right? I'm yet to decide.The bad things about the movie were few but noticeable. It can be a little confusing at times and could have done with more explanation of certain happenings. Viewing the cut scenes on the DVD helps and it's a shame they weren't included in the film as they helped. For example there's a scene were Richard is acting out the role of a computer game character. Although you see him playing computer games earlier in the movie, it would have been nice to have this part of his personality emphasized more so that the later scene had greater continuity. The director's commentary is highly enjoyable though - one of the best I've seen.Overall - a great movie that I'd recommend if you like your films with brains. A flawed classic.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
An unrewarding watch,"This felt like nothing but an immensely poorly executed trial at portraying the events and ideas in the book from which it was adapted into a film. 
In fact, despite the guiding narration throughout the film, it ends up being just a pile of hysterically nonsensical scenes and storylines that are more often than not leading the film into the middle of nowhere and ending abruptly without any explanations, with the point it wanted to make seemingly distant and faraway.
All in all, this film undoubtedly proved itself unworthy of even a one-time watch.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
A very good movie under many points of view,"This movie is a complex movie that joins action and philosophy.It makes you think about the consequences of a strict group of people leaving alone in their own context, and how the reality around can be dangerous. Also the danger can be inside the same group of people. Finally , that also inside an open-minded group of people some rules are necessary ... and that you can't be a real open-minded if the violence is part of your personality...It renders very well that type of craziness where a person can fall into when alone and not accepted by the community.Images are very beautiful, this movie is not boring, Di Caprio acts very good.Its a very recommended movie to see.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

One of the most under-appreciated films of the year 2000...,"In the spirit of Taoism and savage human transcendentalism comes one of the most under-appreciated films of the year 2000.The Beach is a visceral, elegant, and visually perfect adaptation of the critically acclaimed Alex Garland novel. Filmed on location in Thailand, The Beach places the final piece in Garland's nearly completed jigsaw: eye candy.The flawless settings of Thai surf and sand are undoubtedly one of the world's few treasures, and the vivid colors and sheer majesty of its pure paradise are amazingly captured by the filmmakers. Moreover, the beach in question is quite possibly one of the greatest settings ever used in a film. I still get chills just thinking about that tropic jewel of crystalline waterhow each tiny wave softly spills over white, powdery sand, all nestled underneath sundrenched palms and moss-covered rock.  Still, as a fair juxtaposition, the film also takes a concentrated look at the misery of urbanity, offering up clever images of mechanization, population, and capitalization. Great work by the crew, especially Darius Khonji, whose style you may recall from, and will see in future, David Fincher movies.It is at this point that The Beach marks its true power as a notable event in modern cinema. The movie, under the brilliant direction of Danny Boyle (Trainspotting), allows the audience to navigate between the vision of utopian paradise and the automated social lockbox in which most of us are destined to exist.As such, a true Taoist journey for personal freedom couples notions of anti-materialism at the core of this story. However, the picture also focuses on ruthless idealism, youthful curiosity, man's tragic quest for the unattainable, the moral sacrifice allotted to a hedonistic lifestyle, and man versus nature.If you enjoyed Fight Club, Lord of the Flies, Heart of Darkness, or Apocalypse Now, then watch this film tonight! It is an impressive blend of thrills, comedy, and adventure...seasoned with a discreet and gradual event that will catch you off-guard. I personally recommend the Special Edition DVD, as it is another treat delivered by Fox Home Video: aesthetic in design, bustling with deleted scenes, commentary, and other special features. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
I don't think so.,"The IMDb guidelines ask users, quite rightly, to refrain from gratuitously nasty comments.  I have to admit that, mildly speaking, I did not enjoy THE BEACH.  Suffice to say, the film's eagerness to adopt the DELIVERANCE/APOCALYPSE NOW/TAXI DRIVER mantle was compromised by its anti-septic, travel-brochure prettiness; that its megastar centrality resulted in play acting psychosis, rather than a disturbing embodiment (compare with Martin Sheen in APOCALYPSE NOW, for example); and that the film's fetishisation of youth's golden surface dazzles its professed aim of exploring its sinister undercurrents.

A highly underrated movie,"I am really shocked at the negative reviews this film has gotten over the years.

His pursuit of paradise leads him to an island where he discovers the perfect utopian society.The story moves along at a quick pace and is interwoven with some great internal monologues. The cinematography is amazing. The music soundtrack alone is reason enough to watch this movie.""The Beach"" depicts the ultimate fantasy of finding a private island paradise while enjoying the hedonistic lifestyle.

Danny Boyle has done a good job with the directing and the d.o.p. was really successful. However, I believe the novel version had more philosophical strength to it, and the film lacked the novel's interesting philosophy. As it's cinema, I guess it's an all right adaptation.

A complete mess. Probably Danny Boyle's worst film,"Danny Boyle is a very good directer but something went very wrong with 'The Beach'. The film is a complete mess. The story which is basically an updating of Lord of the Flies feels rather shallow. I never believed Leo's character and found (MINOR SPOILERS) his descent into madness ludicrous. The fault lies mainly with the script which is incoherent and ill-focused. There is some forced symbolism throughout the film.

Stunning Thailand captured by Boyle,The Beach gained notoriety as the first film Di Caprio made after becoming a worldwide phenomenon with Titanic. On its own merit how is the Beach?

Pretty bad but not horrible either,"I think this film is rather poor. I didn't like the soundtrack, it wasn't suitable and far too noticeable. I found the plot to be mediocre at best, but by far the worst part of the movie is the total lack of likeable characters. Except for the French guy I guess, all characters are utterly despicable with near to no redeeming qualities and they haven't been fleshed out that well. I can handle a film with unlikable characters and even love it sometimes, however in this film the other elements (plot, themes, fun) didn't counter this lack in well-developed or likeable characters.
The cinematography was ok I guess and the acting was actually really good, as can be expected from Leonardo di Caprio and Tilda Swinton. But they couldn't save the film in my opinion.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Paradise lost,"While attempting to be a dark and thoughtful film, The Beach simply struggles to find a voice and to be taken seriously. There are some good ideas about disasters in paradise (or paradise at a cost), but these ideas have similarly been done before. The film makes an effort, but it struggles to capture the characters and overall meaning. The only good thing about the film is the cinematography. If they had put more emphasis on the characters and used the cinematography to capture the characters' feelings more appropriately, then this would have been worth watching. Instead, it just loses itself in paradise and in the pretty cheesy events.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Strong contender for the worst movie of the decade! (so far!),"Believe me, even though I had heard nothing but negative feedback about 'The Beach' I watched it with an open mind. My taste is so at odds with 90% of the mainstream that if a movie receives such a violent reaction as this I generally regard that as a GOOD thing, thinking I might actually like it. My list of favourite movies of the last ten years features many more so-called ""bad"" movies than ""good"" ones. However this time I'm with the Blockbuster crowd - 'The Beach' is a genuine turkey! In fact it's the worst movie I've seen so far this decade, and that includes 'Hannibal', 'Zoolander', 'Tomb Raider', 'The 6th Day', and frankly way TOO many others to even think about!Now look I'm not even a DiCaprio hater (though after this I'm leaning that way!). I have studiously avoided watching 'Titanic', but I thought he was pretty good in 'This Boy's Life' opposite De Niro, and more than adequate in 'Gilbert Grape' and 'The Quick and the Dead'. I even thought his self-parodic cameo was the only good thing in Woody Allen's 'Celebrity'. But Leo is SO obnoxious and unsympathetic as Richard that from the word go you truly do not give a damn about what happens to him, especially as he shows himself to be just as much a loser as the tourists and backpackers he claims to be so different from.The plot has more holes than a Mafia Don's corpse, and is yet another ""searing inditement"" against the emptiness of Modern Life, that like 'Fight Club' wimps out at the end and has the rebel running back to the comforts of corporate America. Puh-lease! This ain't Nietsche for the New Millenium, it's Ferris Bueller for the Korn crowd.Director Danny Boyle showed so much promise with the taut thriller 'Shallow Grave' and the savvy junkie black comedy 'Trainspotting', but after giving us all a scare with the Godawful stupidity of 'A Life Less Ordinary' he has managed to top (or is that bottom?) himself with this embarassing stinker. Whether he will ever be able to redeem himself remains to be seen. The question is now, do we even care? I put myself through the torture of 'The Beach', but that could well be the limit of my endurance. Or maybe I'm just morbidly fascinated to see if Boyle is capable of making a movie WORSE than this. Is anybody??! I truly hope for all our sakes that the answer is no!",,Anonymous,Romance
"Flawed, But Better than the Hate Suggests","For starters it is a Danny Boyle film and that goes a long way, he is a great director...but Leo, oh Leo, you were miscast. That role was supposed to go to Ewan McGregor and had it kept the intended actor, it would have been a much different beast, and one far closer to the novel.Recasting Richard as an American, was in some cases, the biggest mistake. The insights he is supposed to deliver are more fragmented and make less sense coming from someone that isn't as close to Europe and the opportunities to experience the different cultures on a more regular basis.The book itself is about a traveler and American's hardly do that. Gen-X might, but that is about all, one Generation of hopeless wanderers since the Beat Movement.Still, despite the flaw it stands as a nice re-imagining, as a solid updated version of Thomas More's ""Utopia."" The monastery has been replaced with the commune. God with marijuana. The written correspondence with the internal monologue of a flawed protagonist. But the theme is the same. Utopia is no place. Void. It does not exist.And the movie does a good job of capturing the hope of a Utopian offer and then revealing the truth behind that veil.Had the casting been right, and not to say that DiCaprio isn't a great actor in his own right, but had the role of Richard been filled with the actor best suited for it, the film would have worked on a fundamentally brilliant level on par with Garland's source material.Still, DiCaprio is a competent actor and he did his best despite the fact the role was wrong for him. The faults are small, but for some not easily over looked.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The only good thing about the film is Virginie Ledoyen,"The only good thing about the film is Virginie Ledoyen. Unfortunately, there is not enough of her in this film to make it better. She has a wonderful on screen presence and charm and I hope she will continue to make English language films. But, good ones.Her french colleague Guillaume Canet plays his part well and naturally. DiCaprio, on the other hand, tries just a little too hard. Meaning, his character is a bit over cooked, over acted, and just simply over done.Boyle makes a poor showing as well. A lousy screen play, made from a good book. The story is choppy. Boyles' attempt to blend the film with his style (think video game scene for example) was completely unnecessary. Which, by the way, made DiCparo's character even less believable. In short, its a pretty bad film.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Excellent...,"The Beach is one of the most visceral movies I have ever seen. It touches an innate and deep sense of something personal inside of all of us. The sense and perception of paradise lost.

Not to mention the rest of the movie is an oasis of the mind. Empathize with the characters, imagine yourself there with them. Smoke some gr$$n if you have to, but watch out, this movie is very intense. At least I believe so.Other movies that I would recommend for the open-minded individual would be as follows:1) Zardoz 2) I *heart* Huckabees 3) Requiem For A Dream 4) Hackers*Warning* Zardoz is for the very open-minded. *wink *wink lol",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
This tropical adventure achieves practically nothing,"Watching the Beach is like looking at a postcard from a tropical island: it is a pretty picture, but it is also paper thin, and nothing happens in it.This motion picture left me disappointed. It starts off promisingly, but with each passing chapter (sometimes pair of chapters) the story grows more dull. The editing is clunky, the script is underwritten, the acting is more wooden than the trunk of a palm tree, and the ending is rushed and anti-climactic. The only thing this motion picture really has to sell are a handful of nice shots and a good score.Judging by the sloppiness of the story telling, it is clear that The Beach is definitely one of those book adapted movies that butchered its source material. It is a story that could've amounted to so much more. There is too much narration and not enough intelligent dialogue, and every now and then, just when you think the film is becoming something good, it changes again. Individual scenes work well on their own, but not in the context of the whole story. Take for instance a love scene between Leo Dicaprio and the french girl he invites on his trip to a lost paradise in the South Pacific. It's a well directed charming little sequence, but unfortunately, that particular character relationship ends with the scene.Another problem with the Beach is that it requires a strong compelling lead, which it does not have. Perhaps Leo was just too inexperienced as an actor at the time. The character feels like a nobody, and his persona is sold to us almost entirely through his narrative monologues which feature pretty scrappy lines of dialogue.In the end, the Beach sets out with ambition but the trip is unsatisfying. It is weak and ineffective, and if it does nothing else, at least it will remind you of how far both Leo and director Danny Boyle have come since this.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Something Deep And Meaningful In This Master Piece,"There is so much I can say about this film. The first time I watched it when I was 11 I thought it was a mediocre film, worth the watch but wasn't anything too great.I then hadn't watched it for about 5 years or so, I saw it in a shop and decided to buy it (fan of Leonardo Dicaprio).To my surprise, I saw a quality about this film which is why it ranks in at my third favourite film of all time, even though it is so unbearably underrated.It shows how total paradise can even be turned upside down. It has a lot of quotes that can be used in every day life to spice it up. If you take detail to everything that is said and shown you will find an art within it.-SPOILER- For example, when Richard is telling the story of his defeat over the shark, when he screams ""NO! I WILL NOT DIE TODAY"" you get an overpowered surge as part of nature to survive.-SPOILERS END HERE- A magnificent film. Truly original and fresh.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Read the novel, it's a lot better then the film","What could have gone wrong with The Beach? It was based on a popular, critically acclaimed novel, starred Leonardo Di Caprio, who was considered one of the world's biggest stars after Romeo + Juliet and Titanic and was directed by Danny Boyle who had won plaudits for Shallow Grave and the excellent Trainspotting. Well, many things, but at least Di Caprio and Boyle were able to bound back with great success.Richard (Di Caprio) was an American traveller, landing in Bangkok, the starting point for many travellers going to South-East Asia. He goes to Thailand because he wants adventure and tries to avoid the usual tourist route. On his first day a mad Scotsman, Daffy Duck (Robert Carlyle), kills himself and leaves him a map to a small island with a legendary beach and lagoon. Richard befriends a young French couple, Françoise (Virginie Ledoyen) and Étienne (Guillaume Canet) and the two make their way onto the island. After a dangerous journey the three discover a commune of travellers, including the leader Sal (Tilda Swinton), her boyfriend Bugs (Lars Arentz-Hansen) and Keaty (Paterson Joseph), a Christian and a cricket fanatic. Life on the beach seems perfect, there is work to do but plenty of time to relax and to Richard it was what he wanted, a place away from the usual traveller crowd. But there are threats, the cannabis farmers who control the rest of the island, shark attacks whilst fishing and Richard's secret of giving the map to two surfers, Sammy and Zeph (Jerry Swindall and Peter Youngblood Hills). But Richard got what he wanted: adventure.The main problem was that The Beach was too disloyal to original novel. There are minor things that were agreeable, like changing Richard's and Sal's appearance, maybe changing Sal from American to British. But most others did not work. One of the main things that affected the film was changing Richard from being English into an American and well the film suffers because of it. Some scenes like when Richard meets the surfers loose their impact, mainly because in the book the surfers pretend to be a stupid cliché and both are actually very smart, but in the film they are both well, a stupid cliché. We don't get to see how Richard's mind ticks, like his obsession with Vietnam war movies, he personal reasons for travelling and his dreams with Daffy. Other elements that ruined the film include cutting the character Jed from the novel, who was an important character, befriending Richard and acts at the beach's protector and an outsider to the community. Even if the character had to be cut his characteristics could have been implanted into someone else like Keaty. The film also skips over other story elements that drive the plot, like the food poisoning and how that led to a conflict between two camps within the community.Acting wise the film does have some decent performances, like from the French actors Canat and Ledoyen and Swinton (who is normally a good actress). But it was Joseph who was the best of the cast, having excellent comic timing, even if his character was changed. But for Di Caprio this was one of his weakest performances. He was sadly quite wooden in the role and he just shouted a lot. We did not get to truly see why Richard was so excited about the prospect of adventure and it just felt hollowing, going through the motions. The actors who played the surfers were also noteworthy for weak performances.The novel was very organic in its plotting, feeling real, even at times it did feel a little slow. But in the screenplay and the director the film felt like it wanted to rush through everything, taking away some of the natural nature of the book. A great example of this was how Richard invited Étienne and Françoise on the trips and their basic plans: there was no realism behind it.There are some positives to the film. Boyle was able to add a little style into the film with some camera and editing tricks, like the camera going back quickly to reveal the waterfall and there are moments of tension and action with the cannabis farmers. Boyle also got the sense of the beach's hypnotic affects, making people forget about the outside word. There are also moments of comedy like when Keaty explains the rules of cricket. Boyle get the sense of what makes some travellers think, wanting to explore, party and partake in the local culture. It shows that Thailand has become very Westernised and that travellers are looking for the next big place before it is discovered and flooded by Westerners. I feel the same, I go on holiday to avoid English-people and I want to experience the local culture. Plus there is a good soundtrack, with the only good song by Moby as the signature track of the film. And there is some excellent cinematography and beautiful scenery throughout the film.At Di Caprio was able to make Catch Me if You Can and Gangs of New York to kickstart his career after two flops (The Beach and The Man in the Iron Man). Boyle also somehow made friends with Alex Garland, the author of The Beach (which is very surprising) and two were able make 28 Days Later and Sunshine. So The Beach was not all doom and groom.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

Even more boring than beaches usually,"This is one of the least interesting films I have never seen. The plot is astonishingly uninspired: a half-witted attempt to modernize childrens' adventure stories for today's teenagers, with a hasty twist pilfer from the Lord of the Flies and the most cumbersomely laid out love triangle in movie history. All characters in the movie are not only one-dimensional, but that dimension consists solely of being an utterly unlikable monkey. And pray tell, what possible purpose the stale narrator's voice is supposed serve?I would say that the first half of the movie was majestetically boring, although that leaves me no means of describing the second half, and my only positive thought considering this picture was ""thank God I never saw this at the movies"". But hey, that's only because my image of paradise does not consist of pot, beach and Leonardo DiCaprio acting out his second least ambitious role, so obviously I am not this film's target audience. 2/10",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

How does this have a 6.8?! Read the book!,"Leo is one of my favorite actors, so when I found out that one of my favorite books by Alex Garland (writer/director of Ex Machina, one of the best movies ever made, Devs, Annihilation, etc.) was made with an awesome cast including Tilda Swinton & my boy Leo, I couldn't wait until the evening so I could watch it. Wow...what a MAJOR disappointment.I know its tough to compare books and movies for many reasons, but I've read over the years dozens of books that were turned into movies and I can honestly say that this one surpassed World War Z as the worst/most unfaithful adaptation of a book into a movie I've ever seen. Not only are major characters (Jed) just flat out eliminated, but the entire spirit of the last 3/4 of the book are lost! Etienne, Richard, and Francoise remain best of friends throughout the books and the sexual tension between R & F is never acted on besides a long kiss on the cheek when she's violently ill, and in this train wreck of a movie they become a couple minutes after arriving at the island.I could write an essay about all the reasons why this is nothing like a great book that everyone should read, but even without the source material, this movie was just flat out terrible. Every character turned into an unlikable cliche, a movie without purpose or meaning. Wtf was up with that video game sequence too, just please don't watch this movie unless its to hate watch it.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
what a great movie,"this movie was released in 2000 and i watched it only in 2002. I took that time because i heard people saying it was not a good movie. I completely disagree and it is my favorite movie ever. The idea behind it is unusual and different from the argument of loads of other movies. The cast is brilliant, the scenario is too beautiful and i keep thinking about ""I still believe in Paradise, but now I know its not some place you can look for, its not where you go, but how you feel for a moment in your life, and if you find that moment it lasts forever!""..don't understand how people can not quote this movie as one of the greatest movies ever.

annoying airplane music,"This movie reminded me on the type of movies from the 80ths. Something around the ""Dirty dancing"" era. Maybe that happened because of the permanent annoying music in the background, sometimes not background... It distracts from understand what people say, distracts from own thinking, distracts from getting a feeling for the film or be with the characters. I found it very flat although the book or the plot would have had enough substance to make it more interesting or deeper. There would have been enough moments to take the chance for thinking what Island life means or what relationship means but instead they were playing that crazy music over and over the whole movie.

A great escape,"The Beach is my favourite movie of all time.

Add to that the beautiful romance between him and Virginie, and you have the perfect story.

The performances are delivered with acceptability, the scenery is incredible, and the story, well, close you mind for a few minutes and it is believable.

At least Hollywood High knew it was just an excuse to show some nudity (it was however mistaken in thinking it was a comedy). I digress. The point being that The Beach had no idea what it wanted to be. Is it a love story, and adventure, a psychological drama, a drama... who knows. Every time it seemed like it had finally made up it's mind the story line would change and ramble incoherently in another direction. I was speechless after watching it. I demand 2 hours of my life back, ok I know I can't get it but how about an apology for wasting my time (and my $ back if it isn't too much trouble).

Great film with a brilliant story!,"Though I do prefer the novel for The Beach, I quite enjoyed the film as well. It was a mistake to hype it as a blockbuster return for DiCaprio, though, as it has the feel of an indie movie, which I prefer.The lead character, Richard, is someone we can all identify with. And we see a wide range of emotions, from adventurous to bordering on insanity, romance to fear. And DiCaprio pulls it off with ease. Definitely in his proper place doing a darker character with plenty of twists and turns.Viginie Ledoyen was excellent as Francoise. I look forward to seeing more of her work.The direction was excellent, and the cinematography breathtaking!After seeing footage of what the beach they filmed on looked like originally, and comparing it to how it looked once they were done, I would think the Thai's would be happy! It was littered and obviously uncared for prior to all the hard work this team put into it.If you are into movies with great story, interesting characters, and not all the Hollywood hoopla, this is your movie!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Ignore the critics--this is a good film!,"Critics didn't like this film. Roger Ebert, whose reviews I generally find insightful and on target, gave it just 2 stars and called it ""seriously confused"". On the IMDB hit parade, it only rates about 6 stars. Because of this, I didn't go and see it at the theatre, and have been ambivalent about renting the video, even though I like DiCaprio's work, and admired Danny Boyle's previous ""Trainspotting"". Then my teenage daughter came home from a party where she and her friends had watched it, and she said, ""It's brilliant! You HAVE to see it, Mum!""So, we rented the video, and I'm glad we did. The Beach is an interesting and solid film that tells an intriguing, if somewhat episodic, story in a stylish way. DiCaprio is, indeed, excellent as a young man searching for life's ultimate experiences, and getting more than he bargained for. This is a loss-of-innocence story, a sort of cross between Lord of the Flies, Apocalypse Now, and the musical The Fantastics. Director Danny Boyle leads us on Richard's journey to the Heart of Darkness in an energetic, stylish way--filming is interesting and beautiful--and he gets excellent results from his actors. The use of Richard's voice-over as narrative--often a distraction in films--here offers a certain amount of adolescent profundity and acuteness of observation, and it works.I've been a traveller in Thailand. Although Richard's quest and Richard's scene wasn't mine, I've seen it...the beaches, the bars, the snake blood, the dope, the parties. I've also been a high school teacher, and have worked with adolescents hungry to discover ""the real world"", to bite into Eve's apple with gusto. Many from New Zealand head off in their late teens/early twenties on ""The Great OE"" (Overseas Experience). The same is undoubtedly true for many Australians and Brits, if not so commonly for American youth. So there's a strong element of ""truth"" in this story.Don't listen to the critics. This is a good, solid film with an interesting perceptive story, fine performances, and a stylish presentation. Four stars out of five.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Everything was great about this movie except the ending which could be much better.

"Re: actor Guillaume Canet comparison to Patrick Dempsey""???","Maybe I have been hidden in a dark hole since this movie came out in 2000/01, but I have never heard of it or saw it until it came on the Bravo channel on television tonight. While I was watching it, I saw an actor who I thought was Patrick Dempsey. I asked my husband to come and see, but of course he has to look everything up on the internet, first of all to find out the name of the movie, then he tells me that it is not Patrick Dempsey it is a French actor named Guillaume Canet, playing the character of Etinne. I still believe the French actor, ""Guillaume Canet"" is Patrick Dempsey (alias Dr. McDreamy). If not, Canet must be Dempsey's long lost/adopted out/identical twin brother. As soon as I saw him on the screen, I thought, oh so this was Dempsey's acting gig between the 80's and the Lifetime mini-series ""A Weekend in Pregatory"", before his big break with Grey's Anatomy. I can't be the only person that thinks Canet & Dempsey are one in the same or at least his identical twin brother!!! Once I saw this, it was hard for me to get into the movie except for some of Leo's ""Richard's"" scenes, especially the scene where Richard is having his nervous break down and actually sees three American tourist murdered in the marijuana field and then he starts running for his own life, which brought him somewhat semi-back as much as possible, to reality afterwards. If you agree, about the Dempsey/Canet theory let me know, even if I am five or six years late!!!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A waste of a great story.,"When I learned that they were going to make a film based on Garland's bestselling novel, I was slightly worried.

Read the book and don't bother with this film!,"Fortunately for myself I read Alex Garland's novel prior to watching this film and having done so I am grateful that it was not the other way round. The scriptwriters for some reason decided to only loosely base the events of the novel into the film and as a result this comes across as a rushed and poorly directed piece of work.What immediately springs to mind is the main character Richard, who is portrayed not as the stereotypical English traveller that is intended by Alex Garland but by the fresh faced American Leonardo Di Caprio who it seems never has a hair out of place in the entire course of the film. But what most annoys me about this movie is the complete omission of Jed, a pivotal character in the novel who is for some bizarre reason expelled from the script.So many aspects of the film lack the novels breathtaking tempo, and the detailed descriptions that can only be put across in a book fail to come through in the screenplay. All in all this film is exactly what Alex Garland was looking to avoid when writing in the sense that it is pure Hollywood, with none of the characters coming through as believable people in the context of the situation they find themselves.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

Could have been so much better!,"With talented Director Danny Boyle calling the shots, with a best selling novel as material, and with arguably Hollywood's biggest star Leonardo Di Caprio as the lead, you'd be forgiven for expecting The Beach to be something a bit special.I expected one of the films of the year. I left disappointed.I should point out right away that I did read Garland's novel months earlier, and being a huge fan, it's quite hard to judge Boyle's film merely as a film. Making comparisons between film and book was almost impossible, so if faced with the choice between the two, I would recommend watching the film first.To be fair, those experiencing the story for the first time through Boyle's film will probably find it quite entertaining. Certainly no classic, but watchable nonetheless, with some decent performances headed by Di Caprio, and some beautiful filming.Fans of the novel though should prepare to be disappointed. The story is no where near as intriguing, several good supporting characters are left to just fade into the tropical background, and the actions of those who do hog all the camera time aren't true to Garland's excellent novel.The most annoying example of this is Richard's eventual madness. While the novel has Richard's fears and suspicions of his apparent paradise developed gradually, Boyle has Richard seemingly fine and content one minute, and raving mad the next.In addition, Richard's unrequited love for Francoise, the cause of some interesting, silent, sexual tension in the novel, is replaced by a passionate love triangle. Not content, with just this, Boyle decides to completely change Garland's story by adding a slight change to the ending.As I said earlier, those unfamiliar with the story will probably enjoy the Beach, with it offering some simple, escapist entertainment with some sex appeal.Garland fans won't be able to help feeling a little disappointed. This is a lazily constructed, loosely based adaptation, saved only by some half decent performances, some wonderful cinematography, and the obvious appeal of a bikini clad Virginie Ledoyen.Not terrible, but a sad case of wasted potential.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

mediocre,"When I went to see ""The Beach"" I did so rather curiously than with high expectations, though it was the latest work of Boyle, Hodge and Macdonald. There were so many negative headlines surrounding the picture (the -according to the press- disastrous shootings in Thailand and Ewan McGregor going public with his disappointment about his friends jumping ship on him when they decided to give Leo the leading role), that I was just wondering if the film would reflect all this. First of all is the story basically interesting: the protagonists look for new excitement in their life and try to redeem themselves from the boredom of life in a society, which can't offer them new perspectives (a story element which had been described in Finchers ""Fight Club"" before). In the first half, ""The Beach"" is a decent film: you really get a sense for this alternative society and lifestyle thanks to Boyles understatement. Darius Khondjis cinematography is -as always- most impressive. The crux is the sudden change in the second part of the film: Since we haven't been given any clues before about the dark side of Richards character, this change in his personality and therefore the change in the tone of the picture comes the more unexpected and not plausible. There's a reference to ""Apocalypse Now"" but since the film leaves it to that, this storytwist simply doesn't work at all. I haven't read Garlands novel but since Hodge admitted to have shortened the plot (running time and so on..)I just suppose that the novel goes far more into details about Richard's innerlife and gives you a better preparation for what is to come. Moreover Boyles stylistic methods are inappropriate for the climax of the story: the video game references are ludicrous as basically the second part as a whole is strangely uninvolving. The result is a film, which -as ""Fight Club""- starts off in style but then derails terribly in the end. Truly, you recognize it as Danny Boyles film and not as Fox's picture, but despite that I hope that the trio comes back to Britain and make again the good films they became famous for (""Shallow Grave"" and in parts ""Trainspotting"").",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Potentially Interesting Theme,"""I settled in and found my vocation--the pursuit of pleasure,"" shares Leonardo DiCaprio's Richard, shortly after arriving at his dream vacation spot: ""the beach.""  The trouble with this thesis is it is ultmiately an unsatisfying goal.  Vacations and parties must end sometime, and work begin.As surely as human nature seems to require both projects and play in equal measure, life skewed toward recreation alone is bound to become a boring and unfulfilling existence.  This state can lead to dire consequences and may even point the way toward tragedy. Novelist Alex Garland and writing assistant John Hodge try to depict this in a quite dramatic screenplay.   Somewhere along the way, however, the essential theme got lost, and one may leave a viewing of ""The Beach"" wondering what was its actual purpose.       Deleted scenes included in the DVD format surprisingly help to clarify some thematic features missing from the finished narrative.  Likewise, key character profiles, like those of Robert Carlyle's Daffy gain better understanding through these cut scenes.       As the writers' objectives seem basically sincere, it's too bad this narrative fails in its loftier expressive aims.  Utlizing inherent creative urges appear an important aspect of our satisfaction, and that encompasses a good deal more than what ""the beach"" alone can ever provide.  ###",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Personally i think that Leo should have won his Emmy in whats eating gilbert grape? or even basketball diaries... hes such a strong actor who is often overlooked due to his young age and boyish charm. All i can say is give him what belongs to him.... Wheres Arnnie?!?!? not at the Emmy's that much i can say.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Better than the 'hype', marginally","I haven't read the book. I haven't backpacked Asia. I don't believe DiCaprio is talentless (or a new force in acting). I'd forgotten who directed it until the credits. And, I prefer taking my own views.So, some time after the bad press dies down I watch it.  All going well, restless youth/Youth -> wide-world -> interesting Carlisle cameo (brilliant acting although this new Begbie should have reminded me of the Director). The story gathered a little pace and more interest and then...Not too sure.  Was it written this way?  We're they given two days notice to finish the film, only half way through the film?  The video arcade 'game'? The lack of plausible reason for DiCaprio losing his senses? The inconsistent moral structure in the troup.Rent the film.

"#$% the critics, this movie is good","Although burnt down by critics here in Holland, I really liked this movie.The movie never ceased to amuse me with one of the climaxes being the videogame sequence.

Go see it is absolutely fabulous",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
I'll take sand in my shorts over watching this mess again,"The Beach: Every backpacker is in search of untouched paradise, that one place that would make every postcard vendor salivate. Unfortunately, anyplace that remotely fits the bill is usually overrun with drunken revelers, package tourists and golden arches.  When Richard, a jaded traveler, acquires a map with the location of a secret pristine beach he is determined to find it, regardless the risks.  Which begs the question, what is the price of paradise?Since Titanic Di Caprio has been damned, dismissed and denigrated.  His detractors have obviously forgotten his performances in What's Eating Gilbert Grape and Romeo and Juliet.  Di Caprio deserves to be judged on his individual efforts and not prejudged for having been in a blockbuster. That said, he is horrible in this movie.  Or to be more accurate, this film as a whole is terrible.Beach attempts to be a fusion of Apocalypse Now and Lord of the Flies, only a lite version without the drama, irony, or introspection. The story is for the most part a sanitized, predictable muddled mess, except for the last 20 minutes, which are exceptionally outlandish -Richard's bouts with madness are laughable.   The commune consists of a bunch of elitist spoiled brats who live in tense harmony with a band of pot growers (given that drug growing and smuggling are capital offences in Thailand I'm sure this sort of thing happens all the time) until things go wrong.  Big surprise.  Finally, although the star of the movie is beautiful (I'm talking the beach here), it is not worth the price of admission.Miss.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
DiCaprio isn't just another pretty face.,"I enjoyed Leonardo DiCaprio in What's Eating Gilbert Grape, and then lost faith in him after Titanic.  I was sick of the whole teen heartthrob/posse-towing bad boy image.  But The Beach put Leonardo back in my good books. If you enjoyed Trainspotting, chances are you'll like The Beach, from the same power team that gave us the Scottish heroin romp. This time it's an isolated island paradise instead of Scotland, pot instead of heroin, and Leonardo DiCaprio instead of Ewan MacGregor. The Beach is a visually stunning movie with a soundtrack that blended seamlessly with the beautiful visuals.  The acting was incredible, with not one single disappointing performance.  The movie was both funny (the video game sequence) and scary (the shark attack), just as much of a nightmare as it was a beautiful dream. With any luck we will start seeing Leonardo DiCaprio in more roles that portray him as more than just your average pretty boy, because it's once again obvious that he's a fantastic actor.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Left on ""The Beach"": the nerves of the viewers","It´s hard do believe that the british director Danny Boyle, who surprised us with ""Shallow Grave"" and ""Trainspotting"" made this horrible film. The story, if there is one, is a disgusting mixture of ""Apocalypse now"", ""The Jaw"", ""Lord of the Flies"" and holiday impressions from Thailand. Although I have never been to this country it´s very difficult to understand why Boyle is unable not to speak and to show pictures that are full of clichés. Above all the performance of Di Caprio is nothing special and so does the rest of the crew. ""The Beach"" is a waste of time because Boyle never show really interest in his characters or in his storyline. And for all people who where eager to see Di Caprio in his first movie after TITANIC will be surely disappointed. I was and I´m sure you will too. So Mr. Boyle - one good advice to you: Go back to Europe and make again films like ""Trainspotting"" and ""Shallow Grave"". The Audience will be pleased. And one advice to the us-public: save your money for better films!",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Highly disapointed.,"Was expecting something much better. I am very disapointed especially with Leonardo DiCaprio who is a legend.Pros:
Surprisingly good quality for a 2000's movie.Leonardo Dicaprio's acting is good.Cons:
Painfully boring film.It is very hard to understand what most of the characters are saying. (I had to put subtitles on.)
It is not thrilling.It is not in any way; good.Overrated. (I don't know how it got a 6.6/10)

Good film,"I see that this film had the worst reviews the time it came out, but since i have this habit of liking some films even if they had bad reviews, i went onto check out this one....and I'm glad i did that.I had read the book, so that was one reason i decided to check this out as well...Though it should be admitted that the story was altered a bit here and there..the film is fun to watch. Some characters are missing and the end is somewhat different too and Richard's affair with Francoise is more open in the movie. But you wouldn't get the fabulous photography or the wonderful soundtrack on the book r8...So i guess its worth it. Plus there are some extras available on the DVD like an alternate beginning and ending and some deleted scenes, story boards etc...As for the movie...its fun to watch, maybe it gets a bit dull towards the 'Richard in the jungle' part, which is a bit too complex in the book too i guess...

"Not a Beach Party film afterall, but it wasn't meant to be.","What did you expect...?  Well, you have this young man who is on a ""journey"" and along the way, he ends up in a tree....  So, he put himself there along with his traveling companions and the people he meets.  Well, he has to undergo a transformation of character ... blah, blah, blah ... hopefully for the better, and resolve the situation  so that he can continue his journey as a somewhat enlightened or changed person.  Well, I guess this film was a little ""Greek"" to most of the reviewers and probably to many of the ""male"" members of the audience so far.  Though, it seems that most of the young women that have seen the film have picked up on the subtle nuances of Richard's story.  Well, maybe not, could be just a subconscious thing going here with Leo.  However, the film is not as bad as all that.  It says a lot about pop culture and Western influence spreading to every remote corner of the world.  Including Westerners, who have gone to the remote corners to escape their own cultural imperialism.   But, you can't run away from yourself....or your culture... or ..whatever.  Anyway ... in some primitive ways the natives still rule in a primitive society.I liked the hommage to APOCALYPSE NOW.  It is one of my favorite films. I think you could throw in a little LORD OF THE FLIES here too.   I liked the way that the film showed the influence of Consumer Technology in Southeast Asia, where of course, most of the products are manufactured today.  ""Poor Richard"" just couldn't get away from it all....the music, images, tourists, etc. were everywhere.  Well, if he wasn't staying at The Admiral Ben Bow Inn, he wouldn't have gotten the treasure map.  He almost got the black spot near  the end too ... but you can't kill off the young hero .. he has to complete his journey or undergo a change ... I think I covered this already. I liked the bit where he spaced out and imagined himself as a character in a computer game. Also, I thought that it was a very nice touch at the end, where he logged on and received the photo that represented a brief moment of paradise in the universe.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A paradise built at the cost of unacceptable sacrifices.,"The script tells the story of a tourist from the USA who goes to Thailand and hears about a paradisiacal beach, hidden from tourism. The atmosphere of secrecy around the beach leads him to look for the place. There, he finds a group of youngsters living under the cover of a fragile agreement with a drug cartel set up nearby, and determined not to let their own paradise to be violated by hordes of tourists. The situation turns out to be very tense, both with drug traffickers and among themselves, and everything seems to indicate that there will be a major conflict soon. The film works very well the relationship problems between the characters, creating an intense plot where suspense builds up very slowly until the end.Capitalizing on the success of ""Titanic"", Leonardo DiCaprio is the protagonist and is paid handsomely for this work which, incidentally, brings nothing new or challenging to his career. It seems that the actor just chose this job because of what he would earn. Still, he meet the basics, without surprises or major merits. Tilda Swinton is much more impactful, offering us a great work, with impact and presence. She is not an actress that I especially like, but, despite that, I am the first to praise the talent and enormous capacity of this lady. The film also features an interesting work from Guillaume Canet and Virginie Ledoyen.Technically, the film looks incredible: the photography does a lot for the visuals, with light and color artfully crafted in order to highlight the paradisiacal look of the place; The sets were also designed to introduce the audience to a place that promises a dream vacation. The soundtrack, I confess, didn't catch my attention. Unfortunately, I am forced to deeply regret the awfull production sense of responsability: after all, they have caused an almost irreparably damage to that Thai beach location and its entire ecosystem. Despite how long it has been, that place has not yet recovered from the damage caused, which is shocking. And that's why I understand completely that Thai people hate this film, even for the representation of their country as a heaven of hedonistic pleasures and drugs, with violence and brutality hidden under the carpets.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

On top, everyone who traveled for quite some time in South-East-Asia will smile here and there because the movie really shows some aspects of travelling as a backpacker there (if you want or have to travel really cheap) and captures the mood well, especially if you dare to go deeper into the more rural and more backward regions and into the pits of the big cities like Bangkok.Anyway good acting, fine cinematography and a sometimes thrilling story make The Beach an indeed sometimes pleasant trip and sometimes nightmare strikes back.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Failed Mix of Slice of Life and Thriller,"Leonardo DiCaprio is a fantastic actor, and his performance is one of only two redeeming features of this movie. He brings his legendary passion to a character that feels alive, brimming with primal emotion and instinct.Secondly the locations are beautiful, with many memorable vistas lit up by gorgeous sunlight.However the rest of the film is a completely botched waste of ideas loaded with pointless exposition; with a darkness that has no follow through.Lacking any true direction of what it wanted to be, and you are left with bits and pieces of what could have been a thought provoking thriller.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Definitely one of the most underrated movies out there!,"I can't really remember when I saw The Beach for the first time, it was probably some time after it's release, 2000-2002. I remember though that most people didn't think too highly of this movie, which in a way, kind of bummed me out. I guess the majority of film viewers don't really feel like opening their minds too much, they just want something easy and then 2 hours later they go on with their lives. And with a film like this, that doesn't really work out. You have to give it some time and keep your mind open for incoming ideas. It's very philosophical in a way, which actually is one of the greatest things about it.With time as I saw this movie once and once, here and there, I started noticing all the little things in this movie that really make it what it is; an outstanding example of excellent film-making. This movie takes you somewhere else... which in my opinion is a big point in film-making.People who tend to glue themselves to the ground, over-analyzing details every step of the way; might not find this movie as rewarding as people who give in to every emotion that comes along the way.The story follows the adventure of Richard, an American(the only two things we know about him) who's on his great journey to experience something unique.. something else than what is to be found in his everyday life. He eventually hooks up with two Europeans after he hears about this magical island, a paradise island covered with white sand and surrounded by crystal clear ocean. Without going into the plot more thoroughly I'll say that what struck me so hard about this movie is that, like said in the movie; that paradise is not a place you find or a somewhere you just go to. It's something you'll only find in time while exploring the abundance of landscapes, cultures, societies and of course all the visually stunning wonders of our world. It might not last long, maybe not even a second, but if you'll ever get there.. you'll remember it as long as you live. And our little protagonist is willing to go great lengths to reach that moment, even if there's the chance of death. Once in a place of purity, freedom and never-ending euphoria the character finds that there is a thin line between paradise and hell. How such beautiful places can so swiftly take away your sanity.I'll say that I haven't yet had the courage to embark on such a great trip yet, I intend to. But meanwhile, this movie successfully takes me to that place of paradise where every problem just goes away. The soundtrack to this movie, combined with stunning cinematography is just something that makes you forget everything and sucks you into this world of perfection, where even the most lustrous shores can evenly be paralleled by hell.Give this movie a shot and just use your imagination for a while. I watch this movie probably several times a year and it's one of those movies that just soothes me down.I give this movie a 9 because it exceeded my expectations by far and gives me everything I expect from it. It fulfills it's role perfectly. Highly recommendable to anyone longing to travel the world, just to see something new.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Excellent location, Richard, Françoise and Etienne","Those which have read the book should agree that the island described in Alex's Garland novel is exactly the same as that on the movie, as well as all of the characters.  The film though very interesting on the first 2 thirds, becomes a bit boring on the last one.  The film should have given more detail on each of the characters, specially on those as important as Jed, who doesn't appear on the movie, Sal, Bugs and Keaty, and their relation with the rest of the comunity of the beach. The cast is very full filling specially CiCaprio's realism and Ledoyen's appearance of strength and vulnerability.  I think that the movie should have kept loyal to the novel and do not invent part of the happenings while they ignored some very important (like the three with the inscriptions next to the waterfall or the continuous visions richard has of Daffy.

For the wandering type,"Although this film has been trashed terribly, there are some of us who actually really liked this film.Maybe it's the traveller in me, but this film about the search to find, and create the ultimate paradise, is actually quite affecting. From personal experience, I find the colony of backpackers that live in the Beach community to be very realistic. I've met these people! Di Caprio is actually quite good as a frat boy kind of American and Swinton is great as the community's dictatorial leader.Don't see this film expecting a repeat of the book. Few films are as good as the book, we all know that. But for those of you with a traveller's heart and for those of you who dream of finding the perfect paradise, I'd say this film is an exotic and refreshing and worth your time.Sure there are some parts, like the video-game sequence where Richard goes all Lord of the Flies that is a bit ridiculous.

Nothing (much) new under the sun,"Leo di Caprio flaunts his hairless chest, eats a caterpillar and goes nuts on a tropical island. The End.This film about a dope-fuelled utopia hidden on a remote tropical isle off Thailand could have been much better. The first half is strong, and seems to follow a strong theme of travelling in hope being better than arriving. Robert Carlyle puts in a good but brief role as the crazed Daffy. Once the story arrives at the legendary beach, the film gradually unravels. Di Caprio may be a charismatic screen presence, but he doesn't have the acting ability to bring the story to life. The sequence in the jungle where he loses his marbles is particularly weak. Tilda Swinton, who is one of but a few reasons to watch this film, acts rings around him.Bits of the film evoke other movies such as Apocalypse Now, Dr Strangelove and Lord of the Flies. This would appear to follow the book on which this film is based, in which the central character is obsessed with films and video games. This works okay in novels, where it is possible to transplant things from other media to fertilise a story, but if it's not done right (and it is not done right here) it only makes the film appear derivative. The novel ""The Beach"" was popular and very successful and this film would appear to be a sub-standard adaptation.

This movie can't decide what it wants to be about,"'The beach' has really left me with mixed feelings. I wanted to hate the movie because Leonardo diCaprio plays in it, but in spite of his presence, The Beach is not as bad as I expected. One thing that's remarkable is that Leo's character is kind of a jerk, which is a welcome change from the one-dimensional idiot he played in 'Titanic'The first half hour of the movie is terrible, however. Corny dialogs, stereotype tourist character and an annoying voice-over. After that, the movie gets a little better, especially the scenery (the tropical island) is breathtaking, and the movie even manages to be funny sometimes. Plus, there is a certain charm in the idea of a hippy commune living on a beautiful, deserted island.Unfortunately, the movie can't decide what it wants to be: an action movie, a romantic drama, a satire on the consumer society, a 'Blue Lagoon'- clone etc. It contains parts of all these movies/genres, but it moves constantly from one genre to the other.All in all, I found the Beach to be moderately enjoyable, mostly because I just wanted to see what happened next, even though that what happened usually didn't make much sense. with a LOT more focus on psychology, the Beach would have been a good movie. As it is now, it's confusing and a little boring, but not total crap*1/2 out of **** stars",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Noir Bizarre,"Leonardo DiCaprio must have been very desperate for an antihero role to agree to this turkey of a script.  No amount of camera magic by Danny Boyle or idyllic locations could save this dreadful story.  It spasmodically progresses from implausible, to inconceivable and finally to demented.  It is Fantasy Island' meets Apocalypse Now'.  The only way to classify it would be Noir Bizarre.John Hodge and Danny Boyle team up to prove that one success in avant-garde filmmaking (Trainspotting) does not necessarily spill over into future projects, though I must say that Boyle's direction was the only thing that kept this film from being a total disaster.  His brilliant camerawork and cinematography helped keep my mind off the peculiar and disjointed content.As far as the acting goes, this was The Leonardo DiCaprio Show.  Though there were additional characters in the film, other than a cameo by Robert Carlyle they were the equivalent of extras that had been elevated to speaking parts.  DiCaprio gave a good performance, but his character was so mercurial that it is hard to say he really nailed it.  He ran around with his shirt off a lot, so I guess that will keep the teenyboppers happy.I rated this film a 4/10 on the strength of the cinematography.  The story was a 1 or 2 at best and DiCaprio was not enough to elevate it to the level of mediocrity.  This is a film for die-hard Leo fans only.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

It starts off with Richard (Di Caprio) who's travelled to Thailand and whilst there he meets Daffy (Carlyle), who gives him a map to find The Beach. When he arrives to The beach having already shacked up with Etienne and Francoise, you begin to get the vibe and feel of how it is within their self-sufficient community on this tropical paradise.

I was staying in Ipanema Beach House (Rio de Janeiro) back in the summer of 2005 with many travellers and this movie brings back great memories of being there and meeting new people.

"Visually effective, but lacks narrative conflict and character structure. *1/2 out of ****.","THE BEACH / (2000) *1/2Rated R (for strong language, violence, sexuality, and drug use).According to many intelligent screenwriters, directors, and us critics, conflict is the basis of all drama. If there is no problem for the main character to solve or something for him or her to achieve, there is no purpose for the character's state of being. Without character we can have no story. Without story we can have no movie. The new sexy, glamorous novel adaptation from ""Trainspotting"" director Danny Boyle, runs into that rare, insidious flaw: other than some irrelevant singular character tensions, there isn't much conflict in its plot. The film primarily consists of a slew of related events placed side by side. Thus, many of the scenes do not propel the story forward. The conclusion doesn't even know where to commence because there is nothing to explicate.The filmmakers cast Leonardo DiCaprio as a young American traveler named Richard, who, as the movie opens, arrives in Thailand in quest for an adventure that can't be found in the common tourist locations. We don't know a whole lot about Richard except that he is a drifter named Richard. He rationalizes in the premise that nothing else matters, an extremely lazy method for the writers to escape character development. In reality, background information does indeed matter, and for us to care about him, we need to know more.Early in the movie, Richard meets an erotically appealing French woman, Francoise (Virginie Ledoyen), and her boyfriend, Etienne (Guillaume Canet). Soon afterwards, he stumbles upon a pot smoking, insane individual named Daffy. This strange person rambles about a paradise-like island that unseen by most people. Richard believes little this man states, but the next morning he discovers Daffy has killed himself and left him a map leading to this mysterious beach. He asks Francoise and Etienne to travel with him to the island . They accept his invitation.Robert Carlyle doesn't get to do much in this movie but contribute essential plot information required to move the story along. The narrative line uses his character, Daffy, later in the story when Richard slowly becomes disillusioned on the island. This theme of action is effective and developed with strong emotional depth.Once on the island, after discovering that a small potion is run by rigged drug farmers, Richard, Etienne and Francoise meet a secluded group of villagers who have permanently settled there, away from all the worlds' troubles. This picture perfect location is loosely led by a young woman named Sal (Tilda Swinton).The island's beach is truly paradise. The atmosphere is beautifully luxuriant. The filmmakers choose the perfect location for this movie, creating the right visual style. Also contributing to the successful island concepts: the characters develop the place with colorful, momentum building dialogue and pleasant oral description. Because of these measures the writers take with the importance of creating a paradise island, our imaginations are nurtured to believe both internally and visually that this place is almost a heaven.A conflict ""The Beach"" runs into is the attempt to fit too much material in one 119 minute movie. It tires to provide us with an illicit love story between the lustful Richard and the attractive Francoise. Thus Etienne provides us with some romantic competition. It also attempts providing us with a secret love affair between Richard and Sal, creating a villain, her boyfriend Bugs. We are also in an adventure film about the findings of drifters. The patrons also enters the mind of a young man whose mind becomes overtaken by his primal instincts. Also, the story about several young American travelers who behold a copy of a map to the island, threatening the native's existence. The plot with the foreign pot smugglers who murder people with assault rifles. We learn of the results of a shark attack and the pains the victims bring upon the group. The list goes on and on. If only the writers would have chosen a concrete subject and expanded on it rather than colliding a dozen different plots, we may have had a better movie.I really enjoyed the visual style in ""The Beach"" that is militant and creative. It uses neat camera angles and cinematography to its advantage. Leonardo DiCaprio contributes to film's mood. He performs with the necessary dramatic tensions that fulfil narrative requirements, although his obvious narration ends up explaining much of the story to us.Within the struggling situations  of ""The Beach"" lay some very deserving potential. If only the filmmakers would have used the God given gift of imagination, something this movie lacks. In a picture half as good as ""The Beach,"" the destructive flaw would be found within the film's conflict, not the lack of conflict being the destructive flaw.Brought to you by Twentieth Century Fox Productions.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good movie.  Hot chick.,I thought this was a pretty good movie.  The girl in it was very attractive and I was glad to see that they included a bit of nudity to please the audience.The movie was very visually pleasing.  I really got into it to the point where as I exited the theater I somehow expected to see sunny skies and palm trees surrounding me.  But of course all I saw was a late night's sky and 4 foot high snow banks.  This reality check was a real kick in the nuts.,9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Good movie, but Boyle's weakest.","The Beach is a good movie but it could have been better. The movie is in two parts, the first being about a quest for paradise and the second one being about the price of paradise. And while the first one is good, it is the second one which makes this movie worth seeing. It was made by the usual Danny Boyle-John Hodge team, but someone is missing: Ewan McGregor. McGregor would have been perfect as Richard, but instead, it is Leonardo DiCaprio who got the role. While DiCaprio is not a bad actor, he is not a good one either. He can't ruin a movie by himself, but he can't make it better. He is okay as Richard, and in the second half of the movie he is even good, but he still lacks charisma. And that lack of charisma is made even more evident in the scenes between him and Robert Carlyle, which gives an awesome performance in a small role. When both actors are on screen, DiCaprio disappears. Virginie Ledoyen was chosen because she is absolutely gorgeous, not because of her acting talent. Her performance as Françoise is barely okay. The rest of the cast is good. Tilda Swinton shows the obsession of her character very well. There is, as in any Boyle movie, an excellent soundtrack which includes such artists as Moby, Blur, The Chemical Brothers, UNKLE, Asian Dub Foundation, Underworld and New Order. Sadly, there is also a song by All Saints(another proof that this is Danny Boyle's most commercial movie yet). The photography is Oscar-worthy. As I said earlier, the second part of the movie is the best one. Also, the love story is not very well done and too predictable. But despite some flaws, this is still an interesting movie. I also believe it is better to have already seen Shallow Grave before seeing this one, as it tackles similar themes shown in a very different way. It is fun to see how Boyle includes them in is most commercial movie yet(and hopefully, ever).77%",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
