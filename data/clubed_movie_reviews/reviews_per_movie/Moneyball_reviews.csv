Much more than just a baseball film,"Despite being a non-sports fan, let alone a non-baseball fan, there are still a lot of great sports films out there...of which 'Moneyball' is an example of one.It is not going to be for all tastes. It is wordy with a lot of talk and not a whole lot of baseball, which may be a disappointment for fans, but to me that was not a bad thing at all. It saw a different side to the sport and how sports films are approached and portrayed, and it was done wonderfully, apart from a couple of scenes that were a touch too talky.'Moneyball' is a very well made film, not one of the most visually beautiful films of the year but still beautifully shot and the scenery is very handsome. Bennett Miller does a fine job directing, keeping the film engrossing and the drama alert and easy to follow. The music complements very nicely, never over-bearing or too low-key.Aaron Sorkin's script is smart and intelligent, filled with humour and heart, while the storytelling is well paced and enthralling, managing to make something exciting out of a potentially dry subject matter or a film that could have suffered from sluggish execution in lesser hands.Brad Pitt's lead performance is full of daring enthusiasm and he wins one over with his charisma. In contrast, Jonah Hill is superbly understated and Philip Seymour Hoffmann steals every scene he's in.Overall, a great film that is more than just a film about baseball. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
More than a game of numbers,"It has long been said that professional sports are more a game of politics than an actual game. Major League Baseball is not just a game of money, but in ""Moneyball"" it's a game of numbers versus a game of people. It's callousness at its highest when general managers trade away people as if they're objects with little regard for them or their family. Brad Pitt as Billy Beane, the GM of the Oakland As, seems to take that even further, treating people as if they are only numbers, and yet there was something refreshing and humanistic about the whole thing.It's 2001 and Oakland has just lost to the New York Yankees in the playoffs, not surprising, seeing as their payroll was 76 Million dollars less. The humour of ""Moneyball"" starts in the off-season when the team can't afford to keep their top players and Beane and his experienced scouts start tossing around some free agent ideas. One guy is no good because he frequents strip clubs too often, another guy is no good because his girlfriend is ugly, and on down the list they go. But then Beane meets Yale-educated, economics-, mathematics-, and computer-whiz, baseball fan, Peter Brand (Jonah Hill). He has no experience and he doesn't know these players. He doesn't know if they stand funny or if they swing ugly. He only knows their stats and their salary.A lot of people took offense to Beane's approach of degrading players down to the sum total of their on-base percentage and runs-in potential. But I liked it. Since the game of baseball isn't changing any time soon and players will always just be elements that can help win games and make more money, why not view them as numbers rather than as people with ugly girlfriends? Like Peter Brand, I like numbers.It's a movie about doing more with less, so I think we're just supposed to ignore the irony that they needed an excessively high budget to make it. In fact, it cost Sony Pictures more money to make this movie than it cost the Oakland A's to field their entire team for a season. Oh well, only one lesson for Hollywood at a time, and I still liked the movie.For a movie about people trying to change the game of baseball, it's only fitting that they are changing the sports genre. This isn't about the team and how many games they're going to win. As in all cases, they win some and they lose some. And we really only meet one player, the rest are just names thrown in the air. The movie is about Billy Beane, a real person, and a multi-dimensional character. At first he realizes that he is going to have to play the game with more than just money, and then after he makes it about numbers too, he finds a balanced statistical and personal concept.""Moneyball"" says that the game is about money, but the movie is about people. Writer Aaron Sorkin knows how to write people, and as evidenced by ""The Social Network"" (2010), he also knows how to turn computer-programming into riveting cinema. We find humour in the least-expected of places, we find heart in the least-expected of people, and 'Moneyball"" gives us a completely enjoyable movie that becomes so much more than numbers.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Worth admission even if you care squat about baseball,"Just caught this at the Toronto Film festival. It is undoubtedly one of the higher quality dramas in 2011. At its heart is a baseball-centric docu-drama, but even folks with zero baseball knowledge/interest can enjoy and be moved by this movie.Jonah Hill's performance in the film is phenomenal, and this may be the break that that young actor has been joshing for. His portrayal Peter Brand, a Yale Economics major and full time computer nerd is beyond believable, you practically swear that you know him personally a few days after the movie.The role of Billy Beane, played by Brad Pitt, is an incredibly demanding one. While there are tons of dialog, hack arguments, display of physical rage, etc; it is the silent story telling, emotional turmoil, change-of-heart reflections, pupils-triggered catharsis, and so on that are the toughest to convey and requires a well-seasoned character actor. This is easily Brad at his widest acting range - and you see all of it in a little over two hours.To be totally honest, I have not been tracking Philip Seymour Hoffman's acting career until this film. His portrayal of the ready-to-exit Oakland A's coach Art Howe, caught between ""the for-sure old money"" and the ""crazy senseless new reality"", convinced me that they couldn't have casted this part any better. Hoffman delivers on every single scene and you literally sweat his frustration along with him. This foil to Brad Pitt's character is actually effective enough to save several heavy- drama exchange where Brad's delivery falls slightly short of the mark.This is an ""onion"" movie, constructed purposely to be entertaining on many levels. It can be watched purely as an entertaining account of modern baseball history - how player statistics became one of the most important factors determining financial success in modern baseball.For more sentimental audience it tracks the journey of a man, forced to embrace change and disappointment as he fumble aimlessly through life etching out an unremarkable career first as a failing professional player, then small-time scout, and washed-out General Manager; only to finally wake up - and find himself becoming one of the greatest living innovator of the modern game.Finally, for the abstract-at-heart, and those who knows or cares little about the game of baseball (like yours truly), this is a tale of an industry under irreversible change; a documentary of the conflict between innovators who brave the slings-and-arrows to map out the new ways, and the old stalwarts who goes all out to protect their crumbling turf.At this historic moment in time, the message really hits a home-run! Other than baseball, we've recently witness similar changes and conflicts played out in public across the automobile, music distribution, movie distribution, book distribution, home computer, banking , and many other industries. Every unemployed in a vanishing industry can easily identify with the old Billy Beane, it is how Billy leverage his disappointment and experience, to turn his life around that we can all aspire to.A worthy note is the soundtrack for the movie, grass-root simple and heartfelt, it sent me looking for the album on itunes - only to realize that the movie has not been officially released yet.",,Anonymous,Biography
Pitt is at the top of his game,"I have another rare chance to catch a film more than a day before its national release. Usually when this happens there's a horde of folks queued up. When the doors to the theatre open, phones are sequestered, and a rush is put on to find prime seating. Those were movies starring a bunch of well less than household names. Surely a sneak to see a Brad Pitt movie would be even more chaotic. Unfortunately the waning popularity of America's pastime is as much of a deterrent as a movie star and free entertainment are agents of attraction.Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) is a former major leaguer turned general manager of the Oakland A's. After losing in the playoffs to the Yankees, the A's lose their stars to free agency. Billy is tasked with rebuilding despite a payroll that leaves the A's trailing the competition.While going through the usual motions, Billy happens by Pete Brand (Jonah Hill), an economist who may have found a way to scout baseball with the efficiency the A's need. The two delve in head first, and despite some tough outings they never back down.Pitt is at the top of his game. As an everyman—or at least one that isn't played up as wealthy, a man struggling to keep his job—frustration is clearly seen in Pitt's face. Pitt brings humanity to the ominous job of a general manager. Flashbacks of his stint in ""the show"" surmise his entire life, be it his divorce or relationship with his daughter Casey (Kerris Dorsey).Moneyball is not the action-packed sports outing one may be expecting. Director Bennett Miller spends very little time focusing on the game of baseball, or even the personalities of the players. Moneyball is a movie about management. Its deadpan, forthright approach is fresh compared to the typical underdog story filled with home runs and stolen bases. There's no electrifying music or thrilling speeches, but the excitement found in a phone call is realized as well as one could imagine. I don't think any actor other than Hill could pull of his slowly clinched fist.Like the good sports films, Moneyball shares a deeper meaning than simply winning. Immediately the value of loyalty comes to mind. The sports genre is changing, much like how the crew of this story changed talent scouting. Just last year a movie rose up about the struggle to manage a boxer, and now here's the struggle to manage a team.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Moneyball isn't focussed on just playing Baseball but instead the inner workings of building the greatest team.,"Hundreds of sports films, hundreds of them. Pretty sure Hollywood has tackled every type of sport, including Baseball several times over. Why should this one be any different? Well, this is the true story of the Oakland Athletics to which their General Manager at the time used a new technique of deciding a team: the Moneyball model. Using statistics and logic to pick the most effective players at the cheapest price, therefore building the ultimate economical team. Such a model could change the Baseball industry and negate years of traditional intuition. This is not so much about changing Baseball, but a personal journey for Billy Beane. He himself was chosen to play professionally, ditching his chances of further education. It didn't work out, and so he desired to change the system and defy the industry as a personal vendetta against them. Completely unconventional, having a computer system pick the most suitable players as opposed to listening to veterans who have something that algorithms do not: experience. Thoroughly enjoyed this film, and I can say I have no interest in Baseball (not particularly huge in the UK). A screenplay by Aaron Sorkin was destined to keep me captivated. Every script he writes is filled with sharp, concise dialogue that keeps you hooked on the characters. Brad Pitt looked effortlessly natural, owned every scene he was in. Jonah Hill...get ready guys...I actually liked. Finally!? A film I like him in. Cool, calm and calculated, was perfect at playing a graduate economist. Bennett Miller's direction was clean with a great mixture of old footage of Baseball games with the reconstructed acting. There's a scene towards the end where the result of a game relies on Chris Pratt hitting the ball. When he does...silence. I felt the tingles, was beautifully executed. Whilst the sport of Baseball does not interest me in the slightest, I loved the focus on the team building and thought it was brilliantly acted by everyone.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Sabermetrics in the Grand Ole Game,"Greetings again from the darkness. While reading ""Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game"" by Michael Lewis, I never once considered what it might look like as a movie. And I am the kind of guy who looks at a mailbox and wonders if a movie about a mailman might be interesting (Costner proved me wrong). If you are a baseball fan, you should see this movie. If you are not a baseball fan, the movie works very well as a metaphor for any business maverick who takes a risk and analyzes their company or industry from an entirely new perspective. The game of baseball was over a hundred years old when Oakland A's GM Billy Beane turned the institution on its ear.Mr. Lewis spent most of the 2002 season with the Oakland team and had full access to GM Billy Beane, Asst GM Paul DePodesta, and their process in putting together a team that would contend for the American League title ... all under the severe handicap of ridiculous salary constraints placed by team owners.In this movie, Brad Pitt is spot on as Billy Beane - the cocky, tobacco spitting former jock trying desperately to put his stamp on the institution of baseball. Due to some lawsuit of which I know nothing, the DePodesta role is renamed Peter Brand and is played by Jonah Hill, who looks absolutely nothing like Mr. DePodesta (who played baseball at Harvard). Despite this, Mr. Hill does an terrific job of becoming the statistical whiz who can analyze data and place value on players ... a skill he is obsessed with even 10 years later.Watching Beane trying to communicate the point of change to the old school scouts is simply priceless and painful. Years of scouting based on body type and girlfriend ranking is replaced by statistical data spit out by Brand's computer. The real fun comes when the team's field Manager, Art Howe (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), flashes his bah-humbug attitude, bucks Beane's system and continues coaching old school ... from the gut. It's not until Beane takes away all other options that Howe is forced to follow the new plan.Baseball fans know that Bill James is the godfather of sabermetrics in baseball. For years his formulas and calculations were ignored by owners, managers and scouts. Thanks to the A's success, ALL teams now utilize some form of sabermetrics combined with old fashioned scouting. Every measurable event in a game is tracked and results are analyzed. Many fans say it has sucked the joy out of the game. Others say it has provided opportunities for players previously ignored. I prefer to look at it as the same in any industry ... everyone looks for a competitive advantage. Never ignore a tool or approach that can make your company more profitable or your team more competitive.Being a long time Texas Ranger fan, I must mention some of the ties to this story. The Rangers current manager, Ron Washington (portrayed by Brent Jennings), was an infield coach on those Oakland A's and gets a few scenes. Grady Fuson was the Head Scout for the A's and later came to the Rangers as co-GM or Asst GM (depending who you ask) but had a very limited stay. Mike Venafro was a relief pitcher for the A's who gets traded in 2002 so they can pick up a more valued reliever to take his spot. It should also be noted that current Rangers GM Jon Daniels and his talented staff have a place for sabermetrics and their formula has worked.The director of the movie is Bennett Miller, who was responsible for the excellent ""Capote"", which also starred Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Bennett's DP here is Wally Pfister, who works frequently with the great Christopher Nolan. Pfister's camera work here is superb. The amazing writing team of Steve Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin provide a script with sharp dialogue and just enough baseball lingo so that everyone can follow. Supporting actors include Chris Pratt (Parks & Recreation) as Scott Hatteberg, poster child for sabermetrics, Robin Wright as Beane's ex-wife, and fantastic writer/director Spike Jonze as Wright's zenned-out new husband and the polar opposite of Beane.I need to make a point about the performance of Jonah Hill. His movies ""Superbad"" and ""Get Him to the Greek"" are not my type of movies so I was never a big fan. That changed when I saw ""Cyrus"" last year. During the Q&A after this screening, Mr. Hill pointed out that ""Cyrus"" was the bridge that allowed him to be cast in this movie ... his bridge to drama. He went on to state that his acting heroes are Dustin Hoffman and Bill Murray because they have had successful careers in both comedy and drama. I can honestly say that it is easy to see Jonah Hill having a Bill Murray type career, especially since he has now lost so much weight - a significant weight loss after the filming of Moneyball. He is no longer the funny fat guy. He is a talented actor.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A high quality crowd pleaser,"America's pastime has returned to the big screen and it is more witty and elegant than ever. Moneyball is the inspiring story of the Oakland A's, a team that was all but bankrupt but managed to beat the odds through intelligence and perseverance. Brad Pitt plays Billy Beane, the team's general manager who has run out of ideas on how to make his strapped for cash team successful. This is until he meets Pete Brand, played by Jonah Hill, an economic major from Yale. Brand devises a formula that analyzes players in a way nobody else does, thus revealing statistics about players that no one else can see. Beane and Brand use this formula to build up their unlikely roster of misfits. The themes of this film run deep through our aspiring minds. It's a film about beating the odds, going against the current, and standing up for what you believe is right. It is a moving and inspiring film that really only uses baseball as a backdrop for its deeper and more universal themes. It's a moving film and you don't have to be a baseball fan to love it.The strongest element of Moneyball is easily Aaron Sorkin and Steve Zaillian's incredibly sharp script. Moneyball brings up fond memories of 2010's The Social Network in which Sorkin pulled out all the stops in his intellectual screen writing ability. The dialogue in Moneyball moves at the same pace as any Sorkin or Zaillian script does. It has a driving cadence to it that keeps a film entirely dominated by dialogue very exciting and entertaining. Their script is lively, energetic, and diverse. Moneyball has intensely emotional scenes that compel and inspire, but then it has its lighthearted and much funnier moments that have the exact same affect. There's a lot to be said for any film that has the capability to make its audience laugh and cry in the same two hour span. Moneyball is a film like that and it all begins at Sorkin's fantastic script.However, it is helped by the film's superb cast. Brad Pitt leads the film perfectly, creating a very interesting protagonist and driving the film in a way few leads can. He attacks his role as Billy Beane with the utmost care, respect, and sincerity. Despite all of Pitt's good looks and always recognizable celebrity face, you will have a hard time remembering that Pitt is the one acting, not Billy Beane. But, as always, where would such a strong lead be without his supporting cast? Moneyball has that supporting cast, and it finds its immeasurable talent in the most unlikely of places. I'm talking, of course, about Jonah Hill. Hill has built his career on being a comedy caricature with over the top flicks such as Superbad and Get Him to the Greek. But all that changes when Hill takes on the role of Pete Brand. His performance is stellar. He proves himself to be a true up and comer who won't find himself restricted within the confines of teen comedy.Overall, Moneyball is your typical crowd pleaser, but it is incredibly high quality. It is so well directed, so superbly acted, and Sorkin and Zaillian's script is practically flawless. Personally this isn't the film I will go crazy about. Rather, it is a film that I will enjoy so sincerely and with all my heart. I really did love this film and my respect for it is eternal. It may be typical and straightforward in its overall themes, but the quality of the film outshines this. Moneyball is just an excellent film.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"""How Can You Not Be Romantic About Baseball?"" 💯","Moneyball ""changed the game forever"" (the baseball-movie game). No other baseball film (nor any other sports film) has achieved this level of intimate connection to the front office of a professional sports franchise (and made it this interesting and engaging), nor achieved this level of combined excellence in cinematography, editing, and story-telling.Moneyball avoids resorting to melodramatic baseball movie cliches - the truth is often more interesting than fiction, and this is truly a fascinating tale based on real events.Steven Zaillian, Aaron Sorkin, and Stan Chervin share screenwriting credit, and the screenplay deserved its awards and nominations.Director Bennett Miller did a fabulous job in pulling this winning team together, and the entire cast and crew knocked it out of the proverbial park.This is one of Brad Pitt's best film performances, and Jonah Hill and Philip Seymour Hoffman were both on their A-Game. The entire supporting cast was spot-on individually and as an ensemble.There is simply no weak link in production, and after seeing this film a half dozen times, it earns an 'instant_palmer' 10 - a rating I don't give out capriciously on IMDb.Moneyball sets a high bar for baseball movies and there is no other film like it.My choice as best sports movie of all time; on my Top-100 Greatest Films list, and; moving up the rankings every year. 👍👍",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not a fan of baseball or statistics but I liked this a lot,"Well colour me surprised, I went into this expecting to be bored silly despite Brad Pitt and the Oscar nominations. I'm just not much of a baseball movie fan though so I figured I'd give it half an hour (because it was on TV) and bail. But somehow this held my interest despite the fact that (yes) its about baseball, odds/statistics and v-e-r-y slow moving.I can't even explain why I liked this? Well the amazing performances helped. Led by Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill as Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane who turns baseball on its ear when he reinvents the Oakland A's, by employing unorthodox scouting methods and statistical data to place a different sort of value on the players he picks for the team.This did make me realize just how disposable the players are. Brutal. Oh, and apparently it's is based on a book, undoubtedly a very dry, heavy on statistics and number crunching, audience specific book. Kill me now! 09.13",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Baseball By The Numbers,"My first comment would be to warn people who aren't big baseball fans that this is a baseball movie. In fact, it's not even so much about baseball - it's about the behind the scenes machinations involved in building a baseball team. There's very little onfield action depicted, so unless the idea of watching the management team rather than the players really turns your crank, this likely won't be for you. Personally, I'm not a huge baseball fan. I follow the game, I know the teams and the big name players, but I'm not a fanatic. So I approach this movie from that perspective.In 2001, the Oakland A's went 102-60, but then lost in the playoffs. They then had several of their best players leave after the season, because they didn't have enough money to pay them, and General Manager Billy Beane (played by Brad Pitt) was forced to try to keep the team competitive on what would be generously described as a shoestring budget. Without the money to pay for the best players, Beane recruits a young executive from the Cleveland Indians named Peter Brand (played by Jonah Hill) and together they try to craft a winning team strictly by the numbers - using in depth statistical analysis to determine not so much the biggest names but the best fits for their particular team, and we watch as the 2002 season unfolds.There are things about this movie that I liked. Brad Pitt for one. I thought his performance as Beane was very good and very believable. What I also found believable was the tension that rose between Beane and the team's scouts as well as manager Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman) - all of whom were ""old school"" baseball people who didn't understand what Beane and Brand were trying to do and weren't especially co-operative. The behind the scenes look was as interesting as it could be, I suppose - especially the glimpse at how players are rated and evaluated and treated.But I have to admit that this movie still didn't really appeal to me. First, I'm not a baseball fanatic, and in my opinion this is a niche movie for a niche audience. I appreciated that Beane kept the team winning, but to be honest they didn't actually win anything of importance (and still haven't.) Yes, the team pulled off an amazing 20- game winning streak in 2002, but they lost in the playoffs and as Beane himself said, nothing matters if you don't win the last game of the season. That's true. I'm enough of a baseball fan that I'm sure I noticed in the summer of 2002 that the A's were on a massive, mega- winning streak, but I don't actually remember it 10 years later. I guess in the end that's what really makes me scratch my head over this movie. It's just not especially important. As much as this was supposed to be a new way of building a team - frankly, it doesn't work. With no salary cap, baseball is about money. Yes, the movie suggests that the Boston Red Sox used the system Beane and the A's developed, but it leaves out an important point - the Red Sox used the system - AND MONEY! The title is accurate. Baseball is about money. The American League especially is divided into 3 groups - the Yankees and the Red Sox (one or both of whom will be in the playoffs because they have a lot of money and can buy the best players); their division rivals the Rays, Blue Jays and Orioles, who (aside from a massive upset periodically) can't compete with them over a full 162 game season and who start every season knowing that they're going to end up on the outside looking in; and everybody else, who compete to be the best of the rest and hope to be able to beat the Yankees or Red Sox in a 3 of 5 or 4 of 7 series.This isn't a bad movie, but I for one thought it was massively over- rated. It's neither overly interesting nor overly important, and why anyone would have thought of it as a nominee for Best Picture I have no idea. (5/10)",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Intriguing, investing, with a great screenplay and a fantastic performance at its core","Sports films... Not a huge fan of them, and don't see them much because of the predictability of them. However, one cannot deny the impact that some have, like for example in recent years The Fighter and Aronofsky's The Wrestler. Moneyball can now join them and is among the best films of the year.The film is always intriguing, and Aaron Sorkin (whose screenplay for The Social Network was last year's best) is to be congratulated for this. It's his wonderful script that gives the film the energy. What also helps is the lack of predictability. Sure, one can't seem to hope for an 'experimental' sports film, since this is based on a true story. However, Sorkin, as well as the director, always keeps things refreshing and interesting without becoming repetitive and stale. The dialogue is brilliant of course, and the lack of 'field' action makes it even more involving so when the important ball scene comes along it makes an impact. The other big driving factor is Brad Pitt, who has had an incredible year. His performance in The Tree of Life is already among his finest work, and now this joins it as well. He portrays all of the character traits with such versatility and charisma. A great and satisfying protagonist.Overall, I was incredibly pleased with this. It is to this day the best adapted screenplay of the year, and not surprisingly Pitt is my win in both categories for both of his films.",,Anonymous,Biography

Who thought Baseball and Economics would make an interesting movie?,"¨There are rich teams and there are poor teams, then there's fifty-feet of crap, and then there's us. ¨ Moneyball was among the best films I've seen this year. It really caught me by surprise since I'm not a big baseball fan and wasn't expecting much considering the subject matter. Baseball and economics seemed like a bad combination for me, but since Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman were all starring in this film I had to see it. It's impossible not to fall in love with the Billy Beane character and the relationship he had with his young assistant Peter Brand. They are really the center of this movie so if you're doubting wither or not you should see this worrying about the subject matter all I can say is go see it anyways because it is much more than simply another baseball movie. There are some very strong and emotional scenes where I couldn't help but get goose bumps over a team and a sport I really didn't care for. That is how good this film is. Moneyball is directed by Bennett Miller, who also directed Capote in which Seymour Hoffman won an Oscar for his lead performance as Truman Capote. Miller has proved he can make some great films. The movie was adapted from the book written by Michael Lewis (Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game) which focuses on the true story of the Oakland A's General Manager, Billy Beane, who managed to put together the 2002 team on a very low budget by using computer-generated analysis to draft his players based on a formula which was perfected by his young assistant. This would change the game forever. Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin (The Social Network and Charlie Wilson's War) did a great job at adapting the screenplay for the big screen.The movie begins with real footage from the last 2001 divisional series game between the Yankees and the A's. The A's were winning the series two games to nothing, but the Yankees came back to win the final three games and leave the A's out of the Championship Divisional game for a second year in a row. The bad news for General Manager, Billy Beane (Brad Pitt), is that he's going to lose his three star players for the next season. The A's don't have the kind of budget that other rich teams like the Red Sox or the Yankees have. It's just impossible to compete against those teams, so it's time to think outside the box. Billy meets with his talent scouts to see how they can replace these key players without any money, but finds no solution. He decides to hire a young Yale Economic graduate who was working as an adviser for the Cleveland Indians. His name is Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) and he uses statistical data to analyze each player and decide which one has a better value based on their batting average and price. Beane and Brand go against all odds and decide to build their team entirely on these computer statistics. The scouts are outraged by the decision, but Beane believes this is the only way he can compete with the big budget teams. Beane also has some arguments with manager Art Howe (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) over whom he should start, but the main focus of the film relies on the relationship between Beane and Brand. There are also a few scenes dealing with Beane and his relationship with his young daughter Casey (Kerris Dorsey) who lives with her mom Sharon (Robin Wright) in California as well.Moneyball works as both a sports film and a biographical movie, but it is really much more than that. It works thanks to a very strong performance from both Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill who shine in every scene they are together in. Since Beane doesn't like to watch the games for fear of jinxing the team we don't really get to see a lot of baseball. There are several conversations revolving around baseball, but it really isn't that central to the film. The true heart of the film is Beane who we all want to see succeed and silence the critics. We want his system to work because he is such a charismatic character and he believes in what he is doing. The scene where the streak begins is very inspiring and one of the best moments in sports film in my opinion. I really got a lot of goose bumps during that twentieth game winning streak. I also enjoyed the side story revolving around Billy and his daughter Casey. Kerris Dorsey has little screen time, but she is great opposite Brad Pitt. As for Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Robin Wright they really don't have much to work with and don't bring anything to the story really. It's a shame because Hoffman is a great actor and he could've had a better role in this film. In my opinion the ending is perfect as well and the soundtrack was also great. Moneyball was one of the most emotional experiences I've had with a movie all year and I really recommend this inspiring film.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Like a satisfying double-header,"Clocking in at 2 hours, 13 minutes, ""Moneyball"" requires a commitment. Beyond time, an interest - or at least a lack of aversion - to mathematical concepts and, obviously, baseball also will aid in the enjoyment of this biopic. While athletic Brad Pitt does a reasonable impression of athletic former ballplayer Billy Beane, the true star is author Michael Lewis. Lewis is contemporary literature's foremost writer on men, money and the risks the one takes with the other. His ability to illuminate the arcane economic theories the character of Peter Brand (the Oscar-nominated Jonah Hill) brings to bear on baseball player selection gives the book and the movie real heft. Hill likely does not deserve the Oscar nod for player a fairly uni-dimensional statistician who is not taxed to demonstrate any real emotion (unless awkward is an emotion). At least the wildly miscast Philip Seymour Hoffman didn't get one for the cerebral actor's misguided attempt at portraying put-upon Oakland A's manager Art Howe. Beyond these three men the other characters are largely forgettable former (mostly) baseball players. In short, if you like baseball or numbers the film is a must-see but otherwise you'll find it overlong and lacking true dramatic engagement.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Art vs science,"As an Australian, the thought of seeing a movie like this a few years ago would have been inconceivable...watching a movie about baseball would be on my ""things not to do"" list...but watching a movie about statistics and baseball? Even more inconceivable! What changed? In the wake of Sri Lanka beating Australia (I think) in the one day cricket World Cup final many years ago (a form of the game that cricket 'purists' would no doubt deride as 'baseball' and not the 'real form' of the game...heaven knows what they now make of of the Twenty20 form of the game!), I did happen upon an article which argued that Sri Lanka had revolutionised this shortened form of the game with their batting tactics. That story intrigued me...I doubt if Sri Lanka's batting strategy was created from statistics or maths, but it was persuasively argued in the article that it had mathematical or statistical logic to it (no doubt with a big helping of common sense too).Furthermore, I had dabbled with free, customisable N.B.A. fantasy basketball leagues, where I had created two leagues with opposing philosophies...in one league, unsporting conduct was astronomically punished, whilst in the other league it was nicely rewarded. This created drafting conundrums...someone like Kobe Bryant could be a star in the fair play league...but would be a star in the foul play league. He was definitely a gamble in the fair play league though...in one year he could crush the coach's hopes, and in another year he would be a surprising star. I did get the distinct impression that coaches' who did well did so with the help of spreadsheets...to crunch the statistics...which is what this movie is all about. Before I start the review proper, I'll just mention that I may have been roped into joining someone's fantasy baseball league as a quid pro quo for them joining my league...just found the whole language of baseball gobbledygook...and never really hung around that sport for long. It's a good thing that this movie was not geared to those fans who love the gobbledygook (be it something called ERAs or whatever it's called).Based on a true story, this movie outlines the revolutionary approach to selecting a baseball team for the major league in the wake of having your star players bought for large sums of money by cashed up teams. That's a major theme of the movie...the underdog against an unfair system. The approach taken contrasts that taken in Australia for the game of Australian rules football (AFL), where a form of 'socialism' was instituted over a decade ago, I think, with 'equalised' drafting, priority picks and salary caps. This 'socialism' has seen a diversity of teams win the sport's major trophy. Perhaps the main character in this movie, Billy Beane, might have been content with such a system.Brad Pitt plays Billy Beane, and it is striking how much Brad seems to be growing into Robert Redford's face as he ages. Billy is the general manager of an underfunded (by cashed up teams' standards) baseball team, the Oakland Athletics. As in many sports where distorted markets rule (e.g. European soccer, where American multi-billionaires borrow huge sums of money and buy famous teams and load them up with debt...which is fine...until the bubble burst and the teams might face bankruptcy...or, where Russian oil billionaires buy teams and eat into their own cash reserves, paying insane salaries for stars. In both cases, there really is no business model, apart from paying crazy money which you either do or do not have for purpose of winning trophies), Oakland has developed some players into stars...only to see them picked off by cashed up teams.Pitt plays Beane in the charismatic/brash way that Orson Welles played the youthful and exuberant 'Citizen' Kane, and he does a nice line in sizing people up and yet biting his tongue or taking sly amusement from their ways. This is interesting due to the history of Beane...he was seen as a potential star of the game and he does carry around some of that baggage with him at times. His experience illustrates the art vs science approach to baseball...he was drafted due to the former and he has to butt heads with his recruitment department in his new role as the team's general manager in order to bring a more scientific approach to recruiting.Peter Brand plays Jonah Hill, a smart draft by Beane, who recognises in this geek a man capable of revolutionising the thinking of his recruitment department. Peter/Jonah is the most unathletic man you could imagine...short of someone who would require a crane to take them out of their bedroom by a hole in the roof in order to be taken to a hospital. He's like me playing fantasy N.B.A...or that man in the Matrix who sees everything in terms of binary digits...even that beautiful woman in a red dress.For people who enjoy watching the game of baseball on the big screen, the last half hour has some nice moments for them. What makes this film more interesting for a general audience though is the intriguing insight into the backroom discussions of an elite sporting team. How players are valued and reasons why they may not be valued more highly are discussed.In some ways this story is like those horse racing stories where someone buys a horse for under a $1,000 which was destined for the knacker's yard, but it goes on to win a fortune. You do get the equivalent of horses bound for the knacker's yard in this movie, as far as the baseball players who are recruited by Beane.There was a scene I liked in this movie, where reporters discussed who was responsible for the team's turnaround...it was all attributed to the coach...which was in contrast to the tale that the movie tells.A well told story which did make me laugh on occasion.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A really interesting story with a fairly good movie,"The story behind the movie is really interesting. As with any movie ""based on"" real events, there is some fudging of the details for cinematic effect, but the main plot gets it pretty accurate. Everyone in the movie plays there part well, including the kind of invented character for Jonah Hill. The movie is a little long and kind of slow though, without much of the usual cheering drama involved in a sports movie. I would only recommend it for people who are already into sports, especially baseball, or are intrigued by the story before the movie starts.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Moneyball's appeal to a mass market audience trades depth and meaning for a feel good underdog story,"Baseball is the sport to follow if you love numbers. Almost every aspect of the game can be and is quantified by a percentage which both ball clubs and fans use to rank players. The science of ranking players using particular categories, specifically on base percentage, is the foundation for an analysis program known as sabermetrics. Moneyball never uses this term, but that is what they are talking about.Moneyball tells the story of the Oakland Athletics' 2002 season. At the end of 2001, the A's lost the divisional playoff series to the Yankees and then their three superstars left for free agency. Compared to the Yankees and the vast majority of the rest of Major League Baseball teams, the Oakland A's were poor. They could not compete with the other clubs to put well known impact players on their roster. General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) pleaded with his scouts to come up with a new way to identify players instead of the usual way it had been done for the past hundred years or so, mostly gut instinct and the usual power numbers.While in Cleveland on a bartering trip to replace the holes in his lineup, Billy meets Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), a low level player analyst, who has some unconventional ideas about what it really takes to win games. To win games, you have to produce runs. To produce runs, you have to get on base, be it with hits or walks. Scouts and baseball crowds prefer hits since they are far more sexy than walks; however, they are one in the same to Peter Brand and Billy Beane quickly becomes an acolyte to this new way of thinking. Shifting focus to the most undervalued players in baseball, Oakland starts signing guys who are considered too old, sub-par fielders, and unimpressive at the plate. Not only does the scouting staff start to revolt, but the coach, Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman) looks at Billy and his methods like they are from Mars.Sabermetrics was not new in 2002, but no ball club ever put a team together using mostly stats before. Everybody expected them to lose, be at the cellar of their division, and for Billy to be fired at the end of the season. However, the 2002 season went in a different direction and produced some profound ripple effects throughout the rest of the league and how teams valued players afterwards. Moneyball is definitely a film for baseball fans and stat geeks. However, if you are not into baseball, you most likely will not enjoy Moneyball very much. There is limited on field action and a lot of detailed conversations about baseball methods with its corresponding jargon.Moneyball is based on a 2004 book and is advertised as the true story of what happened in that 2002 season; however, there are a lot of dramatizations and changes. First of all, there is no Peter Brand in real life. In fact, Billy's Assistant General Manager joined the team in 1999 and was named Paul DePodesta. Mr. DePodesta did not like how they wrote his character in the script and asked that his name be changed. He argues that he was not only focused on statistics to shape the team.I desperately wanted Moneyball to be an amazing film. I love baseball and I really enjoy reading and talking about baseball stats. Unfortunately, Moneyball is not a great movie, it is just OK. It lacks a certain weight and depth. Early scenes between Pitt and Hill could have been much deeper concerning their ideas to change the way the game is played, but they are light and choppy. Peter Brand never really gets a long monologue to explain just how his ideas could create a winning team from start to finish. Furthermore, the character of Coach Howe is ridiculous. Philip Seymour Hoffman spends his very limited screen time hurling out one word guttural answers and just looks ill. I know he was meant to disagree with the way the team was headed, but why make him look deathly pale and on the verge of a nervous breakdown?See Moneyball if you are a baseball fan; you will enjoy the behind the scenes look at the scouting meetings and the shenanigans which go on at the trade deadline. However, be prepared for a light fiction film which can stray pretty far from what really happened that year.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Unlikeable people plus little baseball make this a bore,"I watched this on TV finally in November 2013. I am puzzled why anyone thinks highly of this dull film with no likable characters. The film shows how the Oakland Athletics ) won a division title in 2002, despite losing three star players after 2001. It focuses almost solely on general manager Billy Beane, (Brad Pitt) and his new assistant, a fictional character named Peter Brand (played by Jonah Hill). It is presented that Peter's chief contribution is letting Beane know that on-base average is the best way to judge the value of players.One night the club is going for the American League record of 20 straight wins, Beane is out driving to Visalia to see their minor league club. I guess we aren't supposed to know it is a 4-hour drive, because the A's are playing a night game when Billy decides to turn back to see the A's game instead. I should imagine it unlikely the Visalia club to have a game scheduled for midnight, so why was he driving there at that time of night to see the minor leaguers?My chief criticism of the film is they make Beane out to be rather hostile, almost rude, to virtually everyone around him. I hope the real Billy Beane doesn't behave like the movie Beane. There is one scene of Beane and his ex-wife and her new husband. For no apparent reason, Beane treats the new husband rather shabbily. I wonder why they included this scene since there was no follow-up to it, no other scene dealing with any aspect of his broken marriage. Nor was there any hint that in real life, Beane had a new wife himself. They throw in 2 or 3 scenes of him being nice to his teenage daughter. Since the film was almost totally about his work life, they would have been wise to leave out the small bits with the daughter altogether.Just like Billy and Peter, none of the players have any character development. Unlike the stars, the players are quite minor characters.As a baseball fan, I thought it laughable that Billy flies from California to Cleveland just to talk to the Cleveland GM about making a trade for a little-used relief pitcher. That was to set up Beane noticing Peter, leading to him being hired by Beane.Another laugh came when the two were together in Beane's office and Peter tells Beane that the left-handed reliever he wants to get from Cleveland, could only be wanted by 1 other club—San Francisco. Beane immediately phones the Giants and engineers a quick trade to get them another lefty reliever, so Cleveland will have to trade the guy to Billy. I dare say that a good left-handed reliever would in any season be desired by more than one or two clubs.The film tries so hard to make it seem like this new strategy of Beane's—look for high on-base average players, disdain bunting and stealing—he tells them at one point that they should never bunt, leads to Oakland winning the division in 2002. Facts are they bunted for sacrifices 25 times in 2001, 20 times in 2002. The did cut down their stolen bases from 68 to 46, but considering the center fielder they lost, Johnny Damon had stolen 27 himself in 2001, and he was replaced someone who stole only 4, the lower stolen base figure must surely be attributed to that more than anything to do with strategy. It was interesting to hear Peter telling Billy early on that he didn't want Johnny Damon, that it was good for Oakland he was gone. Many people in the game consider Damon's play huge in helping the Red Sox win the World Series two years later, and later helping the Yankees to their only post-2000 World Series title to date. The A's have one post-season series win since 1993, and haven't won 100+ in any season since 2002.I know the A's really relied on more than OBA, but that one stat cited in the film as being key makes it worth noting that the club On-Base Average in 2001 was .345, and in 2002 it dropped to .339. Their runs scored dropped from 884 to 800. I found it troubling that the real hitting stars of the A's, Miguel Tejada and Eric Chavez, each of whom drove in over 100 runs are not featured at all.More significantly, the key role of the pitching staff was totally ignored. The only scene featuring a pitcher, was Chad Bradford, who like a grateful kid approached Beane at the start of the 2002 season and thanked him for being the first one to give him a chance. This was rather weird in two ways. First, Bradford not only had pitched in 44 games over three seasons with the White Sox, but had worked 35 games in 2001 for Oakland. It's true he worked more in 2002, but he hardly would have known about getting a bigger chance before the season started. The other thing that was weird was the way Beane reacted. He couldn't wait to walk on past Bradford, almost like the ""Go away boy, you bother me,"" notion of W.C. Fields.Even though I knew the A's haven't reached a World Series since 1990, how they've stayed competitive, which they indeed have, seemed like a good idea for a movie. But Beane seemed like such a jerk who doesn't know how to talk to people nicely. Peter had almost no character other than a guy who quickly comes up with numbers. And no other person's character was explored in any way. So we got not character development AND almost no baseball action other than what took the place of the old newspaper headlines in movies from decades ago. All we're left with is some people talking about the fortunes of a baseball team during one season, plus a few random highlights.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Possibly the best baseball movie I have I ever seen.,"In a league where the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox regularly field teams with $100 million-plus payrolls, how do you field a competitive team with a payroll that is a mere fraction of that, at $37 million? This question could have been the basis for a dry documentary, only appealing to a legion of die hard statistical analysis baseball geeks, but instead, it forms the basis of a film that shows a great deal of heart and spirit which moves it into a statement I never thought I would be making, but here goes: Moneyball is possibly the best baseball movie I have I ever seen.Granted, I've never seen Bull Durham or Major League, but even with that deficiency in my sports film-viewing I can say with some confidence that this is at least as good or better than Field of Dreams and at least as good or better than The Bad News Bears.The answer to the conundrum of fielding a competitive team with a limited budget is in fact the one sought by Billy Beane, the general manager of the Oakland Athletics. In 2001, after sending a team to the divisional playoffs only to lose in a heartbreaking game 5 to the big market big money New York Yankees (who went on to lose the World Series to Arizona), he was losing three of his star players and he simply could not afford to replace them. He hit the realization that in order to compete, he had to re-think the way that baseball business is done. No longer could he think in terms of buying his way into the playoffs (as the Yankees seem to do every year), but instead he would devise a system that would revolutionize the way that baseball is playedor at least they way a team is constructed. To this end, he constructed an unorthodox and unconventional system which at the time was completely unheard-of. Suddenly, players were valued not for home runs or batting average, but for walks and runs scored. Under this system, 3 players making 250,000 each were worth the same as one player making 7 million. And in doing so, Beane managed to field a winning team who set an American League record for consecutive wins. Critics may point out that as yet, under this system, the A's still haven't won a championship. But they were always competitive, which is more than we can say for the majority of the teams in the league who also are not winning championships and are in fact spending a lot more money.These ideas have been around for about ten years now and are now pretty much commonplace in baseball, but at the time Beane was ridiculed for trying them. The writing is excellent (Aaron Sorkin has a screenplay credit) and draws you in even without a lot of ""action."" We know that Oakland will not win that final game of the series, we know that Beane will continue to strive for that elusive championship, but we still have a lot to root for and cheer for. Even my personal feelings about my own team (sigh--long-suffering Orioles fan) did not in anyway prevent me from cheering the A's improbable drive toward history. The relationship between Beane and his daughter is a nice, and helps to drive in the fact that to some, baseball is more than a game. You might even argue that this film is not so much about baseball but about the effect our choices have on our lives and the lives around us--the supposed threat that unconventional thinking presents to the status quo.Ultimately this film is the Bad News Bears of the new millennium--a ragtag group of veterans and rookies and cast-offs come together under the visionary leadership of a general manager who dared to think outside the box. It is possible that if you have absolutely no interest in baseball, you would still like this movie for its message about resisting the urge to do what is safe and easy in favor of what is odd and maybe even crazy...and works.",,Anonymous,Biography

A great translation of a beautifully written Michael Lewis story,"Moneyball's greatest aspects: an adapted screenplay written by Aaron Sorkin, based off of a Michael Lewis book.The film is incredibly well written, with each scene reliving the story of general manager Billy Beane (played by Brad Pitt) struggling to rebuild an unfortunate, low budget Oakland baseball team. The screenplay allows for excitement and attentiveness, somehow changing a slow moving sport into an enjoyable, dramatic motion picture.The attention to detail throughout the film, like the fit of the baseball pants and the design of the locker room, truly shows the hard work and effort put in by the production crew. Despite the simplicity of baseball uniforms relative to usual film attire, the costume design for Moneyball is still impressive. The well designed set for the baseball team's locker room and offices allows for long shots through hallways that show characters' moods and general ambiance.Additionally, the film crew did a fantastic job of understanding and breaking down the data-oriented system that is used in baseball today to rate players. Director Bennett Miller successfully delivers comprehensive scenes to teach the audience about this complicated concept, all the while incorporating drama and baseball action into the film.Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill are both fantastic in Moneyball. Both of them grow into their characters extremely well, and the film successfully manages to get the audience to become attached to them. Brad Pitt wonderfully depicts inner frustration and pain on the screen, all the while smiling externally to his character's coworkers and family. His performance is further enhanced by the personalities of his supporting cast, specifically Jonah Hill and Philip Seymour Hoffman.Director of Photography Wally Pfister has a great sense for a scene's look and feel, and he proves that to us throughout the film. For a baseball movie, Pfister shoots scenes with aspects of ingenuity and reality, sometimes shooting scenes the way a person would view a baseball game through their TV. His use of both natural light and artificial light is nicely done — specifically, Pfister's shots tend to have certain lights turned off, whether in a room or in a stadium, to project a dramatic feel onto the scene.Additionally, the editing was superb. By going back and forth between the 2001/2002 baseball video montages with the film footage, the film is able to tie together 2001/2002's exciting commentary with slow motion pitches and swings.Ultimately, Moneyball is able to successfully fulfill and translate the beautifully written story told by Michael Lewis.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

The torch has been passed.,"Moneyball is a fine, diverting picture dealing with Oakland Athletic's GM Billy Beane. The film documents his successful attempt in 2002 to build a competitive baseball team with low-rent players. The film is a baseball fan's dream, and full of interesting characters and good writing. The main thing I noticed above everything else, however, is that the torch has officially been passed in American cinema. For years it was Robert Redford as the eternally handsome American leading man who got all the great parts, despite his often limited acting range. Now that Redford is too old for that distinction, Pitt has finally reached the point is his career where he can take the torch and run with it.Perhaps on the set of Spy Game they even agreed on this transition. ""Brad,"" Robert may have said to him one morning outside their luxury trailers, ""one of these days it will be all you. I can't fool them forever. Just smile at the camera, let them give you enough back-light, find a cause or two, and you will be immortal."" ""Cool. That's heavy,"" Pitt would have replied. ""But do I have to have a cause? Can't I just hold a film festival in the mountains like you do each winter?"" ""No,"" Redford would have replied, sternly. ""Sundance will always be my gig. Maybe you can just find an attractive, yet creepy woman and help her adopt a bunch of racially diverse kids. That can be your cause."" ""Okay. Cool,"" Pitt replied. You get the picture. Anyway, Brad Pitt is now officially THAT GUY. He's the handsome leading man who can't really act, but doesn't necessarily need to. Clark Gable might have preceded Redford.But as far as Moneyball goes, its good enough, but not great. I loved the cost cutting measures the Athletics use to fit within their meager budget. Having players actually pay for soda in their own locker room. Signing fossils like Dave Justice and having to put him out on banners since there are no real stars on the team. It also gives the players some nice human touches. Think of a journeyman like Scott Hatteburg. What do these guys do for money once all MLB teams are convinced you have nothing left to give the sport? They still have families to feed, but all of a sudden no means to do so. The film suffers from too many maudlin scenes of Pitt moping around or driving around depressed. The film needed to be more upbeat. Too much time spent on Pitt's family, too. But did you notice how he's beginning to feather his hair on the sides? He's even trying to look a little like Redford. But this film is no The Natural. 7 of 10 stars.The Hound.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Enjoyable even if you don't know baseball,"I've never watched baseball in my life and so I had no prior knowledge about it but this film still managed to be quite enjoyable.Moneyball follows Billy Beane, the general manager of the Oakland A's, who builds a team on a tight budget by using statistics with the help of Peter Brand.I've heard how good this film was and the fact that it was written by Aaron Sorkin and Steven Zaillian got me excited. Despite my lack of knowledge of baseball, Moneyball was actually pretty good. I like the direction the film took by focusing less on the games themselves and rather on the work that goes on behind the scenes. Having Sorkin and Zaillian writing the script means it has to be good. This film could have easily been very dramatic but both writers manage to keep the story realistic with the right amount of wit infused.Once again, Brad Pitt does a great job and his chemistry with Jonah Hill was surprisingly good. I love Jonah Hill so it was interesting to see him take on a serious role for once instead of a comedic one. I thought he did well. His character is someone who's very quiet and shy and Hill gave a good portrayal of just that. I wish Philip Seymour Hoffman had more to do since his role is quite minor.Overall, Moneyball was a good time. I do feel the film is too long. A film like this where dialogue takes center stage, you can become easily bored and there were parts where I started to feel bored due to the slow pacing. I think some scenes could have been cut just to increase the pacing. Apart from that, the performances and writing did keep me engaged for the majority of the film and made it a worthy watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Brilliant acting and insight into sports management.,"Based on a book with same name written by Michael Lewis about the 2002 Baseball season of the Oakland Athletics, and their General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt). The film also stars Jonah Hill among some other names, such as Philip Seymour Hoffman. Both Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill put on fantastic performances in this film and are both deserved of their Academy Awards nominations. To accentuate the quality of the acting the film is very well directed and there is a fantastic script from Aaron Sorkin and Steven Zaillian. I think the film is very well edited and interspersed with some real life footage and flashback stuff to fill in gaps with the story. There are also some fantastic and interesting dialogue sequences. The film seems to offer an interesting insight into the sport of baseball and the management of sports teams. Especially the actual financial and logistical management as opposed to player management. This is another film that manages to get the audience (well, me at least) behind the team and the competitors in the sport. We definitely feel the adrenaline of the player victories. I enjoyed the performances and character interactions most in this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Two hours of dry shoptalk with Pitt on auto-pilot,"Moneyball is a slow moving chamber room film about the administrative and strategic aspects of baseball. Does it sound dry to you? Then you'll probably think it is. It's very down to earth, almost minimalistic in a sense, just lacking the emotional strength. Nothing is exaggerated, all the scenes are like normal everyday conversations.The acting style, particularly from the bit players is a mix between aping after documentaries/filmed real life conversations and the some poor TV networks drama of the week. The acting isn't exactly bad, it's just unmemorable and lacking strength. Jonah Hill is the only one here who gives a relatively good performance. Brad Pitt just seems like he's on auto-pilot and Philip Seymour Hoffman, who's barely even in the film, just blends into the background.The structure is fairly simple, it's basically all shoptalk, and relatively uninspired shoptalk at that, as Brad Pitt move from meeting to meeting. I think it's biggest weakness is the rather emotional score, which seems a tad sappy and banal. It seems to want to make up for the otherwise dry and unemotional business aspects, and takes every tiny opportunity to insert a tear in someones eyes.In a way I respect it, because it must have been really hard to get this movie made, but it just doesn't manage to be as good as it potentially could have been. It far from bad mind it. It's more than competently directed, it's Capote helmer Bennett Miller after all, and all the aspects are more or less decent. It even contains a few rather good scenes, which shows that they could have gotten it on the right track. So yes, I'm slightly disappointed. At high hopes for this. Won't write off Bennett Miller yet though. He could still have a great career in front of him. And it was nice to see Jonah Hill do well in a nice, toned down and quiet role. 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wonderful movie,"On recommendation from a friend, I recently saw Moneyball and thought the movie was quite great. The storyline is intriguing to say the least and though a lot of people already know the plot the movie made it come to life. The cast was great and specifically Jonah Hill, who usually does a great job in comedies, should get nominated for best supporting actor in it. It is nice to see him make a switch to a non-comedic role and I am sure this will greatly help his acting career.This is one of those rare movies that everyone should like, whether they are sports fans or not. The story is so interesting that it could not have been made up and the original author of the book was well represented in the screenplay. I read some commentary that this might not be as big as The Blind Side overseas because a lot of people aren't in love with baseball, but I think this appeals to all people even if they are not a fan.Overall, I think Sorkin did a wonderful job with the movie and picked a perfect cast-he has definitely been on a roll lately. Although I saw a matinée, I would have even liked it had I paid full price for my tickets. So, enjoy... :-)",,Anonymous,Biography
Baseball is a boring sport,"I used to be a fan, about sixty years ago when I would take the trolley to Griffith Stadium to watch the Washington Senators lose again. But there were some great players that beat them, Mickey Mantle, Ted Williams and Joe DiMaggio, who I discovered that in spite of my running as fast as I could to catch him for an autograph, could outpace me by his graceful effortless loping to the bullpen.But the game lost its charm over the years, and with expansion I didn't even know the names of the teams, who had had that old Senators franchise that bounced around the country. So, when a friend offered me his copy of this DVD, saying it was something special, I figured I would watch it and politely fib that I enjoyed it.Well, I shouldn't have worried. This was one of the finest films I've seen on so many levels. How they captured interactions from the G.M.'s relationship to his daughter, and his young adviser along with every one of his professional colleagues with such utter truth is amazing. Not a single false note. I compare it with the work of David Mamet, an esteemed film writer whose dialogue is his image of how men talk, with every other word four letters beginning with F. I've worked in setting such as the sales rooms of his film Glen Berrny-Glen Ross, and can attest that he was portraying caricatures rather than real people, unlike those dramatized by every single character in this film.From the original book, to the screen adaptation, to the acting, directing and editing---this was a gem, but beyond technical excellence it was inspired-as reflected by the fat player who tried to get back to first, not realizing that he had hit a home run. I don't know whether this really happened or not, and I don't care.It was a metaphor. Not just for this film, but for life.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Moneyball-management or the odd ways to beat sports odds...,"""Moneyball"", directed by Bennett Miller, respects the viewer's intelligence so much it elicits a rather unexpected non-emotional response towards sport. Sure it's one of these movies that are more about the business than the game and one thing for sure, the way odds never work as we expect is part of sports' beauty; still, the film isn't concerned about the beauty of the game.First, I'm not American, so although I've seen countless movies about baseball, the game is still total mystery for me. However, I know one thing or two about the laws of odds when it comes to sport and the particular mechanisms of sport business to understand the following: just because something is logical on the paper doesn't make it bound to happen on the field. Let's take an example in a sport I know a little better: football, or as Americans call it: soccer.Real Madrid had all the best players in the early 2000s: Zidane, Beckham, Figo and Raul to name these, it was their best team on the paper and yet from 2002 to 2006, before the Barça got Leo Messi, they didn't win the Spanish championship and they had to wait a whole decade before winning the Champions' League. Once again, all the boxes were ticked talent-wise but something was lacking in another department. And then they had Zidane as a coach for less than five years and they won the League four times, including a winning streak of three, a record. It couldn't be luck, it couldn't be the sole presence of Ronaldo who was there for at least five years before the first win, but something did catalyze his talent as well as the other players.This example proves that sports obey to certain rules that are less about reuniting than managing talents together and sometimes, winning isn't made of having the best players by any means but by getting the best game from any players. Because even a Real fan would admit that the Barça had the best team. So it's not just a matter of being the best and if you get that, you'll get ""Moneyball"", a film that relates the 2001 2002 season when the Oakland A's beat the odds and broke a record of 20 consecutive victories thanks to a new unorthodox approach from the manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) and his right-hand man, Peter Brand, a nerdy expert in statistics played by Jonah Hill (both will be Oscar-nominated for their performances).The duo defies the traditional scouting methods (consisting on picking the players with the best ratio of financial accessibility and ratings) through a new statistical approach of the game based on Excel tables and a meticulous examination of past results and combined percentages. So they manage to form an unlikely dream-team with players who were constantly overlooked, including some who never dreamed to play again. The core-idea is that at the right time with the right combination of factors, any team can win,;it all comes down to create these factors... and convince the no-nonsense coach Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman) to let the players play.It takes a while to make this ""omelet"" of victory and of course, it doesn't go without breaking a few eggs, and a few egos. Among the many things Brand learns about the business is to tell a player that they let him ""go"" and the quicker he gets to the point, the better... nothing personal and strictly business. The catch of that (no pun intended) is that everything works like a business and makes Beane's situation antithetic to a certain vision of sports. The film gives us a few hints about his youth when he was a 'natural' (à la Redford) who had all the makings of a champion, who abandoned school to be a professional and for some reason, never really took off and became an infamous casting error.Beane's paradox is that he had personal reasons to make his team win, he wants to matter for baseball and yet the methods he pulls are so mathematical, so rigorous that he reminds me of that quote about Ace Rothstein in ""Casino"" : ""he was so serious about it all that I don't think he ever enjoyed himself"" And that might be the irony of Beane, he takes the business so damn seriously that he seems dispassionate about the 'playing', only the outcome matters. It says a lot that he doesn't even watch the games. Pitt plays a paradoxical character whose hate for loss is stronger than his love for the game, which makes all the victories feel good and gratifying but not quite emotionally rewarding.""Moneyball"" was written by Aaron Sorkin and Steven Zaillan and you can feel both the cold/methodical approach and the human/character study touch, at the end, we have someone so serious about his job he doesn't enjoy it a bit. And Pitt has a way to play these characters who seem detached even from things they supposedly enjoy; that he's divorced doesn't even surprise... if he handled his marriage with Robin Wright like he did with baseball. At the end, the only person who seems to bring genuine love and fun is his daughter (Kerry Dorsey), which shows the only facet of his life that isn't made of regrets and dreams of revenge.Now, the film is based on a true story, which means it couldn't afford a different ending, but talk about irony in the end, we don't get the limits of Beane's approach of victory, but of ""personal"" victory, as an individual, not a manager. In fact, the ending proves him both right and wrong, and remind that just because you get the recipe doesn't make you a good cook for all that, and after all, even Zidane is struggling right now with Real Madrid.""Moneyball"" addresses audiences used to sports archetypes to better subvert them and through its philosophy of winning, it manages to create a rather uninspiring and depressing movie about underdogs, which is quite an achievement story-wise.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""They Get On Base""","I have to admit that Moneyball is one unique baseball film. Usually films are about players like Lou Gehrig, Grover Cleveland Alexander, or Dizzy Dean to name three of the most successful players that successful films were made about. But our protagonist/hero is Billy Beane here, a general manager who in his own way adopted a revolutionary approach to baseball that some consider as significant as Branch Rickey inventing the farm system.Beane is played here by Brad Pitt and he was a journeyman player who was given a scouting job in the Oakland Athletics organization which was the last team he played for. Beane gradually rose through the ranks and was now general manager at the turn of this century. What to do in the way of competing in this day of free agency with teams who have fabulously wealthy and spending owners like the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox in the American League.The answer comes from Jonah Hill who Pitt hires away from the Cleveland Indians organization and the key is on base percentage. However you get on base, hit, walk, error, hit by pitch or the occasional passed ball by a catcher, you're on and in a position to score. No flashy hitters with huge contracts in the Beane system, just get on base and get moved around.Of course on screen it works and the Oakland Athletics enjoy a sprint of success in the last decade. But imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and now a lot of teams are copying the Athletics.I could critique the system, but this is for movie reviews not a sports writer's column. And the film is a tribute to two men and the system they fashioned. Brad Pitt the visionary general manager and Jonah Hill the bean counter statistician who is an integral part of the success.Moneyball is unfortunately not a film that who are not sports fans or even baseball fans only can really appreciate. Still that's a wide selection of viewers it can relate to. It received six Oscar nominations including Best Picture, Best Actor for Brad Pitt and Best Supporting Actor for Jonah Hill. There's a nice performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman as field manager Art Howe. Hoffman's range continually amazes. You can hardly believe this is the same man who also got an Oscar for playing Truman Capote. He disappears into roles better than any other actor since Paul Muni.A film for baseball fans, but that's a large audience pilgrim.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
You don't have to know baseball to love this film,"Billie Beane was drafted by the Mets to be their next slugger. Or at least he looked the part. The only problem is he really wasn't the player they wanted him to be. So why did they draft him in the first round? The answer comes in a revolutionized method to see baseball called Sabermetrics.Fastforward to 2002, where he is a general manager for a team with one of the lowest payrolls in baseball. Its a team that can't buy its way to win, so they have to outsmart everyone including thier own team manager. He trades away their best players. He crashes the locker room with a bat when they are seen dancing after a loss. Beane becomes obssessed with winning.What ends up happening in Oakland will be a model for how to win in the modern MLB era. The team of scrappy blue collar players begin winning. How many wins? MLB Record Setting wins.As history is being made, everyone begins to witness a transformation away from the traditional way baseball is viewed. As Oakland begins competing with big market teams, they begin taking notice of Billy Beane. And finally, as a general manager, he is able to over come the demons of his days as a failed ball player.Believe it or not, this is a love story. As the big market teams try to pull him away from the small market in Oakland, he has to make a decision as to where his heart is. The answer to this comes in the final few minutes of the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
a different kind of sports movie,"Going in, I knew this wasn't the typical sports movie, and I thought I probably wouldn't like it that much, but it turned out to be a good movie and a neat idea. Instead of focusing on the baseball team, the film focuses on those that build the team, specifically the GM, Billy Beane, played by Brad Pitt. It's one of Pitt's better roles.Beane enlists the aid of Ivy League graduate, Peter Brand, in picking ball players. There budget is small compared to other teams, so they look for players that are good at getting on base, and other teams undervalue, ie...won't have to pay them much. Through using a whole new idea to build a team, they are eventually proved successful.I'm surprised this movie didn't win the Oscar for screenplay, It deserved it. As for the acting, it was OK, but I didn't think Pitt or Hill were anything special and really didn't deserve any nominations. Especially Hill, whose role is to play a nerdy, computer geek, with hardly any emotion and a monotone voice. I don't think that says Oscar.FINAL VERDICT: A new type of sports movie. Definitely check it out.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
FANTASTIC,"Very well made film. Keeps you engaged and has tons of brilliant emotional scenes. Jonah Hill is terrific in a more serious role than I'm accustomed to seeing him in.

keeping the faith,"Baseball and submarines: American cinema seems to thrive in these two arenas. Baseball may be a minor sport globally, its rules lost on the vast majority of Europeans, Africans and Asians, but in cinema it lends itself perfectly to myth and grand narrative. Pragmatic GM Billy Beane comes across a nerdy Peter Brand who seems to have worked out an algorithm to get the most effective baseball squad for the lowest cost. This is just what the cash-strapped Oakland franchise needs, decides Beane. Philosophy meets strategy in a perfect pairing, as Billy and Peter go to work implementing 'moneyball' with an almost religious zeal. Pitt brings his now taken-for-granted charisma and complexity to Beane. The casting of Jonah Hill is a gamble that pays off as he manages to give Peter a backbone, when it would be all too easy to lampoon this character. And when you have Philip Seymour Hoffman stepping up to play a small but crucial part, then you have a movie that is intriguing and compelling in equal measure. Very few people have the courage to choose a transgressive path, and of those that do, fewer still will stick with it in the face of adversity. A film of quiet determination, with occasionally explosive conflict, it is at all times humane and authentic. One to watch again and again.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
I've never watched a baseball game but I love this film,"Great film. I've seen it around 5 times and it's still good.

Yes! a good sports movie.,"First of all, I am not a baseball fan, so I guess my opinion should count a little. In fact, I am not even aware of the rules of this sport. But you know what? I really enjoyed Moneyball. Being based on a true story, you just know that there has got to be a good enough reason for that story to be turned into a movie.In Moneyball, you don't get to see that much baseball action though, for it shows you the other side of the sport. You get to see the bureaucracy and the extent to which a GM needs to go to be able to compete with wealthier teams. His new approach when recruiting players make him a few enemies along the way, and the majority of his staff seems uninterested in helping him make a good run for the title. His only help (in fact the source of his inspiration) comes from a young economist from Yale who has zero experience in baseball, but both of them are about to embark on a journey that will change the history of baseball forever At least that's the impression I got.As a result, the movie is one of those that leave a long lasting feeling. Most of us will relate to the protagonist and feel that sometimes, all you need in adversity is to see things from a different perspective, especially when the big fish is way bigger than you",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Let that guard down, Billy. Let it down.","SYNOPSIS:
Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) is the General Manager of the Oakland A's Major League Baseball team and is left with the hefty task of rebuilding a championship contending team after losing their 3 best players and with a very limited budget.REVIEW:
PLEASE don't be discouraged to watch this film just because you're not a fan of baseball or math. The performance from Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill along with the emotional drive this film has will carry you through. Brad Pitt portrays Billy Beane is a way that you can see he really tries to conceal his absolute love for his team and the game. When he's around people and even when he tells them for his love of the game it comes off disingenuous. You get these little moments where it's just him and the camera where you see the true passion. This is where the great acting comes to play. When an actor takes a character and allows the audience to connect and understand what's behind a character and his decisions. You get one scene where you see the final straw and he has an outburst around others. You get flashbacks of when he was a player and they're not overly long or out of place and rather than distracting you from the film, like how a lot of flashbacks do, it actually connects you a lot more to Billy. You can piece together why he's a little guarded now, because he knows that just because things may seem perfect, they might not always turn out to be. This lack of accomplishment he feels that he's always been promised, but hasn't fulfilled even though everyone else feels the exact opposite. He's blind to how he's impacted the game, because he never impacted it in his way and you see this in a metaphor that Peter (Jonah Hill) shows him near the end of the film.This film was just released on Netflix and I highly encourage anyone who loves film to watch this regardless of how you feel about the topic at hand. The acting is marvelous from Brad Pitt, to Jonah Hill, to Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Ken Medlock and the rest of the cast. Then you also get a lovely little side story of a father and his daughter and so many other elements that cultivate into an incredible film. 9.4/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A welcome passion project and a successful commentary on greed,"Being a football fan (that's 'soccer' to any Americans reading), it has been an increasingly frustrating past decade or so seeing the sport turn into a greedy, money-orientated business. The gap between the rich super-clubs, and the smaller teams that have been forced into becoming 'feeder clubs', is becoming larger and larger with every progressing season. The takeover of Manchester City a few seasons ago by Arab oil tycoon and politician Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nayhan saw the club spend over £150 million in one transfer window, and now sit second in the league as a result, with a host of superstar playboys littering their team-sheet. This transformation from sport of the working classes to a capitalist business is the focus of Moneyball, but the sport is baseball, America's equivalent to football.It tells the true story of failed baseball player Billy Beane (Brad Pitt), who is now General Manager of Oakland Athletics, a team who are struggling to keep up with the pace of the New York Mets, a rich club who have just nabbed three of Oakland's key players. Disillusioned with the financial distance between the clubs, he approaches Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), a Yale-graduated economics analyst who seems to have made a breakthrough studying statistics rather than player valuation. Brand suggests three out-of-favour has-beens and rejects to replace one of the superstars they lost, to which Beane obliges. Oakland become the laughing stock of the sport, until they go on a winning run which will soon break all baseball records.Like I said, I am a football fan, and I love to watch the game. But my love of the game is hampered by feelings of self-loathing as I watch these over-paid primadonnas whine and dive their way around the pitch, while earning more in a week than I will in twenty years for kicking a piece of leather around a pitch for 90 minutes. Billy Beans shares this view. He says 'it's impossible not to be romantic about baseball', but he has watched the sport he loves become merely dollar signs in the eyes of suit-wearing tycoons who treat it as something to play with in their spare time. Beane does not want to simply win a trophy, a ring, or a record, he wants to change the way the game is run.Pitt became involved in the production way back in 2007, and became almost a labour-of-love for the actor. He also produces as well as giving an impressive performance. It's alarming how he has transformed himself from a mere pretty boy of the 1990's, into a passionate actor and producer, starring in excellent films such as Babel (2006), The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007) and Inglourious Basterds (2009). He received an Oscar nomination for this film, as it's fully deserved, portraying Beane as a mixture of determination, eagerness and concern, as well short-tempered rage. Jonah Hill is also excellent, following his creepy performance in Cyrus (2010) as the dutiful, super-intelligent Brand (he also received an Oscar nomination).Moneyball is a welcome passion project that goes as far as translating the love of a sport that escapes us Brits. Although there is very little focus on the playing of the sport itself, it makes it clear why the sport is loved so much and is seen in such a romantic light. It does for baseball what the underrated Friday Night Lights (2004) does for American football. The script by superscribes Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin is suitably fast-paced and complex, giving the film a weight and a darkness that made The Social Network (2010) so good (in Sorkin's case). Informative, insightful, and occasionally gripping, UK audiences should not shy away from this film due to the sport, and instead embrace a film that tackles larger issues of greed and class division.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Good, But I Would Not Friend It.","""Moneyball"" got the paddles of life taken to it by the same screenwriter that worked the Facebook movie, and it shows in the quick quip dialog. This is a good thing and the movie is cute and entertaining a chuckle at a time. It does not really give the actors anything Oscar worthy to deal with though, so nothing bad to say about the acting, but no hip-hip-hooray either.As a baseball fan I found some of the movie interesting, but overall I felt like the insider access was not as interesting as just watching MLBtv and long periods of time were passed over without me really getting invested into the drama of it all.This is a good, entertaining movie, and worth a rent, but it's not a ""time and time again"" sort of flick to me and seems like a strong contender for A title at an amazing $5 price at a retail store less than a year after release to home video.

A Film About Baseball That Easily Transcends Its Game,"A film about baseball that effortlessly transcends its game, an interesting study of the clash between the conventional & new approach, and a highly polished drama that packs in a lot of heart, soul & inspiration, Moneyball is a fabulously crafted, expertly narrated & brilliantly performed picture that enters the film arena as an underdog but leaves everyone surprised by the time it finishes, much like its subject matter.Based on actual events, the story of Moneyball follows Billy Beane; the general manager of Oakland Athletics who's given a low-budget team to prepare for the upcoming season. Very disappointed with the limited payroll, he hires a new assistant and decides to put his radical theory to test when it comes to scouting & analysing players, eventually putting together a team of undervalued players who later go on to script history.Co-written by Steven Zaillian & Aaron Sorkin, and directed by Bennett Miller, Moneyball is a big shot of inspiration that hits many home-runs over the course of its runtime and features Brad Pitt in one of his strongest roles. The screenplay is a pure gem and Miller does a terrific job in transitioning it on the silver screen for his direction here brims with confidence and he approaches the story with a clear vision of what the film needs to be.The technical aspects are firmly executed under the director's supervision. Set pieces are finely detailed, shooting locations carry an authentic feel, Cinematography makes excellent use of its camera to capture all the action on & off the field, and also gives it a grassy visual flair, Editing keeps the plot real tight & gripping and provides a favourable pace to the whole narrative, while Michael Danna's score makes its presence felt only when it's required.Coming to the acting department, Moneyball features a reliable cast in Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill & Phillip Seymour-Hoffman, and all of them chip in with commendable performances. Pitt is the real star here for he commands the screen with full authority and performs his duties with finesse. Hill also delivers a strong supporting work as assistant GM while Hoffman is at his usual best and the chemistry these three actors share with each other lifts the story up by a great deal.On an overall scale, Moneyball is one of the best films of its year & amongst the finest examples of its genre that benefits most from its impeccable writing & solid direction. The rejection of unorthodox ideas, the errors in management style, the continued use of outdated methods & favouring polished pebbles over diamonds are few of the elements that goes beyond the arena of baseball and Moneyball makes these points heard loud & clear without preaching it. An intensely captivating & thoroughly entertaining experience, Moneyball comes highly recommended.",,Anonymous,Biography

But on this film, I am just at a loss. It is a very good film, but it by no means deserved to get a Best Picture nomination. And Jonah Hill tried to expand his range and escape his typecasting, which is great. But Best Supporting Actor? Hardly.I also tend to agree with Roger Ebert, but he gives this film four stars. I would have stopped at three. He says, ""Jonah Hill's performance is understated and fascinating"". Understated maybe. Fascinating?

"How could you not be romantic about baseball? (...By not watching it, I suppose)","My only ever baseball experience was memorable for being unmemorable. I sat in what I was told was a 'bleacher' seat. In my native England, a bleacher seat would be a prime location from which to view a live game. But bleacher seats are so named because there is no roof covering them, allowing the sun to bleach the riff-raff who occupy them. I walked out before half-time (if indeed there was a halfway point).Bennett Miller's 'Moneyball' has good and bad points, just like his 'Capote'. Sure, there are parts which engage, but there are also parts which repel.Brad Pitt plays Billy Beane, general manager of the real life baseball team the Oakland Athletics, or Oakland A's. They're a middle-of-the-road sort of a team, destined for nothing except mediocrity. After losing their big chance of winning a championship title, Beane has to sell some of his key players to keep the club financially stable. Only, if he does that he can kiss goodbye to any chance of winning anything again.The intriguing thing about 'Moneyball' is that it takes us from the pitch, through the locker rooms and further until we get to the back office where the real game is played – a game of backhanders and backstabbing. 'Moneyball', I think, introduces to the screen the quirky concept of sport management via a computer.The biggest reason why I can't recommend this film over other ones currently on release is Brad Pitt. When it comes to Beautiful Brad, I'm in a minority. I don't think he's a great actor. He's more a personality, as De Niro would say. If you look at his filmography, I bet you couldn't name a film where if he wasn't in it it would be a poorer picture for it. 'Fight Club' is as good as he'll ever be. And I bet my journalistic career that he will never win a competitive Oscar.Aaron Sorkin and Steve Zaillian's script is weak by their standards. There are lines of dialogue which stand out, but you can always spot good lines in an ordinary script. Zaillian is used to adapting his screenplays from books, whereas Sorkin has the skill to write one from scratch. The script isn't poor, you understand; it just isn't worthy of either man.Beane's shrewdest managerial decision is to poach Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), a player analyst from a rival team. He's a softly spoken, obsequious young man, who's a bit of a dark horse. He has an economics degree from Yale and understands baseball better than anyone else Beane has ever known.Brand explains to Beane that throughout history baseball managers have been wrong. They are blinded by celebrity to the extent that they dismiss most players because of their age, appearance or personality. Brand persuades Beane that, if they view players as statistics rather than as celebs, they can assemble a championship-quality team. You could say that Brand is the brains behind the A's' recovery while Beane is the face. Naturally.Sorkin or Zaillian (who knows which?) does manage to slip some nice dark humour into characters' lines. This along with Jonah Hill's performance would be a reason to watch the film. In real life he's an extrovert, so it must have been hell to speak only when spoken to. In one scene, Beane points to him all cool and managerial-like, tacitly wanting to him to confirm something he's said in a meeting. Brand points to himself and says 'Do you want me to speak?'. The whole audience loved this kind of gag.A quick-fire negotiation scene featuring Beane and Brand is impressive. Or do they speak so quickly that the scene only seems impressive? Either way I won't be watching it a second time to find out.The film focuses on too many different characters. It gets lost in its own details. Toning down the success the A's' go on to achieve would have made sense (20 consecutive wins, although true to life, is too schmaltzy to be taken seriously in a film). It's a sporting cliché otherwise.The ending was a sell-out. I gather Beane wanted desperately to win with the A's. As a player he was as star manqué, so winning a championship with them as GM would be his salvation. The offer made to him by the Boston Red Sox was so similar. They, too, were a losing side who needed Beane to take them to a championship. He could have easily gone back to the A's; it's not like they would have turned him down. (The Red Sox used his (Brand's) model anyway and won the title without him.)I don't want to sound like I hate Brad Pitt (I don't think anybody does), but I have to be honest. Speaking honestly, then, how long does the camera have to be held on Pitt's eyes before he sheds a tear? His way of conveying the regret his character has is to exercise more than any of the players and break a lot of things. Also, can anybody tell me why Pitt eats in virtually every scene of every film he's starring in lately? What kind of trademark is that? This is a man who topped a great actors poll above Brando a few years back. And people wonder why I'm so cynical about the state of cinema.www.moseleyb13.com",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Sporting Economics.,"I have no affinity to Baseball as a sport, I'm British you see. I tried to get in to it when British cable networks began showing it, but it never grabbed me. My only contribution to any conversation about the sport is that I support The Cleveland Indians because of the film Major League, a film that continues to make me laugh to this day.I was intrigued by Moneyball, synopsis tantalisingly offering up a sports success story based on an improbable blend of maths (something I hate with a passion), guile and perceived misfits as a team. Sure enough, after viewing Moneyball it has landed joyously onto a personal favourites list.Unsurprisingly, when digging into the actual facts of the Oakland Athletics 2002 season at the core of the story, I found truths stretched, some character portrayals toyed with, and omissions to round out a better story. But crucially, the key element here is the moulding of a team for what in Baseball parlance is financial peanuts. This makes their 20 game wining run as being an outstanding achievement.The mathematical aspects of the story are easily explained via the interactions of General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) and his economics right hand man Peter Brand (Jonah Hill). Baseball operations behind the scenes are given fascinating clarity via the tremendous screenplay (Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin). And ultimately the blend of on field action, family relationships and team assembling flows beautifully as one.In turn punch the air brilliant with heart tugging worth, and brainy into the bargain, Moneyball most certainly a film non Baseball fans can watch and maybe love for bringing something new to the sports movie table. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great surprise,"I usually do not like movies designed for broad audiences, but man, this was great.Writing and direction are fantastic, as in ""how to make a great movie out of almost nothing"". The story is quite your average sports quest for success, but the dynamics of the events, the attention for every single scene, the depth of Brad Pitt's character, several great lines, some clever humor, and the fantastic use of noise and silence in the closing scenes, all these things contribute to push this movie well above average. Photography is beautiful. Acting is fantastic, Brad Pitt could still act and delivered a great performance. Same for Hoffman and Jonas Hill.Definitely recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
What exactly makes this a good movie ?,"After watching this movie, I'm really amazed at it's pretty much stellar reputation. I didn't see anything here that I haven't seen a thousand times over. You might credit Moneyball for side-stepping some of the big sports-movie clichés, but I can't go as far as to call it compelling. Granted there are some very decent performances here -especially from usual suspect Hoffman- but then most characters do little more then talk about dry facts and figures. Not exactly challenging stuff for an actor. This is mostly due to a very lackluster script; there's plenty of conflict but none of it gets fleshed out in a meaningful way. Apart from one climactic sequence nestled uncomfortably far from the eventual ending, tension or drama is mostly absent. We get to see extremely little baseball, instead watching TV-screens, spreadsheets and boardrooms. Crucial points in the season pass by before you even realize the story has jumped past them. What you're left with are flashbacks that don't seem to have much connection to the present and business-meetings in which the main characters never even get challenged properly. Character development is limited to Pitt's character re-enacting scenes from Californication with his daughter for a pitiful pay-off.I'm not a fan of baseball, so maybe lovers of the game get much more out of this then me, but I can find little to recommend here. The way I see it, Moneyball does to movie-making what I understand it does to baseball: it sucks the life out of it.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Realistic View of the Front Office,"This film does a great job of introducing us to one of the most unconventional factors in the world of baseball. That is, the career of Billy Bean, who was the kind of general manager who had the gift of putting a team together based on normally overlooked talents. Along the way he and his financially gifted cohort (who really knows baseball) must face a hundred years of baseball tradition. They are cut off at every point by the manager who selfishly plays it safe, looking only after himself. The point is that a baseball season is longer than long and a great many nuances contribute to success. The strength of this movie is the realistic portrayal of the baseball world, particularly the relationships among the players and the front office. It also shows that a general manager, despite a position of importance, can still be seen as an insignificant person when things don't go well. It's truly, ""What have you done for me lately?"" The interesting thing is that a mediocre ballplayer and unknown GM made changes that affected baseball forever.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A great story with quite some depth,"I'm not a baseball guy. Quite frankly, I barely understand how the game works. But, somehow, I never got lost. Sure, the script plays a huge role in it and I have no doubt the actual story is quite a bit more contrived and complex but that is not all there is.
The terrific acting from both Pitt and Hill make it so the baseball itself serves as a background for the story while the actors guide what you are supposed to feel at the moment. You don't really have to understand if it is good or bad because they will show it to you.
That, paired with a great script and an incredible story, make this a flick way more interesting than simply a sport moment. A great watch with some very touching moments.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Best Baseball Movie Ever!,"Brad Pitt surprised me as Oakland A's General manager Billy Beane in this film about actual events. Jonah Hill does a superb job as Peter Brand, the Yale educated assistant manager. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is great as the head coach. Hoffman was a great loss as an actor. Billy Beane is a real person. This film is about a two hour love story about the game. This film is for baseball lovers too regardless of what team you're rooting for whether the Oakland Athletics, the New York Yankees, or the Boston Red Sox. The accolades were well deserved for Pitt and Hill. I am not much of a baseball fan to begin with or a sports fan at all but this film made me enjoy the game which can for hours and seven games with a rival. This film is not about money which has overtaken baseball but the love of the game. This film shows how a small underpaid team like the Oakland Athletics can be David to New York Yankees' Goliath.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Only for team sport fans, probably...","I am not into sports, baseball is totally unknown to me and random short clips about this game have not increased my interest. I decided to watch Moneyball due to several Academy Awards nominations and some great actors - but the result is mixed and so-so feeling.Brad Pitt is good as usual, but he has had more interesting and complex parts (e.g. in Burn After Reading or 12 Monkeys or Inglorious Basterds). Philip Seymour Hoffman and Robin Wright are too briefly on screen. Jonah Hill does good acting, but his part is often numb. The other performances and just average and some characters add nothing to the logic of the plot (Pitt / Beane's family, for example).As for the script, it is slow at times, and the ending is too protracted and odd. Additional points from me because of real events and characters.Thus, it seems that Moneyball can be enjoyed by basketball fans, in the USA, above all.

God bless this movie.,"It's as patient as a baseball game, and 100 times more engaging. For a movie so focused on numbers and sports analytics, it's incredibly soulful.

Pitt is equal parts unnervingly stoic and subtly impish, and his sudden outburst of anger are wonderful.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""An island of misfit toys""","""There are rich teams, and there are poor teams. Then there's fifty feet of crap. And then there's us"" Billy Beane coldly states at a meeting early in Moneyball. Beane is the general manager of the Oakland Athletics, which in 2002, were the lowest-salaried MLB team, that began their season with eleven loses in a row. If it hadn't been for Beane's devotion to the team and the excellent crew working alongside them, the team may have likely spiraled down to become one of the worst performing teams in MLB history.Beane (portrayed excellently by Brad Pitt) was recruited as a player to the MLB at a young age, and after failing to drum up much attention, was assigned the A's GM in 1998. After losing to the New York Yankees in the 2001 postseason, Beane continued to seek out other options, hiring the Yale-educated Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), working as an assistant for the Cleveland Indians at prior to this, to work as the numbers-cruncher for the team. Brand quickly pulls up a list of ""misfit players"" that should be going for a higher price, but are ostracized because of their quirks. Even on a limited budget, they recruit a number of lesser players and went on to compile a team that would win twenty games in a row, the highest winning streak of any MLB team in history.Moneyball closely examines Beane and Brand's tireless game with numbers, how both of them faced opposition from the A's manager Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman), and despite being overwhelmingly successful at the game, Beane's constant dissatification with the team as a whole, even saying that winning twenty games is meaningless unless you win the final game of the season.The one person he continues to keep close to him is his young daughter, Casey (Kerris Dorsey), who becomes increasingly worried about how her father could do so much to help yet remain mostly unmoved by it all.Writer Aaron Sorkin pens Moneyball with a rare side of cynicism not only from Beane but from the sport of baseball itself. The complexity of the game is stunning, the statistics sometimes brutally unfair, and the stress and anguish of it all, unfathomable in every sense. I rarely attend major league baseball games, and usually stick to the humble, but sophisticated Midwest League when I am hungering for baseball. I'm sure the stress is there about as much as it is in the bigger ballparks as well.Sorkin, who penned The Social Network just a year prior to this, continues his streak of taking a questionable premise and making it interesting, informative, completely understandable to anyone regardless of interest or education, and shows the importance of slick, flowing dialog from character to character.Moneyball is a wonderful work of supreme intellect, on a subject that more often than not spawns a by-the-numbers story. Pitt is increasingly favorable as Beane, Hill works wonders with the dramatic screenplay, and Hoffman brings yet another fabulous performance to the table in his string of successful ones. And even when one of those three are not taking screen (which is a rare occurrence), we still get wonderful, stylistic visual flair. This film has it all.Starring: Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill, Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Directed by: Bennett Miller.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A good behind-the-scenes movie about baseball.,"In general, sports-themed movies are not strictly my piece of cake, I prefer to see other things. But this film already had an interesting list of award nominations, which includes six Oscars (Best Film, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, Best Editing and Best Sound Mixing) and three BAFTA, with in none of these cases it came out victorious. And the truth is that there are a lot of very good films in which the theme is sport.The theme of this film is quite simple and, however, very well-used: the director of a medium-sized baseball team finds himself in the need to recruit new players and, to a certain extent, compete on an equal footing with stronger teams. And with more money in their pockets to spend. In order to balance things out, he rethinks the entire team's strategy, from the way they recruit and evaluate players to what goes on the pitch. Therefore, it is a movie about baseball, but with very little action and game played, which is not exactly what sports movie fans prefer. I personally liked it, because it gives us an idea of what goes on behind the scenes of these high competition teams, in the offices and in the dressing room. And it was interesting to see how math, statistics and number analysis can be decisive in choosing certain players and game strategies. A subject of little interest, which seems dry and too technical, has thus become an excellent screenplay.Brad Pitt is a good actor and uses all his charisma and presence in this film. The actor is able to lead and guide us through the entire film and ensures a very satisfactory performance throughout the entire production. Also, Jonah Hill does a pretty good job as a creative mathematician who seems to be in the least likely position for a numbers man. On the other hand, I didn't particularly like Seymour Hoffman's work on this film. I think the actor was not given material to match his abilities and had little screen time and very little to do. So it's not the actor's fault...The direction of Bennett Miller does a generally decent job, and ensures a very good pace to the film, with a dynamism that prevents the film from falling into the doldrums. The cinematography is very sharp, dynamic and colorful, and the sets are very good, especially the countryside and the bathhouses, with all the details. The sound effects are quite good, and the soundtrack is discreet but competent.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Beane pretty much changed baseball negotiations as we know them.,Had this movie in my collection a while and finally got around to watching it today. One of the best films i have seen on the profession of baseball yet. Kudos to both Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill for stellar acting jobs here. Supporting cast ain't that bad either with realistic jobs done also by Phillip Seymore Thomas (Who has a head coach look down perfectly) But both the acting jobs done by both Pitt and Hill are very believable and a storyline which was incredibly interesting and no you don't even have to enjoy watching the sport to know what's going on as i once heard a woman friend say.Pitt plays Oakland A's longtime GM and former Mets player Billy Beane. Beane is named the Oakland A's GM and attends all the draft meetings with the look of utmost boredom until one of the other brass pretty much ask him what his problem is he asks each and everyone of them if they know what the current problem is that was surrounding the team. After no one can come up with an answer he tells them that the problem especially with the Yankees is that they spend millions on all star talent who once hired don't do a thing as to where he teaches them to look at the guys who are hard workers and can actually get to the base and that are not asking for much moolah in return.Little does Beane knows is he will start what is now more or less precedent in baseball today when it comes to acquiring talent from any pro ball roster. He through yet another meeting concerning draft talks he acquires assistant Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) from The Boston Red Sox who adds his own pick and great wisdom to the then 2002 season. A good film overall that can be proudly on display with other great pro baseball film that have occurred.,7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Delving into and bringing a fresh take on a sports film, Miller along with writers Steven Zaillian, Aaron Sorkin, and Stan Chervin achieve a well balanced story full of laughs, drama, and heart. Pitt brings one of his best interpretations of a character to life hosing in on the insecurities while bleeding out the confidence and sure-fire wit. Hill delivers his best performance of his career and one of the most surprisingly brilliant turns this year. He even manages to steal scenes from co-star Philip Seymour Hoffman, who is just as good as ever, and have the viewer hone in on his wonderful acting portrayal.

A Redundant But Good Sports Movie Hitting The Bar By The Tip,"7.2/10Moneyball is at its essence a good attempt at making a sports movie hit all keys. However, unfortunately it's only good with too many factors bogging down this other wise relatively good showing.Brad Pitt is amazing and gives a stellar performance as Billy Beane and his quest to change the game via statistics. Brad Pitt gave an amazing soul searching performance that left me deeply invested in him and purely him. Purely him. I had no real interest on any character as the story choose to focus nearly entirely on him. Albeit the story is primarily based around him, we see little to no interactions outside of some key events which hinder the movie.Also the movie isn't told in any brilliant way. It's the classic sports movie told a thousand times over. It's redundant.That being said Brad Pitt being most of the screen time as Billy Beane is good. He does an amazing job portraying the character and does keep me invested in the A's performance and also Chris Pratt as Scott Hatteberg is also very warming. Love his character.Overall a pretty good movie but it being a commonplace in the industry and it not striving for anything new can only lead it so far. Good movie all things considered .",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Who knew that Steve Zaillian was capable of writing such an impersonal screenplay?,"When the Academy Award nominations are announced in January, there will be two people involved in Bennett Miller's ""Moneyball"" whom I will be rooting for. Not only that, but given the picture's late-year release and the Academy's habit of voting for fiscally successful pictures, I am sure that Brad Pitt will garner his third Academy Award nomination and that Jonah Hill will claim his first. The movie is certain to score big in the other categories as well, however, I must reserve my enthusiasm for Mr. Pitt and Mr. Hill alone. For it was only through their great performances that any energy at all was built up. They are also due credit for the few great moments that nobly attempted to save the whole picture. The sad news is that, for me, ""Moneyball"" was an overly cynical exercise that did not bring up anything new about baseball or the people in it and left me feeling rather left-out.Leaving Mr. Miller's adequate but unremarkable directing aside, the core fault of the picture revolves around a question I continued asking myself over and over again: Who knew that Steve Zaillain (the writer of ""American Gangster"" and ""Schindler's List"") was capable of putting together such an impersonal, non-involving screenplay?I am usually a sucker for sports movies because of something that has been with the genre since the beginning: inspiration and heart. Remember, this is coming from the same reviewer who gleefully recommended ""Gridiron Gang"" five years ago. However, that uplifting and exciting trend is completely absent in Mr. Zaillian's screenplay, who substitutes moody cynicism in its place. Now of course, the movie is about what Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane did to assemble a team that would go on to hold a record winning streak and not so much about the game of baseball itself, but what it does show us in its behind-the-scenes stuff is rather downbeat. It starts out moody and ends moody. And while this is not necessarily a bad thing (and can be done wonderfully for dramatic effect) the effect here is overall limp and impersonal. Where Mr. Zaillian also fails is what has become his trademark: information. Compare the screenplay with ""Moneyball"" to his impeccable writing and bucket-loads of fascinating, hard-to-find information for ""Schindler's List"" and the contrast is staggering. We learned a lot about Oskar Schindler and the Holocaust in that great Spielberg film, but we learn very little about Billy Beane and the general managing of a baseball team that we could not learn from just picking up a newspaper or an almanac. Where is the dope? Where is the emotionally-gripping background plots? For that matter, what has become of the fascinating character dynamics? What little we get is between Mr. Pitt and Mr. Hill, the former as general manager Billy Beane and the latter as his statistics assistant Peter Brand. Mr. Pitt has a daughter in the film, but there is no real chemistry between them, nothing that has not been seen done better in so many other, more confident films. Robin Wright, a charming actress, is given next to nothing to do as Mr. Pitt's ex-wife and Phillip Seymour Hoffmann is merely something in the background, even though his role as the disgruntled A's coach is meant to be an important factor. And although the movie tackles the subject of the general manager having to trade off and let go of players, and tries to use this for dramatic effect, we learn so little about the players of the A's that they frankly could have been extras. That makes the introductory scene to one of them, where Mr. Pitt signs him onto the team, even more pointless than it already is.Only one scene in ""Moneyball"" takes place in the rain, but you would never know it by the way Wally Pfister has photographed the images. Mr. Pfister has made his mark, and won his Oscar (for ""Inception"") by using low-key lighting and vast shadows. However, he overdoes it here. In fact, it's rather amateurish. Every shot in the picture looks as if no lights outside of the staged environment were used at all. It looks grainy, like something shot on a home video digital camera. At times, the shadows crossing Mr. Pitt's face as he ironically stands in sunlight threatens to guise the wonderful expressions he is generating for his performance. The only moment where the drabby lighting works is in a shot where Mr. Pitt is driving at night, at which point we can only see the outline of his face and the reflection of streetlights in his eyes. That is terrific. But the rest is so gloomily-shot it really becomes tiresome.Mr. Zaillian's screenplay rambles on and on, but what it had to say was not so interesting that it deserved, I felt, so much attention. The movie clocks at a little over two hours in length and the second half of that seemed much longer than it really was. I must again commend the efforts of Mr. Pitt and Mr. Hill, who are so charismatic and so excellent in the film that they actually managed to produce some lively moments, especially early on in the film. But then, that's when they are being spontaneous. By the end of the movie, where they are just speaking in hushed voices, and the moodiness becomes sappily overwhelming, I was left to sigh over and over again in the auditorium. The movie has its moments, but I would be much happier seeing ""Remember the Titans"" for the umpteenth time than revisiting this coldy impersonal film.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

A New Way To Think,"I've been a baseball fan for the better part of two decades. As such, I vividly remember the events surrounding the 2002 Oakland Athletics that are the prime content of this film. ""Moneyball"" does an incredible job of recreating the nostalgia of those events, as well as telling the story behind them that likely was not known at the time.For a basic plot summary, ""Moneyball"" focuses on the character of Billy Beane (Brad Pitt), the GM of the Oakland A's who realizes in the early 2000s that he can't spend with the ""big boys"" (e.g. New York) that comprised his competition. As such, with the help of Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) and to the consternation of A's manager Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman), Beane uses the statistical analyses popularized by Bill James to build a team capable of dethroning the Yankees on a shoestring budget.The hallmark of this film is that, to the viewer, it really won't matter if you're familiar with this story. The narrative works either way:If your a newbie to all this ""baseball-o-nomics"" stuff, ""Moneyball"" does a great job of breaking things down and giving you the ""Reader's Digest"" version of the Moneyball concept. You don't even have to be a baseball fan to ""get it"", as Beane's mindset and principles can be utilized in many walks of life.For those (like I) who devoured ""Moneyball"" in print form, it is just flat out amazing to see the events played out on the big screen. Those of us who have been intrigued by the whole concept since those ""early years"" can sit back and be amazed by how it has truly changed the game. The fact that a great deal of actual baseball footage is used only adds to the effect.About the only nitpick I can possibly find with this film is that the choreographed baseball scenes are not always entirely accurate. This is a small nitpick, of course, but one that bugged me just a bit considering how easy it would have been to fix.Overall, ""Moneyball"" is a fantastic re-telling at perhaps the most revolutionary concept to ever be introduced to the sport...using in-depth statistical analysis to mine for talent that may be lost to the human eye. Whether a hard-core baseball nut or just a casual movie-goer, ""Moneyball"" will impress you...just in different ways.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A record winning streak with a team of losers and cranks,"A biographical sports drama, the prototype of which was the general manager of the Oakland Athletics baseball team, Billy Bean. His image was embodied by Brad Pitt, and this role is rightfully considered one of the best in his career.The plot was based on Michael Lewis's bestseller ""Money Ball: The Art of Winning in a Dishonest Game"", which tells about the method of choosing professional athletes based on the statistical analysis of ""sabermetrica"". The film received high marks from critics and viewers, and was repeatedly awarded prestigious nominations.The film skillfully adapts the documentary into a work of fiction, placing conflicts and obstacles in the way of a hero who puts his career ""on the line"" and does not want to put up with defeat. As a pioneer, he breaks down the wall of prejudice and misunderstanding to prove to himself that baseball is more than just a business.Despite the fact that the picture has a more personal character, it quite inventively and interestingly explains the internal organization of sports life, pragmatically prioritizing players and managers, as well as explaining everyone's point of view. This is not a colorful show that wants to entertain the audience with gambling fervor, this is a story about a man ""here and now"", about his experiences and feelings through the prism of professional ambitions, a retrospective analysis of the past and a look into the future.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A Wonderful Story of Innovation, Perseverance and Thinking Outside the Box","Moneyball centres around former highly-touted pick Billy Beane who has risen through the ranks to become the GM of the small market Oakland Athletics in the early 2000s. Major League Baseball lacks a salary cap so there is a huge disparity from the richer/most popular teams (New York Yankees, Boston Red Sox etc.) to the smaller teams like the A's. The A's develop great young players but when the off-season comes around, the team is raided by the richer teams for those newly popular/successful players. This handicaps the A's ability to compete and Billy Beane has had enough. Through a meeting with Cleveland Indians GM Mark Shapiro, he meets Peter Brand (who was a real person but his name was changed for the movie) and he discovers sabermetrics (a mathematics based approach to evaluating players that places importance on statistics like OBP instead of more conventional metrics like batting AVG and HRs). After acquiring Brand's services, they blaze their own trail to remake the A's roster with a restricted budget by signing players who other evaluators discard because of their ""quirks."" Moneyball is an underdog story which doesn't centre around a playoff push or a championship team. It's about this front office that completely went against the grain by embracing a less than popular stance. That you could ""card count"" your way through the system and accumulate wins through efficiency and selective scouting as opposed to splash signings and a huge payroll. Beane and his team were relentlessly mocked by the rest of baseball and the media for this approach but eventually they were proven correct as they were still a playoff team consistently while only having a fraction of their competitor's bank accounts.Moneyball centres around our protagonist Billy, his co-conspirator Peter and their efforts to reshape the A's. I could see some people checking their watches listening to the synopsis above but I find the story fascinating and the material uplifting. Their initial efforts weren't met with support or hope, the A's were publicly derided and they were called every name under the sun. The movie does an expert job of tying this humiliation back to Beane's own career as a baseball player. The disappointment and inner-torment he suffered when he couldn't live up to expectations is harrowing and Moneyball shows how that shaped him into the person we follow in this movie. This movie can be heart-wrenching at points yet it's done in a manner that isn't too overbearing or manipulative. These guys could have abandoned their approach halfway through and it may have been easier. But because they had the courage to think differently and understand something that few could, they changed the game. Not just baseball but every major sport needs more innovators and trail-blazers, ""it's an unfair game"" Bean posits to his scouts in the movie and the only way that cycle is broken is when new routes are discovered.Brad Pitt is not only the star but he helped produce the movie as well. He shines in this movie and he does so without making Beane a completely likeable character. Beane is an angry and uncompromising hard@ss throughout Moneyball but Pitt is so charismatic and does such a great job of showing his inner torment that you can't help but root for him. Jonah Hill gives a quieter and more reserved but equally impressive performance as Peter Brand. This is the movie that showed what he could do as a dramatic actor and he does a fantastic job of showing Brand's evolution under Beane's tutelage. He also works really well with Pitt and they make a good team. Phillip Seymour-Hoffman does exactly what the script calls for as the curmudgeonly Art Howe. I really like Chris Pratt as Scott Hatteberg, the scene where Beane arrives at his home and offers him a contract is fantastic as a result of Pitt and Pratt's acting. Chris is still comedic without laying it on too thick in Moneyball. I also enjoyed Robin Wright as Beane's ex-wife Sharon, I wish we got more of her in the movie but I feel like some of her scenes must have gotten edited out. Ken Medlock doesn't have a pleasant role as Grady Fuson but he does a great job of clashing with Pitt as well.I would usually talk about the minor flaws or small missteps Moneyball makes in this paragraph but I believe that there are so few. The first is that Moneyball's pace is more deliberate and contemplative than your typical studio fare. It's not bursting at the seams with action or over-the-top drama. This is a quieter movie that isn't afraid to take the more scenic route or to let you ponder over the choices of Beane and Brand while the next scene gets underway. The pacing didn't bother me but it may irk some others. The other quibble I have is that they omit/change some of the details about the 2002 Athletics for the sake of the drama. The A's had a dynamite starting pitching staff (Tim Hudson, Mark Mulder and Barry Zito would all compete for Cy Young awards), Art Howe wasn't as much of a stick-in-the-mud as portrayed and Miguel Tejada was having an MVP calibre season. While their approach to analytics and gaming the system was revolutionary, it wasn't the only reason for their success. I love the movie regardless but keep in mind that this version is very much Billy Beane's view on what happened. It's a dramatization of true events as opposed to a documentary.""How could you not be romantic about baseball?"" Billy Beane asks the audience this when the movie is rounding into it's conclusion. Moneyball doesn't include all the facts and it is a more wistful movie about sports than we usually get. But it's such a fantastic story about a seismic shift in how we approach America's pastime and the courage it took to see the vision of a few mavericks through. I also want to credit director Benett Miller, director of photography Wally Pfister and writers Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin for their exemplary work shooting and writing the movie. There are moments in this movie (the scene between Billy and Peter after he gets back from the BoSox meeting comes to mind) that I would put up against any other sports movie out there. The acting is marvellous throughout and the subject matter is more inspiring every time I watch it. If you can get over a few factual inaccuracies, this is a triumph of a movie and I cannot recommend it highly enough. Moneyball is one of my favourite sports movies period and I've revisited it regularly since I caught it in the theatre many years ago.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good for baseball fans,I was a baseball fan growing up. Not nearly as much now but I still follow it from time to time. This movie kind of touches on the analytic movement big in the sport today.I still remember the 2002 Oakland A's. Jason Giambi just got signed with the Yankees and they had to come up with out of the box ways to cope. I would add though that that team still had very good strong pitching at the time. Which is why I think Beane is a little overrated in real life.Nonetheless it's an enjoyable watch for baseball fans. I was impressed with the attention to detail for the 2002 A's in the film as the players mentioned were all real.,7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Good movie, but when you look into it is false","I personally have a very large problem with this movie. It portrays Art Howe as pompous, stuck up person who came from money. That is not true at all. He is actually a very kind, caring person whose character in the movie is not like him at all. Sadly, his portrayal in this movie, ended his managing career that was becoming very successful. I think the movie is good if you don't know Art and truly know how good of a man he is. It is quite sad that he is portrayed so bad- for this reason only, I refuse to support the movie and give it a good ranking. Yes, I have know Art my whole life and he is considered family to me, however I feel everyone should consider how biased the movie is before watching it. He is still upset to this day about that movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent movie about changing the rules to win,"Excellent movie. Tells the story of the resurgent Oakland A's under Billy Beane's leadership when his winning team had just lost key players (Jason Giambi, Johnny Damon and Jason Isringhausen) to deep pocketed and large market competitors, and the A's couldn't replace them with comparable talent due to financial constraints. The solution? Replace them in aggregate rather than player-for-player by focusing on new metrics that had not previously received much attention and algorithms that were not feasible before computers. Scouts and managers still generally inhabited that prehistoric world - at least before Beane. There's a lovely scene with Brad Pitt's on-screen daughter singing a song with resonant lyrics. Brad Pitt is stellar in his acting (and in his appearance at TIFF, together with someone called Angelina.)",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Brilliant,"I must admit that I was very sceptical about Hollywood making the book into a movie. I enjoyed the book immensely, but did not see how it could be made into a movie.I was wrong, very wrong. Moneyball is brilliant!The adaptation of Michael Lewis's book by Aaron Sorkin et al is imaginative, yet doesn't take much poetic licence versus the book. Bennett MIller, directing only his second movie (the first was ""Capote""), keeps the movie moving, and doesn't get bogged down with some of the minor details. A faithful reproduction of the book would have been dry, and a documentary.Brad Pitt provides the star power and puts in a good performance. Jonah Hill is surprisingly good in a dramatic role. Good support from Philip Seymour Hoffman and Robin Wright.Very entertaining, and ultimately thought-provoking and uplifting. Yes, I am a baseball nut, but I don't that being one is essential to enjoying this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
I have No Clue how Baseball Works,"I am British and in Britain we don't have baseball so I was lost whenever they talked about anything to do with the game, still I was interested in the use of statistics and economics so thought that I might enjoy this film. The film is ok and I enjoyed the first half that was focused on those statistics but when it started focusing on the game and Brad Pitt's relationship with his daughter I wasn't too interested. The acting is all good, I like Jonah Hill and Brad Pitt's chemistry, Hill is quite quiet and understated while Pitt is loud and overbearing but the two of them together are really great, apart from that I don't have much to say, maybe if I had an interest or any knowledge of the game I would have enjoyed the second half more but the statistics element of the film is hardly present in that second half and the statistics were all I was really interested in so... 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Some minus points for deviating from reality?,"Terrific script and a movie packed with top-notch acting performances and life lessons that are able to keep anyone engaged whether you know baseball or not.Like any other better sports movie out there, Moneyball gave a lot of insight on the ups and downs of the dog-eat-dog world of pro sports accompanied with hidden themes of persistence & courage to go against all odds (or to defy reality) to achieve success. Unlike most other sports movies, but similar to The Wrestler, Moneyball is not made to overglorify sportsmanship and showed that things do not end up in your way all the time.However, knowing that the same people who was behind 'Social Network' -- a movie that disappointed me -- was involved in this, I had to be skeptical on how accurate Moneyball portray the real people behind these characters. (NOTE: the movie claims to be based on true story, IT DID NOT HIGHLIGHT that it is based on the novel or other material) Like Social Network, I noticed immediately many things in the movie are quite dramatic, which is not a good thing if that causes it to stray too far from reality. For example, the real Billy Beane did not wore those fashionable attire or tracksuit (as done by Pitt) but look more like stolen from his stats assistant's wardrobe instead. Whatever... I have decided to let my final ratings be determined by how the actual people themselves felt about the movie. A quick browse online, I found Billy was satisfied with his character in the movie, Art Howe was offended, Scott Hatteberg did mentioned some things were incorrect in the movie, and I do not know if the sabermetrics guy felt okay with it. Hence, 7 stars is a good compromise from what looks like a 8-9 star at my first glance.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Metaphor,"Leaning over an introspective Brad Pitt as Billy Beane confesses to his assistant GM Peter played by Jonah Hill, "" It doesn't mean anything."" Pitt's Billy frames the context if his Oakland A's don't win it all. In the Big Picture, Billy gets it. And so does Director Bennett Miller in ""Moneyball"". Steven Zaillian (""Searching for Bobby Fisher"", ""Schindler's List"") and Alan Sorkin (""The Social Network"") wrote the screenplay based on Michael Lewis's book, ""Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game"". Bennett's ""Moneyball"" is about altering the way people think, and the genesis of leadership and greatness. ""Moneyball"" is one of the best movies of the year. Brad Pitt is awesome.""Moneyball"" recalls the story of the 2002 Oakland A's and their record breaking 20 game win streak, following the gutting of the team due to superstar free agency. The joke is that the A's much like other small venue franchises have become farm teams to the Yankee's, who have a $100 million plus payroll. Unlike other professional sports, the baseball salary cap void is indicative of Lewis's book's title. Brad Pitt plays Oakland A's GM Billy Beane, who was supposed to be baseball's next superstar when recruited back in 1979. Zaillian and Sorkin delicately weave that narrative thread, and Pitt eloquently evokes the regret of unrealized possibility. What makes ""Moneyball"" so amazing is that it is more than just a baseball movie. Bennett subtly cops to this at the movie's catharsis when Pitt says to Hill, ""I get the metaphor."" It is about the romance of the game, about forging the greatness in people.""Moneyball"" works because of Brad Pitt. What is refreshing is that he isn't asked to play unattractive here to be taken seriously. In fact he looks great and incredibly lean and fit, at his charming best. Pitt is amazing in communicating in his silence, whether he turning his back to the camera or in one scene as his eyes glaze over as his scouting staff discards a potential prospect, because he has an ugly girl friend—obviously has low confidence. In a radical move Pitt's Billy hires Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) as his assistant, after discerning his critical acumen in a negotiation. Hill lands perfectly with Peter's humble genius and earnestness. Peter is a Yale graduate with a degree in Economics. Peter's revolutionary paradigm is that in baseball you don't buy superstars, you buy wins. More specifically, you buy runs, hits, and walks. Given the $38 million salary of the A's, you are literally creating a team of ""misfit toys"". Peter's brilliance lies in analyzing the statistics and getting the undervalued talent. Pitt and Hill have amazing chemistry. They are funny together, and their underlying bond is respect. This is part of the touching humanity of ""Moneyball"".The other humanizing relationship is Billy with his young daughter Casey (wonderful Kerris Dorsey). Dorsey is the authentic shy teenager. She lives with her Mom, Billy's ex played by Robin Wright. Pitt has a natural fatherly partnership with Dorsey. Pitt has a beguiling charisma that is never overshadowed by kids. Together as Casey sings Billy the song she wrote for him, unpredictable movie magic emerges.What I found so inspiring about ""Moneyball"": its soul is about reclaiming one's innate greatness. Billy and Peter acquire 37 year-old David Justice (commanding Stephen Bishop) in the twilight of his career. Pitt has a come to Jesus meeting with the aging superstar. Billy points out that Cleveland was willing to pay half his salary for him to play elsewhere. He admits to Justice that he is also gone if this experiment in Oakland is a bust. Pitt looks him in the eye and says, ""Be a leader."" This is just awesome stuff. Leaders generate other leaders, and alter the way we view the world. Pitt is amazing. He is uncompromising in his passion and humanity, and he delivers with humor and heart. This is a wonderfully scripted movie by Zaillian and Sorkin. Director Bennett elicits authentic performances from his impeccable cast. On the surface ""Moneyball"" maybe about getting things on the cheap, but it is really about seeing the best in people. ""Moneyball"" is more than just about baseball, it's about life. ""Moneyball"" is one the best movies of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

I love the way that Billy take risks for success. Good movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A nice character study with a great performance.,"Moneyball isn't a baseball movie. Hell, it's not even about baseball. The sport sets itself as the backdrop for a character study about the man behind the curtain; Billy Beane, the general manager of the Oakland A's circa 2001. For a film that is so grounded in the American pastime, it's interesting to note that there is only one game that is displayed prominently in the entire film, nearing the end of it's runtime. Moneyball isn't a sports movie, it's about this one man and his road to redemption, bringing us through themes of change and courage and led by a superb performance from Brad Pitt.The film, as written by Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin and directed by Bennett Miller, doesn't lend itself to any of those big Oscar moments you'd expect, but instead finds beauty in restraining itself. Pitt is the perfect actor for their representation of Beane, a combination of charm, humor and bitter resentment towards a system that chewed him up and spit him out as a young man. There's so much going on inside this man and Pitt carries it with the right amount of brooding gravitas, charming charisma and graceful perseverance. He's a delight to watch and he carries a film that could have easily fallen apart without him.Overall the film was an enjoyable, easy watch that never got a chance to truly shine for me, which I attribute mainly to Bennett Miller's direction. He understands what makes this different from a sports movie but he doesn't give it enough of a spark to make it stand out at all. I wish there had been more of Sorkin's usual sharp dialogue but we got was enjoyable, I just wish they had chosen a director who wasn't so vanilla. It would have been very interesting if Soderbergh had stayed on. There are a few small details that really tore me out of the moment (a brief cameo, the concept that Beane's daughter writes a song that was a pretty popular hit eight years after the movie takes place) but the thing that I think holds it back from getting anywhere sensational is Miller.Still, that doesn't mean the film is bad at all. In fact, I was surprised by just how good I found it to be. With Pitt taking the lead and a fine supporting cast to back him up (Philip Seymour Hoffman was the only one that I took much notice of, but no one turns in a bad performance), Moneyball is a vintage character piece with a lot of heart. It took about half it's running time before it really picked up steam, but it never managed to bore me or make me check the clock. It's not a tremendous film by any means, but I think it's definitely a pretty good one.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Terrible, TERRIBLE misleading film. Spoilers.","Once again Hollywood reinvents history.Search the 2002 Oakland A's. Compare that roster to the 2001. There are four, even five names that are almost completely absent from this script, which is why this is a terrible movie.This flick makes you believe that the A's were successful due to the free agent signings, trades and other moves made by Beane and co. Makes you believe? Make believe is more like it.Barry Zito, Mark Mulder and Tim Hudson were NOWHERE in this film. Oakland had a run of four to six years where these three horsemen were dominant in the American League. Their minor league coaches AND SCOUTS developed these guys. Their starting rotation was POWERFUL.And how did the A's replace Giambi? They did not replace him in the variables, through out the lineup. To be blunt, they didn't. And with Eric Chavez and Miguel Tejada batting 3, 4 they didn't really need to. Oh, and did I mention Mulder, Zito and Hudson?I know the salary of the A's made a great headline but the truth is the A's were just in a baseball demographic where several talented young players all bloomed during the same period.To suggest their success was due to Beane and their miser owner skimping on a few million here or there is ridiculous.Oh, and the biggest joke of the movie was Brand dissing Johnny Damon. Did anyone watch ANY of the 2004 post season? I think he had a few hits in the 2007.Overall this was a fun movie, I mean for a non fiction or just partially based on a true story.But to tell this story, the way they did, in my opinion it should have been a little league tale. Something like, the big bad rich neighborhood lures away all the good players from a team and the coach has to go to all the poor neighborhoods to get players... Like Blue Chips.

Suspenseful,"I have absolutely no interest in baseball. Thinking that this film would be about that boring sport, I steered clear for years. I am so glad that it was mentioned in a recorded seminar on screenplays, as it is well worth anyone´s time. In fact, it is hardly about baseball at all. Brad Pitt does an excellent job, as do Jonah Hill and Philip Seymour Hoffman (RIP). The primary focus is on overcoming odds and being willing to take risks in pursuit of one´s dreams. Along the way is a convincing portrayal of how bold thinking is always rejected as crazy by conformists. Without being preachy or didactic, the film offers much bigger lessons, applicable to human life in general. The film is in fact an extended metaphor about the struggles faced by anyone who attempts to excel and runs into obstacles all along the way.

Moneyball is about an underdog that wants to revolutionize the most popular sport. Nobody believes in this plan. He gets hurdles on his path. Yeah you got it, it may sound like any other story.
But the thing is Brad Pitt. He believes so much in the story and his part, which is pretty unusual in his career. He puts so much belief that he takes viewers with him, and even those who aren't really into baseball.
Because it's not really about baseball, it's about fighting the system. It's about trying new schemes, moving forward. It's about courage and determination, going against the flow and maybe making history.

Strategies in professional baseball in years around year 2000,"This is a movie about baseball set in the America of the years around 2000 when the clash between teams Oakland Atheletics and NY Yankees was in progress. GM of the Oakland team Billy Beane ( Brad Pitt) is in conflict with his scout group due his disagreement over selection of players. He feels that the methods used are outdated and subjective.( Scouts would typically use 5 tools for evaluation, that is can he run, field, throw , hit and hit with power ? ) Billy meets smart young Peter Brand ( Jonah Hill), a Yale economics graduate who uses saber economics methods rather than discussion and brain storming to evaluate the players. Using economics and statistics Billy and Peter then form a team to weed out non effective players and recruit lower valued but promising players much to the displeasure of their scouts group. Initially there are reverses ( teething problems ) but things start looking up with many wins along the way.Director Bennet Miller uses the talents of both Brad and Jonah to set up an engaging narrative of plans, promises,efforts, firings, recruitments, conflicts, victory, defeat ,frustration etc. There are interesting scenes on what happens behind the scenes during formation of baseball teams with budget constraints and the strategies used in order to win. Brad Pitt performs superbly as the impatient, curt, terse, animated, GM who won't accept no for an anwer.( I hate losing ,he says). He doesn't watch matches himself in a type of superstition. His love for baseball makes him say "" How can you not be romantic about baseball ?. Brad must have a scene in his films where he is eating, has his mouth full and says his dialogue. This also happens in a scene in this movie. Matching Brad is the cool and calculating ( pun intended) Jonah Hill whose understated dialogue delivery is very effective. Both Brad and Jonah have given award worthy performances and were rightly nominated.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Moneyball is a great film about the virtue of pursuing your dreams, even if logic tells you otherwise, which stands in conflict with the main plot of the film, which focuses on Billy Beane (played by a note perfect Brad Pitt) a boss trying to introduce objective analysis to baseball, a sport where evaluation still relies heavily on feelings and innuendo.It's in the conflict between Billy Beane's emotional ""need"" and his logical ""want"" were Moneyball shines.

Well Crafted If At Times Tedious,"I understand this film was based on a book and respect the makers choice to be faithful to such. The movie was very well made, paced, scripted, shot, etc. But I could never get behind Beane's character; i.e., I could never feel his drive, be sympathetic, etc. The fact that there was no score to the movie also detracted from my enjoyment. The topic and circumstances just were/are neither important nor serious enough to warrant the moody, agonizing emotional throes we appear to be encouraged to see. Critically, while I believe Beane built a successful team, I'm unconvinced his data-crunching experiment was strictly responsible for such as the success might have been in spite of it.The story, topic, etc., would have made an excellent 90 minute light drama with more laughs and a bouncy soundtrack.

I don't mean to say that the acting was bad in this movie because it wasn't, but the story told was insanely inaccurate to the point of being complete fiction.They intentionally left out the fact that this A's team had one of the best pitching staffs in the big leagues(Zito, Mulder, Hudson, and Koch). They had two perennial all stars on the left side of the infield and hitting in the middle of the line up(Tejada and Chavez).This A's team had a great team that had nothing to do with the philosophy presented in this movie. These great players are why this A's team had so much success yet they did everything they could to keep them out of the movie.This whole movie was made about a philosophy that flat out did not work, yet people are praising Billy Beane for this great season.

A Staple for Sports Fans,"Everything I know about baseball stems from a childhood playing Wii Sports - home runs are good, and if you get three strikes you're out. So in Moneyball when Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill start talking about players ""getting on base"" and the like, I didn't have much of a clue what the script was. Nonetheless I still found the plot of the film to be very interesting and gripping, I just felt more could have been done to help viewers lacking in baseball knowledge understand the jargon getting thrown around.Jonah Hill isn't credited enough for his range of acting, as he plays the intimidated and awkward Ivy League graduate stats man Peter Brand. I loved the on screen relationship between him and Pitt - it really stood out as one of my highlights of the film. Pitt himself is charismatic as ever, his character Billy Beane fleshed out with a compelling back story that alongside his passion and utmost desire to win brings the viewer fully onside, supporting Beane all the way. That's what makes Moneyball such a feel good flick.Overall I thoroughly enjoyed Moneyball and was grossly invested in the themes on display. It provides a fascinating insight into how major sports teams function behind the scenes and has successfully convinced me to take more of an interest in baseball. I'd recommend Moneyball to any fan of sports, not just baseball, as the financial inequalities throughout teams in the MLB can quite easily be reflected in any major sport - particularly football.If you're smart enough to realise how the story and themes of Moneyball are applicable to the sport you love then you'll enjoy Moneyball as much as I did. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

A great movie to fall asleep to!,"There was nothing engaging about this movie. The characters were bland. The cinematography was nothing to marvel over. I understand that real life isn't always as engaging as we'd like it to be, but it worked for the Blind Side. I fail to understand why these directors couldn't make it work.For some reason, the actors seem to have been directed to be silent for 3 seconds after anyone talks. Why? There was so much awkward silence in this movie! It left the audience giggling nervously. It added nothing to the plot or character development. If the silences were taken out, I guarantee it would be an hour shorter (and a lot less painful to watch). The film also seemed to lack a sufficient musical score. Scenes that would usually have been made more exciting by background music were played out in complete silence. It's very difficult to be excited about a plot development when the makers of the movie don't seem to be either.The characters spoke in monotone. None of them struck me as likable, perhaps bar Billy Beane's daughter. Billy frequently becomes unjustifiably angry, throwing sports equipment at walls for dramatic effect. It all seems very fake and scripted. There's so little dialogue in this movie, I barely feel like I know any of the characters. If we're meant to rely on Billy Beane's facial expressions to get a sense of what he's feeling, then Brad Pitt doesn't do a good enough job.Overall, it was a snooze fest. I kept looking at my watch, hoping it would soon be over. Don't see this movie. Wait for it to be shown on TV. You can watch it while reading a book, or doing the laundry.

Every player is worth something,"It's the end of the 2001 season and the Oakland A's just lost the American League Division Series. To add insult to injury, they have just lost their star players Johnny Damon, Jason Giambi and Jason Isringhausen. Needless to say, the Oakland A's and their General Manager Billy Beane (played by Academy Award Winner Brad Pitt) is caught in a rut, and it doesn't help that he has the lowest salary constraint in baseball. If they want to win the World Series, they have to come up with something new. Eventually, he and his new assistant Peter Brand (played by Academy Award Nominee Jonah Hill) shake up the game when they use statistical analysis to place value on the players that they pick - a decision that has their entire scouting team and coach (played by Academy Award Winner Phillip Seymour Hoffman) up in arms about.This is a great film. Plain and simple. This film was nominated for a number of Academy Awards and, although it didn't win any, it clearly deserved each nomination. I don't know much about Sound Mixing and Film Editing, but kudos to those guys also getting some Academy love! However, let's start with the writing. First off, amidst two other guys, one of the writers is Academy Award Nominee Aaron Sorkin, who also penned A Few Good Men, Charlie Wilson's War, The Social Network and Steve Jobs. Needless to say, this guys is a natural talent, and it was good to have him on here. Academy Award Nominated Director Bennett Miller is a master of knowing how to use his actors in each scene he directs; his movies are all about character development, and they delve into the psyche of each character. He really should've been nominated for Best Director for this film over Terrence Malick for The Tree of Life.But of course we must now turn to the actors involved. First I want to start off with some of the more supporting actors in this film. In one scene, you have Golden Globe Winner Robin Wright who, in her one scene, is absolutely amazing :) Then you got Chris Pratt, who is especially well known for his portrayal of Star Lord in the MCU, Emmet in The Lego Movie franchise and Owen in the Jurassic Park franchise (yes I know he's in Jurassic World, but let's face it, that's an entire franchise from 1993 - present); he does a good job with the limited amount of lines he's given. But now to the main three actors. First off to Phillip Seymour Hoffman. He plays the General Manager Art Howe, a man who is a traditionalist; he believes that baseball was built on the greatness of the scouts and players. Hoffman captures the gruffness very convincingly; he is a great actor who is still sorely missed. The biggest surprise to me was Jonah Hill. The mark of a great actor is when they can pull off different genres. While Hill is most well known for his comedies, this was his first non-comedy movie, and the next year he would star in the action-comedy 21 Jump Street. Needless to say, I believe that Jonah Hill will be considered a great actor in the years to come. I was hesitant to see him in this role, but he knocked it out of the park and he was excellent as Peter Brand. But of course, most of the credit has to go to Brad Pitt as Billy Beane, the sports GM who is looking for a way to change the game in their favor, since it is his job that is on the line. If his way doesn't work, he will be out on the streets. Pitt conveys the desperation that Beane went through at that time; you can see the pain of a man who was once a promising young baseball player but who ended up being a disappointment. He really wants that ring on his finger, and he is willing to pull out all the stops to do it. Kudos to Pitt for such a great job!Overall, go and watch this movie! It is a great movie!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
For baseball lovers this is a great watch,"For the baseball fan stretches of Moneyball are more than engaging - seeing how Beane constructed the 2002 out of the ashes of the 2001 edition, which was ravaged by free agent departures; watching losing baseball becoming the winning variety; and re-living ""the streak"" - a 20-game odyssey that made ""Moneyball"" a common word in baseball circles. Non-baseball lovers may enjoy the proceedings but are likely to be less impressed than their sports-savvy counterparts. It will be interesting to see how much of the early Academy Awards word-of-mouth is transformed into late-innings buzz and, ultimately, into Oscar gold. Brad Pitt is very good and along with The Tree of Life he has shown that a typical award worthy role doesn't have to be a mentally handicapped or a paraplegic or a raging alcoholic- He is the guy next door here. Jonah Hill provides worthy support in a non-comedic turn.",,Anonymous,Biography
Batter Up,"Not the best baseball movie I have ever seen. That honor belongs to ""The Sandlot"", however this one is a fascinating look at scouting, drafting, and general baseball management. Acting is good. Not sure that Jonah's performance was that awesome - he simply wasn't smoking a bong or getting stabbed at a kegger, which I think surprised some people. The tension of work and family does show up and adds a nice human element to the film. Mixed in with some baseball highlights of the actual events can add more power for the A's fans out there. Worth a watch if you like baseball or play sports video games and love building the teams up more than actually playing the games. If you don't know what I am talking about this movie may not be for you.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""I hate losing more than I love winning""",I played 'rounders' for fun at primary school and that's the closest I've ever been to sister game Baseball. This is a great story about believing in and sticking with the chosen direction even when the chips are down. It's also a story about being a great dad which is well-played and has a decent soundtrack too. Thoroughly enjoyable even for non rounders fans.,8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Good biographical film, but I didn't get all the baseball refs","Enjoyed this, although didn't understand all the baseball references. Basically a true story of a baseball GM who tried a new computer-generated statistic analysis to put a potentially winning team together on a low budget compared to teams such as the Yankees or the Red Sox. Set in the Oakland Athletics, Brad Pitt plays Billy Beane who was an ex player turned scout who finds Jonah Hill the Stanford Economics genius who has developed the equations and such to set up the system. Pitt, Hill and Seymour Hoffman were great, understated characterizations, Pitt bringing his eat & act modus operandi to the character, which always makes me laugh. It wasn't as gripping as some sports films, as it's about the people rather than the game, but exciting enough to follow the team, with some illustrated back story of Bean's career and also about his life out of the dugout (not that he is ever IN the dugout) with a cameo from Robin Wright as the ex-wife. His daughter was cutie with a good singing voice. Well directed film written in part by Aaron Sorkin - which didn't surprise given the tight economic script. Good biographical film.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"I despise baseball, but love this movie",'Moneyball' is wondrously crafted and so much deeper then its surface of sport and economics. An extremely effective and touching screenplay with the marvelous performances of Brad Pitt & Jonah Hill carried this film. I typically don't enjoy movies that are designed for broad audiences but I sure loved this one. 'Moneyball' could be the greatest depiction of sport business in cinema.,8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Beane on toast.,"Despite being a big Aaron Sorkin fan, I hadn't actually seen ""Moneyball"" prior to this viewing, nearly 14 years after the films initial release. I found it a little dryer than similar films about politics or business, though maybe that's my general disinterest in Baseball rather than the fault of the film.Feeling that he's taken the Oakland Athletic Baseball franchise as far as he can on the budget he's allowed, Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) is facing losing three star players to higher paying teams. Looking for a revolution, he meets Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) an economics graduate who believes firmly that baseball is misunderstood by those in the game and that using statistical analysis he can build a successful team utilising unfashionable players within their budget. The pair though meet resistance to the tactic, both from the former players who make up the scouting structure and the teams manager Art Howe (Phillip Seymour Hoffman).Whilst I wouldn't say the film grabbed me like ""The Social Network"" or ""Molly's Game"" did, I did enjoy ""Moneyball"". It's a great central performance from Pitt and is chemistry with Hill is really strong. It helps that Oakland had a really interesting first season under the Sabremetrics plan, losing consistently at the start, then going on the longest winning streak in the history of the game - which was completed in the most dramatic fashion possible. Despite not being that familiar with Baseball it was easy to follow what was happening in the games and the data driven recruitment methodology as transcended Baseball to be used in all sports - though, gloriously, sport still has the x-factor of human frailty that stops it from becoming over predictable.Again, it's just that little bit dryer that other Sorkin scripts, and the dialogue doesn't quite pop in the same way. I'm glad to have finally gotten around to it, but I can't see myself revisiting it as often as some of the others.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Best Baseball Movie,This movie was a great baseball movie. It is probably the best I have seen. The story is about a guy that wants to win the last game of the season.I thought the movie was done great. Brad Pitt played a huge part in this movie. He was the producer and an actor. Christ Pratt was also in this movie. This was one of his first. It was probably one of his best though. His charter in many scenes made you feel like you where going to cry because you where so happy for him. The story was pretty much the same as of what really happened. The score in this movie made you get really involved. That is what a score needs to do.This is one of my favorite movies and one of the best baseball movies. This is also one of the best documentaries ever..,9.0,Anonymous,Biography

HAVE A BALL,Movies done right make themselves known and this is the case. Good acting carries the movie theme and of course the game of baseball does the rest. I would describe this as a feel good movie and it lives up to its name. Your emotions will travel in the up and down mode but its a work-out and not a consistent plot to rock and sock you. It comes across as the way life is and can be. Highly recommend a snack and tasty drink while watching I mean after all this is about baseball.

A Different Kind of Sports Movie,"Moneyball (2011)*** 1/2 (out of 4)The true story of Oakland A's General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) who after his team is eliminated by the New York Yankees decides he has to come up with a way to compete without spending the money. Enter a Yale graduate (Jonah Hill) who has come up with a way for a small-market team to get players without paying the high price tag. MONEYBALL isn't your typical sports movie. Most sports films would concentrate on the players or have an inspirational coach but this time we take a look at the behind-the-scenes stuff that most fans never get to see. What makes MONEYBALL so fascinating really isn't the personal story of Beane but instead it's the day-to-date operations of a General Manager. I think most of those not familiar with baseball are going to enjoy the story of Beane who must fight a few of his own demons while trying to field a winning team. What is going to be so interesting to baseball fans is seeing how a General Manager goes about making trades, cutting players and how he must determine the best way to field a winning team. Of course, it doesn't hurt when you've got someone like Brad Pitt who once again proves why he's one of the most interesting actors working today. Pitt was always great playing these laid-back types and that calm and collective nature really shines here. I really enjoyed the way Pitt goes about playing not only Beane's demons but also how he eventually comes to enjoy what he's doing. Hill is also very good in his part and I enjoyed the light comic touches he brought to the film. Philip Seymour Hoffman is also very good in his role of the manager but I do feel that the screenplay doesn't do enough with his character. The same is true for Robin Wright; a fine performance but the screenplay does nothing with her role. Those who follow baseball will know how this season in the film turns out but this really doesn't take away from the entertainment. There's some nice human drama along the way and baseball fans will certainly like all the famous names being dropped. MONEYBALL isn't your typical sports movie but it's a fascinating look at parts of the sports we never see.",,Anonymous,Biography
Dull story about a dull sport,"I usually love films with a sorting theme, but this one left me cold.
Yes, I get that he chose a team based on stats and therefore went against common wisdom, but that's about the whole movie summed up in a sentence. There's barely any actual on pitch action. What there is requires you to know the intricacies of baseball. Pitt is ok in what is a relatively easy role to play. It's also long, so long - at least 30 minutes of the film should have been left on the cutting room floor. About an hour in I wanted it to be over and was dismayed when I realised we weren't even half way through. Leave this alone unless you're a baseball fan, there are other options.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
It's Hard Not To Be Romantic About Baseball!,"I'm not a fan of Baseball. Actually, I don't even know anything about this game. I'm also not a big fan of Sports movies in general. Also, this movie has a generic story that could have easily made Moneyball already dated. That's why I putted this movie off for a very long time, and I really regret doing that.Director Bennett Miller, along with screenwriters, Steven Zaillian, and Aaron Sorkin took a story that sounds uninteresting and turned it into an enjoyable movie that is funny, intense, and very touching in equal measure. I didn't know that Aaron Sorkin co-wrote the script but I felt his touches while watching the movie till I became completely sure that he co-wrote its script even before I check that out.The dialogue is so smart and sharp, and Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill were both great, especially Brad Pitt, and they had an incredible chemistry that made the dialogue even more captivating.Let's face it, no director-screenwriter collaboration can beat Fincher-Sorkin's one. But that , by no means, means that Bennett Miller didn't do a great job directing this movie. Besides the fact that he made a very good-looking movie, he captured some truly magical cinematic moments that can stick in my head for a very long time. A very long sequence near the end, in particular, that is about ten minutes is easily one of the most riveting and gripping sequences I've ever watched. I was literally on the edge of my seat sweating, and putting my hands on head. It was really stressful and exhausting to watch. Also, the moments Billy Beane, Pitt's character, has with his daughter are just delightful to watch.Nevertheless, Moneyball's problem, IMO, is that it's a bit boring! Its runtime is 133 min, and the movie definitely could have been way shorter. The problem is that there is too much talk that I really wasn't interested in, and most importantly, didn't need to. The movie lost me sometimes at the middle and the very end.Billy Beane is a well-written and grounded character that brought to life by Brad Pitt's Oscar-nominated performance. It had a lot of development, and it was a very interesting character. That being said, I felt that his backstory isn't complete. I think it was interesting at the beginning, but then the movie just ignored his past. As a result, I felt like there was something is missing in this character. The movie actually did keep advancing his backstory forward in a way that connect very well with the ongoing events of the movie, but that, unfortunately, didn't happen after the first act anymore.Overall, I loved Moneyball so much, and enjoyed watching it quiet a bit, and I didn't even think that I was going to like it.(8/10)",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not a bad film but the point was strange,"Not a bad film but really the point was kind of strange and seemed to promote statistical marketing which has really limited our selection of restaurants, stores etc... It also demonstrates that budget isn't everything to the game either.Production-wise this film must've been on some kind of budget where they couldn't afford to do a lot of lighting. Over-all the cinematography is very dark, flat and uncomplimentary to the story. This includes outdoor shots. Compare it to the cinematography of ""The Natural"" or ""Field of Dreams"". This seems like a strange place to cut from when your film is on a budget.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Well Made,"To be honest, I've tried to watch this movie a few times, finally completing it sometime a few years ago. I found it really boring. I guess it was just a lot of sport analytics. At least The Big Short has the glamour of finance. This was lacking that glamour, as I didn't find anything fascinating about baseball.I rewatched it recently and really enjoyed it. I thought it was a well made movie, might be the best Pitt movie out there, though not close to being my personal favorite. I don't think there were any great points being made however, whether political or economical. It was just about a guy making the best baseball team with underdogs of the system. Didn't really hold any deeper meaning than that, nor was this some fantastic cinematic experience. I could see how it's an Oscar contender, but I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't too.Pitt's good in the film. He showcases his acting skills, and he does it well. Whether he is good at acting up against other great actors remains in question. And whether he could really hit the emotional highs and lows as well. For what the movie is, he's watchable.

For the last hour, I wanted to know the outcome, but I also wanted to put the film on 2X speed, because there was simply no tempo.

Way overrated,"This film is about the general manager of a baseball team, who tries an unconventional statistical formula to pick his team.In contrast to Clint Eastwood's ""Invictus"", where they showed a football game for 30 minutes and make it a poignant emotional high, ""Moneyball"" does not achieve this same level of emotion at all. There is in fact no emotional zenith in ""Moneyball"". There are no motivational speeches, no players striving for excellence and no sign of ecstasy even when winning a record breaking streak. Instead, we only get to see Billy Beane looking lost and miserable the whole time. There is a serious lack of tension and engagement. ""Moneyball"" is way overrated in my opinion.",,Anonymous,Biography

Perhaps its not about the movie interesting subject but it's a well made movie.,"This is a sports movie without sport really. It's more a movie that shows you what is going on behind the scenes, instead of on the field. And luckily the movie is getting told in a good and interesting way, though the subject itself still wasn't all that interesting to me.It's a movie with lots of talking back and forth between different characters, mostly about numbers and statistics. And it's all good to watch, just not all that interesting or involving to follow. Seriously, I couldn't ever really feel involved with any of the characters and quite frankly I also couldn't have cared less about the Oakland A's winning or loosing their games.Then why am I still being mostly positive toward this movie in its rating, you might wonder. Well, simply because technically this is a really well made movie. There is no denying it that the movie has a good directing approach to it, which keeps the movie going at all times and prevents it from ever starting to drag or become a boring one to watch. Which is quite an accomplishment really, considering the movie its main premise. It's a bit of a shame director Bennett Miller has only directed 2 movies as of yet, since I definitely want to see far more done by him.I believe you also really could say that the story has such a good pace to it, thanks to the way it's written. It has good dialog in it and the movie doesn't ever dwell or goes for any cheap and false sentiments, or other Hollywood like developments with its story and drama. It's a movie with a real realistic and human approach to it, which is of course also due to the fact that it's based on a true story and true living persons.And it's also really being an actor's movie. I really wish Brad Pitt would play in more movies like this and more characters like this as well. He's simply really a great actor and he doesn't need his looks to get a leading and carrying role, in a heavy or serious movie. Jonah Hill was also good, in a rare non-comedic role by him. Both actors even received an Oscar nomination for their work in this movie.So while it's not being the most interesting movie to watch, it still manages to be a great watch nevertheless.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Aaron Sorkin's home run,Aaron Sorkin returns after writing The Social Network to pen this great film that allows Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill to give great performances that were well deserving of their award nominations.In the same way that Sorkin was able to write a film that could still be interesting to people who do not have or like Facebook here he takes the concept of Baseball but chooses instead to make the film not about the sport and more about the relationships between the people who are involved in it.Pitt gives a leading performance and the sharp writing of Sorkin allows this to come through. Hill has appeared in a wide range of films but in Moneyball really shows how good of an actor he can be.Overall this is a film for people who both love baseball and for people who have no understanding of it at all.

Another Brad Pitt eating movie..,"I'm starting to think Mr.Pitt doesn't know what to do with his hands when he's acting. But now he is rarely seen far from finger food. Initially I thought it was a character trait he'd invented for whoever he played in the Ocean's 11 series[ whenever we cut to him he usually was finishing some snack or other...hilarious!] But it seems that it's going to be a regular part of his performance cannon.He indulges in so many snacks, he actually mistimes one and while on the phone sorting out one dull transfer or another, he puts peanuts in his mouth just before he has to speak and then he spits them out.[ Honestly watch it again, it's no planned move] I'm baffled by this long uninteresting story, and why someone as good as Mr.Sorkin got involved. In a nutshell big league failure Billy Beane [ ""Dammit ! We've only got $39 million to spend !!...yeah, that must be tough""] uses Peter Brands system and fails to win the big prize...Why is the film about Billy ? Surely it's Pete's story , he's the underdog who came from nowhere to majors and changed how some teams used players. Billy was losing until he came along.Oh, and that 20 wins in a row ? This film is based around the use of statistics. And statistic's prove that if you do something long enough eventually all permutations will occur. That's why the record had stood so longit was simply time, not talent.Also Philip Seymour Hoffman, always brilliant, is left on the bench for most of the picture.

A Good Baseball Story,"I've always been partial to a good baseball movie and this one certainly fits that category. Essentially, this story is about a small-market team (the Oakland Athletics) that cannot compete with teams like the New York Yankees who are willing to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on the best players around. Recognizing this, the general manager, ""Billy Beane"" (Brad Pitt) hires an unknown adviser named ""Peter Brand"" (Jonah Hill) from the Cleveland Indians who specializes on finding undervalued talent. Against severe criticism from his scouts and coaching staff, they deliberately bypass well known players in search of inexpensive athletes who have been largely overlooked in the process. At any rate, rather than give the story away, I will just say that this film does a fine job in showcasing the risk that Billy Beane took to stay competitive. I also thought both Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill did excellent jobs in their respective roles as well. However, I would have liked to have seen more baseball and less of the personal drama in Billy Beane's life as it took away from the overall feel of the movie. But in any case, this was a good movie that should appeal to those who like a good baseball story.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Deserves The Praise!,"Moneyball is definitely worth all the praise it has been receiving. This is not a baseball film per se but more of a drama that centrals around the Oakland Athletic's General Manager, Billy Beane. This film features great acting, solid direction by Bennett Miller, a well-written screenplay, and a new take on the baseball films which have been done so many times before. Of course there are baseball scenes, but for once we get a look at the realistic portrayal of what happens behind the scenes.This film, based off the autobiography by Billy Beane himself, is about his 2002 season. After three superstars leave his team to get more money elsewhere, he designs a way to get players based off stats. With everyone calling him crazy including the A's manager, will this stat plan be effective? Brad Pitt is a very good, versatile actor. He certainly displays acting chops and I believed he should have won Best Actor at the Oscars. Jonah Hill takes a turn for the dramatic and perhaps has the best performance of his young career. And of course, Philip Seymour Hoffman is great as always.Overall, Moneyball has to be one of the greatest baseball films I have seen thanks to the way they filmed it. If they are to make sports films in the future, this is how to do it. It takes away all those clichés we see over and over again. It's good that this film was recognized by the Academy.

"""  It's  a game, that's plays for money, not the love of the sport, that only counts if you're a youngster ""","In the late 19th century, a baseball team was introduced to a up-and-coming young America as pastoral fun and leisure entertainment. However, someone from a rival town took to betting on that unimportant, non-descriptive game and promised to return with a better-team. That created a rivalry and up sprang a dozen teams all believing their's was the best. Fast forward to the present and anyone with a T.V. can see a baseball game being plays with a variety of teams, players and managers earning vast sums of money. Records and statistics are kept, revamped and stored, none of which can add one ray of sunshine to the original pastoral intent. This movie staring Brad Pitt is called "" Moneyball. "" It tells the story of Billy Beane (brad Pitt) who is a General Manager told by the owner that he is charged to create a winning baseball team with the funds already allocated to him. Despite his pleas for additional monies, none are forthcoming. Forced to accept that, he decides to hire Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) a statical researcher who believes the best way to win is to select players based on accumulated untapped statistics. Upon assembling said team, they are primed to win games, but are prevented by Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman) an old style coach who does not believe it's the way to run a team. Thus, it's a test of wills and therein lies the heart of this movie. In addition to his on the field problems is Beane's personal life and his growing teenage daughter. The film is a reminder of what's important, the game or the money? For the audience, it's a reminder of what becomes important to a man, his family or what he does to it?

Billy is tasked with rebuilding despite a payroll that leaves the A's trailing the competition.While going through the usual motions, Billy happens by Pete Brand (Jonah Hill), an economist who may have found a way to scout baseball with the efficiency the A's need. The two delve in head first, and despite some tough outings they never back down.Pitt is at the top of his game. As an everyman—or at least one that isn't played up as wealthy, a man struggling to keep his job—frustration is clearly seen in Pitt's face. Pitt brings humanity to the ominous job of a general manager. Flashbacks of his stint in ""the show"" surmise his entire life, be it his divorce or relationship with his daughter Casey (Kerris Dorsey).Moneyball is not the action-packed sports outing one may be expecting. Director Bennett Miller spends very little time focusing on the game of baseball, or even the personalities of the players. Moneyball is a movie about management. Its deadpan, forthright approach is fresh compared to the typical underdog story filled with home runs and stolen bases. There's no electrifying music or thrilling speeches, but the excitement found in a phone call is realized as well as one could imagine. I don't think any actor other than Hill could pull of his slowly clinched fist.Like the good sports films, Moneyball shares a deeper meaning than simply winning. Immediately the value of loyalty comes to mind. The sports genre is changing, much like how the crew of this story changed talent scouting. Just last year a movie rose up about the struggle to manage a boxer, and now here's the struggle to manage a team.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

changing the game,"I'm not a baseball fan, but ""Moneyball"" from 2011 held my interest all the way through. In part, this was because of the acting, and in part, because the story is so intriguing.Brad Pitt is General Manager of the Oakland A's, and he's fighting some bad odds. He can't compete for the best players because the A's are financially constrained. He loses three stars to free agency after losing to the Yankees in the 2001 playoffs.Unable to squeeze more money out of the owner, Beane is then approached by Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), an economics graduate from Yale. Hill believes people have been thinking about the game all wrong. It's not about stars, it's about statistics. Beane goes along with this and puts together a team that looks like a real loser, full of has-beens and players no one is interested in. But they get on base and score runs.Beane's manager, Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman) thinks the whole idea is awful and refuses to use the players as intended. So they keep losing.Excellent look at how thinking about things differently can give great benefits. This statistical approach has changed the game as other teams have picked up this method. It's not about the stars, the people who look good whom everybody wants. And no one knows that better than Beane, a baseball prodigy who gave up college and was picked up by a team as its new star and then choked, never living up to his potential.An outstanding film, with Pitt giving a wonderful, understated performance. Pitt is an actor who, like many from Hollywood's golden Age, suffers from too-good looks and too much publicity about his private life. He's a solid actor who works internally and gives natural performances. Billy Beane is a perfect role for him, a man who, despite internal fears and doubts, stands up for what he believes in.Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
New Age Heroism,"This sports drama represents the peak of the American indie cinema movement of the early 21st century led by Newline Cinema but not without affecting the rhythm and tone of the film. It portrays a sociopath baseball coach (Pitt) with bigger dreams than his university skills can allow. And so he spends most of his time lobbying for a sponsorship for a pathetic team of boys and for some salvation along the way in a moneyballed league. The film then circles around to focus not on the rules of the game but more on the human side to life. It grows out of its immature shell exactly as the director wants and to the approval of the audience into serious and compelling cinema.The film balances itself solely on the experienced shoulders of Brad Pitt. A word must be said about how impactful the acting is as he emotes his way through the crisis that he does not deserve. Moneyball is a tearful script but still a badly made film. It has ordinary lines and the scenes drag themselves with no special effort from the director and his team and it seems as if Pitt should be encouraging them instead of the players. Sadly in this case, it is just not uplifting enough.A poignant thought arises about the two important dimensions of any game, the unbroken will of an individual and the sacrifices that are made by members of a team. Moneyball hints at these qualities as it seeks to elucidate the tenets of human adventurism. The theme of the film unaltered, it falls into the list of the stoic Clint Eastwood hero but very much for the new age in this case.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Exceptional film.,"Moneyball was an exceptional movie and one of the best sports movies in recent years. Brad Pitt's supreme acting ability carries this film but the plot is also very interesting. Being a sports fan, I was familiar with most of the content in the film but what was most interesting, to me at least, was seeing how wrong so many ""experts"" were and how people refuse to learn from their prior mistakes. Look across the professional sports world and you still see people making the same mistakes that Billy Beane fought against a little over a decade ago. Nonetheless, the movie, though long, was not boring at all and I think most people would enjoy watching it, even those who are not baseball fans. Ultimately I think that's something unique about this film. Yes, it is a sports movie but it isn't necessarily about the sport of baseball but rather one person's fight against the prehistoric culture of baseball. That journey, and how well Bennett Miller directed the movie, is what is truly worth watching. RIP fat Jonah Hill... you will be missed.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Only fair in my book...,"While I thought the movie was well made, I just didn't enjoy it as much as I would have if it had been more ""fun."" I found it a bit slow at times and then when going through the statistical models in the trade, it went too fast... purposeful choppiness that some find entertaining, but I don't (kind of like the ""shaky camera"" or average shot times of less than five seconds effects. Some folks like them, I do not).Also, Brad Pitt's constant under-bite and messy eating (which seem to have become his attempt at a trademark look) I find annoying and now a distraction. And why Jonah Hill's character isn't given nearly the credit he got in real life as AGM I think is a big miss for this movie.Overall, I was disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

How can you not be romantic about baseball?,"Moneyball is based on a real story of a manager, also a former professional baseball player, Billy Breane(Brad Pitt) and the journey of his team, Oakland A's, in the season of 2002. The movie depicts the circumstances under which the teams makes a transition from being underdogs to becoming all-American record holders, a success attributed, at least as portrayed in this movie or the book on which it is based or often by the general public, to Billy's unorthodox and unusual methods of putting price on players based on numbers and statistics.Although the movie is based on baseball, it doesn't often depict out-of-the- park home runs, sacrifices, stolen bases nor any such adrenaline fueled scenes. Rather, the movie proceeds in a silent ambiance taking its audience much closer and intimate to the dialogues. The movie centers around Billy, making the role of Brad Pitt crucial in judging the quality of the movie, which, I feel, is indeed very fine, because, to mention a few, of his facial expressions and lines which perfectly fit to the situations. Jonah Hill takes a non-comedian role, which is kind of rare yet done greatly, of a statistician, Peter Brand, assisting in Billy's managerial decision matters. Besides, the movie also presents several philosophical insights to its audience through a life journey of a manager, and the frustrations, complications, and joyous moments involved with the job, which are never better said than watched.For the audience loving baseball, the movie may not reach the expectations, as it focuses not much on the game, rather more on the team's managerial issues. Consequently, the audience interested in management may find the movie quite interesting. The same applies to those audience who come from a background of statistics or IT, who would like the role played by Hill. In my personal opinion, I would describe the movie, although I'm not a big fan of baseball, yet in the very lines of the movie as, ""How can you not be romantic about baseball?""- it's a metaphor.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Brilliant movie about why we love baseball,"Brad Pitt brings the best of his acting talent to this biopic drama about what everyone loves about baseball. Based on the true events as well as the non- fiction novel by Michael Lewis, director Bennett Miller and writer acclaimed writer Aaron Sorkin takes a stab a story of the complexities of the Major League Baseball association, and the odds that defied expectation during these events. Pitt plays Billy Beane, manager of the Oakland Athletes disillusioned by the loss of the New York Yankees in the 2001 postseason. With the help of Peter Brand (played by Jonah Hill), an economics graduated from Yale, Beane recruits a team of undervalued players while coping with a tight budget. Rather than scouting, his method of recruitment involve choosing players based on home run scores and ability on base. Their unusual method of recruitment takes a challenge on the old-school traditions of baseball Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays Art Howe, Beane's manager who looks at his recruiting with disapproval.Many may have seen classic baseball flicks such Field of Dream (1989), A League of Their Own (1992), and The Sandlot (1993), but none of these come near as fascinating to this one. Brad Pitt demonstrates a top notch performance as Billy Beane, he definite kind of performance that demands for your attention. Looking back at the previous roles in his career, it is easy for some to cite this one as the best performance of his career. Then you have Jonah Hill, who is known for mostly comedic roles, takes on his first dramatic role and his performance is nothing short of magnificent. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is also given a share of spotlight, but not enough to make this a memorable role of him. This film is also beautifully written, the script is pretty sharp. Though it doesn't quite pack the punch that writer Aaron Sorkin conveyed in his previous, 'Social Network' for an example; there is plenty of heart and flair to be experienced. It tackles on some major issues dealing with baseball and it does with wit and intelligence. Unlike most baseball movies, this one doesn't directly focus on a team trying to make it the top of the scoreboard, and instead revolves around the business activity behind the park. Avoiding all the sports movie clichés, the plot follows how Billy Beane uses an unusual fashion for recruiting players, and it goes deeply how it affects the system. It teaches the audience the behind-the-scenes story of baseball that many may have never knew, and it does such an amazing job with it. It also demonstrates a clear image of what baseball is about and what goes on behind the stage. Yes, it has some funny moments, it has its dramatic moments, and there are other scenes that will have you lifted.Moneyball is one of 2011's best movies. This film is just so pleasing and so intriguing to watch. This would be very pleasing to baseball fanatics, as well viewers who enjoy the charismatic nature of Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill. Even if you are not much of a baseball fan, this one is definitely worth watching.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
On the Money,"Here's an enjoyable sports film with history behind it and heart inside it. The facts: Under the general management of Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) the Oakland A's achieved a phenomenal 20 game winning streak in the early part of this century. The cost: less than two thirds the expenditure of the Yankees. The real cost: players let go and Bean ridiculed, until his winning streak, which changed baseball forever.Moneyball's heart is in Brad Pitt's gentle performance, the best of his career depicting Beane's cool assurance relying on the statistics that have always been available, rather than the guesses of his scouts. A major part of the success is the data-mining mind of Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), a 25 year old Yale economics grad with a statistical approach that predicts the strength of players who have been marginalized or let go by other clubs. Sabermetrics is his creation, a strategy that builds on player strengths ignored by supposed experts.Unlike most other sports films, even the storied Any Given Sunday, Moneyball delivers organically, just a slow series of setbacks that are nonetheless essential to eventual success. Although we know the outcome, director Bennett Miller strategically paces the early struggles to make you care about the characters, even the negatively traditional coach Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Where some other films may surpass Moneyball is their showing the reasons on the field for the team's success, whereas here only some locker room chat and brief counseling can be seen as contributory.Like other sports films as well, the middle sags like Art's belly until the winning streak naturally enlivens the somber mood during the losses. Yet the film is exemplary in its feisty meetings as scouts square off against general manager Beane, who is slowly challenging their philosophies of status quo and intuition.On that note is the real strength of a film that exalts both creative thinking and mathematical accounting. Yet never is any of this change made easy",,Anonymous,Biography
The Game of Numbers,"Moneyball came out of left field for me (har, har) and surprisingly became one of my favorite films for 2011. I say surprisingly because I've never been a fan of sport films in general, and in particular I know very little about baseball, living as I do in a country where it's much less popular than sports like soccer, basketball, tennis etc. However Moneyball proved easily to be more than a mere sport film or a baseball movie. Though it has a lot of elements familiar from the 'underdog team wins against all odds' school of sport movie, that's not the center of the story.Unlike Bennett Miller's previous movie, Capote, which relied on one very strong performance to cover for a weak script, here Aaron Sorkin's wit is easy to spot in the excellent screenplay, and though Brad Pitt does deliver a solid performance - one of his most subtle and understated - he doesn't steal the show. He does overshadow the rest of the cast, including Jonah Hill who makes an impressive foray into serious drama which, unfortunately, falls to clichés as the film goes on, and the wonderful Philip Seymour Hoffman whose performance is good but almost too understated to work.Moneyball is an effective movie, skillfully directed and very well paced, that manages to stay interesting throughout its over-two-hours run. It gets extra points for being communicative enough to allow a non-baseball fan to enjoy it and understand what's going on, though it loses some for not quite succeeding in showing just how important Beane's contribution to the sport was. Definitely worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Required Viewing for Any A's Fan,"At one time I was a deep believer in Billy Beane. At the release of this movie in 2011 I was team Beane. To me and a lot of A's fans he could do no wrong. Then, on July 31, 2014, his system and probably his ego got in the way. Beane traded Yoenis Cespedes to the Red Sox for Jonny Gomes and Jon ""I don't throw to first to check runners"" Lester. The A's fan base was devastated to say the least. Yoenis was a five tool player, an all-star, and a fan favorite.Two camps formed right after that trade: the ""Beane can do no wrong"" camp--which had always existed and we all belonged to before--and the ""Beane has lost his mind"" camp. I was in a smaller sub-camp of ""Let's see how this turns out.""When the A's lost to the Kansas City Royals that year in the newly minted play-in game I was livid and I found myself firmly in the Beane has lost his mind camp, and I've been there ever since.""Moneyball"" harks me back to a simpler and happier time. Brad Pitt probably made Beane cooler and more charismatic than he ever was. The movie chronicles the 2002 season in which Beane embraced a more analytical, math-based approach to the game that had never been tried before. He hired Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), a Yale graduate who majored in economics, to be his assistant GM. Peter's methodology was to look at less sexier player statistics like on-base-percentage and walks in order to evaluate players. He famously valued Scott Hatteberg (Chris Pratt), an injured catcher released by Boston, as a good buy because he walked a lot.The movie gave me goosebumps as it covered the 2002 season, especially the 20 game win streak. There's actual audio and video footage used where we can hear the voice of the late Bill King. It's enough to bring any A's fan to tears.So, is my rating of this movie biased? Absolutely. I love this movie for how it made me feel. I love baseball, I love the A's, and I used to love Billy Beane. ""Moneyball"" had all three at a point in time when I loved all three.

Just another film about a sport nobody outside America cares about.,"I read from a reviewer that you didn't have to know anything about baseball to enjoy Moneyball and that it was a worthy Oscar nominated movie. He was wrong on both counts. Having nearly seen nearly all this years best picture nominated films i have to say , that apart from Tree of Life , it's been a very average year and Moneyball sums up what i mean.This is the story of Billy Beane , The General manager of The Oakland Athletics an American baseball team . Beane realises he cannot compete with the big boys financially so along with Peter Brand a statistics and finance wizard , he builds a record winning team out of journeyman Baseball players.I know nothing about Baseball and because of this i didn't have a clue what was happening when they were discussing the sport. Sure , i understand the fundamentals of the story but it's nowhere near enough to get me interested. Brad Pitt is good as is Jonah Hill but at the end of the day it's bloody a Baseball movie Zzzzzzzzzz.Moneyball is yet another self obsessed movie about an American sport that the rest of the world cares nothing about and how this gets nominated for an Oscar is beyond me.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
I was just kinda bored,"Sometimes you hear about a movie and you say, well, that doesn't sound at all interesting, but so many people say it's great that you watch it anyways. That's what happened in the case of Moneyball, a movie that combines two things I have little interest in: sports and statistics.Unfortunately, while my instincts aren't always right, in this case they were dead on. While there are interesting moments in the movie, like Billy Beane doing some fancy horse trading, I just never connected with this movie. Brad Pitt was rather bland and even though the script was co-written by Aaron Sorkin, I found the dialog flat. The story is interesting, but it seems to move so slowly; I think I would have been better off reading the book.Sometimes a movie can be riveting even though its subject matter is unappealing, but this isn't one of those movies. If you love baseball and statistics then this movie may be great, but I could have done without it.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Accessible For Those Who Know Nothing Of Baseball - Intriguing And Enjoyable,"This true story of the men who bought science to bear on that most inherently romantic of American addictions, baseball, still finds space for plenty of romance. Brad Pitt never feels quite cynical and grizzled enough, but Jonah Hill is outstanding as the man with the mathematical brain behind it all. Like most things involving Aaron Sorkin, women are underwritten to the point of near-invisibility, only ever doing what's necessary to allow their talented men to shine. But for a Sorkin film, it's also uncharacteristically laid-back in the amount and pace of dialogue, which works well for a film about a sport that trades on the marathon rather than the sprint. More than accessible for those who know nothing of the sport, it has much to say about how we approach any of life's endeavours - but never quite gives the characters a rounded-enough life to really push through to essential territory.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Always feels fresh and alive,"The first baseball game I ever saw was in Yankee Stadium when I was ten years old. At that time, the Yankees had players now considered baseball immortals: Phil Rizzuto, Joe Dimaggio, Tommy Henrich, Charlie Keller, and others. The Yankees closer was Joe Page who, when summoned into a game, always climbed over the bullpen gate like a little boy, awestruck with wonder. All were products of the traditional scouting system, operating without the benefit of knowing a player's slugging percentage, on-base percentage, or a pitcher's WAR (wins above replacement). Scouts had to recommend players based on past performance, personal observation, and something intangible - their best sense of who would and who would not make it in the major leagues. . Those days are past, however, and today every team uses a computerized analysis of a player's value called ""sabermetrics,"" which is supposed to provide information such as how often a player will get on base. This new approach is dramatized in Bennett Miller's Moneyball, an entertaining and often moving film that may be an early contender for an Oscar Best Picture nomination. Adapted by Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin from the book ""Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game"" by Michael Lewis, the film stars the charismatic Brad Pitt as Billy Beane, a former player who became the General Manager of the Oakland Athletics in 1998, and who changed the game forever.Using authentic recreations as well as archival footage, Moneyball opens in 2002, one year after the Oakland Athletics were eliminated from the playoffs by the New York Yankees. As GM, Beane has the daunting task of replacing three of his key players, including Johnny Damon and Jason Giambi, who signed with Boston and New York. In flashbacks, we learn that the young Billy Beane (Reed Thompson) was heralded by scouts as a ""five-tool"" player who signed him out of high school in 1979, convincing him to give up a full scholarship to Stanford to play for the New York Mets. The scouts guessed wrong on this one and, after a brief and unsuccessful career as a player, he turned to scouting and then management.Perhaps bitter about his history with scouts, he now chides his scouting staff for their efforts to find bargain replacements for his departed stars, and makes a plea to ownership for more money. Things take a sharp turn, however, when Beane has a chance meeting with Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), an Economics graduate from Yale University, who is working for the Cleveland Indians. Brand is a disciple of Bill James, the man who developed sabermetrics and who had come to believe that a player's ability to get on base (on-base percentage) through a combination of hits and walks was more important to the team than just his batting average.After Brand tells Beane that there's ""an epidemic failure to understand what is really happening"" in the game, Beane snatches him away from the Indians and appoints him as his personal assistant. Together, they use statistical analysis to seek out players whose value to other teams may have diminished, and who are now available at a lower price. Beane immediately receives strong opposition from his manager, Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a veteran who is also upset about his one-year contract, and some flack from his chief scout Grady Fuson (Ken Medlock), who feels threatened by the new approach and considers it detrimental to baseball.Beane is depicted in the film as being volatile and aloof, unwilling to travel with the team for fear of becoming too close to the players. In spite of his cold exterior, however, the scenes with his ex-wife (Robin Wright), and his musically-talented teenage daughter (Kerris Dorsey) show him to be a warm and caring person. The game of baseball is his passion and, even when his team goes on a record breaking winning streak in 2002, he maintains that nothing matters to him except winning the final game and that his real goal is to change the way teams are constructed.Supported by outstanding performances, especially those of Pitt and Hill, Moneyball stays away from sports clichés and always feels fresh and alive. Today, nine years after 2002, the year in which the film is set, sabermetrics has become an accepted part of the game. Unfortunately, however, in the same way that the quality of a film has become less important to the studios than its appeal to target audiences, baseball teams may have become too reliant on statistical analysis. While it can never completely reinvent the game, it extends its reach today, not only in the recruitment of players, but also in day-to-day decision-making where ""playing the percentages"" often trumps common sense.Though statistics are useful as a tool, baseball will never be a science. It is a game of measureless intangibles, of emotion and desire, of late inning heroics and dramatic comebacks. Unscripted and unpredictable, it is a game of grace and skill, ""a ballet without music, a drama without words."" To a ten-year-old, ""the stuff as dreams are made on."" The poet Wordsworth asked, ""Where is it now, the glory and the dream?"" It is still there and will always be, but, perhaps like contemporary society, the scientist and the artist are struggling for its soul.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Games People Play,"This film is recommended.I have never been a baseball fan. The game bores me completely and I always found it to be a money-grubbing sport, even though it's still considered America's favorite past-time. The 1994 -95 Major League Baseball strike put the final kibosh on the sport for me. So I went to see the critically lauded sports film Moneyball with some bias and trepidation. Though it did not reinforce my love of the game, it did prove my initial response to be wholly accurate. And the film scores big-time, even though the subject matter still bored me sporadically.They say money can't buy you happiness, but it sure as hell can buy you a winning team. Or so Billy Beane ( Brad Pitt ), manager of one of the lowest paying team, the Oakland Athletics, believes, as he finds himself battling the odds with his players against those damn Yankees and other pro teams.Billy builds a strong winning team only to have his best players hired out from under him. Enter the nerd, Peter Brand ( Jonah Hill ), baseball statistician and Yale graduate, with a plan for the Oakland A's and Billy to succeed. But it's the team manager, a gruff and unbelieving Art Howe ( Phillip Seymour Hoffman ) that doesn't hold kindly to the Ivy Leaguer and his aggravating boss interfering in the Major League business of baseball championships.The dry subject of statistical analysis of baseball players and their point averages may weigh heavily with your enjoyment of this film, but Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin take this nominal and unexciting premise and run with it with their literate and expertly written screenplay. Although they may not totally succeed in their exposition and narrative clarity of the numerical plan that Beane and Brand hatch, they wisely give much screen time to Billy and his witty banter with Peter, plus show his paternal side with his loving daughter ( a charismatic Kerris Dorsey ) to full effect.Director Bennett Miller's use of baseball montages and statical numbers as graphic images delivers a nice visual look to the film. The director also assembles a crackerjack A-team of players. Leading the cast is Brad Pitt who adds to his impressive resume with another heartfelt performance. Ecstatically and statistically speaking, this actor's average as a major talent grows with every film he chooses lately. Hill has never been more appealing as his nebbish of a business partner. Especially strong is Hoffman as Billy's doubting nemesis. More screen time and further scenes of conflict with this fine actor and Pitt would have only enhanced this fine film even more.Moneyball triumphs with its behind the scenes look at baseball and its quick-witted dialog and vivid characters. As previously mentioned, I still don't have a love of the game, nor did I love this film, but I did love the masterful performance of Brad Pitt and his fellow acting pros.

If only I was American,"After I watched the film, I realised that Moneyball did not appeal to me, and I doubt it will appeal to other British audiences either. The screenwriters here have written a witty and very intelligent script for the film, adapting it from the general manager's book of the same name. And much of the dialogue requires a baseball head to understand. I do not have one and don't suspect many British people to have one either.Those who are exceptions of this will be in for a delight. My personal response may have been that I found it to be difficult to be gripped by the subject matter but the American audience, the ones that are obviously the target demographic, will be in for this year's The Social Network. Two reasons why: number one – one of the screenwriters of Moneyball is Aaron Sorkin, who wrote The Social Network and has written something of similar quality here, and number two – director Bennett Miller has managed to take a simple subject matter and undeniably transform it into something far more interesting. This is a sports film that is not cliché-ridden. There's no sudden conflict that is a turning point in the narrative. In fact, there's a lack of equilibrium, just showing how chaotic and troubled Billy Beane is at this point in his career. And in fact, this isn't as much of a film about the sport as it is about the business of it all. Moneyball is a very talkative picture (which is why I don't recommend it to tweens or the frat house, because this is more artistic than entertaining) yet it manages to be somewhat intriguing when watching Billy Beane managed the Oakland A's just as they were hitting the lowest of lows.The main reason for this was the Billy Beane played by Brad Pitt, who now looks to be a real contender for an Oscar nomination. This is a different role for Brad Pitt, he's taking authority – yes, he played a leader in Inglorious Basterds but this is better acting displayed by him. As well as delivering lines pitch perfectly (it's expected of any actor playing a 'formal' figure to act realistically when speaking), he brings a lot of humanity in the role, the key scenes being the ones where he is the only character in the frame and his facial expressions speak for him. The opening and closing shots, especially, of him are effective.Jonah Hill, as Peter Brand, the Yale graduate with a major in Economics who assists Beane, turns-in terrifically as long as the expectations on him aren't for him to be the funnyman of the film. He is showing he has a broad range in this role, taking on a serious role as comic actors have done before him and done very well – Jim Carrey in Eternal Sunshine, Adam Sandler in Punch-Drunk Love, etc.All in all, the direction is superb. The acting is excellent. The writing is sharp. The editing is splendid, especially in the baseball match scenes where the film cleverly combines real time with archive footage. Moneyball is undeniably an incredible piece of filmmaking and smarter than most Hollywood films this year. Yet it can only be enjoyed thoroughly if you know about baseball. And alas, I'm British and don't know much more about baseball than the team names. I'd perfectly understand it if a similar film was released where the subject matter was football, and I saw an American reviewer writing about the same problem he had when listening to actors speak about ""the banter bus"" and the team's best ""holding midfielder"", like we heard of ""ugly girlfriend"" or a ""switch hitter"".",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

While according to IMDb he didn't write it alone (I guess he was the last to ""temper"" with the script), I'm pretty sure he had his hands on most of the dialogue in the movie. Really great stuff. And whoever thought Jonah Hill can't do anything ... well watch this movie and start believing.Of course the bigger name is Brad Pitt and he shows his love for the game by really sticking to this concept and getting it made in the first place (the four credited writers here are an indication that it took some time to get it off ground). Even a side-/sub-story that get thrown in halfway through the movie does not really temper with the mood or distract you too much (which was something I was afraid of, when Robin Wright came into the ""play"").Don't watch it though if you wanna see the game itself. There is not much of that happening. But the movie does not need any of the sports scenes to work. It works perfect as it is ...",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

An absolutely amazing movie that non baseball fans will love.  Pitt and Hill have great chemistry.  A must watch. I say A.,"""If we win with this team we will have changed the game for good."" After losing to the Yankees in the 2001 playoffs the Oakland A's begin to get picked apart. After three of their best players leave from free agency it is up to GM Billy Bean (Pitt) to field a competitive team. After meeting Peter Brand (Hill) he sees a new way to field a team. Using modern technology and math instead of scouting to rate players he signs of team of ""nobodys"". Being a huge baseball fan I was very much looking forward to this movie, this movie was even better then I was hoping for. Written by the writers of ""Social Network"" it has roughly the same feel. Watching what a GM goes through on a day by day basis gave me new appreciation for what they do, and to watch Bean struggle with making a team with the lowest payroll in the league to try and compete with teams like the Yankees who have almost 100,000,000 dollars a year more is impressive. The only bad thing I have to say about this movie has nothing to do with the movie itself. Going in I knew enough history about what happened with this team and Beane himself that the tense moments and hard decisions lost some of the effect on me. But that in no way hurt my enjoyment of the movie, and for those that don't know as much about this it will have the effect it went for. On a side note Pitt and Hill have the same chemistry that Cloony and Pitt had in the ""Oceans 11"" movies and that makes it more fun to watch. Overall, one of the best movies about sports (not just baseball) I have ever seen. There is also enough in this that even if you are not a baseball fan you will still really enjoy this. I give it an A.Would I watch again? - Absolutely, I want to buy this.*Also try - Field Of Dreams & The Social Network",,Anonymous,Biography
The Vidiot Reviews...,"MoneyballThe sex/baseball analogy doesn't end with bases and home-runs.In fact, both activities also employ stats, performance-enhancing drugs and the capacity to bore women easily.Regrettably, this drama has nary a female to corroborate with that last comparison.When 3 of his star players jump ship, the general manager of the Oakland Athletics, Billy Beane (Brad Pitt), is left with a void to fill.Unable to attract any of the high paid players, Beane, instead, hires a young economist (Jonah Hill) to identify the sport's most undervalued players so that he can add them to his roster.While the unorthodox strategy attracts the ire of the A's manager (Philip Seymour Hoffman), all suspicions are quelled once the theory comes to fruition.Though it's a savvy deconstruction of baseball's financial divide, this true story can at times become tedious.Besides, blue-collar baseball fans will always prefer to drunkenly harassing rich athletes.

Numbers and tactics made beautiful,"After being defeated by the New York Yankees in the 2001 play-offs, losing three of his key players to bigger contracts at richer clubs, and then being refused more funds for new players by the club's owner, Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane (played by Brad Pitt) hires an inexperienced Yale economics graduate (Jonah Hill) and starts utilizing hard statistics (now known as sabermetrics) to recruit specialized talent who are seemingly over the hill or has another defect which have made them unattractive to other clubs. Will this novel and - to many - controversial approach pay off?In form and structure, Moneyball is a familiar underdog story which have been known to work ever so well many times before on the big-screen. However, this is no Rocky with lots of action and simple, emotional dialogue. And it's no Youngblood style of film in which the game itself is simplified to attract ""regular"" viewers. On the contrary, Moneyball is something as rare as a sports film about numbers and tactics. It's not only based on real-life people and events, but it also treats and presents these people and events accordingly, and not through a conventionalized archetype-filter. A film as technical and theory-oriented as this one may sound inaccessible to outsiders, but as a typical European soccer-fan with minimal knowledge about the game of baseball, I say on the contrary. This is a breath of fresh air in a world of movie-making which often underestimates its viewers. Moneyball is a detailed and fairly fast-paced account from an environment about which the filmmakers are never afraid to be specific and comprehensive. And this works as a perfect counterweight to the heart and moral of the story, which is undeniably simplistic, but also inherently beautiful.Brad Pitt gives arguably the best performance of his career as real-life GM Billy Beane. His performance has a drive and a carefreeness which I haven't seen in Pitt for years, and combined with appropriate mannerisms and a clearly deep understanding of the character, he gives the film the momentum it needs. Jonah Hill and Philip Seymour Hoffman complement him with fine supporting work in a film which puts Aaron Sorkin's edgy dialogue to the best use that it has been since A Few Good Men. And the fine directing job is credited to Bennett Miller (of Capote) and he conveys the script, which Sorkin co-wrote with Steve Zaillian, with a clear focus about what he wants to accomplish, handling the sentimental and the bittersweet with equal aptitude.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good movie about baseball and risk 7/10,"""Moneyball"" is a fascinating true story about baseball and taking chances. Lead actors Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill are in charge of the management of the Oakland Athletics baseball team in the 2002 season. The script was written by Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin who are among the best screenwriters in cinema, so this kind of collaboration is awesome. And the result is perfect. Ever wondered where does math have a place in baseball? Well this movie gives the answers. I loved all the close ups during the scenes, the moments of quiet tension on the field with the camera making close ups on the characters was a marvelous job, The cinematography in other words. The movie's message to me is an important key role cause the message has a motive throughout the film: it's all about taking big risks and decisions, Billy Beane (Pitt) takes multiple risks throughout the film and with every decision he makes he knows it could get him fired. Overall this is a great movie that is more than just baseball but has other surprises.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Baseball Movie That's Not About The Baseball,"26 September 2011. Surprisingly, this movie is less about the baseball game than the game of baseball. What is striking about this movie (and it's not about outs) is the raw audio sound technique used in this movie that is usually found in documentaries than feature films which helps make this movie come alive. There is a the ambiance of background sound and the echo that seems to resonate and bring the movie closer to the audience and present a much closer to realism experience. There isn't that much actual continuous footage of baseball in this movie, but rather the management of it. The heightened personal and emotional tension is carried throughout the movie and Director Bennett Miller has put together this compelling very intimate portrait of a man played by Brad Pitt and his statistician in an unusual angle of the game of baseball.Somehow the almost overly brief snippets of scenes and background of current events and story are blended together along with poignant flashbacks will edited into some meaningful, main storyline without ever creating the idea of that the additional footage has someone been shortchanged. Bennett Miller apparently in his wisdom was able to capture the primary message of the movie, developed an accompanying background, and maintained the singular story around the entire movie, the art of carefully scriptwriting and editing.Even without the formulaic all-American ending, Bennett Miller was able to wrap this movie into a complete feeling of wholeness for a feature film. Miller made excellent use of silence and editing choices in keeping the camera going just long enough for the more in-depth, substantive emotional impact of a scene to sink in. Miller seems to have brought a new found vision of a approach that brings a more connectiveness and meaningfulness to film-making, especially to interesting stories of reality that aren't even about the biggest and most momentous achievements of humanity and bringing them captivatingly to the big screen.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Moneyball,"i liked it, but wasn't taken away by it. the film certainly portrays an interesting, touching look on Baseball in a lot of times, and there's the crew and cast to thank for that. it is well shot, paced and overall well made to keep it entertaining, but the subject matter and the circumstances, for me, were not significant enough to earn the emotional impact that it skillfully goes for, and it's not very encouraging to see. the film also gets a bit stale around the details and the statistics of the game. the inclusion of Beane's family to expand on the main character, i thought was largely ineffective and poorly executed.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A cerebral approach to the subject of baseball,"It's a baseball management theory movie primarily set in 2002 and follows the Oakland Athletics baseball team's performance, focusing on the General Manager and his Assistant General Manager.Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) was a failed Major League Baseball player that we see in flashbacks. He's become the General Manager of the low-budget Oakland Athletics. In 2001 the team made the post-season, but now three of its best players are free agents going to teams who can pay them much more. Beane needs to construct a competitive team on a shoestring. He hires Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) as an Assistant GM. Brand has a Yale economics degree and a passion for sabermetrics (detailed baseball analysis). Beane and Brand go about constructing a team of apparent misfits because their statistical analysis indicates they should win. This innovative approach is opposed by the head scout, Grady Fuson (Ken Medlock), and other traditional scouts. The manager, Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman), also resists the new approach.The movie sees the Athletics' season play out, including roster moves made by Beane to force the manager to play the team he wants on the field. Much is made of a record-length winning streak that lands Oakland in first place late in the season, though they lose in the first round of the playoffs. But the clear lesson is that sabermetrics works.In some ways, this is a cerebral approach to the subject of baseball. Beane was an early advocate of the statistical analysis that rules the game in 2022. Unfortunately, the assumptions Beane and Brand had about the game--never bunt, never steal, work for walks--have been lost in the current-day discussion of exit velocities, defensive shifts, and rotation speeds of pitches. But the movie is an excellent introduction to a significant change in Major League Baseball.Brad Pitt makes Billy Beane seem sexy, Jonah Hill looks like a nerd, and Philip Seymour Hoffman is a superb resistant manager.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good Movie,"I thought this was a good movie...very plain however. It was all Brad Pitt here. The Jonah Hill praise was undeserved IMO. He was good, but not to the extent that he stole the film. It was Pitt's charisma that made this movie watchable. Without him, a very average and forgotten film. This is what star power does. His character's personality made the new system he was presenting believable.Most of the secondary characters were underdeveloped. His relationship with his daughter, though moving, needed more depth. I think was a very difficult film to storyboard and present...but it worked.Because the director blended a lot of actual film/video clips from the A's 2002 year, the movie had a strong documentary feel to it. I love doc films so no prob for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Good sports movies create a strong connection with their audience, but this movie fails to do that. Brad Pitt wasn't that great in the movie. Jonah Hill did a good job. However, when it boils down to it this is just another typical sports movie. Nothing special or amazing.

Secondly, the story tells about people who failed and got another chance, and about outsiders and under dogs coming in to challenge people who think they have all the answers.

Entertaining at times but mixed overall,"Based on a true story, this film is an account of the 2002 baseball season for the Oakland Athletics and its general manager, Billy Beane (portrayed by Brad Pitt). Beane uses unconventional methods to improve his team's troubles. The film also portrays his past as a baseball player and his current family life as a divorced parent.It takes a while to get into this film as the beginning is rather dull with meetings about baseball team strategies - not interesting for viewers who know little about the sport. It thankfully gets more interesting after the first fifteen minutes when the GM begins his unconventional approach to change things.There are times when this film falls into the cliché of other sports movies where manipulative background music is used to easily foreshadow what's coming next. Thankfully, the conclusion is more complex in the end even though it leaves one wondering what the moral point was to the movie if there was to be one.Entertaining at times but mixed overall. - dbamateurcritic",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A near perfect sports film,"Brad Pitt did an outstanding job of fulfilling the role of Billy Beane, as he was cocky and nonchalant but had hilarious outbreaks; every exchange with Jonah Hill was entertaining and effortless. For Jonah Hill, this was his first real test on whether or not he could take on a serious role, and he definitely delivered. He does a spectacular job on expressing his emotions and portraying an intellectual yet awkward baseball nerd. Another performance worth noticing was Phillip Seymour Hoffman, who took on the role of Art Howe and played a snobby, egocentric manager quite effectively.This movie is not for people who are into non stop sports action. It is for the true baseball fanatics, ones who are not willing to watch a sports movie with mostly replicated action, but a movie that takes a behind-the-scenes approach on America's pastime. Also, if a viewer finds interest in another sport and does not quite understand baseball, they can apply these same principles to their sport and find the same amount of enjoyment. It is not only catered to sports gurus, though. For viewers who are not interested in sports, I believe this movie can be a bit confusing with many usages of technical jargon. It is a decent introduction to the sports world, and maybe can spark a newfound enthusiasm and excitement for sports. Also, it is made to give credit to the people not seen in the spotlight, and shines light on the entirety of baseball and its complexity.The phenomenal acting performances, the amazing soundtrack, and the incredible cinematography all tie in to what should be referred to as the greatest sports movie of all time. The underlying themes and metaphors were inspirational and effective, and not aspects you usually see in a sports movie. With all of these characteristics put together in one movie, it makes for a masterpiece that I recommend to everyone.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Math and baseball together,"With the best players playing the right way, a team is assured a victory. But if the best players are too expensive, do you simply take who you can get and give in? Or have you been overlooking quality players simply because conventional wisdom said you should?Billy Beane (played by Brad Pitt) is General Manager of the Oakland A's and after losing the last game of the season against the Yankees, three of his star players leave for more lucrative contracts. He'd hoped to match their offers, but the owner couldn't afford it. Then, while looking for a trade at the Cleveland Indians' headquarters, he noticed his counterpart appeared to be taking direction from someone he'd never seen before. After the meeting he approaches Peter Brand (played by Jonah Hill), the one person he didn't know in that meeting who seemed to be calling the shots. Brand and Beane soon have a rapport and before long Brand is Beane's second-in-command despite serious resistance from the rest of the staff in the Manager's office who feel Brand is a threat to the team and the game itself.Sabermetrics has had wide-reaching and long-lasting effects on the game of baseball from supposedly ending the Red Sox losing streak to posthumously exonerating fabled great ""Shoeless"" Joe Jackson. The story is interesting and Jonah Hill acting way outside his comfort zone is, to say the least, adequate. Brad Pitt also plays his part well as he often does, regardless of the material. That said, at two hours and thirteen minutes, the film feels too long. I don't say that because I believe all movies should be shorter than this, but I do believe this one should've been shorter.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Moneyball  is a hit for sports fans,"A must see for any true baseball fans, Moneyball takes a look at more than just the Oakland Athletics. It beautifully mixes Oakland general manager Billy Beane's decision to shake up how he runs his team, with his personal life. Bennett Miller, the director, really causes the viewer to root for not only the A's team from ten years ago, but gives fans reason to root for Beane and the A's in today's season by the end of the film.The Oakland A's are coming off a season in which, although they made the playoffs, they suffered a disappointing loss to the New York Yankees. Unfortunately for Billy Beane, three of his biggest stars leave in free agency. Beane has to find a way to replace his best players, while still staying within the lowest salary cap confines in all of baseball. Beane turns to unconventional methods of replacing lost production.This is where Moneyball, in my opinion, excels. The way Bennett Miller portrays the old school vs. new school ways of thinking is very good. It portrays how many baseball scouts and front office men were stuck in the past where the eye test is all that matters. However Billy Beane and his new assistant Peter Brand, a Yale graduate with a degree in economics, turn to a radical new method of determining player values: saber-metrics, which is looking mainly at certain statistics to determine players value. Many of the old school scouts greatly resent this new method of determining player value and think that Beane is ignoring all of their hard work, especially when Beane sign a slew of unconventional players to help replace the loss of his three stars.The first half of the season does not go well for the Athletics, leading to critics to call Beane's new method of selecting players a failure. This is very frustrating for Beane as he has to win the support of the owners, while pouring every single minute of his life into his job. The problem is that Beane recently got divorced and shares time with his daughter. His increased work responsibilities make it harder for Beane to see his daughter.One of the neatest scenes, if you are a sports-nerd like myself, is the trade deadline scene. It is a very tense few minutes as Beane and Brand attempt to wheel-and-deal with other teams. Miller paints Beane as a powerful general manager to be feared by having him give other GM's deadlines and telling them they are giving up a huge opportunity.However the turning point of the film definitely is the streak. After struggling to compete in the first half of the season, the team rips off a 20 game win streak which is the longest in A.L. history. At this point in the film, there is a general consensus being reached that Beane's experiment with saber-metrics have worked as the A's are roaring towards the playoffs. Although they may lose to the twins in the post season, almost everyone around baseball generally agrees that saber-metrics is here to stay and is probably the future.The end of the film has Beane meeting with the owners of the Boston Red Sox, who offer him the largest contract for a general manager at the time. This is the hardest decision Beane has to make of the whole film. He could go to Boston and take the money and help remake that once great team into contenders again, or he could stay near his daughter, and finish what he started in Oakland. In the end, he ends up choosing to stay in Oakland, after listening to a CD of his daughter singing and thanking him for being a great Dad. After the film ends, the reader learns that Beane stays in Oakland to finish what he started and to win a World Series there. They also learn that the Red Sox have won two world series in the last decade using a strategy similar to that of Beane's. By including this information, the director causes the viewers to feel sympathy for Beane and makes the viewer hope that the Athletics can win a World Series with Beane at the helm.Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill perform very well in the roles of Billy Beane and Peter Brand respectively. This is a great film to see if you have a genuine interest in baseball or even sports.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Winning on the Cheap,"This is a fun movie provided you like sports and/or baseball – and a basic knowledge of baseball will add to the enjoyment. Its' more about the management and business side, than about the game – buts its' also about winning and how to win – in this case on a spartan budget. Baseball is more of a statistical game than others – there are numbers all over the place – innings, strikeouts, walks, hitting averages, on- base averagesSo it starts with general manager Billy Beane (played by Brad Pitt) getting a ""Google-boy"" (played by Jonah Hill) to give him masses of statistics on players from other teams with the all-important dollar value (current player salary) in one of the columns. Using the data from these spreadsheets, along with the significant dollar column, Billy Beane wheels and deals. A dream team is built on the cheap.It's all pleasurable and funny with tantrums, business meetings with old baseball codgers eyeing Google-boy most suspiciously, and the recruitment and abrupt dismissal of players. I felt Philip Seymour Hoffman under-used (but did he ever look like a baseball coach!!) There was even some syrupy stuff of Billy and his daughter which kind of worked – this was probably tossed in to distract away from the predominant male element in this film.For a 2 hour plus movie Moneyball plays well and entertains.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Brad Pitt confronts Justice and makes a statement, that ""New York"" is paying 1/2 his salary not to be there (it is made to seem that ""New York"" was the ""Yankees."")

"Brad Pitt does baseball, Jonah Hill does maths & Moneyball does depth.","Moneyball is about baseball and mathematics.I don't understand baseball; it seems to me to be a more complicated version of rounders but with a bigger bat, more rules and a globally renowned tournament called the World Series in which only America may enter.As for maths, well, Mr. Barnicot will tell you it and I were never great friends.The film is based on actual events, although I have no idea how much has been fictionalised.But none of this matters because, beyond all of the above, Moneyball is a film about vision, about passion, about making a stand, about losing and having another go with whatever limited resources are at your disposal. It's about relationships and being bloody-minded even when the vast majority thinks you're delusional and inept but having the confidence to know, not merely believe, that you are right.The film works because of the heavyweights putting their best work into it. Aaron Sorkin and Steven Zaillian have written a script that can be understood by even those who have never seen a baseball diamond. It's a screenplay that is brought to life with sincere and beautifully restrained performances by its stars, Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill, and supporting cast, notably Phillip Seymour Hoffman. In other hands, each of these characters may have been played more emphatically and with greater decibels but the performers never veer towards pantomime. Hill is particularly engaging with his restrained portrayal of a young man with an unproven theory in an environment where he is almost universally resented.Director Bennett Miller has delivered a film that may well slip under the radar due to sheer number of high-profile films on release at this time of year, but even if you wait for it on DVD, this is a film you shouldn't write off simply because of a lack of knowledge of sport.Let me start again. Moneyball is about a baseball team with no money to buy players, mutinous staff and a General Manager who brings in a kid with a degree from Yale and a notion that nobody but the GM wants to hear.

the base-balling 'Rocky' this is not.,"For what has been hailed such a great sports movie I'd have to object. Yes the film is good, but it is overly long, plays on Americanisms (baseball) and really does lack the subject to entertain thoroughly.Brad Pitt is very good in arguably this one dimensional role, as likable ex-player and now GM Billy Bean. He hires a statistician, computer geek (Jonah Hill) to help him rebuild the Oakland Athletics baseball team, on a tiny budget (to compete in Major League Baseball). Based on and telling a real story adds to it's impact, but the base-balling 'Rocky' this is not.The script and cast although tight, arguably fails to entertain and some of it's scenes are too basic, light and almost over-thought to create added effect or realism. It really strikes out for me in a few key areas, and it's US backed hype will soil opinion of it's following European counterparts.So, a good film lies beneath this very American based tale, if you can bare the 2 hours and watery content which tells the tale of a sporting underdog.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

With a budget of $40 million, Billy and Peter used their knowledge of these new statistics and limited budget to find undervalued players.

A script by the pros,"I love this movie. I've seen it half a dozen times. And I'm not even a baseball fan. The genius of Moneyball is with writers Zallian and Sorkin. You 'd swear you were watching a documentary, it's so good.Bradford: ""And sir, I just want to let you know I'm gonna be praying for you and your family.""Billy: ""No problem.""Not only do they nail the structure of the underdog sports movie in a way that's fresh - almost like you've never seen it before - the dialog is full of these gems; characters talk the way real people talk, with imperfection and idiosyncrasy.Pitt, Hill, and Hoffman all inhabit their roles perfectly. Because they're gifted actors, but because of how well written their characters are.The pacing is just right, and the Bill James stuff comes in at just the right time. Yeah, it would be nice if Peter Brand was the one who came up with Moneyball or ""sabermetrics"" (a term smartly not used in the film), but it's okay that he's using another system.

"Great book, mediocre movie","The book was fascinating. The script for the movie, at least Brad Pitt's part, is terrible. His character is pretty unbelievable. He disagrees with his scouts but usually gives no explanation as to why. The writers were just concerned about setting up the ""dramatic conflict"" and not about writing realistic interactions. As a result the movie fails to capture, in any but the most superficial way, the changing vision of how players were valued. It was a seismic shift in ""America's pastime.""

Sorkin Elevates a Baseball Stat Story into a Human Story,"MONEYBALL (A-): Steve Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin's adaptation of Michael Lewis' book plays fast and loose with the historical facts (what else is new?), but is able to smartly zero in on the crossroads between the vision behind the ""moneyball"" stats revolution and the flesh and blood drama provided by Billy Beane and the 2002 Oakland Athletics baseball season. I love when movies take the central conflict of a story, in this case the small market Oakland Athletics competing against the big market New York Yankees, and discovering how that conflict, and the answers we find to it, are often mirrored in the human journey. Bennet Miller brings the screenplay to life with a pseudo-documentary take that when blended with some real live footage and commentary, gives the whole thing an air of ""seeing behind the curtain."" Brad Pitt gives a great ""movie star"" performance here and Jonah Hill has great chemistry here as his numbers crunching sidekick. There's a number of great dialogue sequences and one of my favorite ""character realizes they have accomplished their goal"" moments - even if it's a bit on the nose.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Enjoyable, even as a non-baseball enthusiast","As we all know, the best films that revolve around a particular sport are the ones that can be shown to anyone and they'd still enjoy themselves. This is what Moneyball got right thanks to great performances all around from Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill, the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman and an excellent child's turn from Kerris Dorsey.Some serious credit must also be given to Wally Pfister who shot the film with such detail, cleverness and expressiveness that almost each and every shot conveys the story of each scene perfectly.Moneyball is a sports drama that others within the genre should take notes from and has a screenplay that ranks among some of the best that I have come across.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Had a ball watching Moneyball!,"I am ready to spill the beans on the baseball management flick ""Moneyball"". So let me pitch it to you, because it's a good one. Director Bennett Miller's film adaptation of the true story of Oakland A's General Manager Billy Beane's creative non-spending architecture of putting a winning team in the field without spending the big dough is sure to have its own winning streak during movie awards season. The Beane computer-generated player analysis technique has been a trendsetter that many other Major League Baseball clubs have used. ""Moneyball"" is set during the 2002 Oakland A's season who many thought was going to be an ""F"" graded one for the Athletics. Beane me up some Brad! Because Brad Pitt's exemplary starring performance as Billy Beane does not have to be computer-analyzed to prove that it's as solid as they come for a leading actor this year. Mr. Pitt is no longer the pretty boy actor, his work throughout the last few years have proved that he is one of the best actors in the business; besides being sought after by many Major League Studios in Hollywood. ""Moneyball"" sure had a lot of Miller time on it, maybe not personally on screen but on development; because Director Bennett Miller's acute management of the movie gets my vote as an all-star auteur effort for 2011; and Miller's fluid direction authenticated the fact that you don't have to be a baseball fan to enjoy this film, because its major narrative hit is showcasing how to deliver a winning product with budget restrains. Hall of Fame screenwriters Aaron Sorkin and Steven Zaillian did threw a few curve balls and did change it up a bit in their ""Moneyball"" script enough to base it as what can be the premier screenplay of the year. The supporting players of ""Moneyball"" also brought their A game! Jonah Hill was spectacular as Beane's economic-wiz apprentice Peter Brand. Phillip Seymour Hoffman was a piece of art as A's Manager Art Howe. And Chris Pratt brought the right balance of nervousness and opportunity as A's player Scott Hatterberg. But overall this was mainly Pitt's playing thespian field and he sure made the best of every opportunity he got up at the acting plate. ""Moneyball"" may or may not roll large amounts of moneyballs in the box office, but it is definitively ""so money"" and I hope everybody knows it. ***** Excellent",,Anonymous,Biography
On the money. Ball.,"I think the first thing you need to realize about Moneyball is that it's not really a baseball movie at all. It's about innovation in the face of intractable, tradition-bound, go-by-the-gut senses. New thinking versus old thinking. In presenting the view that concentrating on why a particular player is more valuable to a team than another, rather than on his star power or high-profile personality or the number of home runs he's hit is not only prudent but necessary when a team has little money to spend, the movie is an unqualified success. Billy Beane (Brad Pitt, nominated for an Oscar) is the general manager of the Oakland Athletics, a team with a small payroll that must compete with bigger-market teams like the Yankees and Red Sox. The Athletics are not unsuccessful, but they can't quite win it all. When three of their big stars leave via free agency one off season, Beane decides to replace them with players who are not only affordable but who can offer, in composite, more return than the departing trio. Beane's reasoning is that in order to win, a team must score runs. To score runs, a player must get on base. Getting on base is the single most important part of winning. So while other teams make use of players who can hit home runs and steal bases (and pay said players countless millions), Oakland goes after players who can simply get on base.That this is anathema to the Way the Game Is Played would be an understatement. No one's really paid attention to the more obscure statistics, like OBP (on-base percentage), because who cares? Give me 40 home runs and a 120 RBI, and we'll win. Well, Oakland can't afford that guy, so how about three guys who combined make less than that guy but get on base more often. That's more practical.Beane is assisted by virtually no one. His manager, Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffmann) despises Beane's attempts to manipulate the batting order to his liking. His scouts are all stuck in the mud of 1932 and refuse to change. Even the players are a little skeptical. But Peter Brand (Jonah Hill, also nominated for an Oscar), gets it. A true stats nerd – he majored in economics at Yale – Brand understands the weaknesses and strengths better than any general manager, field manager, or player ever could, because he's crunched the numbers and has data to back up his assertions.Pitt and Hill are both amazing and have excellent on-screen chemistry. That's not a sentence I figured I'd ever type. Hill isn't playing just some nebbish who cowers in front of Beane or a player; he's his own man, just a little withdrawn and seemingly out of his element. Both actors take great pains to involve the audience in their stories; otherwise, this would be just a movie about pencil-necked geeks playing simulated games on a computer and expecting the real world to do the same.The movie takes place in 2002 and is based on fact, but even so I won't spoil the ending for you now. But I will note this much for sure: Beane's overall philosophy has been adapted to such a wide extent over the past decade that Oakland now must find a new angle to exploit that the bigger teams haven't yet found. The very idea that there are more important stats than the typical power numbers turns baseball upside down, shakes it hard, and collects the loose change. To use a cliché, this was a teachable moment for baseball executives across America, and although it took a while for many to catch on, catch on they did.Even if one removed the many baseball scenes, the movie would still work. It's honest, true to itself, and doesn't digress into meaningless side plots, like forced romance or witty banter. But the baseball action, the result of Beane's work behind the scenes, sells it completely.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Insights from numbers,"While certainly a great movie about the game of baseball, there are so many valuable insights as well relating to the creative way that patterns can be detected by stepping back and observing the picture that numbers can draw out for us. In many of those instances we are able to confirm what seems so obvious, yet in some cases it helps us to think about what is really at the heart of something. With Moneyball, it's about ""Get on base"", and however that might happen... a player who's good at seeing balls versus strikes, a player who's good at stealing bases, a player who gets more singles than doubles or triples. The cast is amazing, and the story timeless. A must see!

A struggle if you don't follow baseball,"POSITIVES:1) The performances are excellent, especially Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill. It's a really star studded cast that also includes Chris Pratt and Philip Seymour Hoffman, and I'd say that everyone delivers a really great performance.2) The film oozes class. You just get the sense while watching it that you're watching something really high quality that was made with a lot of care and with masters of their craft in basically every department.3) By the third act of the film, I was certainly invested and caring about whether the A's were going to win or not, especially as I didn't know what happened in real life.NEGATIVES:1) The film is very very slow paced, especially in the first two acts, before almost speeding through the third act with just a mass montage of baseball games. I feel the pacing should've been more even throughout.2) I didn't care about Billy's personal life with his ex and his daughter at all. I didn't think this was well developed and none of the other characters even get any kind of personal development whatsoever.3) As a Brit, I don't follow baseball and I think that definitely hampers the experience. I could understand the general points around cost cutting and trying to win on a small budget, that's a universal experience that everyone goes through at some point, but I couldn't understand a lot of the terminology around the baseball games themselves and I didn't think the scenes filmed during the actual baseball games were very engaging at all.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Well-Acted Story of Innovation and Perseverance,"""Moneyball"" is a thought-provoking sports drama based on the true story of Billy Beane (played by Brad Pitt), the general manager of the Oakland Athletics, who revolutionized baseball by using data-driven analytics to build a competitive team on a small budget. Directed by Bennett Miller, the film explores themes of innovation, perseverance, and defying tradition.Brad Pitt delivers a strong performance as Beane, capturing his frustration, determination, and personal struggles. Jonah Hill, in a standout role as Peter Brand, the young statistician who assists Beane, adds a quieter, more intellectual layer to the film, bringing a fresh dynamic to their partnership. The performances are one of the movie's highlights, and the chemistry between Pitt and Hill is engaging.However, while the film does a great job of highlighting the human side of Beane's journey, it can sometimes feel slow-paced, especially for those not familiar with the intricacies of baseball. The script, while solid, occasionally leans too heavily on a predictable narrative arc. The pacing can dip at times, making the movie feel more like a series of connected moments rather than a fully gripping experience from start to finish.In the end, ""Moneyball"" is an enjoyable, well-acted film that offers an insightful look at a game-changing moment in baseball history. It's not a groundbreaking movie in terms of storytelling, but its strong performances and the fascinating subject matter make it a solid watch. A solid movie for its engaging premise, strong cast, and inspirational message, despite its occasional pacing issues.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"I am a sports fan, though not of baseball and yet the film inspires","Love this!'Moneyball' is sensational! I enjoyed every second of the 134 minute run time. Great acting, brilliantly shot, notably scored, nicely paced - all of that and more.Even at the beginning of the film, where it's basically just the (you'd assume dull) board meetings/negotiations, I was already gripped. Everything then builds to the action, which eventually arrives to give things a new lease of life. Never a boring moment, at least for me.The sporting side is ideally told, despite the sizeable use of real life footage as opposed to newly captured content - which was a smart call, by the way. All the while connecting the characters and making us care for them.Brad Pitt plays lead as Billy Beane, fantastically I must add. He gives the perfect performance, absolutely nothing to negatively note about it - except the cup spitting, though that's a film thing rather than him.Jonah Hill is also impressive here, as he's suited to composite character Peter Brand well. The support cast are ace too, namely Philip Seymour Hoffman (Art Howe).It's all riveting stuff.

Professionally well-made movie that's totally engaging.,"A well-written engaging screenplay. It's well acted, the characters seem very real, and the conduct between those characters is interesting. It's well shot, frames look professional. The movie's more about the things that happen behind the sport rather than the sport, so you don't really have to know much about baseball for this to interest you. Infact the movie spends very little screentime on the field showing the game. So it's not a regular cinematic sports drama but a documentary flavoured one.

David and Goliath plays out in the sport of Baseball,"Moneyball, starring Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill is a sports film that is more about the struggle of ""rich -vs- poor than it is about the actual game itself. Pitt plays the lead character, Billy Beane who as the Oakland A's General Manager changed the way the game is played forever back in the 2002 season. After having his best free agent players swooned with big money by the Yankee organization, Beane is forced to re- build his team by using mathematical statistics introduced to him by Paul Brand (Jonah Hill.) The film emphasizes on Beane's struggle with the sport with occasional flashbacks to his past experience as a player in the big leagues in the 1980s. The narration of the film seems to dictate that his past history with the sport is one of the driving forces on how he manages the Oakland A's. The relationship with his ex-wife and daughter also play a key factor in his decision making process.Pitt's performance is solid and charismatic and on track with his streak of solid work throughout the last few years (Inglourious Basterds,The Tree of Life.) Jonah Hill has stepped out from behind his usual comedy character role's to show that he has what it takes to be a serious actor.) Other co-starring roles are on key throughout the film; Phillip Seymour Hoffman as Team Manager Art Howe being one of them.One does not need to be a sports fanatic to enjoy this film. Moneyball is a film based on a baseball team, but it goes beyond being a film about a baseball team and more about one man's vision and determination to change the system of how the game is played.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Entertaining,"I enjoyed this movie, mainly due to the fact that the 2002 Oakland a's were from my generation when I was a teenage baseball fan. the movie was entertaining because I can see the story of how a baseball team and different players of that time were built. I enjoyed thinking back to myself remember that player or remember this game or that game? Although the movie is based on a true story, a lot of it is fictionalized. Brad Pitt turned the character of Billy Beene into a smooth overconfident guy that he was not in real life.I enjoyed the movie because of the time line of it, and overall it was a good baseball movie. However i don't understand the point of making this movie. MoneyBall is about a good baseball team that over-achieved and had a good season but went no where after. The billy Beane Oakland a's never won anything, so I don't even understand the point of making this movie. I think a movie about the 2002 angels who unexpectedly won the world series would have made for a better story.Money ball is a watchable entertaining baseball movie, that appealed even more to me due to the time it's story took place.

More than just a sport story.,"To compare America's pastime with something more relevant in Britain would probably frustrate American's the world over, so I won't even attempt it. I thought the topic of the film would be lost on me considering my typically British upbringing, but there is so much more to Moneyball than just the sport of baseball.Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill bounce off each other so well (I wanted to be sat in-between them chuckling to myself), especially during the introduction of Hill's character Peter, with everything he said seeming to sound like an apology and Pitt's Billy Beane basically telling him to man up. The supporting cast did a superb job of looking dumbfounded when the new strategy of baseball drafting was presented to them, created awkward moments even Woody Allen would be proud of.The mix of archive footage with the newly filmed, brings an air of nostalgia that's really fitting. Without the back-story of Billy Beane creating the emotional connection we, as an audience, need, there would be no story at all (apart from that of which we could read on Wikipedia), but with this, there is enough narrative to entice even the most British of non-baseball fans.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The stats don't add up,"In this film, the protagonist (Athletics GM Billy Beane) prevails because of his revolutionary approach, analytics, which--in its simplest form, according to the movie--focuses on acquiring hitters who get on base a lot (walk a lot). The film makes us believe that the 2002 Athletics are talent-deprived and ended up winning 103 games due to Beane's ingenious new concept: analytics.But in reality, it's not quite what happened. Yes, Oakland had a low budget, but they had a ton of super-talented young players whom they could afford because they didn't yet qualify for free agency. These young stars included the brilliant starting pitching trio of Mulder, Zito, and Hudson (57-21 combined that year), plus superstar infielders Eric Chavez and Miguel Tejada, who combined for 68 homers and 240 RBI. David Justice and Jermaine Dye also swung bit sticks.As for walking a lot, Oakland finished just fifth in the AL in on-base percentage in 2002 at .339, which was just .008 above the league average. Statistically, I doubt that .008 stat equated to one victory above the AL average. And here's the kicker, that .339 OBP was lower than what Oakland recorded the year before (.345).So...I don't get it.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

"A Total Bore, Even to an Avid Baseball Fan","First and foremost, I want everyone to know that I love baseball and I do understand the intricacies associated with the game, and the fact that the A's were competing with a payroll of 1/3rd of the Yankees is very significant. However, I found the story line to be extremely slow, and boring.I came into this movie totally hyped up and excited about a baseball movie after way too long of a wait. I went to a matinée with only about 20 other people there to watch the movie on opening day (I know it was early but 20 is very low). Most of them seemed like avid fans as well, judging by their giggles at some of the jokes (very few) in the movie. The first thirty minutes were O.K., as it was meant to build the story line and introduce the characters. That was understandable, what was not, was the fact that the story didn't capture my attention any more throughout the the next one hour or so. I believe that the movie touched upon three players, mostly the first basemen and their transition to becoming an Athletic. I also felt that the movie focused way to much on Brad Pitt and Billy Beane, and I understand that he is the GM that revolutionized the game, but the character development really didn't reach a climax. Billy Beane had the same attitude towards baseball, and his life in general, as he did in the start. And the two hours that it took to get to that point really didn't accomplish much. I also felt that the climax of the movie was VERY rushed, it was condensed into 15 minutes that really didn't have me very interested, rather had me thinking to myself ""what the hell just happened"".Overall, I believe the movie was a total let down, and even Brad Pitt's and Jonah Hill's presence isn't enough to keep baseball fans (let alone casual viewers) interested. I am going to be generous and give this film 5 stars out of 10, although I hope I could get those wasted two hours back of my life, to do something meaningful, like watching ""Major League"".",,Anonymous,Biography

Wish it might be Freeball,"It's all true. Everything you've heard. MONEYBALL is ""not just another baseball movie."" But, Lord, give me FIELD OF DREAMS, give me LITTLE BIG LEAGUE, even give me ANGELS IN THE OUTFIELD. But keep MONEYBALL away.I will concede that the film looks wonderful. It has rich darks and infinite blacks, excellent shadows, and pale whites. The shots down long bending stadium corridors are magnificently focused and clean. The film even has an incredibly underrated script. It is full of natural dialogue with organic pauses, repetitions, and idiosyncrasies. The words have such strong rhythm.Why doesn't the story? MONEYBALL is the story of a great film that was murdered in the editing room. At least 15 minutes could have been edited out of the second and third acts. The analytic neatness embedded in the theme is destroyed by disjunct editing that recklessly jumps from scenario to scenario with wobbly confidence. It's as if the editor was just following the script and putting in the first take he or she could find then letting it play until another switch was necessary. It results in a very sloppy picture. I don't like complaining about this, but the movie is ABOUT NUMBERS, MATH, AND ANALYSIS.Also, MONEYBALL frequently attempts to employ the inspirational music device while talking about using players who have been numerically overlooked by other franchises. First of all, it is cheap emotion. Second, it is cheap metaphor. Third, it is a bad metaphor. The underdog theory and the BPitt/JHill vs. Everyone bout becomes exhausting. The real problem is that there are no stakes.No stakes. No personal relationships. No attachments. We are even told that the GM isn't supposed to have close relationships with players. The audience is not full of players. We are never given access to anything interesting or sympathetic about these characters. We see a touch of Billy's past and his failure. In fact, Brad Pitt does a fairly good piece of work in this role. It is understated and precise, a much more difficult character than he might generally see. Either way, as the pressure and focus turns onto the players and the game during the final act, the audience is left with nothing on which to hold. MONEBALL fails to establish any kind of emotional pivot and, as a result, a great adaptation and a great story lose popular sympathy even in a brilliantly shot, lit, scripted, and acted work.54.9",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

Moneyball hits a home run with remarkable directing and performances and an intriguing true story that drastically changed everything for the sport of baseball.,"Moneyball is as brilliant and interesting as a sports movie gets. Bennett Miller's genius use of the film's score enhances the emotion and tension by letting the film's most intense moments hang in silence. As a result, the audience feels a more profound impact from those scenes and the relief when the score returns, signaling hope and resolution. Miller also uses Brad Pitt's greatest strengths as an actor by providing plenty of playful banter and clever exchanges between his character and the various players, managers, and staff. Pitt's powerful emotion shines brightest in the scenes with his character's daughter showing a struggle to hide his fear for his future and ability to provide for his family while standing for what he believes.

Slow-paced but engaging story that benefits from charismatic performances from the leads,"The Oscar nominations this week just added to the reasons I had for wanting to see a film that had been surprisingly praised in the UK when it first came out. I do like baseball – not enough to watch it for hours and hours every few days but enough to go see a game when I'm in the US or sit in a bar there for the important games, but with Moneyball the subject is less the action on the field but more the discussions in the offices. The result of this is a film that lacks the big emotional moments of action that you'll get with other baseball movies, but instead produces a really nice slow-burn that satisfies and engages throughout.The way it does this is deceptive because it seems all very easy because it doesn't have any moments of ""big"" writing, no dialogue that soars above the audience, no one moment where the film is all tied up or where the audience feels the urge to applaud. Instead it is really quite natural throughout and it makes for an engaging way to tell the story. The stats are made accessible and the viewer is brought inside the day-to-day of making the approach work but where it really succeeds is in the telling of Beane's story – of him overcoming doubters, sticking to his gut (ironically given his approach) and making it work. He is the heart of the film and he is the reason why I didn't mind spending the games with him, unable to see what was happening but still feeling like I was in the right place.Pitt is a massive part of this working as well as it does and it is why he got the acting nod. He is natural, charismatic but uses his star-power well to have presence but not to be distant from the viewer. As he has gotten older he seems to have added layers to his acting ability and this and Tree of Life marks an excellent year for him. He is well supported by Jonah Hill who doesn't play up the comedy fat-guy role he so often has, but instead is nervy, insecure and intelligent and the pairing makes for a good combination throughout. Supporting roles are equally good and the film generally has a natural and engaging feel of reality.It must be said that Moneyball is a slow film and those expecting big moments or something thrilling will be prone to disappointment but this will be to do with their expectations, not the film. In place of this the film produces great performances, a natural air, an accessible tone and a roundly satisfying and engagingly-told story. It won't blow you out of your seat, but it is a solidly strong film from start to finish.",,Anonymous,Biography
Nice story about an otherwise boring sport,"What I liked most about the movie Moneyball is that it's a feel good story within itself. It starts off suggesting that the reason the Oakland A's lost to the New York Yankees in the 2001 ADLS is because they were out-salaried. Then the team loses three of its big- name players to bigger markets.The GM, Billy Beane (Brad Pitt), can't convince the owner to increase the 2002 budget, so he takes it out on the team's collection of seasoned scouts. ""Blah blah blah,"" he mimics with his hand as they run through the usual criteria used for considering up-and- coming and free-agent players. ""He's seen in Vegas too much."" ""He doesn't have the confidence because his wife is a six, at best."" Billy offers no solutions, but only frustration.It's by chance that, while going through his usual motions of horse-trading with another team, Billy stumbles upon a new methodology for ranking players. Enter Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), a baseball aficionado and techno-nerd. The analytical data used by Peter is so in-depth it made me wonder where the human element of each player began on paper and the machine element ended.The season starts out shaky as under-appreciated manager Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman) holds firm on who plays what position in spite of the GM's insistence that an unorthodox approach needs to be given a chance. Since baseball is a business, Billy is forced to make some heartless trades that force the skipper to do things his way. As a result, the A's start climbing up the division ladder and even challenge the all-time record for consecutive wins. It's at this point where I felt the movie was trying to create a special moment. And it does. What's funny is I don't recall this historical moment from only nine years ago. (In fact, I think I'll probably be more apt to always remember that fictionalized moment in the movie Tin Cup where Roy McAvoy holes out, from 250 yards away, the final hole of the Championship tournament.) But for this movie's sake, the moment illustrates how a bunch of over-the-hill and no-name players can come together, rising above both the excessive commercialism and sanitized tedium that makes up the sport today, and make history.The team's record in 2002 was only one win better than the previous season. And they once again lose in the ADLS, only this time to another small market team, the Minnesota Twins. It's this data that makes me appreciate the movie as merely a noble highlight of the game of baseball rather than as a tale of a revolutionary league-changing strategy.Billy Beane's still the GM for the A's and the team's record has been average overall since 2002. After offering Billy the highest salary for a GM ever, the Red Sox go it alone, eventually breaking the Curse of the Bambino in 2004 while using both a big salary and sterile computer analysis. I suspect the romanticism of the movie hides the fact that big market teams can still make use of the new system of ranking players to help maintain their continued degree of big-payroll success. And, of course, once every team in the league has adopted this new approach, then it's back to square one, i.e., trying to find a way to beat a big market team with a low salary.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Moneyball,"I am literally have no any idea about baseball and cannot extract any gaiety or thrill from watching it (actually I am very much sport-immune). So the challenge of the film lies in the fact that whether or not it will be able to win over more spectators who are usually out of the range of the sport genre, just like two years ago THE BLINDSIDE (2009) did (I know nothing about American football either but I emphatically enjoyed the film).Taking Pitt's role Billy Beane's words said to his assistant Peter Brand (career-best performance from Jonah Hill) in the film, ""he does not want to have any personal entanglement with any of his players, especially no emotion attached"" (not literally though) , the film also detaches from its audience by throwing mathematic formulae and analytic statistics at the audience and imposes a condescending stance to water down the scientific theory so as to be accepted by outsiders like me. Also the narrative process is no less median than other sport biopics (namely, INVICTUS 2009, a same 6/10 rating), an over-abused underdog victory with a middle- of-the-road taste.The cast, I cannot deny it may be Pitt's best work so far (leaving THE TREE OF LIFE aside), but one hindrance is his subdued swagger almost pervasive in almost every film he stars and I have watched, which could be fitting in FIGHT CLUB 1999 or TWELVE MONKEYS 1995, even for OCEAN'S ELEVEN series, but in a biographic film, Mr. Jolie is not an acting chameleon like Meryl Streep, and he should drink the so-called ""make-up potion"" to camouflage himself behind his role he plays. Additionally among the small satellites revolving around Pitt, Jonah Hill is seriously rooting for his first Oscar nomination (congratulations on his dual nominations in both SAG and Golden Globe, the same to Pitt and the film has nailed 4 Golden Globe nominations in toto, BEST MOTION PICTURE-DRAMA and BEST SCREENPLAY). Another VIP star Philip Seymour Hoffman has nothing to sprawl out in his funny uniform.Oscar nominated director Bennett Miller (CAPOTE 2005) may fall short of strong buzz to get himself into Oscar's consideration, however, the film is exquisitely made and the lengthy spiels which I shudder at may fare pretty well as the crowd-pleaser for those interlacing with both film and baseball domains.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

http://tgtbtw.blogspot.com/,"Nominated for 6 Oscars, Moneyball is based on the true story of the General Manager of the Oakland Athletics, and his underdog team that almost made it to the championship in 2002. The General Manager at the time, Billy Beane, played by Brad Pitt, had to make drastic changes to his teams lineup, due to the fact that the A's had no money to pay for their star players. When it came time to scout for new players, the rest of the staff was doing things the old way. Billy Beane and his new Assistant G.M., Peter Brand saw baseball a whole different way. Based on the books by baseball writer and historian, Bill James; Peter had come up with a system based on math, to theoretically draft the best baseball team at a much smaller cost.Billy Beane himself was an MLB player, and started his career out at the New York Mets. It started his senior year in high school, when he was offered a full ride to Stanford to play baseball, but he chose to go to the New York Mets instead. What the scouts did not realize is that he was not cut out to actually play in the major leagues. Whether it was his confidence level, or just pure luck that he made it that far. It was made clear to him after he had been traded multiple times that he was not cut out for the major leagues.His story as a teenager is similar in many ways to his career as a General Manager, and that is what Moneyball effectively accomplishes. Since the beginning of baseball, scouts have been using the same techniques and statistics to find the best players, and it does not always work. Billy saw this at a young age, and it affected him the rest of his life. The scouts saw him statistically as the best player to join the major leagues, but what they could not find out is how he was actually going to turn out under pressure, and what type of person Billy was going to become as he grew up. Peter's new way of finding players for the major league still used statistics of course, but it ruled out certain aspects, such as, age, weight, injuries etc. The Oakland A's main focus now was who can make the most runs, because at the most simplistic form, runs are what win the game for the team.Brad Pitt puts on a superb performance much like he always does, and shows the frustration that Billy must have been going through those rough years as a G.M., as he was reminded of his younger years playing in the MLB. I definitely think Brad Pitt deserves to be up for best Actor, and I hope he does get it. Everyone else in the movie did great playing the supporting roles, and making the experience much more enjoyable. Jonah Hill did a good job playing Peter Brand, but for me I always see him as goofy Jonah Hill. About half way through it I adjusted and he actually turned out to be great for the part. It would be amazing for him if he actually wins his supporting role, so he could break out of his comedic shell and do more serious roles like this one.Moneyball accomplishes everything it is supposed to. It makes us want the Oakland A's to win the championship, even though we already know the outcome of the game, and we want Billy and Peter's ideas to work out, and for them to be successful. It's a wonderful story of the underdog, and even if they don't come out on top, they still accomplished so much for how small of a team they started out as. All that being said, I still don't think its best film worthy. It is a great story, and is definitely one of the best sports films in a long time, but it was not the most groundbreaking film of the year.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Touching and powerful,"I'm eleven years late to the party, but glad I showed up. What an incredible film this is.Brad Pitt's performance is good. Really good. Jonah Hill is equally impressive in his meek but powerful roll.

I've watched a lot of sports true-story movies, and they don't always do this. Sometimes they're too glossy, to polished up, too surface.

"Even better than the book. I forgive both for pretending Bean's ""new strategy"" really worked.","Pitt & J Hill are fabulous in this. Baseball is a good topic. The screenplay is fine.

Really? In his 4 years in Boston, Damon was a key part of helping the Sox make it to the ALCS 2x & winning the World Series once. Key as in getting 3 hits & 6 RBIs in game 7 of the World Series. And then the Yankees gave Damon a 50% raise to steal him from the Sox.Pretending about Moneyball, Pt 1: In the film, they ignore OAK's great starting pitching, which was not due to ""moneyball"". They also ignore OAK's top players like Tejada, although when they're showing OAK's wins in its winning streak, Tejada's name keeps popping up.Pretending about Moneyball, Pt 3: In the book, they spend page after page on how Bean drafted due to Moneyball as if it was a big success.

Much more than just a baseball film,Its a masterpiece for me. The story has been told in an excellent manner that even if you don't understand baseball you would still be excited for what's coming next and with each situation there is a connect to the audience with the main character.Overall I really liked Moneyball and the message it conveys in a subtle manner. It really provokes a thought or two during last few scenes and also there is an emotional connect with the story.Brad Pitt as usual has done a remarkable work along with Jonah Hill and other actors.I loved it and I will highly recommend this film to everyone who likes good storytelling and with a bit of interest in sports in general.,9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Foul Ball,"""Moneyball"" is a ""based on"" sports flick that endeavors to bring the Oakland A's 2002 season to the silver screen, via the perspective of its general manager Billy Beane. While the story manages to convey the injustice of high-budget teams owning the game by proxy of their wealth, the story's execution of Beane as a character compounded with a number of awkward thematic choices put the film several runs behind.Concerning the plot, the narrative follows Billy around as he struggles to fight against a system that is perpetually rigged against him and the team he manages: one in which the ""best"" players go to the teams with the deepest pockets. After stumbling upon Peter Brand, a Baseball enthusiast who judges a player's worth solely upon their statistics, Beane concocts a plan to create a winning team made up of unwanted and undervalued players that have been overlooked for any number of reasons. Ultimately, Billy and Peter fail to bring the A's the victory they were hoping for, but the film closes with a reminder that the strategy they employed would later go on to revolutionize the game and bring a World Series championship to another team that later used it. While this works for the overall story the film is trying to convey, there were a few points of focus that failed to connect in terms of the bigger picture. For example, the movie uses up a considerable amount of screen time covering the A's iconic twentieth-in-a-row victory that established a new historical record. This victory is immediately undercut by Billy, however, who laments that it wouldn't matter how many games they won should they still lose the World Series. The film subsequently follows this up by showing the game that lost them the season for all but a few seconds. In essence, the writers glossed over the point in the journey that should have been the emotional climax for a game that the main character himself disregarded as being insignificant.In terms of the characters, most are average and enjoyable. Peter maintains an optimistic perspective through much of the film, the misfit players who were given screen time were fun to watch more often than not, and Billy's daughter brought a positive atmosphere into the scenes she took part in. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for Billy. His actor's portrayal depicts him as an insufferable, brooding idealist in the beginning of the film and he maintains this persona through to the end. Additionally, his penchant for throwing frequent tantrums, and subsequently the nearest object in the room, likened him more to petty child than a struggling and sympathetic adult. Lastly, the overall contempt and disregard he showed toward others that stood in the way of his vision was nothing short of grating. An example of this would be his actions around the A's downtrodden coach, Art, who's bid for a decent contract and vote of confidence are ignored and upon who's lap the controversial group of players are dropped with no warning; effectively setting him up to fail should the experiment fall through. Though the film tries to paint Beane as a sympathetic victim through his failures in the past to perform as a player, it disregards following up on the point that he still made the decision to become one regardless of the scouting error that gave him the choice. Had his presentation been toned down a few notches, this might have been less noticeable and more forgivable in the long run.In conclusion, ""Moneyball"" is the middling result of a solid concept with poor execution. Sitting at over two hours in runtime with a number of scenarios that could have been reworked or integrated elsewhere, the pacing felt patted out rather than concise. Though it can doubtlessly still be watched as a ""feel good"" film to scratch that baseball itch, it remains a big swing and a miss from what it had the potential to be.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Pretty solid. Even for non-baseball fans.,"Three words: Moneyball was pleasant. More-so though if you know anything about or care at all about baseball. I do not. So there were several looooong moments where I felt suspended in stat and technicality limbo. I can't decide if I felt satisfied with how it ended. In particular, the song playing as the ending narratives were displayed made me feel sad for our antagonist instead of proud, as I should have. However, the overall movie was good. And it's based on a true story so it just is what it is. Kinda your typical underdog-athletic-team-triumphs-against- the-odds type movie. Though it was clearly more of a tale of Billy Beane, the team GM, than of one about the Oakland As. Which was the point. It's not necessarily about winning it all (though that would be nice). It's about challenging the status quo.Where the movie loses many people in baseball tedium, it more than substantially makes up for in comedy. Clever comedy though. There's just no way the movie would have been the same without Jonah Hill. He was such a smart casting choice and if you're a fan of his, you won't be disappointed. It's really cool to see that he can still be hilarious outside of the Superbad/Forgetting Sarah Marshall type stuff we're used to seeing him in.

Good Sports Story,"This is based upon a true story.As General Manager for the Oakland Athletics baseball team, Billy Beane (Pitt) decides to revamp the game of baseball using statistics to select players. The stats are provided by Peter Brand (Hill), a numbers cruncher, Billy hires away from the Cleveland Indians.This gives us a pretty good view of how baseballs' General Managers operate and what they have to deal with. In this case Billy has to deal with more than most since he and Peter go against baseball lore, wisdom, history, scouts' analysis, long time baseball men and, of course, his manager on the field, Art Howe (Seymour Hoffman). And, the way things start out, these new ideas don't have the fans on board either.I did expect this to be more emotional as you would find in most true sports stories. I was hoping that it would not change me from the team I sometimes root for to be a Oakland Athletics fan.The pacing, dialogues, and good acting by all held me and I didn't need the Kleenex tissues by my side that are mandatory for watching true stories. You just know you are going to need them. But not this time. Although, I almost reached for the box during one of the last scenes when Billy was driving aimlessly (he does that) and listening to his daughter singing a song for him on the CD. I thought: here it comes as he has a big decision to make.This is a very good baseball story, but I don't see any Oscars for anyone in here. However, I am sure Brad Pitt will be nominated anyway. He is a terrific actor.There is a statement at the end of the movie that says when the Boston Red Sox won the World Series two years later they used a statistical system similar to Billy's.

It's the ultimate underdog team.This film showcases the rise of the use of sports science, which is widely used and considered a crucial aspect of every sport today.But this time Billy Beane makes it work like no one else ever could , his team reaches big heights and breaks unprecedented records, thus popularizing their ""Moneyball"" philosophy which later on the Red Sox of Boston would go onto use and would spread to other territories like English Football predominantly in Liverpool FC.The performances are great, Brad Pitt gives one of his best performances of his career and Jonah Hill is brilliant as his assistant Peter.Philip Seymour Hoffman does a good job with the small role he has plus the daughter of Billy Beane is a heartwarming presence.The filmaking is the real hero here, with a screenplay that never loses any focus on it's characters, the seamless editing that helps you reach the critical points coupled with a great score that just makes the entire experience a memorable one.The film reaches emotional heights along with the tense sports moments,
Billy's determination and strive for success due to his failure in the same sport as a player drives him forward and forms one of the core aspect of the film.

Baseball + Statistics = ?,"""Moneyball"" is about the very American sport of baseball and the objective science of statistics. It recounts how in 2001, ex-ball player Billy Beane, then general manager of the bottom-dwelling and budget-strapped Oakland A's, turned the fortunes of the whole team around by hiring lower-value but talented players based solely on their game statistics. It certainly took a lot of time getting to that main part of the story, but when it got there, you will be rewarded for your patience.Brad Pitt is admittedly too ""movie-starrish"" to really disappear into the role of Billy Beane. Put him in a room full of grumpy grizzled old baseball curmudgeons, and he would really stand out like, well, a movie star. While I understand why he is gaining awards recognition for this role, I feel the role may be too understated and underplayed by him. Pitt was effective, yes, but may be too low-key for the big Oscar prize.Beane's ""side-kick"" here was Peter Brand (played by pudgy comedian Jonah Hill), a nerdy Yale graduate of Economics who introduced how statistics can be of use to Beane in scouting for players under a limited budget. Hill plays it like he was always in awe of Pitt. On the other side, Philip Seymour Hoffman plays team manager Art Howe, who was disdainful of Beane's radically new scouting style. If he was supposed to be annoying, then Hoffman surely played it that way.I watched ""Moneyball"" only because star Brad Pitt has been gaining awards buzz from it, and in fact had won a number of critics awards already. I had absolutely no idea what it was all about before I watched. Even as I was already watching, I had a difficult time getting into the story because it tells about something I am not very familiar with.

"Not earth-shattering, but quite an experience","*** out of (****)Going into ""Moneyball"", it was moreso dependent on my absolute Aaron Sorkin fetish and a quite intrigue in digesting all the Oscar-buzzing films I could possibly take in. I was never a fan of Pitt. Don't get me wrong, the guy has the chops, but he never astounded me before. Well... now he has. In this 2011 baseball extravaganza, Pitt gives it his all and Sorkin knocks this one out of the park (pun-intended), with his incredible script. But let's not have director Miller's thunder stolen away with this very competently directed picture.The story of Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane's successful attempt to put together a baseball club on a budget by employing computer-generated analysis to draft his players.Solely looking at the premise, I merely just copied and pasted, seeing as how I couldn't summarize it better than if I tried. Anyway, what's interesting for this review is that I've never been drawn to sports. Being a heterosexual male, you'd probably revoke my penis card, but in all honesty, I really haven't, especially baseball. But you know what? With the way the story was presented, I actually was indulged in the premise. That and having some spectacular performances didn't hurt either.The cinematography is just the icing on the cake. The scenes in this film are just beautifully shot and all around are an enhancement to an already solid movie. However, this isn't the movie I expect to either get an Oscar or create an earth-shattering hoopla. The film does take awhile to get the ball rolling and the resolution isn't entirely all that satisfactory, but what we have for the bulk of the movie is good.All in all, ""Moneyball"" is not entirely what I expected it to be. Coming from a non-sports addict, it impressed me in more ways than most films of this genre did. That truly says something about the performers, the director, and the writer(s).

Exploration of Unconventional and Unpopular Computerization of ML Baseball tale told in an emotionally distant manner,"Bill James is lionized here by main character Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) and cohort ""Peter Brand"" (Jonah Hill in the film's only engaging performance). However, only 4 main concepts are touch upon: On-Base Percentage, never intentionally walk a batter, avoid bunting, and avoid stealing. I agree with all four principles. Inly the first is dwelt upon at length. Other favorite categories of Bill James are ignored. As is the fact that the team had 3 great starters - Barry Zito, a certain Hall of Famer who won the Cy Young was not even mentioned. That said, as a lifetime baseball fan, I enjoyed the baseball angle of the movie as well as taking on veteran scouts and the establishment as rooted in the dark ages wedded to approaches that just don't work. All of this makes for a terrific sports debate and a very interesting book (Moneyball).As a movie made for entertainment, however, it didn't really deliver more than some ironic humor here and there. Pitt played Bean as aloof and emotionally vapid even while talking passionately about his theories. That was a subtext to the entire movie as we spend a lot of time watching Pitt in his car keeping his family and colleagues at a distance with his Bluetooth. That may be accurate - one of the subtexts seemed to be that while Beane helped bring baseball thinking into a new era while overcoming obstacles, his own life remained rather inconsequential. His history-achieving 20th straight win which consumes about 5 minutes of film is immediately written off by Bean himself in 20 seconds. Again, probably an interesting observation and quite possibly true, but not very entertaining or rewarding.The scenes between him and his guitar-playing daughter (or mostly her voice) are monotonic and just seem to be their to contribute to the subtext of his personal loneliness. Yawn! The scene where he discusses the daughter with his ex-wife (Robin Wright in a static performance that is little more than a cameo) and her new husband is even more clichéd and vapid. Phillip Seymour Hoffman who can be remarkably good in some roles (Capote, Charlie Wilson's War, Almost Famous) and remarkably bad in others (Punch-Drunk Love, State & Main) is neither here. He portrays Art Howe through Beane's eyes as a traditional chew-spitting, hard-headed, fundamentals-preaching manager. Hoffman's portrayal is more than adequate for a clichéd character that contributes nothing of substance to the movie. Thank goodness for Joanh Hill (who I frankly haven't liked in the other two kid-oriented movies I saw him in). Although the name of his character has been changed from real life, he lets us into his thoughts, feelings, and cares about his relationships. In this movie, that was a much-needed breath of fresh air.If you are interested in the concepts of Moneyball, read the book first, then see this on basic cable or on Netflix (there's nothing special the big screen brings to this one).

A Hard-Hitting Sport Film,"""Moneyball"" is a sports film that revolves around the efforts of Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane, portrayed by Brad Pitt. Beane attempts to build a competitive baseball team while working with a tight budget. He employs innovative methods to acquire new players. Now, after this brief introduction, ""Moneyball"" firmly falls into the 'Sports' genre, a genre well-known for its predictable narrative arc. In such stories, underdog teams must struggle relentlessly to achieve what nobody believes they can. This formula has a long history of success because everyone enjoys a compelling comeback story from time to time.The film shines primarily due to its exceptional ensemble cast, featuring outstanding performances by Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill, and the legendary Philip Seymour Hoffman. They are the driving force behind this film, making it worth a watch.""Moneyball"" is a deliberately paced and grounded film. It maintains a clear sense of identity, avoiding the grandiose moments that some might expect. It stands as a well-acted film with an ideal pace and tone, emphasizing its strengths while leaving behind the repetitive elements often associated with the 'Sports' genre.",,Anonymous,Biography
Nearly out the park!,"Baseball team with no money, comes good due to their method, personalities and winning spirit. It's a sporting underdog tail, with a good dose of testosterone, a soupçon of feel-good and a sprinkle of schmaltz. Almost bereft of woman! Although a nice bit of father daughter-ness to add humanity.Brad Pitt and Jonas Hill are both very good. Brad one of his better performances and far to manly than should be allowed.This is no earth shattering experience, but I enjoyed it very much. It's the sort of film that floats my boat, or maybe ""hits my ball""!Worthy watch. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
About the evolution of a sport,"Brad Pitt plays Billy Beane in this sports drama based on real events. Beane is the general manager of the Oakland Athletics baseball team. After yet another less than stellar season he's left with a disassembled team, all of his best players and upcoming hopes being snatched by other teams with deeper coffers. But what if he could find players that would play above expectations. Hidden gems. But for that you'd have to revolutionize the whole scouting process. You'd have to turn to computers.The film sounds surprisingly dull on paper, but the film makers manage to pull off some credible drama out of the whole affair. And that's largely thanks to the cast. This film has some really talented people working for it. Jonah Hill as the analyst who introduces Beane to the whole idea of using computers in the first place. Philip Seymour Hoffman as the team's manager. Chris Pratt as Scott Hatteberg, one of the hidden gems found using the method. But none of them hold a candle to Brad Pitt, whose quietly intense performance and love for his craft shines through in every scene he's in.That being said, it is based on real events, which in this case means that they have to stick to what actually happened. Which means that the overall story arc takes a sudden nose dive near the end. They try to offset this by focusing on other triumphs, but the fact still remains that real life rarely allows for those smooth, neat endings. For some viewers that's a strength. For me, personally, it's a bit disappointing.Still, Moneyball is about as slick of a sports drama as I've ever seen. Professional, competent, but with a hidden passion lurking beneath.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Statistics vs intuition,Very nice movie how statistics actually define the things which we are unable to percieve. Jonah hill and Brad pitt are brilliant in their roles. The movie goes a slow in the middle. The music is good. We have to change things in the way we dont like to achieve the best. If you want good things you have to say goodbye to somethings. How a decision can change our lives.,8.0,Anonymous,Biography
For those who have a love of the game,"Moneyball covers the real life story of Oakland A's manager Billy Beane and his implementation of the then controversial sabermetrics to the game of baseball during the 2002 MLB season to stay competitive after losing key players and being given no budget to court new ones. Like all dramatized adaptions of real life stories, there are inaccuracies, but for the most part, they don't detract from the story. The dialogue and acting are phenomenal with humor that often lands. The minimal soundtrack is memorable and the sound design itself is strong. It's not without flaws, mainly the story jump cutting a little too much and flash back sequences to Billy's time as a player not greatly implemented. Still, these flaws are for the most part, minor and should not steer one away from what is a solid sports history movie.The plot of Moneyball opens with the Oakland A's 2001 loss and general manager as well as former ball player Billy Beane left to pick up the pieces. With no budget and the star players being bought out, Billy begins the arduous process of trying to replace them. When coming to discuss trades with another team, he happens upon Peter Brand who is standing in for the real life counterpart Paul DePodesta. Peter introduces Billy to the sabermetrics approach to scouting and the film follows these two as they work against public opinion, coaches, scouts, and pretty much everyone to build a World Series team all while Billy balances a relationship with his daughter as she grows more concerned for his job.The casting, acting, and dialogue are the strong points of the film, which is good because that's where it focuses generally. Most of the dialogue sounds almost improvised which carries a realism to it. Not only that, it often had me laughing. Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill play near polar opposites and bounce off each other well. Scenes breath and sometimes, they have no dialogue at all, allowing the viewer to reflect. The plot is tight, though this is expected given that it's built off real events. Some may take issue with the inaccuracies to real life, but they didn't bother me personally. The real issues with it come in the form of it jumping rather than transitioning smoothly between scenes. Billy's flash backs to playing in the majors aren't always immediately clear either because of the jump cuts. Still, these gripes aren't enough to dampen my enjoyment.Sound is excellent. The music is memorable without ever being explosively bombastic. I especially love the closing scene choice of 'the show' and how it's used. The sound design itself is more than satisfying. I think I could listen to baseballs cracking off bats all day in this movie.My end conclusion is Moneyball is a solid entry into the long standing history of Hollywood baseball movies. It's historically fascinating and you don't have to be an aficionado to understand what is going on. While it does have trouble with transitions and jump cuts, this should not be enough to detract from a great movie, especially those who have a love of the game.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Moneymovie,"The book was excellently written, suspenseful, and delightfully detailed. The movie script was almost nonexistent. The movie was minimalist: almost no script, often no sound, inexplicably dark lighting, little character development, no actual acting by the main characters, and almost no plot. I cannot understand how someone who has not read the book could stay with this film beyond the first third...or how someone who has read the book could forget the rich material it offered which the film ignores. This film spends money, 50 million, and possibly may make money, but its money-venture nature is almost the only way it connects with its source. The book was filled with characters and explored the inspirations and motivations of life; it illuminated an institution -- the film was devoid of characters and character development, explored nothing comprehensible or important, and illuminated nothing. It signified nothing and didn't even have sound or fury. What a missed opportunity.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
Examining the Economics Driven By Behavioral Choices,"Imagine an employment system that is solely relied on a computer-generated analysis system. ""Moneyball"", directed by the famous actor, Brad Pitt, is a movie that discovers a unique economic theory based on baseball players' competency. The film, synthesized with actors, intricate scenes, and humor definitely make it worth watching (possibly several times), especially knowing the fact that the movie was drafted from a book based on a true story.The Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane is faced with a conflict: after the top three baseball players on the Oakland A's leave, he must form a new group of people that can substitute their professionalism. The tight budget of the team leaves Beane with no choice but to come up with a solution to work around the finance issue, hence the creation of the Moneyball thesis: a statistical analysis that allows small-market teams to compete by buying assets that are undervalued by other teams and selling the ones that are overvalued by the other teams.What impacts can we see today after the creation of the Moneyball theory? The foremost point is that this economic theory formed by has created major political changes. According to Vice Sports, the book (Moneyball) revolutionized baseball, and eventually, every team in the majors adopted some or all of the concepts outlined by Michael Lewis (the author of the book). By the end of the decade, the term ""Moneyball"" was used to describe a statistical based approach (the economic view) in almost all of sports.Some people criticize about the central misconception about it. For example, ESPNs Matt Bryant explains that, ""The Moneyball concept, recognizing the most valuable but least expensive commodities in player evaluation, was immediately transformed in public perception into an obsession with on-base percentage. Therefore, a team that values on-base percentage is considered to espouse ""Moneyball principles"", even though, as Beane points out, players with high on-base percentages have become extremely expensive.""Despite the criticisms about the misconception of what the Moneyball theory has brought, If not for the low finance condition laid upon Billy Beane, the creation of such widely pronounced theory would have not been constructed.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
I don't watch baseball,"Coming from a non-American, I watched this movie expecting that I wouldn't be able to understand any of it. While that was half true, that fact didn't bother me as much as it should have. Not every day do you watch a movie and don't understand the very thing the movie is about but still won't be bored by it. The acting was great, Brad Pitt especially. I am yet to see a bad performance from him. I can see why Americans love this sport. There is so much to it, and I felt kind of bad that I couldn't relate. Not just a game of numbers but a game of people too; traditionalists who won't accept the changing nature of the sport and one man trying to prove them wrong against all odds.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Probably helps if you like baseball.,"If you don't like baseball, it may be a tough slog to sit through. Once the basic concept is set, most of the scenes tend to go through the same sequence for the most part; guy with unique idea for baseball trading is met with doubts yet his methods succeed.That's pretty much what you get for the rest of the film. If you don't like baseball, you're pretty much faced with cardboard cutout character talking about trading baseball players. That's really about it. I can't say there is much depth explored in the characters, most of it is talking about trading baseball players. Easily one of my least favorite Brad Pitt movies.

How can you not be romantic about baseball?,"I do love baseball, but with Aaron Sorkin involved in this movie I would have watched this one anyway. With Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill, Robin Wright, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Chris Pratt the film is filled with star power. I'm a fan of this book and was wondering how they would make it interesting, but they pulled it off in a better way than I expected. They told the story from the perspective of the front office, but also the players with untapped potential who were given a second chance because of this new way of seeing value in those who are a little bit different. Seeing how this approach led to both successes and failures is a testament to movements of all kinds and how it often takes extreme courage and confidence to stand alone for something that you believe in. At times Brad Pitt goes comically far in this respect and it feels a bit overdone, but the point was made. I particular like the scene where they were orchestrating the 3-way deal for Riccione, it was a highlight for me. From the Bad News Bears feel of Spring Training all the way through the winning streak you felt the emotion right along with Beane as he thinks back to his own career, battling some of his own personal demons as he struggles to make this magical season mean something. I really enjoyed how they used real footage and gave Bill James the shout out he deserved late in the film. Like my favorite quote from the film says, the first guy through the wall always gets bloody. This is one I'd watch over and over again.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the Best Sports Films of All Time,"Moneyball is my personal favorite sports movie. It has a great cast, an interesting way of telling things, and shows you the progression of a character, who finds a new way to deal with the problem and mostly succeeds. Most sports movies already did that but this one takes that to another level. Rocky seems a little bland comparing to this. It manages to mix the things that would feel like a joke to mix, economics and baseball, and make it an exciting and powerful project. This film got nominated for 6 Oscars and didn't win any which seems a little funny. The acting in this film is great while you have standout performances with Brad Pitt and especially Jonah Hill. Robin Wright and Philip Seymour Hoffman also have parts and the best part for me was a really young Chris Pratt. This is also an underdog story but it takes it into the next level. There are also some moments where you want to scream and route for the team, these really powerful moments which you are never going to forget about this film. It's also a film which focuses more about the characters which I like. This film is a great character study and another great sports film to add to the collection. A 10/10 in It's genre and a 9.5/10 overall.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
It is not a baseball movie,"If you want a sports true story like ""The Fighter"" or a sports themed movie like ""Win Win or ""Million Dollar Baby"" that is not what this movie is. This movie seemed like a documentary about statistics. I thought Brad Pitt did a great job. But the telling of the story seemed so flat. It had a very depressing feel, from the scenery to the interaction between characters. I love true stories and biographies though this may have been very accurate, I just felt very down throughout the movie; but I was not moved.

With his limited screen time (and word count) he is able to portray the powerful emotions that his character experiences with complete ease. He says more to the viewer in the moments that he isn't talking than when he is. A highly underrated performance and definitely the standout actor of this movie for me.Top marks all round however, and worth a watch even if you aren't a fan of the sport.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Thinking Man's Game,"As a big baseball fan and someone who read the book of the same title, I was anxious to see this movie. Usually, in a case like that I get disappointed because my expectations are too high. Such was the case here, although I did enjoy the film. Not me wrong; it held my interest, but it was no match for the book.Brad Pitt was great as ""Billy Beane,"" as was Jonah Hill as ""Peter Brand."" It was kinda of shocking to see Phillip Seymour Hoffman playing manager ""Art Howe,"" but he was good, too, as were many of the actors who played the pro scouts.The movie is mostly dialog, so the more you like baseball and its strategies and mental aspects, know what they're talking about (i.e. ""on base percentage"") the better you'll like it because it's a fairly long film to sit through. On the other hand, if you don't know a lot about baseball, you can still enjoy the great acting and dialog in here.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
David and Goliath,"Do you have to like Baseball to enjoy this Movie?, you ask. Well, sort of but not really. It is a David and Goliath Story at Heart. Some claimed that the Statistical Emphasis that was put on the Game with Spreadsheets and Algorithms removed the Heart and Transplanted another Head.But, the Truth of the matter is that Baseball and most Pro Sports have been doing that in varying degrees ever since Yankee Manager Casey Stengel invented the Platoon System and Baseball Managers started bringing in Relief Pitchers to go Righty against Lefty and vice versa. In the NFL, Dallas Cowboys' Coach Tom Landry was Famous for his Stat Sheets, and so forth.So really nothing new, just MORE emphasis on Stats and a redefining of a Players Worth versus His Salary is what Moneyball, the System, the Book, and the Movie lays out for us to take or leave as a Viable Visionary Format to Embrace Wholeheartedly. Funny thing is, the Jury is still out.But in a sense it doesn't really matter anymore, because the Money Teams, now Privy to the Method have the Resources to use it and still Buy Whomever they please. As a Movie this Dry Number Crunching may have Limitations as Entertainment, but that didn't stop Wall Street (1987) and while in a Sports Movie, it does manage to be a bit Wonky but still Entertaining.There is much Back and Forth about Romanticizing the Game, and Winning doesn't matter, unless You Win the Last Game and so forth, and it all gets a bit Ambiguous. The Movie's Drawing Strength is the Appeal of ""The Little Guy"". The always present Yankee Haters can attest that Rooting for the Underdog is an American Pastime.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good but very cerebral,"I have heard it said that the most nerdy sport of all is baseball. I believe that to be true. If a math major is going to be interested in a game, the usual choice is baseball.It is a statistician's delight. Hockey (by comparison) has only a few well known stats and few are published routinely. Hockey might be more exciting to watch, but baseball is a much tenser spectator experience. Will the pitcher out maneuver the batter or will the batter dominate the pitcher? The question hangs in the air as the pitcher absent mindedly scuffs the rubber on the mound and the batter takes a practice swing and sets his stance. Who wins, what are the odds, what history do these two have, how hot is the day, which way is the wind going, who's in a slump, who's not, who can throw nothing but blinding fastballs, who has a slider that looks like it can be hit into the parking lot of Yankee stadium until it winds up in the catcher's mitt? And as the seconds drag on, all these questions are discussed between people who may never meet again.But these statistics are kindergarten level questions when Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) opens up his computer and starts really classifying data, using factorials, permutations, combinations and z scores and goodness knows what other statistical mysteries known only to the nerdiest of nerds.Peter is the obvious genius, but there is someone else in the movie who is unusual. His skill certainly ranks above talent. He is driven primarily, it seems, by working a new angle in Baseball, an angle that he himself has no idea where to begin looking. Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) knows the answer is somewhere, but he does not know where. There has to be some way to replace the individual ""hero"" of baseball. If you loose someone like (say) Mickey Mantle in your line up, do you look for another Mantle or do you seek a collection of players that individually come no where near Mantle's skill and ability but as a collection of players who can add up to Mantle? Do you go for the individual or the group? Prior to Beane the answer was the Yankee model. You go for a Dimaggio to replace Ruth and Gehrig and a Mantle for a Dimaggio.Beane changed all that when he looked for a group that could somehow work together and together do what looked like it was an impossibility: put together a winning team that was made entirely of average (affordable) players that collectively could deliver an amazing result, an unexpected one, one that would grab the imagination of a fan base that could not believe the results until records that had stood for years were broken. Day after day the fans were treated to a lengthening of the consecutive wins record. It gave them heart and it gave them courage.The movie does the same thing. It is all metaphor for collective cooperation rather than individual heroics. We see a man who recognized the gift of someone else and was not at all threatened by it. The two central characters work with each other, each understanding what the other knew and each deeply respecting it.I took off 2 points for the music at the end. I cannot imagine why the director used it. Nothing justifies it.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
See? Statistics Can Be Fun,"Aaron Sorkin appears to be the go-to guy for making movies that should be dull as dirt instead wildly entertaining.Last year, he made me hang on every word of the jibber jabber Internet geek speak of ""The Social Network."" This year, he takes on -- are you ready? -- predictive analytics as applied to baseball and has contributed to one of the best movies of the year.Of course, Sorkin did not do it alone. Co-written by Stephen Zaillian, directed by Bennett Miller (of ""Capote"" fame) and starring a never-better Brad Pitt, ""Moneyball"" is a poster child for a the kind of spare, dramatically streamlined and engrossing film that comes along all too infrequently. Telling the story of Billy Beane, general manager of the beleaguered Oakland A's baseball team, who revolutionized the way baseball players are drafted when a data whiz kid (played by Jonah Hill) makes him understand the role statistics can play in picking the best players, ""Moneyball"" is probably more entertaining to people who like baseball, but a love of the sport isn't a requirement in warming to the film. It's just good, plain and simple, and anyone who likes a well-told story should find much to like here.The cast also includes Philip Seymour Hoffman, as the team's pig-headed coach, and Robin Wright (who popped up all over the place this year) as Pitt's ex-wife.Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
The most boring film I've seen in ages,"I decided to watch this film because it had good reviews. I admit that I don't know anything about or have any interest in baseball, however I have watched and enjoyed other similar films with a sports theme before so I wasn't too put off. Unfortunately I think watching nearly ANYTHING else would have been better than sitting through this film. I can only describe the whole thing as bland. Bland characters, bland visuals, bland dialogue, bland music. In fact there was virtually no music accompanying the film, which I think is one of the big reasons it feels so flat. In fact, large (and I mean huge) swaths of the movie are carried out in complete silence. Everybody talks slowly and in a monotone. The sets are dull and grey. I felt nothing for the characters and was drifting off to sleep less than half way through the film. Maybe if you are an avid baseball fan you will enjoy this movie? Otherwise I honestly can't see why anyone would sit through it. Avoid!",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Entertaining film, though it does dodge some issues...","Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill make for a very entertaining, likable dynamic duo, and the character actors they've chosen to fill out the rest of the cast all work great together with the leads.I question the authenticity of everything that is put on display here, but i do have to admit that this makes for a very entertaining ""what if?"" look into the world of a General Manager. Are they this impulsive? Are they truly more critical to the operation of a team then a manager is? This film paints the Manager as being a rather useless facade of a position.I do find it a bit glaring that they don't even mention the fact that the A's had a three-headed monster of Tim Hudson-Barry Zito-Mark Mulder that was unarguably the most dominant pitching trio of that era.With pitching in baseball, your team ALWAYS has a chance. This movie tries to paint the picture that Oakland didn't stand a prayer after losing Damon, Giambi and Isringhausen. With that pitching trio, they were always in competition.Also, dodging the Steroid issue and it's importance to Beane's MONEYBALL theoretics is a bit disingenuous.Still, it is a very entertaining film.

But what if you don't like baseball films?!,"I would sure think that ""Moneyball"" would have a very limited international appeal--especially in countries where they don't have professional baseball. And, even in the States, I can't see this as being an easy sell if the audience member is not a fan of the sport. While I have enjoyed some ball films, I am not a huge fan of pro sports--so keep this in mind when I say how underwhelmed I was by the whole thing. Much of this also is because the film has been nominated for six Academy Awards--one for Best Picture, one for Best Actor and one for Best Supporting Actor. So, I expected a lot and the film seemed to deliver less.This film is based on the real life general manager of the Oakland A's back in the early 2000s. He came up with a statistical system by which he was able to replace big-money free agents with lesser players and STILL win--all by applying a lot of statistical analyses. For fans of fantasy baseball, this will be of some interest. As for me, I just didn't care--mostly because with the huge salaries, teams that move at the drop of a hat and various scandals, pro sports lost me as a fan long ago--and I just didn't care who won or lost. Now IF Brad Pitt's character had seemed like a particularly compelling person, I might have cared...but he didn't.Overall, unless you are a big sports film fan, don't see the film or at least significantly lower your expectations. Pitt's and Jonah Hill's performances weren't bad...but both have done better work.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
I usually don't rewatch movies,"I've watched this movie 3 times. It's just such a quality product. I don't understand or watch baseball. I just like the whole concept of using stats to cheat the system and this movie presents the idea very well and even pulls in the human element to tie it all together. Brad Pitt is spectacular in his role. He oozes of charisma and makes all scenes work. You want to follow all his movements and decisions. And you can see how much he enjoys the role which makes it so much better. He's constantly smiling in his scenes. Jonah Hill is even better! He's acting naturally never looking out of place. He doesn't have the same charisma, but his role is to be the realistic guy.It's just a great movie all around. There are no great faults here and it's a great watch for all. I do have some issues with it of course. These issues make it a bit below an all time great I think, maybe. Firstly the pacing is a tad slow. Just a bit undermanaged. We have a lot of slow-motion baseball scenes. I'm not a fan of overuse of slow-motion and here the scenes are in an already pretty slow movie. It's a weird editing choice. There are also a lot of car scenes and just scenes of Brad Pitt sitting around. A great editor would have only shown live baseball with a commentator and then done more with the car scenes. You could easily film the car driving in interesting locations and make the slow scenes look better. The camera work was pretty lazy at times. It's good, but you often just have lazy stable shots or shots of Brad Pitt's face lingering a few seconds too long. It adds up and at the end you feel like the movie could have told more or been prettier. The roads and baseball park is all realistic, but none of it is that interesting or cool. The ending is also a tad sad which makes it feel like a drama and not a sport movie. But that's because Beane, Brad Pitt, is a sad character in some ways. I just wish it was a bit more upbeat when the team is winning, but it is not.Both the book and movie is great. You can't really pick one over the other that easily. But it's way harder to make a good movie than write a good book as a single amazing author can write a great book, while a great movie takes a team of 100 amazing people. So I pick the movie. It's one of the greatest sport movies ever made and it feels like more than just a baseball movie made for fans - because it is. It's truly its own thing and never tries to rush or entertain with anything flashy or big. It's a drama with a lot of stats and human interactions. It's basically a documentary-like movie. I personally enjoy it a lot. In many scenes you feel like you are just watching guys hang out doing not much at all which adds to the setting. But again, it's done a tad too much at times.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Watch it even if you are not a baseball fan,"I hesitated for weeks before deciding to catch the movie. I am neither a no fanatic Brad Pitt fan nor had no interest in baseball. Thus the movie ranked low on my list of movies to watch. However after reading consistent good reviews on the movie, I decided that give it a try. I did not regret it.Brad Pitt was at his charismatic self. Watching him alone was worth the admission ticket. One of my favorite quote of the movie, ""I hate losing more than I love winning, and there's a difference!""This movie mixed intelligent conversations, flowing pace and excellent cinematography together. It makes this movie a home run. I think suffice to say, as a non baseball fan, it is one of the best movie I have watched.

Good Movie,"""MoneyBall"" is drama/comedy directed by Bennett Miller. True story based on Michael Lewis's book, Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game. The director has done a good job combining a smart script with humor. Brad Pitt was a perfect pick for the role his dry humor adds a lot to the movie. I'm not a baseball fan and you don't have to be a fanatic to enjoy this film.Bennett Miller kept his docudrama style adding comedy to keep it fun and interesting for all the different types of audiences. he's a great director, has shot numerous documentaries. He's best known for his biographical film ""Capote"" about Truman Capote released in 2005.I wasn't very excited about this movie after watching the trailers; it seemed to be like any other sports drama where everybody wins and has a happy ending, but ended up been better than what I expected. I gave this film its fair chance to impress me and it definitely did. I recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Baseball? Don't even think about it. It's a great insider's view with human drama.,"Moneyball (2011)An extremely competent film, with sharp writing and editing, convincing acting, and a great basic story.That's hardly the words you would use for a great classic like ""Citizen Kane"" or even ""Fight Club."" Like that Facebook movie ""Social Network,"" you have here a gripping series of events with a hero and a huge opportunity and the movie makes it pop and crackle--even though on the surface it seems like it couldn't possibly be exciting. I mean, lots of board room or back room conversations, lots of brooding about the future. There isn't even a noticeable romantic line to add that personal layer.All of this attests to the raw ability of the movie makers, mostly the director and writer.The director is who, Bennett Miller? A relative outsider with two other movies to his name, I think people are starting to perk up to him. His first movie, ""The Cruise,"" few people have seen, but it shows his hand in its attraction to a true situation with insight into contemporary American culture. (It's free on Netflix right now, if you are open to a kind of straight up black and white documentary.) His second movie, ""Capote,"" takes us into heartland America and shows he can command a more complicated scenario, some high end acting talent, and edgy crime stuff already part of literary lore and make a compelling sometimes brilliant movie. (Part of the brilliance belongs to Philip Seymour Hoffman, frankly, but the movie is handled with unusual intelligence overall.)So now ""Moneyball"" with Brad Pitt, who anchors it with yet another confident, believable performance from him. The world of professional baseball is automatically interesting to many people. And so is the idea of a lone renegade bucking the system, any system, and succeeding (or almost succeeding, at least). Then there is the astonishing winning streak that builds in the center of the movie with inevitable drama (like the one used by more than one movie when Joe DiMaggio was his streak decades earlier). This is great stuff, and it's hard to go wrong.But Miller goes not merely avoid going wrong. He gives this just enough velocity and just enough breathing room to make it fast and comfortable. You inhabit the movie, you root for the heroes, and you feel the situation more than you thought you could, at least on paper.The other main influence is the writer, or properly writers (two of them), though Steven Zaillian is listed first in the credits. Zaillian has a whole slew of highly regarded films on his resume--Schindler's List, Gangs of New York, the new Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, on and on--and he clearly has given ""Moneyball"" the slick, smart dialog and story line. But the other writer, for the usual reasons, has gotten the bulk of the attention because (I think) he's been recently associated with ""Social Network,"" and that's Aaron Sorkin. (His one other recent credit is the decent Mike Nichols film, ""Charlie Wilson's War."" He mostly known for writing much of ""West Wing,"" which is pure television, even if very good television.)But it boils down to a handful of really talented folk putting together a modestly constructed, very smart and engrossing film about something far more fascinating that you'd have ever dreamed. It won't change your life, but it's a must see kind of movie for a quiet night.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
How does this movie get so many positive reviews?,"I cannot understand, even more i have no clue how this movie gets that kind of positive feedback. To be honest i cant even focus on the movie cuz its insanely monotonous. Neither positive nor negative emotional scenes, nothing hyped, almost nothing is accompanied by music. I lost focus after 70 minutes.Normally i like every lowbudget movie of that kind, because its so easy to reach the feelings of the viewer, its so easy to catch them mostly first in a negative emotional situation and then turn them with the story to a positive one. However Moneyball really had the success to touch not a single emotion of me.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
For the billions who find baseball boring,"For the several billions of people who find baseball the most boring sport in history, this film very cleverly and with grace shows how baseball was made even more boring, using science. Brad Pitt, really, the entire cast is very good, very good. Brad Pitt could do a movie about the making of the first cereal box and it would probably be great. Brad Pitt as the leading character takes us inside the psyche of a very unique manager of corporate assets, which is what a baseball team is at the bottom line. The dedicated dinosaurs he must contend with are expertly played by a great cast, they seem like real sports managers, and perhaps they are. Hoffman does a great job of acting as an immovable object, and he does it with a minimalist approach that is really convincing and artful. In the end the boring sport of baseball plays back field to dreamers pushing at their dream against formidable forces of public opinion, corporate pressure and certain failure. The story transcends the sport of baseball and shows us what might happen when we open up to change and stand our ground. On a good day, Mickey Mantle would have approved, which is probably why the film opens quoting the legendary ball player.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Starts interesting but goes downhill,"This movie started out with an interesting premise where a baseball team was trying a new approach to picking players using advanced statistics instead of intuition of scouts. It was going to show you the war between traditions and new ways of doing business and the first half of the movie was interesting.The movie gets really confusing and fails to explain how the new methodology worked at all though. When they first implement Peter's methodology, they keep losing one game after another. Then suddenly Billy Beane trades 2 players and everything changes 100%, they start going from losing 80% of their games to winning 20 games in a row. No explanation why or how that happened in the movie.Then suddenly they lose the playoffs anyways so it was all for nothing. Still, no explanation how the team went from losing most of its games to winning 20 games in a row and then losing at the first round of play offs. All they did was trade 2 guys in mid-season and Brad Pitt's character gave a couple motivational speeches. Nothing in the movie is really explained in a way that makes sense.Let's be honest here, if this wasn't a Brad Pitt movie, it would have a 5/10 rating at most but people rate it 7.6 just because of Brad Pitt.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
HK Neo Reviews: Moneyball,"Moneyball is just another one of those inspirational sporting flicks, but rather it is a movie about the running of a business in sport, the implications of questioning and doing something against the norm and at its very core a character drama about Billy Beane. In fact the film being adapted by Aaron Sorkin at times felt like The Social Network in the way it analyse the human condition through some smart dialogue and interchange. The casting of Brad Pitt as the complicated, passionate, yet lonely Billy Beane is pitch-perfect. Years ago, Pitt would need been able to pull this off, but he is now a matured and reformed actor and a far cry from his Troy's days. The chemistry between Pitt and the polar opposite in the nerdy Peter Brand (played by Superbad's Jonah Hill) is fascinating and involving to watch. The way the two persist on their vision against the odds is both inspiring and rewarding for the audience. Baseball like most other sports have become part of the money game, therefore it is always refreshing to see the underdogs match it with the big boys. Still, Moneyball isn't just about a small team going on a 20 game winning streak and matching it with the big boys, but about the difficulty to influence change and the hardship involve in going against tradition. Fortune flavours the brave as the saying goes and for Moneyball it very much rings true.All in all, Moneyball is a realistic look at the baseball industry and how it operates and the dynamics that goes on behind the scenes. It may never be an outright successful film, but Moneyball works on all levels and go the extra mile to take the audience along for the ride and eventually winning the audiences' hearts along the way. Great acting, wonderful direction and terrific multi-layer film that ends up working wonders. A film to beat for 2011Neo rates it 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
468th Review: Oscar worthy film about the real sports,"I love inspirational sports movies, who doesn't? But Moneyball is not that kind of movie - Moneyball is about the reality of big money, corporate sport - where millions buy the players - and results mean careers; and what we get is complex, satisfying, and interesting as a result.Moneyball is the true story of the league's ""poorest"" baseball team, with a team roster bill of $37 million, one fifth of the big boys budget. It is also the tale of how the game changed forever through the smarter use of statistics.Shot in a style that is very reminiscent of The Social Network, semi-documentary camera angles (distance on speech for example, which traditional film narratives will cut in close-up, and close-up on non-narrative etc;) , this is smart film- making that doesn't resort to devices to drive it - it is a subtle piece of filming that compliments the story well.Above all though, this is a film of performances, and not just the excellent performance from Pitt, who rewards the viewer willing to try to understand what a General Manager must go through, and his team of coaches and players who really ring true.All in all, this is one of the better films of 2011, it rewards careful, thoughtful watching, and breaks from the Rocky style of sport films that have dominated the genre.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not a typical underdog sports movie,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Moneyball"" (2011) is a true story about how a manager of a baseball team created a winning team from players no one believed in. If that sounds familiar and you know were this is heading for, ""Moneyball"" might actually surprise you because its not a fomuilaic underdog story. It actually tells a story of how that happened from inside of team. And using statistics. And so much more. This is not really inspirational story but rather a one were at the end there are no clear winners. There are just people who are working to survive until another season.Overall, i thing that its the screenplay by Hollywood heavyweighters Steven Zaillian & Aaron Sorkin is a real star of this movie. Actors were also top notch, and directing is a bit hit and miss as well editing. Its not a mainstream underdog inspirational story you can enjoy on Friday evening. Its a different on that and for that i liked this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Well-made, conventional drama","An article on Cracked.com states that we don't know how bicycle work, and that they were first created by trial and error. Nowadays, they say: ""Even modern bike design schools admit that it's not engineering or computer knowledge that make a good bike designer, but instead ""intuition and experience.""Moneyball is about the exact opposite of that.Billy Beane is the GM of the poorest team in baseball, the Oakland A's in 2002. With Peter Brand, an Economics graduate from Yale, they devise a new way of making a team- not with scouts, but numbers and formulas. The story is fairly plain, and the ending isn't what I expected (don't know my baseball history)- for the worse, but for 2 hours Moneyball is an enjoyable film with a great main character, witty writing, and generally the qualities of a good film.This is not a dramatic baseball film, it's a drama film with baseball. I thought I knew how the film would end before I went in, so I thought, ""It's not the what, but the why and how"". However this was not the case. The film didn't end how I thought, and the true story isn't as good as what I thought would happen. The true story is much less inspiring, and the filmmakers tried very hard to make it seem like the A's did change baseball. I don't know if they did, but the facts are more convincing than words.Asides from the plot, the film is about the man who makes it happen. And the man who really makes it happen. Brad Pitt gives an excellent performance as the winning- driven GM. Through a few flashbacks, we see why Beane is so ready to embrace this radical system everyone else sees as crazy. These scenes give him personality and depth. He's the dreamer in a world full of Suits, with one hilarious cameo by Bobby Kotick, archenemy of gamers everywhere.Beane learns of the stat method from Peter Brand, in a dramatic role by Jonah Hill, who more often than not plays the funny guy. It's interesting to see him play a quiet, new-to-business person where everyone makes jokes (some quite funny) while he can only sit and look scared. It would be like if Robert De Niro or Al Pacino were the guys being shaken down by the mobsters.The film is quite funny, but it has to be. It isn't a serious drama, so it goes for the lighthearted approach to avoid being flat. The writing is great, and steers away from the potentially fatal baseball slang/terms. Such gems as ""Yeah, but his girlfriend's a 6..."" and ""This'd better work."" will keep you laughing.So the film is pretty safe, with a strong lead and universal ""think differently/ stick to your guns"" message. Moneyball isn't going to be remembered for its uniqueness or innovation, and in fact unless it wins Oscars it won't be remembered at all. It's a good film, just not special. I only have one complaint, which is his relationship with his daughter is out-of-place in such a work-focused film. Their scenes are silly, with one ridiculous line so close to 9/11. (The movie takes place in 2002.)Moneyball is a well-made and well-acted film that doesn't push any boundaries but plays comfortably within set ones. 8.0/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Not really about sport at all, more a metaphor for life itself.","The Oakland ""A""'s major League baseball team post 2001 season, their General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) is nursing a gut wrenching loss, to the big spending New York Yankees.Realising that he is about to lose several key players, he asks management for more money but the pot is empty. Make do and mend is the advice, albeit pleasantly relayed. Baseball, like most pro-sports is all about money, if you have more, you can buy the better players, win more games, attract more fans, sponsorship and so on and so forth.However, if you don't have much money to spend, your options narrow quickly.On a regular trip to the Cleveland Indians to trade players, Beane notices a youngster who appears to be dispensing wisdom but clearly is not cut from the same cloth as the usual talent scouts. Most of whom appear to pick players based on a random and highly subjective criteria, including if their girlfriends are pretty.Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), is a Yale educated Economics graduate who has developed and refined ideas put forward by Bill James and Craig Wright. Rather than looking at star power, players are evaluated on OBP (On Base Percentage) and Slugging Percentage. Because other teams are not utilising such a method, there were many ""diamond in the rough"" players that could be recruited cheaply. These players would theoretically play well, if assembled carefully in a team with the other required attributes.A team built by a computer based on statistics if you will.Testing Brand out by asking whether Beane himself would have been picked in the draft when younger, the honest response confirms the hire of the young man with the radical ideas.Understandably this new approach does not endear Beane to the existing talent scouts. Initially, the theory is stretched to breaking point as the team fares badly. Will Management keep the faith and will Beane have the strength to see his vision out and change Baseball for ever? Time will tell and none of the above are spoilers, this is a fact based film and all of the information, results etc are well known to any fan with even a passing interest in the subject.If the story sounds a bit dry, well known screenwriters Stephen Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin have managed to craft an exciting, engaging and ultimately very human tale. The story has plenty of great scenes, an Oscar nominated performance from Pitt, coupled with excellent and extensive period detail, assisted and aided by direct help from the Professional Baseball tour.Pitt is not alone, he has sterling support from Philip Seymour Hoffman as the Oakland's long suffering coach, Robin Wright as his ex-wife and Jonah Hill who surprises, with a Oscar worthy nuanced performance.The story flows very well and we experience the highs and lows that only professional sport can demonstrate so well. The scene where Brand is taught how to provide bad news feels realistic, as is the players response to the news. There is enough humour to lighten the mood and certainly knowledge of baseball is really not required.Beane's relationship with his daughter and ex-wife are also realistically sketched. The whole enterprise by Director Bennett Miller has been handled with love and care, in keeping with a sport that still manages to maintain a romanticized place in the hearts of many.The film uses real locations where possible, dressed to resemble the correct time period. The dressing rooms are sets but are meticulously created to replicate the facilities, uniforms and equipment of the time.The film credits list extensive ""effects"" which are hard to spot, as the real and archival action are merged seamlessly, to create a very believable period set whole.SummaryAn excellent sports film which like the best in the genre is not really about sport at all, merely using the structure as a metaphor for life itself.All round excellent performances, led by an exceptionally naturalistic performance from Pitt who has arguably never been better.http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Was skeptical about this movie but was pleasantly surprised.,"Wow this movie is unlike anything I expected. When I saw the trailer and read the plot I figured that it would be another one of those boring old sports movies that the world has too many of.

The movie was very entertaining and kept me rooted to my seat. I think that it had a familiar vibe to the film hoosiers, and a somewhat similar storyline so I guess that this kind of movie has been done before. But it still felt like a totally different film despite the similarities.

Awful,"This should be on the shelves at CVS in the aisle for insomnia remedies. Put it maybe next to the nyquil that makes you drowsy, asbolutely one of the worst movies to be hyped up that I've ever seen.The acting is horrible. Pitt acts like he himself took the drowsy Nyquil medicine in most scenes. The characters all talk to each other like they are tired and falling asleep, in synchronicity with the way the movie is filmed and edited.The baseball game scenes are ridiculous. It looks like scenes of the game of baseball were filmed by someone who didn't know anything about the game, but they tried to capture activities that made it seem like they were experts on it- a pitcher from the catcher's POV, a runner on first base taking a lead, a boring double play fail, etc. In actuality, none of these ""plays"" on the field are of any significance to people who know baseball.By the way, see The Natural or A League of Their Own even to really get a glimpse of what constitutes the important plays and scenes in a game of baseball. It's funny because most people aren't experts on baseball and I could see them watching this movie with the scenes the director filmed thinking that they are ""learning"" something about it or that the scenes matter to the game, when in actuality they are filmed ridiculously and almost pointlessly. Again, I urge anyone to see The Natural or ALOTO to really get a good image of how to capture the game of baseball.I'm afraid this is a movie that was hyped for some reason (Was Weinstein connected to it doing his Oscar campaigning to the Academy or something?) so the audience feels coerced into pretending that they like it because a few critics hyped it and because Pitt and Jonah Hill were in it, maybe the director had a few good prior movies they were fans of. But there is no way people actually organically like this movie other than thinking they should because other people told them to.I've tried to watch this movie about 4 times on cable and it simply cannot hold my attention for more than 2 minutes at a time, it is so bad, so horribly acted, and so awfully filmed. SHelf this on one of the most overrated movies ever made, and put it in the top 10. It's that bad.2/10.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

Top-notch sports drama,"Billy Beane has a problem. As general manager for the cash-strapped Oakland A's, Beane is having a hard time recruiting quality players, mainly because, with the limited budget the owner has given him to work with, he can't possibly compete with the multimillion dollar contracts being proffered by A-tier teams like the Yankees and the Red Sox. To add insult to injury, those teams keep pilfering the few decent players Beane's already got. Into the breach steps Peter Brand, a 23-year-old numbers-cruncher straight out of Yale who's devised a complex algorithm out of players' statistics that will allow recruiters to focus in on the less obviously flashy - and thereby far less expensive - players whom the Big Boy franchises have managed to overlook. The skeptics question the wisdom and efficacy of reducing team-building to mere mathematic formulas and science, but Brand's method winds up working so well that it forever revolutionizes the way major league baseball teams recruit their players.Based on the 2003 book by Michael Lewis, with screenplay by Steve Zaillion and Aaron Sorkin and direction by Bennett Miller, ""Moneyball"" provides a literal inside-baseball glimpse into the inside of baseball. In many ways, ""Moneyball"" is a kind of grownup version of ""The Bad News Bears"" and every other tale of a coach who pulls together a motley crew of misfits and second-stringers and, against all odds, transforms them into a winning team. The difference is that this story has actual history behind it, recounting the 2002 season in which the A's won a record 20 games in a row (yet still lost in the playoffs). Plus, the movie finds its drama more in the behind-the-scenes wrangling among the highly skeptical managers, owners, coaches and staff than in the action on the field (indeed, most of the ballpark scenes appear as grainy clips from actual games). The intelligent screenplay avoids most of the clichés inherent in the genre - and those it doesn't avoid it somehow manages to make seem fresh and vital again. The writing also adds depth and dimension to Beane's character by occasionally flashing back to his own somewhat underwhelming career as a player in the big leagues, showing how that disappointment helped to mold him into the man he is today.Despite the sterling quality of the writing and direction, ""Moneyball"" is clearly an actors' picture, and the filmmakers have recruited a first-rate cast to carry out the drama (I wonder if they used a similar algorithm for that). Brad Pitt has probably never been better than he is here as the Quixotic visionary who's such a bundle of nerves that he can't even bring himself to watch his own games. A mixture of pragmatist and romantic when it comes to the game of baseball, Beane is the perfect person to serve as iconoclast for a game whose roots lie deep in the American psyche but a game that has lost its way in recent times with its huge salaries and uncompetitive money advantages among teams. Jonah Hill is excellent as Brand, as is Philip Seymour Hoffman as Art Howe, the A's highly skeptical and understandably disgruntled manager, who initially balks at what he believes is the disastrous direction in which Beane is taking the team. Chris Pratt (""Everwood,"" ""Parks and Recreation"") and Kerris Dorsey (""Parenthood"") also score in small but important roles.There's drama and suspense aplenty in this film, with literal edge-of-the-seat excitement generated by its re-creation of the nail-biting 20th game that got the A's into the record books. But ""Moneyball"" never overplays its hand, never indulges in corny melodramatics or cheap sentiment to win us over to its side. In fact, it is its very restraint and subtlety - both in performance and execution - that draws us so deeply into the tale it's telling.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
a nice and satisfying watch.,"Watched Moneyball the movie featuring Brad PittIts a movie about a guy who loves a sport, baseball to be precise. and wants to excel at it, or at least something to do with it. It is based on a real life story. Life of Billy Beane, who after few stints of being, highly promising, but unsuccessful player, turned out to be a General Manager of Oakland AthleticsThough it requires you to be abreast with the game of baseball, it history, and other dynamics to be able to enjoy the movie to its fullest, but still without them too, you can get pretty much what the movies is trying to convey. It makes you realize any dream, any philosophy, idea, thought, that you believe in, is worth following to the hilt, and of you do that, others will follow the suit.Though it's easier said than done, as to do so, you need the support system. you need to have emotional backup and also you need to have someone who is there to resurrect your faith when you are just about giving it up.Movie is well packed, with Brad Pitt delivering one heck of a performance ( that's the Yankee way of saying it ..), but I don't know what's with the ""eating/drinking in every scene"", may be its his superstition for a good movie.

Moneyball,"I highly recommend watching the film Moneyball if you enjoy underdog stories with so much more than the typical sport's movie clichés. Moneyball has everything a great movie needs. It keeps you interested the whole time, as you want (rather, need) to find out if Billy Beane's new method to choosing this baseball team will work. The statistics and mathematical side of it all isn't thrown in the audience's face—everything is explained so that the viewer will understand and follow along with each choice made. Peter Brand is a nice comic relief to the stress that Billy Beane is always under—there are even times when Billy Beane is hilarious, as well. Overall, the story is somewhat sad, yet inspirational and enjoyable at the same time. Billy goes through so much to prove that he is good at what he does, likely due to his first-choice career not going exactly as he planned. To watch this team that was ruled irrelevant at the loss of their major players even attempt such a comeback is inspiring. This is not your typical baseball movie—I don't think you even have to be that into baseball to enjoy it as much as a huge fan of the sport would.

It is something that can entertain the most unknowledgeable viewer in terms of baseball.Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill deliver excellent performances and their chemistry really shows throughout the whole film. Brad Pitt especially delivers a convincing performance as Billy Beane. The film approaches sports in an analytic point of view while still showing the baseball being played. The music score will give you goosebumps in some scene and it's a film that I come back to watch time after time. To balance out the drama, there are some comedic moments scattered around in the film.This is one to watch for sure.",,Anonymous,Biography

How can you not feel romantic about baseball?,"Have to say, I really liked this film! Initially I thought this wouldn't interest me since I'm not a baseball fan, but the movie is so well made you don't have to love baseball to appreciate it. The actors make you care about it, the camera pans of the grass and the stadiums are done with such care and reverence, it's hard not to get caught up in the romance of the sports. It reminded me a bit of The Wrestler from a few years back and how that affected a lot of people who didn't really care for wrestling. In a sense, the movie is not really about baseball, it's about rising above and not following the status quo, even when you put yourself at great risk doing so.It was surprisingly very funny and true to the sport. Easily the best role I've seen Jonah Hill in (and yes, better than he was in The Wolf of Wallstreet). He's really solid in his supporting role and almost steals it from Brad. This movie has the best musical score I've heard from 2011 (or at least I can't remember a film that tops it); it's really effective in driving home some of the important parts of the film. And I found it pleasantly ironic that film called Moneyball ends up concluding on the fact that life isn't always about money.I thought Brad Pitt was strong in this film. It was a very subtle performance, but I think he nailed it. As I watched the movie, I really believed he was a beleaguered manager, frustrated with his team's inability to complete with the big market teams; I really can't say that about a lot of his roles. For once, I actually believed he was this character (Billy Beane). His performance might not have been Oscar worthy (as he didn't win and I agree with that), but it was strong nonetheless.One of the more memorable moments of the film is at the end when Billy Beane asks ""How can you not feel romantic about baseball?"".

"Wonderful, Inspiring Movie with great attention to detail","I was very excited to watch this movie and was not let down the slightest bit. From beginning to end, it draws you into the factual story of Billy Beane. Jonah Hill plays a crucial part in the movie and was cast perfectly for this role. After doing a bit of research about Mr. Beane's life, it was interesting to see how close they stayed to the facts. The movie spells out the future of baseball and holds your attention from beginning to end. It's a little over two hours, but Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill keep you occupied the entire time! Generally when a story sticks this much to the facts, it tends to get more boring. I was not a baseball fan the first time I watched this movie, and the story was still written extremely well and delivered perfectly!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Chix Chat on Film review: Moneyball, the mathematics of baseball.","There have been so many films dedicated to Baseball that they are too numerous to count, but this has to be the first that I have ever seen that was based on the mathematics of the game. I tend to get a little bit bored with stories that are based on true events and I did yawn at one point during this film, but overall it was such a fresh take on how desperate times call for desperate measures that I quickly perked up. Watching the on screen wheeling and dealings of Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) as the Oakland A's general manager was very educational if not a bit disconcerting. The players are basically treated like livestock, which just made me a little sad. Jonah Hill (Peter Brand) consistently proves himself as an amazing actor, it doesn't matter if it is comedy, drama or animation he just transforms. I have repeatedly watched Megamind with my grandson recently, so immediately I thought of Metroman and Titan together again! I place this film right up there with the timeless A League of Their Own since it is based on true events. This was one of the best baseball stories that I have seen played out. The human element of this story with the autobiographical content of who Billy Beane is was interesting and entertaining. I couldn't help but to relate to Billy Beane, as I too made a decision based on money and opted to enter the workforce directly out of High School rather than entering college, the decision played out well for him and I have to admit that for me I have no complaints. The relationship with Billy and his daughter Casey (Kerris Dorsey) was so heartwarming that it was obvious what or better yet who motivated his future decisions, but aside from that it seemed that all other elements of his life were centered around baseball, that aspect of his existence I could not relate to at all. I did have a lot of respect for Billy in how he dealt with Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman), I just don't know if I could have been so patient. You cannot institute a paradigm change without having your core team (no pun intended) on-board.I caught this film on the same day that my very own Texas Rangers won the AL West Division, so in my opinion this was an awesome day for baseball, I have to give it a green light. - Emma Dinkins",,Anonymous,Biography
Dull dull dull,Never a fan of Brad Pitt as I find him so dull as an actor as well as a person. This was no different. Watched it because I love sports movies. Triumph over adversity.

Homerun Of A Movie,"The often iterated maxim the a great movie transcends genre or subject can only be restated and proven yet again with Moneyball. If your a fan of baseball, then you might appreciate the service it gives Beane and the sport, if your not already it will probably give you some. Every scene is tuat with drama and smoothly collected into one compelling motion picture. Right at the forefront with Brad Pitt (who could have earned a Best Actor here) are the film's cowriters Steve Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin; who's collaboration proves to be a dream team of sorts. Kudos can also be given to the supporting crew Jonah Hill and Philip Seymour Hoffman and of course the unduely obscure Bennet Miller.Pretty much every moment hits right and its difficult finding a flaw in it. Twelve years later and Moneyball stands as one of the best films of the decade.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent sports movie,"I've seen a game of baseball at the Yankee Stadium. I do not understand the scoring and so I have no idea how it came to be that the Yankees won the game.Notwithstanding my limited knowledge of the sport I really enjoyed this movie. The performances of Hill and Hoffman are far and away my favourite performances by those actors. I think Hoffman, for the role he was in, was perhaps a rather quirky piece of casting. But he was perfect.Brad Pitt was also very effective and believable both in his exchanges with colleagues and in the few scenes with family.The film is mainly about taking on the doctrines of the old guard with a new approach to finding wins. But against that backdrop, there are good scenes of humour and humanity.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"""Moneyball"": Great for Baseball and Movie Fans Alike","Rating: 4 out of Fordyce (perfect) By Jim Fordyce AmericanEntertainmentReport.com Sept. 24, 2011 7:31 am EDTChat it up everyone, ""Moneyball"" is a really good movie. Brad Pitt stars as Billy Beane, the general manager of the Oakland A's and the guy who rejects baseball's conventional wisdom after he is forced to rebuild the Athletics on a tight budget. He teams with Ivy League grad Peter Brand, played by Jonah Hill, in an unlikely partnership, recruiting bargain players that make the scouts cringe. We watch as this story takes some predictable and unpredictable turns. Pitt and Hill are both perfect in their roles, as is the amazing Philip Seymour Hoffman in another one of his spot-on character roles as manager Art Howe. The insiders know I am not a big fan of sports movies and usually get offended when people say things like it isn't a sports movie, it is a people movie, a movie with a message, an inspiring tale or some other such cr*p. I won't even buy that this time. It is a sports movie pure and simple, but a great one that tells a well-crafted story based on true incidents. It holds your interest and is well produced. This is also a movie where many of us know how it ends. I remember the A's winning streak in '02 and everything else about that amazing season. In the tradition of ""Apollo 13,"" which is another great movie, in ""Moneyball"" we know the ending, yet the writers, producers and directors keep us right on the edge of our seats. That edge earns ""Moneyball"" a perfect 4 out of Fordyce. Credit Check: Nothing happens after the credits roll.",,Anonymous,Biography
Disappointing from my watchlist,"Here's a simplified version of the review:Moneyball mostly focuses on Brad Pitt's character, Billy Beane, but it doesn't show him doing much of the actual work. Instead, he's often just watching or listening while Jonah Hill's character, Peter Brand, does all the data analysis and number crunching. Pete is the one who figures out the strategy, running the numbers and explaining everything, while Billy just goes along with it.The movie tries to create some drama with the scouts and the team manager, but those conflicts don't really go anywhere and just disappear. It's like the movie sets up problems and then forgets about them.There's also some backstory about Billy's past in baseball and his relationship with his daughter, but these parts feel tacked on and don't add much to the main story. They seem to be there just to make Billy a bit more relatable, but they don't feel necessary.And they didn't win, instead red sox won.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

Moment for forgiveness,"I, of course, have heard of the Moneyball, but never gotten around to watching until now.

La Russa era, then the frustration around year 2000 when Giamb and Damon left, then Hudson, Mulder, Zito, Tejada all left. I couldn't stand the team any more and stopped watching baseball altogether until the Giants' dynasty.

"Inspiring story about courage, innovation and the importance of teamwork","""Moneyball"" is based on a true story and introduces us to the world of baseball. With an intelligent script and outstanding acting, the movie succeeds in inspiring not only sports lovers, but also those interested in strategic decisions and overcoming obstacles.The movie tells the story of Billy Beane, the general manager of the Oakland Athletics, played by Brad Pitt. After his team suffers a series of talent losses, Beane decides to take a new approach to be competitive on a limited budget. This is where the concept of ""Moneyball"" comes into play - analyzing statistics and data analysis to identify undervalued players. The film shows how Beane goes against the conventional approach to baseball and decides to use statistics and data to identify the best players. This innovative approach leads to controversial discussions and challenges traditional notions of the sport. This exciting exploration of different ways of thinking makes the film extremely interesting and inspiring. A successful interplay between sport and strategy.Brad Pitt delivers an excellent acting performance and impressively expresses the contradictions and emotions of the character. He embodies Billy Beane's determination and combative spirit in a way that draws the viewer in. The supporting actors, such as Jonah Hill as Peter Brand, Beane's analytical assistant, also contribute significantly to the success of the film.The staging and direction by Bennett Miller should also be emphasized. With carefully chosen camera angles and restrained but effective staging, both the action on the pitch and the dialog scenes are impressively presented. The movie captivates the audience and lets them experience the passion and excitement of baseball up close.--------------

Try the Social Network.Every time I watch it I enjoy scenes like: ""if we play like the Yankees in here, we will lose to the Yankees out there.""I don't care if Billy said these words or not.

"A Hit, Even With Non Sports Fans","Daniel Menegaz, our 13-year-old film critic loved Moneyball, even though he admits, he's not a big sports fan. Here are his comments:Moneyball is the invigorating true story about the rise of the Oakland A's —a baseball team with a tiny budget. Starring Brad Pitt as Billy Beane and Jonah Hill as Peter Brand, the duo try to re-invent the game of baseball by using a new way of recruiting players. The movie was serious at times, but the comic relief is very funny. I thought it was really clever when they used real footage of baseball games in the film, as well as recreating games. The acting was also spot on. Considering I'm not the biggest baseball fan, this movie was actually really good. It is rated PG- 13 for some profanity but, aside from that, all of the subject matter is appropriate for kids as young as ten. Over all, I would give Moneyball 4 out of 5 stars.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21t_M9IVLYw",,Anonymous,Biography
"Sure it's inspiring to an extent, but it's also heavy-going and dull","Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) is a former baseball player who is now the general manager for the Oakland Athletics. When he is faced with the prospect of losing 3 of his key players, he approaches the 'boss' to try and get more money from him in order to replace these key players. When the 'boss' informs Beane that no more money is available Beane must try to build the best team that he has with the money that he's got; fortunately he is able to recruit stat-man Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) who teaches Beane to look at baseball scouting from a completely different angle...What I know about baseball could be written on the back of a postage stamp and therefore I decided to watch Moneyball hoping that the film would educate me somewhat whilst also providing me with an uplifting story. Whilst it does a little of both, I didn't find Moneyball to be an entirely satisfying product...One thing I did notice about this film is how cold and clinical it feels; for the most part it's quite dour and depressing and at times it plays out more like a cold documentary than an uplifting piece of cinema. This is further extended to the baseball players within the film; there's no backstory to any of them and no real development to them as people which makes it impossible to root or care for any of them - this is made worse by the rather unceremonious way that they are traded to other teams (again made worse by how accepting some of them are of their dismissals which doesn't sit well with the flow of the film given that Beane had to give Brand a pep talk on how to deal with players reaction to being dismissed). Perhaps Director Bennett Miller wanted to keep the film low-key to avoid it being too melodramatic, but there has to be at least a degree of melodrama otherwise the film can come across as being rather flat and unengaging which is what happens in Moneyball. These things do give the film a rather heavy going feel about it which makes it a bit of a mare to sit through.I confess to knowing nothing about Baseball so the various stats talks and tactical discussion went over my head (this may cause a problem to non-Baseball fans who choose to watch this film as it does take up a good chunk of the running time and this aspect of the film may be boring to some people - it certainly was for me). I think what makes things worse is that I didn't feel that the film did much to uplift me; I never felt a sense of euphoria at any point and wasn't cheering the Oakland Athletics on in the way the filmmakers wanted me to - although I'm prepared to acknowledge that what they achieved with the money/resources they had was quite a feat. As mentioned, it is a combination of the flat way the film is presented, the weak characterisation, and it's general failure to truly uplift me that were the biggest factors working against the film (the film even finishes on a slightly negative note when providing its summary at the end).If there are any positives to this film then they lay with the acting; Brad Pitt does really well and is perhaps the only person it is possible to be behind throughout the film; his Billy Beane has the charisma and desire, but his flaws are shown as well which did give me some investment in the film. Jonah Hill is surprisingly low-key, but does well with what he has to work with - my one criticism is that he doesn't develop much of a working chemistry with Pitt which only adds to the multitude of problems I had with this film.Those with an interest in Baseball may get something out of this, but it did little for me I'm afraid.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography

Sets the Oscar bar high.,"The first genuine Oscar contender to land on our screens, this ostensible sports flick has set the bar very high indeed. Based on real events (and adapted from Michael Lewis' book ""Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game"") Moneyball recounts the ground-breaking approach that General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) took to enable the Oakland Athletics, with their $40m payroll, to compete against sides like the Yankees who had $120m behind them. With only a handful of actual baseball scenes featured – mostly from the 20th match in the A's record-breaking 20 game winning streak – director Bennett Miller wisely sticks close to the utterly gripping off-field drama that screenwriters Aaron Sorkin and Steve Zaillian have superbly eked out with their pens. Brad Pitt proves his sense for picking career propelling roles is still flawless; his turn as the arrogant, charming, stubborn and intelligently forward-thinking Beane is a revelation, surely placing him as the early frontrunner for Best Actor come the awards season that's just around the corner. Throw in a well-measured, heartfelt performance from Jonah Hill and you have a film that will undoubtedly be tagged a classic in the not-too-distant future.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The key to small-market success in Baseball,"The team has just lost. They lost their playoff round, they lost their spirits, and, most of all, they've lost their three best players: Jason Giambi, Johnny Damon, and Jason Isringhausen. Thanks to the prevalence of big-budget teams, smaller organizations like the A's are losing all of their best players; one could even go as far as saying that these lesser franchises could be considered farm systems for the big boys in New York or Boston. As is his job, A's GM Billy Beane is faced with filling three roster spots that the lost players once occupied. When he goes in the scouting meeting, all he hears is the same old jargon. Scouts repeat things like ""five-tool player"" and ""a great-looking swing"", which reminds Beane of when he was a hot prospect coming out of high school. Having been the target of these scouts' attention previously, Beane doesn't trust the traditional player evaluation process, and that is where Peter Brand comes in. On a visit to the GM for the Cleveland Indians, Mark Shapiro, Billy fails to find a single trade, and he sees a man whispering advice to Shapiro's assistant. As he leaves through the offices, Billy sees this same man at a cubicle, and he confronts him. The man's name is Peter Brand, and after a few minutes, we learn that Peter is fresh out of Yale with a degree in Economics. This first meeting is where Brand reveals his unique player evaluation system. Just like Beane, Brand sees that the big budget teams are suffering from inflated contracts for some players, and they're severely undervaluing others. Basing his idea off of a groundbreaking book by Bill James, Peter Brand uses a statistical data system that, in theory, will give the A's a chance against the big budget organizations. After ""buying"" Peter from Cleveland, Beane gets set to revitalize Oakland, and immediately he knows that it will be a challenge.My Thoughts In an era where the contracts for major athletic talent are skyrocketing in price, the Oakland A's were one of the first teams to go against the grain, and this film tells their story. The concept of using statistical analysis to judge talent rather than the traditional way was an unpopular idea back a decade or so ago, but nowadays it is a major familiarity. Thanks to the idea, many baseball teams have earned championship hardware, most notably the San Francisco Giants. As I have said before, I am a fully devoted Giants fan, and I can attest to the fact that the concept made famous across the Bay Bridge has found success on this side. GM Brian Sabean utilizes Moneyball's key principles, and in turn has brought a trio of trophies home. The acting performances are very well executed, especially by Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill. Pitt's role as the layered Billy Beane is great for the actor, and he played it perfectly. Pitt captures the troubling past that Beane had as a player, the difficulty as a divorced man with a growing daughter, and the rapid emotions that flow throughout a real-life baseball season. In a rare dramatic role, Jonah Hill is fantastic as the quirky Peter Brand, nailing both the serious and comical scenes throughout the film with relative ease. This film based on our national pastime received quite a lot of recognition from the public, including the Academy. Though it did not win any, Moneyball was nominated for six Oscar categories, most notably Best Picture, Best Actor (Pitt), Best Supporting Actor (Hill), and Adapted Screenplay. I personally believe that Hill's performance and the screenplay were definitely deserving of an award. From the moment that some of you saw the basic storyline of this movie, you might have written it off as a sports movie; however, it is about so much more than just baseball. In this film, the baseball is simply the background setting, and the people behind the scenes are the real focus of the plot. Although quite a bit of the humor is baseball-related, it is still applicable to almost everyone. My one major disclaimer is the infrequent language. It's a PG-13 rated film, and the language is deserving of it. A couple F-words and some smaller curses (sh**, a**, etc.) are uttered, but they're applicable to their situation.This is a fantastic sports-related movie, and I recommend to everyone who even remotely likes either sports or the people behind it.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Like good science (non)fiction to me,"My family is somewhat agnostic about sports, meaning that we believe they exist but are not certain of the where or why of them.

Most movies from books -- at least the ones I have seen -- diverge a lot from the written tale. Not so for Moneyball.

Should not have been made.,"The movie, like so many other things in this world, is about how being in the right place at the right time, if you are lucky and more importantly if someone likes you, well, then you can rise and make gobs and gobs of money being a mediocre entity. In this case, a player that was at the pro level because he is liked and probably, there because the team's were short handed and/or desperate.
So fast forward, this guy is a minority owner and executive for being a double A level, if that, athlete, and in baseball in the 80s, so he was much of an athlete and they make a movie about him and now, this ""former player"" is doing as well if not better than all the star athletes when he played and he was a double A player. Unbelievable.
No championship, ever and again (and this is why the world loves and hates this country) a person, not even at the mid level of playing or managing, but at the low , low levels and should not even have been in the majors makes GREAT.
Again we reward mediocrity and the funny thing is he was below ""mediocrity"" and still sits pretty.
 You got guys like Scotty Bowman and Mario Lemieux and others in all sports at the top, top 2 percent ever, and don't even get a mention much less a movie about them

A pleasant surprise,"I used to love going to the Oakland Coliseum. Maybe it was only in comparison to Candlestick, but the Coliseum was a pleasant place to watch a ballgame. Then the Haas family sold the team, Al Davis moved the Raiders back from L.A., the Coliseum was enclosed and became an airless mausoleum with the ambient of a toiletbowl; since then, I have been to about half a dozen games in Oakland. Since being swept by Detroit in the 2006 ALCS, the A's have been caught up in a swirl of ineptitude. The current ownership, saddled with an inadequate facility and no clear prospect of finding a new home, have (unlike the Giants' management of the '80's, who brilliantly promoted a substandard product) spent the past few years actively discouraging people from supporting the team.Billy Beane is part and parcel of the A's malaise. Beane was a scout's dream, a blue-chip high-school prospect, who was drafted in the first round of the amateur draft by the New York Mets (who used the first pick in the draft on another SoCal high-schooler, Daryl Strawberry); he might have gone higher in the draft, but teams were leery that Beane might accept a baseball/football scholarship to Stanford, where he would have had a chance to succeed John Elway at quarterback. The players chosen around Beane, Terry Francona and John Gibbons, would go on to become successful Major League managers, a class of people for whom Beane reserves his greatest contempt. Beane has increasingly made moves which have left the team in a constant rebuilding cycle, haphazardly dealing game-ready, club-controlled players for prospects, with the glee of a ten year old swapping baseball cards, or my coke-addled former roommate rearranging her bedroom. How acquiring Milton Bradley and Matt Holliday for Andre Ethier and Carlos Gonzalez fits in with the precepts of ""moneyball"" quite escapes me.The scene in this movie which most adequately captures this ""I'm more clever than anyone else"" aspect of Beane is the four-way phone conversation between Beane, Ed Wade, Dave Dombrowski, and Brian Sabean (actually, a five-way conversation, counting hapless owner, Steve Schott, who is left on hold), during which Beane snags Ricardo Rincon. This is a high point. The somewhat more questionable trade which netted the A's Ted Lilly, and for whom they gave up Carlos Pena and Jeremy Bonderman, is glossed over. Brad Pitt does a very commendable job showing both Beane's arrogance, and his insecurities. Jonah Hill is sterling as the Paul DePodesta-based assistant, hiding from the realities of the game behind his glasses and his lap-top. Philip Seymour Hoffman gives a surprisingly nuanced turn as beleaguered and out-of-his-depth manager Art Howe. While looking nothing like Howe, he ably suggests Howe's befuddlement, humor and basic decency. And the narrative peak of the movie, the wildly improbable 20 game winning streak, was very deftly constructed. As a side note, a 20 game winning streak is almost the antithesis of ""moneyball"", and it's strange that it was spearheaded by non-""moneyball"" players such as Miguel Tejada and Eric Chavez, the year after the A's lost the ultimate ""moneyball"" player, Jason Giambi,to the Yankees. Also, hearing the late Bill King's voice over the reconstructed game footage brought tears to my eyes.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of Best Films of Year - Not a baseball movie.,"Moneyball is one of the best films of 2011 - and it is not a baseball movie. Moneyball moves briskly through the story, moving through scenes of humor, frustration, excitement - carrying viewers on the emotional roller coaster of Brad Pitt's character.Baseball is a backdrop not a dominating presence in the film. The interactions between Brad Pitt and the scouts, managers, and players provide some very humorous moments and a few touching scenes. But, they are just a part of the story.Brad Pitt dominates the film with an outstanding performance of a driven man seeking to prove he is the best in the business of baseball. Brad Pitt does a great job capturing the internal conflict, anger, frustration, and ego of a man born to be a baseball star - but who fell short. Brad Pitt deserves Oscar consideration for this performance.The heart of the film is the relationship between the characters played by Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill. Both do a wonderful job in the roles, and they have some great interactions. Jonah did a great job in an understated way. Some of his best moments are quiet reactions to the antics of Brad Pitt's character.I'm not a baseball fan, but I loved the movie and would highly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A sports film for people who do not like sports films,"Moneyball was a successful film with both audiences and critics, working as a strong piece of entertainment for sports fans and non-sports fans alike. Based on a book by journalist Michael Lewis, Moneyball tells the story of the Oakland Athletics, one of the poorest teams in Major League Baseball who have to rebuild after the 2001 season after losing their three best players. General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) has to rebuild with limited resources and he takes a controversial approach when he hires a young Yale economics graduate, Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) to use a statistical approach to find the best undervalued players and create a winning team with the players no one else wants. But the pair are up against a sports establishment within the media and within the team and it seems like a highly risky experiment that could be doomed to failed.Moneyball works as both as sports film of an underdog going against the odds as a small team attempt to become contenders and earn a massive record and as a drama as Beane and Brand attempt to go against the system so they can cause a revolution. For someone who does not know much about baseball it was easy to follow and I could easily make comparisons to Premier League football.For a film about statistics and mathematic calculations it still interesting and direction by Bennett Miller does inject a lot of style when looking at formulas and spreadsheets. Throughout the film it has a similar style and look to The Social Network and can work well as a double bill.There is a find cast, Pitt, Hill and Phillip Seymour Hoffman being the biggest names and the highlights of the film. All of them give strong performances and along with the writing they all felt very real. They did seem to act like real people in their situation and we do get to dig deeper into Beane's character, from his relationship to his daughter and his ex-wife to his past where he was seen as a great prospect and how he is a betrayed by the traditional scouting system.Moneyball was a very well written film, with a great look at its characters and how they acted. It was great looking at the sport for fans whilst allowing non-fans to understand the sport. It feels organic as it processes and does not have the typical ending. Whilst it does seem to have some sports films clichés of the team seeming to be useless and bad and they turn good when they are up against, but in the context of the film it works and it is based on real events. Moneyball twist the conventions of the evil statisticians trying the rip the heart out of sport and instead shows how sport science has changed, whilst still acknowledging the fans and other factors like personal characteristics. This is also a film that looks at the back room staff of a sports club, showing the detail the scenes elements instead of solely looking at the on field activities. Even if you do not like sports films it works as a look at internal politics within an organisation and as a story about defying conventional or outdated thinking.The trailer for Moneyball marketed it as a witty, dialogue driven film in the vain of The Social Network and other Aaron Sorkin projects; but it was more a character driven drama and as a wider story about achieving with the resources you have. There are some fun lines, but on the whole the dialogue is mostly natural and down played.Moneyball is a solid drama and it shows how filmmakers can make a project about a subject they love whilst making it accessible to people who do not know much about Major League Baseball.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Pitt and Hill really make this film.,"Billy Beane(Brad Pitt), manager of the baseball team the Oakland A's, is growing very frustrated, that he get a winning season, his team is the lowest of the low. He tries to figure out what is he doing wrong. Then he meets Peter(Jonah Hill), a college graduate, with a high I.Q., who tells him his approach to the game is all wrong, so Billy hires Peter, decides to takes Peters advice, and go with the new approach, but will it work?Brad Pitt give an Oscar worthy performance, you really feel his frustration. Jonah Hill is good too, nice to see him do something different. He and Pitt have good scenes together. Philip Seymour Hoffman is also good as the coach. The guys playing the baseball players are too. I hope this movie won't be missed by the Oscars.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Billy Beane looks to change the rules of Baseball,"""If you lose the last game of the season, nobody gives a sh*t."" – Billy BeaneThe tried and tested method to creating a winning team in baseball was simple; whoever spent the most would eventually come out on top. This was the pitfall of modern baseball and the inevitable cycle that Billy Beane (Brad Pitt), the General Manager of the Oakland A's found himself in. It was the attempt of Billy Beane to change all of this by creating a team on a computer- generated analysis of stats rather than the players themselves.In essence this is a sports movie, it follows a team through its highs and lows and watches the underdog try to beat the system. These are components of a good sports movie and it is generally conceived that it is the actual sport that creates the feelings of tension. The interesting thing about Moneyball is that it does not follow the players within the sport as much as a regular movie in its genre. The bulk of it follows the back room grind of Billy Beane and Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), the young economist student that brings the new way of player picking to Beane's attention. With a general lack of sport, or sport being the secondary aspect, it may seem that there will be a lack of thrills for its genre. However, this is ultimately not the case, as the boardroom meetings and telephone calls for trades create true excitement.It is a film that looks to break one simple fact, that money is not the only thing that can bring success. It is unchartered territory for Billy Beane who throws all caution to the wind at the start receiving hostility from those around him. A film that centres on numbers and graphs perhaps should not hold such electricity around every decision, but it does. You do not have to follow baseball to understand the goings on, as most is explained clearly and is created through the interaction between Pitt and Hill.There is a lot on the shoulders of Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill to carry this film that, as acknowledged, does not have a huge amount of sport within it. Pitt plays a more brash up front and in charge character that could easily overwhelm the quieter, geekier Hill as Brand. However, as the film develops you begin to see the real relationship between the two, as partners in this audacious attempt to change baseball. The dialogue is written to perfection to keep the action shooting along, even off the diamond of the baseball pitch. Pitt has stuck with the role through several directors (Steven Soderbergh and David Frankel) and is really allowed to shine under the eventual direction of Bennett Miller.The film is gripping to the end as the authenticity of the story holds true over the year that Billy Beane worked on his lean budget in an attempt to show up the world of baseball.4 Stars.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Pretty Good, Works as Comedy","All these years, I've missed out on Moneyball. It just never appealed to me for some reason. Regardless, I caught it for the first time recently on cable, and I must admit that I was impressed with it.There were some minor drawbacks however. At a few moments, it was a little bit too melodramatic, or Pitt was really pushing some lines over the top into cheese at times. It's hard to explain because most of the scenes were not like this and Pitt was good in many scenes, but there were a couple that seemed to not fit or something, let's just for professional terminology refer to it as synchronicity. It took what was a serious subject matter that was working and made it into a little bit of cheese.But these scenes were few and far between. The majority of the movie works, especially as a comedy. I had a few very loud LOLs, surprisingly. Not knowing what I was in for and what the content would be like, I must conclude that I now understand why Moneyball was somewhat well regarded and popular in 2011. It's worth a watch and in this day and age of filmmaking, it made its mark and stood out well enough to e rated above most.7.5/10",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Entertaining, Fun, and Wel-Crafted Sports Film. Makes you love the game even more.","After this year's amazing World Series, baseball fans got another treat with a fantastic film about how the game is played and how it could be managed going forward. Moneyball is a fine film and enjoyable for fans of the game and even casual baseball fans. The somewhat gritty story of a GM, played very cleanly by Brad Pitt, who looks for ways to win without a huge budget, is entertaining and inspiring. I had high expectations for this film and most were exceeded. The script is great and the film features the right balance of humor, drama and real-life action. Two thumbs up for a really entertaining drama that makes you ready for Spring Training to start!",,Anonymous,Biography
Best Written Sports Film,"While Moneyball is by far the most original take on America's favorite pass time, it is not exactly what you would expect from a movie about baseball.Two things Aaron Sorkin knows how to write are controversial figures and excessive amounts of jargon.If you have ever tried playing a video game of baseball with your friends, but then gave up trying to play after you noticed how long they were taking and how excited they were getting to build up an empire in the franchise mode, then you should know exactly what to expect from Moneyball. The language and mathematics of Americas favorite pass time is put before everything including the actual game itself, which is both the solution and problem to the film in general. The writing of the script does not loan itself as much to the game as it does to the politics behind it.Therefore the commitment Sorkin makes to the characters of Brad Pitt as Billy Beane and Jonas Hill as his assistant Peter makes this a lot more of a sports drama than an actual sports movie, which almost makes for poor casting of Phillip Seymour Hoffman as the head coach of the Oakland A's. All Hoffman does as the head coach in Moneyball is pout around the office over every decision Pitt makes, which he does well. But Hoffman could've played anybody else besides the head coach while anybody else, including the actual head coach who was actually considered for the role could've played the head coach because the head coach doesn't really do much in Moneyball.However the story of Moneyball isn't about the head coach of the Oakland Athletics. Moneyball is about the Oakland Athletics Manager Beane and how Beane replaced three key players in his franchise. The kind of pressure that position comes with is a side of the game that fans of baseball do not get to see and either that's entertaining to you or it's not. For me this is probably one of the best written major league baseball movies I've ever seen.Every decision made by Beane is made with an authoritative confidence that is difficult to argue. The only person backing Beane's decisions in Moneyball is the assistant, helping him make them with his thorough evaluation of statistics. These two together are what also makes Moneyball fun to watch for the risk factor involved in every decision they make as a bizarre series of trial and error. With Peter as Beane's assistant and Kerris Dorsey as his daughter, Pitt as Oakland Athletics Manager Beane has more than enough support, on or off of the field.Both of these relationships are what allow us to like Pitt as Beane, an under dog in this game of Moneyball, even though nobody else does. And that seems to be a characteristic trait of Sorkin's hand in script writing so far besides politics.Nobody close to Mark Zuckerberg in The Social Network liked any of the decisions he was making neither. But Zuckerberg's decisions are exactly what gave birth to Facebook while the movie about him written by Sorkin got him nominated for an academy award.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Little Too Dramatic?,"Pros: I'm not going to say that I'm in love with Brad Pitt or anything, but... isn't he dreamy? Sadly, we aren't treated to any shirtless Brad, but he is shown working out a few times and is generally wearing form-fitting shirts. On the flip side, we are also not treated to any shirtless Jonah Hill, so... That's always appreciated. I don't really know anything about Billy Beane, but as far as I can tell, Pitt's character is how I would want Beane to be. He does a quality job of breaking out his dramatic chops of yesteryear while still including some of that boyish goofy charm that he has more recently developed. Speaking of acting, for all of you wondering what Jonah Hill's name is doing among the nominees for best supporting actor, please allay your fears. While I can't speak for every single supporting actor who appeared in a film in 2011, I can say that Hill's dramatic skills are indeed present, and I don't think he is misplaced with his nomination. He portrays the intellectual baseball nerd affably well (I didn't use ""affably"" correctly there, so don't bother looking it up to check me), and the only thing I would have liked more is if the movie had dived more deeply into the new age baseball metrics. But that's probably just the nerd side of me talking; I'm sure I don't speak for everyone.Cons: Does Brad Pitt have a bet with someone about the number of times he can be seen eating on camera? Not just in this movie, but in all of his movies of late. And not just any food, but generally junk food that he's just shoveling into his mouth... Is he trying to brag about his metabolism or something? I don't really get it.What I do get, however, is what a five tool player is. And I understood that after the first time those five tools were listed out. The next couple dozen listings weren't really necessary for me to grasp the concept. I suppose it's the point of the movie that baseball scouts and executives focus on the wrong things, but aren't there any other wrong things for them to focus on, other than fielding, running, throwing, hitting, and/or hitting with power?And while we're at it, let's remember that we're talking about scouts who have been doing this thing for decades, and who have known those same five tools and been making the same assessments about kids for many years. Why do they need to stumble over their words? Shouldn't they know all this by now? I'm assuming there's a desire by some directors of ""true stories"" to have spoken lines be a little more clumsy and sputtered, because, you know, that's how real people talk. This makes me a little torn. Yes, I like realism. But at the same time, I go to the theaters in part to escape reality. If I want to listen to old men stumble over their words while they describe in broad, sweeping statements how good a ballplayer is, I'll go to the Polo Grounds. In the meantime, I'd like to watch these highly skilled actors deliver their lines with a greater degree of comfort (within their roles, of course), while I, as a responsible movie-goer, bear in mind that I am not, in fact, looking through a window on the real world.While I'm not looking through a window at the real world, though, I am looking at a portrayal of it. And in this particular case, I'm looking at a portrayal of a baseball team that has been ""gutted."" Who did they lose again? Oh right, I should remember since they repeated the names Giambi, Damon, and Isringhausen even more often than the five tools mentioned previously. Even with this gutting, the A's still had the best starting rotation in baseball along with one of the elite shortstops in the game. And despite this flash back to reality, the screenwriters and director feel the need to hit you in the face with a dramatic 2x4 when you watch their movie.Overall: That being said, the movie did suck me right in. It was well-made, with good pacing, compelling characters, an interesting enough story, and a thoroughly woven theme. And when some of the dialog wasn't awkwardly stuttered through, it was sharp and entertaining. Oh, did I mention the movie has Brad Pitt? I'm sheepishly giving it an 8 out of 10, while taking a step back to remind myself that I just saw a movie about generally managing a baseball team, not about curing cancer.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Fantastic and Un-Clicheed Sports Film,"I just saw this movie, and I have to say, it's one of the better sports movies that I've seen. It starts off with a brief glimpse at the Oakland A's demise in the 2001 playoffs vs the Yankees, in which they coughed up a 2-0 series lead in the best-of-5 ALDS. Following this heartbreaking defeat, the team is essentially dismantled. They lose their top players (Johnny Damon, Jason Giambi, and Jason Isringhausen), and are forced to rebuild.Like most sports movies, it at least partially focuses on every MLB player's main goal: to win a World Series. But it's also about more than that. In ""The Natural"", it's about an old, injured coulda-been that strives to meet his former potential. In ""Field of Dreams"", it's about the love of the game, and how it unites people. In ""Moneyball"", it's about one man's apparent desire to change the game by looking at nothing but On-Base Percentage. It's also about Beane and Brand's new ideas going up against the purists of baseball.Brad Pitt can add yet another great performance to his resume with his portrayal of Billy Beane, the A's GM. And Jonah Hill proves (to me anyways) that he is an actor capable of much more than raunchy comedies. I didn't once think about his previous characters from Superbad and Knocked Up when I watched him. Philip Seymour Hoffman adds instant class as A's manager Art Howe, as well.The film is also completely devoid of sports clichés. It helps to know that it's all based on true events, I suppose. But you don't feel like you're watching a recycled film. I was captivated from beginning to end.I suppose my one complaint would be the small amount of real-live baseball footage. Most of the baseball is old footage of the actual events, with the actors integrated in for close-ups. But the film is seen from Beane's perspective, and he doesn't like to watch the games.Don't be surprised if it gets some Oscar nods. Possibly Best Adapted Screenplay (from the book), or maybe even Best Actor for Brad Pitt. See it now.",,Anonymous,Biography

'MONEYBALL' is to baseball what 'THE SOCIAL NETWORK' is to social networks.,"'MONEYBALL': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Sports biopic based on the Oakland A's 2002 season in which general manager Billy Beane used statistical data (for the first time) to assemble a winning team, overcoming the team's financial drawback. It was co-written by two of the best writers in the business, Aaron Sorkin and Steve Zaillian, from a story by first time writer Stan Chervin which was in turn based on the book 'Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game' by Michael Lewis. The film was directed by Bennett Miller and stars Brad Pitt as Billy Beane (as well as Jonah Hill in a great supporting turn). You don't have to know a lot about baseball (and Pitt claims to know very little) or even enjoy it at all to enjoy this film; it's more about the business of the sport as well as following the passion of one's dreams. It's a very well made and effective film on that level.The film starts out recapping the Oakland Athletics loss to the New York Yankees in the 2001 postseason. We very quickly learn the team's financial handicap as it's explained to the viewer that the A's had to make do with about a third of the budget as the Yankees. They lose their three star players as a result of this and Billy Bean's dreams of winning a World Series seem almost out of reach as he asks the team's owner for more money and comes up empty handed. Then he meets Peter Brand (Hill), a Yale economics graduate working for the Cleveland Indians. Brand's ideas on building a team based almost solely on the players' 'on base percentage' value impresses Beane and also represents new opportunities for his team despite their lack of money. He hires Brand and the two follow Brand's plan wholeheartedly despite running into a great deal of opposition from the team's scouts, coach (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and just about everyone else in baseball.You don't have to know a lot about baseball to enjoy the film because there's not a whole lot of baseball in it. This film is about as much about baseball as 'BULL DURHAM' is. It's much more about the business end of baseball much like the writer Aaron Sorkin's last film ('THE SOCIAL NETWORK') was much more about the business of facebook than actually about facebook. I found it very interesting as well as informative and entertaining. Sorkin and Zaillian's script is very witty and packed with clever dialogue. It's also strong in character development and Pitt shines in the film. He and Hill have awesome chemistry together as well and Hill, like always, is a scene stealer. The rest of the cast is pitch perfect also and the directing is perfectly fitting too. It's one of those films that just hits all the right notes and leaves an impression long after viewing it (or should, I predict). If you're a baseball fan you'll probably get a kick out of it, even so, too (especially if you're an Oakland fan) for it's history and nostalgia.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOH74YX2UKA",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""It's hard not to be romantic about baseball."" Impossible, perhaps.","Whatever problem you may have with the accuracy of the history of the A's ascendency in baseball in the Billy Beane era, the movie rates as one of the finest films about the game—and that's saying a lot because there are a hell of a lot of good baseball movies. They certainly over-played Art Howe as the bad guy but fiction needs a villain, or something close to it. With the truth put aside the story is a great one and the major points are history. As James Thurber says, you can look it up. What makes it even more exciting for me is the fact that I was right there in Seattle watching—like a train wreck—as the A's took the lead in August with their spectacular 21 game streak.The acting and writing in the movie are sublime at every turn and some of the best examples come in the form of one-ended phone calls—usually with Brad Pitt shoving some sort of junk food in his pie hole.Just because the A's didn't win the World Series doesn't mean that moneyball doesn't work. Every team loses every yearexcept one, and that team is always a rich club. More than anything this movie screams out for revenue sharing in baseball because without the A's there can be no NY Yankees. Spanish soccer could definitely learn something from American football as 2-3 clubs seems to dominate here year after year (it's mostly Barça and Real Madrid).This is a brilliant observation I found in the forum from user tricksoftrade01: ""Rooting for the Yankees or the Red Sox is like cheering on the schoolyard bully who knocks down a smaller kid, steals their lunch money and then kicks them in the balls.""",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A humorous and insightful sports movie that avoids the clichés,"Sports movies have always been preoccupied with what's happening on the field, the court or what have you. They tell stories of underdogs defying the odds and champion values of honor, courage and determination. ""Moneyball"" peels back that obvious first layer yet achieves all those very same ends. The sport of baseball is essential to this story, but the story isn't dependent on baseball.Oakland Athletics General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) faced a debacle after his team lost the 2001 ALDS after being up on the New York Yankees, a team with three times the payroll. His star players, Jason Giambi, Johnny Damon and Jason Isringhausen, were all free agents that the team would never be able to resign. Knowing that fans and the owner would expect another winning season, Beane turned to a young man named Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), an expert in sabermetrics, or boiling down statistics to evaluate players' value rather the traditional scouting techniques and intuition. Together, Beane and Brand scraped together a team of undervalued players and made an improbable run at a pennant.Foremost, ""Moneyball"" tells Beane's story and the emotional ups and downs of trying to change the game. He didn't care about championships or winning in the figurative sense, but about changing the game so that smaller teams would no longer be ""organ donors"" for wealthy clubs like the Yankees. Pitt continues to impress with his comedic abilities as Beane, playing him not all that dissimilar from Lt. Aldo Raine (""Inglourious Basterds"") in terms of charisma and humor, but obviously Beane is a much more believable and compelling character.Hill works as a terrific compliment, going for understatement and never so much as attempting to take any comedic reigns. He opts instead to wait for and pick his moments and then nails them. Whatever ounces of humor veteran writers Steve Zaillan and Aaron Sorkin's screenplay chooses to toss at us, none of it falls flat, especially thanks to the splendid delivery of Pitt and Hill.Baseball has a key role in the film and fans of the sport will enjoy the feeling of being behind- the-scenes, but ""Moneyball"" never gets lost in a preoccupation with the outcome of the games and whether the A's win or lose. Natural curiosity will be there for those unfamiliar with their early 2000s baseball history, but the story generates much more interest in how losing or winning will impact Beane. Devout baseball fans are used to only media portrayals of GMs that consist of either great praise or blame for the level of talent on the field, so this narrative perspective wherein Beane is a protagonist we actually like constitutes a drastic change.The underdog team element that permeates most sports movies exists in small doses in ""Moneyball."" Director Bennett Miller shows us just enough in-game action to raise the stakes and improve the suspense — no more, no less. The players depicted in the film, such as Scott Hatteberg (Chris Pratt), David Justice (Stephen Bishop) and Chad Bradford (Casey Bond), are supporting characters that enhance the story on the periphery instead of through needless subplots. We still feel what's at stake for them and appreciate the ""second chance"" of sorts that Beane has given them. Philip Seymour Hoffman as disgruntled A's manager Art Howe shows the unflattering side of coaches and serves as an effective roadblock on Beane's road to success.If anything, there's a bit of a disconnect in the film between the philosophy of what Beane and Brand did and how it actually translated into success. There's talk of taking more pitches and montage scenes of Beane and Brand coaching the players to an extent, but we're asked to take the film's word for it that the theory was in fact responsible for the on-field results. In the end it just limits the magnitude of the accomplishment. Instead of measuring our satisfaction on the success of the entire team, we measure it on whether Beane is happy or sad.""Moneyball"" amounts to insightful, character-driven drama with a lighthearted sense of humor — a refreshing departure from most baseball or sports films period. One game gets the reenactment treatment, but otherwise no genre clichés hang around in hopes of being used as a feel-good safety net.

Much ado about nothing,"This is my take on a movie called Moneyball that I got to view with a good friend today at noon...Had potential, had a decent set of stars cast, and of course being filmed at the Oakland Coluseum (or whatever they call it these days) with panoramic sights of the beautiful Bay Area and surroundings...a lot of interesting stats and go against the norm dynamics and all the stuff a good movie has to promise...Not one damn sex scene and a lot of nothing to say after 2 hours and 40 bucks light ...I'd say give me an old ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" in front of the boob tube any day...That's the unconveluted and slightly embellished truth...Wait for it to come out on DVD so you can fill the boredom with some of your own extracurricular activity...Sincerely not enlightened by the waste of money that I didn't even spend...;+>",,Anonymous,Biography
You REALLY have to be familiar with pro baseball to keep up...,"Or else you won't know what's going on watching a lot of scenes of managers negotiating with scouts and signing agents as a strategy for creating a winning pro baseball team on the cheap.It's a strategy movie and it's very well made and acted, but I have to warn you that you may get lost if you don't know a thing about baseball. You really have to pay attention to phone tag sessions tricking people into selling one player and canning another and why that's a winning strategy and a brilliant one as you will see.It changed the way pro baseball did business in a way that will get you scratching your head on how it was done. It's basically centered around buying and positioning players in the field based on what they accomplished or ended up being good at on the field statistically despite their quirks, not based on their specialization, popularity and price tag.I liked the characters and the realism, ambiance and mood depicting the business of pro baseball. It was enjoyable given I knew very little on the subject of the movie but it's not deserving of 10 out of 10 in my opinion.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Now I want to learn to play baseball.,What a beautiful game. I'm from Greece so I was never exposed to baseball and that's such a pity. The movie was really good and the acting was even better.

Does achieving success always mean winning?,"Does achieving success always mean winning?That's the big question Moneyball takes on, and it answers it in a really intriguing way. The film shows that success doesn't always come from winning, but can also be about thinking differently and using data to make the right choices.As someone who's obsessed with stats and data, I could easily spend 3-6 hours a day collecting and analysing football and film data. If you had a look at my Google Sheets, you'd probably think I'm a bit of a stats nerd. So naturally, Moneyball really hit the spot for me.The Characters... Where the Real Magic HappensOne of the best things about the film is the writing of its characters. Moneyball is definitely one of those films where you fall in love with the characters. Billy Beane and Peter Brand were written so well, and without the incredible performances from Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill, those characters wouldn't have had the same impact. Jonah Hill in particular - where's he gone? He's such a great actor and really brought something special to his role.The DownsidesAlthough I really loved the film, I think it could have gone a bit deeper with the secondary characters, as they did feel a little underdeveloped at times. But that's just a small thing that doesn't really take away from the overall greatness of the film.Difficulty Connecting to BaseballIt might be a bit tricky to connect with the film if you're not into baseball, and that could take away a bit of the enjoyment for some. But honestly, that didn't stop me from absolutely loving the film. It really moved me and left a lasting impression.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Hats off to Brad Pitt,"Brad Pitt hits it out of the park in the new blockbuster ""Moneyball."" He plays a man named Billy Beane who is a former major league baseball player. He is now the general manager of a low budget team called the Oakland A's. The Yankees beat the A's in the playoffs, causing them to lose their three best players. Billy now has to rebuild the team without the money that the other teams have.When Billy meets Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), everything changes. Peter studied economics at Yale and he has a strategy that he believes will give Billy a winning team. Even though everyone around them disagrees, they are headstrong in their theory and refuse to give up.I am not a big fan of baseball or sports movies in general, but ""Moneyball"" kept me glued to the screen. It's extremely interesting and it makes you think. There are multiple 'laugh out loud' moments and others that may make you cry. Moreover, it's based on a very touching, true story.I was astonished at Brad Pitt's performance. In my opinion, this is his best movie. He is incredibly believable in this role. In addition, it was great to see Jonah Hill play a more sophisticated role; he was very impressive as well. This film was cast impeccably.My only complaint is that it can get slow at times. It's a very long movie and a couple scenes seem to drag on. But the change of pace does fit with the tone of the storyline.This film is definitely timeless and appropriate for all ages. I give ""Moneyball"" a 9 out of 10 for its amazing acting and original story. You don't have to love baseball to love this movie.",,Anonymous,Biography
Non-baseball people will still enjoy this movie...,"...since its dramatic elements are universal: an underdog takes on the established rich and the comfortably smug and beats them by changing the rules of the game.Baseball was fertile terrain for this, since sport even at the highest professional level is notoriously anti-intellectual and conservative. Baseball men would rather underachieve than face ridicule from their peers by rejecting common practice. This is made clear early in the film. Baseball scouts and front office personnel are shown to be making decisions on team makeup in an ad hoc, seat of the pants fashion that disappeared in most other enterprises with the coming of the information age. But any battle against established wisdom and entrenched power has heroic qualities and makes for compelling drama. Baseball just happened to be the venue this time out.The story: after losing key players to richer organizations after the 2002 season, Oakland GM Billy Beane faced the same to succeed as them but with less resources. He needed a cheaper product. His response quietly revolutionized baseball by challenging conventional wisdom about player evaluation and showing it up. The fact that the 'moneyball' approach is now almost universal in pro baseball gives the film's subject the weight of historic interest, but even if the experiment had failed the mission itself was heroic and historic.Brad Pitt, creates a full bodied performance as Beane, a man risks his career and reputation to implement his quiet revolution, while dealing with the fact of a failed playing career and a failed marriage with as much dignity and practicality as he can, and without turning his experiment into a quest. Beane's passion for the game drives him forward without blinding him to the fact that he is running an experiment that might fail. He weathers a storm of opposition and ridicule from others around baseball, from a skeptical and misinformed media, and even within the ranks of even his own team, while he (and the audience) watch the season play out.Jonah Hill successfully underplays a bright outsider on the fringes, whose insights into the game career baseball men won't admit exceed their own, and who serves as the catalyst and caretaker of the Moneyball experiment. Robin Wright strikes the perfect note as the ex-wife who bears Beane no ill will but who has nonetheless moved on with her life. Beane's personal drama is past, but the big public one playing out everyday in the sports pages should be enough conflict for anybody, including the audience.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Home Run!,"American underdog sports movies are far from a new concept, but rarely does one come together as well as Bennett Miller's MONEYBALL. It's something of a hard sell, given that the film more concerned with statistics and percentages than the game of baseball itself, yet writers Steve Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin craft a surprisingly compelling story, and Miller's understated, almost old-fashioned direction allows the beauty of the story to play out naturally, despite a slightly overlong runtime.As previously mentioned, MONEYBALL is more of a business film than a sports film, telling the story of the under-funded Oakland Athletics' 2002 Major League season, a season where general manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) and freshly graduated economics major Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) shook the game's backroom strategy to the foundations. Brand's radical approach (selecting a team based on statistics rather than individual performance) isn't exactly the most cinematic of concepts, yet Zaillian's excellent story construction coupled with the wonderful dialogue from Sorkin simplifies what could be a densely intimidating and complex subject, with breezy, relatable, and very entertaining results. Much like Sorkin's Oscar-winning THE SOCIAL NETWORK screenplay, MONEYBALL uses the real-life events as a frame to hang much grander ideas on, and even for viewers unfamiliar or uninterested in the sport, there is much here to enjoy.No discussion of MONEYBALL would be complete without special attention being paid to the fabulous double act of Pitt and Hill, both arguably delivering the finest performances of their careers. The two play so well off of one another, with Pitt in particular revealing a little seen everyman quality which fits his character, and the film, perfectly. Beane lives everyday with the spectre of past failure hovering around him, yet his ambition is never shaken, even in the face of tremendous adversity. It's a remarkably mature performance from Pitt capping off a very strong year (inculding similarly solid work in THE TREE OF LIFE), suggesting that he has finally shaken totally free of his pretty boy 'star' image to become a vastly talented actor, the Robert Redford heir apparent which many have been foreseeing for years. Hill also surprises in an against-type role, but is unquestionably second fiddle to Pitt.There is strong competition from several films in this year's Oscar race, yet MONEYBALL more than deserves to stand alongside the best of them. Subtle, heartfelt and inspiring with perfectly pitched performances, Miller, Zaillian, Sorkin and Pitt knock it out of the park.tinribs27.wordpress.com",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Any Given Sunday without the testosterone: very well acted, scripted, shot and peppered with bouts of humour and heart.","It's pretty safe to say that what little knowledge us Brits have regarding major American sports like Baseball, Basketball, Ice Hockey and American Football tend to stem from cinema. These titanic past times that comprise a lofty part of US culture and identity just don't get the coverage they arguably deserve over this side of the pond. They're still more or less exclusive to our star spangled cousins who, to their credit, have actually given the world some credible films centred on their beloved four like Field of Dreams, White Men Can't Jump, The Mighty Ducks and Any Given Sunday. So what about Moneyball? Capote director Bennet Miller's rousing and inspired semi-biopic about a pivotal period in contemporary Baseball starring major league thesp Brad Pitt. Well, it's good. Very good, in fact. You could even go as far as saying it's a little bit special.Nominated for six Oscars and based heavily on a true tale that unfolded around the early noughties, Moneyball is a character based docudrama that even those with zero Baseball knowledge can be taken in and moved by. Pitt plays Billy Beane, a former ball player who's now the haunted general manager of the Oakland A's; a cash strapped major league team who are down on their luck. They've just lost their final and most important game of the season and look set to lose their 3 best players with no financial gain as a result. Bean must now rebuild the team for the upcoming season with next-to-nothing in the way of cash and appeal. Despite resistance from his staff and the media, Beane enlists the help of a Yale educated economist (Jonah Hill) and begins to assemble a team of misfits based on stats, facts and figures and forever changes the way Baseball is played.If, like me, you're unfamiliar with Baseball politics and procedures, a general manager answers only to the club's chairman and is required to broker deals and contracts for current and would be players. It's basically his job to pick the players that make up the squad. It's then down to the head coach and staff to field the team for a given game and implement tactics. Got it? Right, back to the film.Despite revolving heavily around everything Baseball, the lasting impression Moneyball leaves is that it is more of an honest and thoughtful meditation on one man's desire to make amends and restore a level of personal pride and dignity. As the volatile Billy Beane, Pitt brings his A-game to the field and exhibits all the charm, wit, skills and natural talents that have made him one of the most diverse and commendable actors at work in Hollywood over the past 3 decades. When Pitt's not dabbling in conventional pieces of high-concept dribble like Mr. and Mrs. Smith and Ocean's Twelve, he can act up a storm and does so with Oscar- worthy ease in this: his latest and, perhaps, greatest pitch. His portrayal of the bitter and quirky general manager hell-bent on re-writing the rule book ranks easily amongst some of the 49 year old's best work. As a teenager, Beane was prematurely lured into the pro-leagues with promises of fame and glory. It didn't work out. Neither did his marriage. So, he turned to scouting in attempt to right wrongs.Jonah Hill's assured, Oscar nominated turn as Beane's studious assistant is also worth a mention for this may signal a break away from the funny fat guy roles that have comprised the bulk of Hill's career so far. Make no mistake about it though, it's Pitt who steals the show in what some believe was ""the"" performance that should've bagged him that long overdue best actor gong.Don't be fooled by the facade and grandeur of an underdog Hollywood sporting film starring an A-list star or two, Moneyball isn't your typical sports film. Think Any Given Sunday without the testosterone: very well acted, scripted, shot and peppered with bouts of humour and heart. You don't have to like Baseball or even sport to enjoy Miller's Moneyball. In only his third film, he has steered a total of 4 actors to Oscar nods now which is an impressive feat to say the least. His heartwarming spin on Steven Zailian and Aaron Sorkin's adapted screenplay deserves its place alongside both this year's best pictures and the all-time greats of character based sporting pictures.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Excellent Story,"Without saying to much this film has everything you could ever want in a film great action, great acting, and a beautiful and wonderful story. The only reason I give it 9 instead of 10 was due to the way they spoiled the girls song with additions at the end. And the fact that he didn't make some decisions which could of helped him achieve more. But it is understandable some people are idealistic and place greater things, above the value of money. Which I think adds another level of depth to this well named film title.Iam from the Uk so baseball is not one of our main sports but I loved this and all the other big baseball films I've seen such as The Natural, The Babe, Field of Dreams, A League of Their Own and Mr Baseball .

You feel the tension well emotionally, and in anticipation.Family relations are heart-warming, and the film creates a great atmosphere for the viewer throughout. Difficult to fault, all-in-all.

made a fan out of me,"I've lived in Oakland for over a decade - since a few months before the story of Moneyball starts. In a town where local elections are swayed by candidates' stances on building a new A's ballpark, I had never heard the story Moneyball is based on. Which is to say, I'm not a baseball fan.Sure I've seen a few A's games, but they were either free or less than the cost of a movie ticket. We got the cheapest seats, since you can basically sit anywhere you want once the game starts. I live in Oakland, but AT&T Park (where the Giants play) is actually closer and a much nicer place to spend an afternoon anyway. So you see, I'm one of the 99% that put the A's franchise in its current lowly state.Add to this that I am one of the vocal minority that absolutely hates writer Sorkin's previous effort, The Social Network, plus the fact that I never much liked Jonah Hill, and that leaves only the fact that it's set in Oakland as the reason I watched.But I liked it.A great deal of that admiration is for the screenplay. Not the story, which, although timely, is thin. And, just like with The Social Network, the characters don't involve me at all. So it can only be the script and acting that puts it over the top. A style of dialogue that seemed stilted and implausible coming from the mouths of teenagers in The Social Network, fits the hardball business culture of this movie perfectly. Plus, Beane's daughter's singing is brilliant, equivalent in role and effect to the song and dance in Blue Valentine.I don't love Moneyball, but for a little over two hours Pitt & Co. kept me interested in the sport of baseball, and that's about two hours longer than the real-life A's can manage.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Film Hits All the Bases,"Well-written, well-acted, and well-directed. Sometimes there's not much more that needs to be said. Moneyball is an authentic film, and Zaillian, Sorkin, and Miller don't allow the false notes to creep into the film. With a runtime of just over 2 hours, it flies by.Based on a true events, Pitt plays Billy Beane, the baseball general manager of the small- market Oakland A's who, back in 2002, realized that if his team was to have any chance of competing against big-market teams like the New York Yankees (with a payroll 3-4 times larger) he would have to change the way a baseball team is traditionally assembled.Beane discovers a young, stat-obsessed scout-in-training (Jonah Hill) that believes the best way to gain wins with little money, is to carefully assemble a team with the type of players who do one thing well, and are overlooked or undervalued by other teams.Throughout, Beane must deal with the resistance and skepticism of the team's owner, manager, players, press core, and fans who do not believe that non-stars or players past their prime, can outperform a team of more traditionally attractive players.Beane also struggles to maintain a close relationship with his young daughter, whom he only has partial custody of, while his job appears to be in constant jeopardy.Moneyball isn't a traditional ""rah-rah, the little team that could"" type of story (thankfully, as that is a storyline that's been played to death over the past 20 years in film). Rather, it is a film showing the struggle and failures of one man and his insistence in fighting an entrenched mindset of people who think a the the methods and rules of a 100+ year game cannot be changed.The crazy ideas of today, often become the acknowledged wisdom of tomorrow.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

A movie about winning and failing,"Moneyball is not a movie about baseball. It's a movie about becoming successful, but at the same time it's a movie about failure.One of the elementary questions in team sports is to discover players respectively to evaluate them in some way to ensure comparability. Where will we be with this squad at the end of the season? Is it worth buying this player for a certain amount? Putting together a team sounds easy at first glance, but it's not. An individual player can be convincing in his own right, but whether he also works as part of a team is another question.In a small team, the question of money is a crucial factor. You can't afford coveted players. Our own players will be bought away by bigger teams. So how do you still manage to be successful? You have to go other ways, you have to question the system. This can lead to historic achievements, but it can also lead to failure. In any case, it takes a lot of courage.The strategy for selecting suitable players targeted in the movie presents scientifically determined key figures over the experience of established scouts. Brad Pitt is putting all its eggs on one basket. Developing a strategy is one thing, but implementing it with all the consequences and pressure that entails is another. If you win, you are celebrated; if you lose, you are beaten up.You have to try to find a reasonable middle ground. This is shown by the fact that Billy integrated Peter into his team out of pure intuition. He is young, inexperienced and yes, he is not a player, but there are many more roles in a functioning team. Each cog must mesh to continuously improve and push the team further. The movie provides some really interesting insights into this overall construct.In summary, I'm not interested in baseball at all, but still found the movie to be outstandingly good. This is mainly because the movie can be seen much more generally. On the one hand, of course, it provides insights into the daily business of a sports team and clearly shows that things are dirty behind the scenes. But it also shows that you shouldn't bury your head in the sand. If you are really convinced of something, then you should do everything in your power to realize it. You can fail, you may not get the recognition you deserve, but you must never give up.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Fascinating bio: both for human interest & its inside look at baseball,"(This film is based on the true-life book of the same name by Michael Lewis.)Billy Beane, the General Manager of the Oakland A's, is wrestling with trying to put together a winning baseball team when his budget is the lowest of any major league team. Whenever his team does well, the more affluent teams hire away all his best players. How to win?--or even survive?Beane (Brad Pitt) turns to the work of Bill James, who invented a variety of new statistical ways ('sabermetrics') for evaluating major league baseball players and what it takes to win ball games.Billy finds a statistical nerd & baseball addict, Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), a recent Yale economics graduate, who understands how to apply Sabermetrics to identify and hopefully acquire those low cost players who would be the biggest help to the team's winning. Billy makes Brand his team's assistant GM and risks everything, daring to walk a plank -- either leading to an abyss or across a bridge to success.In part, the film shows the conflict between the old, time honored style of largely intuitive evaluations by baseball scouts and coaches versus this use of strange, new, statistical evaluations.In recent media interviews, baseball insiders say this film really captures the feel and scenes inside club houses, BB meetings, negotiations, etc. But it also has touching, human elements (e.g., between Beane and his daughter).The book/film, based on true events, is only slightly prettified.(Quite a bit more about James & Sabermetrics is described in Wikipedia; search it for: ""Will James Sabermetrics"". And/or google ""Paul DePodesta,"" the actual assistant GM for Beane, on which the film character of Peter Brand was based.)",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

I usually can't stand Jonah Hill but I thought he was excellent in this and he and Pitt had great chemistry together- there were a lot of funny moments between the two of them, and Pitt in general was pretty funny throughout the movie, eliciting some big laughs from the crowd.

More than baseball,"Moneyball examines a deeper premise than how the 2002 Oakland A's managed to form a contending baseball team with a small payroll. While there is a lot of baseball in the story, it is not the whole story.Brad Pitt plays Billy Beane, the GM of the Oakland A's (still is) during a time when it appeared baseball was ruled by large payrolls. Right away, you are shown how the Oakland team loses three big talents to the more well-healed baseball teams (Yankees, Red Soxs) and now they need to find players to stand a chance to compete but at one of the lowest payroll levels in Major League Baseball. Billy discovers Grant (Jonah Hill) who uses a different, more calculated approach to evaluating talent than the old tried and true method of subjective evaluation by long-time scouts.The story is crisp, the movie cleanly presented, and well-acted by the two principle actors. Aaron Sorkin's writing fingerprints are all over it. It is fine movie making.But the story isn't just about baseball, it is about how objective tools are used to decide how the talent is acquired and used. We are seeing more and more of this in our daily lives. If you work for an employer, there is a strong probability that how your efforts are graded are done using a scale that is cold, hard, and unmoving. What was once a series of perceptions and opinions by your boss are now hard straight facts. It is because the humans that manage other humans have a series of preconceived notions of how well you do your job. Humans are fallible, so our evaluations are flawed too.I once created a computer program to play the board game Monopoly with me. I figured that I should be able to beat it more than it beats me because I wouldn't be able to construct a rich set of logic rules that would beat my cognitive abilities. After playing against it many times, I was surprised to find that it could beat me six out of ten games. Reason? I was subject to making decisions based on gut feel instead of cold hard logic and I made faulty decisions. The computer didn't, so it won more times than not.Moneyball is the same thing. A roomful of scouts deciding on which players they should go after is flawed and will ignore those that deserve consideration while accepting those that don't. This is expanding to our workplaces as well and we will be accepted or rejected based on firm data than someone's opinion. As a teacher in a high school, that is exactly what testing has done for schools. It is probably coming soon to a workplace near you.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

The baseball is just a canvas that Michael Lewis used to paint his familiar themes that he has more commonly expressed in stories about Wall Street.Anyone who has read Michael Lewis's other books, ""Liar's Poker"" and especially ""The Big Short"" and who has seen his extraordinary 2012 Yale commencement on Youtube address will have found the same themes running throughout his work; that people are often mis-valued because of luck and circumstances outside their control; that people are too easily fooled by appearances; that ""convention wisdom"" is often no wisdom at all; that it takes an outsider to see through the arbitrariness of ""conventional wisdom; that the outsider going against the tide will be ignored or treated as a fool; that it takes an unusual person driven by some personal flaw or demon to stand apart from the unthinking mob and to persevere against the opposition. It is this last theme that is the real focus of his work what makes his stories so compelling.The story of Bill Beane personifies all these themes. He is another version of the oddball lot in the 'Big Short"", Mike Burry, Steve Eisman and the Boys from Cornwall capital who saw through the facade of the big Wall Street Banks went all in against them, and even the story of Lewis himself, who walked away from a sure multi-million dollar Wall Street career because he thought that it was all nonsense and would rather find a new ""senior thesis."" Billy Beane is another oddball outsider with the character flaw. Billy was a great high school talent, 6-4 the perfect picture of a baseball player. but was missing something that kept him from being the star that he was supposed to be. (The book explains much more of this when contrasting him with Lenny Dykstra, a small, 13th round draft pick who managed to make it big). At age 30, when still in his prime as major league player, albeit a fringe one, he quit and asked for a job at a scout, shocking just about every one from players to management. What character flaw leads a person to trade the wealth and fame of playing in the majors, the dream of players, fans and management, to become a bush league scout? It's easy to see why Lewis fell in love with the story.Billy knows that appearances deceive because, after all, he was the perfect example. He was everything a star player was supposed to be in the eyes of the scouts - except he wasn't. He has suspicions about conventional baseball wisdom, but he himself has been baseball too long to completely come free of them. Then he meets a real outsider, Peter Brand, a Yale economics major who never played baseball and doesn't look like he ever could. Brand confirms Beane's misgivings about traditional wisdom when he explains precisely why appearances are so often wrong and why scouts and their conventional wisdom are based on a superficial understanding of what matters in winning. It all boils down to what Beane later describes as ""selling jeans"" - finding the right body, even the right face. Judging by appearances and ignoring real performance. Better yet, Brandt offers an alternative, using one of Lewis's other themes, they players are often mis-valued because of luck or other irrelevant circumstances, they pitch funny or they hang out at strip clubs, etc. Beane buys in, partly because of necessity and partly it confirms his suspicions. He not only selects players based on Brandt's ideas, over the vehement objects of old guard scouts, but he also goes so far as choosing a new head scout precisely because the man never played baseball and was untainted by conventional wisdom.Then comes the next phases of Lewis's storyline, the scorn, laughter, and conflict with the insiders who see their position and self worth being questioned. Finally, there is eventual, if not complete, vindication. This leads to the film ending in two wonderful scenes. The Jeremy Brown video scene and his daughter's song both captured the spirit and the message of the film in a graceful ways.In sum, it's a very nice movie of ideas. It certainly isn't about baseball. It's about how our view of the world and our judgment of other people and even ourselves is so often based on the wrong things, the surface things.Note added: Most of the ideas that Beane used to select players in the movie had been learned from his predecessor as GM, Sandy Alderson, who is never mentioned in the movie. Alderson got them from reading Bill James, the godfather of the new statistical analysis who was contemptuous of standard baseball thinking. He wrote some really interesting and philosophical books on the subject of statistics and baseball while working as a night security guard at a pork and bean factory. He is also mentioned once, although Peter Brand is presumably meant to represent James+Paul DePodesta.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A Ploddy, Unenthusiastic Look at an Amazing Story","With the hype surrounding Brad Pitt's newest offering, I took it upon myself to venture down to the cinema to take in ""Moneyball"". What drew me in wasn't the story - I know very little about baseball - but a cast including the amazing Philip Seymour Hoffman and Jonah Hill in a serious dramatic role. It had a lot to live up to.Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane (Pitt) is desperate to have his team make it to the top when young Peter Brand (Hill) offers an innovative system of hiring (and firing) members of the team based on their individual skill instead of overall talent. Beane sees something that could re-define the game and implements his and Brand's idea, to the chagrin of the A's manager Art Howe (Hoffman) and the rest of the scouting team.""Moneyball"" is the second outing by who I considered to be one of the very best in the business, Bennett Miller. Miller gave us Philip Seymour Hoffman's finest (so far) performance in a similar historical film, Capote, which also looks at a flawed man and how his actions affected history. But that's where the similarities end. ""Moneyball"" is a ploddy, angsty look at something that could really make an amazing film. Ultimately, it falls flat.All too often, I would catch myself interested in the upholstery of my chair or the size of the screen instead of what the characters were talking about on screen. It's rare that the film offers any analysis of why certain members of Beane's team were good. Instead, the audience is just told that they're good. That's that. I bet I would have loved this film if I knew who the ball players Pitt and Hill spend so much time talking about were. There's no explanation. I'm just expected to know who was a great player on the Oakland A's that particular year.I'm giving Bennett Miller's film five stars because of exactly that: Bennett Miller. I could tell that he was genuinely interested in Capote, but for most of Moneyball I was wondering if I was more interested than he or Pitt or any of the others were. The strongest performance comes from Jonah Hill, who effectively plays a very boring person. I belived that he was boring enough to come up with this system, and boring enough to not really care how everything turned out. Hoffman sleepwalks through a ten minute performance and about one line for every scene he's in.One very bright spot: Arliss Howard plays the manager of the Boston Red Sox and has a brilliant scene with Brad Pitt at the press box of Fenway Park. Howard effortlessly plays a very small role with unparallel grace. One of my rewarded starts is solely his.You're reading a review coming from someone who doesn't actively follow baseball, but likes a good sports film. I didn't find Moneyball to be a bad sports film, yet I can't say it kept my interest long enough to prevent me from dozing off by the seventh inning.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Best business movie of all times,"I am using this movie when I am doing workshops with the boards of big companies. People think this is a baseball or sport movie, but it is much more. It is a story on how you run business, how you transform it and how you do not accept status quo. The way Brad Pitt is running this team is the way you have to use to run or make a successful company. Bold decisions, removing obstacles, figthing millions of ""you cannot do it"" or ""we were doing this this way all these years"". Maybe the best part is when Henry says: first one getting through the wall always gets bloody. Amazing movie I recommend to any person considering bulding their own business or taking serious executive role.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Just Like Watching Baseball With a Story,"I am a baseball fan (Go Yankees!) and I found this film very interesting. It balances good humor, intelligence, and suspense almost perfectly. Its a perfectly smart movie that keeps you watching until the very end.What really impressed me was the baseball game sequences. The lighting, the intensity, and the suspense made it more entertaining than a normal game you would watch on the sports channel at home. Even if the A's aren't your favorite team, you still feel a desperation for them; you want them to come out of their slump and succeed.Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill made a great sort-of duo. Brad Pitt's character was charming and sarcastic, and Jonah Hill's character was quietly funny and surprisingly intelligent. I enjoyed their conversations very much.Most of the movie, I thought, was like watching a very close baseball game at home. You sit on the edge of your seat, and hope that everything can work out for this team, and that they can score a couple of runs before the game is over. You can also enjoy a few well-placed laughs in between. It's a pleasantly intelligent movie, with good characters, a good portrayal of a true story, a baseball-game-like suspense, and if it loses to Hugo in the Oscars, I will be very upset.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Great movie entertaining and creative all my baseball fans will enjoy this one,"Moneyball"" (2011) is a fascinating and inspiring sports drama that delves into the unglamorous side of baseball. Director Bennett Miller brings a unique perspective to the film, focusing on the Oakland Athletics' 2002 season and General Manager Billy Beane's (Brad Pitt) unconventional approach to building a competitive team.Pitt shines as Beane, bringing a charismatic intensity to the role. He's perfectly complemented by Jonah Hill, who plays Peter Brand, a young Yale economist who helps Beane revolutionize the team's scouting process. The supporting cast, including Philip Seymour Hoffman and Robin Wright, adds depth and nuance to the film.The screenplay, penned by Steve Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin, is witty and engaging, making complex baseball statistics and economic theories accessible to a broad audience. The film's pacing is well-balanced, seamlessly shifting between tense baseball sequences and quieter moments of character development.""Moneyball"" is more than just a sports movie - it's a thought-provoking exploration of innovation, perseverance, and the power of unconventional thinking. With outstanding performances, clever writing, and expert direction, ""Moneyball"" is a home run.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Rookie mistake,"Based on the book Moneyball: The art of winning an unfair game by Michael Lewis, Moneyball charts the true story of Billy Beane (Brad Pitt), controversial general manager of struggling baseball team The Oakland A's. With a budget, three times smaller than some of his rivals; Beane must build a new team for the start of the 2002 season. Coupled with the departure of three of his star players, Beane has his work cut out. Billy's luck changes through a chance meeting with Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) a Yale economics graduate and statistician. Brand encourages Beane to use a sabermetric, that is to say statistical approach to buying baseball players.It will be hard for me, a person with no prior exposure to Baseball, to write a fair review for Moneyball. From the start the film is awash with baseball jargon and statistics and as a result long periods of this film were for me as interesting as the word sabermetric. Audiences can enjoy films jam packed with technical, nonsense terms take Star Trek for the ultimate example. Crucial though is the fact that the plot hinges on these terms. If, like me, you do not know what getting 'on base' is then forget trying to piece a coherent story out of this film. (It means by the way: 'a measure of how often a batter reaches base for any reason other than a fielding error, fielder's choice, dropped/uncaught third strike, fielder's obstruction, or catcher's interference.') – oh right.The dynamic between Pitt and Hill is by far the most enjoyable part of the film, they bounce off each other with ease and at times their dialogue had the wit and snap that you would expect from an Aaron Sorkin screenplay (The Social Network). The phone negotiations over the player Ricardo Rincon is a particularly slick scene.Critics have lauded Phillip Seymour Hoffman's performance as the team manager Art Howe and I have to admit he did not put a foot wrong. He was hardly stretching his measurable acting ability though; being required to fold his arms on their belly and look disgruntled for almost the entirety of the film.The pace of the film is slow and meditative not least because we join Billy as he mulls over a decision he made as a young man to turn down a Stanford University scholarship to pursue professional baseball. We are shown flashbacks of his decision and the consequences. This gave the film some nice depth but by this point I was losing interest in the story and the characters. I could not engage with the story when it was awash with jargon and terminology which were alien to me.The tenacity that was displayed by some individuals to get this film into production is quite astounding. The rights for the book being bought back in 2004 and being passed through the hands of three directors. I struggle to understand the resonance that this tale of stats must have for the filmmakers involved.Director Steven Sonerberg acknowledged that the challenge of making Moneyball into a film: 'to dramatise and make interesting a book about statistics'. For me, they did not rise to that challenge.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Here is a sports film that talks about more than just the players.,"Here is a sports film that talks about more than just the players. Brad Pitt gives us a stellar performance as Billy Beane, a General Manager who started out as a player who never reached his potential. He gives us not only insight into the professional life of Billy Beane, but the man himself. We learn he is divorced, involved in his daughter's life, and trying to remain civil with his ex's new partner. He has ideas that he can't support in the accepted method, but with his reputation, he has a lot of leeway with the owner, and when he discovers Phillip Brand (Jonah Hill), he sees a way to make the kind of team that has the potential to win a championship. Jonah Hill is excellent as Brand, developing his character from the fresh out of college statistician with little self confidence to the man who learns to accept the responsibilities of management. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is strong as Manager Art Howe, but I get the feeling there are missing scenes because we just don't get enough of him in the film. Kerris Dorsey is impressive in the role of Casey Beane, and also co-wrote the song ""The Show"" and performs it for us in a touching scene where Billy is buying his daughter a guitar. For baseball fans, this is a movie about a pivotal moment in baseball history. For Brad Pitt fans, this is a chance to see Brad in a role that doesn't involve spies, cons, wars, and explosions. For the rest of us, this is a film to watch and enjoy. Rated PG-13 for a few scenes with harsh language, I'd recommend it for the entire family. Collectible for sports fans and lovers of good ""slice of life"" films.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great watch,"""Moneyball"" is a home run of a film that hits all the right notes. Based on the true story of the Oakland Athletics' 2002 season, the movie is a fascinating exploration of the intersection of sports, business, and innovation.The film is witty, insightful, and engaging. The dialogue crackles with humor and intelligence, and the characters are richly drawn and multidimensional.The supporting cast is equally impressive, with standout performances from Philip Seymour Hoffman as the Athletics' skeptical manager, Art Howe, and Chris Pratt as Scott Hatteberg, a journeyman player who becomes an unlikely star.Director Bennett Miller brings a keen eye for detail and a deep understanding of the game to the film. The baseball sequences are thrilling and authentic, and the behind-the-scenes look at the team's front office is both informative and entertaining.What sets ""Moneyball"" apart from other sports movies, however, is its thought-provoking exploration of the business side of baseball. The film raises important questions about the role of data analysis in sports, the value of intuition and experience, and the challenges of competing in a league with vastly unequal resources.Overall, ""Moneyball"" is a triumph of storytelling, filmmaking, and sports journalism. It's a must-see for baseball fans, movie lovers, and anyone interested in the fascinating story behind one of the greatest upsets in sports history.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Baseball Brilliance,"Moneyball is a 2011 film based on the true events of the Oakland A's in 2002. Billy Beane (Brad Pitt), a former player turned general manager, grew tired of teams with high budgets always winning games solely because they had more funding. Thankfully, he runs into Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), an economics major from Yale, who he worked together with to attempt to assemble a winning baseball team on a low budget using only statistics.Regardless of your knowledge level or interest in sports/baseball... I can almost guarantee you will enjoy this film. There is enough sports content for avid baseball fans while also having enough drama to entertain the average viewer at home. The storytelling was so well done that I was on the edge of my seat for the entire 2 hour and 13 minute run-time (and also because I had never heard this story before).A movie with a 2+ hour run-time always gives me pause. Did you really need that much time to successfully tell your story? Here, however, I had absolutely no issues with the run-time. The screenplay was concise in that every scene felt necessary and relevant. We got background on how baseball teams are typically picked, why Beane was jaded towards this method, and how he wanted to change it. Beane's character development was important so that we had someone to root for, especially since the majority of viewers probably don't care how well the Oakland A's performed back in 2002.Brad Pitt as Billy Beane is the main reason why this movie is so successful. Brad Pitt has always been one of the best actors in Hollywood and that was cemented for me in this film. He did a superb job of acting out the personal vendetta Billy Beane had against the MLB for the way he was treated while he played. He didn't care what other managers/recruiters thought about his approach to the 2002 season and his passion was contagious. I also love that he's always shoving an entire hamburger or Twinkie into his face in one bite. No matter what Brad Pitt is doing, he always sells it so well and is a marvel to watch on screen.Jonah Hill beside Pitt was fun to watch, but I didn't think Hill's character was as complex and therefore impressive as Pitt's portrayal of Beane. He was a great calm and collected sidekick but I'm honestly surprised he was nominated for Best Supporting Actor. His role didn't warrant that much attention and there is a slew of other actors in Hollywood that probably could've performed the role just as well.One of my favorite aspects of the film was the editing. There were a few scenes that were quick and showed something dramatic that encapsulated how the characters were feeling. For example: the scene where we were looking down a hallway and all of a sudden saw a chair fly and hit the wall outside of an office. Brilliant! So well done.Another detail of the great editing was the combination of old footage with the actual Oakland A's team and the new footage created for the movie. They integrated perfectly together and kept me locked in the entire time.Moneyball was funnier than I expected, had great character development and told the story beautifully. You will not only be entertained but also learn about an amazing experience in sports history. I wish it would've won one of its 6 Oscar Nominations. It definitely deserved it.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Really Fine Baseball Movie,"One of the better baseball movies, this has almost the feel of a documentary, with a realism as it shows how real events played out, resulting in a new modern strategic mindset in baseball.Jonah Hill steals the show here as the brilliant tactician and statistician who figures out how to put together a great team on the cheap. His performance raises the movie to a cut above. This is his movie, in my humble opinion.Bratt Pitt is OK, but familiarly one-dimensional as the man, Billy Beane, who had the guts to run with Peter Brand's revolutionary untested theory on how cash-poor teams like his Oakland A's could compete with the better funded teams. He almost phones in his performance, I feel (some may disagree), but he does enough to represent his character in a way that doesn't take away from the story.But the real star of this movie is the story. It's intriguing enough and well-told enough to make you want to watch the film to the very end to see if the theory worked.Those who are not into baseball might find this a hard film to watch, but baseball fans absolutely have to see it if just to see how these guys changed the face of baseball. Make no mistake - here you see the strategy that has revolutionized baseball (for the better).",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Brad Pitt does it all through his break through performance !!!,"A true story about a baseball team's general manager and how he used computer gimmicks to analyze the performance of individual player and led it to 20 win record. The movie was very well directed along with riveting performances by Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill. Billy Beane( Brad Pitt) is under pressure with the lowest salary constraint in his baseball team. To salvage his team's reputation to win the world series championship, he takes help from Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) to analyze the statistics of the individual team player and uses the data to re-invent the team. He faces lot of criticism from his management, coach but things takes a Topsy turn when the Oakland A's begins to win the streak of games and records a 20 consecutive win for the first time in 103 years of American League baseball. Moneyball is inspired by true story of Billy Beane and is based on a novel of the same name. Bennet Miller , director of Oscar nominated ""Capote"" has done a full justice to a very motivational story of a man who silenced his detractors after facing lot of criticism. The script was handled very efficiently along with a powerful performance by Brad Pitt. His acting has grown over the years and this we can observe from the choice of films he is doing. He emotes everything through his eyes and expression itself makes this film worth a watch. This is first time Jonah Hill has taken a serious role and he was very impressive as in the supporting role. Philip Seymour was just about OK in a small role. An actor of his caliber could have been given more meatier role. The cinematography was outright with soothing background score.

The presentation of this movie is a traditional approach, but that was probably the best way to go. The true story it tells of is inspiring. Who wouldn't be inspired by the story of the Oakland A's, who defied the logic of baseball, and utilized unconventional methods to lead them on a string of back to back victories.The script is very funny, heartfelt, brimming with snappy dialogue, and filled with good characters.

Must See Sport Flick,"As a huge baseball fan, I enjoyed Moneyball very much. I even found it more interesting because it is a part of baseball history that I not only was alive for, but actually remember happening. Moneyball is the story of Billy Beane who was General Manager (and still is) of the Oakland A's in early 2000. The A's at the time had a very small payroll and Beane had to some how come up with a winning team with no money. I'm a Texas Rangers fan and since the A's are in the same division as the Rangers, I saw several of these games and remember some of the players. I even remember the 20 game win streak as it happened. Brad Pitt is a very likable Beane and Jonah Hill plays the man who developed the formula that Beane used to select his players.

Moneyball (2011),"To some Moneyball may seem dry and boring. It's essentially a sports film with very little of its subject sport. Instead it focuses on numbers and statistics, and how sometimes these can be a good substitute for huge pay cheques. I have no real interest in any sport from any part of the world, but I do love me a good sports movie. Moneyball is about Billy Beane, a man that works as a general manager to one of the lesser baseball teams. He is looking for that all important last win of the season, and has his own demons having been told he was going to be the next big thing when he was younger. This didn't exactly pan out, as the scouts failed to question whether his skills would battle against his confidence in the big leagues. These sections are told in brief flashbacks and give us a great insight into the character. They are not completely necessary, but they allow us to see why such a man isn't as motivated by money. Peter Brand comes in and explains that using complex maths, a cheaper team could indeed stand up against the bigger teams. It's a great underdog story, where every player is an underdog as well as the whole team. It shows us the importance of taking a risk, and how sometimes breaking conventions is the only way you might have a chance. Moneyball also works by not being all about success. The successes come with the failures, resulting in a well rounded and thoughtful film. Hill gives his best performance so far, and Pitt further cements himself as a great actor.

Is sport only about appearances or is it about striving to be the best at what you do?Brad Pitt plays a refreshing, real life character, who leads the team of leftovers and 'losers' to victory, despite the overwhelming opposition of everyone else who just don't understand the maths and mechanics of trading, of gambling, of statistics and true sportsmanship.You won't regret watching it, unless you detest Brad Pitt's dimple.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Brilliant!,"When it comes to rating a film, I look at 3 things: Storyline, script, and acting. The storyline for Moneyball was intriguing.

However, if you are a baseball fan, it is definitely a plus! Aaron Sorkin is a genius. Everything he has written or created is always witty and brilliant. I think of the Social Network, A Few Good Men and The West Wing series. Moneyball lines up quite well next to all of those films. As far as acting goes, Jonah Hill was fantastic.

General,"The movie is about Oakland Athletics' 2002 season, during which the team's general manager, Billy Beane (played by Brad Pitt), uses advanced statistical analysis, known as sabermetrics, to assemble a competitive team despite the team's limited budget.Beane, a former player himself, teams up with Peter Brand, a young Yale economics graduate who has developed a system for evaluating player performance using advanced statistics. They challenge the traditional scouting methods used by the team and identify undervalued players who can help the Athletics win.This film explores themes of innovation, risk-taking, and the challenges of working within a constrained budget. It also delves into Beane's personal struggles and his relationships with his daughter and the team's manager.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Brad Pitt's bet pays off big.,"The fact that this film ever got made with its troubled production history is a minor miracle, but due to Brad Pitt sticking with it did get made. His faith in the material was not misplaced. This film is a major success.There hasn't been sports film this weird since ""Field Of Dreams"". Aside from the performances its pleasures lie elsewhere. The script makes numbers crunching amusing, there are jokes without punchlines, an unhurried pace which allows for potent pauses (as opposed to pregnant pauses) & a confidence in itself which is intoxicating. It also doesn't hurt to have Chris Nolan's Oscar winning cinema-photographer, Wally Pfister, adding what amounts to be almost another character to his shots.Another odd choice was Bennett Miller who brings his art house smarts to this defiantly non-mainstream material. A team of underdogs hasn't been managed/directed this well since with as much success since the '88 Dodgers or the '02 Angels (I live in SoCal).However, Brad Pitt & Philip Seymour Hoffman (he may be underused but he is great nevertheless) are certainly no underdogs. The Mickey Hatcher work here is done by Jonah Hill who soars in his first straight dramatic performance. It is understated & awkward & often very moving & funny because of its total lack of clichés. His execution of the role pretty much describes the whole movie.BUT make no mistake about it this is Pitt's film. His quiet confidence & ease carries this film throughout & makes it an enormous pleasure to watch.It may help you if you love baseball as much as I do or smart movie-making because ""Moneyball"" is an early Oscar contender.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

The Remarkable Lessons of MONEYBALL,"Truth may be stranger than fiction, but when the sports world is shaken by a methodology that will revolutionize the business of baseball, it becomes an amazing story born out of need. Adapted from the Michael Lewis' bestseller by Aaron Sorkin (The Social Network) and Steven Zaillian (Schindler's List) and directed by Bennett Miller (Capote), Moneyball is a fascinating look at how the sport of baseball was turned on its head and its implications that reverberate to this day. It's also about the bond a father has with his daughter that is stronger than any contract.In 2001, Oakland Athletics general manager and former player Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) is trying to keep his star players from being bought by financially wealthier teams like the New York Yankees. Desperate to field a winning team with a hopelessly limited budget, he happens upon an analyst for the Cleveland Indians named Peter Brand (a winning Jonah Hill) who has statistics to back up his theory that the best players are not necessarily the costliest ones. Rather than compete with the big teams, Beane realizes that the underrated players who are statistically on base the most will translate into runs scored and ultimately wins. The remarkable thing is that these players can be obtained at bargain basement salaries. The concept goes against conventional wisdom and immediately creates friction among the veteran scouts and even the A's manager (played to perfection by Philip Seymour Hoffman). A former star recruit himself, Beane blew his chance for stardom at an early age and is now sharing custody of his teenage daughter with his ex-wife (Robin Wright). He loves his girl and fears that losing his job will force him to move farther away from her. As the team begins to show signs of becoming a winning organization, a remarkable string of wins begins that will make history and have far reaching consequences for the game of baseball.This is one of the best roles Pitt has ever had. The dialogue is perfectly suited to him, and he delivers flawlessly. It's the kind of role you could easily picture with a younger Robert Redford. When he says things that stun his personnel staff by deviating from common practice and status quo, it is a hoot. I mean he really shakes things up because he is willing to try just about anything to win games, and it also means changing a culture of losing into a winning attitude. Just watching the negotiations and deal making behind the scenes is fascinating. You also get a realistic perspective from the clubhouse as players come and go, but these are people too with families, and the film does not shortchange this point of view.What elevates this film from its novel plot line is the genuine relationship between Billy and his daughter that influences his priorities. He isn't just a general manager but a father, and the film never loses this perspective to its credit. When the team's fortunes change dramatically by the end, an astonishing opportunity presents itself to Billy that puts him at a career crossroads, and the baseball world takes notice.Even non-baseball enthusiasts may find this a fascinating story because it is character driven with strong performances by its cast. (Sports movies get made with semi-regularity, but when did a studio make a film about personnel management of a major sports team?) When you think about the recent championship success of teams like the Boston Red Sox and look at this film, the connections are mind boggling. And while this new age in personnel management is a story onto itself, the one constant through it all is a father's love for his daughter. Top notch all the way.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Very Sorkinesque, Pretty Good","Moneyball is all about Brad Pitt. Because the film ties Billy Beane's journey of self-discovery to that of his sport, and because there's a surprising amount of psychological depth to Beane himself, this film transcends the typical sports film. At the same time, it's a very exciting sports film in and of itself.The sad thing about professional sports today is that to spectators and players alike are excited by the whole phenomenon up until the point where they lose. This is a film that deals almost exclusively with how to deal with defeat and how victory itself is tenable. That says more about life than much of sports does today.This is Aaron Sorkin's third movie (Charlie Wilson's War and The Social Network) since making the abysmal television show ""Studio 60"" and committed every sin imaginable in the TV writer's bible (don't have all the characters sound alike, don't use the show to air out your dirty laundry, try to at least pretend to care about where your story is set, etc.) and he's been using more and more restraint on those Sorkinisms. Occasionally, Sorkin still gets cringe-worthy as in the conversation between scouts about how they shouldn't put in a pitcher with an ugly girlfriend.Another weakness of Aaron Sorkin seems pretty subverted in Jonah Hill's shy and introverted character of Peter Brand. Unfortunately he drifts a little towards Sorkinish territory towards the end. On my top ten list (which I'm working to rapidly construct a couple weeks later than everyone else), this lands at #2. Not as profound as ambitious as ""The Tree of Life"" but it's more intense and kinetic than anything else I've seen this year and it marries that intensity to a stronger story than a typical action or sports film",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Win with computer stats and number generated statistics?,"""Moneyball"" is a pretty interesting take on how to win at the game of baseball. And it's enjoyable and relevant because it's based on the true story of real life Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane and how he turned around the team with the help of an Ivy league graduate computer whiz Peter Brand, plus it was based on a book by Michael Lewis. Aside from that it's thoughtful showing the inner workings of brain trust of how to manage players and the under worked deals of putting together a winning baseball team. Plus the film has realism by showing actual baseball footage so the viewer can feel he's watching the big leagues.Also the chemistry between Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill is top notch Pitt is to be believed as the stressed out and rugged go against the grain Beane who clearly takes a different approach to winning. As he proves instead of heavy spending to build a team he seeks the help of a computer educated analysis director in Peter Brand(Jonah Hill joys it up). And while watching you see the feel of an underdog developing as Billy wants to win as he remembers his failure when he didn't develop into a big league star. The film is drawn showing the viewer some intrigue and drama yet just like the big baseball climax it wins in the end. It's a good feel to see winning can be done a different way, this film did indeed hit a home run.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Uplifting and brilliant !,"Sometimes a movie comes along without any fanfare and blows your mind inside out for its sheer story telling, fluid story and impact-full acting. I feel this is one of those movies. this movie is a gem and gives the viewer few clichéd (why i say clichéd is these words are so misused or over-hyped in flicks in general...they often lose the meaning of the same) things called hope and courage in times of adversity. It has a razor sharp editing, a haunting score and a brilliant cast. Jonah Hill is a revelation. Coming to my favorite actor since ""Sleepers"" and ""Legends of the Fall"", Brad is absolutely fantastic in this role which is quite difficult to portray. There are only few emotions to express in this non violent, non romantic, non bete-noire, non-scifi, non-action drama. But, Brad scores a perfect 10 in portraying his emotions, his sorrow and single minded focus towards his goal. I've resisted seeing this flick for many weeks until now just because i thought it was a baseball drama and i don't understand a word of this game..:-). For baseball lovers, it would be a great movie. For guys like me, its a lesson in every facet of life. To sum it all, I would like to salute Mr. Bennett Miller who has directed this movie with such crispiness and never a moment the scene loses plot and just cuts through... very taut and ""to the point"" direction.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

A fantastic movie about leadership and the drive to follow through on your beliefs,"Rarely does a movie come along about sports that is as insightful and moving as Moneyball. I am a sporting fanatic, not so much a baseball but I maintain a significant interest in a number of other individual and team sports.However I found it very easy to connect with this film, not only because of it's sporting background, but more than anything because of it's characters and their very real and well told stories.Bennett Miller brings to life an incredible story of men who having failed in their lives thus far to live up to their potential for one reason or another, are given a second chance to rewrite the script and change their destinies.It is not a new story and the formula has been applied many times before, however what I liked about the movie was the subtle insights it provided into the way societal fundamentals and norms about commonly accepted approaches can lead to whole industries forming incorrect perceptions about the limitations of individuals and very often teams of individuals comprised of those with these incorrectly perceived limitations in capability.This can apply to any area of life and not just sports and provides a timely reminder that just because things have always been done a certain way, it does not mean that they should continue to be executed in that same manner. In life, we should examine everything, there are no sacred cows.The story also demonstrates that with radical change comes strong resistance and one must always have the inner strength and belief to withstand the inevitable criticism that comes when implementing change in order to succeed.Brad Pitt and Bennett Miller deserve plenty of praise for this film, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a feel-good story with substance.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the better behind the scenes movies,"Baseball, baseball, baseball. I thought that maybe I did not want to see another baseball film. After all, hasn't it all been said and done? Well, maybe not like ""MONEYBALL"", which is more about what is going on behind the scenes.Well... yes. The movie focuses on how talent and teams are made circa 2002.Brad Pitt plays ""Billy Beane"", the general manager of the Oakland Athletics. bean enlists the aide of his assistant, Peter Brand, and with statistical analysis known as saber-metrics, that places the emphasis on stats such Beane assembles a group of players. A colorful group.Bennet Miller directs very well with performances and pacing in mind.Steven Zaillian's and Aaron Sorkin's script and the story by Stan Chervin based on the book by Michael Lewis, gives us a moving and fast paced movie without the benefit of a lot of ball playing.Great performances by Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Robin Wright and Chris Pratt.I recommend",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A film showing science's place in sports,"Moneyball is a slow-paced but intricate true sports biopic, highlighting Billy Beane's (Brad Pitt) exploitation of a gap in baseball by utilising statistical analyses above all else. This film makes the little dramas more meaningful, building character development whilst remaining faithful to the source story. The message is ultimately portraying the unlikeliness of financially vulnerable teams making it anywhere in competitions today, but also gives insight into one of the true underdogs in sports history.A consistent soundtrack adds pathos to the more meaningful scenes, not relying on dramatic plot twists to propel the story, and helped by accurately reconstructed scenes from baseball history. Brad Pitt is strong in his role, and this film also features Chris Pratt and Philip Seymour Hoffman. The standout, however, is clearly Jonah Hill: his innocent voice and quiet intelligence perfectly depict the revolutionary thinking of a modern genius.Family matters and intra-team disputes take a back seat in Moneyball, but the true story background allows this to not become meandering, making this film a worthwhile watch, particularly for sporting fans.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A great story done justice,"How does one make a compelling film of when data science beats intuition? Moneyball is one of those examples.Who doesn't love a good underdog story?Disclaimer: I'm a huuuge Oakland A's fan. So my review may be biased.Moneyball follows the typical bad-team-becomes-good trope that's common in many sports movies. Yet, like Billy Beane's (Brad Pitt) approach, Moneyball takes an unconventional turn.One aspect that I admired from Bennett Miller is that he also explored the different conflicts that face each character. We see GM's and Team owners pushing Billy Beane to handpick successful athletes that will make the team great. We see each team member's fear that they're past their prime. And we see the emotional toll that this takes on Billy Beane and his family.This is a thought-provoking movie that doesn't go too far into the statistical details. It keeps things interesting for those with a passionate love of sports and has an interest in the Moneyball story.Dig deeper and one can find deeper meaning in this story. We can see the shifting realities of the sports world as they move from all-stars to cold statistics. We see the implications that algorithms will have over human intuition and what that can mean for the world. We also see the fall of Oakland after other, more well-financed teams start to pick up and use Oakland's successful method, leading the A's back to underdog status.4/5. A great story that was done justice by this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
