Kind of all over the place but distinct enough,"A strange movie. It is kind of all over the place with its themes and influences but it has a distinct enough personality and some solid setpieces.This is a straight adventure story with giant monsters, and the way it's shot and the hammy dialogue are mostly B-movie and comic book derived (check out those Dutch angles and blistering colors and 10 times too big sun, moon, aurora...).But there's also a clunky Vietnam metaphor that's a straight-up over the top ""homage"" to Apocalypse Now, et al. The song choices even more so. It makes sense in theory (VietKong anyone?) but I don't think it ever really works and it's just an excuse to make Sam Jackson a bad guy to counterpoint Kong's ""human"" side.Characters are fine for the most part. They serve their cardboard purposes and that's what's expected. Hiddleston and Larson in particular feel vastly underdeveloped. Everything they say and do fall instantly from memory and their disappearance from the movie all together wouldn't have changed it that much.But what we want are monsters and we get them. Most of them are wonders to behold (the water buffalo, spider legs, and octo tentacles yum) except the generic Skullcrawers (the scene where Reilly names them is embarrassing - I don't think Larson or Hiddleston had any idea what to do the dialogue is so ferociously dumb. Reilly almost saves it however).This Kong feels like a very different movie than the new Godzilla. This is very much an entertaining B-movie with strong comic book influences worn loud and proud. It will be interesting to see how these two worlds collide. If any franchises deserve an extended universe, it's these! That's what they're all about.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Shut Down Your Brain and Enjoy the Adventure,"When the Vietnam War ends, Bill Randa (John Goodman) and his partner Houston Brooks (Corey Hawkins) from the Monarch organization succeed to get the financing for an expedition to the recently discovered Skull Island from Senator Willis (Richard Jenkins). He hires the former Captain James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) to guide the expedition; a group of soldiers under the command of Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson); and the awarded journalist and photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson). On the arrival, the helicopters need to cross a storm and soon they drop bombs on the forest to map the seismology of the island. Soon they are attacked by a huge gorilla called Kong that destroys the helicopters and kills part of the crew and scatter the rest through the island. The group commanded by Conrad meets Hank Marlow (John C. Reilly), a survivor from the World War II that lives with a tribe of natives. He explains that Kong protects the island and the natives from underground monsters and shall not be killed. But Colonel Packard is insane seeking revenge for his men that died.""Kong: Skull Island"" is a brainless adventure with several stupidities. For example, the number of helicopters in the beginning of the journey of Randa, Conrad and Packard is totally incompatible with the size of their ship. Bo pilot would dare to cross a storm like that in a helicopter. The attack of all the helicopters to Kong is absolutely imbecile. Most of the survivor's attitude are at least unreasonable. On the other side, the adventure is highly entertaining and the special effects are top notch. Therefore the best option to the viewer is to shut down the brain and enjoy the adventure since this is the purpose of this type of blockbuster. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Kong: A Ilha da Caveira"" (""Kong: The Skull Island"")",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Enjoyably distracting monster movie,"Looking back at old movies, the effects date quickly and they become rather cheesy in their simple pleasures. Someday I will do that with this film, because essentially it is a creature feature, albeit one that happens to be being delivered with the biggest stars, biggest budget, and state-of-the-art effects. And the thing is, despite all this superficial polish, the film is essentially big monsters and spectacle.On this front it is enjoyable though; it has plenty of action, lots to look at, and a reasonably successful mix of humor and drama. I say reasonably, because the plot isn't up to much, and different characters seem to be in different films depending on who they are. This is matched by the performances which range from the silly fun (Reilly) to the stupidly OTT (Jackson) to the starry but bland (Hiddleston, Larson); the film doesn't seem to have a handle on what it wants to do, and the mix that it produces is not always successful, and it relies on big moments of action and noise to try and cover it. Perhaps at some point there was some smart commentary about US foreign policy in there, but that is lost in the mix too.Still, it works as a monster movie with great effects and lots of polish, so enjoy it for that even if there is not too much beyond that.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Tour of Duty makes an excursion to Skull Island,"I usually don't comment on massively budgeted blockbusters, but ""Kong: Skull Island"" is such a joyfully tongue-in-cheek homage to giant monster B-movie cinema that I simply had to make an exception! This is a tremendously over-the-top and silly creature-feature, but the undemanding popcorn-entertainment value is just irresistible. The original King Kong, from 1933 already, is a monumental piece of cinema and still very powerful today. The more recent (2005) and expensive Peter Jackson remake was, at least in my humble opinion, a very boring and overlong romantic drama. ""Kong: Skull Island"" nicely falls right between these two extremes. By no means, it's great cinema, but at least it provides thrills, chuckles and adrenaline rushes from start to finish. The intro and scene-setting are already incredibly dumb, but oh so fun! We're supposed to believe that there exists a secret government agency (yes, another one) named Monarch, and their area of expertise is searching around the world for monsters and oversize animals. In 1973, The agency's CEO (an energetic John Goodman) benefices from the US-army's retreat out of Vietnam to recover soldiers and assets for a mission to the secretive Skull Island; a place where - and I quote - God left his creation unfinished.""Kong: Skull Island"" certainly doesn't waste any time! The helicopters have barely begun circling over the island, and there already emerges the humongous ape King Kong to slap them out of the sky like tiny ping-pong balls! The few remaining soldiers, led by the frustrated platoon leader Samuel L. Jackson, continue on foot and swear to destroy King Kong, but they soon learn that the island homes lots of other giant and unspeakably evil monstrous creations, and that Kong isn't even such a bad fella. It's a mission impossible to take this film seriously, but with the right mindset (and perhaps a few six-packs of beer) you'll have a great time. Seeing the story takes place in 1973 and has an abundantly clear Vietnam collection, it also somewhat feels like a long-feature ""Tour of Duty"" movie with a downright awesome 70s soundtrack. The special effects are cheesy and exaggerated, the dialogues are deliciously tacky (""hm, a mushroom...that means there must a river nearby!"") and the casting is perfect. I already mentioned John Goodman and Samuel L. Jackson, but there's also John C. Reilly as the bewildered WWII veteran who's been stuck on the island since 1942.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Delivers the goods for fantasy-adventure lovers,"Released in 2017 and directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts, ""Kong: Skull Island"" takes place in 1973 where a military crew about to depart Vietnam is commissioned to guide an expedition to map out the eponymous island. Of course, the giant ape, Kong, is soon discovered, as well as several other deadly colossal creatures, including reptilian underground monsters dubbed ""Skullcrawlers."" Will anyone make it out alive?Like my title blurb says, this delivers the goods for fantasy-adventure lovers. The opening act is great with its kinetic air and excellent late 60s/early 70's soundtrack. The rest of the movie more or less keeps up the entertainment value, highlighted by the racially diverse cast, led by Samuel L. Jackson, John Goodman, Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson and John C. Reilly; there are many others.""Skull Island"" has the high adventure demanded in a King Kong flick and is arguably on par with the original ""King Kong"" (1933), as well as the 1976 and 2005 versions, although it's superior to the latter because it lacks that one's pretentious over-length, cartoonish CGI-jungles and overkill action sequences (like the absurd brontosaurus stampede). Of course, it's criminal to compare a modern CGI-oriented flick with a classic like the 1933 film (or even the '76 version); I'm just saying that, if you favor those movies, you'll probably relish this one because it's cut from the same cloth and is effective for what it is, a colossal creature adventure flick. For further comparison, ""Skull Island"" is pretty much as good or, IMO, better than any of the Jurassic Park pictures.Along with the thrilling jungle escapades, there are some interesting subtexts and gems to mine, like the quasi-Ahab subplot and the fact that dropping myriad bombs might not be the best answer. Early in the film the photographer (Brie) tells the the gung-ho Colonel (Jackson) that America lost the Vietnam War. Yet, this isn't really accurate since the USA won every battle of that infamous conflict. So the colonel rightly corrects her: ""We didn't lose the war; we abandoned it.""The movie runs 118 minutes and was shot in Ha Long Bay, Quang Ninh, Vietnam; Oahu, Hawaii; and Queensland, Australia; with studio work done in Los Angeles.GRADE: B+",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A stylized version of Kong that you may or may not have wanted,"Some people go to the movies to be wowed by the superb acting, heart wrenching and well written story, and overall solid production... THIS has good effects? The acting in this film isn't bad, but it definitely won't win any awards for it.The story has characters Bill Randa (John Goodman) and Houston Brooks (Corey Hawkins) piggybacking on an expedition to an uncharted island to test their ""hollow earth"" theory. Tom Hiddleston plays a tracker, Brie Larson plays a photographer, and John C. Reilly plays a surprisingly funny WW2 vet marooned on Skull Island.The film takes place in 1973 and loves to remind you with CCR and old technology as if it was a hundred years ago. Kong: Skull Island pays homage to Apocalypse Now quite frequently even though it seems a bit excessive at times.Kong looked good, almost all the creatures looked cool and all the fights between them looked really good, especially in IMAX 3D. Some of the green screen effects, like backgrounds behind characters, were distractingly bad. Ultimately, you get some great stuff out of all the effects if you're not looking too closely.The characters are more hollow than the earth (according to the film's characters themselves), the story is mediocre, but the effects reign king in this film adaptation.My suggestion: See it! it's a blockbuster meant to fill seats, not win awards. Take it for what it is.Seen at an advanced IMAX 3D screening in Minneapolis.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Completely Entertaining Throughout,"THIS is the way a movie should be done.Have you ever watched the scene from The Princess Bride where the grandfather tells the kid: It's got everything. ""Fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, giants, monsters, chases, escapes, true love ..."". Well, in a way, that's this version of KONG, and I am really happy and surprised at just how GOOD it was.Take a bit of the original Kong, mix it with one part Private Ryan, a dash of The Deer Hunter, some Monty Python, lots of Jurassic Park, a pinch of A Space Oddity and mix well with some (insert your favorite lower-key funny movies HERE). The result is a pleasing fare one can really sink their teeth into and enjoy.It has some familiar faces too, and what's best about it, is that not only do they live up to their so-called stardom, but even the unfamiliar or not-yet- ""famous"" actors with smaller roles, really do a great job and sell it. At no time while you are watching this movie do you feel it far-fetched or unbelievable that Kong actually exists, and isn't that, in a nutshell, what all movies should aspire to - the suspension of disbelief? Mission accomplished on this one, and good job to the creators.A definite must-watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Better Than Expected Adventure,"The legendary King Kong returns in an all new adventure that gives the classic tale a much needed update and new setting. Unlike Perter Jackson's retelling of the original Black and White film, ""Kong: Skull Island"" eschews the old for the new and in doing so breathes a much needed new life and vitality into the franchise.The film is set in 1973 when William Randa (John Goodman), informs the government that they have detected a previously unknown island and need to investigate it before the Soviets learn of it and beat them to whatever the island my hold.William recruits a team which includes a former British officer named James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston), and Photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson), to assist his team lead by Houston Brooks (Corey Hawkins), in mapping the island.William also asks for a military escort and the government enlists Lt. Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson), and his team to accompany the mission. Packard is trying to find his place in the world as he and his helicopter combat team are dealing with the recent end of the Vietnam War. His men are looking forward to going home and resuming their lives, but a dour Packard jumps at the chance for another mission over the uncertainty of the future.Upon arriving on the mysterious island and starting their survey mission by using seismic charges, the team attract the attention of Kong who is not at all pleased with the intrusion on his island. Kong makes short work of the copters and the team finds themselves scattered about the dangerous island. They soon learn that Kong is not the only danger on the island and must find a way to rejoin each other and make it to their extraction point alive.Naturally some of the characters have a hidden agenda and there are dangerous and action around every corner. Further complicating matters is the appearance of Marlow (John C. Reilly), a downed WWII pilot who has been stranded on the island for 23 years and warns of dangers far greater than Kong that are ahead of the team.The film combines a solid cast with state of the art special effects to take a new twist on the standard adventure fare. While many parts of the film remain silly Popcorn entertainment, the quality of the assembled cast allows the film to move beyond being just an assembly of potential victims for a menagerie of CGI creatures to dispatch. While the story is more in lines with the linear and thin plots of adventure films of old, the sum of the parts does add up to an enjoyable film experience for those who like the giant creature films. You will want to make sure to stay after the credits as there is a very good scene that shows a setup for a future film that had those in attendance at our press screening cheering.The film may be a bit intense for younger viewers but if you are looking for a touch of nostalgia and action, you may find the film just what you need.3.5 stars out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Kong is King,"My review is short and sweet.Half the people on here saw it on the day it leaked - just check review dates - and on their phone screens and then can't understand why they didn't really like it.Not much you can do for those people if they choose to cheat themselves out of a great movie experience, but just don't let them cheat you out of one.This is a very well put together movie with excellent everything including cast, sound, graphics, plot, lines, cinematography, you name it.Can't do more than point you in the direction of a good movie and up to you to watch it or not, but in my book, this Kong was King.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better Than Most Kong Remakes,"Any movie, or anything, really, that keeps my attention is good. Although I didn't really like the orange tinge everything seems to have in the very beginning, the technical side improves dramatically as the film progresses.It takes place in 1973, just after the Americans ""abandoned"" the Vietnam War (according to Samuel L Jackson's Preston Packard character). The 70's production design is good and brings me back to my childhood (the soundtrack was awesome with plenty of 70's hits), although you don't see much of the 70's vibe after the first 20 minutes or so. The CGI is very good and doesn't make me feel like I'm playing a video game. This movie is like Jurassic Park meets Godzilla and they had a baby called Platoon and it grew to become a mash-up of the three of them with its own uniqueness called Kong: Skull Island.Just under two hours in length and ""hold onto your butts"" and watch the credits.My favourite quote from the movie is, ""A camera is more dangerous than a gun."" Seems like SLJ get's all the good lines.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A film of stunning scenery and shallow thrills,"Some of the superficial elements that make up Kong: Skull Island, almost make the film worth watching, almost. An exotically stunning picture where the rain forests are so bright and golden as if sunlight was radiating from in between the trees. Kong emerges under the fiery halo of a setting telephoto sun that takes up half the screen. But it was that that moment when I began to have this feeling that I've had too often before, the movie is spectacle and little substance.We begin with John Goodman convincing a senator to fund an expedition to a newly discovered island (captured by satellite camera). He also gets the luxury of a military escort. Enter Samuel L. Jackson as the commander, perfectly type cast with his bravado Schick that is no longer entertaining. The film also succeeds in wasting Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson. The highlight of the cast, is John C. Riley. Stranded on the island for two decades, he has befriended the local indigenous people and knows all the Islands secrets. His humour and energy, are a relief from watching everyone else perform with zero enthusiasm.As for King Kong, He is the biggest we have seen yet in a major motion picture. Unfortunately he is stuck in a movie that is not 'King Kong'; a movie that about a monster finding his humanity. This Kong is all about attitude and not soul. The idea is that he is the guardian protector of the island, who fights to keep nature in balance, by controlling the numbers of the other big inhabitants. He is the last of his kind, and his family was killed by a species that looks like an amphibious version of the distinctive skulled ape in Temple Run.The climax pits Kong against the big daddy of these beasts, a riveting fight scene but with an inevitable outcome. Other highlights include a daddy 'super' long and another giant insect that can disguise itself as a decrepit fallen tree. The jarheads in the movie are virtually nothing more than bodies to feed to creatures like these. In fact the movie often feels like a realized version of the games we used to play with dinosaurs and little toy soldiers.Director Jordan Vogt Roberts seems to be mimicking Michael Bay films. You can see it in his use of slow motion, his stagy camera angles, and framing, and in his comic book color palette. He handles his action scenes with a greater sense of orientation, but like Bay, he fails to summon any suspense, thrill or anticipation. The film always seems too eager to get to the action oriented punchline of every scene.The finished product, is a sexy looking, 50's throwback monster movie, with lots of crazy beasts, stunning scenery and nothing in the way of character development or intelligent dialog. Samuel L. Jacksson points a gun and says, ""unless you tell me what I don't know, I will blow your head off."" You can't get much cheesier than that right?",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A sufficient reboot of the King Kong franchise,"Kong: Skull Island is a monster film starring Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L. Jackson, John Goodman, John C. Reilly, and Brie Larson. Packed with all the giant monster movie clichés and fun action scenes one would hope to see, it serves as a sufficient reboot of the King Kong franchise.In 1973, a group of explorers led by a band of soldiers journey to a mysterious uncharted island in the Pacific Ocean. Upon arrival, the group realise the island is swarming with giant monstrous animals and insect-like creatures who have called this place their home for millions of years. After becoming separated amidst the chaos, the groups eventually meet with the local natives who worship a skyscraper-sized ape named Kong who protects them from the giant monsters.While the film doesn't offer much in terms of actual plot, the action and fight scenes more than make up for it. The special effects were great and the CGI for Kong and the other giant monsters were all very convincing. The characters were all essentially stock action roles but thanks to the believable performances from the lead actors, they're still fun to watch. I also enjoyed the fact that Kong has more screen time and a greater relevance on the film's story, unlike with how Godzilla was barely in the 2014 film. I look forward to seeing these two monsters duke it out in a future film.I rate it 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Truly Great Ape,"Movies used to be fun. Genuinely fun. Kong: Skull Island is a throwback to the era when movies were fun - like, Stars Wars fun. Like Jaws fun. That kind of fun. The leads embody characters that are all understandable and genuinely likable. The plot isn't stuffed with technical geek references and ""easter eggs"" that weigh down other universe-building films. From the fire- singed Kong fur to the slick skull crawler tongues, the special effects are brilliantly detailed and animated. And it's genuinely refreshing to watch an action/monster film in which native peoples are depicted with dignity and respect, and where black and Asian characters aren't used as props or fodder for violence (admittedly, the film could have gone further with this, but I sensed some progress being made). Kong: Skull Island isn't Life is Beautiful. It isn't Casablanca. But it is genuinely, thrillingly, rigorously fun. It has heart, scales, teeth and a ferocious roar. Monster movies are back. Get in line. Hail to the King.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Big on action, thrills and pure spectacle and lean on everything else, this latest iteration of pop culture's mightiest simian is good old monster mash fun","No sequel, spin off or remake has come close to matching up to the mythology of the 1933 classic, and just to be sure, neither does this latest iteration of pop culture's mightiest simian. Instead, this origin story largely set in the 1970s when America was pulling itself out from the quagmire of the Vietnam War inspires to be no more and no less than a monster-mash adventure of epic-sized proportions, pitting not just Man-against-Kong but Man-against- nature-itself, the latter represented by supersized species the likes of towering spiders, blue-blooded pterodactyls and giant saw- toothed lizards referred to as Skullcrawlers that are all too eager to get a literal taste of human flesh. Oh yes, this is a CGI showstopper in many, many more ways than one, with state-of-the-art Industrial Light and Magic technology complemented with inventive creature design by Carlos Huante to create a fitting modern-day throwback to the B-movie action-driven creature features of the past.Dispensing with any hint of nuance, the straightforward and utterly functional plot has John Goodman's scientist cum bureaucrat Bill Randa assemble a team under his top-secret government-funded Monarch project to explore the hitherto uncharted Skull Island, a long- hidden landmass in the South Pacific hidden by constant electrical storms and magnetic interference which has been only recently uncovered by the first Earth-mapping satellites sent up into space by the US. Among those whom end up one way or another on the mission: Tom Hiddleston's former SAS officer turned tracker-for-hire James Conrad, Brie Larson's anti-war photojournalist Mason Weaver, and last but not least Samuel L. Jackson's embittered Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard and his helicopter squadron (some of the more recognizable faces include Shea Whigham and Toby Kebbell). There are about a half dozen other characters too difficult to keep track once the film gets underway, such as Jing Tian and Corey Hawkins' pair of token-minority scientists who get a couple of pointless lines and no real purpose.Withholding knowledge of the real intent of the expedition to ""document the existence of massive unidentified terrestrial organisms', Randa instructs Colonel Packard's men to start dropping bombs from their helicopters under the guise of mapping the island seismographically, which naturally irritates the hell out of its eponymous chief resident. Kong's grand dramatic entrance consists of hurling a napalm tree towards one of the choppers, before tearing through each and every one of them by either ripping them apart or tossing them against each other. Oh yes, you'll be glad to know that (unlike Randa) Kong doesn't hold anything back right from the get- go, meaning that you will get to see him in all his massive vicious glory in every single scene that he is in. That awesome introduction not only cuts the ensemble down to those in the opening credits and divides them into two groups, but also sets up the enmity between Kong and Packard.Given the simplicity of the storyline, it is no surprise that the characters are but stock types – in fact, the most fully developed character only joins midway through the film, a WWII vet named Hank Marlowe (John C. Reilly) who survived the Japanese pilot after him when both their fighter planes crash-land back in 1944 and has since learned to live peacefully among the natives there. Reilly steals every scene he is in – more than just as supporting comic presence, he is a real live wire injecting warmth, humour and dryness as an eccentric lost-in-time pilot. Jackson comes a close second with his brash gusto, but the rest of the actors are not much better than as body count.But really, who are we kidding – you're probably not here for the story or the characters but the damn ape himself, and boy, does he look magnificent. With tactile fur and soulful eyes, Kong comes to life in breathtaking realism, aided with motion capture by 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' actor Terry Notary. This Kong is majestic on his own (one such moment has him taking a break in a lake while Kebbell's terrified major watches from behind a rock a few feet away), and jaw- droppingly powerful during any one of the startlingly photoreal sequences of bestial combat. It bears noting that the monsters which emerge to challenge Kong or which simply make an appearance as part of the fauna of the titular island are also just as stunning, especially a confrontation in a foggy graveyard between the remaining survivors and a Skullcrawler and the climactic Kong- versus-giant-Skullcrawler smackdown that is impressive even by modern-day CGI standards.Despite being a visual effects novice, indie director Jordan Vogt- Roberts proves right at home in a big-budget motion picture. He creates an immersive pre-historic paradise to complement the exciting monster scenes, and mixes 70s war imageries from 'Apocalypse Now' and 'Platoon' into the 'Jurassic Park' setting to keep his audience hooked. Because of his firm grasp on pace and rhythm, what is two hours feels much less so – and if there is one unintended outcome of that, it is the fact that we end up wanting to see more of Kong. As much as it is Kong's movie, there are also stretches in between where he is nowhere to be seen, and the other nasty dino-like creatures on Skull Island take center stage to exert terror on the human intruders.Ultimately, this is a movie fashioned on pure action spectacle, using state-of-the-art CGI to breathe new life into the old-school monster movie mash genre (you would do well to note that this is meant to be an origin story in Legendary/ Warner's MonsterVerse franchise, setting up the beast for a planned showdown against Godzilla in 2020). It may all seem familiar, but that doesn't mean it isn't fun or thrilling, so really just grab your popcorn, sit back and enjoy the ride.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
great creature feature!,"Boy did I enjoy this film.forget plot and logic. This is an all out creature feature...It is called Skull Island because that's where the action takes place with all the neat creatures.There is a LOT of screen time devoted to Kong and the monsters. And LOTS of cool death scenes. Pretty gory, in my opinion, and surprised this got a pg-13. Some scenes would be very frightening for little ones.Most surprisingly, it is the the acting of John Goodman and J.C. Riley that stands out - even overshadowing tom Hiddleston. I am not a big fan of Goodman or Riley, so this really surprised me.For the plot - people go to Skull Island. They encounter Kong and various giant monsters. Mayhem and death ensues. Some return home. The end.Doesn't sound like much but the monster scenes really made the movie, and Kong was fantastic. They really had him move - he was almost like a giant Hulk smashing those airplanes!Oh, and PLEASE stay after the credits. What was shown put a BIG smile on my face...

"Kong: Skull Island is not the traditional King Kong. But if you accept that, this is a really fun time.","I say that this is not the traditional King Kong for many reasons. This is not the same story that you all know and love. This is barely even the same monster; this one is much taller. The whole movie really only exists to set up 2020's Godzilla vs Kong. That being said, this is a fun, action packed movie, that rarely feels like a cheap setup to another movie.The story revolves around a group of scientists and soldiers in the nineteen-seventies who conduct experiments on Skull Island, unaware of the monsters that inhabit it.The concept is not taken as seriously as many previous renditions of Kong. It focuses mostly on intense action, and features comic relief, mostly via John C Reilly's character. But it is still suspenseful, with many characters dying unexpectedly. It also has some pretty good cinematography, and many scenes reminiscent of Apocalypse Now.This new version probably won't appeal to all King Kong fans. A lot of people will probably hate the lighter tone and the liberties taken with the monster. But it does what it set out to do: deliver a fun action movie. It is nowhere near as good as the original, or even the Peter Jackson remake, but I was thoroughly entertained by it. I'd also say I'd prefer it to the recent Godzilla movie it's set to crossover with. This is a good movie if you know what you're getting into.jaythemovieguy.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Entertaining but lacking,"I must say that I feel this movie lacks a bit of consistency, it starts with a decent story but then it just goes down leaving a bunch of questions unanswered and some plot holes.While you can see the effort in developing Kong and the crawlers,every other creature in the island is just there to fill the huge void in the plot.The guys at legendary pictures apparently heard how everyone complained about ""to much plot and not enough Godzilla"" in their last monster movie production and turned this into something similar to a ""transformers movie"", it's full of visuals but the story is lacking and some characters have no motivation or logic in their actions.I can't say it's a bad movie, but it's a wasted opportunity to expand the lore of the franchise, you will exit the cinema feeling that something was not there.It is obvious they are trying to turn this into a profitable franchise, but when you give priority to visuals instead of plot, you end up with movies like ""Alice in Wonderland"" and it's sequel, or any of the recent ""Transformers"" movies, pretty to look at, but completely forgettable, and doing that to a character like King Kong feels just wrong.However,I would like to see more monsters movies in the future, and Kong skull island was enjoyable and a fresh take to a character that's been around for over 80 years, you probably won't become a fan of ""kaiju"" movies watching it, but let's hope next installments in the franchise are better.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Extraordinary...,"I have seen this movie yesterday. That is an extremely interesting movie. Firstly, the content is great, it teaches us to respect the nature and finally Kong is always the greatest king. Secondary, the effects are so amazing, each small detail is so real. Thirdly, the landscape is very beautiful, I know that this movie is captured in Vietnam, my beloved country, and I am so proud of that. Finally, this is a movie that we can't miss.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
good monster action,It's 1973. Bill Randa (John Goodman) convinces a senator to fund his expedition to an unexplored island with expert tracker James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) and documentarian Mason Weaver (Brie Larson). Bill hires Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson) and his soldiers who are finished with the war. They are flying helicopters dropping explosive charges to map the island when Kong shows up to bring them down. Some of the survivors encounter natives and Hank Marlow (John C. Reilly) who crashed during WWII.There are some good monster action. The characters are mostly one-dimensional. The start is a bit meandering. It's thirty minutes before getting to the island. Fifteen minutes is plenty. I don't care about Randa's backstory or the political backdrop of the situation. John C. Reilly is off trying to do comedy by himself. Kong lacks the needed humanity. The best is the monster action and Kong fits well in that aspect. The giant spider is amazing creepiness. The movie needs more of those types of thrills. This is an old-fashion monster movie with state of the art effects.,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Don't go into someone's house and start dropping bombs unless you're picking a fight,"As far as big blockbusters go, Kong: Skull Island is not half bad. The first 30 minutes or so pass by and plays out in typical fashion, the soldier stereotype as seen in countless films meat headed with a gung ho mentality. Which in essence is a moral of the film ""don't go into someone's house and start dropping bombs unless you're picking a fight"". The first 30 mins despite the roaring action is pretty dull, the CG graphics are pretty spellbinding the detail on Kong specifically.Not until John c Reilly turns up was I fully invested and in all honesty he steals the show. He provides a couple of dazzling lines and weirdly enough injects some much needed heart into a so far emotionless ride.The music was good except it suffered from the ""suicide squad"" syndrome it was over used almost to breaking point. An excellent use of Jefferson airplanes white rabbit can always be forgiven though. Kong references a whole bunch of other films some obvious choices, others not so obvious. Ranging from music cues (the shining, fear and loathing in Las Vegas) then to some more on the nose Vietnam flicks ( apocalypse now, platoon, full metal jacket)Never tries to be smart and plays Upto the ridiculousness of the story to good effect. In all honesty I've never seen a Vietnam pastiche quite like it. For the most part it's extremely enjoyable and there is tons of fun to be had.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Should be John C Reilly Island,"I just saw a sneak preview of Kong: Skull Island. I don't think this will be a long remembered monster movie. It's a fun movie, but ultimately forgettable. The CGI Kong, Samuel L Jackson, and John Goodman all took a backseat to John C. Rielly, who did a superb job playing a WWII pilot who was shot down and landed on Skull Island. Seriously, his role is the greatest thing in this movie.The movie is set in 1973, and the premise is that LandSat (land mapping satellite) has taken pictures of an elusive island (Skull Island) that has been rumored to exist, but not proved. John Goodman convinces the government to launch an expedition to explore the island. They take some soldiers who were pulling out of Vietnam, and are headed by Samuel L Jackson. They also pick up a British ex-special forces ""tracker"" (Tom Hiddleston) and an ""anti-war"" photographer played by Brie Larson.They start the mission by dropping bombs on the island to map the bedrock, ostensibly to look for mineral deposits. That's when Kong shows up to smack the helicopters out of the air, and generally wreak mayhem on the team. The scattered survivors then have to survive on an island filled with monsters and get to the extraction zone. One group finds John C. Reilly's character, who has been stranded on the island for 29+ years.That's about all I'll say about the story, so as to avoid serious spoilers. The story line is fairly conventional with very little arc to the characters. In many regards it actually sets up more like a horror movie than action/adventure movie. In fact, there are numerous jump-scares and other horror movie devices throughout the movie.In many ways, it felt like the movie couldn't quite decide what it wanted to be. Is it a monster movie? A horror movie? An action movie (anti-war)? There are also numerous characters who seem like they were intended to play more significant roles. For instance they bring along a biologist, played by Tian Jing, who does no biology and seems to mainly appear to allow another character to give exposition. Similarly most of the LandSat team, who seem to be around for comic relief (horror movie style comic relief). Even some of the major characters do little aside from provide a single plot piece.Then there is Kong. I think they could have spent a bit more time developing Kong, partly as a character and partly as an animation. The CGI was pretty good, but his proportions looked wrong and his motions were wooden.Anyway, I think there was just too much going on, and not enough time for this movie to be really good. I think it could have been an excellent mini-series, or TV season. As it is, it's an okay movie, that is fun if you go in with a low-bar. 6/10, so I enjoyed it, but not enough.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Decent action flick....,"I came to this film not expecting a great deal. I was then surprised to find a decent action flick with a subtle anti war, pro environment message.....First off this is above all else, an action flick. The fun starts from the get go and continues at a good pace throughout this film. Unlike previous Kong films, this time its humanity intruding on Kong's patch not Kong being transported back to civilization. Personally, I think this approach works far better. It allows for a world of CGI generated, larger than life creatures, like Kong to be brought to life, creating an outlandish but fun jungle style adventure.Whats also appealing is the pro environment, anti war message. Without giving too much away, the warmongers in this film really don't fare too well. Mess with nature and pay the price. Something we should all keep in mind.The acting is for the most excellent helped by well rounded, colourful characterizations, that, whilst not too realistic, fit snugly into the rather fantastical world of Skull Island.In sort, I really enjoyed Kong Skull Island and I think you will too. Eight out of ten from me.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Dumb Fun action film,"As someone who watched a black and white action figured kong to peter jacksons Kong climb a tower, I really enjoyed seeing the character return in his own habitat. Seeing the Island fleshed out with other creatures, knowing the tribals perspective and culture around Kong I enjoyed it. Action packed and dumb fun.The human sections are very one dimensional but a good effort is made to make them tolerable, even reasonable in their own movie logic convictions. I can't say I connected with any character nor was I rooting for them to survive. Big stars, big talent wandering in their mediocrity till their next MCU payday.As my title suggest, dumb fun action film. I'm excited what the future holds for this icon of a monster.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Stupid People on a Stupid Mission,"I can't contribute much here because most of the nay-sayers have already said ""Nay."" First of all, we have no real idea why the government would ante up for this ludicrous venture. Once the Senator decides to go along with it, a truly idiotic array of cannon fodder and expensive helicopters head off, not knowing a thing about their reason for doing so. The early scene of Kong destroying the copters is asinine. Once he grabbed the first chopper, the rest of the pilots should have backed off and figured things out. Kong's arms are long but about 30 feet would have put them out of harm's way. There is so much that goes unexplained in this thing and so many plot holes, it's hard to get into it. Sam Jackson plays the same part he has played about sixteen times (were there any snakes in those helicopters?). The rest of the stiff acting company does nothing to develop any sort of connection for us. Even the hero guy is about as boring as one can be. I could go on, but others have already poked holes in it enough.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"entertaining, not the best movie ever",Everyone in these reviews needs to chill. This movie was solid entertainment. In no way was I turning it on and expecting to be amazed by the cinematic experience. I watched it because Brie Larson and Tom Hiddleston are hot.

Entertaining Adventure,I was at my gym yesterday with few choices to watch while biking. I didn't get into at first but returned. I love John C. Reilly as Marlowe. The cast is great with Samuel L.

Kong is angry at the monsters who go after the humans. We never really understand why the animals become huge. The special effects are quite Oscar worthy too. The scenery is quite amazing too.

Kong: Skull Island 2017 Review,"Just a quick personal anecdote:In December 2018 I went to Hawaii, specifically Kualoa Ranch where they filmed scenes for Jurassic World, the original Jurassic Park, 50 First Dates, Hawaii Five-O, and Kong: Skull Island. They had a section of the big canyon area where they filmed the bone pit scenes and they still had all the huge styrofoam bones and skulls like the big Kong skull and the triceratops skull. They let us all walk through the field that the characters walked through, but since it's been a year plus since they filmed Kong the styrofoam bones were starting to fall apart due to rain and wind.Anyways, Kong: Skull island is full of action. And coming off of Godzilla (2014) i'm so glad we finally get to see the action as it happens. The action combined with some dope creatures / monsters all with super unique designs keep this film fresh and amazing to look at.
Speaking of, there's also some really nice cinematography / visual choices that I was really surprised by. Character were great, I don't think there's a single performance that bothered me or more stand-offish than the others, it was pretty solid all around. I did really like John C. Reilly's character as he added some good comedic relief to this film.
Kong: Skull Island is just a joy to watch, nothing too serious, some great action, good acting all around, a pretty satisfactory story and some nice cinematography and visuals.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Kong Surprised Me,"I had a free AMC preview of the movie on March 1st, 2017. My husband is not a fan of some of the actors in this film BUT he loves KONG! So, during the movie I felt he was enjoying it. I'm not going to give away anything because I hate when people do that; all I will say is the skull crawlers gave me a nightmare and the entire movie from start to finish was really really good.The plot was good, the acting was outstanding. I really felt I was in the 70's. The music in the movie was dead on perfect.Hope you go out and support this movie because I am sick of remakes and this is NOT one of them, This movie stands alone by itself! A MUST SEE...Stay to the very end...",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Finally, a good remake...",Definitely worth watching. Storyline differs greatly but just enough to remind you it is a King Kong remake. Very good acting as Samuel L. makes it so very interesting. Ideally they would make a Part 2 for this.,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Kong would regret being in this film,"I was confused about the purpose of this film, and sadly, I was still confused after watching the film. All the elements of this new version of King Kong have been recycled. Taking parts of the originals/remakes and hastily gluing them together again in a different way doesn't mean it is going to create an inventive artwork.And I knew they would put a scene where Kong saves a pretty lady in his palm, I just knew it. All that's improved from the previous films is Kong's appearance. He is fluffier, angrier and more realistic. Some points must be given to the stunning visual effects.The characters' names and faces have also changed, but their nature and characteristics are half dimensional and predictable. It is stereotypes upon stereotypes. It is a major waste of talent with Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L Jackson and Academy Award winner Brie Larson (""Room"") struggling in the muddled chaos. You could see and feel the disappointment. Even Kong seems confused. The performances are half- hearted and there is just no substance for them to work with. I bet all they were thinking of while filming was 'get me out of here' – literally.For the majority of the film, everyone says very few words to each other. The conversations are forced and laughable. It wouldn't have made a difference if they were just silent. It's so predictable that you would know exactly what the next line would be.I thought while watching this, was this meant to be an exaggerated satire of King Kong? Or was it meant to be taken seriously? Even the execution of the film presents the same questions. At one point, it would be slow and mystic, and minutes later, overly upbeat music would hit your ears, and we are treated to magnified slow-motion action. It feels it is trying too hard to get our attention. And once it does, it doesn't know how to sustain it.And finally, there are so many extreme close-ups of Samuel L. Jackson's face, it probably took up half the film. They did it to match Kong's face, so you can imagine how gigantic it was.Maybe if Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts figured out from the beginning what type and style of film this would be, it would have been a better film. It seems like he had an idea but is unconvicted towards it, and instead keeps changing his mind to offer more 'fun'. The result that it is a jumble of various pieces that don't belong in the same puzzle.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not half bad,"""Samuel L. Jackson's character ruined this movie"" - Wellll , I'd have to say 6 outta 10 tens he usually does. But in THIS movie, he is just WAY too much. I'm sure by now he is secure for several lifetimes, so WHAT is it ? Insecurity or just Ego ? (Never turn down a thing). He is WAY over exposed by now. I'm sure most of us are very sick of his Shtick. I surely am ! But I will say - he is several notches above WIll Smith and his ruining EVERY movie now.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A GINORMOUS Popcorn Movie,"If uncaged blood matches between badass freaks of nature tickle your fancy, then Kong: Skull Island comes recommended. This second entry to the Monster-verse franchise satiates our craving for roaring action, through technical achievements and fast paced storytelling. For instance, its impressive camerawork & sound design ushers well staged chaos, capturing Kong's destructive power through crisp, captivating effects. With these, the action sequences then packs a punch, worthy of Kong's perceived supremacy. The CGI deserves its accolades & its own mention, as Skull Island's horrors are given hyper-real renders, sweetening the violence with visually convincing appeal. As for its screenplay, its approach that veers away from reliving past adaptation's annoyances was a welcome treat, shedding the overused ape & lass love story, in favor of plot pieces that elaborates Kong's significance & tragedy as protector of Skull island.Where the film stagnates is when focus is redirected from the monstrosities. Here, the mediocrity of this picture's ensemble cast stands out, with its hollow, one dimensional characters & script that misfires with unnatural one liners & failed humor. Thank goodness then for Samuel L Jackson & John C Reilly, as their characters account for the compelling madness that rivals Kong's menace, and well placed levity that offers respite from the craziness.Kong: Skull Island is then a certified popcorn movie. It solely scores points through exhilarating sequences that features Kong, rampaging against expendable characters & over sized creeps. Its scenes that feature character drama and intended comedy are then skippable nuisances, offering small-scale relevance. Half butter, half cheese please!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A good introduction of kong.,"A well done introduction of Kong to Waner's monsterverse. it has a good plot, with some flaws in the human characters, but that doesn't matter, it's a monster movie not a loved one. the human characters are better developed that Godzilla 2014, and also Kong has a good screen time.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Kong - an exciting, satisfying monster mashup","The construction of cinematic universes seems to be the new fad of commercial Hollywood, ever since the Marvel train came along with the original Iron Man and proceeded to churn out hit after universe-expanding hit. Now, we have a ""Monsters"" universe, with Kong back just a decade after Peter Jacksons (superior) rendition of the character to tie into the universe of the lacklustre Godzilla film of 2014.Fortunately Kong: Skull Island manages to feel like its own movie. What separates this new addition to the Kong mythos from all other films of its ilk is its distinctive visual aesthetic, an aesthetic I can only assume is a gargantuan love letter to Apocalypse Now. Vittorio Storaro's iconic cinematography from Coppola's classic has been reinvented in spades with state of the art CGI effects. Every two minutes or so we are treated to a breathtaking shot - mist and fog are thrillingly utilised, as well as a night scene eerily similar to the Do Long Bridge sequence of Apocalypse Now. While this is perhaps relying too much on a far, FAR, better film, it was refreshing to know that at least from a visual standpoint there were genuine artistic influences that could be discerned, the sense that the filmmaker wanted to put a new spin on the monster formula.The important thing to note is Kong and his wide array of monster peers deliver the goods. All of the action sequences are fluidly filmed, thrillingly executed, with breathtaking CGI and the help of such atmospheric cinematography as I detailed above. The monsters have real menace and bite, and they're imposing in all the right ways. Through what seems to be on location shooting, you also get a nice sense of Skull Island as a landscape, its harsh and alien nature. When the monsters attack it's always a blast.Unfortunately when they don't attack, we have to rely on the characters, and there isn't much to rely on. Lazy characterisation and archetypal ""there purely to be killed"" characters are abound, and several great actors - Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, Shea Whigham, John Goodman, Jason Mitchell, Toby Kebbell - are really shortchanged for genuine arcs and motivations. Luckily the sheer talent and likability of these actors makes up for a great deal, and when copious eye candy and monster throwdowns occur, it didn't bother me too much. Only John C Reilly and Samuel L Jackson truly stand out, and it's because their characters have genuine development and intrigue.The soundtrack felt a tad on the nose, with popular 70s tunes, including CCR and Bowie, popping in and out for little reason other than to hamfistedly evoke an era in the broadest possible way. What cannot be faulted however is the film's pacing - there is never a dull moment, with the action and tension kept admirably flowing for a tight sub 2 hour run time ( a far cry from Peter Jackson's 3 hour epic ) In all I had a fun time with Kong. It's likely to leave my memory pretty soon, but that being said it delivers in spades on what anyone would savour in a crazy big budget monster movie spectacle as this, and even with poor characterisation, its visual appeal and effects make it worthy of recommendation.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Kong: Skull Island (2017),"Kong: Skull Island When I heard that a cinematic ""Monsterverse"" was being planned, I got excited. I love giant monster films. There's something about a badass giant monster wrecking havoc that is so captivating. I think Godzilla (2014) was a bit slow and flawed from a storytelling perspective but the monster action scenes were fantastic and its really all you can ask for from a monster film. As expected its more or less the same deal with Kong: Skull Island. Its a flawed film but the monster scenes and the action is terrific.The film follows a team of people who have been hired to explore the mysterious Skull Island. What the crew do not realize is that they have disturbed a giant inhabitant of the island: King Kong. Much like with Godzilla, Kong is a bit of an antihero. There are more dangerous creatures on Skull Island and Kong is a protector against them. The main foes in the film are giant lizard-like beings that kill whatever is in their way and are at war with King Kong. Much like other monster films, humans are caught in between. For my review, I will start with all the negatives before divulging into the positives. ﻿ The characters in this film for the most part suck. They are bland, muted, unmotivated and just are there without much characterization. The ones with a bit of character (John C. Reilly) are fed uninspiring dialogue. The humorous moments are predictable and fall flat. Brie and Tom didn't have much chemistry and both characters were so bland and could have disappeared without notice. Its a relatively unknown director at the helm of this Kong film, I think he did a good job but the film would have prospered with a better script, characters, and direction. At times (not that often) the CGI looks ropy at best and its distracting (especially with the non Kong creatures).Now the positives. Every scene with Kong in it is captivating and mesmerizing. There's more of Kong in this than say Godzilla in the 2014 reboot, which is nice. You don't want to overdo the monster presence and this film just had it right. The final battle between Kong and the skull crawler was fantastic. If you love monster films and blockbuster action sequences, prepare to be on the edge of your seat. Kong took a while to get used to but overall he looked great, had great visuals, and a nice roar. The poster scene with helicopters flying at Kong against the backdrop of the setting sun was incredible.The film is flawed for sure. The human moments aren't very inspiring, its hard to connect with any of the characters, and there's a bit too many bland characters running around. However, if you are like me you are here for some epic monster v monster action and in that regard you will not be disappointed. I'm excited with the prospect of a Monsterverse. Also, stay tuned after the credits for something really great.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Really, really just terrible.","I am not a movie snob and am easily entertained, but this movie was absolutely a complete and utter joke. It felt like a 3rd grader wrote the script. It contained every single cliché imaginable, from corny Platoon/Apocalypse Now-type one-liners to ridiculous slow-motion ""sacrifice"" scenes-- all incredibly cheap, contrived and void of any depth what-so-ever.Absolutely NO PLOT-- not a single tangible, well-built contextual plot exists in this movie. John C. Reilly was the whole point of the movie-- it should be called ""King Reilly and His Adventures""-- but then again, there really weren't any adventures to talk about...The worst part of the movie was that I could absolutely not tell when the movie was supposed to be serious or a comedic parody, and folks, that's never a good sign, as it usually means the film is not good. And Samuel L. Jackson?? I think I just might use his appearance in future films as cause to not see them because he is clearly cast for his popularity and for a quick marketing boost for films that clearly need that extra kick. I am going to binge-watch King Kong (2005) with Jack Black until I can forget that I ever saw this new attempted failure to reprise Kong. Have our standards really fallen so far?? I honestly do not think there was a single frame that lasted longer than 2 seconds, I am not joking. Oh, the agony.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Great Monster Battles Make This a Must See,"Kong: Skull Island (2017)*** (out of 4)A monster hunter (John Goodman) leads an expedition onto Skull Island where they come across various monsters including the mightiest of them all: King Kong.KONG: SKULL ISLAND is an attempt to get the giant monster back onto the big screen and it was obviously trying to get everything set up for future films. Look, nothing will ever beat the original KING KONG, although I did enjoy the first remake and even films like KING KONG VS. GODZILLA. With that said, I found the Peter Jackson film to be downright terrible and when I walked into this movie I was just hoping for something better than it. Thankfully, KONG: SKULL ISLAND is much better than that as long as you turn your brain off at the door.I thought for the most part the film worked quite well. For starters, the filmmakers appeared to realize that what movie fans want are giant monsters who battle one another. You don't have to wait too long for the first glimpse of Kong and this here is a major plus. Once we reach the island is when all of the fun starts and it really goes for the throat as there's a very fun adventure on the island. I'm obviously not going to spoil everything that happens but the entire running time takes place on the island and this leads to some very fun monster battles.There's no question that the best thing about this picture are the monsters including Kong. Yes, the King Kong is CGI but he looks terrific and very realistic. I thought the entire creation was an extremely good one and the film perfectly allows you to believe that what you're seeing is real. The other monsters also look terrific and I thought the filmmakers really nailed the look of the monsters. The battle scenes are certainly a lot of fun and especially the final one where Kong must go up against something much bigger than him.As far as the cast goes, no one is spectacular but they're at least fun. Tom Hiddleston is a pretty laid back lead but he does fine. John C. Reilly and Samuel L. Jackson are both good, although they're both pretty much playing the type of character we've seen them do countless times before. Goodman is fun when he's on the screen. The only real dud is Brie Larson as the photographer. She's good in the film but I must say it's a pretty bland and boring part and especially coming after winning an Oscar for ROOM.Technically speaking the film is quite impressive and we've got a rousing score to go with everything. The plot is certainly very simple but I'm actually glad. I mean, I've never believed these types of movies need to clock in at two and a half hours. This one is just under two-hours and that's the perfect time for this type of action movie.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A serviceable, fun spring blockbuster.","I'll start off by saying I enjoyed this more than Godzilla.That's not to say I disliked Godzilla, but every time something interesting or a really cool monster moment surfaces, it kept cutting away. Godzilla delivers in the finale, but what Kong does differently is that it isn't afraid to embrace those monster moments. Right off the bat, Kong is showcased front and center and it is pleasing eye-candy.Kong: Skull Island is action-packed, and director Jordan Vogt-Roberts has a keen eye for action. Cinematographer Larry Fong and the hard working special-effects artists produce some remarkable visuals. Kong combats a squad of helicopters who are swooping in formation. Vogt-Roberts doesn't overuse the slow-motion sequences, but he uses them at the right moment in the middle of the action. It never really cheapened all of the action set- pieces, it actually enhanced the experience. Lots of great creatures too, some deadly looking lizards things, a giant octopus, a giant spider, and some pre-historic looking birds. Kong himself looked fabulous. He's obviously the misunderstood monster as he is only protecting his turf and territory. He is ginormous, bigger than ever and it makes a difference. Kudos to the VFX team, there is a sense of scale and weight to Kong and all the other creatures in the film.The actors do their job commendably. Not much is fleshed out with any of these characters to be honest, but they do bring some gravitas to the film. Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, and John Goodman do their best to make their characters believable. Jackson in particular can be compared to Col. Kurtz in Apocalypse Now. Against all logic and odds, he's obsessed with his mission. John C. Reilly provides a lot of humor into the film as he is a WWII pilot, stranded on Skull Island for almost thirty years. Some characters are really there for exposition, particularly the short, not much to do roles played by Corey Hawkins and Tian Jing.I do want to point out that I appreciated Hiddleston and Larson's relationship in the film. While not fleshed out at all, it wasn't some typical Hollywood, forced down your throat romance, rather just a mutual respect for one another. Larson's character is also involved in the action, useful at times, and not just some damsel in distress. Some of the supporting roles of the soldiers played by Jason Mitchell, Shea Whigham, and Thomas Mann aren't as expendable as one would typically expect them to be so that was a nice surprise as well.It's no secret that Legendary and WB are creating a MonsterVerse with Kong, Godzilla, and all the other Toho creatures. They've got some franchise building to do, and for corporate film making, this movie goes through the checkmarks very well. Vogt-Roberts does a good job not making it feel like a ""filler"" film to fill in the gaps, as a matter of fact it does feel like it stands on its own for the most part. He moves the story along from A to Z with a lot of eye candy action. The choice of music and the color palette he choose feels like a Vietnam/70's film. It does what it needs to do and it's a fun way to kill off two hours.Obviously stay through the credits. It's a nice tease.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,"Following the route of the 2014 reboot of Godzilla, Warner Bros and Legendary Pictures re-team to continue to expand the 'MonsterVerse' with a retelling of the iconic classic King Kong. Packed with epic action, monsters and adventure, this movie doesn't fail for the fans for Kong and Godzilla.The plot is basically straight forward and requires no brains for thinking and realism to be taken seriously; a group of Vietnam soldiers and explorers head out to the South Pacific to explore an island that may have signs of life and discovery. They find more than what they have been told with a massive and destructive gorilla that is hailed as a king, due to his presence in protecting the natives from the creatures that hunt and feed on the humans. The battle of man vs nature commences but it's not long till they discover that maybe the king is the one in need of protection.With an awesome eye on action, monsters and scale, first time director Jordan Vogt-Roberts delivers a fun ride. First fault though was the plot, there's not much originality on screen but it does carry the tones to Godzilla. Writers Dan Gilroy and Max Borenstein make the best attempt to make the story work, based on the story by John Gatins and Dan Gilroy who based it on the original film's writers from 1933.The acting from the cast, raging from Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, Samuel L Jackson, John Goodman and such is all great for this type of film. The humorous moments are from John C Reily, who gives a fun role in the adventure. Another problem though was the lack of character development, they don't seem to expand themselves fully but then again it's primary focus is on the monsters and the mythology they come from.The soundtrack, both the music score by the great Henry Jackman and the 70's themed songs from the era are all amazing. Unlike Suicide Squad, the music is used when it's needed and its not heavily frequent.Kong: Skull Island has all the right tones to make it fun, action packed and feel like a summer blockbuster type (much like Pacific Rim). Despite the lack of character development and a plot that isn't original, it makes up for it greatly with the amount of monster action and scale of the adventure on offer. Hail, King Kong! 4/5 - NickA team of explorers and soldiers travel to an uncharted island in the Pacific, unaware that they are crossing into the domain of monsters, including the mythic Kong."" The movie starts off rather quickly and you really do believe you are in the 70's. The movie captures the whole ""good old days"" feel. It never takes too long for each scene to get to the point.Within the first 20 mins you see Kong. So the good news is that this isn't another Godzilla remake where you see Godzilla for the finale 15 mins. This is Kong's Movie and you see him in action plenty throughout. Smashing helicopters, fighting with the creatures of the island etc, he's totally badass. The CGI of Kong and the creatures are quite good as well. There were times where you knew the actors were in front of a green screen, and it's so obvious in parts.The biggest problem with this film is that there is absolutely no character development or explanation what so ever. The acting was actually the weakest part of the whole film. The only 2 good actors were Samuel L. Jackson and John C. Reilly. Reilly probably had more character development than anyone else in the entire film, and Reilly really plays his part so well. He made a stupid character so memorable and great. Jackson did well with his part as well, playing the badass soldier and stops at nothing until the job is done.All in all it's a 50/50 type film. It has good elements and bad elements. If it weren't for Kong himself the film would have flopped big time. P.S. Watch until after the credits.

Kong done right,"Legendary Pictures may be setting up the greatest ""creature feature"" mash-up of all time. ""Kong Skull Island"" takes place in 1973 with a diverse group of military troops, and civilians exploring an uncharted island. This ""mission"" is approved by a Senator, and is predicated on the idea that the Soviets may explore it ""first"".It doesn't take long for the group to run into the film's real ""superstar"" the mighty Kong, and from there things begin to go south in a hurry for them.The action is very good, as a matter of fact that is why the audience bought tickets to see this thing...to watch monsters battle it out on the big screen, and to its credit this movie does not disappoint, and really delivers the goods.The acting is what you would expect from a popcorn movie, who's main character is a massive CGI Ape...fairly wooden...except for John C. Reilly, who plays a World War 2 soldier who has been one of the island's denizens, after getting shot down during a ""dogfight"" with a Japanese Soldier. The guy steals every scene he is in. Especially at the very end, which actually had me a bit misty eyed.This is exactly the type of movie that takes me back to my childhood, when Godzilla and King Kong were the undisputed ""King of the Monsters"". It looks like round 2 is coming soon, and I for one can't wait.Kong Skull Island is PG 13 mostly for CGI violence, and some pretty strong language throughout, including one ""F"" bomb. I'm glad I left my 11 year and 9 year old behind, but I for one am glad that I made a trip to Skull Island!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Jurassic Park mixed with Apocalypse Now,"Especially in the beginning before the enter the island were Kong lives this is a pure ode to Apocalyose Now (1979). The score used, the shots from the helicopters and the way the cinematography was done will remind a lot of people towards the old flicks about the Vietnam war.It's once on the island that the action really begins and it starts immediately with an apocalypse (no pun intended). The effects are stunning and it's from that point that this flick turns into a fight against the creatures on one point and another bunch of guys are trying to survive. From there on the mix between the titles said in my summary starts.But don't get me wrong. It's not a remake of King Kong (all issues). It stands on it's own and of we go in a flick full of great effects. Not a flick to watch with youngsters because when fighting against the creatures it's full of creepy suspense.Better than expectedGore 2/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Ratings are DEAD.  Bring on the next thing.,"Honestly, in today's world of people with hardly any integrity, who think ratings can be bought or sold, or who are either/or people and think that the way they feel that morning can and should be taken out on a film, without intelligently being able to process it, the rating system should no longer exist.You have the little kids with media at their fingertips, and the old have-no-lifes truly still living in mom's basement (figuratively and literally) with computers stuck to their noses, pirating films because they have nothing better to do, and thinking they are critics, when they probably can't even wipe correctly. And don't get me started on the so called serious critics.All in all, it has made for an now outdated and no longer valid system which should be folded up and incinerated since no one really would be able to fix or correct it. The Rating System, where people rate a film on its merit and its merit alone, is dead.This film for example was AMAZINGLY ENJOYABLE. No, it wasn't as noteworthy as Citizen Kane or The Birth of a Nation, but COME the HOLY FRICK ON. Are you really SUCH a dufus that you are sitting down to watch something like this expecting it to be? The same people who expect that, are the ones that go to a drive-thru expecting to buy steak on the 99-cent menu. Fools. The problem with today's society is, that there are too many of these fools, and that these fools choose to first fool themselves into thinking they aren't fools.For those of you who are not crying in their pants and are still reading (you are maybe a non-fool), go watch this movie. You can tell, from the very first scene, that the people involved in making it took the time to try and bring you (us) a quality product. For the most part, IMO, they succeeded. It is HIGHLY entertaining, the characters are interesting and mostly well-acted, there is humor, anger, the CG is fantastic ... Yes, I agree that Samuel Jackson is pretty played out and when they put him in the game, you always get the same character more or less, but even he can't detract much from KONG, who is after all, the star.Do yourself a favor. Spring for the cost of a ticket or two, take your best friend or lover and go SEE it for yourself. Unless you are hurting for $18, and you are normal, you probably won't come back cry- babying due to lost time or lost money like some of these 'raters' are doing. (Like I really believe the ones complaining actually paid to see it and saw it on the big screen as opposed to their laptop screens). You'll have a great time.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Predictable and Cliché,"The cast is the best part about this movie. The acting is solid, but every scene in this movie when focused on the Vietnam era soldiers comes off as B-Roll from the movie Apocalypse Now. With early 70's hits playing the background as the action unfolds. The CGI Kong is the best thing about this movie, but the story is somewhat tedious and some scenes look as if they were shot and edited by Michael Bay.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The best monster movies in years!,"This is probably the best monster movie I've seen it in years. IMHO it also tops the recent Godzilla movie. The final battle between Kong and Skull crawler is simply jaw dropping, and the cinematography not only in that scene but also in the entire movie is simply brilliant.Before going to the movie, please realize that you're going for a monster flick and it's not an Oscar calibre movie like Moonlight or La La Land, so critic it on that basis only. What this movie does better than Godzilla in my humble opinion is there is more human touch to it, once you see it you'll come to know what I'm talking about.Lastly, I was very pleased that this Kong movie wasn't like 1933 and the remakes. See it on the big screen with a bag of popcorn, trust me you won't be disappointed.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Kong : Skull Island delivers the thrills,"""Kong: Skull Island"" delivers a lot of thrills, but not much more than that. Working from a screenplay by Dan Gilroy (""Nightcrawler""), Derek Connolly (""Jurassic World"") and Max Borenstein, director Jordan Vogt-Roberts (""The Kings of Summer"") keeps things moving as he updates the old-fashioned adventure flick. Better yet (and unlike Jackson's film), the new movie understands the line between thrilling an audience and scaring it silly — between action-adventure awe and horror-movie gross-outs. The action and special effects are mostly first-rate and Vogt-Roberts maintains a vaguely satiric tone that sidesteps schlockiness.My Rating : 3.5/5",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A surprisingly entertaining, strange yet enjoyable film","Knowing I'm probably the last person on Earth to review this movie, I arrived at the theater intentionally avoided reading any reviews online or tweets. I did my best to come into this film blind and expected the unexpected. What I got was a strange ""Jurassic World- esque"" film with uninteresting characters, with a great cast by the way, failed attempts at comedic moments, and overall the movie just felt strange. However there is enjoyment to be had in the film. The best part of the movie is King Kong. He's big and loud. A smart ape that will fight for his territory. Also the photography is fantastic. You really feel the scope of the island.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Felt More Like a Toho Movie Which is a Good Thing!,"Kong Skull Island primarily takes place in the 1970's or more specific right after the US leaves Vietnam. A crew is sent on an expedition to survey the area for resources, but the real reason is to find proof of King Kong.Typically with the US movies we see a love story ensue with the blond and the beast as well as some money making side show. That is for the most part disregarded and instead we get a good monster fighting movie. The action was great and well shot especially during the last 20 minutes or so. That period of time really sold the movie for me. Prior to that point I was on the fence if I was really liking what I was seeing.Kong was once again the sympathetic beast audiences can root for and will continue to root for if this whole planned monster Universe goes as planned (fingers crossed). The other characters are not fully fleshed out but that is excusable since the great monster movies do not need character development. The character that was talked about the most was the comic relief and he had a great story and well timed jokes. There was certainly never a dull moment watching this as monsters just kept coming and the crew just had to survive. Speaking of the characters, Hiddleston and Larson had their moments as well. There wasn't much but there was enough to get attached to them. They had kind of a... well I don't what you call it but they reminded me a lot of Nathan Drake and Elena from Uncharted. If you don't play video games then look them up as that relationship is the best example I could give.The Bad:The big thing that annoyed me was the overly clichéd character of Samuel L Jackson I am not going to say anything about the direction his character takes but it was dumb and has been done better.Some of the action...no wait just the scene when they arrived on the helicopters yes that one. That went on too long to remain enjoyable if they cut that sequence by half I would have enjoyed it a whole lot more.ConclusionThis was a very good monster movie.I am semi excited what the next one will be given the movies success. I would recommend this if you liked the Toho movies as I believe they helped a little in making this movie. If you just like giant monsters fighting then you can't go wrong with this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Sorry, there is no king here.","King Kong (1933) was a perfect movie in its proposal. A simple, direct and clear message. No remakes or sequels required. This is why all sequels and remakes are always inferior in impact to the original. Filmmakers always want to add anything new and unnecessary.In this new film, Kong leaves the territory of quality and embarks on a trip to the territory of blockbusters, in other words, special effects and jokes (just watch the retarded and unnecessary joke scene about the Skullcrawlers name with Hiddleston, Larson and John C. Reilly) overlap the story, and so the film is passable and totally forgettable in a week.Once again, Hollywood treats scientists as idiots when the character of Corey Hawkins can not even open a can of canned food and feels intimidated by a woman. Not to mention the macho colonel, who wants an unnecessary revenge with Kong, because Kong killed his men (in a casual meeting).And not to mention the idiotic plans that Jordan Vogt-Roberts uses to focus the eyes of the Samuel L. Jackson character with the eyes of King Kong. It seems like the director Jordan Vogt-Roberts wants to make a kind of (unnecessary) fight in the old west style. Pure waste of time, as we know that the macho colonel, is no challenge for Kong, so why waste precious screen time with these situations? Because Kong's story can be told as in the original in just 90 or 100 minutes. And the filmmarkers have to put 2 hours of film and for this they have to put unnecessary situations and scenes.As the disposable soldier of the colonel, who gets lost from the group, just to see Kong crush a giant squid (and then Kong eats it), then after some scenes, be killed by another giant monster. What could be an interesting conflict between the characters of Tom Hiddleston and Samuel L. Jackson, but that ends up in nothing. Because people are written from a stupid one-dimensional way (like the stupid macho colonel). That is, more movie time, for less story. This is because Kong never leaves the island in this movie, Kong will only leave the island in 2020 in the movie Godzilla vs. King Kong. Yes this movie aims to create another shared universe (MCU type of crap), and in the end this compromises the quality of this film. The filmmakers have their hands tied, because they can not put their best on this film, however they have to think how this movie will work with another movie from another guy, three long years into the future.I went into the movie hoping to see a good and fun Kong movie, and I ended up seeing a crap and bad one, because of the ambition of the studio that compromised the quality of the movie, for the money. Not to mention, even as a fun movie, this movie fails so much.You see, the scenes with special effects, you can see that the scenes were all filmed on a green screen. And the final fight between Kong and the giant lizard is even inferior to the T-rex fights in Peter Jackson's 2005 remake. Yes, the fights and clashes between Kong and the other giants monsters were better, bigger, more epic, more brutal and vicarious than in this pathetic 2017 movie. I'm not defending the Peter Jackson movie, that film obviously had its flaws, but in the department of special effects and action scenes (this department that does not save a movie, nonetheless) is vastly superior to this Jordan Vogt- Roberts movie. Even as an action movie and blockbuster, this movie fails in a big way.But if you were disappointed, and if you were sad that you had lost money unfairly, you can wait until 2020 to see the rest of the film in Godzilla VS King Kong.My God, that's why commercial filmmaking is in the mud. The commercial cinema has as main target children, teenagers and young people. And this is why the quality bar is so low.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Kong:Skull Island(2017)Movie Review,"In the year of 1973 a group of people travell to Skull Island, with the intuit to explore the misterious place.They find themselves in life-threatnning situations thanks to the creatures inhabiting the place.
There have been many different sequels, reboots,etc about King Kong over the years.Now it´s time for Warner Brothers to add a new version to the catalogue.
Let´s start with the script, it´s decent, it works, but it´s clear that the goal it´s not to tell a compelling story, the director is more interested in the big action sequences and the entertainnment value involving the creatures, actually those action scenes are impressive, exciting, well directed and the visual effects very well done.
The cast is good mainly Samuel L.Jackson and John C.Reilly, Tom Hiddelston and Brie Larson were decent, the rest of the cast is fine.The secondary characters don´t do anything and they´re not particulary necessary for the movie.
The visual effects as a said are very good, the creatures look real, Kong looks very expressive. The cinematography also worths a nod, there are magnificent large open exterior plans of the island,the nature,the sunset and others involving saturated orange and blue colors.
Kong Skull Island doesn´t have the best of the scripts, or does it have developed characters.However it has good directing, visual effects, action sequences and cinematography.It´s a big monster movie, and is made simply to entertain.6.7/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Big dumb fun of a very high order,"On one level, Kong: Skull Island is just big, dumb fun but it's big dumb fun of a very high order. It's just one Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism (MUTO) after another and who doesn't love that? At a deeper level it offers something of a sly undermining of the war movie genre. The Apocalypse Now references are everywhere and while I certainly wouldn't put it on the same level as that masterpiece in its own way it offers a subtle critique of the military industrial complex (watch for one particular act of heroic sacrificial machismo that hopelessly backfires).The Samuel Jackson character plays Captain Ahab to Kong's Moby Dick driven by his own ego need to destroy the creature even at the risk of his crew and ultimately meeting the same fate as Ahab. When he declares that Kong will learn that 'man is king' you know that such homo sapien hubris is going to get what's coming to it (another theme that runs through the film). The original King Kong (1933) is one of my top five films of all time and in my view the perfect adventure movie Unlike many, I liked Peter Jackson's 2001 remake, but Skull Island almost betters it. It's less bloated for one thing and it has more heart, more humour, and better CGI.As in all the Kong films (none has yet improved on the original) there is the theme of rapport between the human and the simian but this time it doesn't have the erotic overtones of earlier outings where the blonde becomes a sexual fetish, the 'beauty that killed the beast.' This time its two humans who establish emotional contact with Kong with Brie Larson and Tom Hiddlestone being great in their respective roles of anti-war photographer and soldier of fortune. John C. Riley's WWII survivor offers a great comedic performance and I found the little vignette on his character at the end quite affecting.The setting in Nixon-era America is perfect and the song selections are spot on (Creedence, The Stooges, Black Sabbath, Jefferson Airplane etc.) Wait till the end of the credits for a sequel teaser. I'm not ashamed to own this self-mocking giant ape movie as a guilty pleasure.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
B-movie plot meets A-movie budget with A-list actors = One helluva Good Time,"""Kong: Skull Island"" delivers on what a B-movie monster flick with an A-movie budget should be: a well paced, action-packed, visually competent, comedic, and an all around fun time. What helps set it apart from forgettable/mediocre monster flicks like 2014's ""Godzilla"" is its large and highly entertaining cast of talented A-listers that include Samuel L. Jackson, John Goodman, Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, John C. Reilly, the reuniting of ""Straight Outta Compton's"" Corey Hawkins and Jason Mitchell, and the box office King himself, Kong.The standout is John C. Reilly whose introduction breathes new energy into the movie just as things were about to turn dull. His character provides plenty of comic relief, interesting exposition, and a surprise emotional moment. Samuel L. Jackson almost steals the show as a vengeful, trigger-happy and profane army officer who has the only logically-sound motives. Also John Goodman and Corey Hawkins play scientists out to prove the existence of Kong and monsters. Brie Larson and Tom Hiddleston have an interesting scene together in the beginning of the film but after that are kinda wasted with no real development. I had trouble remembering their names by the time the end credits rolled, but their charisma and sublime hair were enough to compensate. Jason Mitchell and Shea Whigham provided some nice banter that helped put a face on the faceless soldiers. Then there is the real star: Kong! The monster battles were visually delightful as well as inventively awesome -- like when Kong uses a propeller as a morning star. Shout out to the writers for not wasting everyone's time with a rehashed romance between Kong and the blonde damsel in distress. We had enough of that in Peter Jackson's interpretation.In conclusion, ""Kong: Skull Island"" is an entertaining ride from start to finish that will thrill/entertain/amuse those willing to turn their brains off.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Good, but typical Hollywood formula holds it back","I enjoyed this movie, but was turned-off by the typical Hollywood formula of build up story, evil person(s) emerge, evil person(s) cause all kinds of trouble, evil person(s) get their comeuppance at the end, things turn out OK for the main likable characters at the end.This movie could've been stellar if they built the story without that typical formula. Every journey and action scene could have still been scripted by having the characters face issues such as problems navigating the island, injury to members of the party, other challenges that made it difficult for the two separate groups to reconnect.Some thoughtful ingenuity when writing the scripts in these movies can make a huge difference. But they always revert to humanizing the cast by good, evil, indifferent, and build their whole story-lines around that concept.What a shame. It would have received an extra 2 or maybe 3 stars from me if not for the typical Hollywood formula.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fine monster movie,"While this certainly doesn't go the Godzilla (2014) route it certainly could've been better. The performances are all fine, there are some pretty good characters but it's a shame they get killed around halfway through.

Rousing and fun reboot of the Kong franchise,"""Kong: Skull Island"" (2017 release; 118 min.) starts a new chapter in the King Kong universe. As the movie opens, we are told it's ""South Pacific, 1943"", and a US pilot and Japanese pilot crash land on a beach, and while they are fighting each other, Kong appears out of the blue. Cue forward and now we are ""1973"" (as we see Nixon announce the withdrawal of troops from Vietnam). Bill Randa is able to get a US Senator to approve a 'mapping mission' of an unchartered island somewhere in the South Pacific. After some quick preparations, including getting a military escort, off we go to that mysterious island... To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest reboot of the King Kong franchise, more than a decade since the last one (by Peter Jackson). This time, Kong is bigger and better and 'badder' than ever before, and with lots of other monsters on the island, much to our viewing pleasure. The movie has a distinct ""Apocalypse Now"" vibe going in the first part, even more so as the herd of helicopters approaches the island and is met by Kong. Once the action shifts to the island, there is a distinct ""Jurassic Park"" vibe to it. We all know fully well that there is a lot of CGI in the movie, yet it never bothered me, and in fact I'll see that the movie feels very authentic from that perspective. The support cast is okay, with John C. Reilly (as the stranded US pilot now 30 years later) absolutely stealing the show (sorry John Goodman, Brie Larson, Tom Hiddleston, et al.). There is a terrific score to the movie, courtesy of veteran composer Henry Jackman, and there are also a ton of song placements (Black Sabbath's ""Paranoid"", CCR's ""Run Through the Jungle"", etc.). BEWARE: this movie is rated PG-13 for a reason, as there are some frightening scenes that I believe are inappropriate for kids under the age of 10 or thereabouts.""Kong: Skull Island"" opened wide this past weekend. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was sold out to the very last seat. The audience LOVED this movie, and gave it an applause when the end titles started rolling. ""Kong: Skull Island"" is nothing short of a rounding and fun reboot of the Kong franchise. I can't wait to see the next installment (reportedly due for 2019). ""Kong: Skull Island"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Action-packed, intelligent and undeniably entertaining","After the crushing disappointment that was Godzilla, I have to say that Kong: Skull Island is a tremendous surprise. Not only a hugely entertaining monster movie, but a well-directed, well-written and well-acted film full of ideas from start to finish. Its action set- pieces are utterly spectacular, the CGI is fantastic, and there's even a story that's genuinely interesting throughout, something that I definitely didn't expect going in.But by far the greatest achievement of this film is the presence of Kong himself. As plain as most of the film was, the biggest issue with Godzilla was that there just wasn't enough Godzilla. Fortunately, Skull Island rectifies that exact problem, and makes Kong as big a character in the film as any of the humans, appearing on screen at regular intervals, and actually playing a genuine role in the story.And that story is probably the thing that surprised me most of all. Again, Godzilla was a slow, empty and formulaic monster movie that really bored me. Kong: Skull Island, on the other hand, is a fast- paced and absolutely jam-packed action movie that actually gets better and better as it moves along.Of course, there's a part of me that's a little sad that we're not getting the classic story of King Kong that made both the 1933 and 2005 films so beautiful. However, Skull Island does do a fantastic job at bringing the character to a different time period and making a new, riveting story.Above all, the film's ingenious parallels with the Vietnam War make for fascinating viewing. Bringing a different dynamic to the relationship between the humans and Kong, the way that Skull Island looks at the story through the lens of the anti-Vietnam War sentiment of the 1970s adds an impressive layer of depth to the story, keeping Kong an interesting and emotionally resonant character despite removing his love with Ann Darrow.What's more is that some of the film's characters have some very layered and interesting backstories. In particular, Samuel L. Jackson's character, a stubborn, war-mongering colonel taken from the Vietnam War he loved fighting in, is hugely interesting to watch. At times mimicking the role of film director Carl Denham from the original, at others adding a far darker and more serious edge to the story of the invasion of Skull Island, he's absolutely fascinating to follow from start to finish.There are a whole host of other characters that bring some impressive depth to the story, depth that I certainly didn't expect after the two-dimensional heroes of Godzilla, and make the film's large ensemble cast work amazingly well.One more positive from the film is undoubtedly the action. As I said, this is a very exciting monster movie that's full of action throughout. Above all, the opening and closing action sequences really stand out. Both because of the amazing visual parallels drawn with Vietnam War films like Apocalypse Now, Platoon and Full Metal Jacket, but also thanks to the stunning CGI that allows Kong to tower over the screen in comparison to the humans, but also puts a formidable and genuinely terrifying enemy on a very level playing field.As far as blockbusters go, Skull Island is top-quality, but it still isn't entirely perfect. For one, whilst it's brimmed with ideas and interesting characters throughout, that does lead the film to becoming a little crowded at times. The lack of a main character amidst the huge ensemble cast means it's definitely not as streamlined as I would have liked.Also, the parallels with Vietnam, whilst unique and great to see in a movie like this, are a little overbearing at times. Particularly in the first act, there comes a point where the film really hits you over the head with how similar it is to Apocalypse Now, and although that does die down to a better level later on, it's a little frustrating at times.Simply put, Skull Island is an impressively brainy and innovative blockbuster, but it goes a little too far with everything it does. That's far better than a completely empty film like Godzilla, but with an enormous main cast and a story that's so jam-packed, I felt like things could have been carried out a little smoother than the finished product.Still, I had a really good time with Kong: Skull Island. It's a massively entertaining monster movie that places its title character right in the thick of the action, surrounded by more interesting human characters, excellent visuals, stunning action sequences, and a genuinely engrossing and intelligent original story.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
cool monster movie,"I thought this move was pretty good, mainly because of the great special effects. Kong looks great, he looks real, the skull crawlers were good and the giant buffalo. The story was pretty basic. Investors hire army guys to go to a hidden island for research but in reality it is to prove the existence of monsters. They anger Kong, so he kills some of the men and commander wants revenge. Some of the others realize Kong is of importance to the island after meeting a long lost WWII soldier. So you have the final battle between evil commander, good guys and Kong and of course the evilest beast on the island thrown in.FINAL VERDICT: Lots of cool special effects. It's eye candy, so IMO worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Well produced, great cast, bad plot","I just hate when a movie's plotline is so avoidable. Everything that unfolded in the main plot could have been completed avoided. So the conflict was just made up to have conflict, and that feels disingenuous to storytelling for me. Yes this is meant to be a bashing, crashing, CGI action movie, but it still needs to make sense why it's happening. Even as someone who is a self proclaimed tree-hugger the obviousness of the film's agenda was maddening because everything about it was so overt. It just didn't make sense and that drove me nuts throughout.The production value was great, CGI was convincing, and I loved the cast. I thought they all did well and played the parts as they were written very well, too. The action sequences also packed a massive punch. Those aspects are why it gets 5 stars from me.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A great blockbuster,"This film tells the story of a team of scientists and army personnel, who head off to a remote and uncharted Pacific island for a cartographical expedition. Little do they know, that monstrous lifeforms are waiting for them on the unexplored island.I didn't think I would enjoy ""Kong: Skull Island"" so much! The story is very engaging because of the constant unknowns. The characters are divided into good and bad, while monsters are also likewise divided. This quadratic division gives characters a clear personality, and what the character represent. The visual effects are really good, as there is just no way that you can tell that the island and it's unusual creatures are computer generated. The credit scene touches me to tears. The post credit scene is comparatively long, and is worth staying for. I think this is a great blockbuster.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Kong is back,"By the setting Kong : Skull island in the 1973 the film gets to dovetail the aftermath of the Vietnam conflict onto the plot.The film begins with William Randa (John Goodman) and Houston Brooks (Corey Hawkins) trying to get government funding for an expedition to the unknown Skull Island who they have satellite images of for the first time. They recruit a former British special ops James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) as a guide and photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson) for the expedition.Lt Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson) and his team of soldiers are the military escort. Packard is upset with the withdrawal of troops from Vietnam leading what the fighting was for and what to do afterwards. This mission gives him purpose but as they arrive in their helicopters to Skull Island and start dropping bombs as part of scientific tests, they are attacked by the giant Kong who destroys the choppers and kills most of the men. Packard wants vengeance against Kong.Meanwhile Conrad and Weaver discover Hank Marlow (John C Reilly) a soldier from World War 2 who crash landed and resides with the natives in the island. Marlow explains that Kong is regarded as a god by the natives and he is their protector as the island has other monsters especially those underground that only Kong can take on.Kong: Skull Island neatly reworks elements of the King Kong story. We have the helicopter attack at the early part of the story leading to Packard becoming a sworn enemy of Kong. Of course Packard is crazy whose motivations are nonsense. It was he and his men who have invaded Kong's turf and started bombing it which has awaken the underground monsters. You get some mumbo jumbo about superiority of men while they are being killed by giant spiders and lizard creatures.It is an entertaining action adventure with a ludicrous story. At least you root for Kong and he does keep the story going. The special effects are very good and you gets all sorts of nasty creatures in the island which again is a call back to the original King Kong.The film really is unsure what to do with some of the leads. Larson is only there to be the tentative love interest to Hiddleston and bring out Kong's tender side. At least she fares better than the Chinese actress Tian Jing who as the other female is there just to keep the Chinese co-producers happy, she certainly has little to do in this film. Even Hiddleston's action man role is curtailed somewhat.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A mishmash of extravagant themes, flashy tone, and some top notch set pieces","Watching the new version of Kong yesterday felt like riding a crazy over-the-top roller coaster without fastening seat belts, and it took me some time to recover from the dizziness.The movie is soaked in style, and very entertaining; it's not what you're expecting from a prototypical blockbuster creature feature, but instead, it's a mishmash of extravagant themes, flashy tone, and some top-notch set pieces.What cheered me the most was how they handled the coloration and cinematography. All those irrational close-ups of Richard Nixon's crazily-moving head doll, the reflection of some massive explosion on a pair of shiny sunglasses resting on a soldier's smiling face, the brief shot of the clapping monkey, the rough cuts, the surprises, and the overall surreal tone. Some may see this as an absurdity, but not me. Tastes vary.This movie intended to be a pure action spectacle, take it for what it is.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A blockbuster monsters movie & thrilling adventure,"So I guess my review is the 2nd Vietnamese review on here so far. Yes! It's my country-Vietnam which on-screen in 70% of the film duration with the magnificent view from Ha Long bay, Ninh Binh & Quang Binh. During the 1 month countdown to the premiere, the present and advertising hit the mass media in my country so hard that almost everyday. I actually pay attention to this movie about 2 years ago when it only a 2017 title on IMDb , before the whole Hollywood crews start filming The movie take the audience back to the 1973 in the withdraw of US Army from the Vietnam war. The start look promising, the battle between the Sky Devils fleet and Kong definitely get you edge of your seat( strongly recommend the Dolby Atmos sound and 2D only for better experience-just my opinion). The film then catch-up with gripping, fast-paced and appear to be little low on plot. The iconic Kong of all time now is the king of skull island and look great than ever. The giant buffalo and the view of endless field, the village & the splendid beauty of Ha Long gain my respect more than ever. The fight in the dead valley is quite cinematic and heroic with Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L. Jackson came to the crash-site with full of revenge and would do anything just to take out Kong. I understand the whole fleet lost put him to this point but really deep in his mind is a soldier cant leave the war. There many funny dialogue between Marlow & Brooks, Mills and Cole (the impressive one with the AK47) which made the audience laughing over and over. The final fight is so impressive and full of tension, Kong vs the big one Skull Crawler. Kong Skull Island is a highly recommend movie for everyone with just some negative argument for the plot and the character development. On the other hand the movie is great, well direct by Jordan Vogt- Roberts with the A-line cast, outstanding graphics, awesome Kong and open up the Monster universe in the after credit. The director announce with the public to came living in Ho Chi Minh city because he love Vietnam and want to make more great movies here-that gains another respect from me. In the end, the movie will bring all the goods, beauty of Vietnam nature to the world.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Good,"KONG: THE SKULL ISLANDThe story goes back in 1973, when some scientists go to a deserted island to unmask the strange happenings that happen on the island.Let's start with the actors. Tom Hiddleston seemed very good in his role, I found the character a little lively. Brie Larson was the most x of the actors, their interpretation did not strengthen the film, but neither is bad. The actor that I liked a lot is John C. Reilly, like crazy, with sanity, that has been more than 30 years in the island next to the natives. John Goodman is the one presenting the plan to the government to investigate the island. The strange thing about all this is that he knew there were strange things on the island. Why did he try so hard for many people to die? And Samuel L. Jackson seemed like the typical villain of the movie that wants to kill the monkey, a villain that works well.And here come the bad things ... The initials 30 minutes found them exhausting, very boring. The leadership of the characters seemed very poor, Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson are for more ...But all that I forget after seeing the effects of this movie, the action scenes and the design of ... of ... those things.8/10 Good",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hollywood is committing suicide,"They are pushing so many sequels, prequels, reboots and offshoots that the cash-in is going to make Hollywood collapse unto itself. Who needs any more reboots?? One more X-Men and the world shall vomit unto itself. I have the remedy for what ails Hollywood though: Go to Unoriginality Anonymous meetings and force yourself to try to write an original script People should boycott all these nefarious cash-ins Ban JJ Abrams from anywhere near Los Angeles (and his ilk) No more Morgan Freeman either Give Samuel Jackson an integrity infusion etcAs for this film: A group of cash whore actors gather in a film studio to parody the original dignified metaphor that was King Kong. The actors make jokes that are hilariously funny. Then they run away and ambush and attack Jurassic style. Then they go somewhere and there are a lot of explosions. The enemies are ugly, and they also fight each other, so it's OK to kill them. After two hours the film ends. The film is marketed to kiddies, kiddies-in-brain and China (via the token Chinese eye candy or in this case plain vanilla useless whatever..)Did you hear? Kong called his agent in New York City, USA at the Empire State Building to ask his images be erased from this turkey and demand that his agent get him better work going forward. The agent wouldn't take his call however. How could he? He didn't recognize the caller. That isn't King Kong after all.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Turn your brain off and enjoy the ride,"Kong:Skull Island is the second movie in a new rebooted Universal monsters universe, the first being Godzilla (2014). I loved Godzilla and I think I loved this one even more.Everyone says that the movie is bad because most characters are one-dimensional and you don't care about them. That's true. But look, why would you want to know all of the human characters backstories and feelings when you're watching a freaking monster movie? People today are forgetting how to enjoy movies. Not everything should be watched by the same standards. It's kinda like criticizing Moonlight for not being funny and you decided to watch it as a comedy. Think about it, there's really not much difference. Unfortunately, it's starting to look like every movie today is being criticized for not being funny, but whatever. The characters might have been bland, but that doesn't make the movie any less intense. And trust me, it's INTENSE. There are quite a few scenes that will make you anxious especially if you're afraid of bugs or lizards. It's also surprisingly very gory for a PG-13 movie. I was very pleasantly surprised. It's not the PG- 13 ""violence"" that you see in movies all the time lately. This movie is shockingly brutal and one of those that push the PG-13 rating to the limits. And Kong. Wow. Kong has never been this bada$$. Seriously, he's so freaking cool and the design of other monsters is quite good.All in all, when I put it all together, I suggest that you turn your brain off and let yourself be entertained. If you like movies about giant monsters, you will love this.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This is a BLAST!,"I really had no high hopes for this as I ventured inside the cinema, but surprise surprise, I came out with a bounce in my step and if nobody were around I would have beat my chest and roared.Kong is the second movie in the MonsterVerse series, following Godzilla (2014). The latter is a bit of a disappointment – the monster element is fine, its height used to great advantage and the huge vistas of mayhem and destruction is a young kid's wet dream. However, I couldn't wrap my head around the heavy-handed and joyless storytelling. The human component felt neglected; they barely registered a presence beyond the crazy one, the screaming one, the gung-ho one, the running one, the brooding scientist whom no one bothers with but still keeps around for some alternative voice. I find all the big-name actors very cardboard-y and lifeless. It also didn't help that the story is so fatiguing with so much overbearing self-importance. Fast-forward to 2017's Kong, I would love to say the filmmakers have learned from their predecessor, but in all honesty I can't. However, Kong is a lot more entertaining than Godzilla and for a B-grade movie it embraces its shortcomings with finesse. This is a blast!Kong has the right blend of silly humour and all-out monster action. Yes, the human characters still feel hollow, the exposition can be clunky and the story is unoriginal and riffs off Francis Ford Coppola's sublime Apocalypse Now, but it is plain dumb to expect the ensemble cast and screenplay to hold up during award season. What this is is a good ole pulsating monster mash of fun. There is a wee bit pressing of genre refresh button in that Kong doesn't fall for a white woman which will lead to his downfall and the sandbox playground is no longer a skyscraper city but Kong's Eden home ground, which is home to a multitude of humongous creatures. It is getting increasingly tiresome to see another city getting devastated, so it is refreshing to see a straight-up survival movie on an island where the human beings aren't on top of the food chain. The star is definitely the lonely God, Kong and the rest of crazy inhabitants of Skull Island. The visual and sound effects are stellar, and most importantly, the action doesn't feel repetitive. Each time Kong goes mano a mano against another monster, there isn't that dreaded been-there-done-that feeling. My fave is definitely Kong having an octopus sashimi for lunch; definitely won't be forgetting that for a while, especially when I am chewing on a tangy squid or octopus.The impressive ensemble cast plays second fiddle to Kong and his monster ""friends"", and they seldom rise up beyond a distinctive character trait. Tom Hiddleston as John Conrad has to be some kind of convenient homage to Joseph Conrad whose Heart of Darkness is obviously an inspiration. Brie Larson, after her award-winning turn in Room, shows off different levels of seriousness. Samuel L. Jackson almost had time to utter his famous muthafcuking line. John Goodman plays a corporation type with affable charm. John C. Reilly obviously had the most fun playing a WWII pilot marooned on Skull Island for decades. Then we get a myriad of soldiers playing fodder and meals for the inhabitants of the island. This being a partially financed movie by China, we also get a completely disposal China actress doing ""I don't know what"". Sure, the complete cast doesn't get much of a chance to shine, but they are definitely colourful and not bogged down by an overly important story.Remember to hang back for a post-credit sequence that entices a neat future prospect. After that you can stand up and beat your chest with animalistic confidence and shout ""All hail the King!""",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"No Awe, No Characters We Care About","I love a big, dumb monster movie. This is not one.The 1995 movie ""Congo"" was 100% better than this. The action was nuts, and the characters were over-the-top clichés, but they were fun.""Kong: Skull"" lacks both characters we care about and a sense of awe.There's Tom Hiddleston... playing Tom Hiddleston as a lightweight Indiana Jones (we're never given any reason to care for him, apart from the fact that he beats some guys up). There's the girl from ""Room,"" looking lost as a photographer. There's Nucky Thompson's brother, as a faux Vietnam soldier. There's a Chinese actress, who may be the worst case ever of being a token character there to only appease Chinese audiences.As for the action, maybe I've become jaded with the prevalence of CGI, but... a gigantic gorilla fighting helicopters and skull-monsters should be exciting... but it barely elicits a reaction.John C. Reilly is the highlight here, and could have fit into ""Congo"" nicely, but- overall- it's too little too late.**/*****",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pure mindless entertainment,John C. Reilly is the big star of this movie. Everyone else is supporting. This is a must see in 3D movie to appreciate the special effects which are right on par with what is expected these days.

"Lean, Mean and Very Much a Machine","Kong: Skull Island is as much a competently made thrill ride as it is a wild, haphazardly assembled Frankenstein's monster. It scares, it excites, it occasionally cajoles a laugh or two; it also frustrates and bewilders. Through it all it stays true to the original 1976 version, or at least true-ish enough to its surface level spirit. Wait, you're telling me there was a 1933 version that wasn't as unabashedly splashy? Say it ain't so! Set in 1973, Kong tells the desperate story of a group of scientists, soldiers and inter-governmental flunkies trying to survive a few days on the film's titular island. Initially lined-up as a geology expedition, Lieutenant, Preston Packard (Jackson), Tracker, James Conrad (Hiddleston) and Photographer, Mason Weaver (Larson) lead a pack of expendables through thick vegetation loaded with freakish monsters, defiant locals and John C. Reilly. They of course have plenty of run-ins with the island's solitary king, painting a picture of the giant ape as both a gentle giant and a force to be reckoned with.Here's the thing about seeing something like this on the big screen...again: We already know there's only so much you can do with a creature like Kong. Taken to the absolute basics, we know the structure of the film is going to be a row of dwindling meat sacks being picked off one-by-one while Kong stops the show to kick some butt and then retreat into the forest to lick his wounds. Admittedly, Skull Island does a better job than most, dressing up what amounts to a final destination gambling pool. But considering the piddly character arcs doled out in this film, we never get as invested in them as we should.The slow-burning, Peter Jackson King Kong (2005) compensated by turning Kong into an actual living, breathing character. The stop-motion work of Andy Serkis combined with Naomi Watts' Watt-ness, gave the giant ape a child-like innocence that audiences at the time found endearing. This version on the other hand turns Kong into a gritty, unforgiving force of nature motivated by ferocious anger and primordial fear. Thus what we have is a movie that intuitively lacks investment, shoots itself in the foot when it comes to the monster, and leans a bit too heavily on its Vietnam War allegory to carry the day.So Skull Island basically amounts to being a pit stop on yet another tent pole extended universe. It's awash in intricate world-building detail and inner-movie lore that will no doubt be erased or re-framed as the new installment comes clomping in. Whether you like it or not, you basically running a marathon now.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Exciting but weird end,"Exciting movie with really good action sequences. The way Mason and Kong connected was believable and Tom Hiddleston was excellent in the lead role. The opening build up was strong and so were the scenes when the characters arrive on Skull Island but you don't get much of an idea about the key characters - that is not the fault of the actors, but rather because the script does't bother to explain much about their motivations. All you get is surface. The film lost energy as the story developed and because of that it felt too long.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An edge of the seat action monster flick!,"Kong: Skull Island is about a team of scientists and soldiers who went on to explore an uncharted island. Little did they know that they are trespassing into the territory of the Kong, the King of Skull Island. Also, the island is filled with many mythical creatures, hidden from the rest of the world. Now, the team must fight to escape the wrath of these creatures. The movie is directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts, known for 'The Kings of Summer', and starring a stunning cast including Samuel L. Jackson, Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson and John C. Reilly.The special effects team is the one to give credit for the success of the film. The movie starts with a bang and ends with a bang. Everyone of the action sequence, whether it be the introduction scene of Kong or the final fight between Kong and 'Skull Crawler', are so created so well that it develops, and maintains the thrill throughout the movie. The film is well paced. Character build up is concise as we were not there to know about a bunch of soldiers or scientists were we? We went to the theaters to watch the Kong, the mighty monster. We wanted him to throw things, to smash something, to kill and that is what the movie makers understood while making the film. They introduced Kong early and gave him ample extent of screen time. I saw many from the audience screaming in enthusiasm every time Kong appeared on screen. I guess the character has gained a decent amount of fan following. There were a lot many scenes involving different mythical monsters which added to the excitement.Apart from the constant edge of the seat action, two other things which I liked were the location and the soundtrack. The film is set in the era of 1970s, right after the Vietnam War. So, its soundtrack gave a feel of the 70s with songs by David Bowie, Iggy Pop etc. If we talk about acting, well, there was not much need of special efforts to be put in this department. If I have to mention someone I would say that I really like the character Hank Marlow, played by John C. Reilly. He was responsible of providing half the humor the movie has. All the other just added to the star value of the film.I can confidently say that the film fits into the pattern of a well- executed monster movie. Compared to the one which came in 2005, this one definitely has much more to offer, but I still can't choose if you ask me which one is better. But what I can tell you is that this one is going to be a part of something bigger, so make sure you watch this, and the 2014 Godzilla movie. Legendary films have recruited writers to create a monster universe (A Mosterverse!) including Godzilla and King Kong, how cool is that right!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A worthy reboot! Gigantic action!,"The skull island is the birthplace of dozens of dangerous creatures of gigantic proportions; Huge spiders, giant killer ants, ridiculously large cows, monstrous 80 meter long lizards and of course King Kong.I come to review this movie as a fan of the action and giant monsters, since I have admired every detail in the fiction of giant Japanese and American monsters, of course, the king of kings in this case is Godzilla, but the title of king who Kong carries on his behalf is not just by coincidence.Without a doubt, this giant monkey is ready for all kinds of fantastic combat with unique scenes in the giant monster cinema.Unlike Godzilla of 2014, Skull Island has lots of monsters fighting scenes and many little details of how huge the Monsterverse is looming at us. Enter the cinema very excited about this movie and I must admit that I love King Kong.But not every movie is free from sin. What I do not like is the fact of the not-so-special script and the not-so-good performances from two great actors who wait a lot more, Jackson and Goodman. Their names are supposed to mean ""incredible scenes of script and pure acting"" but I think this was not their case with Skull Island, because of these errors, sometimes the film became too predictable and even childish at certain times , But even so, if you want entertainment, this is just right.A deserved 7 for Kong.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
He's back...only just,"This review of Kong: Skull Island is spoiler free*** (3/5)LIKE HIS Japanese counterpart, King Kong has entered the world of cinema, left it and been resurrected an uncanny amount of times, however only a few of them explored the inner reaches of his uncharted home the mythical Skull Island. But it's been over a decade since he was last brought to life, and although 2005s King Kong did go to the island it didn't explore it the way we would have liked, it had the plot to find Kong and capture him to show him to the world and then he raided New York, you know it. In Kong: Skull Island we explore the inner reaches of the island, and are constantly threatened by the giant beast, for which Samuel L. Jackson's war-hammered soldier here asks ""How big is it? How fast is it? And what it do?""Of course how big he is and how he is, is obvious to those who are familiar with the monster, his speeds vary through different films. Yet with the advantages of CGI only coming in before 2005s version he went as fast as the computer would take him, although in that version he was played by Andy Serkis in motion capture. Here he's only seen in CGI visuals roaring from sound effects, and looking more dazzlingly like an ape than ever. His facial features looking more real, and his height even more terrifying here he's about the size of other monsters beside him.This is the second film in Legendary Entertainment's MonsterVerse series; the first was 2014s Godzilla directed by Gareth Edwards, who thanks to his special effects team made the beast look more real than it ever did, but also gave him extra height, it's too hard to imagine how big they'll in their next fight. Although now Kong is noticeably smaller (at around 104 meters) but he's still growing as the film tells us but he can still pack one hell of a punch when he needs to. Were as Godzilla is full sized, he probably has the advantage over the giant ape but we won't know until the next film Godzilla: The King of Monsters comes out. But for now Kong: Skull Island makes its debut reigning supreme on his home turf, where it's dangerous by day but even more dangerous by night, as a lot of the island's inhabitants are there to kill its human invaders. Some more terrifying than others.Next to Kong, on the island there are some horrific looking beasts with nasty teeth, really quite dinosaur looking, some can fly, some have horns and giant some are creepy crawlers, as the humans soon find out. However they don't help Kong, he isn't the most dangerous, and he's the protector of the island's native human inhabitants. There is something trying to kill him, in addition there is emotional heft to this story, too when it explains that Kong is the last of his kind proving to Jackson's hardened soldier that animals, even giant ones have feelings too, and he has the feeling of anger when the unwanted guests try to destroy his home, there is a gorgeous shot of the primate's fist colliding with the helicopters that he's scared of. Of course he has to be scared of something.On land, the human invaders recover from the attack here Jackson angrier than ever, decides that Kong is the threat and wants to fight against him, but others try to get him change his mind about the war. The group of men and women include: Tom Huddleston's hardened tracker James Conrad, who hired by Bill Randa (Goodman) explores the island in search for evidence as to why evolution comes to an end, he lists the ways they are going to die on an uncharted island leaving one specific note (the giant monsters). Brie Larson's anti-war photographer Mason Weaver she takes an immediate liking to Kong and wonders why the other creatures want to kill him, and end the human territories on the island. Later, they meet with Hank Marlow (Reilly), a World War II soldier who's been stranded on the island since 1944 he steals the show from the rest of the players. Unfortunately he's the only one with character in the film, the rest of the characters are bland, even a talented actor like Hiddleston is wasted here. Sure he makes a decent impact with his bad-ass moments in a bar fight and sword swinging through dinosaur birds but it's not much.This is perhaps the main flaw of the film, granted it looks gorgeous but the characters are dreary with a non-characterizing screenplay, yes there are flaws but there goodness here, too, the action is stunning it's the monsters that have the bigger impact, or in Kong's case has the bigger punch. When goes to punch helicopter of the sky it looks gorgeous as he's surrounded by smoke and fire. In the third act the action hits its peak, when he has to fight a giant creature that matches him to save the humans. Despite the horrendous flaws, like the bland screenplay Kong: Skull Island is a jaunty film with goodness and although it's not the best monster film it's still enjoyable, let's see how far he'll go in the future.VERDICT: King Kong is alive again! Only just, in this derivative, dumb but consistently fun latest addition to the MonsterVerse series. It's just about over the line of Godzilla's strength, but not by much.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Although I do believe Peter Jackson's King Kong is one of the few great remakes that have been made, a part of me always wished they would just skip the first hour on the boat and spend the rest of the movie exploring Kong's world called Skull Island. Rising director Jordan Vogt-Roberts definitely delivers on that. He presents an ecosystem of giant creatures that stands apart visually from other monster movies like Jurassic Park. And it shows Kong less as a misunderstood monster but more as protective figure in this new mythology.When the director described this new King Kong as a god he really wasn't under-selling it. Kong has never been more intimidated and powerful then ever. He is re-imagined to be more then just an animal and monster but as this powerful force of nature that is both ferocious and benevolent. He felt like a combination of the Marvel's Hulk and Planet of the Apes's Caesar. By removing the beauty and the beast story, Kong is explored more as a character with almost sentient qualities and we see what his existence is like on the island. His best moments range from him taking out helicopters with his fists during his big reveal to when he is just sitting around and killing time with stunning visual effects that rival what was done in the 2005 remake. And the island itself is presented as a character with always having unique ways to reveal the other creatures that hide within Kong's kingdom in suspenseful and surprising ways. The creatures are both beautiful and scary as they feel like they're one with the landscapes. I could watch a whole nature documentary on this fictional world. The most terrifying out of all of them are the Skullcrawlers. If Kong is a god then the Skullcrawlers are the island's demons. They felt like a combination of the creatures from Jurassic Park, Aliens and Bong Joon Ho's The Host. They really made up this great threat to both the humans and the island in new and surprising ways.Jordan Vogt-Roberts uses a fresh way to show the action and visuals in this big-budget movie. While Gareth Edwards's visual style in Godzilla felt similar to Steven Spielberg and Christopher Nolan, Vogt-Roberts is closer to that of Zack Snyder, Edgar Wright and Guillermo Del Torro. The action and editing is very energetic and quick with warm vibrant, colour tones. When he shoots action you feel like you are suddenly thrown into the middle of it with amazing slow-motion shots to help you process the destruction and detail you are seeing. This movie has some of the most gorgeous cinematography I have seen in a monster film thanks to DP Larry Fong. The beautiful and exotic real-like locations give Skull Island an extra sense of depth and believability. The Vietnam locations like a Ninh Binh and Hao Long Bay make me believe they could actually hide 100-foot creatures. The monster fights are very brutal and feel very much like a Ray Harryhausen movie where there are long shots that stay on the titanic creatures brawling with each other. The final battle is unique enough to stand apart from the dinosaur fight in 2005 as it shows Kong's intelligence being used in battle in order to challenge the Skullcrawler's agile and nimble movements. The end of that fight makes breaking a T.Rex's jaw look tame by comparison.What unfortunately holds this movie back from being great is the human narrative. I wouldn't say it's terrible but there is nothing special either. The list of big-name actors injects some personality into it but what you get with most of the characters is just what's on the surface and nothing more. Tom Hiddleston is similar to Aaron-Taylor Johnson in Godzilla where he was just there as a plot device to get from point A to B. Sam Jackson's military leader is uniquely written and has justifiable reasons for wanting to kill Kong but still feels like other roles he has played before. Corey Hawkins and Jing Tian only really exist to setup universe building. Out of all the human characters John C. Reily was the only one I was truly invested in and felt like he matched the movie's stylized surreal tone. Got a kooky Tom Hanks Cast Away vibe from him. His crazy personality and backstory is what kept me going through the scenes without any monsters. His scenes of exposition could have been handled poorly but work when he is delivering them with some well-time jokes. Brie Larson's role in this is not going to measure up to her Oscar-winning Room performance but at least she isn't portrayed as a useless damsel like in most monster movies. I did also enjoy the dynamic between Jason Mitchell and Shea Whigham surprisingly. In Godzilla, the movie felt subtle about giant monsters rising from the earth being served as a metaphor for our over-reliance on nuclear power and lack of control on nature. Skull Island's thematic messaging about military power invading native lands like Vietnam felt more forced and didn't leave as much of an impact on.Overall, I would say that Peter Jackson's remake has a stronger emotional story with more depth but Vogt-Roberts delivers a King Kong movie that is simple, and more unique. Similar to Pacific Rim, the humans serve more as a way for us to explore this world of giant monsters then be emotional centre piece. The movie knows when to inject fun, humour and energy when it needs to and doesn't become too reliant on these characters that can't carry the movie without having a giant monster on screen. I definitely look forward to seeing this new Kong take on Godzilla in 2019. Also I got child-like excitement when I saw the after-credits scene for Godzilla: King of the Monsters.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Don't bother with this turkey even if you love King Kong,"Peter Jackson headed up a well-done remake of King Kong back in 2005. Better to rewatch Jackson's version as this new movie, Skull Island"", has little to offer even in the way of entertainment. Kong himself shows little personality and the rest of the cast, try as they might, cannot rescue the awful script, the lack of characterization, and the absence of intelligent dialogue that mark this movie. Fortunately the theater seat was quite comfortable so I could doze off as this hideous reworking of the King Kong legend unfolded. Do yourself a favor and if you must see it, wait till it comes to television.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Let's not drag this out...,"The script of the movie is roughly 3 pages long, so I guess it doesn't really deserve a long review either.First of all: this is for all intents and purposes just a flashy, very long trailer... Neat camera tricks, cheesy lines, explosions, you name it!Secondly: during the pitch meeting of this ""concept"" (at best) they probably said: we need ""a handsome mysterious type"" (cue: Hiddlestone), ""a busty blonde who doesn't really need to be there"" (cue: Larson), a crazy bearded goofy guy with morals (cue: Reilly) and an angry Samuel L. Jackson to say the word ""mutha****"" every now and again. Then we pile on some other generic, pointless characters, a whole bunch of monsters and put King Kong in the middle. 2 hour run-time? Yeah! Case closed! Lunch!So, yeah, what YOU need to know, as an audience member, is this: there is no plot, no purpose, no reason, no subtleties, no nuance, no meaning... It's just a big stinking pile of clichés!They literally could've chosen any random aspiring screenwriter of the street, and just by being awake for the meeting, those guys could've come up with ideas on how to turn this story into a half-decent script, or at least something that resembles a script.Garbage... Complete and utter garbage.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Kong: A Monster Movie that Delivers on the Monster,"The most positive thing I can say is that Kong is in this movie a lot and he actually looks good. If Kong didn't look good then this movie would fail on a lot of other factors I'll talk about later. Much like the 1933 version, Kong walks generally on his hind legs as to not be a traditional silverback gorilla or a ""giant monkey."" The titular character also THROWSDOWN. The fights with Kong are truly entertaining to watch and they are diffidently the selling points. Unfortunately, the ""Skull Crawlers"" do look exceedingly generic with no personality at all.
Next on sight is the human characters and they are not fun at all. The three main characters, Conrad, Packard and Mason, have just about nothing in common a nd little to do with each other. None of them grow as people or really learn a lesson. Packard descends into a type of madness but it's actually justified in a sense and that's really the only type of growth these characters see. John Goodman's character serves as exposition and exposition and really feels like a waste of talent. In fact, all of the talent is wasted in this movie. I will say John C. Reilly is fun to watch and delivers some emotional weight that I haven't seen from him before.
The set design and soundtrack is superb, however. A lot of the music is being played ""in movie"" and personally, that's a definite plus. The scenery is absolutely goregous and they use a lot what I'm going to call perspective art that I found really cool.
To sum it up, this movie has definite problems, but then Kong appears and it works out. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Kong approved,"Fun movie with lots of good names, Larson & Hiddleston played their roles great.

"Visually stunning! Music, effects create amazing spectacle.","Whenever I have people over to show them my surroundsound system I always play a scene from this film. It's the scene when the helicopters first arrive to the island. Plenty of thrills and visual imagery that deserves more attention than it gets. It suffers from poor writing and a thin plot, but I'll put these visual and audio effects up against any film that's out there. This director needs to direct more blockbuster films. Imagine his skills with a solid plot, or an MCU franchise. Don't watch this on your phone or laptop-it deserves the biggest screen possible. Enjoy!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
How did this happen?,"It's difficult to convey in words just how bad this movie is, but imagine if someone asked a bunch of random people who'd never acted before to make a movie based on a script that only contained the words ""Kong: Skull Island"" well that movie would be infinitely better than what we actually got.I refuse to believe that functioning adults wrote and allowed this movie to be made, I have to assume that movies are now being written and produced by a really crappy AI that someone found kicking around on an old floppy disk. Oh and for anyone wondering, Samuel L Jackson basically plays Samuel L Jackson, the same one dimensional character he's worn thin over the years, I suspect this wont come as a surprise to anyone though.I feel pretty confident in saying that unless I accidentally watch the new Transformers movie that this is the worst movie I'll watch all year.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I had a good surprise when I went to watch this!,"I only saw one trailer before going so I had no spoiled scenes and I hadn't read any reviews like the low-starred ones that are probably going to be below my post and I am SO thankful I didn't do those things. Why? Kong Skull Island was an AMAZING monster movie, if not the best monster movie I have ever seen. Awesome visuals and music, good cast and OK story but the monster action in this movie was the BEST! Unlike Godzilla which takes like 1hr to be shown in the 2014 film, we get a look at Kong early on but also throughout the entire movie. In short, I loved it, my friends did as well. It might lack a bit of logic but to be honest, look at ANY action/adventure movie from Hollywood and you won't see any logic in it. So the people saying that in reviews in here are total hypocrites. People who enjoy movies like Fast and Furious would most likely like the movie.

Clichés done well to create entertainment,"Kong: Skull Island is a 2017 film that takes place in the new ""monsterverse"" (which consists of Godzilla 2014, Kong: Skull Island, Godzilla: King of the Monsters, and Godzilla vs. Kong which will release later this year). I've only seen the 2014 Godzilla from this set of movies so I decided I better get caught up to watch Godzilla vs. Kong. I don't have too much to say here so I'll try and keep it brief. It takes place in 1973 as the Vietnam War has just ended. This film has a handful of cliches, with each character kind of having cliche aspects, but surprisingly enough the film actually takes these cliches and makes something neat out of it. It has some really interesting themes about war and commentates on the time period it's set in. The characters are mostly all interesting, although I did find some of the humor in here to be forced and not very funny. There is some really cool cinematography and lighting in here that makes the whole film visually interesting to watch. The CGI is surprisingly good and a lot of the special effects look nice. I did find the soundtrack to be stereotypical as it used a lot of songs from the time period instead of a big score. Overall, the film takes some cliche'd ideas, expands on the more interesting elements, and throws King Kong in to make an incredibly entertaining experience. Its themes aren't as well done as something like Godzilla (1954) but they are still there. Kong: Skull Island gets a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An average movie that didn't actually need Kong,"The film is a combination of good actors doing their best with what they are given, nice special effects and completely no story. Basically, it is about a bunch of people on an alien planet. It would have worked just as well. In fact, it would have worked better to explain an island that mysteriously has a completely different ecosystem than the rest of the world. And I have to say, a sequel to this would REALLY not need Kong at all, just a remake of Verne's The Lost World.There isn't much in the story that isn't spoiled by the trailer. And that's because that's the whole story. In it, Kong is just a big monkey. There are no subtle shots at Hollywood's system as in the original, nor much emotional charge. Half of the film is about the other animals on the island and a quarter about how crazy Sam Jackson's characters can get, so it's not even a movie in which Kong has a leading role. It would have been braver and more sincere to just kill the big ape in the first minutes and then get on with their alien explosions movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Yeah. That was an unconventional encounter.,"So here we have it, part two of the franchise reinvention of the beloved iconic creatures of cinema lore. After the 2014 redux of Godzilla was something of a tonal misstep, it's unsurprising to find this version of the King Kong legacy going all out blockbuster popcorner, and with that it succeeds - kinda.Plot is wafer thin, bunch of humans from various professions rock up at the uncharted Skull Island, each with differing levels of interest as to what might be there. Of which they quickly find out is a whole heap of trouble - big trouble!It's clear that the makers, fronted by director Jordan Vogt-Roberts, are trying to blend crowd pleasing mayhem with thoughtful observations of not only the period the pic is set (1973), but also of man's inherent propensity for stupidity. On the surface, the battles and creature feature carnage in general, are wholly entertaining, but it's sometimes just too ridiculous for its own good. Even worse is that it's shallow, with no real substance of note, particularly where the characters are concerned, rendering a very admirable cast as one note players in the gorilla maze.However, irritants aside, the pic is great fun, with enough excitement and quip based dialogue to make the time spent on Skull Island worthwhile. Be it man versus beasties and the alien terrain they traverse, a popcorn muncher it be. There's some sly humour within (Nixon going down), and the nods towards Coppola and Cameron et al are pleasing as punch. You may have to lower expectation levels to not let the problems it has drag you down, and for sure it's not hard to understand why a lot of folk hate it, but it's not a disaster, far from it.One does hope, though, that the next instalment in this series goes up another couple of notches, for Kong, Zilla and the other monster gods deserve it. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Special effects are dazzling- the scene where the mercenaries first encounter King Kong is mesmerizing, and the actors know what to expect from a film like this and go along, especially John Goodman. This is a brand-new reimagining of a story that everyone knows and yet Kong: Skull Island will leave you pleasantly surprised. All credit to the director Jordan Vogt- Roberts.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Nice remake...,"""Kong: Skull Island"" is an Action - Fantasy movie in which we watch a group of scientists going on a desert island in the Pacific.

It was nice, it contained plenty of action and suspense, something that made it even more interesting and it also had very good visual effects. The direction which was made by Jordan Vogt-Roberts was very good and he did an excellent job on the way he presented both his main characters and the plot. The interpretations of Tom Hiddleston who played as James Conrad, Brie Larson who played as Mason Weaver, John C. Reilly who played as Hank Marlow and Samuel L.

Fresh take on King Kong,"Kong: Skull Island was directed by Jordan Vogt Roberts, starring Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L. Jackson, Brie Larson, and John.c Reilly. The Vietnam war has just ended, John Goodman plays the head of monarch A government organization investigating the existence of monsters. They hire a military escort led by Colonel Packard(Samuel Jackson) and a tracker played by Tom Hiddleston to travel to an uncharted island where they meet Kong a giant ape who's bent on protecting the island and its inhabitants. This film takes a different approach than most King Kong films. It's set in the 70s as opposed to the 30s and offers a change in scenery. Paying tribute to other Vietnam classics like Apocalypse now and full metal jacket with a sense of humor. One of the strangest transitions you cut from a guy falling in Kong's mouth to a guy eating a sandwich that tells you the kind of humor you're getting in this. The human characters each have their perks some more than others and some questionable play off of those typical troops they are arrogant and full of themselves however they are soon out of their dad when they finally meet Kong. Tom Hiddleston plays a former British special air of service captain hired as a tracker to lead everyone to safety. While a decent performance, he doesn't do anything that gives you a reason to be fully invested in him dialogue-wise. He gets a decent amount of action scenes, Similar to Adrian Brody's character of Jack from the Peter Jackson film. More the guns and the actions as opposed to having more of a personality. Samuel Jackson's Colonel Packard is a war-crazed soldier who after losing the war. Find a new obsession with Kong and sees him as the enemy that's where the set of another film plays well to fit in either a certain character. Though predictable Samuel gives a good performance and it makes you hate this character throughout the film. Endangering his man in a battle he knows he can't win. The rest of the cast is pretty hit or miss the soldiers overall for the humans are the highlight Particularly the banter between mills and Cole Who is gonna be the most remembered out of the rest of the platoon. John C Reilly's Character has kind of a quirky awkwardness to Damn gives us the film over humorous tone to it and some more personality what I supposed to say Godzilla 2014 where it feels like all the humans for the most part bland and on interested I did all the humans the one main character that just doesn't seem like they belong there is Brie Lason's character yeah she has a connection to Tom's character but she has no reason to be here and some say she can document and photograph the events but you have John Goodman and his scientist there to document what's going on and outside of like one scene where she interacts with kong she doesn't have much of a reason to be in this movie. She doesn't serve the same purpose as Ann did in the original or the Jackson version. Kong doesn't fall in love with her or anything like that although she does show him that they are on his side she still comes office she just doesn't belong there. Lastly Kong himself of course he's more Scaled to Godzilla size but he comes off as benevolent. The movie gives more personality to him or you find out more about who he is through visuals and cave drawings it's also nice to see how he's rougher. Kong has cuts and scars all over his body shows that he's been fighting for a long time. And shows that he's not just dumb muscle like he knows how to use tools and weapons to his advantage. Kong Skull Island has a good film with interesting concepts and visuals do it or does it have the standard that the Peter Jackson version of the original and when they debuted it does offer enough to keep you invested wanting more.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I won't say the acting will be award winning but for this movie it doesn't matter. You know a movie like this one will never win any awards, that's not the point. The point is to be entertained and that is exactly what I was with Kong: Skull Island, entertained. The special effects and CGI's are clearly well done, way better than most of the movies in this same genre. The story isn't actually that bad, like some people wants to make us believe. It's easy to follow, nothing special, but I didn't expect anything else of a movie with this theme. My question is, why are people going to watch a movie like this if it's not their genre of movie?

OK monster flick,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Kong: Skull Island"" (2017) is a disappointing movie if you compare it to Peter Jackson's ""King Kong"" (2005) which was without a doubt - best Kong movie ever made. ""Kong: Skull Island"" on the other hand is just a monster flick with Kong in it. Kong doesn't have any personality here nor did i had any feeling towards him - i didn't care if he nor anyone else survived here - and this is the worst part of the movie - so many great actors but there isn't anyone who i would remember, except for John C. Reilly - he delivered and stole every scene he was into.I really liked first ~30 min of this movie when they were setting this story, which wasn't original nor great, but it was done very well and thought ""oh were are in for a ride!"". But when that ride has begun, it was done so unfocused, so kinda badly edited that i almost missed when Kong made his entrance - poor pacing and editing. And after that ""Kong: Skull Island"" become very simple, not original, not highly involving monster flick in which i didn't really care about the outcome.Overall, ""Kong: Skull Island"" is a big budget monster flick with very good special effects, some nice action scenes, setting but that is pretty much it. It is a disappointing movie considering it has one of the most iconic movie monster ever, and you don't give a damn about him watching it.

Problems And Prejudices,"Attending the premiere of Kong many of one's anticipated problems and prejudices come true. I will keep this short because it is not meant as a polemic against anything, but rather a warning bell against the cliché-ridden den that is Hollywood, soon to be Chollywood.Did you watch X-Men: Days Of Future Past? How about Independence Day Resurgence (which they did not want to call Resurrection because there were so many of those!)?The well-known Hollywood problem of greed and avarice reappears when they have, absolutely cliché-ridden have, to insert a token Chinese character... not because he or she is integral or needed, but because they want to sell the film to China and show it in China. Plain and simple. Said actors should be ashamed of themselves as being there for no good story, acting or plot reason and Hollywood should be ashamed of itself. But then again, they have never atoned for their sin of 'product placement' why stop now?Did you think the last King Kong was too stylish? Then brace for Kong! Forced plot meandering, token Chinese chick prancing there for no good reason while doing exactly nothing other than sell to China (like Chinese audiences are so desperate and needy) and to satisfy new Chinese owners and investors, etc. Again Skull Island is not Crouching Tiger or Hero that tells a story with Oriental characters (and I love those), but it is a forced injection of token East Asian as Legendary Pictures promises to do going forward in every Batman movie now that Chinese conglomerate has purchased that studio. So, what do we get a useless Chinese woman not knowing why she is there in yet another sequel/remake/reboot/whatever/who cares anymore? Which takes me to another problem. Hollywood, get an original idea once.in.a.while. What another reboot? Yes, Jurassic park made tons of dough so the fault is ours. But, what is the price of loss of dignity? Look at JJ Abrams. No credibility, no future. He made a ton of money with his unadulterated accountant-driven so-called Star Wars, but he is now washed up and over exposed as a no-talent. The same is happening with these Chinese investors taking over films and force feeding audiences something that is obviously, er, force fed. As for this film, well it is a stylized Kong battling not against humans at first, but against local predators. And there is a token Chinese who is a female scientist. Whoopedeeda! Can you say Rebooted Star Wars syndrome? One last thing, there is a Vietnam connection and so the marketing collateral oh so cleverly hints at Apocalypse Now.Price of admission? Free at local premiere Value of story? None Predictor of the future? Sadly, high. Hollywood has a rope and it will hang itself with it.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Just not good.,"This movie was not good. I had somewhat high hopes coming into this movie. It has Tom Hiddleston, John Goodman and Samuel l. Jackson, so a pretty good cast. Trailers looked pretty cool. But I was tricked. It was awful. The story and filming was full of inconsistency, it was confusing and overall terrible. The action sequences are hard to follow. You keep thinking people are dying and then they show up again just fine. The characters are flat and totally underdeveloped. The ones they focus on die in totally anti-climatic manners. They overused slow motion. They used every cliché in the book but not enough to make it a parody. So it had the stupid moments of a parody but clearly was meant to be something serious.

A Wasted Opportunity That Offers Nothing New In Its Retelling Of The Legend of Kong,"After bringing the ""King of Monsters"" back to cinematic life in 2014, Legendary Pictures turns its attention to another behemoth to further solidify its own cinematic universe of super-species but all of it doesn't amount to much in the end, for Kong: Skull Island offers nothing new in its retelling of the legend of the giant ape.Kong: Skull Island follows a team of scientists & soldiers who, just before the end of Vietnam War, secure the U.S. government funding for the expedition of an uncharted island in the South Pacific but when they reach there, they encounter a 100-foot tall bipedal ape who destroys their choppers and leaves them dispersed & stranded in the unmapped territory, thus turning the survey job into a survival race.Directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts, the first act of Kong: Skull Island is its strongest, for the premise is expertly set up and the efficient handling of its ominous vibe & sense of foreboding evokes keen interest. But once all our characters are on the island and the main plot is set into motion, it loses momentum as Vogt-Roberts fails to juggle multiple subplots properly and is unsure whether to go for a lighthearted, fun-filled extravaganza or a serious & dark monster flick.Production design team imbues a sense of mystery & danger to the exotic place with its set pieces. Cinematography attempts to duplicate the haunting aura of Apocalypse Now with its radiant colour palette, skillful use of lighting & shadows but succeeds only in bits n pieces. Slow-mo camera-work is finely utilised during the first encounter with Kong but is ultimately overdone in the end. Editing is a mixed bag, VFX has its share of strengths & flaws while Henry Jackman's score is serviceable.Coming to the performances, Kong: Skull Island features a talented ensemble in Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L. Jackson, Brie Larson, John Goodman & John C. Reilly, with Terry Notary providing the motion capture work for the eponymous ape. Hiddleston is alright as the mercenary, Larson does nothing but take photographs & act surprised, Goodman is completely wasted in his role, Jackson plays himself while Reilly is mostly annoying, plus the excessive focus on his character was totally unwarranted.On an overall scale, Kong: Skull Island is just as mediocre an entry in Legendary's MonsterVerse as Godzilla but it does feature more monster mayhem, even if those brief battles never manage to be engrossing or emotionally fulfilling. Characterisation takes a backseat, its lame attempts at humour fall flat, most creative choices don't work out in the film's favour and, in addition to all that, there is pretty much nothing in it that we haven't seen before. Falling short on all scales, Kong: Skull Island is a wasted opportunity that neither understood its true potential nor looked up to see what was up for grabs.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Average Movie With Little To Remember,"Quite honestly, the only thing I remember about the entire movie (and I just watched it) is Kong himself! Putrid performances from John Goodman and Samuel L.

Nice One!,"I was positively surprised by this movie. I got curious about it because of the pretty strong cast playing in it and I find myself enjoying this very refreshing and entertaining Monster/action movie with very nice visuals. And because this film is about a monster and action I'm quite surprised by reviewers complaining about that things aren't realistic enough. In these sort of movies one shouldn't look for too much realism, but rather enjoy all the fantasy elements and impossible, but pretty great action scenes.

Not quite as good as Peter Jackson's King Kong,"Not quite as good as Peter Jackson's King Kong in my opinion, but a very fun movie nevertheless. Kong: Skull Island does a fantastic job of showing us what King Kong is capable of and showed us more of his emotion. And a fantastic teaser at the end there.Kong: Skull Island was a very nice parallel to the 2 Godzilla movies and gave me the feeling that yes, we are definitely going to see a Kong vs Godzilla movie down the road (and in hindsight, looks like I was right).

This Movie Set the Tone for Many Afterwards,"A great adventure that set up a major ""monsters in a place that's out to kill everyone"" genre in many movies after its release, Kong: Skull Island is full of action. The scenes are breathtaking, and the cinematography is like no other. And the creatures included make for a beautiful view of Skull Island. The movie's motto could definitely be ""don't get too attached"", but I wouldn't say that's necessarily a negative concept for what it's going for, even though some characters got mistreated. Samuel L. Jackson gave a chilling Lieutenant Colonel, too caught up in his insane desire for war. Each actor embodies their character well, but his stands out. The soundtrack is outstanding, giving us a mix of classic rock from its Vietnam War era time setting. It's a nonstop action that can't be skipped in a movie watcher's collection.

Big monkey = Big fun.,"This is the first entry in Warner Brothers and Legendary's Monsterverse. Set in the 70's this follows an expedition to the mysterious and newly discovered Skull Island.Evoking the vibe of 70's and 80's Vietnam war movies was a smart move and gives this film a style distinct from other Kong movies. The cinematography is very good with many striking images throughout the movie. The visual effects are outstanding.This is a more stylish B movie, with some horror elements and light gore, but the undertone is funny and fun. There's a stellar cast who all put in good performances, Samuel L Jackson is the standout and seems to be relishing in his antagonistic role.A special mention too for John C Reilly who's character is part eccentric idiot and part knowing elder sage, but the balanced performance makes this work well somehow.Some of the other characters lack depth and are a little stereotypical, but face it we're mainly here for Kong, and he is a formidable force of nature with a great screen presence. Did I mention the visual effects are fantastic? Haha.This delivers on the big screen spectacle and monster mayhem you would hope for, but doesn't hold much depth beyound that which is absolutely fine. It delivered what i wanted from it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
slogs along through generically fine effects,"with no more place to discuss a film like this, I guess I'll just post a review with 1 star to let people know this film does almost nothing.

If I was 10, the cartoon (CGI) parts might impress me, but as an adult, I just didn't care about any of it, have no interest in ever wasting time watching it again, and CERTAINLY DON'T RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.

Completely useless remake - CGI fest for the brain-dead,"This movie is a completely useless remake of a King Kong movie - the monkey is uglier (but if you look at it close-up through a lens it looks scarier, right? - wrong!) They replaced the T-Rex-es with a different kind of creatures that perhaps look scarier if they throw them at you in 3D, or in 4DX, when they splash you with water at the same time... And, yes, for the 4DX viewing this is a good ""ride"" - when the monsters fight the chairs are moving intensely and you're splashed and sprayed and rained with water and air and scents... it's a good amusement park ride. But other than that, in the moments when the actors... ""act"" (do they?!)... this movie is pure boredom. A 5-year old would have written a better script. None of the actors matter, none stick with you (other than, maybe, the American chick in tank top who shows she's got some boobs and that's why they put her there) So, if you need a 4DX ride and you can do something else when there's no monsters fighting on the screen, see the movie. If you'll see it in plain 3D or IMAX... you'll be really sorry you wasted the money. Honestly. PS Who the f**k is paying a**holes to make the rating look so high for dumb movies like this? and write pompous reviews?... Are they smoking something?... A Dog's Purpose got a 3-4 in his opening week, although it was a fun, warmhearted movie, just because PETA got upset with some nonsense stuff (human actors are way more traumatized during filming than that dog who was just being put into the water) - and dumb movies like this one have 7-8 scores?!?!

Some decent monster madness in this one.,"Not really connected to other ""King Kong"" films in terms of story or characters, this is a reboot for the new century, telling the familiar apes' story for a new generation. A bunch of dreamers / monster chasers led by Bill Randa (John Goodman) are accompanied by a military escort as they set out to explore a newfound South Pacific island. They'll find that the main occupant is an ENORMOUS gorilla (this may be the hugest Kong on record) - but there is absolutely no shortage of formidable creatures on the island. Leading the military is an officer (Samuel L. Jackson) who is a bitter warrior in need of a new enemy. Hired to guide these unlucky chumps is a British tracker named Conrad (Tom Hiddleston).You do have to be undemanding to get into ""Kong: Skull Island"". Don't watch it for the silly script, with its silly characters and silly dialogue. Instead, watch it for the generous amount of grand-scale action. These filmmakers were clearly trying to make sure that their audience was never bored. To that end, there's quite a bit of good monster action, as Kong is joined by a spider with VERY tall legs, giant wildebeest type things, a giant fresh water squid, and a menagerie of reptilian animals dubbed ""skull crawlers"". The movie is never more entertaining than when it focuses on Kong and his battles with his fellow island dwellers.As for these people who are foolish enough to invade Kongs' domain, you can't be bothered to care a lot for them. Some of the actors - Hiddleston, Goodman, the gorgeous Brie Larson - manage to survive with some dignity intact. John C. Reilly adds a lot of the comedy relief with his role as a soldier who's been stuck on the island since the second World War. Jackson actually delivers a performance instead of just being a personality.This does benefit from some lovely Hawaiian scenery, effectively shot in widescreen. And the CGI is actually some of the best that this viewer has seen; it doesn't look overly cartoonish. Kong is performed capably through the motion capture technique by Terry Notary and Toby Kebbell (the latter also plays the soldier Jack Chapman).This viewer can understand why some people would be unimpressed, but was able to take the bad with the good, and have a reasonably fun time with this.The use of all the rock songs got to be annoying. I didn't need *that* many reminders that this story takes place in 1973.Seven out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Watch For The Special Effects,"I have a soft spot for Godzilla but I did not expect much of this movie when I started it. I expected bad writing, poor acting and over the top special effects. Well, I got all three of those things but the over the top special effects ended up being what made the movie watchable. The story didn't make much sense and the acting was laughable at times but the special effects were some of the best that I have ever seen. And the fact that they were so over the top made it possible for them to be the main focus of the film. Seriously, whenever I wasn't enjoying a particular scene of dialogue some completely preposterous action scene that was expertly crafted would steal my attention. The explosions, Kong, the MUTOS, everything looked amazing. Other than that the movie was pretty bad but the special effects were so good that it was positive viewing experience. I'm also a sucker for Vera Lynn.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Monkey See!,"Kong: Skull Island (2017) -I was actually very surprised to find that although Brie Larson is no Fay Wray (1933), she's named after a smelly cheese after all, this film is far more concise than Jack Black's (2005) attempt and far more exciting than Jeff Bridges (1976) version. Therefore I think that this is probably the best Kong film I've seen, excluding 'The Simpsons' parody of course.It does have a very 'Full Metal Jacket' (1987), Apocalypse Now (1979) and the Vietnam chapter of 'Forrest Gump' (1994) sense to it, as in this version there are a lot of soldiers, who are still riled up, as the war has only just finished. The great soundtrack also adds to that vibe. There are elements of 'Journey To The Centre Of The Earth' (1959) too.It's interesting to see Tom Hiddleston in a more action based role. I think I like it, but I'm not quite sure? As my mother said though, he's a nice shape. There are just a few times when he strikes an action man pose and it looks a bit unnatural. I suppose that with a face like that and eyes so beautiful, you can get away with anything.Does Samuel L. Jackson ever have a day off from being himself though? I am quite frankly getting tired of seeing him in everything. Either he has a huge gambling habit that he needs to work all the time to pay for or he's got some power over the producers to keep putting him in films. What's in those photos or on those files and who are they about?If I could see some diversity from him it wouldn't be so bad, but he's always just the same and it gets boring. I wonder if, like 'The Hulk', he's just always angry too?I'm not sure that the comic relief in the form of John C. Reilly was necessary either? I think that are hundreds of other actors that could have played both Sam and John's roles without them seeming so out of place or irritating.The special effects though are very well done and it's a good job that I know that these beasties are all created on a computer or I might not sleep at night.Although, on an island so far from what we could call ""The Norm"", who's to say that the creatures don't exist? The lizards are a bit too odd for me however and actually quite creepy.I really do like this one though. I think that the story is appropriate and it set up 'Godzilla Vs Kong' (2021) very well. It certainly delivers what you need from a film of this genre and keeps you interested. It's done at a sensible pace and the majority of the cast fit in without any issues.737.87/1000.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An entertaining adventure that gives Kong the opportunity to take-up a new role,"What I really appreciate most about Kong Skull Island is that the film is not another remake. For as great a character Kong is, most of his Hollywood films have been about telling the same story from 1933. This film gives the character the opportunity to escape that distinction and do something new.It also marks the beginning of the MonsterVerse series. Legendary makes a shift in tone when compared to the 2014 Godzilla film as Jordan Vogt-Roberts deliberately focuses on entertainment and spectacle. And it is really well done stylistic entertainment. While the human characters are decidedly utilitarian, Kong himself is given lots of personality. Much like the original Kong film, it values spectacle and by that metric it is quite successful.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Nice spectacle,"I really liked King Kong from 2005, so I tried Kong: Skull Island. That one wasn't as good in my opinion, but it was still good. I thought the story was worse, but the setting was great. It was a very nice show with good CGI. What might have been a problem for some people in 2005's King Kong was the pacing. It took quite a while before Kong the monkey himself showed up. For me, it was fitting and it got my attention and I was just waiting to see when he would show up. Here we see him just a few minutes into the film, which probably gets a lot of people's attention, but not so much for me because I had nothing to look forward to when the film introduced King Kong in the opening minutes. But the aforementioned CGI was awesome and the action scenes were also gorgeous. I enjoyed the eye candy in the form of action to the fullest and that is also in my opinion the biggest draw of this film. I would watch Kong: Skull Island not for the story but for the action and CGI. It's just a nice spectacle. That's all. For me, it's a good film that I can recommend.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"For action and excitement, KONG does not disappoint","Merian C. Cooper and company tapped into something special with the original KING KONG (1933), captivating audiences with a fairly simple adventure fantasy (humans explore an undocumented island full of giant prehistoric monsters, and then bring one of the creatures back to modern civilization) and state-of-the-art cinematic special effects. But the story continues to resonate with moviegoers, through updates and retellings, out of a sympathy for Kong, the wild animal who fights dinosaurs at home, but is out of his depths in man's world.The 1976 remake of KING KONG set the familiar events in the (then-)modern world, with shady oil corporations and environmentalists. In 2005, LORD OF THE RINGS helmer Peter Jackson retold Kong's story using the latest special effects technology, setting the three-hour epic during the original 1930s time period (and especially emphasizing Kong's emotional connection with Naomi Watts's would-be damsel in distress).Over a decade later, KONG: SKULL ISLAND (2017) brings the giant gorilla back to the screen for a new generation, and a new blockbuster franchise. As the title suggests, the film is all about Kong's homeland of Skull Island. The film doesn't follow in the footsteps of prior iterations, as it positions Kong as a character who can appear in future sequels and spin-offs (facing off against other giant movie monsters from the Godzilla family of films).Like the 1976 film, SKULL ISLAND updates the Kong story from the old-timey 1930s, placing the events in the retro 1970s. Specifically 1973, at the close of U.S. involvement in Vietnam. Exploring the unexplored island is John Goodman, a monster hunter supposedly (and secretly) working on behalf of the U.S. government's Cold War interests (find the monster before the Russians do!) and accompanied by Samuel L. Jackson's helicopter squadron, fresh off their tour in Vietnam and ready to head home. Also along for the ride are Tom Hiddleston, an expert tracker to get the team through the jungle; Brie Larson, an anti-war photojournalist; and assorted scientists and technicians.There's tension among the crew even before they encounter the skyscraper-sized gorilla. Military man Jackson and anti-war Larson don't see eye to eye, the scientists stick their noses up at the soldiers, and Goodman's urgency to find his monster puts him at odds with the better judgment of those who'd abort the expedition due to hellacious weather conditions. Once he witnesses Kong's destruction, Jackson, bitter about the outcome in Vietnam (a war that wasn't ""lost"", but ""abandoned""), focuses his entire being on destroying his hairy nemesis (an unpopular agenda among survivors keen on escaping the island with lives and limbs intact).Worries of the sympathetic creature in Peter Jackson's 2005 film having been truly recast as a hellish ""monster"", a terrible force of nature, may persist after the horror of Kong's first encounter with the helicopter squadron. But, new direction and all, SKULL ISLAND makes sure to hit upon the beats of the winning King Kong formula.As is tradition, a tribe of natives inhabits the island. But this time there are no ritualistic sacrifices at the altar of Kong. In this version, the natives worship Kong as their protector, for it is the great Kong who keeps the nasty ""skull-walker"" reptiles at bay and fights off the other Skull Island beasties. John C. Reilly plays a marooned WWII pilot who's been living among the Skull Islanders for twenty-eight years and can explain things to the wandering survivors.In this way, Kong is softened a little. He's merely protecting his territory from invaders. And in the grand scheme of things, Kong fights on the humans' side, or at least provides necessary opposition to the man-eating terrors that await in the jungles of Skull Island. Kong is no real threat unless provoked, and the humans need Kong on their side if they hope to survive.There's even a hint of Kong's famous weakness for pretty girls, in a scene where the savage Kong is tamed, if only for a second, by the beauty and kindness of Brie Larson. SKULL ISLAND eschews the damsel-in-distress story-line, but pays homage to the connection between ""beauty"" and ""the beast"".SKULL ISLAND is packed with action and terror. Besides Kong batting helicopters out of the air and stomping on fleeing personnel, there are the giant bone-chomping reptiles, vicious pterosaurs, towering spiders, and other unknown dangers threatening the scattered crew. Viewers never know what might happen. People die in a multitude of horrible ways. Survival until the final credits is certainly not assured, and the film builds on its tension with some clever match cuts.One particularly tense scene makes inventive use of a malfunctioning camera flash to track a creature through the fog, and another scene subverts an expected act of heroism. The action scenes throughout the film are exciting, and make for a fun trip to the movies.Samuel L. Jackson is scary as a slightly unhinged general hell-bent on avenging the deaths of his men. John C. Reilly steals the show as only he can, combining his signature brand of crazy with the film's moral center. Hiddleston and Larson are good, too, but despite little character moments, the main soldiers remain forgettable monster fodder.The quasi-modern update is welcome and refreshing dressing for the bones of the adventure plot, with the Vietnam conflict right in the rear-view mirror and the Cold War context. The technology is modern-ish, but pre-digital (to keep things interesting), and the period rock music played by the soldiers is still popular today.King Kong purists may miss the Empire State Building, but for the purposes of the new Kong-Godzilla shared movie franchise, SKULL ISLAND's narrower focus seems appropriate, and this latest version of Kong manages to take a new approach to the mythos while honoring its legacy. This new Kong is still Kong, and maybe audiences will soon get to see this protector of mankind step in against other famous larger-than-life creatures.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

Best monster movie I've seen in a long time,"Monster movies are a genre of their own, and common rules don't apply. Plots need to follow certain formulas and the drama is always somewhat predictable. I haven't always been a fan of the genre, not least because there are a lot of big-budget stinkers in the past. This is not one of them.First of all, breaking the standard plot for a King Kong-movie helps. Another straight remake like the one from Peter Jackson would have been unbearable. Adding a lot of well-known and well-performing actors also help. Of course the movie is packed with special effects, and yet I'm not really bothered by them the way that I often am. Not that they are very life-like or believable, but they are done with a certain flair. Also, the ape itself is just the right amount of human.When it comes to popcorn-movies, this is the real deal.

Never Thought I'd Miss Naomi Watts Ice-Skating...,"I was looking forward to this latest over-sized ape. Coming from the studio who brought us the 2014 Godzilla, starring a stacked cast, and boasting a stylishly fun trailer, I was all-in. Unfortunately, Kong is a special kinda bad, like a throwaway 90s adventure with as much brains as subtlety. It's corny but cynical; it's tongue-in-cheek but mean-spirited; it even made me miss Kong ice skating with Naomi Watts. It's an awful scattershot of varied tones & overwhelming styles. In a re-imagining of the discovery of Kong, a group of scientists, explorers and military-men in 1971 make a trek to the mysterious & monster-filled Skull Island. It's full of some of the biggest actors around, both up-and-coming & veterans. Sadly, it's one of the biggest wastes of a great cast in years, as they are given an unbearably clichéd and incomprehensible script. The soldiers (Jackson) are angry, the scientists (Goodman) are reckless, and the pretty white people (Hiddleston, Larson) are romantically shoved together. The character purposes are unclear, the dialogue is mind-numbing, and the message is essentially, ""Violence: bad. Empathy: good."" Even the basic choice of creating intrigue is pushed-aside, opting to obnoxiously shove us into the monsters' faces from the get-go. It's all as graceful as Kong himself. Not that it isn't stylish; just the opposite. Director Vogt-Roberts decided that if you CAN use a cinematic trick then you SHOULD. Random zoom-in / push-outs, incessant slo-mo, quick edits, old-style reel-to-reel effects, and laughable 3D-only shots; it's a boring theme-park ride, including narrative heft. There's lots of great stuff in theaters: Logan, Get Out, Split, Lego Batman (which has Kong in it!); don't waste your time on this loud-garbage.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Skull and Bones,"The rewatching of the Monster-verse, inspired by the ""Monarch"" show continues on to ""Kong: Skull Island"" - the one I was most concerned about watching with my pre-teen son, but actually it's less gory than Peter Jacksons' film.With the Vietnam War lost, America prepares to withdraw from the area. Bill Randa (John Goodman) seizes a small window of opportunity to engage a team, with military support, to recon a small uncharted island in the South Pacific. The team, including Randa, a troop of soldiers led by Colonel Packard (Samuel L Jackson), British tracker James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) and photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson) begins a tactic of dropping concussion bombs to map the land mass but are interrupted and quickly overwhelmed by a giant Gorilla.This is, perhaps, a better film than I gave it credit for. Above all else, visually it's really really well done. The landscapes of Vietnam and Hawaii are beautiful and evocative of a world undisturbed by human influence, until it very much is during the film. Kong himself looks great, as do the other creatures we see. The Skullcrawlers are impressive and nightmarish too, and a particularly epic looking scene, in the midst of giant gorilla bones and a screen full of bright yellow smoke shows them off to the full.Jackson's Packard is a good character, the real villain of the piece. He's already annoyed at his involvement in the futile efforts of the Vietnam war, but then takes the loss of his men as the excuse to go full Ahab, attempting to kill Kong despite being informed that his place in the ecosystem here may affect the whole world. To be critical, with the exception of John C Reilly's character - the majority of the rest of the cast don't leave much of an impression, with their characters left to either look in awe at things, or get killed.To keep things spoiler free as I can, there's a death in the film that was almost comedic the first time I saw it but has now been retrospectively made both sadder and more shocking by the ""Monarch"" series.Could it have been more fun and with better realised characters, sure. I enjoyed this rewatch though and will press on to ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"".",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

B) the movie is a scene stealing mash up from many movies that the 50+ remember from groundbreaking movies. Especially Apocalypse Now. I realize that the 40- generation may not remember such cinematic masterpieces but boy this movie is lazy, lazy, lazy. Oh well :(Let's aim it like this. This is a perfect movie to watch on TV during the holiday season at home. You can happily go off and have a manicure, whip up a soufflé or more excitingly, take a mini cruise without fear of missing anything. If there are more than two people watching this with you, you can do a little experiment. See how many people go to the loo or wander off for half an hour without saying ""can you pause it? I'll be back in a min"" Believe me you won't miss a thing that makes the story hard to dip back into and follow. I can't criticise the cast, we all need to pay the rent.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

If you love Kong and you love movies about monsters this a ticket you can't miss out on.The actors in this film were great especially John C.

The Great Ape!,"An iconic legend returns to the big screen in order to add on to a new cinematic universe as the 2nd installment. The classic storyline that you are use too is replaced when an organization seeks answers about the mysteries of monsters on a recently discovered island.

"Not bad, What Were You Expecting?","Everyone always starts, I have seen a lot of bad reviews.......and so with Kong some song, but wait.....What Were You Expecting? I liked all the giant creatures, at a moments notice you could be eaten alive or squashed like a grape, man is no longer the top of the food chain and that is scary to me. This movie would have scared me as a child, you may say a child should not see this until a certain age but my mother took me to see Jaws when I was only 4 and we live very close to the Gulf of Mexico and warm shark water and I still do not go in water I can not see the bottom. OK, back to Kong, really not that bad, some parts were just as good as any Jurassic Park movie, if you like those movies with huge CGI monsters than this will be your cup of tea. I like the fact that they still stuck with the idea that Kong is a good guy and only bad men want to kill me. If you are still a child at heart, not a bad rent at all. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Appalling, offensive, American-centric trash","Just trash. Two words that describe this absolutely awful movie. I concur with all the other reviewers who gave this movie a score of 1. I didn't read the reviews before I went to see this movie (my mistake) and I endured it for the sake of the other people with me who also hated it, otherwise I would have left after 30 minutes.

"Kong Rocks - practically all of this does too; a sharp, smart, exciting blockbuster","Though not without a few WTF moments - and not in the way that is fun but more head-scratching, like a couple of characters dying out of nowhere - this is the most entertaining monster movie since The Host and possibly from Hollywood since... well, the Jackson King Kong (though it also has some debt to Jurassic Park and, to a degree a friend reminded me after seeing the film, Aliens). Aside from what is in the movie in and of itself, which is plenty as an ironic and satirical blockbuster (at least up to a point, in small but enough doses), as a world-building enterprise it's spectacular, and is a step up from the previous entry in this new WB/Legendary ""Moster-Kaiiju-Verse"", Godzilla.I think the difference between the two is simple but profound: Edwards was fascinated more with spectacle and the presence of Godzilla, but he wasn't so set on building human characters to connect with (except for Bryan Cranston, who was shamefully wasted after a promising start). Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts is all about characters, and even gives some time to people who should be nothing secondary ones (I know the complaints already coming, that there are too many, and that may be true - on a first viewing I was fine with it for the simple fact that the dialog given to these military runts and other scientist-types were either funny or clever enough. Everyone has charisma and characters who need to have chemistry (Hiddleston-Larson, or Larson and Kong) give it enough juice in that area.But more than that is that Kong himself is done right by the writers and filmmakers. Unlike in Godzilla as well, here we have a character who actually IS a character, someone who functions in the story, shows deeper wells of emotion (yes, a carry-over from the best of the 1933 and 2005 Kong movies is that Kong is vulnerable), and finds through non-verbal communication how to connect - or decidedly not, quite the opposite - with these Vietnam war hosts. He has goals and real motivations; while they are steeped in monster movie lore, it's sharp and exciting monster movie lore, and things are explained by John C. Reilly here and there (he's the 28-years-gone survivor of being left during WW2, a more innocent-yet-still-bloody time in US history, also with us vs some Asian menace), yet a lot is left to the imagination.How do these prehistoric-ish ""Skull Crawlers"" come out from these blasts put out by these helicopters? Who knows? Who cares? The point is these giant lizard things are genuinely terrifying; there's some limited creativity in their designs, but what's exciting is that the direction is all about drawing out suspense. And the island itself has many surprises (there's one point where a creature is revealed as something you would thing you could sit on!) and also with the natives who are... just scenery, mostly, but at least the movie doesn't try to go too far into cultural insensitivity or anything. They're simply there and do what they can for the Reilly character over these many years; Reilly, by the way, scruffy and laughing often and happy even as he is totally terrified (""I've only been here 28 years,"" he says at one point up against military/US egotism personified by Samuel L Jackson) is what Bryan Cranston was to Godzilla, only here there is much more and he's possibly the best human presence in the movie.How about the satire, if it is there? I think there's more that could be dissected with it being Vietnam, or more specifically in 1973 as Nixon is preparing for pulling out troops (of course that wouldn't be for a full two years later, but you get the idea). Jackson's Col Packard is trying to hide his anguish at having to ""abandon"" this war (he can't bare to say defeat) so this other South-East conflict will do; it's Us vs Them and Us as usual not recognizing all of our might is insignificant when on their turf. It's not the sharpest commentary ever, but it's not without accident it's there either. The iconography is compelling as well: all of those helicopters, blasting away Black Sabbath's ""Paranoid"" as these charges drop on the island - asking for it, in monster movie fashion (messing with nature, you fools!), but this time there's the added element of how soldiers and civilians act, and recognizing who is ""King"" in the end.This is a spectacular good time at the movies, in case I didn't make that clear. All of the actors are doing excellent work, the kind that you would never get to see back when monster movies were in the realm of square B-movie territory. If anything this would be a splendid double feature with Jurassic Park (aside from the eye-roll at Jackson repeating a ""butts"" line straight-faced, as if the movie would be in trouble unless he did it), as both involve charismatic, memorable actors and relatively decent supporting characters facing off against monsters that are from another time and place, with snappy dialog, and visual effects that are out of this world. And the climax - my Kong! Spinkle some 70's Vietnam-Rock icing and you got yourself a blockbuster cake of exceptional proportions.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fun dumb action movie,"It's a big dumb action movie that knows what it is and sticks to it. It noticed that the 2003 King Kong was too slow so it doesn't stop for a second. With great special effects and a good sense of humour, it works. Even though the characters are a bit shallow and are just there to become bodies Samuel l Jackson still gives it his all and John c.

"""Skull Island"" claims Kong for blockbuster, chaos-seeking moviegoers","King Kong holds the honor of being among Hollywood's first movie monsters, but ""monster"" has never been as relevant a label for the colossal ape as it is for his latest incarnation in ""Kong: Skull Island."" Whereas most people think of Kong as a misunderstood beast who falls for the beautiful Anne Darrow, in this film he possesses those instincts, but he's also an easy-to-anger killing machine.Despite the character's history in films with action elements but more poetic flourishes, ""Skull Island"" works to build Kong into an action hero capable of raking in blockbuster-level cash. The story and screenplay, which represents the combined work of John Gatins and Dan Giloy (""Real Steel""), Derek Connolly (""Jurassic World"") and Max Borenstein (whose ""Godzilla"" launched this monster universe for Warner Bros) does not completely strip Kong of his humanity, but he's a relentless force of nature in a film that pushes the boundaries of PG-13 violence.These writers have structured the story as a '90s monster movie: an expedition team including a researcher (John Goodman), geologist (Corey Hawkins), wilderness guide (Tom Hiddleston), photographer (Brie Larson) and a platoon of disappointed Vietnam vets (led by Samuel L. Jackson) fly through a storm to the mysterious Skull Island, where they're greeted by angry ape and encounter countless other larger-than-life creatures bent on killing/eating them.Though he be new to the big-budget filmmaking game, director Jordan Vogt-Roberts (""The Kings of Summer"") takes this solidly written albeit predictable story and does just enough stylistically to keep us on our toes the entire time. Once it becomes clear that characters' lives are not sacred in this movie, the thrill becomes waiting to see what unexpected and frankly shocking ways the story (and Vogt-Roberts) will remove them. Vogt-Roberts seems particularly adept at finding a balance between brutal/visceral violence and leaving some of that up to the imagination for full effect. He applies non-traditional angles and refreshing perspectives that ""Skull Island' gravitates between B- movie thrills and creative action filmmaking.The story leans on some classic archetypes that do enough to fuel the story in thoughtful ways. The characters get more interesting when John C. Reilly's Hank Marlow enters. Marlow is a World War II pilot who has been trapped on the island for 30 years and helps explain to the other characters that Kong is the good guy and a key cog in the island's ecosystem; he's the only one who can kill the island's giant man- eating lizards. This information leads to a schism: half the group wants to kill Kong and the others want to save him – familiar but effective.Goodman, Hiddleston and Larson are obviously all too good for this movie, but ""Skull Island"" is better for them. And absolutely nothing is surprising about Jackon's involvement or role, and that's its own kind of legitimacy. His Preston Packard character actually has the most complexity, whereas Hiddleston and Larson serve to make their two-dimensional characters appear to be deep and interesting, which they do well enough.Ultimately, the characters provide an assortment of victims and heroes for a ruthless jungle-set monster movie. Those with a thirst for that kind of mayhem will find ""Skull Island"" a gleeful adventure, but those looking to be moved -- or heaven forbid show it to their kids in hopes of a family-friendly outing – are bound to encounter disappointment if not outrage.""Skull Island"" reclaims King Kong's fearsome, creature-crushing side in glorious fashion, though it pretty exclusively plays to those tastes.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Entertaining Enough for Multiple Viewings.,"Review:
'Kong: Skull Island' is an American monster film directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts. The film is a reboot of the King Kong franchise, and serves as the second film in Legendary's MonsterVerse. Some people go to the movies to be wowed by the superb acting, heart wrenching and well written story, and overall solid production. This has a good story and good effects. The acting isn't bad, but it isn't award winning.
The story has characters Bill Randa and Houston Brooks (John Goodman and Corey Hawkins) piggybacking on an expedition to an uncharted island to test a theory they've been working on. The first hirer a tracker names James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) and assemble a team of highly trained Military professionals lead by Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson). As they enter the island, they start dropping seismic explosives, which create mini earthquakes for them to be able to map out the island. Suddenly, the air unit is attacked by the giant ape, scattering the survivors across the island. Two groups form between the survivors: Conrad, Mason Weaver (Brie Larson) and one of the soldiers gather quickly, while Randa and the rest of the soldiers land a few miles away. Packard goes in search of the transport helicopter piloted by his right-hand man Major Jack Chapman, (Toby Kebbell) intending to use the weapons on board to kill the ape that killed most of his men.
This movie much like Godzilla has some great talent, but it ruined with boring characters. Brie Larson plays a photographer and I have no idea what she is doing there. Anyone of these trained for combat officers could use a camera to document what is happening instead of endangering the life of a civilian. Her character didn't need to be in it and seemed to just be added to have the female character that Kong needs. John C. Reilly plays a surprisingly funny WW2 vet marooned on the island. Other then the actors playing the roles they were given; they are not fleshed out at all. We learn nothing about where they were before we see them in the film or why some of them have the talents they have.
I enjoyed the action in this movie, and Kong looked good, almost all the creatures looked realistic and all the fights between them looked good. Some of the green screen effects, like backgrounds behind characters, were distractingly bad. Ultimately, you get some great stuff out of all the effects if you're not looking too closely.
Overall, this movie is an entertaining story with lots of destruction. It's enjoyable for what it is, a monster movie with lots of action. The characters are lackluster and not all the likeable. You will be going into this for the entertainment factor and not so much the character development.

It's summer Schlock,"There are a lot of positive things about this movie. The CGI is good, the sets look great, the cast is adequate, and the story is fun. The film has a lot of beautiful shots and the colors are vibrant. I especially liked the northern lights. The costumes were decent and I enjoyed watching a big ape smash things. The fight scenes for Kong were great. They didn't get boring. He's dangerous to our characters and the story shows how he's needed to protect the island. The things that got in the way were continuity issues of time frame and the paper thin characters. The worst are played by Brie Larson, Tian Jing, and Tobby Kebbel. It's not the actors fault. They were given three characters we're supposed to care about but offer nothing to the story. While Jing and Kebbel's characters are not foremost in the story, Larson's character really wastes a lot of time to be the cute chick who's in the action. She's supposed to be the strong woman version of past damsels in the Kong Series. Problem is, those women were much stronger and more interesting than she ever was. First, they don't start off as the ""bad ass"" anti-war photographer. They start off as normal women in an dangerous situation. These women learn to survive with a massive animal who's probably going to eat them. They earn the animal's trust and establish boundaries (not well maintained mind you) which keeps the animal protecting them while they find a way to get out of their situation. Brie Larson's version is just a lame chick who cannot fight, looks pretty, and has little to no real reason to be Kong's interest (the other women were offered up to Kong which is why he's interested). It would have been better had Larson's and Jing's Character been combined. Jing's character was overshadowed and turned into another useless chick. That sucks because the two characters put into one would have been better than having two sub-par characters with little to no purpose. Honestly, why does anyone need a photographer on this adventure? Especially when you have characters like Randa and Brooks who already have cameras and a history of documenting research? At least Jing's Character could have had more screen time to explain her expertise and drive the story. But that doesn't matter. The film was still very entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Cracking Watch - Only Let Down By A Poor Script,"There's so much that's good here. The end of Vietnam War setting is a masterstroke, and transforms a familiar story into one with rather a different feel as a war movie. It looks stunning - there is so much brilliant cinematography, some really good directorial flourishes and the potential to deal with some interesting big ideas. The creature design is at times astonishing, all of which means when the action sequences happen they're brilliant. This makes the let-down of the script all the bigger - it's so exposition-heavy as to be unintentionally funny at times, and a good cast is ill-served by it. It's a cracking film, with lots going for it - but it could have been even better.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The Filmmakers Brain Must Be Thick As A Quiche,"What else can I write? Other review said it well and there should be nothing else to add. This film was a major letdown as an entity and for anyone out there who likes King Kong. I am disappointed that I spent my man's money just to be disappointed. The story was unbelievable (Japanese back story, Vietnam war in which we attacked the poor Vietnamese, a Chinese chick to sell tickets in China and then gigantic creatures at war) with little to no thought devoted to making it believable. The whole film seemed to be rushed to the big screen for the sole purpose of making money after a script was written analysed to include everything needed to make cash (again the aforementioned elements, a reboot, a couple of chicks, different men from different races, using a famous character's story and name...) . I am so sorry, but King Kong had a story and motivations, it deserves to be one of the best story lines brought to the big screen full of emotional backstory and humanizing feeling. I feel Hollywood has overdone the whole reboot thing.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fun no brained watch,"This is the best monster verse movie so far. It's truly ridiculous but great fun. Kong is awesome and I quite liked his back story. The saviour of the island rather than mad big ape. The acting is awful and all the characters are so stereotyped from similar movies. Gung ho army guys, mad general, Random hot female photographer and dishy British army officer who does not break sweat ever. The script is proper cheesy. You can't help but kind of like it. It's also a bit of a metaphor for the Vietnam War. Americans going to an Island they are not welcome and starting a war with they shouldn't get involved in. Finally Kong v Godzilla, am defo routing for the ape. Godzilla does not actually give a stuff about humans. He just wades into cities to fight monsters and does not care how much he destroys or how many innocents he kills in the process. He simply does not like anyone challenging his god like status. Kong meanwhile always shows genuine empathy to fellow creatures and tries to defend them. Kong truly is King",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Kong's entrance to monsters universe,"Kong: Skull Island is a new narration for the old story of King Kong, in other words, it's kind of an introduction of kong to the monsters' universe. The story begins with two scientists who gather a military crew, a photographer, and a tracker to set foot on an uncharted island which they discovered its existence by satellite photos. The plot has nothing special, no twists, and is predictable. As for the cast, I believe gathering a team of the expensive cast like Samuel L. Jackson, Tom Hiddleston, and Brie Larson paid off. Music and soundtracks were nothing worth mentioning but the sound effects were perfect. A lot of scenes were built by CG which are good and sometimes more than good.Overall, this is a high-budget sci-fi movie with a lot of CG that is worth your while if you are into this fictional genre. Other than that if you look for more drama like in Jackson's king kong movie or a movie with high standards in case of artistic values, you're totally in the wrong place.🎥⭐ 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Good CGI, but doesn't look ""legendary""","Honestly I hate King Kong. I can't stand seeing an ugly gorilla killing cool dinosaurs. Initially I had skipped this movie and directly watched Godzilla: King of the Monsters, but seeing how many references of this movie that movie had in the post credits and the fact that I needed to watch this to understand Godzilla vs Kong is why I watched this movie in the first place (I still haven't watched Godzilla vs Kong though lmao). This movie, however, wasn't that bad. In fact the CGI is pretty good.But that doesn't change the fact that an ugly gorilla is killing cool looking Skullcrawlers here, although I was satisfied that he could win only with the human help. Samuel Jackson plays the role of an annoying general who gets his comeuppance (which is the reason why I have given it such a good rating). He was so irritating. When he said he will kill all the Skullcrawlers after he kills Kong I felt like going in the screen and slapping him. Like, just one scene ago your entire squad got thrashed by only one Skullcrawler child and here you're dreaming of taking down every single one of them you zoophobe!?The movie takes place on an island in the 70's. Although Kong gets very less screen time and there is too much talking and exposition, it wasn't as bad as the Godzilla movies. The human characters were actually interesting. I liked the part where one of them dies when a giant spider steps on him and everyone thinks it's a tree. The professor who explains the entire context of the tribes worshipping Kong was also an interesting story. In the end they all manage to get away from the island and tell the world about what they saw. It was a good ending. If they had done something like saying why they were going to keep it a secret I'd have legit given it a 1 star rating.The CGI has been done very well. Although it features a number of cool creatures (the Skullcrawlers especially), it does not induce the same frantasy feeling that Godzilla movies do. It only makes it feel like giant creatures fighting in an island. It doesn't feel ""legendary"", like what you feel when you watch King of the Monsters' trailer. It just looks... Meh.Kong: Skull Island may not be some very extraordinary movie, but you do have to watch it if you want to watch Godzilla vs Kong. It's a bit annoying but makes it up with the colour palette. I really hope this is the last time I'm seeing the ugly gorilla. Because I am never going to re-watch this.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A good fun movie.,"Some of the reviews on here are a bit harsh. If you want academy award winning acting, great script writing and a deep plot. You don't go see a movie about a giant gorilla that's known for smashing stuff.Normally I avoid such titles as they are all so formulated. Which this was to some extent, but they did break away from the mold a noticeable amount. Which is a big part of what made it tolerable where others are not I had fun watching this movie. I thought it was pretty well done. By far the best King Kong since the old B&W version from 1933. The CGI was mostly plausible. Only a couple of moments of broken physics. The characters where about as well developed as they needed to be. Plot was pretty hole free.Its not 10/10 stuff, but its not trying to be either. They got this one just right.Normally I couldn't watch something in this genre all the way to the end. Or if I did I would be heckling it from about 10 min in as that would be more entertaining than the movie. Kong was different. I actually enjoyed it.

Truly disappointed,"I have seen movie campaigns going on and on in my country, flattering how the movie successes in bringing Vietnam's Halong Bay and all other spectacular scenes in Vietnamese countryside to life. Well I am really disappointed.First of all, boring plot, couldn't hold myself to yawn within only 15min beginning. The opening scene in certain sandscape looked quite fake, thought I could recognise my country from the view behind.Second of all, I made comment base on a view of an Asian. The Chinese actress Tian Jing totally plays a role of poster girl, no quality lines for her whatsoever. Please next time if you feel the need to have an Asian-looking actress/actor better to recruit someone else with acting know-how. The fact to put a random-but-with-strong-network Asian actress on show is really an insult for me personally. These continuous actions to build such characters only create more perceptions about uninteresting, unimpressive rather stupid & boring Asians. Asian actresses/actors could do ways better than that & they deserve more space to act.The truth is I walked out after 25min so just those two for now. I have read one comment saying that real excitements only begins after first 20min (and really, for such a blockbuster you are ready to spare up to 20min of first impression that lame ?)

A new dawn. The King has arrived.,"Seems I'm the only one who did not know it was not a sequel to the 2005 film. The Kong was over a 100 feet tall in this, compared to 25 feet from a decade ago. Being a big fan of that film and Peter Jackson, I hated this idea, especially for totally a fresh cast and crew. So I was not expecting it. Only while watching it, I came to know it was a new version. With a new cinematic, a new set of actors, timeline, completely a different kind of tone for a King Kong film that I have ever seen.They wanted it to be a badass action film than a value added storyline. That does not mean I loved it. It was average. I only enjoyed the nice action-adventures. But the visuals were a more commercialised. I even confused whether did I watched a Hollywood film or an Rajamouli film. You know those terrible methods used for stunt sequences.The most boring part of this film was the same old formula, which is a set of people enter in a dangerous enclosure and only a few come back alive. A couple of scientist escorted by a military to a mystery island hidden in the mists of the South Pacific to do some scientific research. Soon they come to realise they are in a dangerous place where giant monsters live. After losing some of the soldiers, now it becomes a survival game. But the general is obsessed with a revenge. How the rest of the story folds were told with a battle of the film.Basically, this film was created to merge two franchises, the rebooted 'Godzilla' with this one. The post end-credit scene gave some important hint about the future of the franchise. But I thought it was too similar to the comedy flick, 'Journey 2: The Mysterious Island'. Usually spoof films were made out of greatest hit films. But it looks like here a reverse case. Though all the actors were good. Nice direction, visuals, music, particularly the sound effects. This film is simply enjoyable and forgettable.There are many things I did not like. The Peter Jackson film was so artistic. Every frame was like a classic painting. In this, the Kong standing on his two feet, walking around like a man, totally turned me off. The giant ape did not behave like a real ape. Many sequences were also borrowed from many other films, only replaced with different creatures and recreated with a fresh setting. This is a perfect time pass film to have on a weekend. Particularly, if you are a graphile (graphic+phile), you would have a nice time.5.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Surprisingly Good Film!!!,"So I watched Kong Skull Island strictly because I like Tom Hiddleston (I'll be honest) and I was shockingly impressed by this movie.The writing and directions is surprisingly good, especially in the action scenes. The fights are really tangible and surprising.They some how manage hit the big cliches and also subvert them.Tere are some big name actors and they all do a good job. Nothing earth shattering, but they do their jobs. The characters aren't that interesting and would have probably fallen flat without the actors doing all the work to carry them. But they aren't bad or anything.The special effects look phenomenal. And the soundtrack works really well to make it feel like a war time movie. Like it has this weirdly nostalgic feel to it. Like if it wasn't for the modern special effects, I would have this weird sense memory of having watched this movie as a kid (and not just cause its a reboot).If I had to describe it, it is like Jurassic Park meets Saving Private Ryan. Anyway, I recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of 2017 most entertaining movies!,"I had no interest in another King Kong movie. Peter Jackson's 2005 remake was a boring rehash. When I first heard there was coming another I was like well they have to drag the franchise out for another try. Several big actors were to be in it but I had never heard of the director. But then the trailer and marketing for it started coming and it looked quite interesting and also and maybe especially it looked different. So eventually I actually went to the cinema to see Kong: Skull Island. Luckily that I did because this is really a movie which should be seen in the cinema.Kong: Skull Island is the definition of a popcorn movie. Where the 2005 movie was drawn out and almost pretentious this movie wastes no time to get to the action and adventure. The action is outstanding in entertainment. Obviously there is a lot of cgi. However I'm not against computer made effects just for no reason. Some things are hard to do in other ways and as long as it doesn't feel like it's used for laziness sake it's fine. And in this movie it works fine. The action in this movie was among the most exciting I saw last year. Some complained about the characters being thin and while that criticism does have a point I don't think it matters much here. This is a fun action adventure that doesn't need deeply developed characters. They are not what's important. They are just enough for this type of movie. And the performances are good. Samuel L Jackson is the bad*** that he always is and does so well, Tom Hiddleston gives us a glimpse that he could definitely play James Bond, Brie Larson works well with what she's got even if it's not a lot. The best is John C. Reilly, his character is the most interesting and performance the most entertaining. Simple they may be but they do all have some distinct personality. Minor complaints are that many of the quotes that are meant as jokes don't land but for me it wasn't a big issue, the movie is funnier in other ways. Like previously stated I knew nothing about the director who it turns out had only directed one other movie but he totally nailed this one. He gets great performances even if the script probably didn't give much to work with. I love the look of the movie, the style it's done in. The shots of helicopters flying over the island and Kong silhouette against the sun. It could have taken this grim and gloomy look which I'm so glad it didn't. Another thing is the music, while there is tunes that are written for it the movie uses a lot of songs from the era when it is set which works perfectly. Having a lot of well known songs can work greatly in the right kind of movie but not all.Kong: Skull Island was one of the most surprisingly good movies in 2017. A movie that knows what it is and embraces it. It's campy and over the top and I like it. No one would claim it to be any amazing piece of work but I believe the filmmakers totally know it and all for the better. I have seen a lot of 2017 movies and Kong: Skull Island was while definitely not the best but one of the most thoroughly entertaining. See Kong: Skull Island if you haven't already. I have several times.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not as clever as a signing gorilla but very entertaining,"This starts off with opposing World War 2 airmen having a fight on a deserted Pacific island.
What leaps out straight away is that apparently our Japanese pilot was flying around in his single seat fighter with a goddamn samurai sword strapped to his belt.This is a blatant telegraph from the director to say ""this film is dumb. If you want clever this isn't it! Go away!""Once you are on board the train of stupidity you can sit back and relax.Flash forward to the early 1970's
For some dumb reason a bunch of dumb arse U.S soldiers are diverted from the Vietnam evacuation to take some equally dumb scientists and boffins to what is clearly Death-Trap island.Once on Murder-Island we are treated to monsters and helicopter fights and giant insects and raging storms and of course a very big monkey.The scenes and characters are big and brash and dumb and so very enjoyable.The story is too moronic for me to repeat - but in a good way.This is quite graphic in places and squeamish children may get nightmares.
Apart from that just lock and load and watch a bunch of dumb-dumbs get their arses handed to them.Stick around for the obligatory after credits scene.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Worth seeing at the theater!!!,"I had a lot of reservations going to see this. I assumed it was riding on the tail of other Kong movies and was going to be a waste of time. I was dead wrong. Kong: Skull Island is what a Kong movie should be. It was entertaining in many different ways but the best part about this movie is the non-stop creative use of death and violence. I know that seems strange to hear but go see it and you'll see. You'll love how creative some of the scenes are!!!! Thank you KONG!!!10/10 stars, easy decision!!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Another missed remake,"Kong: Skull Island - Repackaged for 2017, this attempt doesn't take a whole lot of risks. The production design, sound, and sense of scale were really the only positives I could find. The soundtrack was enjoyable, but came off a bit cliché. The exact songs you'd expect to be in a Vietnam war film are front and center.The movie is all but devoid of humor. And I don't mean it takes itself too seriously or doesn't make time for jokes, I mean that the jokes are just hopelessly off the mark. Lines are delivered and it's almost like the editor left in a beat or two after each one to allow the crowd time to laugh without missing anything. This only made them more cringe-worthy because the movie was shamelessly telling you ""this is a funny part!"" while all we heard were crickets. For the first couple of them I found myself thinking ""there has to be more to the joke, I'll just wait for -- oh OK that was it."" There were a few sections of dialogue that were clearly rerecorded after filming. A person would be delivering a line and then, when the camera was at their back, or on someone else in the scene, the tone and cadence would be noticeably different than their lines before and after. And sometimes they didn't even bother to cover it up. There were two distinct moments where what the actor was mouthing wasn't remotely close to what you were hearing.Lastly, even with this star studded cast (Samuel L. Jackson, Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larsen, John Goodman, and John C. Reilly) the writers still couldn't provide memorable characters. The development was so poor that out of all them I actually could only remember the name of Samuel L. Jackson's character by the end of the movie. But does that even count? I was only able to do so because you could see it prominently on his jacket throughout the film.I went in with high hopes, and while I did enjoy it more than the 3 hour offering from Peter Jackson in 2005, I'm still just not a fan. It would seem this story in general is not for me. Having said all this I'm still hopeful for Kong's planned crossover movie with another certain monster in a few years. It should afford the opportunity to break away from the familiar. For now, however, I'm stuck with another safe remake. 4/10.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Flashy Reimagined Kong With Flaw,"21 March 2017. With shades of the classic war movies Good Morning Vietnam (1987) and Apocalypse Now (1979) and perhaps even the monster epic Journey to the Center of the Earth (1959) and perhaps Jurassic Park 1993), this reimagined Kong movie begins with both a measured surprise and a quite different Kong movie that shows a lot of promise. Nevertheless, the script eventually falls flat in places as the plot points become more important than the realistic strategic or authentic flow from scene to scene. A huge example of the manipulation of a screen stretched to the breaking point in order to maintain the director's or producer's intended rational for a scene later in the movie is the first gigantic encounter between man and beast and it's pretty much an overkill and unbelievable disaster for man. And at almost regular intervals thereafter there are humans that seem to fall prey in order to show off some special effect cuteness that really doesn't do much for the movie and with little rationale except attempt to justify the cost of the movie. This sort of demise is repeated over and over again just in order to perhaps reduce the number of characters to manageable proportions and extend the time of the movie. A lot of editing and cutting would probably have made the pacing of this adventure action movie much more palpable. Nevertheless, the plot outline of this Kong version is very distinctive and admirable in concept and there are some great individual scenes and photographic images that boggle the mind. The ending credits film images also is a plus along with the outstanding presence of John C. Reilly almost carries the show.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fast-Food from the Clone Factory,"I will make it short - this movie is imo no total fail but no cinematic triumph either and also not a good one. But if you enjoy the movies of Mr. Emmerich you will like this one also - lots of explosions, here and there some humorous scenes, some (cgi-)monsters and ofc King Kong and last but not least, tons of inconsistencies and forgettable 2-dimensional characters.So if you like Independence Day, The Day After Tomorrow, 2012 etc. watch this version of King Kong, if you don't like such movies, skip this one. Summa summarum: another waste of a fantastic character like the last Tarzan endeavor.p.s. sometimes I suspect Hollywood got some script-generating- algorithm developed and saves the money for writers, of such generic ""quality"" are many of the Hollywood products of past years, Skull Island is another proof of this theory ;)",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Unabashed popcorn film is enjoyably unpretentious entertainment (Kong smashed real good),"And unabashed popcorn film, with no deeper meaning or subtext, is delightfully endearing in it's simple (although big budget) adventure story. Set during the waining day of the Vietnam War, John Goodman plays a government agent specializing in the strange and mysterious has discovered an uncharted island and convinces his superiors to give him a detail of soldiers from Vietnam to help him explore the titular island. That island is full to giants monster, mysterious natives, and also a WWII pilot who was shot down 25 years ago and doesn't know the war is over. John C. Reilly really steals the movie as the WWII solider marooned on Skull Island, but he does have competition from Samuel L. Jackson as the commanding officer leading the US soldiers helping Goodman, British airman Tom Hiddleston, and photojournalist Brie Larson. The action is fun, the characters are likable, and Kong smashes things real good. Beside John C. Reilly being awesome, the next most interesting element to the film is that it was set during the Vietnam War and treats the era with a rather light touch and not the usual downbeat tone that typically surrounds Vietnam set war films, which is something I cannot recall seeing in any other major film before (unless you want to count John Wayne's ""The Green Berets""). Throughout the 70s and 80s, most every Vietnam war film was pretty heavy, and even the ones with a lighter touch, like ""The Boys in Company C"" or ""Good Morning, Vietnam,"" still made sure the audience was aware that this was a terrible and horrific war. The version of Vietnam depicted in ""Kong: Skull Island"" has the costumes, musics, and all the other trappings of just about every other memorable Vietnam film you can think of (from ""Apocalypse Now"" to ""Born on the Fourth of July""), but it kind of just blew my mind out uncomplicated this war was presented. World War II has seen a lot of entertaining sci-fi and horror mash-ups, from Michael Mann's ""The Keep"" to Disney's ""Bedknobs & Broomsticks"" as well as lesser underrated films like ""The Final Countdown"" or ""Zone Troopers."" There are so many of this sort of film that there's even an entire Wikipedia page dedicated to it. As for Vietnam, I think filmmakers stayed away from making light of that war because it was such a damaging war to our nation, not just politically and militarily, but culturally. Seeing the Vietnam War portrayed so differently in a blockbuster summer popcorn film made me realize that maybe we've reached a point in history where we've put enough distance between ourselves and that nearly 50-year old war, with three generations (Gen-X, Millenials, and Generation Z) who did not grow up with this war being part of their lives. It reminds me of the old Mark Twain quote, ""Humor is tragedy plus time."" For better or for worst, enough time must have passed now for Vietnam to now be fun. But I digress. Now Kong smashes things real good, fighting giant snakes and all sorts of other made up creatures. The CGI effects are excellent, but I'm a grouchy old man about CGI effects. I really want my giant movie monsters to either be men in monster suits crushing miniature sets or to be stop-motion animation. Computer generated animation takes me out of films and might as well be cartoon animation as far as I'm concerned. CGI works for backgrounds and explosions, but it doesn't work for for living people, animals, or creatures. Still, despite my annoyances with Hollywood's overuse of CGI, ""Kong: Skull Island"" is pretty fun for a number of reasons, but primarily because of it's excellent cast and it's unpretentiously fun action and adventure, which comes off as a nice old fashioned adventure yarn, which is exactly what you need in a retelling of classic monster movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Not exactly a ""remake"", but contains much of the premise of finding Kong.","My wife and I watched this at home on BluRay, and of course the picture and sound are flawless. Not only the direct sound and the ample surround sounds, but also great use of a deep bass subwoofer track. Saw it again October 2018 and enjoyed it as much the second time.This Kong movie deviates quite far from the 1933 ""King Kong"" which culminates in Manhattan with Kong climbing the Empire State building. In this version modern (1973) satellite images discover a previously unknown island, they called it Skull Island. A small group of explorers convince a Senator to fund a trip so that a competing country doesn't get there before a USA expedition.The mission includes military men and Army helicopters and their first encounter with this giant of an ape doesn't go very well. With all helicopters downed and many killed, those on the ground must find a way to get to a prearranged rescue spot on the north side of the island.Tom Hiddleston as James Conrad was recruited for his fighting skills. Samuel L. Jackson is the hard-nosed officer Preston Packard. Pretty Brie Larson is in the movie as eye candy, as experienced correspondent photographer Mason Weaver. She was using an authentic period Leica camera and really was taking photos during filming.As they are moving through the forest of the island they encounter John C. Reilly as Hank Marlow, a soldier who had been on the island for 28 years, since WW2, and knew nothing about the outside world but became their key to escape the island.There are many battles with giant prehistoric beasts of various sorts that have survived on the island, Kong actually is the one who keeps them in check, keeps them from overcoming the world. It was filmed in some really exotic, beautiful areas of Vietnam.An interesting and entertaining take on the Kong story.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Everything looks amazing for a big dumb adventure like it is,"Yet another ""useful"" reboot, also promoted as origin story... because movie buffs haven't surely seen enough of those, yeah?It doesn't even make much sense to create an origin story for Kong because his movies have always explained the origins... but they did it anyway. For the bigger purpose to add the king ape into the newest Godzilla reboot.You do remember 2014's mediocre ""Godzilla"", starring Bryan Cranston, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Ken Watanabe et al? You don't? Hopefully you will still like to see the sequel Godzilla: King of Monsters"" coming in 2019 March, where G and Kong will meet finally (again).Anyway, about the experience at hand. Skull Island"" reaches wide cinema release this weekend. It's probably partially an experiment, to see how early in the year the masses are ready to shell out their hard-earned for run-of-the-mill epics usually more suitable for summer season.The movie cost 190 million dollars and I am glad to report that the producers have put this for good use.Everything looks amazing and for a big dumb adventure like this, there's unusually big and varied line of actresses/ actors. Casting team has done a fine job indeed.We have:* some always super-solid supporting star players (John Goodman, Samuel L. Jackson),* an acclaimed indie actress offering some feminine beauty (Brie Larson),* also always-reliable surprise player who can do both drama and comedy (John C. Reilly),* and a bunch of good likable actors that you are sure you know from somewhere, even if you can't recall the names (such as Tom Hiddleston – Loki from Thor"", Corey Hawkins, John Ortiz, Toby Kebbell – doubling as a motion capture actor for Kong, Shea Whigham et al).The only odd choice is to criminally underuse China's rising star actress Tian Jing. She's here but can't do much. She's not used to add beauty, she's not gonna offer some kick-ass action scenes as in The Great Wall"" alongside Matt Damon. Why cast her at all if you have no need for her?What's surprising is that actors are not here just to hold our attention between grand action setpieces. Their performances have heart and persuasiveness which is something of an achievement, considering that much of their acting time was probably spent in front of the empty green canvas.John C. Reilly is the main man here actually, he has the meatiest character and also the side-mission to act as a comic relief without turning into a joke.As usual, I love him and what he does with the material. Just the perfect balance between obscure, funny and crazy.The monsters look awesome as well and meeting them is worth your time and ticket money. I watched Kong: Skull Island"" in IMAX and 3D, and both have actually been put to good use here. But I am sure everything looks good in standard"" 2D as well.""Skull Island"" sure is a looker, not only monsters and fighting but the locations as well which make everything look truly epic. Filmed in Hawaii, Vietnam and Australia by the way.The only reason I am not willing to give the result a higher score is the screenplay. It's just a bunch of old tired clichés and, to add insult to the injury, the story has been left to sit uncomfortably between two different chairs in at least two important aspects.Firstly, the story's is too clichéd and unoriginal to really grab any adult viewer BUT there's too much violence to gladly recommend it as a family thing. Secondly, the plot moves constantly between being very serious and just light-hearted which makes it uneven and sometimes hard to take.In my mind, they should have modernized soldier characters, right now it feels like anachronism – something from old Kong movies.The army marches in and just tries to destroy everything which feels pretty disgusting in the enlightened"" times of 21st century. If it wasn't all so serious, at least it could be taken as social commentary or black comedy or something.Even Jurassic's and Godzilla's latest outings have fresh-er approach to monster movies which involves more than senseless killing.So you will get an odd combo where mindless destruction alternates with light-hearted adventure. Is it really proper approach for PG-13 family movie? Am I too sensitive here?",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Kong has returned but not with a bang,"Inspired by many movies Jordan Vogt-Roberts has brought Kong: Skull Island. Though the largest ape to ever live (At least in movies) was so popular in Hollywood and appeared time to time on the screens was last seen in 2005 with Peter Jackson behind the script. Jordan has given some new colors to the original Kong with a modulated script.Unlike other Kong movies or monster movie you don't have to wait long to meet Kong instead he shows up in the first scene itself. Though Kong's screen presence is reduced, still he impresses us whenever he shows up. The fights between Kong and the other monsters are a treat to watch.Since frame one the movie is on the script. The character introductions are crisp and fast. We land in Skull Island within the first 15 minutes into the movie. The enchanting visuals keep the audience hooked. Jordan along with Larry Fong has captured the island with some appealing visuals. The slow motion effect adds up to the excitement.The monsters that pop up time to time enthralls and we could here wows now and then in the theatre. The final battle between Kong and the Skull Crawler is the top notch. Apart from all the background score is the best thing I enjoyed about the movie. The songs like Jefferson Airplane (""White Rabbit""), Black Sabbath (""Paranoid""), Creedence Clearwater Revival (""Bad Moon Rising"") and David Bowie (""Ziggy Stardust"") were used to perfection.Lags: Though the movie is great up to some extend it does have many down falls. The story doesn't fall in line and the editing adds up to the misery. Few forced scenes might raise our doubt over the perfection of the movie.The movie has a strong cast, but except Samuel L. Jackson and John C. Reily no one has much to offer (Only for marketing). Apart from all Kong is not so emotional this time which is rather unlikely in Kong movies. He just shares a brief moment with Brie where she touches him, but that isn't emotional.At times some funny one liners are thrown in but fades before it settles down. The slow motion effect is good, but a little too much.Final words: Lags apart Kong: Skull Island is a must watch if you love monster movies. Children would love it and are advised to watch it with parent – The movie is violent (A little). The post credits show that more monster movies are to follow and next time it would be a fight between Godzilla and the Kong.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Monstrous Epicness for the Ape Minded,"Were you disappointed by the amount of screen time by the giant lizard in Godzilla? I have good news for you: the big ape of Kong: Skull Island hits the screen immediately before the opening credits in all his grandness, and appears constantly throughout the film with constant action and explosions in the mix. Yet even without the ape on screen all the time, the amount of swords, flames, helicopters, bombs, and Skullcrushers satisfactorily draw out everything moment by moment in an approach comparative to various scenes in Apocalypse Now.So whether if you're a millennial or a baby boomer, the action should satisfy. Standard to the tradition of Skull Island, other behemoths are accompanied to confront both Kong and the humans in search for him. These camouflaged beasts include a swamp ox, a log insect, a giant spider amongst a bamboo forest, reptilian birds, and a kraken who becomes Kong's dinner. Other colorful sights on this god forsaken island range from the mesmerizing northern lights to the horrific pale-tinted mass grave of great ape skeletons, creating a believable look to a testing world against man's successes.Would such an experience keep you talking in the long run? Will you get pumped for Kong's eventual confrontation against Godzilla?Well, let's rewind the clock to answer that question, shall we?As the movie starts, a World War II soldier crash lands on a deserted island in 1944, only to come face to sword against a Japanese warrior. Compared to past King Kong movies, this slightly different period setting receives a rather poor treatment; I mean, when the first five minutes persuades us to cheer on a US soldier fighting against one of the Pearl Harbor bombers, has racism really changed at all by 2017 standards?Then the opening credits shows historical footage of man's scientific progress up until 1973. Then we see a researcher intent on proposing a government-funded trip to an unexplored destination named ""Skull Island,"" the one island God did not finish creating. They compare it to the Bermuda Triangle, as nobody has ever come back alive. So right at the Vietnam War's end, a team of US soldiers, investigators, and a photographer set out to explore. Eventually they find the same soldier who crash landed in 1944, and introduce the old soldier to the worlds' robust change since he left humanity, and team up with him to head back home. Although could man really be king here? Especially when the castaway tribe worships a 200 foot tall ape?Kong may be an epic time for all you men out there, but you ladies may be napping once or twice, as your only mode of connection is Oscar winner Brie Larson (Room, Short Term 12), who exists here purely to play THAT kind of female lead. You know, the one who exists just so women have a celebrity name to gush over. The one who gets wet while wearing a skimpy gray tank top. If you're still not underwhelmed, what if I told you about her romantic subplot, one that meets absolutely no resolution?You may not even notice any predictable romantic subplot anyway, as there are so many millimeter thick cardboard cutout characters, none of which have a proper introduction to tell you who they are as human beings. Some of them are even there purely for comic relief's sake. The large cast's screen time balance of screen time has so little attention, you don't feel any hint of tension or sorrow whenever one of them gets killed or mauled.Now one question still remains: how will it be when Kong has to fight Godzilla in 2020? I can absolutely presume the fight will be epic. I mean, if Kong can deliver the nonstop action and cinematic grandness we asked for, while also learning its lessons from 2014's Godzilla, then it should turn out entertaining enough.On the other hand, if you prefer a much deeper story featuring characters who are worth cheering on, then you'd probably be better off watching Peter Jackson's version as opposed to investing in future films similar to Kong: Skull Island. It may not be a particularly good movie, nor was it trying to be, but it's still a pretty sweet thrill ride!",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A visual spectacle with bland hollow characters.,"6/10 Overall Kong: Skull Island is a visual spectacle with bland hollow characters. The cinematography of the island is very pretty and with the exception of few scenes look very real. Yet, all the characters, with the exception of Samuel L. Jackson and John C Reilly, are fairly basic. Brie Larson doesn't get much to do which is a shame and Tom Hiddleston has a cool action scene but have no depth as a character. Some of the decisions made by the characters made little sense and had me and my friends puzzled and laughing at some stupid moments. I like the island and all the different monsters, especially Kong. Kong is the best part of the film, and every scene with him is very good. Though they hardly go into the ""humanity"" of Kong which previous versions, Peter Jackson's 2005 King Kong particularly, did very well. Overall I enjoyed the film, but wish there was more in the character department for me to connect with. Bring the popcorn and stay to the end of the credits.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Kong is King,"I loved this movie, it was better than I thought it would be... and I thought it would be just okay. It gets going quickly and does not mess around with a bunch of nonsense. No time is wasted as the movie gets into motion and the wheels start rolling. John C Reilly is so good, one of the best. Samuel L Jackson was not great, i didn't like him in this role. I kept thinking of his lines from Pulp Fiction every time he spoke. I kept thinking he would shout out a similar line to his Snakes on a Plane signature remark. The rest of the cast was okay but some of the characters were unnecessary. That was no problem as the action spoke louder than the chance of any ruination of a movie by the same old Armageddon,Prometheus, & Interstellar dumb crew members on a super serious mission.I like the 1976 and 2005 King Kong movies too, but this one is my new favorite. I read in many reviews here that if you like this movie you must be a real dummy. I don't get why anyone would say that. This was better than the last two Godzilla movies any way you slice it. I saw this at an IMAX in Real D and it blew me away. I'll buy it on DVD when it comes out on DVD. Let the haters hate, because I predict word of mouth is going to make this a very successful film. Many people will say it was better than they thought it would be. Give it a chance, you might say that too. P.S. - the music was great, basically likened to the soundtrack of Forrest Gump but not as many total songs. One great song I actually didn't even recognize as the crew headed near the beginning of the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Disappointing,"The movie felt so uninspired. Compared to other Kong films, he had zero personality in this film. Other than being huge, Kong actually seemed bored. The 2005 film, of which I was not that crazy about, at least it made Kong feel alive and interesting...This storyline was very minimal. Other than the old WW II pilot, everyone seemed rigid or stereotyped . And none of them actually showed much awe with what they have encountered.

Quite entertaining but doubtful it will stand the test of time,"Kong Skull Island is enjoyable to watch. From an easy plot, interesting characters to the allure of the mighty Kong himself this film should satisfy. If you've had a long day and just want to watch a movie this would be the right choice. However it appears quite forgettable in terms of the other Kong movies and other films in general.King Kong has been a cinematic classic for a long time. The different story line sadly was not better than the original. The ancient people who inhabit the island and live in Kong's protection pales in comparison to the classic Kong being transported to New York and climbing to a skyscraper with the female he's fallen for as he battles planes. Peter Jackson's remake and the 1933 original are better in plot. The unusual romance was so grand and remarkable to watch.The CGI and special effects for Kong were interesting. The mythical creature closely resembled an erect male which questioned its realism. Jackson was more realistic in his portrayal of an actual beast like Kong and 1933 cannot be cited so much because special effects were limited to what they are now. In 2017 it was surprisingly unimpressive, I have a feeling that in years to come this Kong might be used as an example of how limited the effects were in the past and how far they have later come. In all these respects it definitely will be forgettable and its rating on this site might drop over time.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Creatures galore,You get a lot for your buck here - not just King Kong but a whole bunch of giant animals and insects. And the effects are good so the fighting between the animals is quite something. It's also quite a violent movie with a pretty high body count - feels like a Vietnam War movie. The filming was in fact in Vietnam and Hawaii and it's quite beautiful and exotic.Brie Larson is good for this role not annoying and believable. Tom Hiddleston is miscast - like some Engish gentleman on a hunt. Out of place. Samuel is a good match as Kong's adversary. And John C Reilly is good in this role for a change. There is a sense of adventure and a variety of scenarios and creatures that sets it apart from another Jurassic style adventure.,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Entertaining and well done!,"""Kong: Skull Island"" and ""The Great Wall"". These two films have something in common. And I do not mean only the actress Jing Tian, present in both and Legendary Entertainment, as one of the producing companies for both films. I refer in particular the monsters and the ""very special""(I mean, very good) special effects. They look very well in both movies. Even Samuel L. Jackson, present in the last period of time in all the films made on Planet Earth(which kinda annoys me...) plays a little better than usual (same histrionic). A piece of very precious advice: don't go to watch it in 3D, Kong might jump out of the screen and you may be very very frightened. But, that would be nothing. It is very possible that the huge and ugly lizard will jump too out of the big screen and will definitely bite your ass...",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Kong Skull Island: Yet another unneeded return to an old franchise,"I've never liked the Kong movies, not a single one sadly. Quite frankly if I wanted to see a big dumb hairy ape pounding its chest and behaving like it's something special I'd watch a movie from the Green Street franchise.This is yet another feature with a competent cast but too much emphasis on sfx which don't actually even look as good as I expected.So it's Loki, Nick Fury and Ms Marvel vs a host of oversized creatures including cliché looking skull....stalkers? I can't even remember what he called them, I just remember cringing and wondering why was on the Scyfy Channel.The most concerning part is that the two most entertaining scenes in the entire movie are one during the credits and the modern day obligated after credits moment. They were worth watching, the rest of the film not so much.Skull Island isn't bad, it's just all so samey with nothing new brought to the table. We have the knives, we have the forks, we have a little bread basket full of warm refreshing buns, we have our glass of water and we have our meal but where is my caramel pizza & chocolate flavoured wine?

A lot of potential.,"Honestly, I felt that the atmosphere and the setting of the movie was superb. The script not so much. There was not enough ""content"" in the movie, despite the long duration of the movie. There could have been much more ""drama"" included to make it more interesting and to really grasp the attention of the audience. Sure, the effects were cool and Kong was a beast (not just literally). But would I really recommend this movie? Probably not.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Tribute To Hollywood Unoriginality,"If you want a bang-slam action movie, there are lots of them. If you want this one, be prepared to suspend a LOT of belief in the power of modern ordinance.

6.5/10 definitely worth seeing much better than you'd expect,"This is one of those films you think won't live up to the hype and the first quarter was so poor it was looking like a 3/10 but my friend I went with said 8.5/10 at that point and at the end the best film she'd seen this year , better than LION . So it just goes to show there's a film for everyone out there .Once the silliness was over with and you're able to accept the sheer unreality of the script, after all it's about a giant ape ,it's better once you give it a bit of leeway .Once they get to the island things improve after the on screen arrival of John C Reily who adds humour to the film . There's eye candy for the girls in the form of Tom Hiddleson and the chaps are bound to notice Brie Larsons skimpy vest getting tighter and wetter as the film proceeds .There is also plenty of action , plenty of jumps , the CGI is amazing , if i'd seen this in 3D it would have probably scored 7.5/10It's definitely worth seeing.

An inconsistent film,"This movie flits between action/comedy and action/drama. It works well as the former, not so well as the latter. In the opening act and the denouement during the closing credits, when the film tries to take itself too seriously all of the flaws in the film become grating and distracting. When it is more of a comedic adventure, the flaws are not as noticeable and forgiven by the viewer. There are so many ridiculous aspects to this film that it can only work as a comedy, and John C Reilly excels in this department, in fact he brings the film to life and I started to view it as a bit of a humorous satire and thought all the opening cliches were actually meant to be clumsy and annoying; suddenly the film worked for me. Then the cringeworthy and unnecessary homecoming scene almost undid all that sentiment. Great CGI and action sequences; entertaining.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's hard to hate a movie that wants nothing more than to take you on a ride . . . Giant ride that is.,"Jordan Vogt-Roberts (of the Sundance breakout The Kings of Summer previously) delivered a fresh, new experience that honours the essential elements of the iconic character and provides big, monster movie matinée for an epic fun-time. Written by Dan Gilroy (Nightcrawler), Max Borenstein (2014's Godzilla), and Derek Connolly (Jurassic World), the movie follows a team of scientists, soldiers, and adventurers on a journey to explore a mythical, uncharted island in the Pacific, as dangerous as it is beautiful.If it was only spectacle and size that defined a great genre movie then 'Kong: Skull Island' would have had it all- unfortunately that's not the case. Size does matter, but not over and above aspects of story-telling and technicalities other than CGI, that help make a movie experience more real and involving. The representation of Kong as protector to the native tribesmen , other dwarfed inhabitants and aggressor to the bunched -up rest who puts his survival in peril, is also not clearly drawn. How does Kong differentiate between one human and the next, especially when they all come from the same group who invaded his island and made an attempt on his life? That's a question left unanswered.Although none of that should bother you.It's hard to hate on a movie that wants nothing more than to take you on a ride, and that's precisely what Kong: Skull Island does. With some truly jaw-dropping visuals from director of photography Larry Fong (of Watchmen, Lost, Super 8, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice), a colourful cast of thin but endearing characters, and some of the most bad-ass Kong action committed to the screen, Kong: Skull Island is a solidly entertaining entry in the ape's ever-expanding lore. And be sure to stay after the credits for a little tease at what's to come next from the ""MonsterVerse."" My inner-child was grinning ear-to- ear.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Truly the epitome of cinematic GARBAGE,"COMMUNITY SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT RE: KONG If you have seen any of the King Kong movies made in the past, ANY, including the Joe Young one, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY going to see this newest rendition. It is truly the epitome of cinematic GARBAGE. We, who have seen prior Kong films know that the central theme is the romantic battle between ape and man for woman. This is crucial for a Kong flick. Without this, there is no essence, no point to the film, unless it is now wanton carnage and stupid acting. Even during the one 30 moment of mechanical romantic interlude where the girl, in absolute FEMBOT manner, touches the face of Kong, the stupid ape could not get that ""Straight Outta Compton"" look off his face! Next rant, the acting. Samuel L. Jackson, if this is what you've been reduced to, go home. Retire. Join a Tibetan monastery and never show your face again out of shame. Final rant, though I could go on and on, the villagers. All I can say is they are smoking some very powerful hash and the chief's wife looks like Kermit THE Frog's mother. Now, if you're a youngster and/or have never seen any of the prior Kong films, you MIGHT find this wasted space of time tolerable. But a word of advice to all.

Kong still has an eye for the ladies,"This King Kong story has the big guy never leaving Skull Island. But with Brie Larson along the big guy still has an eye for the ladies though he never becomes obsessed like he was with Fay Wray.It's the end of the Vietnam War, but John Goodman who's a Frank Buck type hunter and explorer with some Capitol Hill influence has gotten the government to underwrite an expedition to a newly discovered uncharted island. He's even gotten the cooperation of the government in this endeavor. An airborne squadron of paratroopers headed by Colonel Samuel L. Jackson are to give him support. These troops ain't real happy as their going stateside is being delayed.This island has all kinds of strange monsters, prehistoric hunter/gatherers. and a big ape who watches over the people and the walled stockade they've built to prevent them from being the lunch special for the monsters. They will need all that military firepower to stay alive and as you can gather very few make it out alive.One thing though, this ain't Jurassic Park where a lot of plant eating dinosaurs are around. Everybody here is a flesh eater. No wonder that vegetation is so lush and so treacherous.Kong: Skull Island I suspect will get a nomination or two in the technical categories next year.

"A Fun Kong Film, but doesn't Live up to Godzilla (2014)","Just to say, Godzilla (2014) is my favorite film in the world to be honest, I loved the characterization and the build up to one of the most epic third acts in movie history, people may say it had little Godzilla and too much character. So the creators of Kong: Skull Island listened.Kong Skull Island is pack with great sequences... when Kong is in the picture, its so much fun seeing him kick more monster butt on the big screen again, and the characters John C Reilly and Samuel Jackson are both great and shine in this film, and personally I thought Tom Hiddleston was a cool bad-ass who had little characterization, but lived up with his tricks.The problems are, them three I mentioned were the only ones with characterization, maybe Toby Kebball but I didn't care. The Characters are lame and bore me, I just wanted Kong, I wanted to love these characters like in Godzilla, that's why it never bored me. Another problem is, as I loved how Godzilla (2014) teased you from the beginning of a big fight but never showed adding anticipation, which is why the final battle is so AMAZING, due to its build up, if we already earlier on saw Godzilla fight, we would think ""well... I've already seen this"" But in this it shows too much Kong kicking ass that it ruined the final battle, don't worry I loved the scenes, its just that I didn't recognize that near the end, that this was a final battle as it was just the same as the earlier scenes, so it didn't wow me.But that end credits scene.... IS WORTH SPENDING ALL YOUR MONEY TO SEE Overall, it was okay and fun at points, just with big mistakes I hope they learn from it, as they seemed to listen to the Godzilla feedback. I rate this a 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Great monster fights, very dull humans. The  (almost) perfect monster movie.","A 15-story ape throws a palm tree like a dart through the windshield of a Vietnam-era Huey with Creedence Clearwater Revival playing in the background.And that's just the first thing Kong does.If all you want is more stuff like that, plus some amazing monster on monster battles, then this is the movie for you. If you're looking for compelling human characters to go with those fights, then you walked into the wrong auditorium.Kong:Skull Island is the second film in the still-forming Monsterverse, the first being 2014's Godzilla. As such, there are several threads to tie these two films together. Don't worry, there are no real spoilers here.Of course, the main point of this film is to see King Kong fight some monsters, but the story before that involves John Goodman's character, an agent of Monarch, the monster organization from Godzilla, lead an expedition to Skull Island. Ostensibly, they are there to survey an uncharted island that's been inaccessible for centuries, but as the humans soon discover there's more to the mission than first thought.To qualify the opening statement, this film is really not about any of the people shown. As such, no character is given any real development or subtext except for John C. Reilly's character, a stranded World War II fighter pilot named Marlow (read as reference to Apocalypse Now, which this film clearly emulates, down to its Vietnam-era setting and themes.) At times, the human characters get their brief hints at deep moments, dragging the scenes out too long, until some are inevitably killed by one creature or another.However, by far the best parts of this film are the creatures. Obviously Kong is the main creature, and the CGI work on him is incredibly detailed. But the other creatures as well, such as a giant water buffalo, giant spiders, and especially the lizard-like Skullcrawlers, are all entertaining to look at whether the humans are (trying) to kill them or Kong is bashing them apart.This film is really about the monsters, as well it should be. All of the great monster movies of old followed the same basic set-up. Some human story that gets characters to go on some vaguely-defined mission that quickly falls out of importance in favor of epic battle scenes between two or more monsters, broken up every so often by more human scenes which serve only as a rest break for the audience between battle scenes.This film follows that model to a tee, and in a sense is a response to criticism of 2014's Godzilla which had hardly any great battle scenes between Godzilla and the MUTOs, and too much human interaction with characters we didn't necessarily care about.The humans do indeed take more of a back seat in Kong, and there are way more creature battles and action scenes. However, the humans still have slightly too much screen time, and at these times the movie plods.Nevertheless, this film is worth it for the creature battles alone, and the end credit scene which reveals so much tantalizing promise for the future.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Bigger doesn't mean better.,"Skull Island features the biggest Kong yet, a towering 100 ft tall primate able to swat helicopters from the sky like flies. But bigger doesn't necessarily mean better: while this latest great ape adventure is a slight improvement over Peter Jackson's bloated 2005 remake of the '33 classic, it's a monster movie desperately in need of a decent plot. The special effects laden action sequences cannot fail to impress, but the story does not.The extremely basic screenplay takes a group of scientists and soldiers, has them embark on an expedition to the titular uncharted island, where they encounter Kong, who knocks them for six. The survivors must make their way to a rendezvous point on the North side of the island, avoiding being eaten by a variety of massive creatures or getting trodden on by the oversized simian. And that's about it. Kong battles a giant octopus, a massive crab/spider attacks the humans, vicious birds swoop out the sky, and nasty lizard creatures crawl from beneath the island's surface, all of which is mindlessly entertaining, but not in the least bit inspired.5.5 out of 10, rounded up to 6 for token eye candy Brie Larson, who strips to a figure hugging vest in an attempt to distract viewers from the lack of fresh ideas.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Entertaining, but lacked a sense of awe and mystery","It was OK. I expected more from it, but what worked was the re-introduction of King Kong. The way he was handled was all right. I did overall liked this portrayal of Kong, he was more fierce and visceral. Even though I would have liked the movie to develop him more, since almost all of his scenes are about him doing action stuff. The very few moments when he calms down and lives normally were nice. But there wasn't enough for me to really buy into it and understand him. Because the other ""King Kong"" films do a good job of humanizing Kong so he doesn't become a generic evil monster. What makes him different compared to a lot of movie monsters is that he has a heart and some kind of emotional connection. This film would have needed to showcase more of that aspect of Kong's personality.They went the safe route with the story. I's pretty standard and predictable. It bugged me a bit because I wished they would go in a different direction. Well, they did go in a different direction... With the visual style and the tone. It's a fun and colorfully energized type of movie that doesn't take itself seriously often. I liked the few times it actually toned down and got more serious. Because a big thing this film lacked was a sense of awe and mystery. They show off Kong early on, so there's no time to build up the reveal. I like the Peter Jackson version a lot more because there's eeriness and mystery surrounding Skull Island. Just hearing about the legends of the creatures and exploring the mythology was something that I could get invested in. They leave nothing a mystery in this new film because there's much exposition on what's going on with Kong, his backstory and the different creatures on the island. Instead of gradually exploring it or having the audience realize things along the way, they spell it all out by talking about everything and not showing. Towards the final half they have some mysterious moments, but by then it was already too late for that. It spends more time trying to be retro and looking for moments to play songs from the 70's, rather than giving us a good story. The best character was John C. Reilly. I liked his story line, it was nice. Everyone else was just there basically playing themselves. Many actors were wasted. I'm looking at you Toby Kebbel. You are better than this.There is a Post-credit scene. It was OK, but underwhelming. It does promise a lot for the future and I hope they don't mess up anything they are hinting at, because it has huge potential. ""Kong: Skull Island"" is just an entertaining popcorn movie, don't expect much more. I'm happy that King Kong is back, but he deserves a better movie next time.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Never, have so many people survived a helicopter crash","A long row of endlessly bad decisions Starting with casting Samuel Jackson in anything. It's basically the same old King Kong story,only the location has changed. Humans find king Kong,and first thought & reaction is, kill king Kong.And from than on,it's all downhillBut this time, with a politically correct cast.1 Asian 2-3 black guys 1 white Women.1 Hispanic nerd,1 white guy.And that is only the lead characters.Samuel Jackson plays the same character he plays in every movie these days.The over the top lager than life,I'm-so-tough-even-god -is -afraid of-me. Not one of the the entire crew are likable,nor relatable. Not to mention the number of helicopters,seem to grow while they are fighting.They start with 4 than they seem to be up to 8 or 9+a ChinookOne of the MANY things that makes this movie so bad,is that they have made Kong the main Enemy,the big bad.So to speak.You get to see very little of other creatures that could be dangerous for tiny humans. The survivors from the crash,pretty much act like it's a walk in the park.Every place they should have the sense walk around, they walk through.They also never run out of ammunition..Which get really comical. cause they basically empty a clip, in everything they see.OH Yeah.Did I forgot to mention they suddenly midway through a battle ,have 50cal finished mounted with tripod an everything,the precise moment Jackson tell them they need it.Even though two sec. ago they were on the run. Only problem is,up until that moment,nobody was carrying anything that heavy.The plot holes are just endless.Along with the incredibly bad decisions, made by Jackson,who is suppose to be a superb commanding officer. The problem with having Jackson in anything,is that he is to expensive to be killed off. So you know you'll have to suffer him the entire movie",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Old wine in a new bottle,"I watched Kong in IMAX and it was fun. This resulted in images projected by Dual Projectors on the Giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen of IMAX, along with 12000 Watts IMAX proprietary sound system that will make your hairs stand each time Kong growls and pounds his chest!The sole purpose is to set-up a supposed Kong vs. Godzilla film in the coming years, otherwise, the script is too weak, on the same sidelines of Jurassic World. No care was taken for character development. Also, it's not clear whether the focus is on the the ape or on the island itself. There is quite a bit of humor that is attempted here, but most of it comes out of nowhere and seems desperate. Samuel Jackson strikes the right tone of crazy amid the chaos, otherwise, if we check the rest of the casting crew, the acting is almost one-dimensional. The action and visuals are dazzling and immersive. Neither a sequel nor prequel, but the SFX are better, especially with Kong's CGI' close-ups. And there is no love-dove like the Naomi Watts- Kong relationship. There is some fun to be had and it's not a bad film in any way, but a film like this could have been so much better. In a nutshell, Kong: Skull Island is disposable popcorn mumbo-jumbo fare. My significant digit score: 6.4/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not boring but not great,"Felt like a jigsaw made up from parts of other, superior films. All the characters were stereotypes, barely developed, so you couldn't care much when they got eaten/shot/torn apart. And it was set in some mythical, post-racial and totally non-sexist 70s where hardly anybody smoked anything, not even tobacco.That said - the island settings convinced, there were some good laughs, and the monsters and the US military were so scary you were soon rooting for Kong to sort them both out.

No Question: 10 out of 10,"This isn't a horror movie, it's a war movie, with an ape incidental to the plot...and it ends the way we've always wanted this particular movie to end. (I hope this isn't considered a SPOILER)Beginning with the opening credits, displayed in a unique and original style setting the stage and explaining the plot while rapidly spanning from 1944 to 1973 as the cast is shown, the story leaps directly into the action, without all the talky exposition, while the end credits promise Things to Come. This is not only an exciting action adventure flick, but also a beautifully photographed film. Part of it is reminiscent of the WW2 movie A Walk in the Sun, and there will be many pointing out a resemblance in tone to Apocalypse Now.There were characters I hoped would survive and regretted when they didn't. A good many of them play against type, which is refreshing. Juxtaposition of some shots foreshadow later scenes. The parallels between scenes of Col. Packard and Kong in body language isn't to be missed and definitely points out these two characters' relationship.AS for the monsters themselves...original, imaginative, and definitely deadly. (Loved the giant water buffalo, by the way.) Beautiful scenery and creative filming, with unusual camera angles aren't to be missed. If I were asked,I'd nominate the cinematographer as well as the special effects people for Oscars. Having seen ALL the Kong films, from the original to the Jack Black version (which I also like in spite of critics views to ebb contrary), I easily give this one 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Entertaining enough but not the best Kong movie,"It seems that you can't keep a giant ape down and this is at least the fourth Kong movie that I've seen following the versions of ""King Kong"" released in 1933, 1976 and 2005. What makes this one different? It channels ""Apocalypse Now"" big time, setting the action just after the Vietnam War and deploying a group of GIs from that conflict led by a bombastic lieutenant colonel who insists ""This is one war we're not gonna lose"" (yeh).Stupidly they start by carpet bombing Skull Island in the same way that the Americans did Vietnam with the same effect, except that this time it's not the Vietcong who are enraged but ugly, giant reptiles. I suppose another difference is that special effects have moved on, even in the decade since the last Kong movie, and there are some striking visuals and impressive CGI, but this effort is nowhere near as effective as Peter Jackson's 2005 blockbuster.The plot is minimal and the script often dire. Kong appears far too early and is not characterised as well as the three other films. And there is a massive waste of cinematic talent with the likes of John Goodman, John C Reilly, Tom Huddleston and Samuel L Jackson under-utilised and/or under- stretched, no more so than with the one female role where the talents of Brie Larson - recent Academy Award winner for ""Room"" - are squandered.If you sit through endless credits, you'll see a clip which appears to be setting up a sequel in which Kong faces off with Godzilla (apparently in a 2020 release).

Very Fun Monster Movie,"I love me a good monster movie.And, KONG: SKULL ISLAND is a very good, very entertaining monster movie.Directed by relative newcomer Jordan Vogt-Roberts, KONG: SKULL ISLAND delivers pretty much what you expect - a group of explorers (with Military escorts) descend upon the mysterious Skull Island to find out what's there and what they find are monsters...plenty of monsters...with Kong as King of the Island.I applaud the restraint that this film shows.  The action is first rate, but not over the top, the CGI is very, very good and the laughs are plenty enough to keep you entertained.  It is stylish, but not overly so.  Adventurous, but not too daring.  CGI fight- filled, but not overblown.  The quick-cut, shaky cam that is so prevalent in other films is kept to a minimum here and the monsters are sizable enough for the average audience member to understand without getting overwhelmed by it.But it is the use of the actors that really stands out.Starting with the casting of John Goodman as the head of the group heading to the island and good ol' Samuel L. Jackson as the head of the Military team that goes in.  Instantly, the audience recognizes and understands their generic characters - based on the history of characters that these two have played - and it is like eating comfort food.  Add to this, Tom Hiddleston (Loki in the Marvel films) and Brie Larson (soon to be CAPTAIN MARVEL) as our hero and heroine, and we have a top 4 that are easy to watch and comforting in their presence.Now...add onto these 4...solid supporting characters.  From John Ortiz and Marc Evan Jackson as ""Corporate Suits"" caught in the fray to soldiers Shea Whigham, Jason Mitchell and Toby Kebbell (who also - magnificently - does the motion capture work as Kong) to Corey Hawkins and Tian Jing as young scientists, all do solid work, not a weak performance in the bunch.But the real surprise to me is the  wonderful, fun, turn by John C. Reilly as an Air Force pilot who has been stranded on the island for decades.  I blow hot and cold with Mr. Reilly's antics.  He can be very good and sympathetic (Boogey Nights, Chicago) or he can be bland when trying to be over-the-top zany (anything he does when he tries to match zany performance with Will Ferrell) but here he finds the right balance in fun, energy, pathos and grit.  He is, truly, the character I ended up rooting for in this filmClearly, the Producers (paired with the successful 2014 GODZILLA film), see a potential ""Cinematic Universe"" with these 2 characters.  Make sure you stay for the important scene at the end of the end credits - not just the ""home movies"" that are shown during the credits, but the actual scene at the end - and you will see how this film fits into the previous film and how they will be connected going forward.I, for one, am looking forward to more adventures in this Universe.Letter Grade: a solid B+8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Yes, it's a popcorn film but a popcorn film that has a great bit. Kong was in it more then I expected and the creatures in the film didn't disappoint. It has one of my top five monster kills I've ever seen... If you see it... You'll know the one I'm talking about. STAY UNTIL THE END OF THE CREDITS! Everyone left the theater except the two of us...

Save your money,"I hated everything about this movie. Cliques, bad acting and a terribly predictable plot made me face palm and wince throughout its duration. The film has lots of A-list actors but it's hard to tell who acted the best in this film; perhaps it was the ""Skullcrawler"" who seemed to unintentionally or not cut out the BS the movie served you up.All in all, save your money and see a movie actually worth watching, unless you have a kid that wants to be entertained by monsters fighting and things exploding4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Disappointed first time; better the second,"It might be a good idea for reviewers--professional and otherwise--to withhold reviews until they've watched a film at least twice. True, most people will pay movie admission only once, but my experience with film at least, is that in many cases my opinion of a film changes with additional viewings. Having said that, as a fan of Peter Jackson's King Kong--one of my favorites films--I was disappointed when I watched Skull Island (on DVD only). I found the story not particularly engaging, nor the characters particularly likable (except Reilly). However, the monster aspect was great, and that probably is what attracts me to these movies in the first place. I would give those monster encounters a 10, and the rest of the movie a 5, hence a 7. Kong really doesn't come off as a bad guy, and the ending was cute.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Other reviews are crap.,Definitely a great movie. Music is awesome and so are the historical elements of the time period of the 70s. I loved the soundtrack in this movie. Are there a some pot holes? Yes. Its not going to be on top 100 of all time. But the acting is great and if your a war buff and history buff and 70s music buff it is awesome. Definitely a 7/10. the CGI of the fights between Kong and the others is pretty damn good too. I did like the acting a tad better in the jack black Kong but that was much more of a dramatic movie than this was. This is pure action with military fighting and explosives.,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Blows its load too early but saved by some major monster action,"Kong: Skull Island serves as the second film in Legendary's MonsterVerse, following the monster hit that was Godzilla back in 2014. With an up and coming director at the helm, a mightily impressive cast in tow and, of course, the iconic Kong himself on full show, the ingredients were there for this to be another great monster film.When a team of explorers and soldiers venture to an unchartered island in the Pacific, they get more than they bargained for when they realise the island is home to an array of giant creatures, including the mythic Kong.Let's get the few negatives I had with Kong: Skull Island out of the way first. I wasn't particularly a massive fan of how they blew their load too early by showing Kong pretty much within the first fifteen minutes, losing any sense of awe that this iconic monster deserves. Compare it to the way Gareth Edwards built up to Godzilla's reveal and it's almost as if there's a total lack of respect for Kong.Then there are the human characters and the film's screenplay, both void of any real weight. The characters are about as bland as they come and they're matched by some truly uninspired performances from the likes of Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson, who really try their best with some awful dialogue. The most interesting character is Samuel L. Jackson's Preston Packard, who holds a real grudge against Kong however, they miss a chance for Jackson to go fully off the rails and his tirade against Kong comes across as half-hearted. John C. Reilly was the performance most people were worried about in this film but because of how his character is written into the film and the fact he isn't just an annoying joke machine, he is one of the best things about the film.It's easy to say this is a film about Kong so we shouldn't really worry about the human characters. If we are supposed to care about what happens to these characters then there simply has to be something about them for us to give a damn about. Unfortunately, this is a similar problem that Godzilla faced.Kong: Skull Island may be found lacking in some departments but I can't deny that there is still a lot of fun to be had with this film. Jordan Vogt-Roberts' film moves along at such a blistering pace and he certainly shows he can deliver an action sequence. I mentioned that the film lacks a sense of awe, particularly with the film moving from giant beast to giant beast so swiftly, but Vogt-Roberts manages to make amends with the final two set-pieces of the film, the final fight between Kong and a 'skull crawler' being the film's stand-out moment.Kong himself looks fantastic, brought to life through a motion-capture performance from Terry Notary, as do the rest of the visual effects, and the decision to shoot on location in places like Hawaii and Vietnam rather than in a green-screen studio amplifies the great visual effects work on this film, as does Larry Fong's cinematography.I'd have to say Kong: Skull Island left me a little disappointed, even if it does deliver plenty of action and has a post credits scene that left me excited for the future of the MonsterVerse. It certainly made me understand why there was no 'King' included in the title.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Classic monster movie!!,"Kong: Skull Island is a 2017 American monster film; let's be clear this isn't Shakespeare and unlike the dreadful 2014 Godzilla the film doesn't take itself too seriously. The film has the feel of a classic 90s Blockbuster; now depending on your view of 90s Blockbusters this is either a good thing or a bad thing. The film is a rip roaring, funny and fast paced monster movie where the monster gets the same amount of screen time as the rest of the cast. Although this is the cast; Tom Hiddleston as James Conrad, Samuel L. Jackson as Preston Packard, John Goodman as William ""Bill"" Randa, Brie Larson as Mason Weaver, Jing Tian as San Lin, Toby Kebbell as Jack Chapman, John Ortiz as Victor Nieves, Corey Hawkins as Houston Brooks, Jason Mitchell as Glenn Mills, Shea Whigham as Earl Cole, Thomas Mann as Reg Slivko, Eugene Cordero as Reles and John C. Reilly as Hank Marlow. 13 main cast members all vying for 118 minutes worth of screen time.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
great kong action,"The film presents a unique blend of themes and influences, resulting in a somewhat scattered yet distinctive personality with solid setpieces. It's a straight adventure tale featuring colossal monsters, shot in a style reminiscent of B-movies and comic books, evident in its use of Dutch angles and vivid colors. However, the inclusion of a heavy-handed Vietnam metaphor, reminiscent of ""Apocalypse Now,"" and song choices detract from the film's cohesion, serving mainly as a contrived device to contrast Kong's humanity against a villainous portrayal of Sam Jackson.While the characters fulfill their expected roles adequately, many, like Hiddleston and Larson's, feel underdeveloped and easily forgettable. The focus remains on the monsters, most of which are visually stunning and captivating, barring the unremarkable Skullcrawlers, whose introduction scene is cringe-worthy due to poorly delivered dialogue.In comparison to the new Godzilla film, this iteration of Kong stands out as a loud and proud B-movie infused with strong comic book influences, offering entertainment with a distinct style. The potential convergence of these worlds presents an intriguing prospect, as both franchises lend themselves well to an expanded universe. Ultimately, the film's essence aligns with the essence of these franchises - primed for an extended universe that embraces their nature.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Watchable only because of King Kong!!!,"With the help of soldiers, a group of scientists goes on a mission to visit an Island in Southeast Asia. After reaching the Island they start to drop bombs, until someone shows up to fight. This is the second film in the series of monster movies that starts with Godzilla 2014 which is far better than this movie. The failed attempt of character development was the main problem that faces the whole story. The technical team did an excellent job and the actors are all talented. Now comes the King Kong factor which is the only thing that is worth watchable. The intro action scenes and the ending scenes were outstanding. The night scenes look ridiculous in 3D. The Academy award winner Brie Larson is assigned to take pictures in the movie and apart from one stunt scene there is nothing much to do for her. The only reason why she signed this movie is the popularity of King Kong movies, Other than that, I don't know why she acts in this movie. Samuel L Jackson's eye to eye contact with King Kong was unbearable to watch. Overall, it's watchable only because of King Kong and that's the only thing that keeps the movie alive.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A fun monster movie but lacks compelling characters.,"Kong: Skull Island is basically exactly what you'd expect it to be, as long as you're not expecting Apocalypse Now 2. Which, ironically, is often what this film is trying to go for. If I walked into the theater for this movie not knowing at all what it was, the first act (very first scene excluded) would make me think that it was a crappy Vietnam war film with way too many A-list actors. In reality, it is an OK monster movie with way too many A-list actors and absolutely no character development.This film started off pretty badly in all respects, but improved significantly after the actual monster came into the plot. Honestly, the monster and John C. Reilly's character are the only characters that get any real development, which is this movie's biggest problem. There are so many characters in this film, and they are all reduced to stereotypes. Tom Hiddleston is in this film just to be the handsome action hero and Brie Larson is there just to be the sexy main female lead. Larson gets no backstory whatsoever, and Hiddleston is reduced to one line that sounds like it was shoehorned in at the very last second. John Goodman's character has some backstory but he's so annoying it doesn't matter.All of the acting is mediocre, which is a shame because of the quality of actors put in this film. The only good performances are Samuel L. Jackson because he's Samuel L. Jackson, and John C. Reilly because he's occasionally funny. Other than that, good actors can be reduced to rubbish because of the bad script.Of course, this movie isn't complete garbage, and that is mostly because of the all the various monsters and explosions. Say what you will about Kong: Skull Island, but it is entertaining as hell. The monster fights are big and mindless, and that's honestly all anybody asked for when going into this film.If you go into Kong: Skull Island expecting mindless action, then you will most likely love it. However, if you watch it for literally any other reason, then you will find a mediocre monster movie that has been done a million times before.I give Kong: Skull Island a C+.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Spoilers but it's a 7 year old movie: Fun ride that continues to world build,"Kong Skull IslandThe second film in the American Monsterverse, Kong Skull Island continues establishing a world that Godzilla (2014) began 3 years earlier. This time, the plot takes place in 1973, after scientists discover the appearance of an island in the South Pacific that wasn't noticed before. There are a ton of links to the first movie with the mention of the Monarch corporation, the mention of nuclear tests in the 50s being an attack on monster size creatures and the mention of the sight of these monsters by more than the military.On the island, we discover that MUTOs (another nod to Godzilla) surface due to the activities of human scientific discovery causing rumblings in the Earth. A theory that the Earth is not a solid mass of rock, leading to the core of the Earth is first mentioned. When the military and the scientists arrive, Kong is the first creature noticed, and as always, the military attacks causing Kong to defend himself and kill some of the military, crashing the helicopters, and separating the people into two groups, plus one solo individual.As in Godzilla, Kong is revealed as a creature that defends the human inhabitants of the island against the monsters that dwell there. We discover massive creatures such as an octopus, a spider, and the main enemy skull creatures that keep appearing after the military bombs the island, thus getting their attention.I have never in my life rooted for Samuel L. Jackson to be killed, but oh was that satisfying. He became obsessed with killing Kong due to the initial encounter being so lethal.There is a side story of an American soldier that crashed on the island during WW2 and survived there all those years. He is used as the info dump to explain what is going on, as the natives there don't seem to speak.At the beginning of the credits there is a very sweet montage of the soldier returning home to meet, what appears to be his son. Also, the Monarch corporation seems to strengthen now that word may get out about the monster appearances.Kong defending the weak, and Godzilla defending the weak, continue to be mysterious. Three more movies exist in this universe, though at the time of this writing one doesn't come out until March 2024.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Big Bash monsters - but it's different and works well,"Kong: Skull Island - More monster bashing - but a nice change in storyline.Okay another big monster bashing movie, yet this one feels different. The action as always is centre stage, and CGI of the big monsters has little ever been done better. The Kong CGI was exceptionally good, and you actually felt a lot of empathy towards the character which was incredible instead of seeing it alone as some big graphic.The film though is carried by our leads and the storyline. Tom Hiddleston & Samuel L Jackson are excellent as hero & villain respectively on the little island with big beasties. They are given a better story than usual with a change, and it worked very well. It kept me engrossed, and any rehash of the original King Kongs etc would simply have bored me despite the action on the screen.However, there is no getting away that we've all seen too many big monster bashes in recent years. The Mavel & DC films are full of them, and as two of our leads here come from the Marvel stable, it feels like you are revising their old world. One sequence even reminded me of 300 with the slow motion hacking/slashing action scenes. That aside the rest was fine, you got to admire that they allowed it to be an adult aimed film rather than having a Disney-fied movie.As a big budget monster movie, it was good, and deserves more credit than it seems to have got so far. It's a great stab and different to the rest. If you find it to watch, give it a go.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A pretty great adventure,"An all-star cast and imposing production design and visual effects make this one of the best King Kong films ever brought to the screen. Having seen previous films on the same subject, I can say without a doubt this one makes the material seem just as fresh and dynamic as its predecessors. Taking place during the waning days of the Vietnam War, it brings a gripping feel of nostalgia and also a wholesome sense of history even in a tumultuous uncertain time.Performances are solid all around, but Samuel L. Jackson and John C. Reilly are standouts, as two dueling perspectives- one of authority and one of peace. Without giving too much away, their backstories lend their points of view a sense of conviction. Highly recommended to fans of this genre and anyone who enjoys an uplifting blockbuster smash.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A remake just erases everything which sometimes is an insult to fans of the original. Unless, the remake stands on its own that it's entertaining for ""old"" fans, and ""new"" fans.The movie stands on its own and succeeds on various levels. First, the characters aren't as annoying as in the 2005 version. 2nd, it mixes character work and action, and doesn't offer to much of either. 3rd, the humor is not too much, and it's well timed. 4rd, it doesn't waste time with a (useless) build up, or side stories. It's a straight forward movie. And finally, more women will fall in love with Tom Hiddleston who is surprisingly well in action movies.Enjoy it!!!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Kong's Roar No Match for Roar of the Audience!,Totally agree with the (many) reviewers who called Kong: Skull Island a Humungous Turkey!

Best advice: have no expectations,"This movie was excellently shot, well acted, brilliantly directed, and surprisingly well executed. I walked into it thinking, ""Seriously?!"" I mean, come on, it's King Kong, the sequel. How good can it be? Well apparently, actually pretty f'ing enjoyable. I am not giving it high marks because it was an Oscar Winner by any stretch, except maybe on the graphics, but I mean, that can be said for most movies these days. No, I am giving it props because I actually enjoyed this movie and would highly recommend it. It grabs you from the beginning and keeps hold through out. No joke, incredibly shot. Incredible respect for the director, who has apparently not done anything to this scale before far as I can tell. And Tom Hiddleston, if you haven't seen Night Manager, it will change your mind about him as an actor. Yeah, I mean he's got Loki going on, but this and that short Hulu/BBC/AMC collabo truly shows his range beyond the megalomaniac Asgardian. Really, this movie reminds me of Pacific Rim: another movie I went in with NO expectations except monster film, so no dialogue, less plot, worse acting, and somehow less direction, and like that one, I was thoroughly delighted. Maybe low expectations are best in films like this, but that's OK. I am tired of the super hyped CGI fest that promises everything and delivers nothing. Sometimes, a pleasant surprise is just what the doctor ordered, and while some of plot may be predictable, that still does not take away from you caring about the characters and hoping that they manage to survive what should be a no-win scenario, and getting your kicks from a few well placed jump scares, tremendous photography, and, I feel, poignant commentary on the human condition. If you're not into monster films though, this may not be for you. But if you have an inkling for giant impossible beings kicking the crap out of each other and puny humans caught in the middle, you just may want to give this a chance....",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Worst King Kong movie ever,This is a movie where you almost want your money back afterwards. The only ones who saved the film from being a total waste of cash was the charming John C. Reilly with his glorious beard and the hundreds of computer effect guys who managed to make King Kong the only other alright character in the film. All the other characters were thin layered replaceable people who you never cared a single second for. I bet when the actors watched the film back for the first time they must have felt the same awkward embarrassment we felt watching the film. I don't know if it was on purpose but it felt a lot like a cheap B-movie from the 80's only with first class special effects.Please try not to support this lazy film making with your well earned money.,1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Return to Skull Island,"Like Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019), I waited a while to watch this. I actually enjoyed this the most of all the King Kong movies (if you don't count the original 1933 film). More of Skull Island during the Vietnam War era and some new creatures. Plus, more battles. Kong was the real show-stealer in this and I enjoyed him a lot.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This is a clash of a lot of titans.,"""I call them skull crawlers. Why? Cause it sounds unique.""Is there really nobody else wondering why the actresses in a King Kong movie are so attracted to this giant ape? Honestly, I'm always asking myself the same question. Is it because Kong ""King of all places he appears in"" is such an impressive appearance, radiating power and protection? Or is it its primitive nature? No idea! But that monkey has good taste in my opinion. In every movie he's looking full of desire at the lady in distress who crossed his path yet again. Now, these are always women who'll drive that primitive monkey bananas (how appropriate). Also in this new Kong movie, the lady who's being helped by the dreaded monkey, looks breathtaking and appetizing.""Kong: Skull Island"" contains a number of successful facets I was quite enthusiastic about. Personally I thought that the soundtrack was superb. The action scenes are really masterful at times. And Brie ""The Gambler"" Larson walking around the whole movie in an undershirt, was a brilliant idea. Onslow in ""Keeping up appearances"" also wears it all the time, but isn't really a treat for the eyes. But looking at Brie Larson wearing such a piece of nothing, makes you forget there's also a giant monkey on the island. The rest isn't so impressive though. The story is quite superficial and simple. It merely serves as a steppingstone for an actionable monster story full of breathtaking graphic violence. Some ridiculous situations are of a laughable level and some scenes look as if they were copied from ""Apocalypse now"" (A kind of homage apparently). Even on the helicopters you'll see an identical sound system that spews deafening music from the 1970's, as in the mentioned milestone.Who cares? I don't. There's only one thing I expect when watching a new King Kong movie. An impressive and frightening creature. Certainly the moment he produces that famous primal roar. And to be honest, this is the first time I was wondering if it wasn't a real primate. Because it looks so lifelike. If they had made an intellectually story full of meaningful dialogues and scientific gibberish, it probably wouldn't be good either. Just compare the last ""Godzilla"" movie and this one. How many percent of screen time did Kong have in this picture compared to that other monster? In my view, it's remarkably more. You don't have to wait long for his appearance. After the entertaining second world war scene, with two rivals ending up on this cursed island (apparently there was no apocalyptic storm there at that time), you'll soon see those penetrating eyes of the giant monkey.It's the sophisticated special effects that will cause you to quickly forget about the imperfections in the story. For example, the first confrontation between Kong and the impending battalion of combat helicopters was portrayed phenomenally. But on the other hand it was so obnoxiously stupid. They are witnessing how a giant monkey destroys one helicopter after the other. Smashing every single aircraft into millions of pieces. And yet, there's no pilot who concludes that it might be better to send his heli into another direction. Away from the furious monster. Too much psychedelic music and hallucinogens during their tour in Vietnam might have something to do with it. When Brie Larson wants to lift a crashed heli just by herself so she could free a giant water buffalo, like a real animal activist, I almost choked in my popcorn.You can call most of the human characters caricatural. But in a way, they fit perfectly in this movie. Especially Samuel L. Jackson who crosses the island looking for retaliation and who's determined to kill Kong. The psychotic tirades of him with hollow expressions such as ""This is one war, we're not gonna loose"", sometimes seem pretty lame. But actually I enjoyed these silly rants. The same goes for John Goodman's character. A so-called scientist who has set up this expedition for other reasons than he initially explained. And then there's the Robinson Crusoe on duty, John C. Reilly, who has been on this island for years now and sees a possibility to escape from this hellhole (most funny personage). Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson are actually the most normal characters. One of them rolling with his muscles as a professional tracker. The other displaying some other muscles as an anti-war photographer.The rest of the cast is not that important eventually. They only serve as props and are being used as bait to the colorful collection of giant monsters. So expect a series of flying, sliced and crushed victims. But despite the thin story and the fact that human fellow actors only serve as decorative pieces, this monster film is a true spectacle. As a monster movie lover, you must admit that the battle between Kong and the giant octopus is nevertheless outstanding and fantastic enough to give you the heebie-jeebies. The teaser in the end predicts a sequel (Well,money still makes the world go round). It isn't something I'm looking forward to. But the terrifying confrontation between those two opponents, Kong and Godzilla, could use a reboot. Apparently we have to wait for that until 2020. Bring it on, for all I care.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/2qtGQoc",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Does what it says on the tin.,"Set in the early 1970s, a team of scientists, backed up by armed forces, venture to a newly discovered island in the Pacific. All of them, bar one, think they're going for geological or scientific study but it's not long before they come face to face with the island's bigger inhabitants.'Kong : Skull Island' does what it says on the tin. It's about a huge monster, with other huge monsters, on a mysterious island containing spectacular and foreboding landscapes, and how human beings who we don't care about, get eaten, squashed, blown up and human beings we do care about manage to escape to tell the fantastical tale to an unsuspecting world.All of the above is what you go for and all of the above is what you get when you watch this. One criticism is that a little more character development would have been welcome. Some of the cast feel like they're giving lacklustre performances here. The only one who really grabs me is John C. Reilly, playing a Ben Gunn type character who has been marooned away from civilisation for many years. His craziness and openness makes him likable but Reilly also adds the right amount of pathos when his character reveals his thoughts about the wife he left behind and the son that he's never seen.The special effects are good and I did find myself rooting for Kong in some of the fight scenes, with a self satisfied, smug look on my face when he wins the day (that's not a spoiler because it's a given that Kong will survive and win, he's Kong). The fight scenes are good although I don't think they're quite as good as the ones in the most recent Godzilla.Overall, a decent effort but I expect better from the next Kong movie.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better than '05,"This movie had no shortage of familiar faces: Corey Hawkins and Jason Mitchell from Straight Outta Compton, Shea Wigham from Boardwalk Empire, Toby Kebbell from Black Mirror (excellent Netflix program), John C. Reilly from Talladega Nights and a host of other things, and John Goodman and Samuel L. Jackson who both need no introduction.The Kong story has been done time and again, most recently in 2005 with Jack Black. This version was a lot less drama and more action. They didn't dink around in this movie with delaying the unveiling of Kong, rather they gave us a glimpse early so as to not keep us in rapt anticipation like the '05 version. In that respect, they did well. But, the one consistent trope that is a constant bummer for me is the damsel in distress that Kong is enamored with. They downplayed that dynamic this time around so that the quasi-love affair/love triangle wasn't the story but it still had a part. I'm just not moved by the beast being tamed by the delicate white woman.""Kong: Skull Island"" offered a lot of ooh and aah moments, some obligatory humor and a strong anti-war message. I had no problems with any of it although they made Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson) so over the top with his dogged pursuit of military action as the answer that it detracted from the movie.I liked this version better than the '05 one and I can't remember the '76 version that well. With reference to Kong as a Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Object (M. U. T. O.) we can probably expect him to have an eventual showdown (or tag team effort) with Godzilla. That is a battle I'd pay to see.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"""Kong: Skull Island""-  A trashy B-movie with a $180 million budget and an A-list cast.  Whether that's for better or for worse is up to you to decide.","Since the critical and commercial success of 2014's American ""Godzilla"" reboot, there have been consistent murmurings of a ""MonsterVerse"" courtesy production company Legendary Entertainment. The goal? Bring together various properties based on massive city-stomping creatures and remake them for modern audiences. And here, just a few short years later, we have the long-awaited second chapter in this expanding franchise- 2017's hammy and quirky, but fairly entertaining ""Kong: Skull Island"", based of course on the classic character King Kong of cinematic royalty.Directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts, the film is very much a sort-of throwback feature, taking notes and inspiration from various trashy B monster-movies of the 60's, 70's and 80's and giving them a modern day spit-and-polish with top-notch CGI and A-list on-screen talent. The result is a troubled but fun little excursion into the unknown, with all the old tropes and clichés that we know and (maybe) love and plenty of contemporary action and effects. Really, the film is your basic creature feature and your enjoyment will be heavily reliant on your love for the old stereotypes contained within. If you can have fun with the material and look past its faults and occasional over- reliance on what's come before, you'll have a fun time. If not? Well, you best steer clear.We follow a motley crew of characters in the 1970's from all walks of life... researchers, soldiers, a magazine photographer and a no- holds-barred anti-hero animal tracker- as they travel to the mythical ""Skull Island"", seemingly on a mission map out the only recently discovered landmass before the Russians. However, upon arrival, things take an interesting turn when it is discovered that the island is home to not only a local tribe of natives, but massive creatures of all types- including a great ape known as ""Kong."" Teaming up with a marooned World War II veteran, the group is forced into a fight to escape... but at the same time, a nefarious and over-the-edge Colonel amongst their numbers has his sights set on Kong for his own dark reasons...To get it out of the way, the cast is great for the most part. There's a lot of really solid performers here. From the likes of cinematic icons such as Samuel L. Jackson and John Goodman to modern day superstars like Brie Larson and Tom Hiddleston... to comedy powerhouses like John C. Reilly, everyone is on point and giving it their all. While I do think some of the minor supporting characters and performances come up short (Jason Mitchell and Shea Whigham in particular both being shockingly flat in comparison to their other work as soldiers along for the mission), all the lead players do very good work here and are a joy to watch. Terry Notary and Toby Kebbell (who also plays one of the soldiers) provide the various motion capture techniques that bring Kong to life, and to be fair, Kong and their combined performances are quite stunning. While his screen time is limited, Kong feels like a real living, breathing being and you do get some real emotion from his character. While I could nit-pick and argue that I preferred the character as he was portrayed in the previous 2005 reboot... Kong is definitely in good hands in the MonsterVerse.And when the film reaches its stride, it's just consistently fun and completely engaging. Director Vogt-Roberts delivers some wonderful visual powerhouse sequences of Kong and the other monsters of Skull Island going at it, and a few genuinely eerie moments as the characters struggle to survive. A stand-out scene involving a 10-story spider was among my favorite moments, as was a chilling bone-year chase sequence as our heroes must evade enormous underground creeps known as ""Skull Crawlers."" It's when the action picks up that the film started to win me over big-time, and I'm thankful that this point is reached relatively early on.However, the film is not perfect by a long stretch, and looking over the other reviews, I can definitely see the problems. In striving to make such a fun throw-back feature, the creative minds behind ""Kong"" do shoot themselves in the foot more than once. We've seen this story before. We know these types of characters. And we've all witnessed these very same dialog exchanges and bar-room brawls and epic battles many times before. It can make the film a chore in its earlier scenes, and rob some of the suspense because we know what's coming much of the time. It can be fun in how archetypal it all is... but it can also be quite frustrating. In addition, the writing for the bulk of the supporting roles is pretty abysmal, with the many side-characters feeling vapid and interchangeable, which lessens the impact of the film. The intent is noble, but the execution leaves quite a bit to be desired at times.Still, I had a decent time. The effects are outstanding, the performers likable and the monster battles completely and utterly glorious in their scale. ""Kong: Skull Island"" isn't the best film starring the massive monkey (I know he's not really a monkey)... but it's serviceable enough and sets the stage for other monsters to join in on the fun. It's a fun time at the movies. Nothing more. Nothing less. And so, I give it an about-average 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"not sure what kind of blind people gave low score (under 7/10) to Kong: Skull Island, but they must've been the special kind of blind","Hey there. I decided to write this review, because of following. I really don't understand the people, who gave Kong: Skull Island low rating. It's like, You, yes, all of You <7/10, You're super weird. Here, allow me to point out why.1st. This movie was effing hilarious. It had everything You'd want from a commercial 80/90s styled movie blockbuster. It had perfect actors, excellent logic of people, funny homour, excellent camera, awesome sounds, very good script and many more.2nd. This movie is intented for King Kong, Godzilla, Lochness and other type of movies fans. Not for You casual viewers. It's a classic. And after some decade, they remade it, into a bliss.3rd. I don't like horrors and thrillers. It's easy, I don't watch them. You don't like the genre, don't watch it. It's not made for You. Simply leave the genre alone.4th. Such a spectacular camera, colors, effects (both CGi and non-CGi), narrative, everything, I wasn't able to see for a long time (I'm '84). This movie is a bliss for my soul and made me a great day. Entertained me, made me happy, made me satisfied. Well spent 2 hours.5th. If You don't like Kong movies, avoid this one. It's nothing for You.

Shame!,"This is a complete shame to the original Kong! Nothing wrong with the actors, they are good. The plot though is absolutely silly and bazaar.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Incredible visuals and creature design but poorly written.,"Kong: Skull Island is the second film in the ""MonsterVerse"" after Gareth Edward's 2014 film, Godzilla. It stars a lot of people, including, Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, John Goodman and John C. Reilly as a group of scientists and soldiers exploring a mysterious island. I've seen the main Kong films throughout the years and I have to say I do enjoy the concept of people finding an enormous gorilla on a primeval island; I always remember when I was younger being creeped out by Peter Jackson's 2005 King Kong and at one point was quite obsessed with it; since then I've enjoyed the 1933 original and even watched the not-so-good 1976 attempt. Now though we see a different take on the character, one set in the 70s, and of a larger world.I'll start with what I enjoyed, and first and foremost would be both the soundtrack and original score. Being set in the 70s, director Jordan Vogt-Roberts gives us some great pieces of music to accompany various scenes giving the film an upbeat, feel-good vibe, similar to that of Guardians of the Galaxy, or The Martian. And Henry Jackman delivers a well-composed dramatic score which includes some 70s vibes.Another thing to enjoy is that this film is full of really cool moments; scenes or shots that intend for you to be awed. Whether it be a silhouette of choppers flying towards Kong or just the animals and people of the island being framed through the Brie Larson character's 1970 era camera lens which makes for a really nice touch. Vogt- Roberts certainly has an eye for interesting and unique camera set ups and there were some great ones in here I really loved as well as some epic wide shots that you could just frame.Now unfortunately it's these amazing moments and ""awe shots"" that sort bring the movie down for me. While it's great to have those kind of scenes, you can't rely on them. Kong: Skull Island was visually stunning, almost to a surreal sense at times, adding to the island mystery, but as far as story and script goes, it was a bit underdeveloped. For the first two-thirds of the movie it felt like the story was just quickly written dialogue to get us from one cool shot to the next. The characters hardly had any development and surprisingly the most fleshed-out and interesting character was John C. Reilly's Hank Marlow. Although Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson are certainly great actors and look great, their characters were very one-dimensional. Hiddleston's was a generic former military hunter/tracker man with convenient skills and Larson's was a photographer, and that was pretty much it. Sam Jackson and John Goodman are also great actors and have delivered some incredibly iconic characters but here even they almost seemed expendable at points.So although the film is let down script-wise and is quite unevenly paced throughout most of it the final third is really good as it flows much better and the creature is design is amazing. Kong looks great, as well as some of the other fearsome creatures that inhabit the island but the stand-out for me were the disturbingly hideous Skull Crawlers whose mere existence you were thankful were only fictional.In the end Kong: Skull Island isn't quite what I expected it to be but it is a great-looking monster-movie and even has an after-credit scene for those who like to get excited for what's to come.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""You Guys Aren't Scientists""","After the complaints of Godzilla's presence being far too scarce in his own movie, you'd think Warner Bros and Legendary Entertainment would have resolved that by making King Kong the center of his own movie, right? Well, that's not entirely the case in Kong: Skull Island.Originally titled Skull Island, this film feels much more like an exploration into the island itself than it does a King Kong film. With a run-time of 118 minutes, Kong maybe makes up about 25 minutes of that. To be fair, after several repetitive King Kong films, the franchise could use a refreshing take. But if you're going to make a King Kong film, you expect to see the giant ape more than some random humans. So, that's the first major issue.The second, and perhaps far more important, is that the script is downright awful. Even worse, the tone is all over the place. I expected that this film was going to take itself as seriously as the 2014 Godzilla film did, especially after several trailers that were clearly trying to emulate Apocalypse Now. What we got is more along the lines of the humor from a Fast & Furious movie that tries to veer into the seriousness of a DCEU film. Except, the humor never hits. My theater was packed, and not a single joke granted a crowd- wide laugh.However, the film is beautifully shot by Larry Fong and the action is impossible to take your eyes away from. Kong has never looked better, and the final fight between him and other creatures is about as impressive of an action sequence as you'll see all year. But Is it really a shock that every second Kong is on-screen is great and every time they cut to a human that you don't care about, the film dull and boring? When you have the likes of Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L. Jackson, Brie Larson, John Goodman, Jason Mitchell, and Toby Kebbell there should be at least one character worth rooting for, right?Well, as it turns out, John C. Reilly's 'Hank Marlow' is the only redeemable character worth mentioning. Hiddleston is useless, Jackson is way too over-the-top, Kebbell & Mitchell are annoying, and Larson is merely passable. I like all of these actors, but they got stuck with sloppily written characters that are far from fleshed out. Perhaps cutting out 5 or 6 of the leads and giving that screen time to either Kong, or to add depth to the more significant roles.I'm still invested in this ""monster-verse"" because I, like everyone else in the world, can't wait to see Kong & Godzilla duke it out for the ""King"" title in a few years. But pushing aside the main attraction for some good looking actors isn't what I want from a monster film. The thrills are a little too few and far in between. So for me, Kong: Skull Island is a big letdown.+Gorgeous to look at+Kong impresses-When he's on screen-Waste of an extremely talented cast-Awful script5.7/10",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Newly update rendition of King Kong is no game-changer. Nonetheless, it is a satisfying experience","As an average monster B-movie, Kong: Skull Island does about everything it sets out to do. It is fast-paced, it is thrilling, and it is pure eye candy in terms of special effects. But when it comes to leveling up with previous iterations like the Peter Jackson installment back in 2005, it is perhaps less than successful as was Gareth Edward's 'Godzilla' in reaching the heights of the original Godzilla. Jordan Vogt-Roberts takes the director's chair to deliver an extravagant re-imagination of the giant gorilla. Blending in eye-popping special effects, visual spectacle, and sleek anti-war commentary, Roberts places the story of the giant gorilla in 70s Vietnam War period with visual heft that pays clear nods to Francis Ford Coppola's 'Apocalypse Now' while attempting to retain the spirit of the popular Hollywood ape. Set in 1973, this film follows Bill Randa (played by John Goodman), a senior government official who leads a group of soldiers including British Air Service Captain James Conrad (played by Tom Hiddleston), U.S Army Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard (played by Samuel L. Jackson), and U.S Army Major Jack Chapman (played by Toby Kebbell) along with a team of young soldiers and photojournalist Mason Weaver (played by Brie Larson) to an uncharted Pacific island where they encounter vicious creatures. Of course, the biggest threat of the island happens to be giant gorilla the size of a skyscraper who unleashes hell upon their arrival. With the help of World War II veteran Hank Marlow (played by John C. Reilly) who's been stranded on the island for nearly three decades, it is up to the big group to escape the island while surviving against the violent Gorilla and monstrous creature onslaught.There is definitely nothing special or subversive about Jordan Vogt-Roberts, and the quality of his direction is predictably undermined by the previous iterations of titular gorilla. Roberts's execution for the popular source material is bit more blockbuster-ized than what Hollywood has spawned in the past. When it comes to delivering the thrills however, gets the job done. The plot quickly kicks into gear during the first half-hour when the ensemble cast of characters arrive on the island in helicopters, and the thirty-story gorilla appears out of nowhere swatting the helicopters from the air, blowing them in smithereens. The tension only heats up when the cast is forced to face down a wide variety of freaky creatures including carnivorous pterodactyls and boney dinosaur-like creatures that eat humans for breakfast. And this is all complete with slick CGI and a wide plethora of explosions to feast the eyes. There is definitely a Jurassic Park vibe to handed here. Characters are attacked, some of them are eaten, and the there is a grueling creature-on-creature battle that erupts during the final stretch. Underneath it all is a hodgepodge of anti-war commentary and morality issues toward the end that play roles in the story, and Roberts does not hesitate to spew a few homages of old Vietnam War flicks from the 80s era. It is easy to interpret to story as a B-monster movie decorated as a war flick. In terms of characterizations, the majority of the characters who sadly depth, with only Samuel L. Jackson's Preston Packard and John C. Reilly's Hank Marlow only being well developed. And it is the latter that serves as the show-stealer of the pack. Sprouting with charisma and kind-hearted humor, Reilly gives arguably the biggest appeal. The rest of the cast give some alright performances, but it does little to redeem for the shallow development.Kong: Skull Island is an exhilarating monster flick blooming with thrills, shiny special effects, and a direction that fairly pays off. This rendition of the popular primate is far from a game-changer nor does it try to be one. To say the least, it is a fun pre-Summer flick. If you are craving to see a giant gorilla the size of a skyscraper wrecking havoc and smashing creatures to oblivion, this one will make that investment.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Kong: Skull Island ShowMeTheMovies Review,"Better than expected, a not-too-shabby attempt at yet another (insert eye-roll here) King Kong picture, starring Tom Hiddleston, John C. Reilly and the beloved Samuel L. Jackson.Predominantly set in 1973, the flick follows a purpose-built team of soldiers, scientists and stragglers as they head for the undiscovered Skull Island in search of the unknown. Here they stumble upon a beast trapped on the island known as Kong - a potentially misjudged anti-hero.Highly-anticipated by many, this sequel was - in my mind - always going to be either a complete masterpiece or bucketful of disappointment. To my surprise(/delight/sadness), it turned out to be neither. Whilst on the most part I would praise its' solid cinematography (some beautiful landscape and action shots), as well as Kongs' expert-use of CGI throughout, these couldn't save it from what appeared to me a watered-down premise with fortune-cookie-clichés being pulled out of a hat and inserted into every appropriate crevice.The acting standard as a whole is admittedly not bad - I have to give particular nod to Samuel L Jackson for finally producing a well played-out character (seriously, name me a role he's played well since Django Unchained and I'll be a monkey's uncle) - but I can't particularly criticise much of the performances throughout. Toby Kebbell (yes, that guy that's been in everything recently that you never remember the name of) and Brie Larson were probably the most bland - with Tom Hiddleston outshining most of his fellow cast members.The fight scenes were indeed the most entertaining part - well-timed, well thought-out and, at times, epic! Other than a slight overuse of slow-motion features, and a couple of ridiculous shots, I honestly quite enjoyed seeing not only the fights with Kong himself but the other internal exchanges (no spoilers, I promised!).Also, entirely blameless of the creators, but yet another movie this season with the insertion of JFK, Vietnam and 60's culture was really not needed (sorry guys!). Despite this, it redeemed itself slightly with some fairly enjoyable music throwbacks. Alongside these were plenty of well-utilised sound-effects and editing that I found rather enjoyable (a complete renunciation from the script).I was pleasantly surprised to find Kong: Skull Island didn't leave me wanting 2 hours of my life back; that said, given the choice I wouldn't waste another two rewatching it. Okay to pass the time, Kong exists. If you're after something more worthwhile, perhaps skip this and shove on Predator (terribly brilliant) or Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus (brilliantly terrible).showme-themovies.blogspot.co.uk/2017/03/review-kong-skull-island.html",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Spoiler free Review,"After the disappointing Godzilla of 2014, I was really hoping that this movie would set this little Monster verse back on track.This movie Took everything that defines a great monster movie and did the complete opposite, it was more of a CGI vomited action flick, at no point was the movie thrilling or even scary like you should expect from a monster movie. It brought together a very impressive cast and did NOTHING with them, the only ounce of character development came from John C. Reilly's character, even know he did didn't really fit into the film. It had one of the most disgraceful screenplays I've ever seen, and that's not an over exaggeration I have seen fast and the furious movies with better writing then that, it had a great soundtrack but unfortunately fell under the same trap that most movies do and used the songs only to advance the movie forward.And finally the King. Peter Jackson's 2005 reboot was one of my favorite movies growing up, and I did not think it was possible for me to ever hate king kong, unfortunately this movie did such a bad job with not only displaying Kong but with keeping him a lovable yet terrifying monster.So anyone planning to see this movie, you've been warned, also for everyone who is giving this movie a good review you need to watch some proper movies.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Goofy,"Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson make for unlikely action movie stars in this goofy mashup of ""King Kong"" and ""Jurassic Park.""Samuel L.

Reilly, who pops up mid-way through the movie as a crazy island recluse, who steals the show.Or should I say it's the Oscar nominated visual effects that steal the show. Kong is an impressive CGI creation, as are the mean chicken lizards he's constantly fighting.A post-credits sequence hints at a sequel.

Missed the real king kong feeling BUT entertaining enough,As a huge king kong fan and having grown up in the 70s with the 1976 kong version and having owned all kong related films I have to say I was disappointed from the beginning of this film as it missed the real kong feeling showing how the swat team went to the island with the rest of the team but in a humorous way like we were watching a....comesy-adventure parody film. there was no mystery and in a few minutes king kong suddenly appeared on screen fighting with the choppers like it was....the end of the film.the surprise factor was gone. the kong atmosphere was ruined.Afterwards things improved we got a good story new monsters and there was a tribute to the 1976 film showing the big wall which kept apart the human natives from the monsters....etc.the monsters were great the effects also good and the film was entertaining enough but as I said for me the first 30 minutes or so ruined the real kong feeling the movie should have.,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"An Entertaining, Fun Popcorn Movie","Lighten up guys! Of course this movie isn't a serious drama and has some flaws, but I found it fun and entertaining nonetheless. It's not as bad as it is made out to be. Sure like all movies of this genre you have to turn off your brain and suspend all disbelief, but isn't that why we go to the movies in the first place? To escape reality? Like I said, I found this movie fun, entertaining, and a fast-paced ride. The cast was good and played their roles adequately. I also enjoyed some of the humor to the movie as well. Though, I have to admit I would like to see more of Tom Hiddleston's and Brie Larson's characters. Hopefully they are in a sequel. I thought the film made Kong out to be more of a protective guardian type which was alright with me. I liked to see a few more of the secondary character live. But, all in all, I enjoyed it. I guess if I had a complaint it would have been the lack of other prehistoric monsters in it. But, otherwise this is pure mindless, entertaining fun and should be viewed as such. Is it perfect no, but it is entertaining. The last time I listened to a critic about a movie I was bored out of my mind. So, if you want serious, critically acclaimed drama, this is not for you. But if you just want pure, dumb fun and action, this will fit the bill nicely.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Kong is back!!!!,"There are very few things that I respect more than a movie that is unafraid to embrace its own stupidity. Kong: Skull Island has thinly written characters, extreme tonal dissonance, bad dialogue, and a complete and utter disregard for the talents of Oscar-winning actress Brie Larson, but it's absolutely glorious in its brazen spectacle. Its thin characters and tonal dissonance don't matter as much because it thoroughly commits to its premise, and it seems like the movie is one ridiculous–but hilarious–visual gag after another. The bad dialogue is all part of the fun. It's not trying to be something it's not, and that's something I appreciate in any movie, especially a nostalgia-laced B-movie blockbuster about a giant ape.Some might draw connections to the time era explored or the interplay between man and nature, but the movie succeeds at its main goal: entertain the hell out of the audience. Actors like Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson are (pretty) pieces of cardboard in this, but seasoned vets like Samuel L. Jackson and John C. Reilly thoroughly understand what it is they're being asked to do. They both ham it up big time, with Vogt-Roberts's visual flourishes adding to their performances in beautiful ways throughout. They both give pitch perfect performances that are 100% appropriate for their roles, and Reilly in particular becomes the heart and soul of the story. As an actor, the best response to a movie like this is to embrace the ridiculous, and Jackson and Reilly certainly do.However, the ridiculous can sometimes move aside to reveal a visually stunning movie with a large heart. The production design is gorgeous, and the classic shot–a character whose back is turned to us, staring up in awe and fear at Kong–is breathtaking. The movie itself has that type of reaction to its own character, to its own force of nature, looking up in wonder and childish glee as Kong destroys another piece of its surroundings. This is big, bold, and confident filmmaking, precisely because the movie understands what it's not.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Marlon Brando really let himself go,"This movie destroys most of all the things I never understood about the old king kong movies. First, this movie's violence is extremely well used, placed, and made. The CGI in this movie was some of the best I have literally ever seen. Coming from the guy who thought Tarkin in Rogue One was amazing. The next best thing in this movie is the acting, and before you think this guy has some low standards listen. This movie is not supposed to be an ""acting movie."" the characters are there to have five or six to like and one or two to love. and this casting assemble killed this and understood that. This is a person who loves retro, throwbacks, and all styles paradise. REASONS I LOVED IT!! ONE - They toned down the love affair between the lead female charter and kong. TWO - The two leads that so happen to be opposite genders don't have to fall in love. THREE - Kong, for the most part, is saving HIS ISLAND more than the humans. FOUR - The movie realizes that it's not a FREAKING REALISTIC MOVIE!! You can have things like a man using a samurai sword and unconventional uses of violence to make it BADASS (ONE OF THE MAIN REASON Tarantino IS LOVED SO MUCH!!!) FIVE - it's downright hilarious in so many scenes. If you hate movies designed for just making money and love to see an original action-packed film this comes both in such an amazing way.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A much different take on the King Kong franchise,"After the Vietnam war, a team of scientists and military men investigate an uncharted island full of ferocious monsters including an ape named Kong.This movie acts as a new installment to the King Kong franchise, an a much different take at that. Personally, I'm one of those people who wasn't extremely fond of the 2005 King Kong remake and because of that, I was anticipating this movie. Unfortunately, it ended up being a mixed bag.To start with the bads, I found some of the green-screening way too obvious. This trend can first be seen during the beginning of the movie as some of the backgrounds don't match up with ones from the last or next shots, as an example. Another issue I had was with the ending. Without spoiling anything, I have to say that the ending of the movie feels unfinished; it left me confused and had me asking myself: ""Wait, that's it?"" However, my main issue with the movie is that despite the fact that the movie's title has the name Kong in it, we barely see him outside of the beginning and ending, and that's pretty disappointing for me. As someone who wanted to see more of King Kong throughout the film, it kind of is a letdown to see that he only has very few appearances. My final complaint has to be that the movie feels too different from its previous installments. When you go into a remake or reboot of an older movie, you'd expect them to at least somewhat follow the formula of the original work. That's not the case here, as it seems like the film is trying to be its own thing. Granted, they do pay homages to the original movie, but it doesn't save this from being one of the movie's weaknesses.Now let's take a look at the goods. To start, the environments were beautiful. The movie gives us a breathtaking look at an uncharted island and it makes you want to see it for yourself. Another strength of the movie has to be the action scenes. The action scenes just looked plain awesome and they were the highlight of the film. The action scenes had a lot of engaging and gripping moments that left me on the edge of my seat. I don't want to spoil the movie, so if you'd like to watch the action scenes in this, then you should go see it for yourselves. The last strength of the movie is that it feels different; it's both the film's strength and weakness. The only real positive I can say about the movie being different is that it does a great job at being its own thing.Overall, I find the movie to be a mixed bag. I like the action scenes, environment and the fact that it's trying to do something different with the franchise; although that is a weakness as well as the fact that we don't see the star very often.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Very Entertaining, great CGI but nothing out of the ordinary","OK I would go straight to the point here, Kong was action filled coupled with very good acting as I did expect, however the story-line & dialogue at some point could be likened to that of a 12-year old, very weak & lacks purpose. Without the fighting / action scenes I probably would have rated the movie 4/10 as the other scenes were very boring. At some stage, I couldn't understand what the mission was because it got very confusing and plain. Looking at the positives though, CGI was totally top notch, Kong was scary, powerful and his engagements with other creatures were very interesting. Acting was also OK, Tom Hiddleston & Samuel L Jackson delivered, the other actors weren't bad either. To round it all up, the movie is still a very good watch if you not expecting so much but for decent action scenes and good brawls.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
creature feature,"Greetings again from the darkness. I enjoy creature movies. Even as a kid I enjoyed creature movies (as distinguished from monster movies, which I'm also fond of). From the classics to the (very) low budget ones on late night TV to the fear-mongering from Japan  I enjoy them all. Of course the most fascinating of the bunch is King Kong, and this version arrives 84 years after the still magnificent 1933 version from Merian C Cooper and featuring Fay Wray.This time there is no shootout on The Empire State Building, and the connection between Kong and the girl is limited to a few knowing glances. Most of the film takes place on Kong's island  one he shares with some other creatures (not rodents) of unusual size. Unlike Spielberg in Jaws, who teased us for half the movie before finally revealing the shark, we get a glimpse of the imposing Kong very early on.The cast is the best yet for a creature feature. John Goodman and Corey Hawkins play scientists/conspiracy theorists; Tom Hiddleston plays the world's only mercenary with perfect hair and skin; Brie Larson is a self-described anti-war photographer; while Samuel L Jackson, Shea Whigham, Thomas Mann and Toby Kebbell play military men on their last mission at the end of the Vietnam War. The most colorful character is played by John C Riley – an eccentric WWII survivor who has been living on the island since 1944.Jordan Vogt-Roberts directs this version, and his resume of The Kings of Summer and mostly TV work begs the question of how the heck did he get this gig? Fortunately he has cinematographer Larry Fong alongside, and his significant big action picture experience is obvious in the breath-taking helicopter scene (as well as many others). It's impossible not to notice the extreme love shown to Apocalypse Now and even Jurassic Park. Some of the shots and tone seem as if pulled directly from those films  even moreso than the original King Kong. We even get Samuel L Jackson recycling his ""hold onto your butts"" line.There is plenty here to satisfy us lovers of creature features, though this version certainly lacks the emotional impact of Fay Wray and Naomi Watts connecting with Kong ... not much Beauty, but plenty of Beast. It's certainly recommended that you stay for the post-credits scene that sets the stage for 2020.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Jurassic Park #3?,"Kong: Skull Island -◘With abysmal amount of visual effects and CGI, Kong delivered an A-One cinematic experience.

The Skull Island expedition crew included a group of militants lead by Preston Packard(Samuel L Jackson), some geologists who look nothing like geologists, the 'experienced' James Conrad(Tom Hiddleston) recruited by Bill Randa (John Goodman) and a beautiful anti-war photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson). They all shared a common trait - idiocy !◘Half of their team bit the dust combating Kong, a quarter of the rest were eaten by ""Skull crawlers' (it's a really cool name) and still Sam Jackson wants to hunt the mighty King. In short the cast reflected a bunch of morons mimicking each other at the time of a Jurassic Park situation. BTW, this felt like a Jurassic Park 3 rip off!◘3D was spectacular. Monsters had a decent amount of screen time (unlike Godzilla). The sound effects were good.. So, where technicality prevailed, cliché deep rooted and story sucked. Still a guaranteed entertainment and a fast paced movie is assured. I rate [3/5].",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Reboot of One of the Most Iconic Monster of All Time,"Finally! A worthy reboot (remake) of the very famous monster! I was very very entertained with this movie. It was full of surprising scenes and many crazy fight scenes between Kong and the soldiers, plus Kong and other monsters. The special effects of this movie were absolutely wonderful. Kong was created using motion capture techniques and the rest of the monsters were very lifelike (and scary). The sound effects were very good. There were so many moments where we would be surprised by the sudden movement (with those shocking sounds) during the movie.What I loved about the movie was also the essence of King Kong story line like in previous movies were also captured, such as Kong's fight with major monsters, the intention of people to conquer him and even his fascination to the female character. And the time of the story which was in the 1970s also added a nice oldies feel to the movie. My wife also highlighted that she felt the movie was having a real 1970s sense which I think was due to the good make up (1970s hair style, suits) and equipments like the old choppers or Walkie Talkie you would usually see in movies with Vietnam wars.Another thing that I loved about this movie was that the introductions of the characters did not take too long and it was moving in quite fast pace to the main story in the island. The film was almost perfect in providing nonstop entertainment and my wife and I also really enjoyed the full movie. At the top I have mentioned that the movie is a worthy reboot since I believe this movie excel in comparison to the 2005 version. Despite that movie's quite loyal to the earlier 1930s and 1970s versions, I felt that the 2005 movie was not giving the wow factor and scary feeling of what King Kong was supposed to make to audience.Anyway, in conclusion to this movie, I definitely say it is one of the coolest action monster movie. There was not a lot of drama in it, just pure adrenaline pumping action film. The movie also had some brief funny moments and touching moment before the end. Oh before I forgot, this movie has got a post credit scene. So better watch out for it coz the scene would provide you some very interesting insight and exciting future films.So for those of you who had not seen the movie yet, please make sure you watch it as I am sure you would be very entertained with this film. Those who prefer to watch drama or romance or Oscar winning movie, then I would recommend to see it without over thinking and just enjoy the movie.For my complete review: Pls see michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This Movie is Okay,"I encourage you to see this film and it's worth seeing on the big screen. However, if it's a coin toss between this and something you're certain to like, see the other movie.The acting is good, the cinematography is good, the script is good, there's smashing and 'splosions and a little too much silliness for me.

"A dry, faceless, blockbuster with some good things.","After enjoying the Gareth Edwards oddly significant Godzilla, I actually looked forward to Jordan Vogt-Roberts Kong Skull Island. Godzilla left me with an impression that the producers of the ""monster- verse"" movies had restraint from these films becoming ""Transformers"" levels of stupid. But after Kong, I still have that mindset, just lowered a bit. Kong is not overly dumb, it's just too dry to become anything other than the stereotype blockbuster.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's monstrous and entertaining... IMAX takes it to another level,"I watched Kong in IMAX for the first time & I have become fan of it. This movie is best in most categories. Pure entertainment.You get action just when you needed. All the actors have surprisingly got most of screen share.Script is good, CGI is amazing. Animals and nature looks breathtaking.It's far better than Godzilla, where the animals were just roaring nothing else. Here they have lot's of things in the script. There's story going on. Just wonderful.A must watch film in theaters only, I won't see the impact would be that much in TV screens.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Stylish, fun, trashy, and immensely entertaining,","It's official, we finally have a franchise centered entirely around giant monsters. The films in this monster verse include 'Godzilla', 'Pacific Rim', and now 'Kong'. I gotta say, going into this film I expected the worst. I expected it to be the typical Marvel-esque film where it tries a little bit too hard to make you like its characters and ends in an unnecessarily over the top action sequence between an underdeveloped villain. But I'm happy to report that this film is not like that, at all. What is interesting about these three monster movies is that they all feel incredibly unique to the filmmakers. They all have a distinct voice and style that no other ""franchise"" has. They are very much the director's film. Not the studios.This is one of the weirdest, most horrifically violent PG-13 studio films I have seen in quite some time. It actually remained me a great deal of 'The Great Wall'. Except this film seems to have a slight sense of self-awareness. This actually shocked me. It almost makes fun of itself and the films that are like it. It has the typical character sacrifice scene near the end except he just gets whipped a mile away from the action and just dies. It's not heroic, he just dies for basically no reason. It's scenes like this that really make this film work. Characters say goofy lines right before getting smashed to pieces, there's tons of color, and the camera is constantly on the move.In many ways, it feels like a Micheal Bay movie that is actually aware of itself. It knows how dumb it is and it plays it up to ludicrous degrees. I mean, a guy literally gets impaled by a giant ant for crying out loud. If you're taking this film seriously, you're doing it wrong. If you think this is just a typical action movie and aren't open to what is about to happen you'll probably hate this film.Because it is that typical action movie we all expected. The characters are flat as boards and they don't really do much aside from being smashed to death. Not to mention it features a giant monster that punches other giant monsters in their stupid faces. So, if you aren't ready to accept the fact that this film is almost making fun of itself then you probably shouldn't see this.However, if you want to see gigantic action set pieces and corny dialogue ripped straight out of the 1980's then boy do I have a movie for you. This is the first massive scale action movie in a long time that is just an action movie. It knows exactly what it is and it doesn't screw around with hardly anything else. It doesn't really bother setting up characters or anything like that. It shows us where all these people are in their lives and then it just goes.Within twenty minutes King Kong is tearing apart helicopters and crushing people to death. And from then on, the film does not stop moving. It's actually so frantically paced that you really don't have time to think about the paper thin characters or lack of story. It just goes from one action sequence to the next in such haste that nothing else really matters. That being said I do have one major flaw that almost ruins the entire film.The editing here is an absolute travesty. This film is so poorly edited that it's borderline incoherent. There are scenes that abruptly end and transition into a completely different area featuring the same characters. They will be in one place and without warning the film will cut to an entirely different location at an entirely different time of day but it stays with the same characters the whole time. The editing is so aggressive and rushed that even some of the action scenes move too quickly to get a sense for what is happening.But, aside from that, this film is thoroughly enjoyable. There a few parts that drag just a bit and that editing is in complete disarray, but I loved this film. It's such a breath of fresh air in a genre over saturated by people wearing capes that we vaguely care about. What 'Kong' does better than so many of these other action movies is that it just is a movie. It doesn't blatantly attempt to set up a sequel or take itself more seriously than it needed too. It knows that it's dumb and it plays on that. It's goofy, overblown, and often times downright weird, yet that's why I love it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"The Monsters, The Cast, The 70s References - Love It","King Kong is back in....1973.I am a middle aged guy who often goes for the retro or retro-style of Hollywood epics. When ""Skull Island"" was first advertised I just refused to see it in theatres,

"It may not be as iconic as the 1933 classic, Kong Skull Island is a fun monster movie that has a roar","It's safe to say that out of the many iconic moments in cinema (Dorothy discovering herself in a world of Technicolor in Wizard of Oz, Charles Foster Kane saying ""Rosebud"" before his death in Citizen Kane and the entire finale of It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World), many people can recall the image of a giant gorilla attacking planes off of the Empire State Building in King Kong. Though it may sound like something out of a B movie, people tend to forget that King Kong was once the true king of the world with some of the most impressive special effects of the time. I highly recommend the documentaries about the making of the 1933 film.Aside from a couple of sequels and remakes in 1976 and 2005, there hasn't been more exploration of the world Kong lives in. Sure, we know he's a large ape, but the island that he called home had dinosaurs, giant spiders, and various monsters. That itself is a goldmine for more fantasy-like exploration. With the popularity of the American remake of Godzilla, it made sense that Warner Brothers would want to revive the eighth wonder of the world. The world is given more exploration in Kong: Skull Island.In 1973, government scientist William Randa (played by John Goodman) gets approval to lead an expedition to an uncharted island that had been blocked by bad weather. He hires a military group in Saigon called the Sky Devils, a former Vietnam helicopter squadron led by Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard (played by Samuel L. Jackson) for escort. He also hires a former British Special Air Service Captain James Conrad (played by Tom Hiddleston) and photojournalist Mason Weaver (played by Brie Larson). All together in a helicopter convey, they make it through the island, but are quickly brought down by a gorilla standing over a hundred feet.The survivors are split into two group with both planning on heading north to the rendezvous point where there only hope for rescue is in three days. While Randa, Packard, and some of the solders start searching for fellow crew, Conrad, Weaver and the rest of the survivors are found by a tribe of Iwi natives, but are assured by a WWII pilot whose been stuck there for thirty years Hank Marlow (played by John C. Reilly) that they are friendly. It's discovered that Kong is worshiped as a god to protect them from the larger lizard creatures on the island. Along with those, giant spiders, and King Kong himself, its race against time to see who can make it.For a spin off about King Kong, my expectations were low. The good news is that Kong: Skull Island happens to be good monster movie. Good, but not great. Half of that has to do with the casting. While John Goodman and Samuel L. Jackson have a lot of good scenes (including a subtle Jurassic Park reference), neither Tom Hiddleston nor Brie Larson are that interesting. Both actors are trying, but the script simply makes their characters empty shells of leading men and women. But lets face it, the real star of the movie happens to be Kong. Unlike Godzilla, which took a lot of time away from the monster, here we get more of the giant ape and him fighting the various creatures of Skull Island. I love his design and of how more animalistic his personality is, even more so then the 2005 remake.Though the characters aren't strong, what makes up for it is the atmosphere and tome. It's clear that a lot of influence was taken from Apocalypse Now, Jurassic Park and of course King Kong. It all meshes into a beautiful looking picture that fits right alongside the multiple Vietnam war movies. I'm not sure who was responsible for the cinematography, but they deserve a lot of accolades.I'll give this seven Kongs out of ten. While I can't see thing alongside the original King Kong in a state of icon-like phrase, it's a fun popcorn monster movie. It gives you what you want fast and manages to keep the tone going. I have to give this a lot of credit for running under two hours. With a lot of blockbusters going well over that, it's nice to see a movie that knows how long it needs to be. As long as you can accept this a blockbuster, then I'm sure you'll have some fun. Get to the theaters and see if this roars some excitement into you.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Jurassic Kong World,"A fun but forgettable film.This is the kind of movie that is made to be seen on the big screen. Basically because it makes Kong feel like a towering monster!But it has its issues. The movie lacks a good dialog. It could have used some catch-phrases to give it some appeal. And although the character development wasn't bad, it needed an identifiable main character.The film, at times, also insults our intelligence. Basically, if a pilot sees a helicopter get swatted down by a huge monster, perhaps the other pilots would change course or retreat! Or at least be smart enough not to fly their choppers within arms' length of an unknown monster!That being said... The concept was good and intriguing. The visual setting was a feast for the eyes. I felt the real physical landscapes blended with the CGI sets very well. This was done better than a lot of recently released action movies.'Kong: Skull Island' isn't going to win any major awards. But it is fun to watch!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What did people expect?,"Just got back from seeing this at the cinema, to be fair its only a 6 or 7 out of 10 movie, I only gave it 10 to balance out some of the idiotic reviews on here, 1 out of 10? No way, somebody said they even walked out after an hour, why? It was a King Kong monster movie, made specifically to tie him in to the Godzilla franchise, I don't know what some people were expecting to see. I wasn't expecting a script on a par with The Godfather or acting that wouldn't be out of place in a serious Oscar contender, I was expecting Kong and some other big monsters to fight it out in a totally unrealistic way while an annoying human subplot got in the way for the best part of 2 hours, as is standard practice in good old monsters movies going back to the original Kong via many a Godzilla flick and all the many rip offs in between.Bottom line is is it as good as the original 1933 film? No, it isn't. Is it as good as the 1970s remake? Yes, it's probably a bit better. Is it as good as Peter Jacksons version? Seeing as how it isn't 3 hours long and as boring as watching paint dry I'd say its a good deal better. Bring on the next Godzilla film so we can get more of the original Toho monsters in on the action before the big two square off!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A bigger monster to get away from the old cliché,"A new remake for a classic, now getting away from the old but adorable cliché of always, Kong takes a different approach from its predecessors, but that does not mean that it is better. We have a script that innovates within the franchise, because even without the ""King"" in the name, Kong is king of an island and fight against Cajus - no dinosaurs this time - the script innovates and at the same time we all know their endings, The film tells the story of researcher Bill Randa (John Goodman), who in 1973 departed to explore an island that until then is isolated and unknown to the rest of the world. We have a very digital photograph, the chroma key jumps, and Kong's scanning is not very perfectionistic, sometimes even to notice its pixelization, and we also have the old focus on the sun of the apocalypse now - After all, we have references to war Of Vietnam - references that are wide open in their soundtrack, with a good rock of the 70s, its assembly is good, its rhythm does not get to mesmerize but it pleases, and its direction of art desires, its camera angles are great , Focus on the eyes creating a Mexican stalemate between Kong and his ""Enemies"", to the best style - Guarding the due proportions - Sergio Leone. We have one of the best blockbuster films I've seen that goes from John Goofman to Brie Larson, to Samuel L. Jackson and Tom Hiddleston, but incredible as it may seem, this cast is completely expendable, John Reilly even does A good performance, and Samuel Jackson is the least worst as ever, Oscar winner Brie Larson seems to have no desire at all, but let's give a discount, fianl this movie is from Kong, the gorilla now bigger than normal goes well, Despite the regular quality of its effects, it punches, kicks, picks up trunk, judo punches and detonates Cajus, that is, plays its role. ""Kong"" is a film for the nostalgic of monsters or for those who want to enjoy a Sunday afternoon with the family, because it is fun and good to watch and not even that bad.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Kong is not King anymore.,"Whether the world was in a desperate need for another King Kong or not seems immaterial after watching this. The underlying and rather obvious justification is to make way for a future crossover with another tired franchise (hello Godzilla) as money-making scheme - the same way Marvel has been doing for the past decade, revisiting, rebooting and ultimately exhausting Spider Man's and Hulk's properties.On paper I blamed this reboot, seeing as Peter Jackson's 2005 passion project was both overlong and over-the-top but fun and engaging in equal measure. He provided an ambitious scope, not only on a technical level, to an iconic property rendering a product that is proud and respectful of its legacy but also autonomous on its own.This 2017's outing however lacks both the same comprehensive talent and commitment and, just 12 years after that last successful adaptation, feels rather soon and unnecessary. For entertainment purposes though, all this reasoning and opposition could be waived if done right - and for a moment, as the first promotional materials started emerging (specially an astounding first trailer), it seem like it was. Nevertheless, Kong: Skull Island is guilty of not only proving those initial fears right, as it is of being utterly pedestrian and cheesy to an annoying degree.The story (save for the time setting), the functional autopilot characters and the motivations are the same and nothing shows a glimmer of originality or audacity. Don't get me wrong, that is not necessarily a bad thing - some summer blockbusters and recent entertainment tent poles have had the same approach with very enjoying results (Prometheus did that for me, for instance).I found myself continuously trying to find a saving grace for Kong: Skull Island, because the seamlessly magnificent cinematography and direction (of the action scenes particularly) kept me interested, kept me awed, kept me rooting - all to the point where the film had spiraled out of control into pure formulaic tawdry formula beyond redemption. The film knows it is cheesy and Vogt knows that's its selling point and that's what we came for but the forceful toleration of suspension of disbelief and exaggeration beyond reason implies we have ever cared for any of the human characters or for the central Kong, a misunderstood hero and protector. But no, we have never cared.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

One of the worst Films.,"I've never written a review but I will for this one. The editing is too quick, each shot lasting 2 seconds and switching to a completely different scene. There was too many narratives happening at once, too many characters to focus on at once, the writing was very predictable and there were far too many unnecessary cliché lines. However, the biggest downfall of this film was Samuel Jackson overacting, don't get me wrong, he's a good actor but he never should of been in this film. The combination of the directors choices and his character just didn't work. The only good bits of this film was the beautiful scenes between Kong, Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson.

Not a bad King Kong movie.,"Kong: Skull Island takes you to the exotic and mysterious feel of the jungle, where a group of soldiers and scientists explore an island off the Pacific and runs into the gigantic gorilla, Kong. The scientists want the behemoth for studying, the soldiers want to eliminate it and the others just want to leave it alone and escape the island.This movie is action-packed with some scary sci-fi elements to it. The plot is fast-paced from start to finish; you won't see much fillers or subplots in this movie - lots of roaming and running around in the jungle with non-stop action. The parts where each of the group members attempt to survive the man-eating Skull Crawlers' grasp provided heart-pounding excitement, and the personal agenda of each character give the film suspenseful surprises.The characters were somewhat entertaining, giving off a nice mixture of drama, action and humor. The monster battles were also amusing.There is really nothing in the movie that we haven't seen before in past King Kong films, but have to see this one is miles better than Peter Jackson's 2005 remake of the original 1933 classic.Grade B-",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
You get your money's worth!,"I will admit I was a little skeptical when I first heard about this movie. The whole franchise building thing hasn't worked out well for most studios and frankly the last Godzilla movie was a bit of a dud except for the final act.So, I went to this movie with a little hope of it being any good. And when the movie started I was surprised!I don't think most people will appreciate the human characters because we are not in the theatre to see them, and Tom Hiddleston's English accent is a little distracting. I also didn't know why a Oscar winning actress would want to play a character so thinly written. She is there just so there can be a girl among all the guys. She held her own though, with what she had been given.But let just get to the good part, the hero of this movie is the cinematographer. The scale presented in this movie was outstanding. There is scene where Sam L Jackson is looking at Kong and the camera goes behind his head just to show the difference in scale and size. Each frame was brilliant, the helicopter shots were awesome, and the King fight scenes were better that that of Godzilla!In the end, I had a lot of fun with this one...the movie was funny and commanding. The run time could have been shorter but King Kong beating the hell out of ""stuff"" made up for it!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A monster movie, that delivers exactly what it's supposed to.","Kong: Skull Island is the second movie in Warner Bros. Pictures & Legendary Entertainment's MonsterVerse, after Godzilla(2014). A group of scientists, American soldiers, a British secret service agent & a photojournalist, travel to an unknown island in the Pacific. After arriving on the island, they soon discover that it is home to a giant ape, named Kong(Terry Notary). However, soon the group realizes that Kong is not the most dangerous thing on the island. Now, these guys have to do whatever they can to escape from Skull Island.Kong: Skull Island is a great film. This movie doesn't waste too much time establishing the backstories of its various characters. Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts has realized that people have come to watch the titular character in action & not watch the daily lives of its human characters. This is how it surpasses Godzilla(2014). That film took way too much time establishing the human characters & barely highlighted the titular monster. The story is pretty straightforward but, that's what we expect from a movie like this. The visual effects are flawless. The CGI-rendered King Kong, the skull crawlers & various other creatures in the movie, look extremely realistic. The action set pieces are fantastic & look even better in 3D. The highlight of the film is the climactic set piece. The cast do their best, with the star of the show clearly being the mighty ape. Tom Hiddleston is superb as James Conrad. Samuel L. Jackson is spectacular as Preston Packard. Brie Larson is outstanding as Mason Weaver. John C. Reilly is awesome as Hank Marlow. John Goodman is good as Bill Randa. Corey Hawkins is amazing as Houston Brooks. John Ortiz, Tian Jing, Toby Kebbell, Jason Mitchell, Shea Whigham, Thomas Mann, Eugene Cordero & Marc Evan Jackson are brilliant as Victor Nieves, San, Jack Chapman, Mills, Cole, Slivko, Reles & Landsat Steve, respectively. Last but not the least, Terry Notary is mind blowing in his motion capture performance, as Kong. Kong: Skull Island is a must watch for fans of monster movies & everyone who watched Godzilla(2014).

A beautiful looking popcorn movie.,"Kong Skull Island is a beautiful and fun film.I've been looking forward to Kong for quite a while. From what I saw in the trailers, the cinematography and CGI looked amazing. I was worried that the story would suffer from the focus on cinematography and CGI. Thank god it was better than I expected.Here's the good.The cinematography and CGI is amazing in this movie, the best I've seen from any movie this year. Each shot is fantastic and interesting and the CGI is realistic and blends perfectly with the actors.The acting is fun to say the least. Each actor added something to the story, no one was underused and everyone had a purpose. Samuel L. Jackson and Thomas Mann stood out to me. Both of their performances were memorable and entertaining.The story is very fun. It's what I expected but even that is good. It's a story about a group of people that go and investigate this mysterious island right after the end of the Vietnam war. When they arrive, they discover this island is not what they expected. One thing that added a lot to the overall vibe of the film is that it was in a post Vietnam war setting. It added a lot to the entertainment and set a good tone, it wouldn't have been as good as it is without the time period it's set in. The best part of this movie is easily the end credits scene.Here's the bad.The story isn't all that great. I understand that this movie is just trying to be fun, which is perfectly okay, but if you're going to do that you can't take yourself too seriously, and this movie did that. There were a few cheesy parts but they weren't that bad. A few jokes didn't hit with the audience and weren't that funny. The ending of the movie falls flat. The payoff wasn't all that great and happened fairly fast.There was one character that I think took away from the overall quality of the film. John C. Reilly's character wasn't all that great. He overacted for most of the movie and acted like a cartoon. Only some of his jokes hit with the audience.Overall, Kong Skull Island is a good popcorn movie where you can turn off your brain for a while and watch a movie with some A+ cinematography and CGI. The characters have good chemistry with each other, even if some aren't all that great. It's good to see Kong back on the big screen.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pathetic!!,"I thought I was the only person who was disappointed with this movie - how it got a 7/10, I have no idea. Everyone I have asked about it told me not to bother - I wish I had of listened.Please don't confuse this with previous 'Kong' movies - they are worlds apart; and only go to show what happens when you throw a s''tload of money at something to make it supposedly 'spectacular', and end up with nothing but garbage.CGI isn't too bad - once they discover how to get perspective right. Script is woeful - filled with gung-ho attitude and cheap 'kick-ass' dialog which just doesn't work at all within the context of the movie.Storyline - well, it could have been done in half the time. I'm not even sure there is a story in all of this, apart from a group of 'look how mean and brave' we are men going to kill monsters. Mix that with a script that thinks it's from Rambo, and the entire budget, CGI and just about everything else associated with this film becomes a complete waste of time.A real pity - it could have been so so good.1/10",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A 7/10 film that revels in being a 7/10 film. However, I give it an 8.","I saw this film on the same day as Logan, and while that film was great it didn't leave as much of an impression on me as it seems to have done for other people.Kong Skull Island - however - gets me excited thinking about it.Let me clarify. For me there's nothing better than a film that knowingly commits to genre schlock and style. Something which Skull Island does in spades. The film wastes very little time getting to the action, which puts many people off this take but for me was an enormous breath of fresh air. We all know what King Kong looks like, we all know his M.O and we all know how these films go: first a foot, then a hand, then a glimpse here and there before there's a big scene with some screaming woman tied to a post before the monster can be seen in all its glory. Not here. Here we get straight to it, and I appreciate the film for not taking us down the same old path.This film belongs to a new wave of film-making which is using pulp and new technology to carve its own film language. The influences here don't come from the oft dug classic directors and films - the influence here is pop-culture, pulp and anime. It sounds like a recipe for the most juvenile and dumb crap ever - but in choosing which elements to lift from each of these carefully, the film manages to create something really interesting. There's spots here of 50's B sci-fi, Vietnam movies and studio Ghibli films and it creates a very textured and rich set of visual moments.On that note, this is a very visual and visceral film. The characters are pretty stock here - though enjoyable enough to watch, especially John C Reilly and Samuel L Jackson, who chew through the jungle with aplomb - their motivations are about as straightforward as you can get. The majority of the cast just want to get off the island except for Jackson, who wants to blow the hell out of a giant monkey and then get off the island (largely because he's salty about the U.S pulling out of 'Nam and wants to have a victory).The straightforward narrative is pretty perfect for this sort of film, as there's nothing worse than a B-movie trying and failing to do complex character motivation (well there is, a serious film trying and failing, because then you don't even have the popcorn factor to fall back on). The objectives are all clear and nothing gets in the way of the action.Which is amazing. Everything you want from this sort of creature feature is here. Giant spiders, weird dinosaurs giant octopuses all make an appearance and are combated in a variety of crazy and inventive ways. If you don't get a little quiver of excitement as Kong smashes a snake monster with a rusty anchor from a shipwreck then you are not wired for this sort of film.Anyway, it's great fun",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"It's a movie, that's for sure","Kong: Skull Island is fun, no denying that. I was hoping for a little bit more depth than it offered. That's not to say anyone was bad in it at all, they were simply not brought together in a very strong manner.Being a fan of Peter Jackson's Kong it's hard not to go into this wondering how it might compare. Whilst Jackson's Kong is a nice retelling of the original, this is definitely your Die Hard 5 version of King Kong. That is to say, the characterization, the sense of doom, even the tugging of the heart strings in Jackson's Kong do not cross over into Skull Island at all.The characters here are 2 dimensional, with only one having a name I remember (because it's the same as a computer manufacturer) and I'm fresh out of the cinema earlier this evening. Oh and Kong of course, he's one I can name...! ""That's what I call them... You call them what you want"" line in the movie can definitely be applied to the characters in this film, they honestly could be called tom dick and harry and it'd have no different effect.But, given that this is a more in-line with the Godzilla franchise (and apparently a setup for a Godzilla sequel?) it does provide much more thrills and spills than the more recent Godzilla movie, giving a hint that at least the Kong vs Godzilla movie could be entertaining enough.There are a few nice action sequences. I'm not really sure what made up the rest of the film, in my mind, some silly stuff, like covering several miles in seemingly seconds, second-rate banter & monsters coming out of nowhere clichés left right and centre.So it's fun. Come the ending I was ready to leave and didn't bother with whatever showed over the credits. It was fine as a no-brainer action movie, but it was a very mediocre ride for the Kong fan in me. Worth a watch, if you can flush any interest in any earlier Kong film's first - but that's just my opinion. 6/10!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Barely tolerable pablum,"Watching this movie is like being harassed my a semi hard clown colored dildo after you've had a nice dinner and all you want to do is sit back and relax.

good ingredients but with familiar results,"In the early 1970s, a government team is assembled for a portentous exploration of a mysterious, uncharted island in the Pacific. Among them are a former British SAS officer paid to act as an expert tracker and mercenary, a government agent who may know more than meets the eye, a fanatical U.S. Army officer commanding the military escort, and a photojournalist with a different agenda altogether. Naturally, their journey turns into one of nonstop peril when they encounter a various assortment of dangers along the way. Well-cast, occasionally exhilarating, with more than enough special effects to please the eye, but doesn't provide much of anything that you haven't already seen in previous renditions. **½",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best Kong since the original!,"Finally, after being disappointed by film after film after film after film this year we have the only film other than Hidden Figures that has lived up to my expectations. Kong: Skull Island is easily the best film about Kong since the original. The story takes place in 1973 as the Vietnam War is coming to an end which, in my opinion, sets a great atmosphere for what is about to come. The backstory feels a little rushed, especially for a two hour film, but that means we don't have to wait very long for the main character to make his appearance. There are many elements and story lines which mirror the original story while still telling a new one. Visual effects are wonderful, as is the soundtrack. Kong: Skull Island is definitely worth seeing, and even more so if you have the opportunity to see it in IMAX 3D. P.S. Don't forget to stay for the added scene after the final credits.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Kan't Believe It's This Good.,"It had only been 12 years since Peter Jackson's remake of King Kong. When Kong: Skull Island referenced ""Heart Of Darkness"", even if it's by way of ""Apocalypse Now"", I was groaning. (Some character's names seem to be reference Conrad's Heart of Darkness)Then, Bri Larson finds herself face to face with the big guy. And hey, it worked. Kong's heroic character in this one is very welcome. And it seems to work considerably better than in 2005. Kong even lets Bri stroke his snout, but never has an issue with Tom Hiddleston standing beside her. He's not love sick as in 2005.Samuel Jackson chews up more scenery than the monsters. But that adds to the fun. John C. Riley adds a marvelous touch as a WW2 soldier stuck on the island for decades, a little nutty but able to get along with every one.At two hours, this movie is not over-produced, and allows our beloved ape rule as a bad mother-scratcher who has a heart of gold.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Great action and special effects, but suffered in acting and storyline.","The film unfortunately did not reach my expectations - having seen the adverts, which looked promising. I felt from the very beginning the movie was a bit pacey and progressed too fast into the adventure and exploration of the island. There were some parts that were intriguing, especially the special effects, leading into the arrival into the island.However, the film did massively lack in acting, script and general sense of story line. I felt the acting wasn't convincing, and lacked emotion, and did not evoke much emotion within me. The only thing I felt the film had going for it was the incredible special effects, which is why I gave this film a 6 star rating. There were some really great scenes of action, shock and surprise.I believe this film is worth watching, but I wouldn't consider it a personal favourite. Definitely worth a watch though!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Kong is Back and Delivers!,"Kong is Back! Growing up, nothing wrapped up the Thanksgiving holidays like the showings of the Japanese Monster movies (that, and March of the Wooden Soldiers). They were a Thanksgiving staple right along the cranberry sauce and turkey.By today's standards, some younger folks would see them as laughable or amateurish because of their simplistic methods in bringing GIANT monsters to life without the use of Computer Generated Images (CGI).2014 gave us a newer, modern Godzilla. I loved this movie as to me, it paid homage to the classic Godzilla in little ways that some true fans might pick up.This brings me to the subject of this review; KONG: Skull Island. First off, the movie gives us a unique telling of the story by changing the time-line of the story and therefore giving it a different feel to the 2014 Godzilla. The CGI was fantastic and they even went as far as to have Kong stand more erect, like the TOHO Studios Kong from the 60's (due to a man being in the Kong suit). The cast all did a fine job and each made their characters interesting. I particularly liked John Goodman and John C. Riley's performances. Tom Hiddleston did a fine job as the male lead and was noticeably slightly buffed up than his portrayal as Thor's brother, Loki. Samuel Jackson played... Samuel Jackson. LOL... The movie stayed on point and covered the science aspect just enough to give it a follow-able story and yet not too much to bore kids in the audience.The 3D effects in the film really stood out and were not overbearing or obnoxious. There were plenty of creatures to keep Kong occupied and us entertained throughout the story.If you do plan on seeing this... please stay to the very, very end of the end credits. Have fun and see you at the movies!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"An entertaining and thrilling movie in several scenes, and a promising ending","It isn't like the classic version of King Kong, it is only focused on action, there is no city, much less the Empire State, only an unexplored island. Captain James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) is hired as a guide for the expedition, as well as Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackaon) and his platoon, photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson) and other members to join the expedition. A few minutes from being in air territory, the helicopters are shot down by King Kong and the survival of the characters begins. In the course of history will be revealed the true intentions of certain members of the expedition causing more setbacks. Despite this they find another ally, Hank Marlow (John C. Reilly), a pilot lost for years who survived within the tribe of the island.Considering that the cast contains an acclaimed British actor, an Oscar winner actress and two actors nominated to the same, I must say that in terms of performance was just acceptable but not beyond that. The script has as pro, to be divided in several events due to the separation of the expedition but not beyond this, the rest will be to escape of the island and to survive the beasts inside the same.As a recommendation, wait for the credits, where it is shown that this movie is just the prelude to a bigger project.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I didn't expect much yet I'm still let down,"The movie is super bad, and it has no real redeeming quality. Maybe photography (?). But like literally the rest of it's aspect are super bad, even for somebody who just wants to watch a movie where a big monkey fights against big stuff and/or humans, or for a movie where big stuff/monkey terrorizes and kills humans (I was expecting the last one but it's not even able to achieve that). There's a lot of nonsensical stuff happening all around, that leaves you wondering when did it happen. There's a lot of unnecessary drama that the slow motion simply makes it even worse. Uninteresting characters which have a slight hint of where they are going, but they don't have enough development to actually get somewhere (a few super bad jokes, the typical ""awkward"" scene that now movies love to have but really just appear in the worst moments). Special effects aren't all that good really (not bad, but not amazing). There's not even enough killing/terrorizing! pretty much all the deaths are of people you barely see nor remember their names, the ones that are supposed to be relevant characters have funny/dumb deaths that end up being for nothing, which only deepens how irrelevant they where because of how bland they were! They show some natives of skull island but since they try so hard to make them all serious and respectable they leave them just as objects with a face that stares at the camera. I think the writers also try to make a statement about unnecessary wars and/or US imperialism but its sustained on like two or three lines and a few bad scenes, so even that is lost. Along with all of that the movie is super long so it makes you wonder where did all that time go inside the movie. Overall, a super bad movie by all standards, it tries so hard to be so serious but it's just plain bad.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The animals in the movie are depicted incorrectly at size,"In King Kong 1 the Kong was depicted about 1 ton of weight, this size is suitable for this animal to lodge and live in the forest. But in this Kong 2, the Kong was likely equal at size to the islands, how can the Kong survive during bad weather like rains, storm...? No place could be a shelter for it. This is a problem of size. One more thing, in real world the buffalo is usually equal or bigger at size to the monkey, but in this movie the buffalo is much smaller than the monkey.The appearance of the Asian girl ( maybe Chinese) does not go with the circumstance. Her skin is too bright and not much dirt-stained like the others during the terrible adventure. She doesn't look like the one who knows how to use a gun. She looks more like a clerk working in the office. - This Kong 2 is a revenge for Kong 1. in the Kong 1, the human tried to protect their world being trespassed by a huge creature and the Kong finally died, however it wasn't the Kong's fault. The audiences were hurt by viewing Kong 1. but in this Kong 2 the Kong was trying to kill the trespasser to his own land. The audiences ' mind can settle down after viewing Kong 2. - The image is beautiful and perfect.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Review - Kong: Skull Island - Surprisingly enjoyable.,"Man, the tone in this film is all over the place and I mean that in the best way possible. It never stops feeling strange, but it also never feels wrong, either. We'll be enjoying a light-hearted scene set to the tune of a '70s rock song. Suddenly, gruesomely, fatally, we have a terrifying encounter with an enormous monster. Then we're back with another '70s hit over a montage as our protagonists journey to their next obstacle. It's bizarre, and it works.If you're expecting to see that same Kong story with which you are familiar, alter those expectations radically. Kong never leaves Skull Island, never kidnaps a blonde, and is around five times larger than you've ever seen him before (unless you saw Japan's 1962 film King Kong vs. Godzilla). Unlike the original film, Skull Island is set in 1973, immediately after Nixon pulls out of Vietnam, and, oh, boy, do the filmmakers have fun with this. As well as the aforementioned soundtrack, the score, cinematography, even the film's posters all channel the era, with nods to Apocalypse Now sometimes taking up entire scenes.This isn't to take away too much from the creativity of the film. The excellent cinematography is the work of Larry Fong, who's done a bunch of Zack Snyder films, and the CGI is phenomenal, with a couple of very small exceptions with regard to the small(er) animals that drifted just a little too far into the uncanny.Our characters (a helicopter squadron and a group of scientists, neatly separated by colour, as well as a tracker, a photographer, and three members of the mysterious organisation ""Monarch"", which you may remember from 2014's Godzilla) head to the strange island after picking it up for the first time via satellite (what if something good's there and the Russians get it!?). After Kong, they also meet the other denizens of the island – enormous buffaloes and spiders, new, fictional monstrosities, and good old human natives. At this point the objectives of the characters divide; some want to flee the island, some want to hide and wait for rescue, others still enter Ahab territory and are resolved to take down the big gorilla himself.The screenplay has obviously gone over a couple of drastic revisions. Characters say things like ""this happened in '72"", which is a little weird, because the film is set in '73. Why not just say ""last year""? I can only guess that the year in which the film is set changed during pre/production.Tom Hiddleston and John Goodman are solid. Brie Larson and Samuel L. Jackson somehow manage to deliver excellent performances in a very silly (but fun!) movie. John C. Reilly is great, blending that great sense of humour and timing with just the right dosage of sobering heartbreak that comes with being stranded on an island for thirty years; he crashed during World War II.Many cute references are sprinkled throughout the film, and done so in a charmingly subtle way; ""Hold onto your butts"" says Jackson's character. I breathed a sigh of relief when they elected not to actually play Ride of the Valkyries during an already extremely Apocalypse-Nowy sequence. It's actually a pretty clever movie, and I was very pleasantly surprised.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I like it but...,"I entered this movie with negative expectation. however, I find it a fine movie with a good graphics and story line.the thing I didn't like was the ending. it was very fast. and the characters has less talking to declare there ideas and emotion.but at the end of the movie I really enjoy it and how King kong new movie look like. And the acting was so amazing.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Kong is fun but don't expect too much!,"Going into this film I had low expectations. But I was pleasantly surprised coming out of the theater that this movie kept my attention for as long as it did.The cast of this film: Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, John Goodman and John C. Reilly all do adequate jobs here. I describe it as adequate because no one's performance was mind-blowing or terrible they just did the job and went about the movie. Does this make you hate the characters? Not really but Sam L. was channeling Captain Ahab from Moby Dick thru parts of this movie.But does it make you care about them? Not really either.Overall the plot is really nothing special, SURVIVE is basically it. The action thru the parts of the film are exciting to watch but it does suffer from some slower moments which seemed like they wanted to build up tension but never really surfaced. Deaths came off a bit jump-scary but nothing too crazy bad but you can tell by the end they are setting up and world building to something bigger. Fun for the for the older kids with a bit of scares here and there. 7/10 -- Definitely could watch while doing house work in the background.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Skull Island isn't impressively intelligent but it is overwhelmingly gorgeous and a kickass spectacle worthy of the big screen.,"Right from its opening scene - a cheesy montage that would come into play during the second half of the film - Kong: Skull Island is a reiteration that size matters at the movies. If BIG is what you want, then that's exactly what you get – big budget, big effects and an ape, much, much bigger than his cinematic forefathers from the 1933 classic to the 2005 epic from Peter Jackson. But unlike Jackson's bitter-sweet romanticization of beauty and the beast (which has always been at the heart of a King Kong film) Skull Island is neither a prequel nor a sequel in Kong's storyline. It isn't entirely a reboot either because none of the characters from the previous films are brought back in this film. Instead, this version feels like a pilot episode in its own cinematic universe.Set in 1973 and just after US forces have all but accepted defeat in Vietnam, we follow a group of explorers and American GIs who set out to geo-map the titular but unchartered island. Their grand entrance into the storm shrouded island is the first of a series of kickass spectacles and essentially why you would want to watch this film on the biggest screen possible. It's also the new Kong's awesome introduction in all his colossal gloryand fury. After their Hueys are extended the same welcome as annoying mosquitoes, the group is divided into two teams in an increasingly hostile environment. One team is led by John Goodman's government agent posing as a scientist along with Samuel L. Jackson in a cakewalk role as a vengeful Vietnam veteran. Led by Tom Hiddleston as a tracker and Brie Larson as a war photographer (who serves no real purpose except the tradition that Kong has a thing for blondes), the second team makes an interesting discovery – a stranded WWII pilot (John C. Reilly) is just as eager to leave the island as they are.What sets this film apart from previous Kong lore is the instantly noticeable visual splendour, an aesthetic that seems like a very obvious love letter to Apocalypse Now (1979) but mixed with the cheese and chowder of a Jurassic Park adventure. This in turn wreaks havoc on the tone of the film, resulting in constant shifts between bombastic action, dead-eye terror, pop culture, political and ecological allegories, and whimsy humour including show stealing levity from Reilly. Add to that a stellar cast stuck with stereotypical roles in a telegraphed screenplay and you get an old school monster movie mash with teeth bigger than its bite. But then, who are we kidding? Anyone paying to watch this film will expect their money's worth of copious eye candy and that's precisely what Skull Island promises in return.Despite being a novice behind the lens, director Jordan Vogt-Roberts can be credited with the creation of a tentpole film that is overwhelmingly gorgeous even if it isn't impressively intelligent. Spectacular action, photorealistic CGI, surreal cinematography, and era specific soundtrack will keep you entertained but it's the deliberate tease at the end that will leave you wanting more. If not New York, maybe Japan? Come 2020, we'll know for sure.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not quite right,"I watched, I enjoyed, but it didn't quite flow, the connection of characters didn't seem right, people i saw early appeared later and I thought ""where had they been""? It seemed there was a fleeting attempt to connect Kong with the female lead (twice maybe), but was I expecting too much after the previous Kong movie and remakes *2. I think new audience's will enjoy, but if you haven't seen the previous 3 which are all based on the same story, take the time to see them, the 2005 version is my favourite.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Because of course we must get that Shared Universe rolling,"I'm not sure why he who must not be confused with Mighty Joe Young needed an update. The visual effects of the new King Kong movie are more spectacular and in-your-face than those of Peter Jackson's film, but I suspect you understand why that doesn't necessarily make them better and I hope it goes without saying that they're not as mind-boggling as that which Willis O'Brien pulled off in 1933. The only thing they did was make the ape bigger so why did we even need to see this reboot? Simple. Because we need to get the cinematic universe based around the new Godzilla rolling, because Lord knows every fictional character ever invented needs a cinematic universe now. Why even go to the movies if there aren't 20 other movies that you kinda-sorta-not-really have to see beforehand?Of course Godzilla has had a multi-picture franchise in the past, including one fight with a resized Kong, but this was back when people didn't run a risk of getting tired of the idea. Then again, I've watched enough Cinemassacre to get a decent idea of how good the original Toho films were so maybe I'm wrong. And besides, when you've got CGI on your side, I hear audiences are not so stubborn these days after all.Kong: Skull Island takes place in the 1970's so one might think of it as a quasi-sequel to the original King Kong tale. John Goodman, as government official Bill Randa, assembles a team of scientists, US soldiers, and others to go on an expedition to a hidden island in the South Pacific and discover just why it has kept itself off mankind's maps. It doesn't take long before they realize that ancient forces roam there, and that there is very little hope of them leaving the island or avoiding the horrors that threaten them. This includes, I'm sure you've figured out, a towering gorilla who needs no introduction.The team in question contains Tom Hiddleston as a retired SAS Captain and Vietnam veteran, Brie Larson as a photographer whose presence in the first manned mission to an anomalous island surrounded by a perpetual thunderstorm is at best disagreeable, Corey Hawkins as a geologist working under John Goodman and trying to put the moves on a young biologist played by Jing Tian, Toby Kebbell as a US Major who yearns for home, John C. Reilly as a lost World War II pilot who has lived amongst the island natives for quite some time, and several other characters that exist only to be killed off. Terry Notary provides the motion-capture for Kong (why apes in film can't ever have the same limitations on their ability to emote as real-life Hominidae I know not) but it feels like wasted effort. Usually when he appears in this movie, he doesn't do anything terribly important and is mostly there to fill a screentime quota so as to keep the ""just show the damn monster"" crowd happy.It's astonishing how little King Kong actually does in this movie, and how you change your mind about wanting to see him do things once it finally happens and promptly goes on for too long. The rest of the film is dedicated to abrupt moments of action that are forgotten about as suddenly as they appear and cut together in such a way that there's very little time to wrap your head around which characters are in which group and where that group is at the moment. I can't say we ever get to know any of them especially well either (which would be why Gareth Edwards' Godzilla was more successful in its decision to focus on the humans more than the monsters), nor do we get a solid idea of who our main protagonist is. Samuel L. Jackson, whom I forgot to mention, makes up a walking ""stubborn military leader who refuses to listen"" cliché so that one's easier.Throughout the film, all I could think about were other things that it reminded me of. The first half or so feels so much like a video game it's fascinating. First we get the obligatory 20 minute cutscene; then the gameplay suddenly starts and prompts you to use the WASD keys to dodge lightning strikes and later Kong himself; then we get another cutscene; then we get a random boss fight against a titanic spider where you need to hit its weak spots to kill it.Other than that, Kong gets most of its ideas from other films. The subterranean lizards that Kong fights look like the Cloverfield monster with fewer appendages, the forced banter between the army guys feels like something out of a less genuine Black Hawk Down, and there are several homages to Jurassic Park which, distracting as they may be, are admittedly a bit more intentional. It also brought to mind Aliens, Apocalypse Now, and the works of Michael Bay in general - with its CG fireballs, overused slow-motion, shots of helicopters against sunset backgrounds, and awkwardly inserted comedy. The characters aren't much smarter than your standard Michael Bay inventions either.Kong isn't entirely worthless. The visual effects team, the camera people and the sound designers have done a great job giving King Kong an awesome presence, and some of the references to old Toho kaiju have a charm to them. These aren't spoilers, by the way. Nothing is a spoiler anymore. The cliffhanger at the end of this film's credit sequence will not shock you if you have open eyes and ears and know that Legendary Entertainment have already announced Godzilla vs. Kong. Here's hoping the next Pacific Rim plays into it somehow.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An Excellent Movie,"""Kong: Skull Island"" roars out with a cast that is strong all down the line. Tom Hiddleston (James Conrad) and Samuel L. Jackson (Preston Packard) were both strong choices, Hiddleston for his star power inability to outshine Jackson or Brie Larson (Mason Weaver)and Samuel L. Jackson who made me hate him.The story expands in unexpected ways as Hank Marlow (John C. Reilly), a soldier living on Skull Island since world war two and a group of scientists, Viet-Nam soldiers, a journalist, and a paid guide try to survive in Kong's uncharted world.The harmony throughout this movie is as breathtaking as the beautiful jungle vistas. Kong feels the blood tie with Mason when she touches her hand to his face, Packard and Conrad use their respective ranks to quietly separate the civilians and the military men, and Kong's battles with the ""Skullcrawlers"" are savage killings.This movie hits all the high notes with singularity and credit goes to Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts for making a masterful film.

Might be the worst monster movie of alltime.,"This maybe the worst monster movie of all time.
Wait... is Sharknado a monster movie?
Well, it doesn't really matter, cause this is probably worse than Sharknado.The story is absolutely ridiculous. It started of ok, somewhat plausible but as the movie went on, it quickly deteriorated into more and more absurd.There is a female lead, a photographer. She is clearly there to be the female heroine and save save the day. But there is absolutely no thought as to how she should do it. This makes her role, her lines stupid to the extreme.
Three people walk onto a wild island and see a giant monkey.
The military guy says ""lets kill it"".
The scientist guy says ""lets study it"".
The female photographer heroine says ""this is crazy, stop"".
Somehow, everyone listens to the photographer who has no survival skills, no military skills and no scientific knowledge. She didn't even say anything, didn't even give any instruction on what to do but everybody stops arguing, after all ""it's crazy"".
Now, since the argument is over and she didn't propose any farther topics of discussion, what does the movie do? Well, why not just cut to the next scene with a shot of the giant monkey.Oh yeah, lets not forget that Kong is indestructible. It can not be killed by bullets, nor explosives, nor burn in fire. Even it's fur doesn't burn in fire, much less skin.Listen, and understand! That Kong is out there! It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop... ever, until this movie is awful!",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best of the Kong remakes,"The original 1933 film King Kong was such a hit that studios have been reviving the big ape ever since. There were sequels, there were a couple of Japanese things, and in the 70s there was a painfully slow and tedious movie only notable for containing Jessica Lange's all- time worst performance.More recently Peter Jackson attempted to turn the story into a LOTR- style epic, resulting in a few good scenes drowned in sheer bulk.Skull Island is in some ways a return to the simplicity of the original. There's a giant ape on an island of monsters, there's a bunch of people getting killed, and there's a lot of action.The shortest Kong movie in some time, coming in at well under two hours, the film gets in a lot of action and even has room for a madness-of-war, Vietnam-inspired undercurrent (which feels a little random but basically works).The best action scene is Kong versus the helicopters. It's a very intense sequence that, like many scenes in the movie, is a sort of call-back to something in the original. It's unfortunate that the movie can't match that scene elsewhere, but it's generally quite entertaining all the same. I do think it's possible that if you edited the Jackson film from 3 hours to the length of this one it might be the better movie, but based on what was released, Skull Island is easily the best Kong reboot.Skull Island isn't too attached to the original story, which is fine by me. It even virtually ditches the whole ape/girl romance, which went from obsessive love in the original to weirdly sexual in the 70s to girl-as-pet from Jackson to a sort of mutual respect thing in this one.The movie also stays on the island - no empire state building this time around. There's room for a sequel, but I hope this franchise continues to do its own thing.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not satisfied.,"Okay, let's just say this movie was good but not good enough to catch the eye of a true king Kong fan. Comparing this to the previous king Kong movies, this was poorly developed. It didn't satisfy my requirements since I have seen even better Kong movies.The acting was far from worst tho not the best. I was disappointed because I expected more. One of its major problems was the villain lizard thingy in the movie which for the whole entire movie concentrated on. King Kong is supposed to contain different dinosaurs all with the aim of killing. The other king Kong movies had that under their grip but this concentrated too much on the lizard which even didn't really impress me.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Highly visual and fun adventure.,"I am truly puzzled as to why this film got such bad reviews. Because of them I avoided it, but a day on the couch with a virus led me to give it a go, and I'm glad I did - it's fun and entertaining.
The photography and vfx truly stunning. The story is what you'd expect from a Kong film with a lot of the usual Kong clichés, but it wouldn't be a Kong film without them.
It has a very contemporary message about the the insanity of the conflict between humanity and nature,to whom the earth really belongs.
Kong himself is magnificent, and the film style is something like a cross between Jurassic Park and the early Tomb Raider games. It is far better than the 2005 Peter Jackson version.

Very enjoyable action adventure creature feature. Better than Peter Jackson's KIng Kong.,"One of my favourite pop corn movies of the last few years.
This is a very easy watch with a great cast, impressive special effects and a surprisingly dark tone in places with some gory and gross moments.
The action scenes look amazing and are highly stylised using bright colors, smoke and explosions to great effect and the monsters look awesome especially Kong. You can see individual hairs on his body and wrinkles on his leathery palms, it's very cool. Apparently the monster designs were influenced by Studio Ghibli's Princess Mononoke and i can actually see that.You'd be silly going in to this expecting an Oscar winning tour de force like There Will Be Blood, this a high octane action adventure movie with massive monsters bashing the hell out of eachother. There isn't much character development but everyone still provides a decent performance especially Samuel L Jackson as a hard as nails and pretty unlikeable US army Lieutenant Colonel who needs war to survive. John C. Reilly is also a joy to watch.
There's a lot of small moments and details which you might not see first time round as well and i like that.

"Decent monster flick with many, many technical problems.","Quite a few issues I had with it, but overall I enjoyed it. LOVED the shots, the imagery, cgi for the creatures and Kong. Sam L. Jackson and John C. are American treasures. Enjoyed most of the characters, surprisingly except for Loki and Captain Marvel. Really took me out of it at times, those two. No spoilers but I love who we discover who the true antagonist is. Also, don't leave. In classic Marvel fashion, post- credits scene, DO NOT LEAVE. The editing - really annoyed me as well. And the humor. Jackson and John C. both had only one moment that made me actually laugh, and I feel like both lines they delivered were ad libbed. The many many slow-mo action shots got under my skin as well. I noticed this film also borrowed a few shots, classic pieces of imagery from Jurassic Park. The many many slow-mo action shots got under my skin as well. The bad writing and line delivery, and Hiddleston, Kebbel, and Larson's characters were just bad.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Look out for this 'chest-thumping' ape blow out your chances of ESCAPE!!,"King Kong has fascinated movies makers for decades now and Kong : Skull Island is the latest spin off on this 'larger than life chest-thumping' ape .Kong boasts of an ensemble cast comprising of seasoned actors like Samuel L. Jackson, John Goodman & John C. Reilly besides Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson (of Room fame). The movie takes all these characters to the mysterious Skull Island where not just Kong but a string of other creatures awaits them. What starts as a geological expedition eventually turns into a game of survival.Tom Hiddleston plays one of its kind action hero who does not get to fire a single bullet throughout the movie but he does manage to break off his 'godly' image with this movie. Brie Larson is vibrant as the 'anti-war photojournalist' who lands up exactly in the middle of a war like situation. It's great to see John Goodman and especially John C. Reilly come back in their true form and give some great performances here. Now coming to Samuel L. Jackson, who does it simply with his eyes. No actor could dare stare back at King Kong with the kind of hatred in his eyes, the way he does. His character has multiple layers and he showcases shades of grey here. All said and done, the cinematography by Larry Fong is outstanding. Each and every shot in the movie is beautiful. A monster adventure movie has to have some great camera-work and the camera-work in Kong is the highlight of the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pretty disappointing,"It is a shame that Kong Skull Island is not even okay. The movie starts with John Goodman who want to go to this place called Skull Island. The person he asks it to doesn't want him to go at first but 2 minutes later after John ask 1 more time he suddenly does it without a good reason so that's why they go.The special effects look sometimes really good and sometimes really really bad. The movie doesn't focus on Kong all that much. Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson are the two leading actors I would say, the acting is decent but these characters are really paper thin. If you're characters aren't that good just make the movie about Kong and not these characters we don't care about.Kong Skull Island is a pretty bad movie and I am sad to say so because I really looked forward to this movie. What a shame.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Kong : Skull Island - A shot in the water!,"My opinion---I found this last version of King Kong, the worst of all, with a very bad script and really ridiculous scenes, but there were some very nice special effects and I must say that Kong was superb, 'Annoy not once the first half hour past, it's always entertaining these movies.

The Beast which never loved the girl.,"""King Kong"" has always been the story about the might beast that fell in love with a woman who eventually causes his death. This has been the story from the 30s till the extraordinary remake by Peter Jackson. However, this movie doesn't stick to the rituals of the story, as it tells the story of the beast in his own land, without the famous Empire State Scene, without being captured. The Graphics are great, however, there has not been much development between this version and Jackson's version technically. Having a cast consisting of super talented actors like Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larsson, Samuel L. Jackson, John C. Reilly and John Goodman. However, their performances were very average except Reilly maybe. The opening scene of the movie was very very good. Incorporating Kong in a fight with Godzilla -which is the next move for this universe- would be pretty tough as Kong is much smaller and Godzilla is a lot stronger. We are talking about a beast which can breathe Fire against an ape. However, it is gonna be fantastic watching that battle. Skull Island borrows lots of elements from Apocalypse Now. You'd feel that you are watching a second part of it only this time, Marlon Brando has evolved and became this giant ape. I believe that this borrowing was to make the movie more acclaimed, Yet the ultimate result of the movie is that it's a fun ride that is easily forgettable and would never stick to anyone's mind just like Godzilla. The only difference is that Godzilla was a sequel to an awful movie while Kong was following a very good one. Perhaps the comparison between King Kong and Skull Island have hurt the movie",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Thrill Island Adventure,"Kong: Skull Island is a really enjoyable film that tells us who Kong himself is and how dangerous Skull Island can be. This also does contain great visuals and incredible cinematography that shows us the world of Skull Island. The one thing that surprises me is how thrilling the movie can be. I won't spoil the movie, but there can be times it would contain bloody scenes. And the action is stunningly engaging. Maybe there can be some issues like how the characters are pretty weak and the story isn't the best for a monster movie. But those cannot keep this from being a fun adventure action movie. If you're a fan of monster movies and would like to see more of an island Kong lives, this can be the one to check out. In fact, I thought it was better than the 2014 Godzilla movie. It may not be the best monster movie, but I can say this is one of the better King Kong movies out there.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Unrealistic, contrived, full of clichés, poor acting, poor storytelling, poor script writing- it's got it all.

I would have then walked out, but the tiredness from my sleep compelled me to stay.

"An absolute blast ! This is what a monster movie should be, take notes, filmmakers :)","Woooow, am I super surprised of what I had just seen...
Kong: Skull Island is everything I wanted it to be, and even more! I love a good popcorn flick, I love a good monster movie, and I certainly love good adventure movies, but it can be said that they are very, very rare. Kong: Skull Island did just that. Yes, the characters are one, maybe two-dimensional, yes the story is full of cliches, the characters are stereotypical, but, me, personally, I was captured by the movie.The visual effects are absolutely spectacular, I can't recall better CGI, compared to this epic movie, except the new Planet Of The Apes trilogy, maybe. The cinematography was sooo beautiful, the sceneries were astonishing, there were moments were I just stood with my mouth open, trying to digest the gorgeous creation, that the crew of this film showed us. The first and the last battle scenes were amazing, I have never seen such a beautiful destruction in a movie. The director of photography showed us miraculous and stunning imagery, very, very colourful. I just loved the scene where Conrad was slashing blue-blooded pterodactyls with a samurai sword, while green poison gases were exploding in the background.I loved that the movie was not shy to show us some violence, besides the PG-13 rating, it was pretty brutal at times. Not many box-office hits do this. The 2 hours passed by magically, I was so engrossed by the magic of this place. The monster battles and the other creatures designs were darn creative.I am a big fan of dramas, big fan of movies full with life lessons and meaning, but c'mon, guys, this was special. We have to give the credits, when something is so professionally made. The example I can think of (because, mostly I am a horror movie fan) is the first Conjuring. That movie was a huuge cliche, but it was soo well made, that it became one of the best modern horror movies. Same az this gem.I dunno, maybe it's just because i love jungles, and I love war movies, but judging by most of the top reviews, I am not alone.Recommended with two hands for everybody!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Kong: Skull Island Review,"I hope I wasn't the only one who was excited to see Kong: Skull Island. I wasn't disappointed, nor was I impressed. The movie was what I thought it was going to be. Allow me to go further.Synopsis: A diverse team of scientists, soldiers and adventurers unite to explore a mythical, uncharted island in the Pacific, as dangerous as it is beautiful. Cut off from everything they know, the team ventures into the domain of the mighty Kong, igniting the ultimate battle between man and nature. As their mission of discovery becomes one of survival, they must fight to escape a primal Eden in which humanity does not belong. Starring: Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L. Jackson, Brie Larson, John Goodman Director: Jordan Vogt-RobertsFirst thing: How many Marvel actors can this put in this one movie? Apparently there are rumors out there that Mr. Goodman is going to be part of the MCU here soon as well. You will not hear me complain about that.So, let's get the vegetables out of the way. There are two things that hurt the movie more than anything else. One was that almost all the action scenes were made to be slo-mo. All it did was add time to the movie. If the action would have been normal speed there could have been ten minutes taken out. Sure, the slo-mo was able to add more to the scenes, but it just became senseless after a while.The other thing was the initial humor. The un-initial humor was okay, but when people tried to be funny in the movie, it only hurt. I know John C. Reilly was added for the humor, but it didn't work in the long run.The best thing about this movie? Sam L. Jackson. Sure, you can tell what he was going to do from the time you saw him first pop up on the screen, but it was fun waiting for it. He played the part perfectly.The other actors, aside from Mr. Reilly, were good in their roles. Tom and Brie played off each other quite well. Sadly we won't get to see them together in another movie. I'll explain that in a minute.Maybe if the director wouldn't have used the slo-mo so much I would say he did a good job. But he didn't, so I won't.The story was perfect for what they were trying to do. They set up the MonsterVerse, as they call it at the production company, in the right way. Using the full name for M.U.T.O. confused quite a few people. Not to toot my own horn, but: toot-toot. I understood what was happening from the second I heard the full name. The after- credits scene only solidified what was happening.Final Thoughts: Watch the movie. It is a fun movie. Of course, watch Godzilla first, then watch this movie. You'll thank yourself for that.Rating: 7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
'Bad' doesn't BEGIN to describe it,"I watched the original KK, the 1970-something remake, the 2005 remake, and ... This. Oh, dear. What can I add to the many other cries of dismay?pIn this latest Hollywood excrement they don't even bother to build up your excitement and expectation. I suppose the writers must have thought, ""Oh, what the heck. By now, everybody knows the protagonists are to stumble into a ginormous monkey. Let's start blowing things up from the get-go instead."" So KK blasts on the screen (and in your face) barely 15 minutes after the opening credits (in a two-hour film).It barrels south from there. Cartoonish, made-in-Japan-like creatures, tons of gooey, revolting gore, silly people, sillier situations. Oh, and did I mention aurora borealis ... In the middle of the South Pacific? Did they leave any cliché out? Nope. Everything is there, right down to the assertive, macho-like, snarky female photographer, who's capable of lifting a helicopter that not even a huge, prehistoric water buffalo could dislodge. Does our Kong fall for the gutsy photographer? Perish the thought! This is the new millennium. Nobody, not eve big apes objectify women. Can't have that. No, once Kong slaps the chopper off the water buffalo's back, he spots the photographer, gives her a regally disdainful look, turns around and walks away. The only part in the film I felt like clapping.As others have pointed out, the dialogue is so bad it makes you cringe even more than the revoltingly gory scenes.All in all, I think it's high time Hollywood was sent to pasture on some Skull Island somewhere far away. I mean, what could go wrong? The Hollywoodians would be devoured by the local fauna. Well, what of it? The film taught us that the critters are prone to regurgitating their lunch. Maybe they'll turn vegetarian. Wouldn't that be adorably politically correct?",,Anonymous,Fantasy

enjoyed it,"""Kong: Skull Island"" roars onto the screen with a thrilling spectacle of giant monsters and awe-inspiring visuals, making it an entertaining entry into the monster movie genre. The cast, including Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson, delivers solid performances amidst the chaos of colossal creatures. The film editing maintains a brisk pace, ensuring the audience is never far from the next jaw-dropping encounter. While the music may not linger in memory, it effectively enhances the tension of the monster-filled narrative. The movie's strength lies in its stunning cinematography, capturing the mythical beauty and danger of Skull Island. However, the weakness emerges in a somewhat predictable plot that doesn't deviate far from the monster movie formula.

"Enjoy being scared with your friends, and see quality cinema at the same time",""". . . The land where God did not finish creation . . . the place where myth and science meet."" Bill Randa (John Goodman)In Kong: Skull Island, the real science is the creation by director Jordan Vogt-Roberts and writers of a believable myth, gigantism run amok with a hundred-foot gorilla and other nasty, very large pre-historic monsters. By paying homage to 1933 filmmakers Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedack's Kong, this film shows myths can be reworked to maintain their original power while complementing the proceedings with new angles of vision.Although Skull Island is a place of death as monsters battle for control, it still houses benign natives and visiting guests like tracker James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) and photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson). The dark side is Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson), who not only represents the tunnel vision of present-day militarism but also the myth of the sexually powerful black man, a cultural companion to the imposing Kong.However, this Kong has grown in sensitivity over 84 years: He protects the island's good denizens from the devils below and he respects the new blonde Fay Wray, Mason Weaver: ""People here used to live in fear, from everything. Then something strange happened: some of the monsters here started protecting them from the other monsters trying to kill them."" Hank Marlow (John C. Reilly).This is a Kong to love more than fear. Gone is the threatening sexuality of the early Kong with his probing fingers; here is a monster more like a schoolboy seeing a beautiful teacher and protecting her.Notable are this film's allusions to Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness (Conrad as last name of this hero and Marlow, Heart's narrator, and the last name of this WW II leftover Hank, played by Reilly with a wry detachment, a welcome antidote to almost everyone else's grave demeanor). The multiple shots of an over-sized sun and makeshift patrol boat leave no doubt of this film's debt to Apocalypse Now.Kong: Skull Island is a modern fable about our collaboration with nature and the menace of the military-industrial complex (consider the current budget proposal's lavish military spending). Beyond that, it's darn good story telling accompanied by state-of-the-art graphics to make the experience a marvel rather than a menace.""Kong's a pretty good king. Keeps to himself, mostly. But you don't go into someone's house and start dropping bombs, unless you're picking a fight."" Marlow",,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Vidiot Reviews...,"Kong: Skull IslandThe most exciting aspect of finding a giant monkey is all the cosmetic testing you can conduct on it.Fortunately, the simian in this adventure picture isn't wearing any mascara yet.Dispatched by the military to map out Skull Island, Lt.

Instead it gets right down to eye-popping creature clashes that excite much more than they engage.Incidentally, the only way to pacify an enormous primate is with a gigantic tire swing.Yellow Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Epic Monsters Fight Horrible Script,"Just because this is a movie about a giant ape on a mysterious island doesn't mean the story needs to be incoherent, the dialogue wooden, and the characters boring. Is it really that hard to keep things realistic while monsters run amuck?
As other reviews have mentioned, there are too many scenes and events that are just impossible to accept. Remember, the audience is already being asked to believe that a giant ape and other monsters exist on this island. Do they also need to buy that helicopters can fly in close formation through a hurricane? There are just too many dumb things that happen that didn't need to happen.
Not everything in this movie sucks. The monster fight scenes are fantastic. Kong, always a creative fighter, uses his brain and his brawn when he goes into battle. The sound design is also great. In fact, I love all of the creature designs. It's just too bad that a dumb story and poorly drawn characters surround these wonderful set pieces.
The Samuel Jackson character is by far the worst one in the movie. The cliched angry military leader who's willing to risk his men and his life for vengeance. Seriously, all the military choices in this movie are horrible and make them seem totally incompetent.
I gave the movie a 6/10 because of the monster fight scenes.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Monstrous Popcorn Flick,"Samuel L Jackson fights CGI monsters in this nostalgia-driven reboot of the 1933 classic King Kong. This is the third remake/reboot of King Kong. Though essential elements of the original remain, Kong: Skull Island (2017) is set in 1973, at the end of the Vietnam War. It is replete with counter-culture references and music from the period, with the addition of a marooned WW2 vet to appeal to Baby Boomers and their parents alike. Nostalgia is the only explanation I have for why this film has gotten such good reviews. The dialog, acting, plot, and CGI are all mediocre. Its only redeeming quality is the ending fight scene between Kong and a giant skullcrawler called Ramarak.The plot is straightforward. Bill Randa (John Goodman), a monster-hunter, attains funding to travel to an uncharted Pacific island under the guise of a geologic mapping expedition. He enlists the help of former British Special Air Service Captain James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston), Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson), and ""antiwar"" photojournalist Mason Weaver (Brie Larson), alongside various Landsat employees.Once over the island, they encounter Kong, who smashes their helicopters. The survivors find a primitive tribe living on the island, alongside a stranded WW2 fighter pilot, Hank Marlow (John C. Reilly). From there, they must cross the island to safety while avoiding over-sized creatures and carnivorous skullcrawlers.While the 2005 Peter Jackson remake staring Jack Black wasn't great either, I preferred that version of Kong. He was essentially just a giant silver-back gorilla, with complex emotions and mannerisms copied from real life. In contrast, this Kong was as tall as a skyscraper, walked upright, and had two emotional states: pensive and roaring loudly. He's also somehow impervious to .30 cal machine gun bullets, fire, and razor-sharp teeth.1973 was an interesting setting for a Kong movie. In many ways this hearkens back to the 1976 remake, which also takes place in the '70s and features a helicopter battle with the monster. The settings, music, props, and cinematography all carefully reflect that period. In this time line, Bill Randa is eager to reach the island before newly launched U.S. satellites can map it, revealing its secrets. Randa sees President Richard Nixon announce troop withdrawal from Vietnam, and determines he must attain funding for his expedition before the war ends and Congress tightens its budget. Historically, the Earth Resources Technology Satellite was launched on July 23, 1972. It wasn't called Landsat until 1975–a minor discrepancy.Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard comes close to being the film's primary antagonist. As commander of an air cavalry squadron, the Sky Devils, Packard is the arch-typical ""warrior without a war."" ""We didn't lose the war,"" he tells Mason Weaver, ""we abandoned it."" He relishes the chance to go on one final mission. When Kong ravages his squadron, destroys his helicopters, and kills his men, Packard becomes obsessed with revenge. He refuses to leave any man behind, taking his remaining troops on what seems like a suicide mission to recover Major Jack Chapman (Toby Kebbell). When Chapman dies, he persists with his determination to kill Kong.While Packard is supposed to the bad guy, he's the only character whose motivations make sense. After Hank Marlow explains Kong has been protecting the tribesmen from skullcrawlers, James Conrad tells Packard that Kong was ""just defending his territory"" when he attacked their helicopters. Uh, OK? Unlike Conrad, who has no emotional ties to any other character, Packard has served with these men in war, presumably for years. He has an obligation to protect his men and recover them if they go missing. Can you blame him for being a little angry when he sees them butchered by a giant ape? Something else bothered me. Throughout the film, the main characters are covered in bile, muck, mud, dirt, blood, smoke, and scorched by flames, yet remain relatively unscathed. Mason Weaver and biologist San Lin (Tian Jing)'s hair and makeup are perfect.They also barely react to their environment. In one scene, they stumble on a boneyard with the skeletons of Kong's parents, killed by skullcrawlers. ""Do you smell that?"" Marlow asks. ""That's death."" Yet no character reacts to the smell at all, probably because they're standing in front of a green screen. Later, Weaver and Conrad stand face-to-face with Kong, again with no reaction. I'm betting a giant gorilla that eats squid smells pretty bad. At least in the 1976 version, Jeff Bridges and Jessica Lange's characters are dirty, wet, and their clothes are torn in the jungle.The movie credits photojournalists like Mason Weaver for ending the Vietnam War, using photographs of war's horrors to stoke antiwar sentiment back home. Likewise, Bill Randa hopes to use photography to prove the existence of monsters on Skull Island. On several occasions, the audience sees the exotic creatures and settings through Weaver's camera lens. In one scene, a skullcrawler swallows Randa and his camera. The camera flash reveals its location in the smoke to the other characters, allowing them to escape. I thought this theme, the power of cameras and photography, was one interesting aspect of this film.Overall, Kong: Skull Island wasn't as bad as its predecessors, but fell short in many critical areas. John C. Reilly, and Samuel L Jackson to some extent (in the vein of Snakes on a Plane and Deep Blue Sea), was there for comic relief, but the jokes fell flat. John Goodman is also traditionally a comedic actor, and Brie Larson is mostly known for playing Natalie ""Envy"" Adams in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. So I wasn't sure whether this was supposed to be a campy, fun monster movie, a commentary on the Vietnam War, or an action-packed adventure film. Whatever it was supposed to be, it never rose above the level of a typical popcorn flick.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Kong is the King,"Man, oh man, was this movie fun! While I liked Peter Jackson's version, this definetly blows it out of the water! It's totally epic! I'm surprised this wasn't released in the summer, because it's definely got that summer blockbuster feel. One criticism people had with 2014's ""Godzilla"" was that it moved too slowly and took forever for Godzilla to actually show up, and I agree. This fixes that mistake by showing Kong in the opening scene to tide us over, and then doing the buildup. The tone and feel of this movie reminded me of ""Indiana Jones."" It's a fun island survival movie. In my opinion, one thing ""Godzilla"" suffered from was the human characters just weren't that interesting. That was not the case here. The characters are written very well, with clear goals and conflicts. The scale of Kong and the island as a whole are impressively huge. Do not watch this movie on your phone. Watch it on the biggest screen possible with an epic sound system for full immersion. Keep in mind the movie, in my opinion, really pushes the PG-13 rating. Some of the violence and deaths can get really brutal. Yet it still manages to balance it out with humor. (Particularly from John C. Reilly's character.) Godzilla had a very dark, bleak, and overall depressing and hopeless tone. (Although those monster fight sequences were awesome!!!!!) This has an action movie tone and is extremely intense at times. Some of the creatures they came up with for the island are really cool, and definetely not stuff I felt I had seen before. It's impressive that a movie that's been remade and redone again and again and again since the 30's still manages to bring something new to the table, while also retaining that classic feel.

*Mostly* Stupid,"I will say first off that I did like the very end with the WWII veteran being United with his family, some of the unique monsters and monster action (like every King Kong movie), etc. However I could not get behind how Samuel L Jackson acted (who is normally a great actor), some of the ridiculous human action sequences (especially with the toxic gas scene), and the hollywoodization of most of the film. Parts were good I suppose, but most of it felt like a crappy Marvel movie given the casting choices and the unconvincing events (even for a movie like this).",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Bad Pacing, Tone Changes Galore, and Horrid Writing","Kong: Skull Island follows a scientist who, upon discovering an uncharted island, decides to take a team there to explore it in the hopes of discovering new species or something of that sort. Coincidentally, that's the same island that King Kong lives on, along with multiple other monsters.The movie basically blows through the whole beginning, introducing the characters and basic motivations. For the most part, I was fine with that, but once they reach the island the characters themselves cease to have character, though they had little before. They're just robots with an objective. When the movie tries to develop two characters' relationship at one point, the conversation is just playful banter that lasts all of 30 seconds. It's a formula for developing characters that has worked to show how well actors can play off each other, but it doesn't work here because of how generic and rushed it is. Furthermore, one particular character gets thrown into the mix way too early. I don't want to spoil his role for those who don't know, but it's John C. Reilly's character. He shows up in the first 30 minutes, and in context it doesn't make sense.I mostly went to this movie because every review I read or watched said that Kong himself was great, so I figured it'd at least be a fun time at the movies that would be better in a cinema. Sure, Kong was good, for all three of his scenes. Seriously, I started to forget that this was a King Kong movie. And it seemed like the writers forgot too, because he kinda just showed up on occasion to remind the audience what the movie was called. He wasn't even the biggest threat on Skull Island, he was just kind of there.As far as the exciting parts of this movie go, the action set pieces are great. They set up for something epic and exciting. But the action itself often falls kind of flat. Sure, it's mostly fun, but it's kind of dumb too. And some shots based around these sets don't make sense. There's a point where the characters are looking down at a dip in the land with giant bones in it. Then they go down and it's full of green fog that varies in thickness. So where did the fog come from? How is it that they could see clearly from above, but barely could from within? It just doesn't make sense, and in Kong's opening scene the time of day constantly switches between midday to late evening, and it's so distracting. Sure, it's a pretty shot, but it took me out of the action, and that isn't a good thing. And in addition to that, a lot of the cool monsters you may have seen in the trailers are better in the trailer than in the movie. Lot's of monster fights happen before we can even care about any of the characters, so when people are dying I was simply detached. But the fights proved to be so short-lived that there was no time to really even get excited. Again, the set pieces are great but the action itself is mediocre.I'm sure most people saw 'The Jungle Book' from 2016 and noticed how great the CGI is. So my question now is, how is it that a whole year later we can get bad CGI? Seriously, there were scenes in this movie where the monsters and the characters were together and it looked horribly fake. It was actually pretty cringe-worthy at times, and I did. A lot. It got to the point where my friend next to me asked if I wanted to leave. I still saw it through, though. But man, it all looked so fake. It looked like a video game, and not one where graphics were the main concern. The monsters themselves were cool, sure, but they just didn't look real.And on top of that, the tone was all over the place. First the characters are excited, then it's serious, then their laughing and playing records and having fun, then their dying, then they start laughing again. It's like it tried to use comedy sometimes but instead they just destroyed the tone. It was so inconsistent in this way, and again it distances the audience from the movie. It abruptly removes you from where you just were to relocate you to a new box of feelings, and that journey is just awkward and weird. It's like the movie really doesn't know what it is, but it's trying to find itself.Despite all this, the movie gets better towards the end. By the last half hour, it is where it should have been at the beginning in terms of characters. So there was a level of excitement, and the expected fight with Kong versus big bad monster proves to be a great time, and moreover tends to be rather well shot.Overall Kong: Skull Island was a movie where the lack of characters made it difficult to get invested, and as such the result was a garbage fire. It's not an enjoyable movie. It's not pretty, it's not interesting, and it's barely even fun. The actors tried their best with what they were given, and I admired how willing the movie was about killing off major characters at points other than the very end, but still there was nothing to save this movie where it was. There is a good movie hidden in here somewhere, I am certain of that, but it isn't this one. In the end I would advise you to avoid this movie and wait for it to come to Netflix if you haven't seen it, like the last Godzilla movie did. Contrary to expectations of excitement, this is a rather boring movie, and the price of admission is simply not worth your hard-earned money.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Strong Tone,"I love the tone and colors of Kong: Skull Island. There is a unique feel to this movie that resonates with my cinematic tastes. The cast is strong, with great actors and performances across the board (I actually didn't mind Brie Larsen). The smoke and mirrors of Project Monarch is interesting, especially with the tension leading up to the island arrival.The actual character of Kong was underdeveloped, but the groundwork is set for future growth. I enjoyed seeing a little bit of his history, but again, there could have been a stronger explanation of why Kong is treated as the king.Great movie. Lots of fun. I could watch it again tomorrow and still enjoy it.Best Character: Hank Marlow

"Strong visuals, good star power, but weak story and clichéd characters","An expedition goes to Skull Island along with a military escort.This is an okay film with more good points than bad.The story and characters are fairly basic, but there is a decent tongue-in-cheek humour that underlies everything. It's fun seeing what happens to the human characters and you definitely route for King Kong all the way.There is some unsubtle but provocative imagery showing humans raping the environment that works quite well, particularly to make you want them to suffer at the teeth of the numerous monsters.The climactic showdown pitting certain monsters against each other and involving the human characters is an entertaining spectacle to watch.Generally the visuals are excellent. It has some strong cinematography, colour grading, and art design that pays tribute to other movies like 'Apocalypse Now', 'Platoon', 'Jurassic Park' and the original 'King Kong'. If you place a lot of importance on computer generated imagery then you will love the creature animation.I think having a cast with John Goodman, Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, Samuel L Jackson, and John C Reilly helps lift a fairly weak script and make it more watchable than it should be.There is a cracking soundtrack that includes a number of great songs, but I can't help but feel they are largely wasted in a movie like this other than to give a sense of period.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Another Case of  Big Budget Gives You Small Quality,The opening act of Kong Skull Island stated off strong with a well imagined 1973 with a scientific mystery reluctantly green lighted for an odd government agent with scientist in tow that recruits an intrepid explorer and a Colonel yearning for war. The movie jarred me from reality when 5 helicopters dispatched for exploration transforms into an invasion force. I tried to get back into the story yet could not as 1. King Kong was shifting in size at points and always too large for him to relate to humans 2. The indigenous people seemed intriguing yet treated as nothing more than furniture even by a guy who had spent 28 years with them 3. the Colonel turning into a vengeful psycho was not plausible and 4. the real evil monsters struck me as unreal cartoons. I wanted to like this movie as I have liked previous King Kong flicks. What could had been a very good daunting tension filled quest with great fleshed out characters became just a video game.,3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
2017's First Critical MONSTER HIT !!!!!!!!!!,"Kong Skull Island, without a doubt is not only the best King Kong movie but a great monster movie to WATCH this year.

Kong looks like 50 cents,"The movie is just as good as all the Hollywood top movies. Goodman and Jackson act out their parts in the typical Hollywood movie where the impossible seems natural.

A good looking monster movie,"There's not much more to this than ""a good looking monster movie"". More specifically it's a movie about people stuck in an unexplored habitat where they face pre-historic monsters. It's not really a remake of King Kong, because it leaves out most (if not all) iconic moments from the previous versions, and it also tells a story completely of its own.The highlight of the movie is, beyond a doubt, the visuals. There are some glorious shots in this movie, and perhaps the best ones being those that are obviously influenced by previous media set in the Vietnam war era. The creature design is also really neat. King Kong is massive, and he's also definitely not an ape as we know them. They've taken more inspiration from the old doll (from the first movie), than the more natural looking Kong from Jackson's remake. And it works really well! There's other creatures as well, some of them quite neat and interesting. Some of them I would have loved to see more of, but the ""skullcrawlers"" (which are highlights as an important enemy) are disappointing design wise. They look like a generic baddie in a monster film.The plot itself is OK, but there's nothing really special or interesting about it. There are some great performances, but also some talent that is completely wasted in roles with hardly any airtime.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Big dumb monster movie fun that somewhat subverts your expectations,"I think the people who are rating this movie low were expecting an oscar winner here. Its a giant monkey.

Why would you expect this to be more than that?This movie is quite a bit of fun. Surprisingly some of the secondary characters you think are going to make it, don't. They set you up to like the characters at the beginning and then rip it away from you.Its a monster movie.

keep the closing credits -- scrap the rest,"This is the weakest entry in the Monsterverse saga and it shows. The writers aimed for cheap thrills, relying too much on the stoic looks of Sam Jackson (the most over-used actor in Hollywood history) to carry a story which could barely carry itself. The pleasures here are few and far between. Early Brie Larson. Tom Hiddleston doing a VERY impressive rendition of a Rock-style action hero, something his fans never really got to see again. And John C. Reilly using every last ounce of his considerable talent to try to connect his character with the audience, in spite of the very implausible backstory. Ugh.

If the director made a few changes this movie would've been great,"The Godzilla vs Kong movie is coming up soon, and in anticipation I'm going to review Kong: Skull Island. This movie blew my mind when I first saw it, but watching it recently, it doesn't hold up. It is a movie that could've been great if there weren't so many flaws that could've been fixed easily.Kong Skull Island has a lot of great actors in the movie. Brie Larson, Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L. Jackson, John C. Reilly and John Goodman star in this film. They are all good in this movie, but they are so bland characters that you can't really rune for. These characters are just people that run away from kong and that's about it. They are blank slates that aren't interesting at all and even if they have good acting, their blandness makes that trait much weaker. There are some very dumb moments that could've been taken out of the film, and some scenes happen and they don't make much sense in terms of how that scene happened. There is also a lot of obvious cgi in the movie and some scenes look very artificial.The action sequences in this movie are very entertaining and are a big redeeming factor in this movie. King Kong looks like a beast in this movie and so do all the other monsters in this movie. The best thing I can say about this movie is that it is watchable and disposable. Dan Gilroy wrote the screenplay for this movie with a bunch of less talented writers, and if it was just Dan Gilroy writing the screenplay for this movie, I'd be okay with that. Middle school Austin really liked this movie, but 9th grade Austin thought this movie was just meh. If they just gave the main characters some backstory with some interest, and if the stupid plot points were removed, this film would've been way more entertaining. I'd give this movie a 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Refreshing entry into the franchise,"Taking place after the Vietnam war Bill Randa & Houston Brooks are scientists who convince the U. S. Government to fund a highly beneficial expedition to the newly discovered Skull Island, one shrouded in mystery. For the dangerous journey they hire an illustrious former Captain James Conrad to lead with Colonel Preston Pickard with a group of American soldiers. Also along for the journey is Mason Weaver an awarded journalist/photographer. Getting to the island proves to be a struggle as the Island is surrounded by a dangerous storm system, but once past that you are welcomed by a beautifully contained ecosystem. Not long after they arrive and begin the journey through the jungle the group learns the danger is more real than expected and they run into more than a few creatures that completely defy logic and basic science. A power struggle ensures and we learn without a shadow of a doubt who is the true King of Skull Island.The wonder and excitement brought back to life for this classic franchise. This film delivered some fantastic unique plot lines making for a truly refreshing entry for Kong/Godzilla fans and just plain movie fans in general. The use of CGI is prevalent yet needed to even make a movie like this work and it looks fantastic, generally in this kind of movie it tries to highlight the action over the dialog but not here. Tip of the top CGI but with the plot and dialog that is just as strong and stacks together beautifully. The cast speaks for itself, already cemented stars in Samuel L & John C, and a few up and coming stars in Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson & Jason Mitchell. All in all its an entertaining ride!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's King Kong - meets Jurassic Park - meets Hacksaw Ridge - meets Any Film With Peculiar Beasts.,"A King Kong theme can never go wrong. However, despite the visual effects - I saw it in 3-D - I never really engaged with any of the characters, apart from the Richard Attenborough-style mad doctor.It is a familiar pattern of one action scene after another. Whilst this may enthrall young audiences, I actually found it quite boring and over-long.In all, it was King Kong - meets Jurassic Park - meets Hacksaw Ridge - meets Any Film With Peculiar Beasts.I scored it seven as I LOVE King Kong, and the concept of a primitive olde-worlde island covered in the skulls of prehistoric monsters appeals to me greatly. The primitive tribe is an excellent example of costume and makeup. The beautiful Japanese girl should have had more of a leading role than having to play support to the tired female-in-distress wearing the skimpiest clothing in the lookalike style of Laura Dern.It's a rehash of all the Kong films you ever saw. Storyline could have been better. Soundtrack is a 70's style 'Good Morning Veitnam'.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good popcorn Cinema,"Cool, neat, stylish, but not much more. It certainly fell a bit short, specially considering the source material it had to work upon. Visually it is quite interesting, though sometimes a bit oversaturated in colour. With that said, half of its scenes were a bit overdone and overstylized and its no good. I mean, most of the characters scenes seemed like this - ""Oh, we're cool, lets make badass poses to the slow-mo"". And its just that, for almost two hours. To make it justice, it does feauture an awesome soundtrack - but its the 70s, how could they go wrong? . Its a fun decent blockbuster but it ends there. Kong was the great attraction of it - they didn't hide him, just put him in the open and that was a very good decision. The mega-fights are also quite entertaining and give you a big sense of scale and intensity.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Colonizing Cameras,"By and large, ""Kong: Skull Island"" does a fair job at realizing what the King Kong franchise got right in the first place in 1933. The people who enter Skull Island are colonialists and cinematography and photography are among their weapons, while Kong is the visual-effects marvel of a monster-as-movie to be captured and released back upon the ""civilized"" world. In this case, he's but one American movie among an entire legion of Japanese kaiju in the so-called Monsterverse. The after-credits scene actually works well in this regard.Quite the cross-fertilization the Monsterverse has with the template cinematic universe of the MCU, what with borrowing Tom Hiddleston and Samuel L. Jackson, as well as John C. Reilly, I guess, and returning them afterwards with interest in the form of Brie Larson. And, this is on top of the would-be Maximoff twins making out in the first Monsterverse entry, ""Godzilla"" (2014). Even compared to Loki, Fury and Captain Marvel, though, their characters here are thin. An amoral mercenary, a warmonger commander, an ""anti-war"" photojournalist and some obsessed monster hunters, OK and what else is there to flesh them out as characters? Oh, that's it. Only Reilly holds some interest as to what will happen to him, providing both the picture's comic relief and, besides the giant ape created in computers, the emotional center that one might've thought would be occupied by Hiddleston and Larson, but they'd be wrong. Meanwhile, Jackson goes superficial ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979) levels of insane, while other familiar faces, like John Goodman or Richard Jenkins, are wasted.Other than a bunch of CGI fighting, including some quite good shots of Kong's confrontation with the helicopters, the filmmakers did well to have a couple of their characters equipped with cinematographic and photographic cameras--making them the on-screen surrogate filmmakers in addition to being hollow characters. Unlike the 1933 original, we don't get the surrogate spectators of New York being attacked by the monster from the stage, although there's a reference to Kong's being chained before that here. At least, as all the dialogue makes very clear, the picture acknowledges its metaphor of Vietnam War type imperialist folly and in Kong's eternal battle with the lizards the ecological importance of predators. And, on that last account, is the main fantasy of these giant monster movies: that people may be held in check by not being the apex predator. Kong is just a movie, though--he doesn't exist, but there are plenty of Colonel Packards to go around letting loose skull crawlers, or whatever you want to call it.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Kong: Skull Island - Pretty People Running from Scary Monsters,"Last week, I finally sat down to watch Kong: Skull Island - a two-hour ride with a lot of cool monsters and a lot of missed opportunities.Screen Crush tells us that there have been seven King Kong movies (not counting the rip-offs), making Kong: Skull Island the eighth installment in the franchise. There are elements in this movie that are universal to all King Kong movies, but it still manages to stand on its own in this very diverse (at least quality-wise) franchise.Directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts, Kong: Skull Island stars Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson. In supporting roles we see Samuel L. Jackson, John C. Riley, John Goodman, as well as many, many others.In this re-telling of the King Kong story, the expedition to Skull Island is led by a government agent Bill Randa, played by John Goodman. The official objective is to prove the so-called Hollow Earth theory, but what Randa actually wants is to prove the existence of monsters that once ruled the Earth.Randa, together with seismologist Houston Brooks and biologist San Lin, recruits an expert tracker James Conrad, played by the de-Lokified Tom Hiddleston.Since this is a government operation, the team is escorted by Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard, played by Sam Jackson who's giving a wonderfully over-the-top performance. Preston and his men are about to end their tour in Vietnam, but Preston is more than happy to go on one last mission, much to the rest of the soldiers' chagrin.The last to join this ragtag team of lovable misfits is Brie Larson's anti-war photographer Mason Weaver. Just like Randa, Weaver keeps her true intentions to herself, as she believes this expedition to be a covert military operation, one she is set on exposing.They arrive at Skull Island, marvelling at the untamed beauty of it, but when they drop the explosives to map out the island, the explosions attract King Kong himself. He kills most of the team, with survivors getting split in two groups, separated by square miles of hostile jungle, and now we have our movie.Kong: Skull Island takes place in 1973. The decision to make this movie a period piece had to with the film's place in the Monster Universe that Legendary Pictures set up with 2014's Godzilla. Studio decisions aside, this could have been a thematic decision as well.1973 is the end of an era; a time of great disillusionment in the US. The times are unstable; the general mood is one of war-weariness and disappointment, and our characters are supposed to reflect this collective state of mind.Sam Jackson's character is by far the best one to capture this disillusionment. Jackson describes him as Ahab, and the similarities are everything but subtle. He is the Ahab of this movie, but his quest for revenge against Kong is very-well motivated. He is a soldier who's about to go home for good. His war is over, and he plunges into this new mission head-first, desperate to give his life meaning again. It's his own selfish desires that get his men killed. So, here you have a good conflict, a good way to drive an already unstable character off the deep end. He sees Kong as the enemy and treats the expedition as a military operation.I wish the other members of this star-studded team were as fun to watch as Sam Jackson, which is a real bummer, considering the talent that has been jammed into this flick. The exception here is John C. Riley, who plays a soldier who's been stranded on Skull Island since WWII. He provides the comedy, and is an overall warm presence in this movie.Tom Hiddleston is insanely attractive as the leading man, and Brie Larson is very beautiful. Their characters have potential, him as the disillusioned former military, and her as the war-weary photo-journalist. I say potential, because initially, their characters were supposed to have more meat on them.For instance, Dan Gilroy, who was one of the screenwriters, wanted Larson's character to be more jaded so that her ""emotional awakening"" after meeting Kong would be a bigger deal. Instead, she starts off as a righteous anti-war journalist determined to expose the government, and she stays that way until the end. Her emotional connection to Kong doesn't change anything, it just makes her motivation stronger.What I'm trying to say is that there was potential here to go deeper, to have the characters undergo some fundamental changes, but even with the cast as talented as this one, Kong: Skull Island still ends up being a movie about pretty people running from scary monsters.Not that there's anything wrong with that. It's a monster flick - its first priority is to be entertaining. Okay, its first priority is to make money at the box office, which it did, so everyone's a winner.Watching Kong: Skull Island made me think about how little monster movies have changed since 1933 brought us the original King Kong. They have become increasingly more progressive (read: politically correct), and we can't even compare production values and visual effects (though, the '33 Kong still looks pretty dope), but even eighty years later, the core of these movies remains the same: here's a beautiful breeding pair; here are some scary monsters. Now watch them run around for a couple of hours. Why try to change something that works, right?Still, I wish Kong: Skull Island had been more than just an enjoyable treat. Like I said, the potential was there. Take San Lin, played by actress Jing Tian, for instance. Initially, she was going to have more screen-time and be a - how should I put it? - a real person. I don't know who's idea it was to cut her role down to just a couple of lines of dialogue, but it's this kind of decisions that make the difference between a great movie and a movie that's just entertaining.John Gatins, writer of the second draft of the script cited Apocalypse Now as a major inspiration for Kong: Skull Island, and it shows. This movie borrows heavily not just from Apocalypse Now but from other war movies, like Platoon, so much so that at times Kong: Skull Island looks more like a war movie than an adventure movie.But the main parallel you can draw between this monster movie and the war movies it was inspired by is the general idea of the heroes venturing into the unknown land to smite the enemy only to realize that the situation is far more complicated.Despite its many, many flaws, Kong: Skull Island is a very fun movie. It's a very kind-hearted movie with some very positive themes. There is an anti-war sentiment; but the movie also rests on a general idea that people are good. There is a nice scene at the indigenous people's village where Larson takes pictures of these people and bonds with them. It's supposed to be a growing moment for her character and maybe it's a little manipulative. Still, it's a warm little scene and the movie is better for it.So, these were my two cents on Kong: Skull Island. I'm glad I watched this movie, but I'm also glad I didn't have to pay full price for it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Solid Creature Feature,"This movie is not nearly as good as Peter Jacksons King Kong back in 2005, but it is also a very enjoyable one. The writer does not give really a damn about the story and the characters. So the ambition of this movie is only to make a very quickly cutted action movie.Comparde to the Godzilla 2014, this movie is much better, beaucse it is a king kong movie. The film is about Kong and so he has much more screentime than Godzilla back in 2014. The action scenes have really good CGI, are very entertaining and good directed. Unfortunately you really see that there are a lot of scenes cut off. So suddenly characters appear that you have not seen in this movie until yet. The tone also changes suddenly to fast. For example, when they arive in the Skull island, you hear paranoid from black sabbath and the suddenly kong appears and you have really dramatic music. The next problem is, that Brie Larson's character has not got a personality. The only two characters that are interestingly written are Samuel l jackson's and John C. Reilly's characters, although John C. Reilly's character has also some needless comic relief scenes. All in all the pacing of this movie is great and despite of the weak plot, it is enjoyable.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Why fly so low around Kong when all he's doing is swatting you like flies? How did you get that many helicopters on that small of a ship?

Rating: C,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)After a pleasant revisit to Godzilla (2014), now comes the time for Kong: Skull Island, the second installment in Warner Bros. And Legendary's shared cinematic universe. I watched this film at its original release date and never saw it again. Not because I deeply disliked it or anything of that level, but I never felt a strong desire to rewatch it. I remember feeling indifferent towards the movie since it didn't really surprise me in any aspect. If there's one thing no one can complain about MonsterVerse, it's the jaw-dropping visuals that would evolve beyond the wildest expectations as years went by, but even these didn't blow me away completely in this film. Nevertheless, a small part of me had high hopes for this rewatch...The screenplays of these first two movies are pretty similar concerning their narrative structure. Naturally, most of the runtime is spent with human characters who, in this case, wander around an uncharted land supposedly to perform geologic studies. This time, more monsters are displayed on-screen besides Kong and his main adversary, leading to more action sequences, most in broad daylight, which is a major plus. Basically, any viewer is able to follow every fight, even the ones that happen at night since they're beautifully shot by Larry Fong (DP), who uses fire as a lighting device to produce some wallpaper-worthy images. Kong looks incredible, and the monster fights are utterly riveting.The monsters' visuals hold up strong for most of the runtime, except when humans get involved. Despite a fantastic scene between Kong and Samuel L. Jackson's character, some of the humans vs. Monsters sequences are way too weird. Several feature too noticeable green screen, mixing humans and monsters in close proximity, which didn't work as seamlessly as intended. Still, viewers who complained about the lack of Godzilla in his own flick will be more satisfied not only with the increase of action sequences but also with the main monster's sightings. Kong is a visible, powerful presence throughout the film, and Jordan Vogt-Roberts used him right when the movie needed the big monkey the most.However, the characters are so hollow, cliche, insignificant, and underdeveloped that the time spent with them is much heavier than in the previous film, which is by far, the biggest problem with this movie. It's true that Godzilla doesn't deliver a perfect balance between humans and monsters, but at least the former group feels like such. From clear motivations to well-defined personalities, the protagonists are quite compelling and captivating, making the third act reach greater levels of excitement and overall impact. The short period of monsters fighting each other is so efficient and feels so good that viewers left the theaters demanding more, but this feeling only arose due to the time spent with the human characters that offered bigger stakes to the last act.Vogt-Roberts' film features a great cast, no doubt about it, but only John C. Reilly's character gets a decent arc. Therefore, despite spending more time with humans and seeing fewer monsters in Godzilla, Kong: Skull Island feels slower and lazier (so many unnecessary exposition dumps), ultimately transforming the higher amount of action less impactful. In addition to this, a couple of likable characters meet their end in an extremely underwhelming, embarrassingly illogical manner, which always leaves me a bit annoyed. I wish the screenwriters delved more into Kong's story through other methods besides generic exposition, but at least they keep the ""balance of nature"" overarching narrative from the cinematic universe.Technically, I already applauded the visuals above, but I'll do it again. Kong truly is a beauty of a monster. Any wide shots of him standing up are outstanding, but the one with the sunset in the background is a gorgeous painting on the screen. Henry Jackman's score is definitely exciting, possessing a memorable Kong's theme music. Tom Hiddleston (Thor films, Avengers: Infinity War) and Brie Larson (Captain Marvel, Avengers: Endgame) make a good duo, but John C. Reilly (The Lobster, Tale of Tales) steals the spotlight. The editing (Richard Pearson) could be a lot better, but overall, it's a well-produced blockbuster, as expected.Kong: Skull Island doesn't reach the level of the previous MonsterVerse's installment, but it's far from being a massive disappointment. Jordan Vogt-Roberts' sophomore movie follows a similar narrative structure to Godzilla, just with more action sequences (visible and in daylight), more monsters, and a visually stunning Kong. However, most of the runtime stills belong to the humans who, unfortunately, are nowhere near to being as compelling as in the previous film. Except for John C. Reilly's character, everyone else is incredibly hollow, annoyingly cliche, and significantly underdeveloped, making the time spent with them quite heavy. The excessive reliance on lazy exposition scenes also drags the movie, ultimately turning the monster battles less satisfying. Some narrative decisions concerning certain characters are questionable, to say the least, but overall, I believe it still offers what viewers are looking for. Huge praise to Larry Fong's beautiful cinematography and Henry Jackman's addictive score.Rating: C+",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Truer to the Spirit of the Original King Kong Than Any Other Movie Featuring the Giant Ape,"The original 1933 King Kong is remembered as one of the all time great movies because it had revolutionary special effects, it introduced one of the most iconic fictional characters ever conceived, and it came out of the golden age of American cinema. But at its heart King Kong is a popcorn movie. The characters are two dimensional at best, only existing to move the plot forward, the dialogue is corny and the movie is nonstop monster action once the big monkey comes tearing out of the jungle. In that vein Kong: Skull Island is the true successor to the 1933 original.Dino De Laurentiis's 1976 remake was a drab and cynical attempt to recreate the original with modern themes of corporate greed, Peter Jackson's version was a mythologized, larger than life fantasy film, and the Japanese Kong movies are so far from Merian C. Cooper's original vision that they occupy their own unique space in giant monster history. Kong: Skull Island works in the same way that the original works. It has a fast paced plot that serves to get us to the monster action as quickly as possible, it has simple but functional (and well acted) characters that serve the same purpose, and once Kong is introduced it is a nonstop action thrill ride featuring, like the original, many violent and creative ways to kill off nameless human characters.It has a truly striking visual style that looks like a graphic novel come to life, and it borrows its warm orange and green color palette from Apocalypse Now. Kong: Skull Island is probably the best movie to come out of the Legendary Monster Universe. I bumped up my rating to a 9 after watching the Blu Ray version, which somehow looks even better than I remember it looking in the theater.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Kong: Skull Island is simply a mindless effects-driven popcorn blockbuster.,"All the mythos from 'King Kong', the setting of 'Apocalypse Now' and the character depth of 'Fifty Shades of Grey'. As part of Legendary's ""Gods & Monsters"" universe, we encounter Kong himself...without the Empire State Building. A group of soldiers, explorers, photographers, geologists, biologists and every other ""ologist"" venture forth to Skull Island. Uncharted territory, unique creatures and full of mysterious enigmas. What do they do? Drop seismic bombs. What the actual flip!? No scientist in their right mind would drop a barrage of bombs to determine the island's activity. It's unfortunate this occurs right at the start, it left a sour taste throughout the entire film. Which is a shame because the action, cinematography, sound effects and pacing were all decent. Watching Kong, in all his CGI glory, wreck through a fleet of helicopters by javelining trees, stomping on soldiers and just generally making a mess felt satisfying. Serves them right! You hurt nature, well...nature is just going to bite back, using a gargantuan primate's teeth. Really adored the cinematography and colour palette, embedding various micro slow motion shots to enhance the action. Green, red, blue...it's extremely colourful and vibrant. Unfortunately though, the characters are lifeless and wasted. I literally did not care for any of them...no wait, John C Reilly's character was likeable. That's about it. Eat them, shoot them, explode them, drown them, stomp on them, slap them onto mountain sides...I don't care. Which, in turn, makes the story all that much boring as well. What I admired about 'Godzilla' was that less is more. We see Kong in the first five minutes so there is no mystery or intrigue. It sounds like I'm being too harsh, I did enjoy this. The visual effects were splendid, action was well filmed and everything looked aesthetically pleasing. As I've said before in various reviews, style without substance does not make a great film. Kong versus Godzilla best be better.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Is That A Monkey? HA!,"For the most part a fun popcorn movie. John C Reilly's character was cool but Samuel Jackson's was dark and disturbing. Not sure what motivated him to kill Kong. Margo Robbie would have made a better girlfriend for Kong. I was rooting for Kong to kill all the dumb humans. Why is it we shoot first and ask questions later?Samuel Jackson's story of Icarus was not exactly true. Icarus' father warns him first of complacency and then of hubris, asking that he fly neither too low nor too high. Looks like mans hubris cost them many lives.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Spectacular visuals but thin storyline,"""Kong: Skull Island,"" directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts, is a visually stunning addition to the King Kong franchise. The film takes place during the Vietnam War era and follows a diverse team of scientists, soldiers, and adventurers who venture to an uncharted island, only to encounter the gigantic Kong and other monstrous creatures.The movie excels in its visual effects and action sequences. Kong is impressively rendered, and the vibrant, lush setting of Skull Island adds to the film's immersive experience. The ensemble cast, including Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, and Samuel L. Jackson, brings energy to the screen, though their characters often feel underdeveloped.Despite its thrilling visuals and action-packed scenes, the storyline of ""Kong: Skull Island"" is somewhat predictable and lacks depth. The plot serves primarily as a vehicle for showcasing monster battles and spectacular set pieces rather than delivering a compelling narrative.Overall, ""Kong: Skull Island"" is a fun, visually impressive film that entertains but falls short in terms of character development and story complexity.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Vietcong: Skull Island,"Jumanji, but for adults! Very good visual affects; feels like an old movie. The soundtrack goes well with it too! I probably would have rated this even higher, but it's probably just not my type of movie. It has the same feel as Rambo, Terminator, Independence Day, etc. There's some great actors in this movie. Definitely feels like it's supposed to take place near Vietnam. The movie also feels like a video game or first person shooter arcade game; there's even a part where the camera was put at the end of one of the guns! And again, the visual effects are so perfect!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Burns Out After The First Quarter,"A great cast plastered on a green screen with no script. Blended with a terrific soundtrack that paints the 1960s, including the famous Bell 212 Twin Huey Helicopter, as a supporting actor. After the first hour,the candles to this cool cake melt all over the icing, leaving you with a poorly edited climax that tastes like wax. What could have been, became a flash in the pan forgettable remake that cannot contest with King Kong 2005.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
dumbed down cinema for adhd patients,"I am a fan of the 1933 King Kong Movie. So every time Hollywood decides to dust the gorilla suit off i find myself on board... full of hope that this won't just be the next ludicrous disaster.Guess what? This latest incarnation might even be worse than the previous one. Kong: Skull Island is a ridiculously bad film despite all the acting talent. Speaking of the actors, the casting in this film felt way off. Like said, these are some of today's better acting talents, but they don't really shine in their dumbed down cartoon character roles.While Kong: Skull Island's CGI isn't all bad i really feel sorry for the hairy big guy who was better off in black and white.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Exuberantly Stupid,"The real story is that Kong: Skull Island cost $185 million to make and raked in, as of this writing, $566.2 million. This is the only metric for ""success"" that concerns the studio, and by this measure the film performed well. But what have the makers given the world? Nothing but trite clichés and utter stupidities. What is lost in the equation is the capacity for narrative film to be idiosyncratic and critical. One might object that a rendition of King Kong on a Skull Island was never intended to provoke thought or be relevant to our social or political lives, to which I say ""exactly!"" This piece of garbage is a grotesque exercise in market speculation, one that vampirically draws upon the talents of very capable technicians, actors, designers, etc. by virtue of its bloated budget alone. The two-fold effect of the film is first the empty distraction it provides to all concerned, and second, as previously mentioned, the all-important revenue generated. This ultra-cynical operation of the corporate/industrial culture machine is rife throughout the box office, Kong: Skull Island is not distinguished along these lines either. In fact, Kong: Skull Island is the epitome of the consolidation and creative bankruptcy of film on this gigantic monetary register.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not Bad for a reboot...,"Don't believe all the negative hype/reviews...I almost did. Surprisingly, this re-make has it's own plot. Happy to see Hollywood cut back on the ""beauty killed the beast"" concept and trying to make a Monster Movie caught up in a romance/love story.Obviously, the military angle had glitches but considering the timeframe was close to Vietnam, maybe the battle strategies weren't robust. Plus the military leader had an ego issue which could be par for the times? Finally, Kong had more action scenes then the humans which is a big plus for me! Can see a sequel (Return to Skull Island"" happening and I wouldn't discourage.Enjoy it for what it is.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Exactly what you'd expect and thats a good thing,"Last week I wrote a review of Logan after seeing that masterpiece and commented how it was not a superhero film like others. Going into Kong:Skull Island you would expect to see a film of giant legendary monsters causing havoc with the human cast and having a ruckus between themselves. This is exactly what you get and it's all the better for it.People will go to this film wanting to see a superbly rendered CGI gigantic ape swatting helicopters, hurling and treading on minor characters and going hand-to-hand, teeth-to-teeth with other giant mutated beasties and you get that in spades. The action is pretty relentless throughout and because the cast if full of character actors rather than stars anyone could be on the menu.Those actors do what they need to in their roles without needing to push their abilities. Jackson, Hiddleston, Larsen, Goodman, Hawkins and the rest are all very capable actors who clearly know that they won't be the reason people pay their money to see this film but strike the exact note their roles require. A special note for John C Reilly though who is the character and performance which lingers longest after the credits have rolled.The film isn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination and if you think about it too much probably won't make a lot of sense, but its a two hour enjoyable monster movie and there's absolutely no harm in that.Oh and one last thing....being of a certain vintage absolutely loved the soundtrack",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It certainly entertains,"The title of this latest movie to feature cinema's most famous giant ape, King Kong, refers to the beast's misty and unexplored home in Indonesia, or the Pacific Ocean, or the Indian Ocean, depending on which incarnation you happen to be watching. It's a world known to movie fans to be full of prehistoric or unnaturally gigantic monsters, and things are very much the same in Jordan Vogt-Roberts' entertaining big-budget update. Anyone fearing a retread of the story told back in 1933 and never bettered since can relax, as Kong: Skull Island is less interested in exploring the incredibly fragile relationship between man and nature than it is with smashing helicopters to pieces in front of a gorgeous sunset.Both a follow-up to 2014's Godzilla and a build-up to the upcoming smack-down cross-over between two of the big screen's most famous abominations, Kong carries on the tone by making its human characters infinitely less interesting than the big guy we all came to see. Early trailers and posters before the film's release teased a tone akin to the great Vietnam War , especially Apocalypse Now, but there are little similarities other than the famous shot from Coppola's movie of helicopters flying by a setting sun and the 1973 setting. This is big, dumb fun, and little more, but that is by no means a bad thing. Peter Jackson tried earnestly back in 2005 to tell the traditional story with a mixture of heart and spectacle, with mixed results. It climaxed with the ape's relocation to the mainland and his tragic end at the top of the Empire State Building, but here, once government agents/scientists Bill Randa (John Goodman) and Houston Brooks (Corey Hawkins) seal the required funds and hit the island, we never leave.At just shy of 2 hours, Skull Island struggles to handle the unnecessarily expansive cast of characters, and boy are they bland. Tom Hiddleston's British Special Forces captain James Conrad (an obvious nod to Heart of Darkness author Joseph Conrad) is the closest thing we have to a lead, but this is only because he is handsome and warns the others of danger. They are escorted by Samuel L. Jackson's Preston Packard, a Lieutenant Colonel in charge of a helicopter squadron called the Sky Devils whose idea of scientific study is to bomb the s**t out of the island upon arrival. Among the rag-tag bunch of monkey-food soldiers are the grizzled Cole (Shea Whigham), and Jack Chapman (Toby Kebbell, who also performs the motion-capture for Kong), an eager-to-please young buck with a questionable American accent. In a somewhat baffling move, they also invite photojournalist Mason Weaver (Brie Larson) on a mission you would expect the Army to want to keep quiet.At one point, I counted three concurrent story lines. Supporting characters such as John Ortiz's Nieves and Tian Jing's San are played by familiar faces but serve absolutely no purpose, and only John C. Reilly's stranded World War II veteran Hank Marlow brings any heart and soul to the story. Yet, Roberts knows how to make carnage look incredibly cool, and this is the meanest, leanest and biggest Kong to date. Helicopters are torn to shreds, a giant octopus (living in fresh water?) is brutally devoured, and soldiers are swallowed whole - Kong doesn't have time to share a tender moment with a beautiful woman lying in his palm. When the action shifts away from the puny humans and to the titular powerhouse, the film is so damn exciting that you can, for a short time, forgive the film's many misgivings and clichés. It's unlikely that the 1933 original will ever be topped, so it's pleasing that Kong: Skull Island at least makes an attempt to try something a little different. For a B-movie dressed up as an A-movie with only one memorable character who isn't simian, it certainly entertains.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Waste of time and money,What a waste of time this movie is. The only good thing about this movie is J.C. Reily. My money and my time totally wasted. This is one of the worst performance of Mr. Jackson. I highly recommend you NOT to i repeat NOT to waste your hard earned money in this rubbish. Oh so gutted i went to watch this movie.,1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A bit squeamish-inducing but plenty of bang for the buck,"Owing a bit more to the James Cameronesque horror of grotesquely-shaped beasts than to the simplistic awe of a majestic beast, Kong: Skull Island is an effective nail biter. It's not for the squeamish, however.With the genuine shocks of adrenaline and the action geared towards 3-D viewing, Kong: Skull Island feels like a two-hour roller coaster ride but there's an honest attempt at characterization and story.There's a loosely-established mythology that Kong is the last of his kind and protector to a tribe of very indigenous looking people and a necessary balance to the ecosystem from the dangers of a very ugly creature called the skull duggers and yada yada yada. The film's need for moral parable is precipitated by the fact that Samuel L Jackson (who normally plays such level-headed characters) plays a military commander who's attitudes towards animals are evil with a capital ""E"" which sets up the main narrative conflict of the film, prompting the need for the good guys to step in and rescue Kong from animal cruelty. Perhaps, it's because of the Vietnam setting that the film has an anti-military stance as Jackson's character represents militarism run amok.Chief among the good guys is a castaway played by John C. Rielly who is both a throwback to 50's B-movies (other reviews liken him to ""Apocalypse Now"") and an endearing character in his own right as a castaway who has been stranded on Kong Island for nearly three decades. Brie Larson makes her first big post-Oscar move in style as a Ripley-esque action heroine and Thomas Hiddlestone proves that this guy has a future as a leading man (piggybacking on his great performance in the in ""Night Manager"").""Kong: Skull Island"" is beautifully shot and highly entertaining provided you can stomach it.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"There is another King, and his name is Kong","In the 2nd film of the MonsterVerse, we head to a mythical island filled with mysteries the world has yet to see, and one of those mysteries comes in the form of Kong.First off, the best parts of this film is easily the creature design for Kong himself. He is pretty very sparingly used in this film all things considered. But unlike his Giant Lizard counterpart, we actually get to see him much more clearly. There are several really well taken shots of him in this movie. Plus, the way that he is animated in this movie is really well done. There are a few moments in this film where we get to see more of his humanity come through. And of course, the ape level of action is pretty cool to watch, especially at the end.There were several action scenes in this movie, but most of them aren't because of Kong. Some of the survival action scenes because of the Island were done pretty well. The storytelling, and personality of Skull Island comes through in this movie fairly well. The cinematography of the Island is shot really well.But of course, the downside once again in these movies comes to us courtesy of the uncompelling human character stories. I will say that comparatively to the last movie, the human characters were not as flat thankfully. Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, Sam Jackson, and especially John C. Reily made this movie a lot more interesting character wise. They played there Respective characters well, and led the movie just fine. Do I think they could've been given so much more to do, YES. But regardless, they were good.Overall, I do think this movie is a better movie than 2014's Godzilla. As much as I wanted to like this, I think it's fair to put this as a film that is better than ok. But nowhere near the greatness that it could've been.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Mixed bag,Kong feels like 3 or 4 movies stitched together badly. Actors seem to be photo shopped into a b grade 50s potboiler. Whilst the skull crawlers are terrific there is clunky humour set against very gruesome splat. The inhabitants of the island need more development and the film concludes in a rush.,2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Kong is back, but that's about it..","King Kong is one of the most recognizable monsters of all time, and Kong: Skull Island definitely brings him back to his throne. If you want to see the most cinematically impressive Kong to date then this is your movie, but if you want anything more story wise you might be a bit let down. The 1933 Kong is a cinematic masterpiece, and the 1976 remake is good in its own right. The 2005 Peter Jackson version was a solid representation of Kong using the newest technology and effects, but still staying relativity true to the story. Understanding that Kong: Skull island is not a remake, but a reboot for future Legendary Pictures monster brawls will help some story confusion. This is not the same Kong as those previous, and it does not follow the old story lines.Kong: Skull Island's story had a good amount of promise, the problem is the script and characters did not fit. Samuel L. Jackson and John Goodman have their usual screen presence, but the characters they are portraying are not ones we as the audience generally care about. None of the other characters are worth much either, besides being food for the many monstrous residents of Skull Island.This version of Kong however is impressive. Easily the most destructive, aggressive, and largest Kong to date. When Kong is on the screen the movie is awesome. Great visual effects and camera angles really give the action some impact. Kong is what holds this movie together and makes it at least a decent entry into the franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
