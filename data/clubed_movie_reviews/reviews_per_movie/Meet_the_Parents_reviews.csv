Great comedy,"Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) is a male nurse, poised to propose to the woman he loves, Pam (Teri Polo) but the right thing to do would be to ask her father's permission first. During a weekend of getting to know them, he manages to make a strong impression; for all the wrong reasons. Her father (Robert De Niro) isn't quite what Greg has been led to believe, and right from the start he seems to have it in for his daughter's partner.De Niro and Stiller play off each other brilliantly, and both of them give fine comic performances, with a surprising level of depth for comedy characters. This film is packed with slick gags, hilarious scenes and it has a really fun story; it's a comedy film that you don't want to miss.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
If you hate cats Robert De Niro will kick your butt,"I know I'm late to the party, but probably so are you if you're reading reviews at this late date. ""Meet the Parents"" is a funny flick that hearkens back to the glorious late-80s, or maybe even earlier, when comedies weren't so preoccupied with shocking the audience with gross out gags or surprise twists. Most of this movie is wonderfully predictable, and aside from a few deliberately clumsy drug references and maybe a sexual innuendo or two, it was good clean fun from start to finish.Most of all, I'd say it's a good date flick to prepare yourself for the inevitable agony of meeting your own boyfriend/girlfriend's parents. We all know it sucks. (If you don't think so, oh, just you wait. Sometimes it takes years for them to expose themselves as the hideous flesh eating monsters that they are.) De Niro manages to take us to the utter extreme of monster but without shattering our suspension of disbelief. This is a key point. If the situation were to become too absurd , we would lose focus on the story and instead hone in on the individual gags. While there are plenty of funny gags to go round, they are really just dressing on an already funny premise: the story of an underdog who just cannot fit in to a judgmental bourgeois family no matter how hard (and usually because of how hard) he tries.Ben Stiller shows his acting diversity (while on a different movie set playing the terminally airheaded Zoolander) as a dorky protagonist whose best intentions are always poorly timed or received completely the wrong way.The antagonists, in this case, everybody else in the movie, tread the fine line of comedy and irritation. That is, at any time you could find yourself laughing or hating them. What's masterfully done is the filmmaker's (and of course actors') ability to turn you on a dime, take you to the edge of wanting to kill someone but then having a hearty laugh at their antics. Like I said earlier, Robert De Niro is the anchor that makes this possible, and any casting short of him (well, or maybe Christopher Walken) would have resulted in the film falling apart due to the demands it puts on our willingness to accept a complete jerk like the character he plays. Really his only redeeming quality is that he likes cats. But that's the point, I guess. No matter how rude a person may seem, there's always something redeeming in there.Well, maybe except for the hilariously loathsome airline attendant who appears in a short but pivotal role at the film's climax. To me, that scene was worth the price of admission.Don't think twice, this is a movie worth seeing. Other similar films focusing on severely dysfunctional families trying to act normally include De Niro & Billy Crystal in ""Analyze This"", a great Andy Garcia movie called ""City Island"" and--this may be a stretch but--I think fans of ""Meet the Parents"" would really enjoy the original British ""Death at a Funeral"" (2007). Ya just gotta love comedies about trying to be normal in an utterly abnormal situation.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"One of the funniest comedies of the year, De Niro and Stiller make the perfect comedy pair. *** (out of four)","MEET THE PARENTS / (2000) *** (out of four)By Blake French:The main character in ""Meet The Parents"" is a Chicago-based male nurse, Greg Focker (pronounced just how it is spelled) who realizes how unlucky a person can be. He is about to propose to his schoolteacher girlfriend, Pam (Teri Polo), when her sister Debbie (Nicole Dehuff) calls and explains that her new fiancé, Dr. Bob Banks (Tom McCarthy), received a blessing from her father before he asked the question. This information makes Greg reconsider his method of choice, and instead jumps at the opportunity to meet Pam's overprotective parents when they fly to the east coast two weeks later to arrange Debbie's wedding.At the airport, the attendants loose Greg's parcels. Thus he arrives without any luggage. Once at Pam's parent's house, they exchange greetings and aquatint themselves with each other. Pam's parents, Jack and Dina Byrnes (Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner) learn about Greg's unusual last name, that he does not like cats, and is a male nurse, all facts that do not settle well with Pam's father. Greg does manage to gift Jack with a pleasant supply of rare flowers. However, even though Pam explained to Greg  that her dad is in the hobby of rare flowers, he does not seem too impressed.Even More complications ensue, especially when Greg learns of Jack's peculiar behaviors and suspicious gadgets, such as a polygraph and hidden cameras placed in every room of the house, as well as meeting Pam's brother, Denny (Jon Abrahams), and Debbie's soon to be in laws, Larry (James Rebhorn), and Linda Banks (Phillis George), and Pam's wealthy ex-fiancée, Kevin Rawley (Owen Wilson). Soon, Greg's chances of receiving Jack's permission to wed his daughter become less and less probable as his bad luck only manages to increase.The film introduces Greg and Pam with silly quirks that come up later in the story. Pam's parents are also quite the treat; the movie does not go over the top but portrays them with serious humor and charismatic wit. It is De Niro and Stiller who make the movie, however. They form an very effective comedic chemistry, even more amusing than the likable shtick between De Niro and Billy Crystal in ""Analyze This."" The filmmakers take advantage of the phenomenal tension between Greg and Jack, and place them in one hilarious situation after another.While outrageous and at times explosively funny, director Jay Roach takes the plot seriously. His previous films, including the Austin Powers films and ""Mystery, Alaska,"" have had trouble with taking anything seriously. But ""Meet The Parents"" has emotional connections, develops solid empathy for Greg, and we really believe he has something precious that can be lost: Pam.The movie does not completely develop romantic chemistry between Ben Stiller and Teri Polo, thus there were times when I simply did not believe the two were really in love. The relationship sometimes feels trite and contrived. There are also important plot nuggets left only partially examined: Jack's pot-head son, who could have contributed a lot more to the drug related material, is left as a plot device to provide another string of conflicts within Jack and Greg.I really enjoyed the whimsical performances and opportune casting. Ben Stiller reprises his ""There's Something About Mary"" role, with cute charm and the obscured zany flippancy. Robert De Niro is perfect in a role he was born to play, with serious attitude that results in the main portion of the film's funny moments. Blythe Danner is also charming in a kind of role that is becoming all too usual for her.""Meet the Parents"" is one of the funniest movies of the year. It gives audiences with a solid story that does not interfere with the comic material, but contributes to it. The top notch performances and lively direction also raise the film to a higher level. During a year in which effective comedies are an endangered species, ""Meet The Parents"" is a landmark achievement in light entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Painfully funny,"Most of the funny moments in 'Meet the Parents' involve painful scenes with Ben Stiller. He plays Greg Focker, a male nurse who loves Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo). He wants to marry her with her father's permission. He hasn't met her parents yet. The movie shows us the weekend where Stiller meets the parents. Pam's father is Jack (Robert De Niro) and her mother is Dina (Blythe Danner). The more Greg tries to impress the parents, especially Jack who is a former CIA-agent, the more he humiliates himself. Not only with his actions, also with his words and stupid lies to look better.Stiller is perfect in this kind of role. We already saw that, especially in 'There's Something About Mary'. The more he gets in trouble, the more painful it gets, the better Stiller gets and the more we laugh. There is also a fine little part from Owen Wilson as Pam's former lover. Stiller and Wilson have made a lot of films together and for some reason their scenes always work, they at least make you smile. De Niro doesn't try very hard to be a strict person who doesn't give Greg a chance and therefore succeeds even better. The way he slowly gets harder and harder on Greg is good for a new laugh every time. 'Meet the Parents', directed by Jay Roach who also directed the 'Austin Powers' trilogy, is a fine comedy with a lot of sequences where you might feel a little uncomfortable.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
a truly marvelous comedy,"Funny as well as touching, `Meet the Parents' blazes forth as one of the outstanding comedies of recent years.Co-writers Greg Glienna and Mary Ruth Clarke, along with director Jay Roach, have managed to make a film that is often laugh-out-loud hilarious without ever becoming overbearing or obnoxious, the style of choice for far too many other comedies made in this day and age.  Although the film overflows with madcap situations and even outright slapstick at times, these comic elements are always tethered to the reality of the premise and to the emotional states of the characters involved.The foundation for any great comedy must, first and foremost, be its ability to connect with its audience on a personal level.  `Meet the Parents' does so from the very start by tapping into the universal dilemma we all face at one time or another of desperately trying to make a good impression on someone we feel holds nothing less than the fate of our lives in their own two hands.  For some of us this person might come in the form a boss or a potential employer or, as in poor Greg Focker's case, those most dreaded figures of all  the prospective in-laws.  The comedy arises from seeing the chain of ever more preposterous events and circumstances that come along to sabotage his efforts.  Greg is a goodhearted, well-meaning nebbish who wants nothing more out of life than to marry Pam, the girl he loves.  First, however, he must climb over the rather formidable barrier of her eccentric father, Jack Byrnes, played to perfection by Robert De Niro, who certainly has his own offbeat way of looking at the world.The triumph of this film is that it never overdoes anything.  The people in Pam's family and in their coterie of friends are all twisted it's true, but twisted in sly, subtle ways that knock both Greg and us slightly off our balance.  Like Greg, we never quite know where these people are coming from and this greatly enhances the comedic quality of the film.  Tone is everything in comedy and here the tone is just right.  Byrnes can seem at one moment to be a reasonable loving father, then turn immediately around and make the most unbalanced comments about the most trivial matters.  Even when the movie is at its most outrageous in terms of plot complications and slapstick, it never veers off the scale into incredibility.  Part of the reason is that we feel so much empathy for Greg, the best Everyman character I have seen in a movie in a long time.  Ben Stiller gives a beautifully understated comic performance in the main role.  Greg's completely understandable feelings of nervousness, intimidation and growing frustration help to keep the film anchored in reality, even as the story threatens to spiral off into undisciplined absurdity.  Luckily, the filmmakers never let this happen.  They are also blessed with the genius of Mr. De Niro, who never makes a false move as the seemingly crazy ex-CIA agent who may or may not be harboring a few secrets of his own. Above all, De Niro never lets us bank on the extent of his character's eccentricity, which brilliantly enhances this `weekend from hell' scenario.   For crazy and maddening as he can be at times, we can't help loving this character.Finally, unlike in many other romantic dramas and comedies, the relationship between the young couple in this film is both believable and touching.  Greg and Pam are so likable - and the odds against them seem so staggering - that we find ourselves rooting them on from first moment to last.  Their moments together are genuinely touching at times, particularly in the film's closing stretches.Kudos go out to everyone involved for making `Meet the Parents' one of the slyest, wittiest and flat-out funniest movies to come our way in a long, long time.",,Anonymous,Romance
A comedy with Stiller at his most awkwardly best,"Rating-7/10Meet the Parents is a comedy and almost kind of romance movie that boats a stellar cast and some funny lines. The humour here is spread out well and the laughs don't just all come in one scene or the other, it makes you laugh at the end and the beginning too. I think the majority of the laughs are more physical than what they say, but what I will add is that when Greg(Ben Stiller) says certain lines, they come off brilliantly. I felt it was just about good and here below is why.The cast here seem excellent and Ben Stiller as I mentioned is cast well in the lead role as Greg, his physical humour matches up to his line delivery and both combine very well. Robert De Niro as the father in law Jack is great as well, he somehow seems to mix serious but still feel funny and all credit to him on this one. Teri Polo as Pam, Greg's finance, is well cast and so even is Blythe Danner including people like Owen Wilson too to create a first rate bunch of characters.It's written well, now what I will say is that the script doesn't quite produce as memorable scenes as some of the more physical jokes do but there still funny anyway. John Hamburg and Jim Herzfeld do a good job as I say writing this and both seem to combine past experiences well, with Hamburg who worked with Stiller on ""Zoolander"" yet again bringing out the laughs and the type of humour we have come to expect.I think the director Jay Roach is probably the best thing in a way about this, yes you may say how is it not Stiller, but Roach is the master here when it comes to the most memorable parts, and a lot of the laughs. Roach seems to be able to not only get good delivery, but make things very awkward, and part of you even feels awkward watching it at times.Now Meet the Parents isn't the funniest film you will ever see, if it is then there is much else out you need to see, but it does stand tall when it comes to comedy, and laughs can be had a plenty everywhere. I think although it is a typical comedy type plot, the jokes and the cast involved+ some memorable scenes create a movie that is new when it comes to jokes and even maybe creates a new type of Rom-Com.On the jokes side again, pretty much any scene where it goes wrong for Greg is funny, whether he is hurt, hurts somebody or basically does something to destroy something, It makes not only Stiller's reactions funnier, but also how the cast react, just hilarious on that side of things. I also think how De Niro goes from actually kind of nice to angry in a matter of seconds is perfect, top class acting from the great.So overall I think this is a good movie, just scraping into being good but still a good one. I think the reason it isn't great is that it isn't smart ENOUGH, it is smart but there could have been some better jokes or maybe even this type of plot just only works to a certain point. Nevertheless I can't recommend this more, whether you like Ben Stiller, Robert De Niro or any of the cast involved, your sure to have a great time and laugh a lot along the way.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Love it! Can watch it over and over again.,"Haha this is one of those comedies that you will always remember. Full of classic lines that my wife and I constantly use on daily bases, like ""if it has teat then you can milk it, puff the magical dragon, the circle of trust and so on..."" Meet The Parents is full of those phrases that makes me laugh every time I think about it. And that's what defines a good comedy to me. If I watch a comedy I want to laugh and with this one it's what you get. Some people might not like it but then to me they just don't have a sense of humor and that's just a pity for them. You have to like Ben Stiller though because it's basically him that is the great comedian of the movie. If you don't like him you probably not going to like the movie either. Like I don't like the movies with Adam Sandler. I think that guy is not funny and so his comedies are painful to watch for me. In Meet The Parents the whole story is basically about the relation between Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro. Robert De Niro that plays his role brilliantly as well by the way. The other actors are good as well but it's not them that carry the movie. To me it's already a classic movie when I think about the best comedies I ever saw.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very funny - but the real strength of the film is being able to relate to the characters,"Our story begins when a male nurse named Greg Focker (Stiller) is about to propose to his girlfriend, Pam (Teri Polo); unfortunately, things come to worst and before Greg can say, ""Will you marry me?"" he finds out that Pam's father, Jack (Robert De Niro) approved of Pam's sister's fiancé because he asked Jack's permission to marry her first. Taken aback, Greg decides to wait until tomorrow, whence they are going to meet Pam's parents, and ask Jack for approval before proposing to Pam. Should be a piece of cake, right? Wrong. Pam's mother (Blythe Danner) is very nice, but herein lies the problem: Not only is it apparent from the start that Pam's plant-expert father is not really a plant-expert (as Greg learns after Jack doesn't seem to recognize a plant Greg gives to him--one of the rarest plants in the world), but it turns out Jack is really in the CIA and was a ""human lie detector,"" as Pam herself puts it. In fact, Jack even gives Greg a lie detector test in one scene to see if he liked the dinner earlier in the evening. ""Yes,"" Greg replies, to see the needle jumping. ""Well, it was a little rare for my tastes, maybe."" Greg, desperately seeking approval (and nervous as ever), seems to unintentionally cause mayhem in his possible parents-to-be's home. Nerves shot like a drug addict, Greg is the definition of a nervous wreck, and all his problems seem to escalate more and more until a funny-if-sappy comedic showdown.You know how sometimes you are really nervous, but try to hide the fact? You seem to keep your cool, until you do something, then all your nervousness explodes and you start knocking over things, saying stupid things--single-handedly DOING stupid things that you just never do? And then you look around and everyone is looking at you like you are some sort of freak? Well, that's how it is with Greg's character in ""Meet the Parents""--he is so easy to identify with. Just like all of us, we want to keep our cool and impress people--but once we lose it, the coolness seems to slip farther and farther away from our grip until we are klutzes on feet. For Greg's character, small things turn bigger and bigger and bigger--from knocking over the remains of Jack's mother (and having a cat go to the bathroom on the remains), to setting the house on fire and busting the septic tank. Situations seem to escalate farther and farther out of control and they just keep getting worse and worse.In one scene, Greg tries to impress everyone while playing volleyball in a pool. His team is losing because of him. ""Get up and hit the ball,"" Jack says to him. So the next time the ball comes around to Greg, he jumps up and smacks the ball with all his might, sending it flying towards...Pam's sister (whose wedding is the next day), shattering her nose. Greg lands back in the pool and seems to be happy, until he realizes he smacked his sister-in-law-to-be in the nose. Then everyone looks at him like he's an insensitive idiot.Things like that have happened to me countless times, and that is why I can so easily identify with Greg. People are yelling at Greg to do something, and when he finally does it, it backfires and everyone looks at him like he's stupid, even though he did exactly what he was told.That's the kind of thing that makes this movie so great--not only is it extremely funny, but we can easily identify with the main character countless times throughout the film. That is, perhaps, the best thing about this comedy.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
De Niro The Comedian,"Odd to state that ""Robert De Niro is the star of this comedy,"" but that's the case here. One doesn't normally associate him with comedy, but he's a pretty versatile actor, and can play a lot more characters than Mafia-type thugs. He's also a pretty darned good comedian, as he first proved way back in the early '80s with Rupert Pupkin in ""The King of Comedy.""Anyway, De Niro and Ben Stiller provide a lot of laughs in this modern-day comedy. No sense going into detail as there are plenty of other reviews here. I hate to see the ""hero"" of a movie being a character who is chronic liar (Stiller's ""Greg Focker"") but that's not unusual in the world of films. That, and Blythe Danner's excessive use of God's name as exclamations gets annoying.Other than that, it's a fun movie that turned out to be a hit and justifiably so. I imagine you could get a lot of laughs from watching this over and over. That would be better than watching the sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

But this movie's lame premise, a male nurse meeting his 8-month girlfriend's parents, shouldn't warrant a No. 1 movie for many weeks. All the jokes in it are recycled from another better movie.

Brilliant Comic Double Act Elevates Otherwise Average Rom-Com,"Meet the Parents is a fun comedy that thrives on the awkward encounters between Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro. While the movie may not necessarily break new ground, it delivers consistent laughs thanks to the outstanding comedic performances of its two leads.However, the film's heavy reliance on cringe-inducing humour becomes a little repetitive, as it mostly sticks to this particular comedic style. As the story unfolds, the comedy loses some of its freshness, particularly when combined with a predictable romantic comedy plot. Nonetheless, the film manages to succeed, largely due to the incredible chemistry between Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
How unlucky can one man be?,"Meet Gaylord Focker (Ben Stiller), a very genuine but unfortunate guy. Gaylord, better known as Greg, is madly in love with his girlfriend Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo) and wants to marry her.  But before he can win her hand in marriage, he has to win her parents approval; a task which proves to be extremely difficult.Greg and Pam go on their way to meet the parents.  Greg doesn't exactly get off to a very good start when he manages to break the urn that holds the remains of a late relative.  Pam's father Jack (Robert Di Niro) takes an instant dislike to Greg and makes it his business to push Greg to the limit and see just how far he can go to get him as far away from his daughter as possible.The film is full of exceptionally funny moments.  The unfortunate events that unfold and the stupid ways in which Greg tries to cover them up, make this film worth a shot.  Granted, it's not the funniest film out there but it is very good for a laugh and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it.Robert Di Niro proves that he is still one of the most talented actors around, taking on the role of the control freak father and Ben Stiller settles in nicely to yet another role as the geek, trying to win his girl (Something About Mary).",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

A masterclass in awkward comedy,"Meet the Parents is a comedy that revels in awkwardness. It may not have a significant number of belly laughs but it more than makes up for that with some great lines and several sequences so horrifying in their embarrassment that you're left speechless. It's not a mean spirited film though, as there's a warmth that shines through by the end.Ben Stiller is obviously the way into this slightly weird family and the comedy he mines from being a fish out of water is really solid. He's not as typecast as some of his co-stars here often can be however, he definitely has a specific set of skills that overlap with his other work in unobtrusive ways. The main thing is he's dialling it down to the exact level of Stiller this film needs from him.Robert De Niro is so funny. It's a prime example of a serious actor being a natural at comedy by treating all the ridiculous dialogue with the same level of commitment as he would for anything else, and the results are glorious. It's also nice to see him play someone who is just a really nice guy, a caring father and someone who's greatest issue is that they're just overprotective.Jay Roach's direction is really good at escalating the biggest slapstick set pieces. They build and build to their most shocking moment and then know exactly when to end so they don't overstay their welcome. Randy Newman's score weaves in and out of the film, knowing when it's needed and when it's not, ensuring the wholesome centre is never lost in all the chaos.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Overhyped!,"Don't get me wrong; some parts of ""Meet the Parents"" were very funny, but the movie as a whole seemed like a slow train wreck.I was waiting throughout the movie for Ben Stiller to be a man and stand up for himself while all of his girlfriend's family dumped on him.  I think his girlfriend was the most maddening character of all, not taking up for him and basically setting him up for failure.  She also let him sleep late, and wear his pajamas to the breakfast table, when everyone else was dressed and ready to go.  I would have drawn the line at the lie detector test, and walked out of the house, never to see any of that family (including his girlfriend) again.I had heard wonderful things about this movie from almost everyone I know, and to say the least, I was incredibly disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Amusing...somewhat,"Ben Stiller stars in director Jay Roach's MEET THE PARENTS, a somewhat amusing farce about a male nurse named (yes) Greg Focker, who travels with his girlfriend Pam (Teri Polo) to her family home, not only because of Pam's sister's impending nuptials, but also because it will give Greg a chance to meet her parents and ask her father for Pam's hand in marriage. Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner, an onscreen couple you thought you'd never see, are absolutely believable as Pam's folks, especially in their first scene with the younger couple. Unfortunately, this is perhaps the film that has made De Niro into a comedic rather than dramatic actor (THE KING OF COMEDY wasn't meant to be completely amusing), and you'll begin to miss the Bobby of old (TAXI DRIVER, GOODFELLAS, even the action-packed RONIN).I'll admit that I enjoyed this film, but only in a few scenes. Greg's scene with the female ticket agent on the airplane was memorable, as were the scenes where Jack (De Niro), apparently ex-CIA, hooks Greg up to the lie detector, and where Greg does too much to impress the others during a game of water volleyball.What I did love about the film were its subtle touches, especially in the way Greg is treated, because it's happened to me--it's happened to a lot of us. Ever say something that causes other people to look at you and go, ""What the heck are you talking about?"" It's happened to me several times, and it happens to Greg. A lot. That's where the amusement in MEET THE PARENTS lies, and I hope that MEET THE FOCKERS, a sequel due out next year, keeps some of that. 7/10Side issue: the film is apparently based on an earlier (independent) film by screenwriters Greg Glienna and Mary Ruth Clarke. I just hope this film (the 2000 version) wasn't made just to make more $$$ on an older, funnier film. It'd sound too much like a remake that way. Personally, I wouldn't want to see CLERKS remade with hot young stars instead of the New Jersey slackers we grew to love.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Cruel and Unkind,"The very first thing that irritated me about this film was the appalling gag used throughout the film. The man is named Greg (Gaylord) Focker. Although his surname sounds vaguely like a swearword, this is a very thin gag which is the basis of huge chunks of the film. This is the first cruel part of this film.The film is focused towards victimising the main character. Instead of making gags about the mistakes he makes inadvertently, he is forced to make these mistakes. It is so rigid. It seems that all acting and storylines are suspended until the next mistake happens and then the next five minutes is verbal abuse at what best can be described as accidents.It seems that the entire family, including his girlfriend are hoping and praying for him to make a mistake so that they can get rid of him. He tries to impress and help the family. They make no attempt to apologise when they are at fault.Many other reviews focus on the fact that you can identify with the main character, this enables you to laugh at this film. This is the entire problem with this film. The fact that you can identify with the character makes this film even harder to watch. If Ben Stiller hadn't done such a great job at portraying this character then maybe I could stand to laugh. His performance was too good. I put myself in his shoes once too often during this film and was disgusted with the way he is treated.The character is too nice to laugh at. He is true to himself. (His job choice) He cares about other's beliefs. (Asking her father for permission) He is desperate to please and earn the respect and acceptance of his 'new' family.The rest of the cast is exposed to be cruel and nasty at various points in the film. How can people dare to laugh at the nicest and most honest character in this film.Ben Stiller     - 8/10 (For his portrayal)Everything else - 0/10",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Stiller Strikes Again,"It's not entirely clear why Ben Stiller continues to get work and acclaim for his performances, since he really doesn't do much at all. His main role in any given film is to stand there and look dumbfounded as the world falls apart around him. He played one of his most successful versions of this when he played Gaylord Focker. The first time was in ""Meet the Parents"", which was a remake of a little seen independent film. Stiller plays a male nurse, a detail that punctuates several of the running jokes. He goes home with his fiancée for a wedding, at which point Murphy's Law strikes, his patience is tested, and all of that.Robert DeNiro is here too, fresh off his uncharacteristic comic turn in ""Analyze This"". He plays the fiancée's overbearing, ultra-critical, highly suspicious father. It's a role that was originally slated for Christopher Walken, who would have ruined it with an added sense of creepiness. The main meat of the film comes from the tug-of-war between DeNiro's psychological testing and Stiller's struggle to be heard and accepted. This is a classic formula that works surprisingly well as a modern-day screwball comedy, given the weaknesses in Stiller and his irritating and frequent co-star Owen Wilson.""Meet the Parents"" is a formulaic comedy with a bit of a dark streak. It's a decent movie with some memorable bits, but it's more of a trial to get through than enjoyable which is something ironed out in time for the sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

funny alright but overkill perhaps,"meet the parents is a good comedy, in comparison to some of the recent releases this year. it's about a male nurse (!) trying to get approval from his 10-month girlfriends parents. ben stiller did an excellent job. robert de niro, however, stole the show.the movie has some really funny ones (especially the scene with the stewardess at the end) but a big chunk of the movie revolves around ben stiller's clumsy antics, which gets *dragging* after a point. the vase followed by the cat followed by the flush and the fire... the list goes on with clumsiness almost tending to slapstick. it's a case of too many goofs spoiling the spoof.a good movie on the whole though. i would give it a 7 on 10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Impossible not to laugh...,"""Meet the Parents"" is a hilarious movie which has to do with a male nurse who is getting to know the parents of his girlfriend and there his nightmare begins because her father is a very suspicious man who wants the best for his daughter. Also in this movie watch the difficulties which he has to surpass and how is going to do that.I really liked this movie because it was unpredictable, the plot and story line were equally good. I also liked it because of the interpretation of Ben Stiller who plays as Gaylord 'Greg' Focker (boyfriend of Pam) and I believe that he made one of his best interpretations. Another good interpretations made by Robert De Niro's who plays as Jack Byrnes (suspicious father) and he was simply outstanding, Teri Polo's who plays as Pam Byrnes (daughter of Jack) and of course Owen Wilson who plays as Kevin Rawley an old boyfriend of Pam.Lastly I have to tell you that ""Meet the Parents"" is one of the best comedy and romance movies which is really hilarious and I believe that everyone have to watch it because it's really worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Stiller and DeNiro make good foils for one another in 'Meet the Parents',"Meet the Parents (2000) Robert De Niro, Ben Stiller, Blythe Danner, Teri Polo, Nicole DeHuff, Jon Abrahams, James Rebhorn, Phyllis George, Owen Wilson, D: Jay Roach. A hapless male nurse spends a weekend with her girlfriend's parents during her sister's wedding, hoping to ask her uptight father, an ex-CIA agent, for her hand in marriage . . . but he's intimidated by her dad along with being caught in many errors to ruin his chances. There's rarely a humorless moment in this entertaining comedy, where the situation leaves for plenty of funny moments and maintains a satisfying comedic momentum. With great chemistry, Stiller works well as a comic foil to De Niro, who plays it straight but still gives off a hilarious comedy performance without being too serious.

Well? Could you?,"The moment in which 'Meet The Parents (2000)' solidifies itself as an exemplary entry in the genre is the very same in which De Niro's tight-lipped, ex-CIA retiree asks his soon-to-be son-in-law a simple, innocuous question: ""I have nipples, Greg. Could you milk me?"". As soon as the question leaves his lips, it's clear that the movie is completely in control of its eponymous premise. Via a series of awkward interactions, haphazard misunderstandings and just a smidge of slapstick tomfoolery, the piece definitely delivers the goods when it comes to comedy. It's a fun, funny and often frustrating experience that does, essentially, exactly what it needs to. It's good-natured, remaining fairly 'feel good' even when it's putting its likeable protagonist through the wringer. Its cast is compelling and its writing is quite sharp; it's ultimately an enjoyable experience throughout. It isn't especially deep - although it hits its emotional pay-offs rather well and has a fairly major character arc - but it doesn't really need to be. It's a good time. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Terrible Movie,"This movie is almost painful to watch. You just feel sorry for Ben Stiller's character. He basically spends a couple days being tormented and humiliated by his girlfriend's family. There is no way anyone would put up with this crap in real life. I would have left the first night. He is intimidated and nervous around his girlfriend's father, and desperate for approval, so he screws up over and over, each time worse than the last. The father doesn't help matters, as he belittles and embarrasses the poor guy at every opportunity. (Sorry, I forget the characters names.) The girlfriend hardly does a damn thing to stick up for him. Then Dad's friends show up and join in on the fun. One scene in particular has them playing volleyball in the pool and they are ridiculing him for missing the ball. So then he overcompensates and ends up smashing his girlfriend's sister in the face with the ball. They all criticize him, telling him it's ""just a game, Focker!"" and act as if he meant to hurt the girl. Another is when he finally has enough and is leaving and the whole bunch stands on the porch and laughs at his given name, which we find out is Gaylord. The girlfriend says nothing, just letting the poor guy take another kick in the teeth after all the other humiliation he's been through for her sake. The entire family is totally unlikable, Focker is the only one I cared about, and that's only because I was forced to care by watching this poor guy get put through the ringer over and over. Then comes the contrived ending where everything is made good in about five minutes and he forgives all. If I were this guy, I would never speak to these psychos again. Sorry to run on so much, but this movie really affected me and I couldn't see how someone could laugh at this guy's misfortunes. Maybe it's just me...",,Anonymous,Romance
DeNiro and Stiller make a surprisingly effective comic duo...,"MEET THE PARENTS was the surprise hit of 2000 that firmly established comic credentials for dramatic actor Robert DeNiro and put Ben Stiller on the map. Ben plays Greg Focker, a male nurse who after becoming engaged to a schoolteacher (Teri Polo) nervously agrees to accompany her to her sister's wedding in order to meet his future father-in-law (DeNiro). Greg is naturally freaking out and try as he may, once he and Dad meet, everything that can go wrong for Greg does and it just gets worse for him as the story progresses. Stiller is wonderful as the hassled and harried everyman whose intentions are always good but the end results are never what he planned. But the real surprise here is two-time Oscar winner DeNiro in a deft comic turn as Jack Burns, the father-in-law from hell who turns out to be a former CIA agent. DeNiro proves to be equally adept at comedy here, instinctively knowing when to take center stage and when to let young Stiller shine. Polo is attractive as Pam, the woman caught between these two guys and Blythe Danner is lovely as Jack's wife and Pam's mother. Owen Wilson also provides some grins as Pam's ex-fiancée who Jack adores. Though the misery that gets heaped on Greg throughout the length of the film seems to be a bit much, the smart screenplay and attractive cast make for an entertaining comic romp.

My former in-laws-oye,"This has to be the most uncomfortably hilarious comedy I have seen or I should say felt involved with in years. The whole family and their friends VS Mr.Gaylord Focker (Ben Stiller). A father-in-law to be is not just an overly literal and abundantly-overbearing wall in the way of the progress of asking with the best intentions for the man's daughters hand in marriage. Every time he turns around someone in that family of Pam's is verbally being cold blooded or condescending toward Greg Focker aka Gaylord, and then laughing about it. Or even accusing him of doing things that he hasn't done. With a case of nerves as it is it doesn't help to be even more nervous and doing something by mistake that will be under a finer micro-scope by the parents and friend of the wedding party. From the supposed pot smoking that they accused him of to lying about his taking the 'M Cats' test to anything else that they feel like saying to him, or about him. This reminded me of my past in-laws. What a freaking mess.The breakfast scene where he enters their kitchen in pjs and the grooms mother quips, ""looks like someone had a visit from the hair fairy."" Then on Greg's way out of the kitchen to go shower, he jokes and sez, ""Well I guess it's time for me to visit the shower fairy."" And everyone just looks at him as if to say 'Oh Greg grow up'. I can identify with most of this whole feature. The director was brilliant in making an awkwardly close to the bone for me, movie about unwed bliss. DeNiro is masterful in this role. He is simply the one that fits it to a tee. Well scripted and maintained through out the entire story, this one with Owen Wilson was a spectacle to look and laugh and cringe at all at the same time while feeling awkward and gawky and nervously smiling with the rest of the nervous fiancée's out there.This was a one of a kind fun-filled slightly bend out of shape picture with an original feel, that makes it not equal to all the other cinema fare out there that 'comes and goes' with little staying power.Jay Roach is a cool and talented director.

Funny but Gaylord lacks strength,"Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) is a happy male nurse who has a great girlfriend Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo). He wants to propose to her, but have to get her father Jack's (Robert De Niro) permission. Only Jack isn't the trusting kind.This starts off pretty much as expected with awkward uncomfortable interactions. The movie goes from awkward laughs to uncomfortable silences. The lie detector scene is especially funny. What makes it problematic for me is that Focker is a bit of a weasel. He's constantly trying to lie his way out of things. It's not a likable trait.I'm not talking about the cat lie. That's a defensible move. But he's too weasely even when it makes no sense. When Kevin (Owen Wilson) is getting his goat, Greg tries to puff himself up even though Jack is right there who could easily out him. It's in his nature and that's a problem.The movie has a lot of fun, and the ending is heart warming. But I have to downgrade it a little for Greg's personality. Ben Stiller plays him a little too pathetic when it would be better to have a little confidence. It's better to have him as a reasonable nice man who's dealing with a crazy Jack.

Meet The Parents Or Not?,"'Meet the Parents' is a comedy that's funny enough for an evening watch. The central characters Pam and Greg are very likable but the Pam's family are portrayed to be slightly a bit of a caricature. I find it a bit far-fetched that everyone hates Greg. Even Pam's mother reacts with indifference. I mean she does 'object' but it's as if she could care less. But then again, 'Meet the Parents' is about the tension between Greg and Jack and both De Niro and Stiller do well with their comic abilities. Even though De Niro's character is less likable, it is nice to see him in a comedic role for a change. Stiller is his usual goofy on screen persona (a part he's best at doing). However, due to the director's focus on this, the romantic angle between Polo's Pam and Stiller's Greg isn't well developed, but Teri Polo does a good job. Blythe Danner is adequate (though I don't know whether it was the director's intention to present her as being indifferent towards Jack's cruelty). The toilet and sex humour could have been toned down as it is the overload use that brings the entertainment factor down for me. Also the story follows the old formula of a guy trying to impress his girlfriend's parents, therefore the freshness is lacking. Even so, there are a lot of loose ends such as what happens to Jack's son and his pot. But, in spite of the flaws there are a few genuine funny moments and I liked the 'race' scene towards the end, Greg's problems with the flight attendant, and Greg's attempt to propose to Pam at the beginning of the movie. Roach's direction isn't of the remarkable sort and 'Meet the Parents' mostly works to an extent because of the actors. This could have been more of a fun ride had it not been too over-the-top but it's hell of a lot better than the sequel.

The fact they're together without benefit of clergy is enough to disqualify him from the start so Polo says let's not mention it. The second is that Stiller is a male nurse and that's not quite manly enough for dad to see as a profession for a son-in-law.Observing it all and keeping mum is Mom, Blythe Danner. One wonders how she hooked up with DeNiro all those years.Stiller and DeNiro really have the comic timing down beautifully. For Stiller this is old hat for DeNiro this is a chance to show his versatility. Best scene is the whole sequence at the airport as Stiller has decided he's had enough.

Funny  but it gets difficult to laugh at Greg's misfortune,"Greg Focker is ready to propose to his girlfriend Pam but before he does he finds out that she would expect him to ask her father first.  On the visit to meet her parents however nothing goes to plan and Pam's father Jack dislikes Greg immediately.  Matters are only made worse when Greg begins to realise what Jack used to do for a living.I first saw this in a cinema and recently watched it again on video.  In the cinema I roared and on video I laughed but not as much  the crowd helped the first time.  However it is still very funny  Focker is the most put-upon man I've ever seen!  However with this comes the main problem  I almost felt too sorry for him to be able to laugh at his misfortunes.  This isn't help by the fact that most of Jack's doctor friends are really unpleasant obnoxious people who I wanted to slap.  However much of it is still funny but the final act is difficult because he is so downcast you can't help but feel sympathetic rather than amused.Stiller does a good character but really is almost too realistic  like I said, I felt a bit guilty laughing.  De Niro and comedy are not always best friends (he has some good ones and some real bad ones), happily here he is really good sending up his tough guy image spot on.  Of the rest of the cast I have nothing to say, except that Owen Wilson has a great cameo playing up his laid back character really well.Overall this is really funny even if it lacks subtlety.  However it is really a bad point that, once the misfortunes begin getting worse and more severe we do begin to feel for Greg and dislike those who mock him.  However when we laugh we also mock him and therefore I found the second half a little harder to laugh at  mind you it was still funny for the majority.",,Anonymous,Romance

It has its flaws, but the laughs outweigh those flaws.  First of all, I have to give most of the credit to Robert DeNiro. Many compliment this movie because of Ben Stiller, but I feel DeNiro added more of the laughs.  His reactions to Stiller's foolish antics are what made me laugh the loudest.  It shows that comedy is best when you play it out seriously.  Certain gags, some of which the film is best known for, simply fall flat.  The dinner table scene where Stiller talks about milking a cat and DeNiro gets choked up reading a poem drags out and is badly paced.  In the volleyball scene, when Stiller spikes the ball on that girl's face, I wasn't laughing either.  I don't think I'm being a stickler when I say that you can't show someone bleeding and in pain in a gag and expect a laugh. But there are other gags that work with flying colors.  I liked the bomb-bomb-bomb joke, and many of the latter scenes when Stiller's at the airport and running into problems with dumb employees.All in all, it's an uneven comedy that's way too silly at times, but there are enough laughs for it to deserve a recommendation.  As I said before, much kudos to DeNiro for a priceless comic performance.My score:  7 (out of 10)",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Man with funny name tries to impress demonic father-in-law to be: everything goes wrong.,"Greg (Ben Stiller) is a regular joe trying to impress a psychotic manipulative trouble-making father-in-law to be. It seems to make matters worse, however, that he's also a male nurse, jewish, and his legal name is Gaylord Focker, in this movie which is about as pleasant as taking a visit to a tooth-pulling dentist who is against using anaesthetics.The riffing on Greg's name is primary-school grade humour, and has that feeling of a cheap joke, kind of that ""i can feel a song coming on"" feeling in bad musicals, just as bad is the ""we're throwing in a funny line"" feeling.This is one of those movies where everything you could imagine might go wrong - does - and always to the detriment of poor Ben Stiller. By the time the resolution started happening, it was too late. There were just too many bad things that happened to Greg Focker.All this is not to say that its bad quality. Stiller hits the uncomfortable fiance thing perfectly. And the script is good - there are many moments, especially within the first half hour, that anyone who's ever met the parents before can associate with.Is it enjoyable, though? No, i didn't think so. Ironically, its because they draw you in so much that its so upsetting. You simply can't accept these tragic situations as comedy - you feel too sorry for Greg Focker.The resolution is fairly forced and implausible.6/10. But not for me. Too sadistic.Highlight: the airline hostess at the end.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not Very Funny,"""Meet the Parents"" marries two actors, Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller, fresh off hysterical comic films, ""Analyze This"" and ""There's Something About Mary"" respectfully. Each is reprising the type of role they had in the previous film. One would think that ""Meet the Parents"" should be a sidesplitting romp. Right? Wrong. Unlike their previous two films, ""Meet the Parents"" seems forced and contrived. Sure there are some laughs, but there is little humanity in this outing, it's more a cold fish. I found I didn't like either Stiller's or De Niro's characters. And the chemistry between any of the characters is missing. Therefore, for me, the jokes weren't funny, and were often disturbing. Yeah, I know most critics liked ""Meet the Parents"" and it made tons of money, it's just that I don't understand why.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Comedy classic. Solid as a rock. Terrific acting by the dorky Ben Stiller and the maniacal Robert de Niro. Seen it many times, cracks me up again and again. Just great!","What is so great about the very first ""Meet the Parents"" edition, is the simple fact that the characters act credibly. However funny the scenes and misunderstandings can get, the seriousness with which everyone acts, adds to the credibility of the characters. I need to be able to believe in the characters, before I can laugh about the shameful and hilarious situations they get themselves into. This credibility is missing in the 2 sequels.Robert de Niro is the best in serious acting. The man becomes funny because he is FEARED. I constantly got the feeling that he could smash someones skull in with a baseball bat. There is always that looming maniac inside de Niro's characters. Combine that with the dorky goofiness of Ben Stiller and we've got a comedy match made in heaven.Need I tell the story? The title says it all.

Ben Stiller plays a wimp.,"The entire idea that Ben Stiller's character has to be afraid isn't funny and wears thin very quickly. His character is such a wimp and is concerned about pleasing everyone so badly, he ends up doing really foolish things. Not funny, just foolish. I can't understand why Robert De Niro accepted a part in this movie. Robert De Niro is such a great actor, and this is almost a silly kids movie. Ben Stiller's character in constant fear of, well, nothing is a bad plot concept. The idea that he would allow his future father-in-law to connect him to a lie detector and answer questions just shows how truly wimpy he comes across. His love interest, is also one-dimensional.

"""I've nipples GREG, would you milk me?""","GREG FOCKER (Ben Stiller) is a male nurse that loves his girlfriend PAM (Teri Polo) and wants to ask her in marriage, but after he gets to know that his future Father-in-Law (JACK BYRNE, played by Robert De Niro) would appreciate he would ask him his daughter first, he decides that would be fine to meet her parents on that purpose. So he goes to spend a weekend in her parents' home. Well, that weekend will not be easy to GREG, as an amount of unlucky occurrences happen, having always the same protagonist, GREG. Or I should say GAYLORD FOCKER (his real official name! LOL!).One more time Ben Stiller is great doing this kind of character. He's perfect performing the unlucky guy who just want a change but for whom everything gets always wrong! Robert De Niro, on his side, also performs a good and funny character, but that stills too close to his image. I thought that at least in this movie (a romantic comedy!) he wouldn't be a member of CIA Anyway I liked the performances from all actors. I just think that Owen Wilson's role is too short. Funny as he is he deserved better, but he was at the beginning of his career I supposeIt's a funny and entertaining movie, with great laughs. Some of them made me cry of laughing!

This movie should have a 10! What is wrong with you people?,"Do not get me on another anti - anti semitic rant. I will restrain myself for now. This is one of my favorite husband and wife movies. The thing that stands out most about this movie and of which I have commented on my art blog is: the relationship between Greg and Pam's Dad is exactly how my dad and me would get along. For example one time my dad made me rake the leafs in our huge lawn. I did what my dad said as always when it came to yard work. I grabbed the rake and started to rake and the thing fell apart in my hands because the wood was so old and weak. Also my tennis racket broke when I was on the HIgh School Tennis team that I got a letter and numbers reward for. I asked my dad to let me borrow his old tennis rackets and I served with one and it broke, then while using the next one, it broke too, because they were both rotting old wood. My Dad took both incidents as a malicious act against him. Eventually my dad and I had a close brother like relationship, latter in life, those High School years were exactly like the movie here. No matter how hard I tried not to; I did everything I could to make my dad angry with me, mostly unintentionally. I do not condone Greg painting the cats tail at all, I would never do that to a animal. You have to feel bad for Greg no matter what he does in this movie when all he wants to do is marry the love of his life. I love the perplexed look on Pam's mom's face after Robert De Niro says they are out of Tom Collins mix. Too top it all off Robert De Niro even looks like my dad in this movie and when ever he had a party he would always serve Tom Collins. The fact that Pam takes Greg's side, no matter how much Robert De Niro tries to separate them for his own selfish desires; shows how they were meant to be husband and wife. Anyone that has had a hard time with their parents will love comparing this movie to that as a therapeutic thing. We should all look back on things and laugh and this movie encourages that.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Ah, this was good...","Meeting the parents of his fiancée might be a daunting prospect for any guy - especially when he intends asking permission for their daughter's hand in marriage. Ben Stiller is perfectly cast as Greg, who plans to do just that the weekend of Pam's sister's wedding. But Greg is about to start questioning just how badly he wants to marry Pam (Teri Polo)...Despite all his wrong-doings, Greg is a very likable fella - and I couldn't help feeling sorry for him. I also couldn't help wondering why he didn't decide to dump Pam. I mean honestly, Pam was not a very nice character. I really didn't like her all that much and never rooted for her in any way. Speaking of likable characters, I also enjoyed Kevin (Owen Wilson), Pam's ex-boyfriend. He was a sincere, understanding, and humble character despite his obvious success and wealth.Ah, and then there's Jack - played by the legendary Robert De Niro. He was just wonderful. Make no mistake, the mere thought of having Jack as a Father-in-law might be any guy's nightmare, but I loved De Niro in this role! And then there's Pam's mother, Dina (Blythe Danner). In the midst of all the chaos and mayhem, she was the one character that held it together, and tried her best to keep the peace no matter what.Everything Greg goes through might be a bit too much for one weekend, but it was a lot of fun.

The Day Where Everything Went Wrong,"Greg Focker isn't the stuff that heroes are made of but he's the perfect subject for heading a comedy film about a series of disasters. He's a soft-spoken and shy boy, easily miffed by the behaviour of more dominant types.Greg wants to propose to his wife but happens to catch a conversation of her ecstatic over how her sister has just gotten engaged and the sister's betrothed had the class to ask the father for her hand in marriage first. Monkey see, monkey do.So Greg decides to go to do the same, but the father, played by DeNiro, is absolutely intent on being impossible to please. Aside from that, Focker happens to experience an unlucky streak that weekend.And for this one it's the plot that really shines. Everything that can go wrong does go wrong, from natural disasters to social faux pas'. Buildings burn down, septic systems malfunction, and cats get lost, among a plethora of other mishaps.The writers were delightfully creative in showing a broad myriad of ways in which a person can be excluded from a group, from the subtle to the outrageous. Focker is casually ribbed for his profession as a male nurse, he's asked awkward questions by people with power over him, people simply don't laugh at his jokes. There are so many ways to belittle a member (or prospective member) of a group without actually kicking them out or insulting them directly. It's a fascinating look at in-group/out-group social dynamics.It's a genuinely funny movie, but I'm afraid the ending is too weak to merit a 10. Things are just easily resolved for no reason. Also the romance between Focker and his fiance is not well-developed. Either Teri Polo is a wooden actress or the pair has little chemistry. However, perhaps that adds to the sense of Focker's isolation amidst these subtly hostile strangers.Honourable Mentions: Meet the Fockers (2004). The follow-up movie was wisely set up in a line of dialogue near the end of this movie. I say wisely because Parents was something of a clear masterpiece in comedy. However, Meet the Fockers is a much weaker movie. The most interesting about it was how Teri Polo had left such a weak impression in Parents that I didn't recognise her and thought they had switched out the address for the second movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Meet the Parents is a well written and well directed comedy - Ben Stiller is brilliant as Greg Focker,"Meet the Parents chronicles a series of unfortunate events that befall a good-hearted but hapless nurse (Ben Stiller as Greg Focker) while visiting his girlfriend's parents (Robert De Niro as Jack Byrnes and Blythe Danner as Dina Byrnes). Teri Polo and Owen Wilson also star in the film.Being written by Jim Herzfeld and John Hamburg, the script is quite great with realistic, relatable and likeable characters, and a well written plot. There's so many things this film does right in the writing aspect of the production, even among the best scripts for comedies I've seen. Jay Roach directs the first film of the trilogy, doing some incredible work with ""Meet the Parents"", his direction are one of the reasons why this movie works so well.In understanding Robert De Niro's character, we have to know the character he plays and it's of course the father. Jack Byrnes is a retired CIA agent and a Vietnam War veteran who is overprotective of his family. It can be said that De Niro didn't really try that much for the performance but the parts that's easy to miss are the subtle details, and how he just nails the overprotective role, it's such a normal attribute of a man who have been through that much. Seeing him interact with Ben Stiller's character, Greg Focker is a male nurse and Pam's boyfriend. They are two completely different people with different personalities and the performances says a lot. Both Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro are great in this film, lots of the actors execute the dialogue perfectly which makes the comedic moments quite golden. This shows Ben Stiller at his best, his comedic style is perfect for the character.If we're going into the themes that ""Meet the Parents"" go into, they're quite a few. But the two big things to note is of course the cultural differences with Greg Focker being a middle-class Jewish nurse whose social and cultural position is much different than the Byrnes family of upper-class white protestants. The cultural differences are often highlighted, and how the writers made Greg aware of them made them achieve comedic effect through character development, they nailed the character driven comedy parts of the film and I can't praise them enough. It's also been commented upon as being indicative of thematic portrayal of Jewish characters' roles in modern film as well as being a prime example of how male nurses are portrayed in media which have sadly often been stereotyped in films and television but also in the world. One of the common misconceptions about men in nursing is that of a man who accepts a career in nursing as an unfortunate secondary career choice, either failing to become a physician or still trying to become one. Such stereotyping is due to a presumption that a man would prefer to be a physician but is unable to become one due to lack of intelligence or non-masculine attributes. Barbara Cherry said in her book ""Contemporary Nursing: Issues, Trends, & Management"" of the portrayal of Greg as a nurse, one of the most positive film portrayals of men who are nurses. That says a lot for representation.Meet the Parents is overall a great comedy film, doing things in a brilliant way in a story that have been done more times than I can count. Writing, direction and acting is great. Even the cinematography and musical score is impressive, better than I expected. To be honest, I didn't expect this film to be this good.

Towards the end the movie does take a turn for the better, although the end is not very surprising. It is the way the cliche-ending is handled that is especially funny.Good movie to see.

This film is hilarious and filled with lessons to live by.By the end of the film, viewers will realize there is two stories in this film. The main being from the point of view of Gregg and the secondary is about Jack and his love of his first-born child, Pam. The film has moments of emotional impact, mostly sadness for Greg, but I feel it is more educational than emotional.

A perfectly passable way to pass the time,"MEET THE PARENTS - 2000Directed by Jay RoachStarring Ben Stiller, Robert De Niro and Terri PoloPlot Overview:​ Everything that can possibly go wrong for groom-to-be Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) does. The problems begin with Greg's disastrous first meeting with his girlfriend's family -- most notably her intimidating father Jack Byrnes (Robert De Niro) and it's all downhill from there.This is a fine movie. It isn't good. It is not great. It is a perfectly passable way to spend your time. There is an odd trend with comedy movies I have watched recently. A painfully long and slow start with no laughs or smiles but then then, when the ball gets rolling, I start to consistently laugh. I am confident that people will find this movie infinitely more funny and interesting than me but then I guess I am just not their demographic. And that is unfortunate.The idea for this movie is pretty fun and I have no doubt relatable to many. As to the actual plot, it is competently written and has a flowing narrative but I think they set it up way too much to make Focker seem loathsome. The situations he gets into are logical with the plot and are sometimes funny but they went way overboard with making me dislike Focker. I like the ending; it's funny and works well within context of the plot.I don't like Ben Stiller as an actor in most things he is in and that is no different here. His performance is pretty lazy and his character is so loathsome that I couldn't in good conscience root for him. I can not stand his character. He possessed no charming or likable qualities and was just an all around boring character.Robert De Niro was great in this movie. He cracked the perfect balance of lovable and loathsome and did it with a smile. Jack is a really fun and interesting character and both supports and negates the overall stereotype that the film is about.The performances from the supporting cast were all fine but I wasn't interested in any of their characters.The editing and cinematography were both passable.This movie started off REALLY slow and unfunny but, as time progressed, the jokes began to hit more and more frequently and I found myself laughing a lot more than I did in the beginning. That said, I didn't laugh nearly as much as I would usually do in a comedy. The gags became stale for me and it all relied on the characters being in 'hilarious and awkward situations'. This worked on occasion but the more they did it, the less fun it became.De Niro's performance and the occasional funny moments give me enough to cautiously recommend this movie. See it if you must but I can't say you will become enlightened. I'll rate his film 6 Spray- painted cats out of 10!",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"A few good laughs, mostly due to the good actors; but an uneven effort at times","Well, this movie should be watched with disbelief fully suspended, since it is essentially a farce mixed with a heavy dose of slapstick.  It was pretty stupid and unoriginal at times, and often elicited groans from me (more stupid pet tricks.)  But it was also delightful and funny at times, mostly in the smaller moments that were a little less over the top, but also in some of the setup and ""payoff"" in some of the writing.  For instance, I thought the outcome of the pool volleyball game was funny and kind of shocking at the same time -- but in a very good way. ;)Most of what made the film mildly entertaining for me was simply the performances by Ben Stiller and Robert DeNiro.  Neither role was that much of a stretch for either of them, as they both were firmly planted in self-parody territory, doing what we've seen them do many times before. Still, even though Stiller and DeNiro are doing little more than selling their ""dog and pony act,"" they are really good at it, and I still enjoyed what they did most of the time anyway.All in all, if you go in with the right attitude (not expecting too much), you'll surely get a few good laughs before you get back in the car and go home.

Not really suitable for grown-ups,"Perhaps this film gets better towards the end. I wouldn't know; I walked out after about forty minutes.The central premises of the film are that only a monster wouldn't find the Ben Stiller character lovable; and that the Robert de Niro character is a monster. It didn't work for me; Stiller was silly and tedious - the sort of guy any responsible father would want to keep out of the family - and de Niro was much less overbearing and unpleasant than he might have been. Perhaps he should have been played by a slimy Limey? That could have made for much more interesting (but less contrived) plot and characterisation, without necessarily changing the nature of the film.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good Comedy!,"I first saw Meet The Parents on holiday in France when I visited some relatives and I have to say it was worth the entrance fee. It is one of the funniest films I've seen for a while, most of the seens where very humorous although a bit over the top. Ben Stiller for me the king of the comedian actors proves it again as the likeable, calamity Greg, and if you liked him in this try 'Theres Something About Mary' just looking at this guy makes me laugh. Robert De Niro also shows the lengths of his acting range as the over-protective ex CIA spy hunter dad Jack, I love the way he calls Greg by his surname FOCKER.  There is also satisfactory supporting roles from Teri Polo, Blythe Danner and John Abrahams. So overall Meet The Parents is a great comedy to watch with the family.Mark: 7/10",,Anonymous,Romance

Love does NOT make you this stupid,"Hollywood seems obsessed with the character type played by Ben Stiller. Supposedly intelligent but displays amazing levels of stupidity, but in the end proves that he does have a brain. I thought things were looking up with the early scene with the kids. I thought it was clever, funny and romantic, but due to the overheard comment he backs down on this planned event. His intelligence went down from there. The gags are all predictable as were the characters. De Niro & Danner give solid performances. What is it with Stiller and animals? The bit with the volleyball...one minute he's a dork, the next he's Michael Jordon...lame. Other reviewers have said it better than I, in summary, wait for the video. P.S.

Not Bad,"Although occasionally awkward, Meet the Parents really is a time well spent at the movies. DeNiro was a real winner. The film was well worth watching if only for his sake.

Funny and pretty realistic too!,"I usually don't laugh as many times as I did while watching Meet the Parents. This comedy was hilarious and I enjoyed watching the relationship between Robert DeNiro and Ben Stiller on the screen. One of the things I liked most about this movie was that it stayed focused on the plot. It didn't go off in different directions and it maintained a sense of reality that a lot of comedies lack. At the same time, it was funny from beginning to end. I'd have to say that another thing that makes this movie work well is that the relationship between Gaylord (Greg) and Pam is already in progress from the start of the movie so the viewer is immediately able to get to know the two of them and the relationship they have with each other. I have no complaints about this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Meet The Cliché,"I have watched this movie a few times now, just because it's always on TV. Ben Stiller isn't epic with the love interest scenes, but him and Robert DiNero kill their scenes for what they're given. It perfectly sums up the terrifying feelings men go through when they meet the in-laws for the first time. It's my nightmare, down to the cat, who the hell prefers a cat over a dog? The breakfast scene is the worst. Owen Wilson's character is the most punchable guy on the planet. I would have dropped that fool the second I met him, like we were on the yard and I needed to establish the fact that I'm top dog now. I think the second installment with Greg's parents is one of the few cases where the sequel may surpass the original, even though the original is nothing to write home about, it does have that comfortable feeling of familiarity.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

What a let down,"'Meet the Parents' turned out to be. The basis for my disappointment was the few recommendations from friends had led me to believe this was going to be the funniest experience I'd ever had in the cinema. Well, Duck Soup it was not!On the whole I tend to like slow studied movies that leave things unsaid so as to make the viewer do some work. It certainly is slow, and studied, overly so. In fact, for the most part you can see the 'jokes' coming a mile off. The Art of Humour works when the unexpected occurs. Most of hilarity surrounding De Niro's plodding, sceptical overprotective nature as a prospective father-in-law gave a one paced, one dimensional feel to what ought to have been very funny. A good attempt all the same. The film kept itself above the level of pure slapstick. One or two moments generated sighs of sympathy rather than laughs. Still, as humour goes this was infinitely better than 'Police Academy' slapstick. There was a plot. The young man was on a mission, to win the consent of the de Niro for his daughter's hand, only it might have faired better with a little more complexity and depth.The one really bright spark to emerge from this film was Terri Polo who, while being new to me, is someone I shall look out for in future movies. She brought a believable air to the proceedings, and the fact she is breathtakingly beautiful was not lost on me either! Had she been the girl who lived next door to me I've a funny feeling I'd actually be the one prancing around on Robert de Niro's roof instead!!",,Anonymous,Romance
Farelli brothers could have done it better,"I cannot say it was a disappointment that I felt after this movie, but I really felt sorry for Robert De Niro, who falls lower and lower after his recent attempts as a comedy star. Remember ""Flawless"", ""Analyze it""? I also recall his last performance in ""Men of Honour"".. A question: ""Mr. De Niro, are you going to show us the level of performance you had 10 years ago or so, or should I put the film out of my agenda when I see your name in the cast?""Anyway, other cast members were not any better. Ben Stiller still tries to get dividend from his once-winning role in ""There's something about Mary"". But this material was too raw, and it did not have the level of Farelli's movie.In total, I think the toilet-jokes already make the public yawning. I am sure next summer we will see something like ""You, yourself and Irene"", ""Meet my grand-parents"" or ""There's nothing about Cameron Diaz"". But isn't it a time to find something new in comedy genre?I heard that the studio was already preparing the ""Meet the Parents - 2""..Goshh!

Does not live up to the hype and buzz,"This is a funny film, but not a non-stop journey into motion picture hilarity, as ""Scary Movie"" earlier this year was.  The hype, buzz and advertising made me believe this was one of the funniest movies in the past decade.  Not so.  It's funny enough, but, after a while, the father's nuttyness gets to be a little too much and, frankly, quite annoying.  I did not hate it, but after seeing and reading everything, was diappointed.  Teri Polo is beautiful and finally gets her rightful place in a big-time flick. Should make her a star, just as ""Almost Famous"" did for Kate Hudson.  Owen Wilson is also effective as Kevin.  Blythe Danner seems to phone-in her role as Mother.  And Bobby D, is well, okay in the role, but my qualm is not with him but with the writer.  Funny, but not great.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hilarious!,"I noticed that some people have said that the gags in this movie are unfunny and predictable... they complained about not very many laugh-out-loud gags. I completely disagree.This movie is one of the smartest comedies of the last few years. It does not rely on gross-out gags (like Something About Mary, etc...) and still manages to be hilarious. All of the humor is contained in the intelligence of the writing and the tenseness of the situations in the movie. Yes, you feel very sorry for Greg, but it feels OK in this movie to laugh at his expense.When I initially saw the previews for this movie a few years ago I had no desire to see it, as it seemed like it would be just like any other generic comedy. I only ended up seeing it because I had nothing better to do some random Friday night. I was very pleasantly surprised!This movie is not at all a generic comedy. The gags are brilliantly crafted and completely original. I think that people who think this movie is generic do not appreciate intelligent, non-bathroom humor. The praying scene and Jack's poem at the dinner table are brilliant. Also Greg's run-in with the flight attendant is great.Maybe the thing that really did it for me in this movie is that, despite their weirdness, Pam's family is completely believable and real. I actually know people like that. There is a whole culture of upper-class people who really do behave like the Byrnes family in this movie. I thought it was hilarious that the movie was making fun of that culture (I am also reminded of the groom's family in My Big Fat Greek Wedding). That part really struck home with me and made the movie even more funny.Great movie! Not generic at all! Very original and laugh-out-loud funny.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
DeNiro as himself using the Jewish Kabbalh and Hasidism in art.,"DeNiro plays the part of a retired intelligence about to marry his daughter to the character Gaylord Focker. They claim in the movie that the character Jack used to be in the Central Intelligence Agency. But if anyone knows about the intelligence community this could be any organization authorized to operate with U.S. intelligence data.From my point of view I like to think of the actor DeNiro using and wearing his yamaka in some film to express his hidden heritage as being Jewish. As in the movie Analyze That when DeNiro ties up customers in a diamond shop. So in this movie Meet The Parents I think DeNiro again is playing the the concept of religion with the Jewish Kabbalh and Hasidism. This religious concept has the religious concept written from my research that it is common to pass on the family secrets to a son-in-law.Of course throughout the movie Jack is cautious and skeptical, which is probably common for a retired intelligence agent with world culture. The acting is pretty good creating a relaxed environment for entertainment with good setups for the short exciting action sequences. Camera lighting and film quality are also top noch.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro Comedy,"Greg ""Gaylord"" Focker played by Ben Stiller is a male nurse who is invited to meet is fiancé to be Pam's parents so that he can get their permission. However, former CIA Agent Jack Byrnes played by Robert De Niro puts Greg through a living hell before anything happens. While staying at the house he finds out that his luggage is misplace by the airport and later gets the third degree from Jack. With Jack, being a former CIA agent he uses tactics he learned to make sure that Greg is the right man for his little girl. The motif based around Greg's struggles thought the whole movie. From the struggles with his luggage, the male nurse insults, to the invasive questioning from Jack. Yet being a heavy struggle for him the comedy is flowing like all movies that star Ben Stiller. Furthermore, although Jack does play sarcastic, aggressive parents there are many comic scenes that make the movie funny as well. Next, Kevin played by Owen Wilson is trying to get back Pam the girl he had lost in his past. During time that Kevin had met Greg, Kevin keeps telling Greg about the good times that him and Pam had in their past. This puts a little frustration as well as comical competition between them. Since her family is completely overwhelmed with Kevin, Greg has to go out of his way to show Pam's family he is the right man her. Another one of the more comic parts of the movie is when the cat goes to the next-door neighbors but Greg thinks he is lost and tries to replace it with a stray. When the stray gets into the house the wedding dress of Pam's sisters shredded by the cat, yet everyone else is at dinner. While Greg is placing calls to find out about his luggage, Jack is finding about the cat and also finding out more about Greg's past. The final draw is when her family is insulting him about not becoming a doctor and his name, which is Gaylord. Whenever Jack gets the rest of the information back about Greg, after Jack finds out that everything that he said was true he feels that Greg should be placed back into his family's inner circle once again. But by that time Greg is getting on the plane to head back and gets arrested by security for attacking a flight attendant and Jack has to use his CIA Agent security to get him out of trouble. Throughout this movie, there have always been struggles against Greg but the audience will laugh through every one of them.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A poor man's ""There's Something About Mary""","This movie has its moments, but it underutilizes most of its cast (particularly Owen Wilson, Stiller and DeNiro) and as farcical plot device is heaped upon farcical plot device it drives towards a particularly boring and empty dramatic crisis, necessitated by the dictates of its formulaic and manipulative narrative.  Fortunately that crisis lasts only 10 minutes, but while it's going on you really wish you were somewhere else.  Stiller is excellent as always, and his performance, basically a reprise of his Something About Mary role of comical downtrodden everyman, is what really holds the movie together.  The scene on the airplane, the car racing scene, and the final scene of the movie made me laugh pretty damn hard.

Meet(ing) the Parents has never been more amusing,"I crawled into the cinema after a particularly hot Melbourne day looking for something light and entertaining (i.e. not too taxing on the grey matter) and Meet the Parents certainly fit the bill.Robert de Niro's role, Jack Burns, is played convincingly and uncomfortably well.  He manages to play Jack with that evil glint that de Niro fans are all too aware of.  Ben Stiller also does well as the nervous soon to be son-in-law and Blythe Danner's Dina (the mother) is played with an almost Marilyn Munroe daffy blonde with biting insights to situations.The film itself doesn't really go anywhere, gets ridiculously silly in parts and the ending is inevitable.

"Meet the new generation of ""unfunny"" movie.","This film was a very lame attempt at been humorous. The jokes were poor, overcooked and could be seen at least two lines before hand. I didn't have a decent laugh during the whole movie and was sorry I wasted my time viewing it until the end. The worst thing about this type of baloney is that a new genre of film seems to have been invented by some studios i.e. ""unfunny"" funny film whose only reason for existence is to lull the viewing audience into some sort of trite ""twilight zone"", letting them think that they go home in a jovial and entertained mood where the exact opposite is the case as the discerning viewer goes home unfulfilled, cheated and slightly disgruntled. Unfortunately, we have been exposed to a plethora of these films for too long as more and more of this type of banal movie is served up appealing to increasingly demoralized audiences as certain movie makers lose sight of the hilarious belly busters of yesteryear with their razor sharp script writers, ludicrous plots and acting beyond belief.

scraping the bottom of the crap barrel,"I can barely describe how bad this movie is.  There are movies that are bad, but are still fun.  Then there are films like this-""shining"" examples of mediocrity and crushing banality that make you root for a plague to wipe out a good portion of the world's population, just so the ""lowest common denominator"" is represented by a smaller number of people.This is one of those situations where I am forced to believe that someone must have had compromising pictures of Robert DeNiro with an underaged goat to get him to appear in  this picture.  You know the basic plot, so I will, instead, list a number of details (that in an actually funny film, would not have distracted me)  that annoyed me to no end, and exemplify just how little thought went into this movie:1)DeNiro's character has supposedly spent his entire life undercover as a trader in rare plants, but can't recognize an orchid (might this astounding lack of knowledge ever have compromised his secrecy?); 2)He also seems to have collected ""tourist"" photos of himself standing beside very influential foreign leaders (again, would a real secret agent do this?);3)and anyway, does the CIA, or FBI just let you take home their equipment?Ben Stiller, on the other hand, seems to be singlehandedly leading the crusade to destroy the stereotype that the Jewish culture has a uniquely funny, and intelligent take on life (Mel Brooks, Woody Allen, Gene Wilder, etc.).  Here, he is just grating.  Not a single line of dialogue exists in this film for any reason other to set up another lame joke.  And since the upcoming joke is painfully obvious, it's never funny. It's just painful. This is the sort of film, that if it were an animal, you would beat to death with a shovel just to put it out of its misery, and not feel too broken up about it afterwards.This is the stinking sludge of our strip-mall, brain-dead culture, written by your drunken frat-brother who thinks that septic-tank overflows and guys named ""Focker"" are the height of ""edgy"".

I just loved this movie and I'm normally not a Ben Stiller fan,"I know it's a bit weird, but I saw ""Meet the Fockers"" before I saw this movie. The reason for that is because I hadn't had the chance yet to see this one, when I went with some friends to the cinema and they all wanted to see the sequel. They all loved the first one, so I didn't mind giving ""Meet the Fockers"" a try. And all I can say about it is that I was rather disappointed by it. The only thing that made me believe this one was better, was because my friends didn't like the sequel all that much either.In this movie we see Gaylord 'Greg' Focker (Ben Stiller) who wants to ask his girlfriend (Teri Polo) to marry him. But first he'll have to meet her parents, because her strict father (Robert DeNiro) expects to be asked for his daughter's hand before she can accept. Normally meeting the parents of your fiancée shouldn't be too bad, but Jack Byrnes is a former CIA agent who never has liked any of his daughter's boyfriends and Greg Focker won't be an exception to that rule. He makes Greg's life miserable, while Murphy's Law does the rest by turning Greg into a master of disaster...I have to admit that I didn't have too high expectation about this movie after seeing the sequel, but now I know one thing for sure: they should have stopped with the first one, because this is an excellent comedy. I was laughing all the time and really liked it enormously. Even though I'm not a big Ben Stiller fan (I hated ""Zoolander"" and wasn't all too keen on ""Duplex"" and ""Meet the Fockers""), I must say that he did a great job in this movie.

"Often funny, though over-the-top","""Meet the Parents"" is an over-the-top comedy that begs for laughs like a cinematic vagrant.  It attacks you at every corner, begging for some laughs, hoping you can spare some.  Luckily, I was generous and was gracious enough to donate a sufficient amount of laughs.  This is a boisterous sitcom of a movie that occasionally drives you nuts, but often pleases.Bobby D has made a fine transition to comedy, and although others feel he's not suited for the genre--being stuck on his Travis Bickle persona--I think he's cut out just fine for films of this kind.  You know why?  He doesn't GO for laughs.  He lets the laughs come to him, and disciplines the material to a reasonable level.  Ben Stiller, on the other hand, does the complete opposite.  Stiller can be extremely funny in roles in films like ""There's Something About Mary,"" but in lame roles like in ""Heavyweights"" he can be really obnoxious!  And sometimes he tries a bit too hard to get the laughs. So hard that you just want to shoot him with a tranquilizer dart.  During lame points of the script, Stiller tries to elevate the material to a good comical status, but instead ends up looking like a complete...idiot.  Like he should be locked up in a cage.  And it's not funny.  It's just obnoxious.I am going to reccomend this movie, because I can't deny I was laughing 75 percent of the time.  And that was my motive for seeing the movie.  Of course, that and I'm a big DeNiro fan.  However, there are moments where you just want to yell out at the director ""Enough already!  We get the joke!"" The makers of the film just merge way too many jokes into one scene, and it gets pretty lame and/or predictable at times.My score:  7 (out of 10)",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

I don't mean this as harsh criticism, just an observation, and it explains why the first forty minutes were tough to sit through (when does the funny actually start?).Eventually we get to the lie detector scene, and then Ben Stiller just goes through a Curb Your Enthusiasm style of Hell; one mishap and comic misunderstanding after another, where everyone just starts to turn on the guy.

He attempts to fit in to the social circle of this traditional family, who has their own set of rules and specific ways of living that keeps him thinking on his toes and attempting to fake it till he makes it.Greg tries to make an impression with the overly protective father, Jack Byrnes, played by Robert De Niro, who has a clandestine past and is growing suspicious due to mix-ups that put Greg in a negative light for being the right man for his prized daughter. He has to drop a few habits and pick up new ones to keep up. If it could get any more worse the ex, Kevin, played by Owen Wilson, is on top of everything without evening trying, not to mention close to the father and on good terms with Greg's girlfriend. You could say he's got a lot on his plate, as he's the extreme of polite and can't say what's really on his mind out loud in order to save face in front of others.""Meet the Parents"" was fresh for its time and still holds up as a situational comedy with some relating points about meeting others for the first time or just trying to be one of the gang. It can make you cringe for the main character as he fumbles to do things right by these new people with hilarious trial and error. Just in time, some of the zany pile ups begin to get far-fetched but is saved by seeing Greg in the cross between imploding and running away from everything going wrong by his own hands. This is a Hollywood film, so some sentiment is going to be offered in order to give it that finishing touch. This was a well-done film as it steadily paced the timing of its jokes instead of trying too hard to completely shock the audience. That's what gives it its replay value to this day as the scenarios are memorable, not to mention identifiable if still exaggerated for comic relief.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Meet the Parents, finds comedy in the anxiety-filled experiences of its central character when he meets his girlfriend's demanding parents.","Not having chosen the best time to propose to his beloved Pam (Teri Polo), Greg Focker, a modest and sensible male-nurse with an unfortunate last name, soon discovers that the surest path to pleasing Pam and honoring her family starts by earning the trust of her conservative father. When Pam invites Greg to spend the next few days with her parents in New York, where they will attend her sister's wedding rehearsal, Greg realizes this is the best opportunity to meet the parents and ask for Pam's hand in marriage. Soon after their arrival at the Byrnes' mansion, while trying to dismiss the ill-experience of having lost his suitcase in transit, Greg greets Jack (Robert De Niro) and his wife (Blythe Danner) with optimism. Yet Greg 's efforts to be liked and respected aim in all the wrong directions to either disappoint or offend Jack, a retired horticulturist who lacks a sense of humor and who decides to become Greg's most adverse judge.Meet the Parents follows Greg Focker along a comical series of misadventures aimed at testing the character's composure as he struggles to disprove his faultfinding father-in-law. Never abandoning its central character's good intentions yet emphasizing its antagonist's unattainable consent, Meet the Parents also creates a few bittersweet moments as it questions the future of the character's plans to wed his increasingly distant girlfriend. Meet the Parents successfully exploits the viewer's familiarity with such stressful situations as proposing, meeting a loved one's parents or planning a wedding, and creates its comedy by pushing to the extreme its subject's numerous embarrassing and compromising positions.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Sinister Comedy,"Ben Stiller is quite a funny guy. He has one of those rubber faces that you can instantly crack up looking at. He plays Greg Focker, a male nurse in love with Meg Byrnes. The two are blissfully happy...all until it comes to meeting her parents. There's the charming, helpful mom and the ex CIA (psychotic???) dad (Robert DiNiro). I won't blabber on too much about the story except to say that you can tell just what's going to happen...one disaster after another. It's funny stuff...sometimes, with the slapstick of Stiller, but DeNiro's character may be hard to swallow and leave a bad taste as he interrogates and sometimes cooly humiliates Greg. DeNiro does play a good part; the naive father wanting the best for his daughter and no man is good enough for her. Good performances all round, but don't expect to be laughing your heart out as this film has a quite uneven balance of slapstick and sinister dryness. *** out of *****",,Anonymous,Romance
"Good, not great.","Based on R2 DVD 103 minThere's a touch of the slapstick about this better then average comedy, De Neros' character (ex CIA black ops) is interesting and at times very funny.

Funny and relatable,"Nurse Greg Focker is about to propose to his girlfriend Pam Byrnes; however Pam's father is a bit of a traditionalist and Pam is insistent that Greg seeks her father's permission first. However, Pam's father Jack proves to be no pushover and Greg knows he'll have to dig deep in order to impress him, but it seems the harder Greg tries the worse he makes things for himself...Meeting The Parents of your partner for the first time is always a daunting task and what you have here is a relatable concept which has been slightly exaggerated for comedic effect - I say slightly exaggerated, but firmly believe that there are real life Jack Byrnes type fathers out there.As well as being funny, the film does have a sweet nature to it and Greg's likeability is also a big plus. He always acts with the best of intentions when trying to please his in-laws (even though his approach at times isn't always the best). There's almost a sort of Frank Spencer type quality to Greg and I couldn't help but finding myself rooting for him and hoping things work out for him in the end.Meet The Parents basically belongs to Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro and it is these 2 actors who are responsible for the best dialogue and are involved in some of the funniest scenes in the film. I'm no big fan of Stiller, but thought that he was great here and his chemistry with De Niro was first rate. Likewise De Niro (whom I haven't always felt was particularly suited to comedy) arguably puts in the best performance which almost felt like self-parody (which is intended as a compliment). I didn't much care for Owen Wilson and didn't feel that he added much/nor was a particularly necessary addition to the story. The rest are the supporting cast are so-so, but no-one else has the impact that Stiller and De Niro have on the picture.The heart behind the picture, its relatable premise and superb performances from Stiller and De Niro that are the main reasons that Meet The Parents work so well (plus it has its fair share of laughs too) and as a whole it is wonderfully entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Robert De Niro's Funniest Movie Since Midnight Run,"A funny, good movie. I was pleased to see Robert De Niro star in a well done comedy, the best since Midnight Run. Definitely funnier than the overblown, overhyped, Analyze This. Not as good as Midnight Run, but definitely comes in second. Would have been nice for the plot to have tied up a few twists at the end, such as Robert De Niro's pot-smoking son, but still worth the laughs. It was also good to see Ben Stiller in a funny movie after the pitifull Mystery Men.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
More realistic than its sequel this Ben Stiller/Robert DeNiro film full of laughs.,"I enjoyed this film quite a bit as it was a nice look at what the male of the species has to go through when meeting his girlfriend's parents. This one plays a bit more realistically than does the sequel which only enhances this film a bit above that one. Greg wants to ask his girlfriend to marry him and is about to do so when he learns that she wants him to meet her parents so he prepares to meet them and get her father's approval before he asks her. What occurs is the old adage if something can go wrong it will. From making a poor first impression to accidentally uncorking a champagne bottle so that it hits the urn of someone's final resting place, one really has to feel for poor Greg. He not only has to get passed these sort of self inflicted wounds, but also must deal with the fact her dad is also an ex-CIA agent or something to that effect and poor Greg is in for a very troubling stay. Throw in the super smart cat capable of using the toilet, the only one on his side seems to be his beloved. Though the mother is not quite as bad as the father, in fact she is no where near as bad. Throw in an ex-boyfriend and a pool party that starts out very embarrassingly and turns ultra competitive and nothing is going right for poor Greg. Very funny movie and great performances all around. I liked that Owen Wilson was in it as he is always good in movies such as these. DeNiro and Stiller were very funny as well as both played their parts well. An all around good comedy, which me liking a comedy made after like 1999 is a rarity.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
enjoyable comedy,"My View on the narrative:.Not being a fan of the slapstick comedy drama as such I had my doubts over this film, however I'm glad to say I was surprised when sitting down to watch a completely daft unrealistic comedy but that is simply good entertainment. Ben Stiller (There's something about Mary) stars as Greg Focker, a simple nervous soul put in a vulnerable position when his girlfriend takes him to meet her parents. The simple idea spells disaster and although it's a very ambitious plot, the nature behind it is there with physical humour (watch for the garden scene) which although not laugh out loud is easy to smile to. I often felt embarrassed for the characters as this film has plenty of those 'awkward' silence moments none of us want to be involved in when meeting the parents but the fact that this conforms to every person's nightmare by the central character Stiller making a complete hash of everything is comic genius.Robert De Niro.Surprised to see him in such a role, I was very intrigued. Gone are the days when we would see him pull on the boxing gloves to fight powerfully in Oscar winning Raging Bull and the days when he would mutter 'are you talking to me?' Saying this, I am very happy to say that for me he made this film great. His observation tough guy image is reflecting in his dominance of his household over his children and guests. The comic humour De Niro presents is obviously a contrast to his tough guys days but the 'bitchy' hard hitting lines he mutters simply made me smile throughout and he was the star of this film for me.Synopsis.Meet the parents conforms to the comedy genre brilliantly and through the sensationally stereotyped Robert De Niro as the dominant intimidating father the film is a joy to watch. Although certain scenes were too ambitious for my liking but there's no question its an enjoyable watch from start to finish.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Funny and entertaining,"Since I didn't expect much before I saw this film, I was quite surprised when Meet the Parents turned out to be very entertaining and funny from the beginning to the end. Most comedies are very funny the first thirty minutes or so and then keeps going and going with about one joke per 15 minutes. That's not the case with this movie. Sure, one can discuss whether Ben Stiller can play more than one character or not, but his acting style suits this film perfectly. Of course, De Niro is brilliant as the father-in-law from hell. Meet the Parents is a genuinely funny and entertaining comedy. (7/10)",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Robert De Niro is great of course, and there are a couple of good supporting performances.

"""Meet the Parents"": Joyless, Stressful and Irritating (just like real life)","I STILL don't know what ""Meet the Parents"" was trying to tell me. Was it a comedy? I don't think so, for I found myself more and more irritated as the film progressed---this is another of those sophomoric flicks in which the characters bungle greatly, and then endeavor to SURPASS each bungle with a greater one, until the plot dissolves into pure chaos. In ""Meet the Parents,"" I'm strongly reminded of ""Blind Date"" (with Bruce Willis and Kim Bassinger)---same sort of uncomfortable, unfulfilling character exchanges, totally predictable storyline, and enough half-baked, poorly directed physical comedy to make you urp your granola.  If the intent of ""Meet the Parents"" was to fill the audience with the same sense of loathing as ACTUALLY MEETING your future in-laws, then the film succeeded.

parental advisory,"This is another topic which has been extremely used in cinema: a young man who wishes to marry his girlfriend but first he's got to ask her parents the permission. And sometimes things don't go as they are expected...By making this movie, it's clear that the director Jay Roach gave the actors a free hand perhaps so as to try to compensate an unremarkable plot. The success of the movie rests on their shoulders. I would grant a special award to Ben Stiller and of course to Robert De Niro who shows that as an actor he's always at ease and excellent after all these years spent in the cinema. Of course, we're obliged to recognize that the humor isn't always subtle, certain characters are nearly stereotyped (Owen Wilson) and the sequence where De Niro blames Stiller for not being honest whereas honesty isn't his strong point appears quite conventional. As Jack Lemmon said in ""Some like it hot"" (1959): ""Nobody's perfect"".

poor Focker,"Throughout the film, even at the end, I felt like imploring the guy, 'run for your life! She's not the one!' Pam's neglect of Greg's feelings and most of all her blindness toward her father's obsessiveness demonstrates how we never see our own family the same way other people do. You know your family is weird--but just how weird is only found through throwing a stranger at its mercy.""Parents"" begins as an overprotective-father-versus-boyfriend story, moves toward the ridiculous, but always remains believable. After a while it becomes clear that the real problem between Greg and Jack (Robert DiNiro), Pam's dad, is simple: they just don't get along. We've all come across people we know we don't like from the moment we meet them. Greg's tough luck is that his father-in-law to-be is one of these people.""Meet The Parents"" is good because it gives each character enough of a life that each has something to learn. It's also got a lot of humanity at its core. Most everyone who sees this film will be able to relate to Greg's predicament. Most everyone will recall a time when they were in Greg's shoes--or they'll come to the shocking realization that they were torturing someone and didn't know it at the time.This is a rare story in which there really is one main character around which everything else revolves. Everything that happens is connected with Greg Focker (Ben Stiller plays it perfectly; he's never been funnier). There are no unnecessary subplots that enhance supporting characters. They don't even bother giving Pam her own life. All she is, from first frame to last, is Greg's girlfriend. Jack is Greg's girlfriend's dad and so on. This puts you inside the main character's world in a way few films do.While the writers show great control over their material by doing this, they fall short in other areas. Greg's last name, Focker, and the various ways people pronounce it, is a running gag that isn't nearly as funny as the film's creators seem to think it is. Whenever things start getting dull, they pull out the old Focker joke so at least the small-minded people in the audience can get a giggle. There are moments of agony, such as truck tires spraying sewage all over Pam's family, that are so gross you can't believe what you're watching. The goal is to set this lewdness against a backdrop of suburban normalness, which makes it funnier.Supposedly anyway. More times than not, though, it works. The film does what all good entertainment does: holds a warped mirror up to real life, so we can laugh at ourselves a little.Grade: C+",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Yet this is just a set-up for the wild mishaps of the second half as Murphy's Law goes into effect.Teri looks great while Nicole DeHuff is on hand as the sister. Elsewhere, an iconic actor of the period shows up in the second half, but I don't want to give it away as it's a welcome surprise (it shouldn't be too hard to figure out seeing as how this is a Ben Stiller comedy).The sequel ""Meet the Fockers"" came out four years later and it's lousy by comparison with distasteful non-humor consisting mostly of juvenile jokes about sex from senior citizens.

Excellent comedy starring Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller!,"MEET THE PARENTS, in my opinion, is an excellent comedy starring Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller. You go, guys! My favorite parts were when Greg (Ben Stiller) accidentally hit Debbie (Nicole DeHuff) in the eye and nose with a volleyball, verbally abused the flight attendant (Kali Rocha), which resulted in an interrogation from Norm (Bernie Sheredy), and whenever he goofed off. I also laughed when Jack (Robert De Niro), and when he imitated a bugle trumpeting a fanfare right before saying, ""People, people, people, come get your revised itineraries."" I thought that he was really psychotic. This was because he couldn't seem to stop messing things up for Greg. Plus, he expected his daughters' (Nicole DeHuff and Teri Polo) boyfriends (Thomas McCarthy and Ben Stiller) to meet him and Dina (Blythe Danner) and then ask his permission before proposing to them. Also, I thought that Pam (Teri Polo) looked very beautiful in all the fancy clothing that she wore, especially the maid of honor dress she wore at Bob (Thomas McCarthy) and Debbie's wedding. I especially liked Jack's tuxedo, especially with the top hat. If you ask me, that gave it a nice touch. The ending, however, made no sense to me. It's hard for me to explain why. In conclusion, I highly recommend this smash hit to all you Robert De Niro or Ben Stiller fans out there who have not seen it. You're in for a real treat and a lot of laughs, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

I especially laughed at the sister being bopped in the eye with the volleyball scene.  But wait a minute, are there any big yocks that aren't in the trailer?  Answer:  Very few.That said, let me say that I think that this is pleasant movie well worth seeing.  Waiting for it to come out in video may not be a bad idea, though.

Excellent performances from all, but especially DeNiro and Stiller and special mention must go to the unique acting ability of Mr Jinx.All in all, a great movie to see with your family....the kids and Grandma, too...I think they'll all have smiles on their faces at the end even if they're not rolling on the floor.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

It puts a different perspective on how airlines deal with people. The airline doesn't handle baggage very well and so I can understand why he would not want to check his bag again. The fact that he said ""Its not like I have a bomb"" does not make it less funny just because 9/11 happened.

Rather than just the usual charming family repartee, ""Greg"" finds himself under a microscope of penetrative inquisition from his would-be in-law, and it gradually emerges that he has maybe held back on a few truths with ""Pam"" and he does (or doesn't) like cats. He's also a male nurse called ""Focker"" - further facts which don't really helps his cause, either. As the weekend progresses, ""Greg"" lurches from the frying pan to the fire, trashes a sentimental urn, get's stitched up by her brother ""Denny"" (Jon Abrahams) and I think if it'd been me, I'd have abandoned ship however much I might have loved the woman. Danner always manages to impose herself gently in comedy, her facial expressions and demeanour adding an approving or disapproving look that speaks volumes, and here she works well with De Niro whose controlling behaviour is really the source of much of the humour here. It's not laugh out loud funny, and there's far too much dialogue, but when De Niro is at his most controllingly mischievous, then this is worth a watch. Who doesn't like a bit of Peter, Paul & Mary too?",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
I've seen this before...,"In real life. There is something about Meet the Parents that usually leaves you thinking ""I've lived through this before"". Everyone I saw this with could relate at one point or another with Greg, which made the humor so effective. You get to care so much about the main character because you actually feel you could have been at one time or another him.I? Well, a parent of an ex-girlfriend of mine was a criminologist. You can imagine how hard I laughed during the ""interrogation"" scene.If you have ever dated someone, you owe to yourself to watch this movie. It's hilarious, and Robert de Niro and Ben Stiller won't disappoint you. What a chemistry!",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Best Film Of The Decade So Far,"This so far is the greatest film of the decade, it is great.Robert De Niro I personally would of thought he would have been too serious an actor for this film but was a great person to have as Jack Byrnes.Ben Stiller also was a great asset to the film although the name Gay Lord Focker is a bit over the top because i assume very few people would in their right mind would call their child Gay Lord and those few have a very small chance of being blessed with the surname Focker that was the only thing i could find wrong with the movie.The supporting cast did a very good job as well Teri Polo as Pamela Martha Byrnes soon to be Focker(ha ha) Blythe Danner as Dina Byrnes, Owen Wilson as Kevin(Pam's ex but what seems to be like Jacks best pal)and many more make up a good cast for an even better film!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

The funniest Gay Focker i have ever seen!,Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro come up trumps with this very funny movie about a male nurse who wants to marry his girlfriend but finds out he needs to get her fathers permission. They go to her parents house and that is where the fun starts. Robert De Nero is definately getting a lot better at comedy and in this he is very funny as an ex CIA over protective father. There are many funny scenes in this film including the Cat and the Urn sketch and the airport scenes and Ben Stiller carries them off to perfection. Very enjoyable. 8 out of 10.,8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Ben Stiller in a good movie?! There's a first time for everything.,"Meet The Parents is an excellent comedy, despite the fact that the casting director was not the most brilliant person in the world. A lot of the material in the film was clichéd or simply not creative, such as the fact that Greg's (Stiller) luggage obviously got lost, but the film as a whole is an excellent and very entertaining comedy. Robert DeNiro is horribly miscast as the overprotective father, but he is such a good actor that he makes his performance in the role work very effectively. He didn't get to really be the startlingly effective tough guy that he is so famous for, but at least he was introduced in a domineering low angle shot, as he looks down at Greg and Pam from his bedroom window (a very smart move by the film's director).Ben Stiller plays the part of the charmingly named Greg Focker, who wants to marry his girlfriend but has to earn the approval of her parents first. His name is bad enough, but he has to constantly explain his job as a nurse, a profession which provides him little to no respect from Pam's family. The majority of the film relates the events of the weekend spent at Pam's parents house, and everything imaginable goes wrong for him. The thing that makes this movie so funny is the well-written script and the way that some of the actors deliver their lines, particularly Robert DeNiro. The casting director deserves little to no credit for DeNiro's quality performance, but he just did such a good job in an uncharacteristic performance that he really steals the show. Some of the situations and especially the dialogue in this movie are destined to become classic lines  `Not many men in your profession, are there, Greg?' `I have nipples, could you milk me?' And, of course, there is the hilarious way that DeNiro constantly calls Greg `Focker' or, in at least one instance, `Greg R.N.'Meet The Parents is a film that a surprisingly wide variety of people can enjoy. Meeting the parents is a part of relationships that the vast majority of men go through, and this can either be a smooth or devastating experience, so they can relate to what goes on in this film. Also, the point of view of the woman whose parents are being met is thoroughly presented, so the female audience will not feel left out at all. Even parents can enjoy this movie, because what parents don't worry about their kids and their dating experiences? Some of the situations may go a little too far, I mean, it's not very often that an eligible bachelor meets his girlfriend's parents and nearly burns their house to the ground, and it's a little excessive that EVERYthing goes wrong, not just a lot of things, but the comedy is so good that these excessive things are okay.Ben Stiller is actually a good choice to play the role of Greg Focker, because he is such an annoying actor that it is very effective in the way that he gets all of Pam's family and friends to hate him. He makes a good scapegoat, and his unfortunate luck produces a good portion of the comedy in this film. But it is DeNiro, above all, who makes this such a good movie. He is cast strongly against type, but Meet The Parents is still a very well-made comedy that is just a lot of fun.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Does funny mean stupid?,"I enjoyed this film. DeNiro, Stiller, Danner, all were quite funny in working with the screenplay. I just had to wonder, though, during that really slow part near the end, why American comedies tend toward making their characters seem incredibly shallow and stupid. The more shallow and stupid these characters seemed, the less funny the film became. Direct correlation in my opinion.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The worst movie ever.,"OK before i talk about this i have to say that there will be two spoilers and those two spoilers are the only two 'jokes' in this thing we call a movie. How anybody can find this torturous thing entertaining or humorous in any way shape or form baffles me.The first o so funny joke the seemingly 10 year old writers throw at us is our main characters name being GAYLORD FOCKER. I would nearly consider forgiving the movie this joke if it was never brought up again and the movie went on to even being a pretty good family comedy but sadly no. What is funny about it?, because it sounds like a curse word maybe....No still not laughing. If you have not watched this movie yet and you wonder whats the big deal about one stupid little joke well the answer is that they use it about 20 times during this 90 minute horror. It was not funny the first time, it most certainly wasn't funny the second time and guess what it isn't funny the 20th time either.Amazingly though that is not what wreaks the movie no that would be our second joke. When i say joke this time it is actually more of an scenario rather than a run of the mill scene, this is of course awkwardness (if that makes any sense). The situations that our main character gets himself into are always the same awkward situations time and time again. Of course meeting your girlfriends or wife's mother and father will feel weird at first but for god sake. There isn't one shot in this movie that doesn't involve our main character(stiller) making a complete fool of himself, it gets to the point where its almost hard to watch the rest of the movie. This makes the movie uncomfortable and boring and also makes you hate stiller or should i say Gaylord.Having the audience hate the main character in a comedy is unforgivable. The casting is pretty standard having Stiller (who is very hit and miss in a lot of his films) as our main guy with Robert De Niro who continues to destroy his once gracious career as the spiteful father. Teri Polo plays Stillers girlfriend but she seems to have forgot that people are meant to have personalities and a little acting ability. As for the rest well none really stand out except for the always unfunny Owen Wilson as the successful ex-boyfriend.Its not as if this is completely meant for kids either because there are some jokes that kids wouldn't understand this begs the question do the film makers actually think that adults will find this garbage amusing. I would almost go as far as calling the movie insulting as it is obviously meant for fools which you are if you find this good to watch.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very disappointing.,"I was looking forward to this movie because of the talent of Ben Stiller and Robert DeNiro.  Unfortunately, the only funny parts of this movie are in the trailer.  I hate it when that happens!The jokes about the last name of Stiller's character start wearing thin very early in the show.  I admit there were scenes that I laughed at, but most of the funny parts were predictable.Both DeNiro and Stiller will be in good films in the future, unfortunately this isn't one of them.I give this film a 4 out of 10.",,Anonymous,Romance
This was a really fun movie!,"I very rarely find myself going to comedies. Most are either geared for teenie boppers or as dumb as a bag of hammers. This film was somewhat refreshing. It had a neat story and great performances. DeNiro and Stiller are perfect together and I am glad to hear that they are considering a sequel to this film. If only Ben could talk his father (Jerry Stiller) into signing up for it, that would be a heck of a good time. This movie is not rocket science and I think some critics have dogged it as a result. However, that is silly. If you want to see two great actors battle each other for 90 minutes, you cannot do better than this film.

Hilarious comedy will keep you in stitches.,"Robert DeNiro is developing into quite an entertaining comedic actor. In his latest comic opus, which he also produced, he is the future father-in-law of Greg Focker (Ben Stiller).  Greg's girlfriend, Pam (Teri Polo) has brought him home to `Meet the Parents'. From the moment he drives up to the front door nothing goes right. Jay Roach (Austin Powers) has ably directed his actors getting just the right combination of humor and character without being too slapsticky.Unfortunately, the trailer gives away many of the film's best gags. However, the characters are likeable so that you sympathize with their plight. Blythe Danner is the future mother-in-law and isn't given much to do. Of course, the end of the story seems to lead to the possible sequel, `Meet the Fockers,' Greg's parents. Who would be better to play them than Ben Stiller's own folks, Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara.

Maybe very funny,"This could well be a pretty good comedy, I definitely giggled at a few moments, but sadly saw it seven hours into a long haul flight and wasn't really in the best mood to enjoy it. De Niro's so-called self parody role wears a little thin, mostly composed of him gurning every now and then, and Ben Stiller repeats his useless tit act from Something About Mary and Flirting with Disaster, while the rest of the cast mostly dither around in the background (apart from ..Owen Wilson.. as Stiller's rival, his girl's ex, who tears up some scenery with a good over-the-top camp act), but basically it's situation and slapstick, with a fair old whack of toilet humour thrown in.

He glowers, or makes sarcastic remarks to Stiller and is constantly hilarious. Stiller, have perfected the nervous guy routine in THERE' SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, brings this character to a new level.

Anyway, Gaylord ""Greg"" Focker(Stiller) is a nurse that wants to propose to his girlfriend Pam Byrnes(Polo) but first must meet her parents. When he gets there, her father Jack(DeNiro) obviously doesn't like him, which is basically the entire movie. Blythe Danner plays DeNiro's wife and is normal acting, but very good in her role. After Greg already makes Pam's family hate him, her ex-boyfriend Kevin Rawley(Wilson) comes over and tells intimate secrets to Greg. Nicole Dehuff plays Pam's newlywed sister and in real life died recently of pneumonia(she was in her early 30's).my rating-A-94%. rated PG-13 for sexual humor, drug content and language. 111 minutes.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
It's funny enough.,"Awkward humor has never been my cup of tea, but in ""Meet the Parents,"" the two leads have such great chemistry that it makes the awkwardness somewhat bearable. Ben Stiller has a couple of great scenes to himself, but it's Robert De Niro in a memorable role that gets most of the credit. This is one of the best parts he's played in years, and most of the humor stems from his character.

I found myself feeling sorry for Ben Stiller, more than laughing at him.  His antics through the film were cliched and generally not funny. It was more like the director was going, ""Let's see how many times he can get everyone to hate his guts in an hour and a half, and then we'll make it all better!""

Much ado about very little.,"After all the hype and great box office I was really expecting to be wowed by this movie  I was not.There are some funny lines and good acting by a good cast but over all it felt like a much longer movie than its 107 minute runtime  Frankly, I was bored through most of it.Probably because, even though Ben Stiller did a good job of playing Greg (Gaylord) Focker, I just couldn't relate to him  and it is important for you (the audience) to be able to relate to his situation in order to laugh at the predicament(s) he gets himself into.At one point Jack Byrnes (Robert De Niro) asks Greg if he trusts people and then makes the assertion that you can't trust any one.' So basically, Greg should have taken his cue from what Jack said and simply not trusted anyone or the situations that presented themselves to him.The only real message here is that lying doesn't work and compounding your lies with even more lies will only dig you deeper into a hole.This is a lesson that Greg doesn't learn until the very end of the movie  and even then you aren't sure he has really learned the lesson.Blythe Danner is her usual beautiful self and does a good job of playing the too-good-to-be-true' wife of the neurotic Jack.Owen Wilson, who just did a stellar turn in `Shanghai Noon,' is pretty much unbelievable as the goody-two-shoes that was Pam Byrnes' (Teri Polo) former fiancé. No one is that white-bread.Teri Polo is not an actress I am familiar with  but I want to see more of her.  She was very appealing as the daughter of a wildly dysfunctional family.This is a movie that you should wait to see at home on video so you can fast forward through the slow parts  you won't miss a thing.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Don't expect ""Mary""","At $165 Million, this film was number seven at the box office for 2000. Though it is funny in parts, as is often the case with blockbusters I am left scratching my head at its runaway popularity.  Comparisons with `There's Something About Mary' are unavoidable.  Ben Stiller plays the same kind of sincere but hapless character in each film and they both have a wry and offbeat presentation.  However, the humor in this film is far more lowbrow than `Mary'.  It is also highly predictable.  The least perceptive of viewers can see the outcome of each gag a mile away.I suppose there is an element of identification with the premise, since most people remember their own consternation at the big meeting with the parents of their beloved.  Perhaps the appeal of the film is that we love to laugh at people who are more luckless than we are, and Greg (Ben Stiller) clearly has no equal when it comes to the bad luck he has in this film.Ben Stiller is fast establishing himself as one of the most accomplished Sad Sacks in film today.  He portrays characters with such sincerity and misfortune that you can't help but love him.  In this film, he continues that tradition with an outstanding performance as Greg.  Robert De Niro, who is a great dramatic actor, continues his recent trend away from serious drama and toward offbeat comedy roles (`Flawless', `Analyze This', `Rocky and Bullwinkle').  Although his very presence in films like this is comical due to its incongruity, he is not a particularly good comedian.  I'm looking forward to seeing him in his latest film `Fifteen Minutes' which is a more serious dramatic role better suited to his enormous talent.  I was very impressed with Teri Polo, who played Pam.  She has genuineness and an affable nature that is well suited for romantic comedy.This is a good comedy, but nowhere near as good as the box office would lead us to believe.  I rated it a 7/10.  It is a fun flick with absurdly exaggerated humor and numerous belly laughs, but don't expect it to be as good as `Mary'.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Somewhat above average, lukewarm","There were moments in this film when I was moved to laugh or feel genuine empathy for the characters. I think that's the most positive remark I can make. I felt a lot of the humor was of the tedious unfortunate-misunderstanding-or-miscommunication variety.Also, I don't think Robert DeNiro turns in the performance he usually does. For the most part, though, he and the rest of the cast make it work. I never really felt everything come together here the way it has in other movies involving Ben Stiller or DeNiro.Having said that, I'm glad I saw it, and it's probably better than a lot of what is out there.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Meet the Parents: extremely funny,"'Meet the Parents' is a brilliant take on a young man who goes to visit his girlfriend's parents for the first time.

They are strange themselves - the overbearing secret agent father, the druggie brother, the cat that can flush the toilet, and so on. The intentions of the young man are good, but he keeps getting himself into messes and more messes by attempting to do the right thing. This film is funny on many different levels, and I think that it can appeal to a wide audience because of the different types of humour shown. I do not care much for romantic comedy films, but this one had me laughing.

A Hilarious and Adult-Friendly Comedy,"Meet the Parents is a comedic gem that had me laughing out loud from start to finish. This delightful film is a perfect choice for a lighthearted evening of entertainment, but be prepared for some mature humor that may not be suitable for younger audiences.The movie follows the story of Greg Focker (played by Ben Stiller), a hapless nurse who finds himself in a series of hilariously awkward situations when he meets his girlfriend's parents for the first time. The script is sharp and witty, delivering a barrage of clever one-liners and situational comedy that keeps the audience engaged throughout.Ben Stiller's comedic timing is impeccable, bringing his signature brand of physical comedy and awkward charm to the role of Greg. He masterfully portrays the character's desperation and anxiety, making him instantly relatable and endearing.Robert De Niro, in the role of the stern and overprotective father, provides the perfect foil to Stiller's comedic antics. Their on-screen chemistry is fantastic, generating genuine laughs as their characters clash in a series of comical misunderstandings.The supporting cast, including Teri Polo and Blythe Danner, adds depth and humor to the story, elevating the overall comedic experience. The performances are consistently strong, with each actor delivering their comedic lines with impeccable timing.Meet the Parents successfully manages to find humor in relatable situations, poking fun at the universal experience of meeting the in-laws. The film's humor ranges from witty banter to slapstick moments, ensuring a diverse array of laughs for the audience.While the film's humor is undoubtedly its strongest aspect, it's worth noting that some of the jokes and innuendos may not be suitable for younger viewers. It's a comedy that caters to an adult audience, providing humor that may be appreciated more by those who have experienced the challenges and awkwardness of meeting the parents.In conclusion, Meet the Parents is a highly entertaining and funny comedy that will leave you in stitches. Ben Stiller's comedic genius, coupled with a strong ensemble cast and a script filled with clever humor, make it a must-watch for adult audiences seeking a good laugh. Just be sure to leave the kids at home for this one!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Meet the Parents: 8/10,"I remember wanting to see this ever since the first trailer came out. I eagerly went to the movie theater on the evening with a friend who had come from Washington, and I was so disappointed when the showing, and the next one, was sold out. When I saw it about a couple weeks later, I understood why it had.Meet the Parents starts off with Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) saying a love-speech to a patient in the hospital where he nurses, to see how it sounds for his pop of the question later in the day. When a funny turn of events make him not say the speech, his girlfriend Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo) is taking him to meet her parents before proposing.Greg obviously is nervous, and meeting Jack (Robert De Nero), Pam's dad, doesn't do anything to help. Robert De Nero has a knack for comedy, which seems to be his main thing nowadays. He's very good as the perceptive and yet naive father of teacher Pam.Blythe Danner, who is underused in the movie, plays Jack's loving wife, Dina, who likes Greg and doesn't like Jack digging so deep into Pam's boyfriend's lives. Greg gives the Byrnes a gift-a rare plant. Pam had told Greg that Jack was a retired florist; what Greg doesn't know is that Jack is actually a retired CIA agent, which makes sense, since Jack is less than thrilled at the gift. It's obvoius that Jack doesn't approve of Greg, but Dina and Pam tell him to take it easy on Greg. Yeah, right.Pam's sister, Deborah (Nicole DeHuff), is getting married to Dr. Bob Banks (Thomas McCarthy) in the Byrnes homestead while Jack is living there. Do you think the wedding will go flawless? One of the only things I don't like about Meet the Parents is that it has too many seconday characters, like Dr. Bob's father, Dr. Larry (James Rebhorn) and Bob's mother, Linda (Phyllis George). But if you don't really pay attention to those people (although they're needed later in the movie), it works better.As more and more mishaps happen by Greg, Jack more and more dislikes him. He pains to like, or at least tolerate, Greg for the women's sakes, but it's tough. Luckily he's got hidden cameras around the house to look at him 24-7. Why is it so funny? Because it's by the director of the Austin Powers series, Jay Roach. Although Meet the Parents doesn't have the randiness of Austin Powers, it still holds some laughs.Overall, Meet the Parents is a very funny movie that doesn't lack on plot and doesn't stoop to the Austin Powers level. The supporting characters leave something to be desired, but that doesn't even dent the otherwise wonderful and comedic movie that we have here.My rating: 8/10Rated PG-13 for language, sexual humor, and drug refrences/content.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Maybe the funniest movie I've ever seen,"Not too much to say except see this movie! Not at all crude or disgusting like some recent popular movies yet so much better. Ben Stiller is a comic genius and this is just further proof. Robert D. is great as the father of the girlfriend...the whole ensemble seemed perfectly cast right down to the cat. No need to say what it's about since the tag line does that but I must say again, see this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Amazing Movie,Meet the Parents has to be one of the best movies ever created in the history of the cinema. It got me laughing in the first 10 minutes of the movie and I always die laughing when that cat pees in the grandma's ashes. The whole movie and every character in it was hilarious and Robert de Niro was an excellent father in that he was always overprotective of his daughter and would always nitpick everything Greg did like most father-in-laws-to-be would. Greg was funny in that he was very loving toward Pam and was EXTREMELY jealous of her old boyfriend Kevin. That stewardess lady was hilarious because she was such a pain to Greg and the sticks and the BOMB BOMB BOMB was funny until 9/11 but still is sort of funny. All in all I give this movie a 10 but I wish to give it more but regrettably I cannot! EXCELLENTE!,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not one actor has a sense of comedy.  Miss this movie!,"The best thing about this movie is that it ended!  Don't see this movie! It is not a comedy; it is a tragedy: Not one of the main characters has a sense of comedy.  In addition, the jokes are contrived and the dialogue is embarrassingly poor.Robert De Niro is not a comedian.  He plays violent parts, e.g., Goodfellas, Godfather, Cape Fear, etc.  If De Niro's next meal depended on making people laugh he would die of starvation.  So why was he cast in a main role?  The answer is simple: De Niro is one of the producers!  (Always look for the role that 'filthy lucre"" plays in a movie.)Ben Stiller has ambitions to be a comedian.  Sorry, Ben, your talent lies elsewhere.  This movie is a continuation of another mediocre performance that Stiller gave in the comedy ""Keeping the Faith"".  Ben, try drama; comedies are not for you.The only bright moment in the whole movie was the actress Kali Rocha who appeared as a flight attendant for a few minutes towards the end of the movie.  I hope she gets another opportunity to act in a comedy.  She seems to have that special gift of comic timing but her role was too short to tell for sure. Certainly no other actor in ""Meet the Parents"" had any sense of comic timing.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great comedy with Stiller and DeNiro on top form,"Meet the Parents showcases the most horrible meeting of your in laws ever. Practically everything goes wrong for our protagonist. And watching him sink deeper and deeper is much of the fun of this comedy. A great script and perfect performances from Stiller and especially DeNiro as the father in law from hell.

One of the best comedies of the millennium,"When I first heard about this pairing coming together for this movie, I was pretty excited. Even though he's starting to bug me now, Ben Stiler is one of the best comedy actors of the last 15 years. Put him together with in my opinion the best actor ever in DeNiro, and give them a half decent script, and hilarity should follow. DeNiro has done some terrible comedies, most notably the ""Analyse This"" series, two movies based around a ""emotionally fragile"" mafia boss. C'mon! ""Meet the Parents"" focuses on Greg (Stiller) and girlfriend Pam going to see Pam's parents in the hope of softening them up for a marriage proposal. Greg is understandably nervous and when a few things start going wrong, he begins to break. The movie is full of brilliant one liners, sight gags, tragedy gags and lots more. Most of it is based around some dark or unlikely events which nonetheless have you in stitches. There's also a fine cameo by Owen Wilson, playing Pam's ex.The teaming of DeNiro and Stiller works brilliantly and this has to be one of the great comedies of the 2000's.WARNING: Do not see the sequel to this ""Meet The Parents 2"" under any circumstances. It is a pure cash in on the first and very little effort went into the script. One of the worst sequels ever. I think I laughed twice.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Its a story of a wimp with a pathetic girl friend,"The girl friend in the movie is absolutely class A pathetic.

Her ex fiance has her photos all over the place, humiliates him with a lousy swim suit, she is fine with that. She is somehow in her exs team and cant play on the team with her bf where her family humiliates him while playing pool volleyball, but that is fine.But him spray painting a cat is where she draws the line?!

Could Be The Perfect Comedy,"How do you make a good first impression on and win over your prospective father-in-law on the very weekend you intend to ask for his first-born daughter's hand in marriage?  A tricky, touchy, very delicate and serious situation that must be faced and addressed by a young man in `Meet The Parents,' a hilarious comedy directed by Jay Roach and starring Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller.  Greg (Stiller) is in love; he knows Pam (Teri Polo) is the one he wants to spend the rest of his life with, and is ready to propose.  But certain circumstances clue him in to the fact that he should meet her parents first, approach her father, Jack (De Niro), and make the formal request, thereby extending him the respect he has come to understand Jack demands.  Plans are made, and the weekend begins with the flight from Chicago to New York.  And when a slight problem arises even before they board their plane, Greg should have seen it as an omen, because after that, absolutely nothing seems to go as planned. He finds Pam's mom, Dina (Blythe Danner), fairly accessible, but Jack turns out to be quite the formidable opponent, and from the minute they meet it becomes one long dance and spar of witticisms and revelations that make this one weekend Greg (and the audience) will never forget. 	What makes this movie so funny (and this IS one funny movie) is that the humor is character driven, situational and all very real; the laughs (and there are plenty) are all earned and are derived from inherently comical events and circumstances.  The ongoing banter between Greg and Jack is clever, the dialogue is superb and delivered with such sly and subtle shadings that it rings true at every turn.  And De Niro and Stiller play off of one another so perfectly and with such impeccable timing that it's like watching art come to life.  Stiller is a master at playing comedy dead-pan straight, and De Niro proves to be his equal here.  They never go after cheap laughs, and what little broad humor Roach employs evolves directly from the story and is never gratuitous or overdone; Roach and his cast let it all flow naturally and play it with a seriousness that makes it all the more hilarious.  You can literally feel Greg's pain and discomfort as he tries in vain to stand tall and impress this intimidating figure of a man he hopes will soon be his own father-in-law.  And De Niro makes Jack everything a suitor dreads in a prospective in-law; he doesn't merely scratch the surface of this character, but goes deep to make him a multi-layered personality, enigmatic and hard to read.  You know instinctively that there's more to this guy than meets the eye, and given the fact that nobody is good enough in his eyes for his little girl, he is a nightmare waiting for any and all `Gregs' that may come a-calling. 	Polo is charming as Pam; she's charismatic, has great screen presence and a winning personality that makes her character likable and totally believable. In a supporting role, Owen Wilson gives a stand-out performance as Pam's ex-boyfriend, Kevin; he so wryly underplays him, and what he does contrasts so well with what De Niro and Stiller are doing that it makes him one of the most memorable characters in the film.  Rounding out the excellent supporting cast are Nicole DeHuff (Debbie), Jon Abrahams (Denny), James Rebhorn (Larry) and Phyllis George (Linda).  With `Meet The Parents,' Roach leaves no doubt as to what he can do with a comedy; this film is filled with truly funny, memorable scenes and has an endless number of quotable lines, the best of which belongs to Jack (spoken to Greg ):  `If I find that you are trying to corrupt my first born child, I will bring you down, baby, I will bring you down to Chinatown'  In the final analysis, it's all a lot of fun, and there are many things here with which many viewers will readily identify.  This movie, in fact, may well be the perfect comedy; certainly it is nothing less than a modern-day classic that you do not want to miss.  I rate this one 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Hilarious, Entertaining Comedy Hit","""Meet The Parents"" succeeds marvelously at the hands of two brilliant, engaging comic actors, Ben Stiller and Robert DeNiro, period. Their amusing collaboration as would-be in-laws is nothing short of absolutely convincing and flat out hilarious! From the moment Greg is introduced to the intimidating Byrnes family, he is enthralled by every snare, every ridicule, and every miserable catastrophe that is inevitable to befriend this ""critical acquaintance"". Talk about the desire to impress your fiancé's family going horribly, miserably wrong! It seems that every possible mistake, every possible ""gotcha"", and every possible ""slip of the tongue"" conceived by man befalls the hapless Greg, and all he set out to do was leave a good impression to his future in-laws. This is such a hilarious premise to begin with, but the execution is bounds and beyond what you might expect in a comedy such as this. The acrimony and uneasiness between Stiller and DeNiro is so convincing, so apparent, and so amusing that they work as a team to virtually steal the show! You just couldn't imagine any other pair of actors collaborating so effectively and so hilariously in a comedy such as this, and Stiller and DeNiro are the real reasons to watch this film. All I can say is, I can't wait until their next outrageous outing in the upcoming ""Meet the Fockers""; I can't see how the sequel can surpass such a hilarious and amusing film as this. From the polygraph tests, to the catastrophe with DeNiro's mother's ashes, to the striping of the cat, to the mishap with Stiller's name ""Gaylord Focker"", this is one classic comedy of misadventures, brilliant comic collaboration, and an ingenious barrel of genuine laughs! **** out of ****",,Anonymous,Romance

"Awful, Awful","This film is an uneven mess.  It is funny for about 10-15 minutes at the beginning, and for maybe 45 seconds (possibly two minutes) at the end.  The rest of the film is a horrible monstrosity.After the initial, fifteen minutes (I'll be generous), the film suddenly falls in love with its gross-out comedy.  It began as a kinda strange, funny film about characters.  There's unspoken tension between Stiller and DeNiro, and it was very funny.  Then the film becomes a slapstick gross out mess of a film, and the jokes were seen miles away.  The tragedy is that even when they're being set up we already know they will not be funny, so when they are finally delivered, we completely hate them.At around the midpoint, you find the film too absurd to be taken seriously, and from there it only gets worse.  The characters are so uneven and poorly written that you don't even really care what they say or do.Things get more and more absurd and less and less funny as the film goes on and on (and on and on). Clueless Director Jay Roach clearly had a vision for this film, but it's a shame his crew didn't share the same vision.  It's obvious that no one knew what the hell they were doing in this atrocity besides the director.  And it's the irony of ironies that this happens to be one of the worst American directors working today.This film is much, much worse than those Austin Powers films Roach directed, and I think that's saying quite a lot. In fact-Wait, wait, what the hell am I doing writing this review?  Why am I still typing?  This film is awful-stay away!  It doesn't even deserve my time in writing a decent review.  If they didn't put that much effort into their film, why should I put that much effort into this?",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Expecting laughs... where were they?,"I was really hoping to see a good movie, but it was just painful to watch. Oh, there were a few chuckles here and there but for the most part those were sight gags.And while I had no problems with the acting, the characters lacked humor -- in the case of the ""parents"", literally, since we were warned about that. But why are we supposed to laugh at people who don't get a joke?  And who are rude?  (Aside from being completely disinterested in Greg's gift, they don't even feign appreciation or say ""thank you."")The fiance is extremely thoughtless in having her ex-fiance an integral part of the weekend without telling Greg.The ex-fiance and the other associated family are rich, pretentious snobs who get their laughs making fun of Greg's real name.To top it all off, with the weekend off to such a bad start from the beginning, Greg sinks to embarrassing stupidity in some of his actions, namely regarding the imposter cat.Pass on this one.

"Funny the first time, but second viewing upsets the viewer.","When I first saw MEET THE PARENTS, I thought it was a riot, I kept on laughing at the continuous comedy of errors. But, when I watched it for a second time, hoping I would laugh as hard as the first time, I was kind of p*ssed off the way Ben Stiller's character is blamed for everything, especially when you know how the film turns out. It is a little annoying.So, the first time I saw this, I loved it, the second time, I grew to dislike it a little bit. The cast is great, starring Robert De Niro, Ben Stiller of THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, Teri Polo, Blythe Danner, James Rebhorn, Jon Abrahams, and Owen Wilson.But, I can also relate to the film in many ways, since I know a lot of people that compare to those in the film.I think the film is a major riot, but also a way to majorly upset someone. If you are the kind of person who finds it funny to blame stuff on innocent people, then you will love this movie. I did the first time and I still enjoy watching it from time to time. Just not for a way to spend free-time. See it when you have nothing better to do. MEET THE PARENTS gets 4/5.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

A great Ben Stiller comedy,"Ben Stiller has shown throughout the years that he does great at starring in fun comedies, and this is no exception. Stiller stars as Greg Focker, a male nurse who is going to meet his girlfriend's parents for the weekend and ask her father for approval to marry Pam, the aforementioned girlfriend. Stiller creates a character that is hilarious, believable, and one that many can relate to.Robert De Niro steals the show as Jack Byrnes, a former CIA agent who is a nice guy but has strict rules. There are times when he suspects and knows that Greg is up to no good, but is accepting of who Greg is and isn't afraid to say anything. Jack likes to have fun but makes Greg nervous. Nobody can pull off the chemistry better than De Niro and Stiller do in these roles.Teri Polo plays Greg's girlfriend Pam and Blythe Danner plays Jack's wife Dina. They both do fine jobs but are not given a whole lot to do.Director Jay Roach takes an idea of what it'll be like to spend a weekend with a girlfriend's parents and makes an original story out of it. Roach is great at telling funny and heartfelt stories. Roach does an excellent job at getting the performances that he wants and is able to tell a good story.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Turkey Alert!!!,"This is, hands down, the worst movie Robert DeNiro has ever made.  The characters were uniformly cartoonish and unbelievable, the situations utterly predictable, and the humor (what little there is of it!) embarrassingly forced and juvenile.This is a movie that should have starred Pauly Shore and/or Adam Sandler. It's that bad!Towards the end of his career, Richard Burton let it be known that for a million-dollar fee, he'd appear in any movie without even reviewing the script...and that's how we got abominations like ""Exorcist II"" and ""The Klansman"".After suffering through ""Meet The Parents"", one has to wonder if DeNiro hasn't done something similar.",,Anonymous,Romance

I dedicate my next bowel movement to this film,"Well let's start off by saying that comedy cinema has been in troubling decline for about 10 years. It's all political correct, contrived, formulaic and worst of all, unfunny.In all my IMDb reviews, I have not rated one Ben Stiller film. All of them are pathetic (and guess what, there's something about mary was just as bad as the rest). Some fellow actors say he's so serious when he works and so many people think he's side-splitting. If you ask me, he is the most unfunny actor in the history of comedy and has a clear ability to pick the most pathetic scripts circling Hollywood.Him aside, this film is dreadful. It isn't funny and if you think it is, then I wonder what would happen if i put a flash light to your left ear. Would I see light coming out the right side? Let's look at some of the pathetic attempt at comedy used in this one.The character's surname is Focker. Gee that's funny (not). The screenwriters must have agonized for months before coming up with the idea of giving the main character a surname that they can milk about 1000 unfunny one-liners and jokes from. Then, after you think they milked that one for everything it's worth, a sequel emerges titled ""Meet the Fockers"", where the surname is giving rise to more material. Suffice to say that the sequel was worse than this, but I won't review it since I can't set the IMDb star rating into negative territory.Then they set up stupid and deeply contrived scenarios like Mr. Focker going through the brother's underwear draw. Gee, that one was funny and original..... NOT.After this, the writers obviously had to apply their intelligence as they must have realized that it was seriously lacking. So they ever so slightly raised the bar and tried to come up with the father-in-law from hell, even though that in itself is deeply clichéd. So they made him some sort of ex-CIA something or rather, with a lie detector in his basement so that the future son-in-law's sexual past can be probed.At this point, I actually felt embarrassed for Robert De Niro. Someone certainly must have called in a big favor to get him on-board this rubbish.Another pathetic protuberance along the downwardly-inclined road that is Hollywood comedy.And.... I've said it before so I'll say it again - I'm still waiting for a Ben Stiller film that I actually like.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Mediocre - like one long prank phone call...,"I bought this movie on strong recommendations from friends and couldn't wait to see it.  I wish that I had rented it instead.The entire movie was about this poor guy lying all the time to impress his girlfriend's father (Jack) but all he does is fumble, tell stupid lies and either get caught lying or make the lie is so ridiculous that EVERYONE knows he is lying.  I was actually uncomfortable watching some scenes because they were so tense (all you could do was wait for the foot to go deeper in his mouth, or maybe watch him change feet).  He would lie about ANYTHING if he thought that it would score points with Jack.  It was a celebration of idiocy and bad judgement.  I wanted wit and I got none from this movie.In all fairness, there were some funny scenes but they did not leave me laughing as hard as the first reviewer said she did.  They showed the funniest scene on the preview so we've all seen it.  If you are expecting another ""Something About Mary"", you will be disappointed.",,Anonymous,Romance

Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller have become the best one-two comedic punch in the business. This movie is the complete package, with great acting, storyline, and potential for a great sequel.

surprisingly stupid.,"i'm very surprised by all the good reviews this movie got.  this is not just a bad movie, it's a very stupid movie.i was actually very much looking forward to seeing it because the trailers (when it came out) made it look like a funny movie.it isn't.the premise is simple enough.  it's the same formula as ""animal house"" and any number of other such movies: one wacky circumstance after another.  a string of funny ""schticks.""but whereas ""animal house"" was indeed funny, this film was notably unfunny. in fact, it was tediously so.it looks to me like it was put together to take advantage of all the good hype ""something about mary"" and ""analyze this"" got.  those were also not particularly funny or well-made movies, but certainly not as bad or boring as this one.  at least those films gave the impression that somebody cared about them (and the audience watching them).this film showed its shortcomings early on and completely failed to hold my interest throughout. i'm still waiting for that promised belly laugh.still, with all the good reviews it got here, there clearly is an audience for films such as this.  which is why it got made, i suppose.i'd rather not think about what that means. .5/10(that's POINT 5 out of 10)(a particularly low rating because this film actually insults the intelligence)note:  if you find this review in any way offensive, you will probably enjoy ""meet the parents"" and should probably rent and enjoy it.  if you do not find this review offensive, don't bother with this turkey and rent something like ""being john malkovich"" instead.",,Anonymous,Romance

There was a lot of laughing - and some by me. The movie had enjoyable characters and some entertaining circumstances.However, it had a couple serious flaws. In the first place the beginning and end were good - very easily 8 caliber. The middle 45 minutes or so, however were difficult to watch. The torture that Matt Damon had to go through was actually painful - not funny.Also, the biases that the other characters had against his character were unreasonable and unbelievable.

"One of, if not, the funniest movies of 2000!","""Meet the Parents"" was a hilarious movie.  One of the reasons is because it was well casted.  Ben Stiller, everything bad happens to him, he's intimidated and insulted constantly: is that not what you think of when you think of Ben Stiller, in movies like ""There's Something About Mary.""  Robert Deniro, mysterious, seemingly conniving, an over-all sense of intimidation and violence: is that also not what you think of when you hear his name.If you like movies where bad things constantly happen to someone, like in ""The Big Lebowski,"" you'll like this movie.  This movie is full of great scenes as well as great lines.  Greg Focker has to be the most unlucky character in movie history.  All this bad stuff happens to him although he's completely innocent.  And the movies not just a bunch of situations with bad stuff happening to Ben Stiller, it has a good ending that ties together the whole movie and makes all the bad stuff worth while.This is a great date movie if you're sick of all that genuine romance stuff!  Enjoy!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The best comedy there is,This is a humorous romance comedy. I like this movie especially because it feels different every time I watch it. The jokes are still funny and relevant.

Great Comedy that Hits Home,"Greg (Ben Stiller) is having a horrible day.  The airline loses his luggage and he has to meet his girlfriend's parents.

As we watch Greg's downfall, we can't help but laugh and feel sympathy for him. Every thing he does goes wrong while he's only trying to impress his girlfriend's parents.

Why I can't watch Gomer Pyle,"First things first: I WANTED to see this film. I think Ben Stiller is a hoot and De Niro is an excellent actor who is perfect for this material. De Niro did not disappoint and Stiller was exactly right for his role. Everyone was well-cast.So, then, why did this movie stink?I'll start by saying, I can't watch ""Gomer Pyle, USMC"". It's not that I don't like Jim Nabors; it's just that the show is about how Gomer always does things that are painfully and blatantly obviously STUPID and WRONG. Gomer asks out Sgt. Carter's girlfriend because the Sarge has to work in town and Gomer doesn't want her to feel lonely; then Sarge sees Gomer and goes on the rampage. Well, DUH. Nobody would do anything so stupid unless they really wanted to pursue the girlfriend. It's painful because I see it coming a mile away.Ben Stiller plays the Gomer Pyle role in this film. DeNiro is superb as the suspicious and unapproachable father in the Sergeant Carter mold. Stiller's character does so many things that are so STUPID and WRONG that you wonder how he could have survived to adulthood. I don't want to give anything away, but you and I and everyone else in the world knows that you don't try to ""replace"" a highly trained animal with one you found at the pound! Well, DUH! You see everything in this movie coming - a mile away.At least Gomer Pyle was only a half hour long. I kept wanting to get up and leave but several members of my family were along and I couldn't very well leave them there. At least I was treated, at the very end of the film, to a fantastically hilarious airline subplot that really made my wait mostly worthwhile. Every time I am in a situation with obvious airline morons in the future, you know that I'll be thinking, ""Step Off!""4/10 stars, only because the acting was terrific.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Truly Brilliant Comedy,"Meet The Parents is one of those comedy films that really does live up to its reputation.Ben Stiller is always at his best when he is playing a more relatable, realistic character than his goofier turns in films like Zoolander and Dodgeball, so he makes for a very enjoyable lead in this.The rest of the cast are top tier. Robert De Niro really is the master of all trades, nailing the comedy flawlessly.I love the plot.

Absolutely a Riot!,"Meet the Parents is the funniest movie of the year, no questions asked! Robert DeNiro and Ben Stiller are absolutely HILARIOUS! I knew I would love this movie from the very beginning.This movie works on so many levels. Not only is the movie absolutely hilarious from start to finish, it also has a lot of sad and touching elements. Ben Stiller is great as the unfortunately named Greg Focker (who does resemble his character in There's Something About Mary a little too much) and Robert DeNiro is fantastic as Jack Byrnes, a would-be father-in-law from Hell. DeNiro is much better in this movie than his terrible role in the atrocious Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle simply because he is more relaxed and has much more fun with this character. Stiller and DeNiro make such a good team in this movie, also. Both of them make the perfect reactions to all the absolutely humiliating mishaps Greg does in the movie. All the horrible things Greg does, from losing DeNiro's dear cat to breaking a girl's nose to setting the house on fire, none of them would have been as funny as they were if DeNiro didn't do such a good job reacting to the accidents when he would find out about them. And some of the scenes (Greg saying grace at the dinner table and the fabulous interrogation scenes) are absolutely IMPOSSIBLE not to scream out laughing.And although the movie does have a little too much in common with There's Something About Mary, it still has all new laughs that are very fresh and are absolutely a riot!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

This could have been a classic comedy, with a good cast (including one of my favourite comedy actors, Ben Stiller) great plot idea, big budget, experienced director, etc., but the script was obviously written by a retarded 3 year old undergoing toilet training.

I just don't think it's funny to watch Ben Stiller struggle through a weekend trying to get along with his parents as the movie and the script have already made it impossible for him to do so. Robert DeNiro is one of my favorite actors. He is a very likeable guy even playing a hard-nosed father-in-law. He does a very good job doing comedy, I'd like to see him do it a lot more, but the movie just isn't as funny as everyone thinks it is.

Like all Hollywood flicks, there is a happy ending.  Nonetheless, I don't think he got the revenge or justice he deserved for all the crap he had to endure.

Such a disappointment,"`Meet The Parents'It was the idea of my son's partner that we see this comedy as a family (perhaps she's trying to tell me something?), but it was a real disappointment to us all. It may have done brilliantly in the United States, but I found the plot slight and the humour forced.  We know from `Analyze This' that Robert De Niro can do comedy and we know from `There's Something About Mary' that Ben Stiller has a wicked way with domestic animals, but neither De Niro as the anally-retentive potential father-in-law nor Stiller as the earnest but unfortunate suitor of de Niro's daughter can overcome an inadequate script with too few real laughs.

I thought the story was excellent because there is so much you can do with this type of story. Meeting the parents is not an easy thing to do and a lot of things can go wrong during that visit.

Some of it is funny,"Some of this movie is very funny, but most of it is just plain cruel and doesn't deserve a chuckle.  Ben Stiller plays Greg, the soon-to-be fiance of Pam (Teri Polo), who's just meeting her parents for the first time.  Her parents, especially her father (Robert De Niro), not only reject him, they treat him like a piece of unwanted garbage.  Personally, I would have just walked out after the first five minutes with the parents and never would have seen her again.  I wouldn't WANT to marry into a family as arrogant as that.  But anyway, Greg spends an entire weekend with the in-laws where NOTHING goes right for him.  This is an obvious take on the the first sequence of ""There's Something About Mary"".  It's wasn't remotely funny in ""Mary"", and it doesn't work here either.  If you have the mentality of a 12 to 16-year-old, you may enjoy it.  But for the rest of us, it just tries too hard to be funny.  It doesn't flow very well, and most of the situations don't make a lot of sense.

It had me laughing all the way, from beginning, the hospital ""practice marriage"" all the way to the end! This story directed By Jay Roach (Who directed Austin powers 1 & 2) is original and hilarious. It revolves around Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) who wants to marry Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo). To make Pam fall in love with Greg was easy. Before Greg could propose, he figures he needs to get the parents' approval. So he goes to Pam's parents' house in long island. I know it's Long island because a certain scene was filmed in Manhasset.Greg tries to impress Pam's father (Robert DeNiro)and mother (Blythe Danner),but each step he tries to make,is one bad step he messes up. Then, Greg finds out he can't be with his future wife. He must sleep in the basement. He finds out Pam's father, jack Byrnes, is with the CIA, resulting in a very great game of.. Lie Detector. That's basically the plot, I don't want to spoil it for you.DeNiro gives a great as protective father with a cat,Ben Stiller in his best role ever, so far. Blythe Danner is marvelous, reminding me of Sissy Spacek from ""Blast From The past"".DeNiro and Stiller have the funniest roles, and always give a good hearty laugh. I have never heard an audience laugh this hard. I watched the movie 5 times and I can't get enough of it! The audience roared with laughter at Stiller's funny antics, and DeNiro's comeback to shine.This movie is pure genius. Even better than Happy Gilmore. I can't help but laugh. My sides burst out as well! I recommend it to anyone. So if you haven't seen it on the big screen, see it NOW. Better than Scary movie. Scary Movie is nothing compared to Stiller and DeNiro.

'Analyze This' was rubbish, and he has such good presence in serious films. I don't know why he bothers with these stupid films.  Watch something wonderful, like 'Taxi Driver' instead.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
DeNiro's character is an annoying Focker-to-be,"Tremendously, Tremendously, Tremendously, Annoying. I can't abide people like him and anyone who puts up with him for more than an hour is a fool. His wife is a fool. His daughter is a fool. Stiller is a triple fool, because Stiller is not even related to him and he SUPPOSEDLY puts up with him for days. Nonsense.Aside from DeNiro, it isn't a bad film. It definitely has some funny moments, when DeNiro is not involved. Stiller is good. The mom is pretty good, but mostly inconsequential. The other problem the movie has is that the relationship between Stiller and his bride-to-be is blah, which makes it even harder to understand why Stiller SUPPOSEDLY puts up with the obnoxious DeNiro.",,Anonymous,Romance
The simple every-dayembarrassments of life,"The ideal cast for the part of Gaylord Focker was Ben Stiller. We can imagine a girl wanting to marry him but we can't imagine a father wanting him to be his son-in-law. I think Ben Stiller just had to play himself. The characters in this movie are not exaggerated. They exist, believe me. And that's what I find so great about it: it discovers the simple every-day embarrassments of life. Life is not like in the movies: things do not simply work!I didn't laugh very often during the movie, but I grinned without interruption from MARRY ME MAP` right until the end. For me, Meet the Parents` is one of the most perfect romantic comedies since let's say Four Weddings and a Funeral`.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Future in-laws, beware of the cat !","Once upon a time there was a fun couple living in Chicago, so much in love how could they have a problem in the world ? The answer is, take a trip to New York and visit your future in-laws whom you have never met. The antics and revelations that unfold in this wonderful comedy will make you laugh hysterically, and feel compassion during each and every scene. Ben Stiller portrays Greg Focker the lovable all to easy target of Jack Byrnes a former CIA agent played by Robert DeNiro. The cast of characters are more fun than you can ever imagine. Teri Polo as Pam Byrnes turns in a very nice performance as Stiller's love interest who tries to protect him from the interrogations he receives throughout the movie. This is a fun well made feel good movie that I would recommend highly.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Yeah it is a comedy but it's hard to root for a wimp.,"As several other reviewers stated this film while it has its funny moments it is not a comedy classic but still it is not bad at all.  Any normal male would have been `outa there' after the first few encounters with the parents and certainly after the pool volleyball game. That is perhaps the most interesting element of the film is that the Ben Stiller character continues to put up with all of it and makes the viewer want to shout out ""TELL EM OFF YOU WIMP"". However any guy with any self-respect would inform their girl friend that if they do in fact end up getting married it is with the understanding that he is going to have nothing to do with her family.   The Greg character putting up with so much made him hard to root for or feel sorry for and it was impossible to side with her parents' side/clan.  Again it's comedy so should be viewed that way however even in a comedy nobody can side with a total wimp.  A great scene for the viewer would have been to have had the Stiller character go off on the parents' etc the way Stiller goes off on the airline rep.",,Anonymous,Romance
READ THIS!!!,"I'll keep this review short and sweet.These days, the only funny scenes in most comedy films are all shown in the film's trailer. And I would be lying if I said that I didn't go to this movie under protest. I mean I saw the previews, I snickered a little, and I didn't think any more about it.You've got your innocent and charming ""funny guy"" (Stiller) who meets ""Yo taukin' to me?"" (DeNiro).

This movie was, hands down, one of the funniest movies I've seen all year long. It was what ""Analyze This"" should have been.I'll tell you right now, don't go into this movie expecting a really in-depth well thought out plot. It's a comedy - its purpose is to make you laugh. Instead, go into this movie expecting to laugh and you will.So if you haven't had a really good laugh in a long time, I'm talking about the kind of laugh that makes your sides hurt and make you wish you didn't drink that large coke, you need to go out and see, or rent, this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Thanks. Now I cannot listen to ""Puff, the Magic Dragon"" normally as before","The film is about a minefield of awkward situations that Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) has to navigate through when he first met his one's potential in-laws.The film's success largely rests on the shoulders of its talented cast. Ben Stiller brings his signature brand of humor to the role of Greg, making him a sympathetic and lovable character who elicits both laughs and empathy.Robert De Niro's portrayal of the intimidating and overly protective Jack Byrnes is a masterclass in deadpan comedy, and his interactions with Greg form the core of the film's comedic conflict.""Meet the Parents"" excels in delivering situational comedy that stems from Greg's increasingly precarious attempts to make a good impression on Mr. And Mrs. Byrnes. The film is filled with cringe-worthy and awkward moments that strike a chord with anyone who has faced a nerve-wracking encounter with their partner's parents.Beyond the comedic elements, ""Meet the Parents"" explores themes of family dynamics, trust, and the lengths people are willing to go to in order to gain acceptance from their loved ones.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Hysterical,"Seeing this film was a a pleasant surprise. I don't remember laughing so hard since *There's Something About Mary*. Not that I'm usually fond of outrageous comedies, but sometimes I am.The only cast member I knew when I got in the cinema was DeNiro. I didn't know about Teri Polo or Ben Stiller, and sure this was a good way to get to know them. I think she is very cute and not yet the spaghetti-like figure Hollywood seems to be obsessed with. I enjoyed Robert DeNiro's comic side, something he hasn't showed too often, unfortunately, being Midnight Run the only exception as far as I know.Some detractors of Meet The Parents have come down really hard on it, saying the comic situations are too exaggerated, but that's what makes the movie so hilarious ok?

Movies that don't count on toilet humor, or a group of unfunny, try to be hip people, talking about unfunny, try to be hip, topics that just aren't funny or hip to get a laugh. They should relies on smart, funny writing, and a great cast that seems to enjoy the material they are given.  The plot is simple, Ben Stiller's character is trying to impress his girlfriend's father enough to give him permission to marry her. Robert De Niro plays the father from hell who grills Stiller every chance he gets.  Every lie, ever statement, every action is under De Niro's scrutiny, and believe me, Stiller does more than enough to alienate himself from the father.  It starts out badly and gets worst as the movie progresses.     This is Stiller's best work since Something about Mary.  He plays basically the same type of persona, but lets face it, it's a funny persona.  The nice guy who is just caught up in events that start out innocently , but quickly spiral out of his control, and every attempt to right things just brings up more problems.  I also think this is De Niro's best comic performance since Analyze This.  A simple sneer at the rambling prayer Stiller gives at the diner table brought a huge laugh from the audience I saw the movie with.

Ben Stiller is given pointless and stupid stuff throughout the movie and really makes no connection with Teri Polo, Owen Wilson would go much better with her. The usual drug references and literal potty humor are uninspired, it's as if the writers gathered around some inane sitcom scripts and padded them with this stuff that wouldn't be allowed on TV. A really weak effort, but at least it's better than the sequel, which manages to misuse Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand.

I loved and admired such dark comedies as ""After Hours,"" ""The Out of Towners"" and even ""Something About Mary,"" but they had something that this one lacked: intelligence and a sense of the unexpected.  This script seemed to be written around Stiller & DeNiro, a series of gags and sketches that add up to a big rollicking nothing.  This is very much in the ""Home Alone"" vein, written for adolescents who revel in unsubtle physical humor, much of it based in cruelty (S&M all the way) with a sickly sweet ending that was a foregone conclusion from the beginning.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

His stay at their house is, lets say, unconventional, as however hard Greg tries to impress it always backfires making him look worse and worse after each sorry event.

Right Movie for the Wrong Reason.,"This was set out to be a hysterical, even the Grossout film. However I didn't get that impression when I saw this. I think it is a excellent romance movie, and a ok comedy.Despite the physical humor and impossibly bad circumstances surrounding Greg (aka Gay Lord) Focker (BEN STILLER) his trip is not completely out of this world. Almost everyone has a nightmare story when meeting your boy/girl-friends' parents. I for one can relate the story depicted in this movie. Although not as bad, but certainly memorable.Even if it's rated Comedy, the film does present a drama of relationships, how the Daughter Loves Greg; how the farther-in-law from Hell (ROBERT DeNIRO) leans to accept Greg for what he is. It proves Love is inseparable. Even it's a CIA agent in between.it's laughs were all funny and good. But it does not bring it self above the bunch with that. (in fact Jim Carrey does it much better) What really sets MEET THE PARENTS apart is the fact that, beneath the laughingstock surface, there is a serious human story of love to be told.I give it an 8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Best Comedy in 2000,"This is simply the best movie comedy I have seen this year.  If it had a point to it, some deeper meaning, it would be in my running for best movie of the year.Put simply, this movie is one giant situation comedy without much anything more to say.  The gags are logical, but in no way truly predictable (i.e. you know *exactly* what's going to happen, to the very detail).  Granted, if you're really looking that far in advance for it, you're going to find it -- though you're not really enjoying the movie.  Overall, no cheap laughs, everyone is hard earned and set up nicely and logically.MTP generates a lot of laughs without being crude (unless you consider the play on last names).  It truly blew my expectations away.  The preview does not do this movie justice.  Even when I recognized some of the bits from the preview, they were funnier in the movie (except maybe the polygraph test, which is about the same).  There was no sap, no cheesey moments, save for the end, which tidies things up nicely.  Normally, I have no place in movie for those types of scenes, but this movie makes no attempts to say anything more anyway, so it is excusable.Watch this movie.  It destroys Scary Movie (vulgar and crude, ""so stupid it has to be funny"") in terms of sheer hilarity.  I also rate MTP above There's Something About Mary, and American Pie because, again, it does not have to lower its standards to get cheap laughs.  Also, the pace is much better than these other movies.  The timing is excellent, with plenty of logical humor as well as physical hilarity.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Best comedy in years,"I like comedies as much as the next guy, but I think that comedy as a genre tends to produce mediocre films more often than any other genre, and even the best of comedies aren't as likely as other genres to produce a film worth more than one viewing.  It could be worse for comedy, though, as I think horror and action produce more outright bad movies than other genres.Anyway, I think the mediocre tendency in comedy has been even more prevalent then normal in the past few years, as most of the major comedies releases have been, well, average efforts in my opinion, and I'm speaking of films such as: There's Something About Mary, both the Austin Powers movies, and Analyze This.  You might notice I haven't included any of the ""teen"" comedies, but that's because I consider ""teen"" to be a genre onto itself. And, now that I think about it, ""teen"" is even worse than horror and action because it produces almost nothing other than terrible films, particularly if teen and horror combine without the word ""scream"" in the title.  Comedy's looking better all the time.But, alas, I digress.  The point of the matter is that, with Meet the Parents, I've finally found a comedy that beats this mediocre trend.  And, if you're anal about movie knowledge like I am, you're probably noticed that Meet the Parents includes, in its stars and director, people involved in each of the average films I mention above.  In fact, that bit of trivia had made me somewhat wary of seeing this film.Luckily for me, I crumbled.  Meet the Parents is not only funnier that any other strict comedy in years, but it is also smarter.  Part of my problem with a lot of comedies these days is the overuse of sight gags and toilet humor.  Not that I have a problem with either, but I feel like movies insult my intelligence when they use either too often.  Meet the Parents has its share of both, but most of the really funny stuff is verbal or situational. There's even an instance or two of choice satire near the film's end.What surprised my the most about Meet the Parents, however, is how many of the laughs come from De Niro.  He's definitely the straight man, but he's got some good lines.  He's also well cast, and he has essentially taken a lot of his more prominent roles and toned them down into an overprotective father.  At the same time, he's likeable, and that impresses me.  His is the best performance in the movie and also his best in years.True, Meet the Parents is a little over-the-top, but so what?  It's also highly entertaining, and the fact that I would willfully watch it again, knowing the jokes, says a lot for it in my book.  9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Hilarious,"Comedies seem to be Robert De Niro's new line of work.  He seems to do comedies very well.

First meetings can leave lasting impressions...,"Just ask Debbie what happened to her eye.Ben Stiller has turned out a wonderful performance.

It was refreshing to see a simple story line develop into such a humorous snowball effect. And let's not forget Mr. Jinx.The supporting cast is excellent! Robert Deniro can play ANYONE and pull it off. Blythe Danner does a great job playing the doting mother and wife. Debbie, Denny, Dr. Bob and his parents, and...oh, yes...Kevin (Owen Wilson)was a scream.If you can hear them above the laughter, pay very special attention to the innuendo and the just-off-camera comments (i.e. Pam's new name and every other word being the new ""F"" word.)

I hate movies that think it's funny to destroy the nice guy.,"Meet the Parents falls into a genre of comedy that I've heard others describe as cringe comedy. In fact, this might be the poster-child for that little subgenre. It focuses entirely on a likeable guy who is always trying to do the right thing, and everything goes wrong for him. I am entirely incapable of laughing at that, in fact I find myself constantly annoyed and tense. I can't help sympathizing with Ben Stiller, and get unbelievably upset as if these things are happening to me. While this kind of thing might make some people laugh, for me it's like emotional torture porn. I knew it wasn't going to go well when the song over the Universal logo starts with the line ""Show me a man who is gentle and kind, and I'll show you a loser."" It's like they started with the thesis statement for Robert De Niro's character, and the film itself doesn't shy away from the fact that he might be right. I've never seen a bigger sad sack than Greg Focker.To add insult to the emotional injury of Meet the Parents, many of the events and characters in the film come across as exaggerated and ridiculous. I suppose some people find that allows them to laugh more because it's not like this is something that would really happen, but I was just more irritated by it. I also despise the fact that there are so many problems in this film that are exacerbated by people lying or just failing to have a simple conversation. I understand the screenwriters' logic for why these conversations don't happen, but this kind of basic lack of communication is a big pet peeve of mine. I also find that Teri Polo's character behaves despicably and seems to lack any empathy, as she is constantly not aware of how awful things are for her boyfriend. From beginning to end, Meet the Parents is torturous for me to watch, and I'll be happy to never watch anything like it again.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

A must miss!,"Barf. Similar to ""What about Bob"", you have a likeable good guy who hits a spell of bad luck and ends up with everybody hating him. Considering it was a comedy, there were some rather long parts of the film during which no laughter was heard throughout the audience. In particular, the last five minutes, and the stop-and-go car race home. Yawn.There were several pee-pee and poo-poo jokes which left the toddlers in the audience giggling all the way home. Overall, however, not very many memorable lines, nor a very original premise. I give it a 4/10.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

Ben has always been one of my favorite comedians since he has his own show on Fox show a few years ago that no one watched because it disappeared after half a season. Anyway he is great as usual and a little more subtle than in Something About Mary. Good to see Blythe Danner( Gweneths Mother ) again.

The best comedy of the year 2000,"Meet The Parents is a revelation. A great script, superb cast and very solid direction from Jay Roach (director of Austin Powers 1 & 2) are all redeeming factors. Ben Stiller stars as Greg Focker (what a surname) who has plans to marry his beautiful girlfriend Pam, played by Teri Polo. However once he's met the parents (Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner) he begins to have second thoughts. Full of comedy moments and sharp one-liners, Meet The Parents is by far the best comedy of 2000, because it does not need gross-out moments to provide laughs, whereas flicks like Road Trip and Scary Movie do.

That said, this movie hit home harder than any comedy in years.My biggest concern going into the film was that all of the funny scenes were 'spoiled' by the preview.  This was certainly not the case.  ""Meet the Parents"" had my girlfriend and I guffawing unabashedly.  The rest of the audience seemed a bit slow to pick up on the sense of humor of the film, but soon caught on.

It is obvious that he let his actors improv and it was a wise decision. The chemistry is remarkable.I truly think this is a wonderful film and I definitely will be seeing it again.

Disappointing comedy.....,"I guess I'm in the minority when I say that I found ""Meet the Parents"" to be very disappointing. In spite of all the hype and advertising, I just didn't think the film was funny. I mean when the running joke of the movie is the hero's surname (Focker) you know the producers are going to be hard up for laughs. And yes, we are again exposed to yet another ""typical American family"" living in an upscale neighborhood with riches and privileges only few outside the movie colony can afford.Ben Stiller as the hero does the best that he can with limited material. Robert DeNiro as the prospective father-in-law is again parodying his tough guy image, but it doesn't come off this time as well as it did in ""Analyze This"" (1999). DeNiro's performance, I thought, was a bit over the top, and was for the first time a performance of his that I didn't thoroughly enjoy. The performance of Teri Polo as Stiller's love interest didn't impress me. Blythe Danner is wasted as DeNiro's scatterbrained wife. Owen Wilson's character is a bit of a mystery. How are we to believe that a hugely successful businessman such as he seems to be, can't even get a date for dinner ""at the Club"". My god, even ex-beauty queen Phyllis George is in the cast, but if you blink you'll miss her.I was not impressed with the be-belittling of the nursing profession or the continuous insults heaped upon the Stiller character. If fact, I was rooting for him to turn around and walk out right from the beginning. Both Stiller and DeNiro have done and will do better. Extremely disappointing.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

It's great to see such diversity in what he can play. He didn't even need to say anything, just holding up a cat called Mr. Jinx and puckering at it is enough to make any grown man cry from laughter. Stiller is at his best here as well, combining his Jewishness with a clutzy attitude makes for a hysterical combination. I'm glad he stayed away from all those Jewish family/mother jokes because they seem to be getting old. Great showing from the girl who played Stiller's fiance (can't remember her name right now). She's the one who added a touch of drama and romance to finish up the package. All in all, a great movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Hard to warm up to it.....,"Frankly, I did not find the film to be very funny or entertaining. It seems that the measure of a film now-a-days is not how much it entertains, but how well it does at the box office. Some pretty lousy films have done well with ticket sales, while some other films have had something to say, but have fallen short of the dollar mark. This was an OK film, but not one that I would call a ""must see"" movie. And then, for it to spawn a sequel is beyond all belief. I tried to give the movie a fair watching--after all, I assumed that with De Niro on the screen there would be much there to watch--but I kept finding myself mouthing off the words of the kids in the back seat of the van ..."" are we there yet??"" De Niro has a broad spectrum, a big range for his acting talents. But he is an extraordinary actor who, it seems, falls flat on his face when he is not cast as an extraordinary character. It was awfully big of him to take the role of the father, but it felt more like casting Humphrey Bogart as an extra. And as for Ben Stiller...he still has a ways to go to establish a screen persona. His character was somewhat nebulous...though he did well at defining how vulnerable the character was. Comparing Stiller to De Niro, or even to his father, Jerry, is something of an unfair comparison, but he has yet to come up with that defining character or characteristic. The situations are stretched somewhat out of proportion, and Jay Roach's direction works far better with Mike Myers, where reckless abandon of plot and characters are the rule and not the exception. Based on what I saw in this film, I am in no hurry to see ""The Fockers"". I only recommend this film if you have nothing better to do.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great Comedy,"It had been a long time since I have seen a comedy; however, Meet the Parents was well-worth the wait.

Terri Polo, Blythe Danner, and James Rebhorn are solid in supporting roles, but it is Owen Wilson that really shines.  Keep an eye on him--because he will be a star.

"Meet the parents aims to high and fires too low, the most overrated movie in recent years.","Magazine reviews, word of mouth and trailers had me expecting to see the next all American comedy hit since 'There's something about Mary'.  What i experienced when i sat down to watch this film was a film that aims to achieve such accalaids as its '...Mary' but instead offers a flat, dull comedy that does offer some very funny set pieces, (most of which had been used in the trailer).Stiller is consistant as the likable romantic lead who cannot please his future father in-law, played by DeNiro, who although is fully competent in a comedic role, is let down by a very dull character.The principle for the film is very good and the set piece ideas are all potential comedy classics, but the script (which excells in new levels of dullness) and the direction, hinder these scenes form fulfilling there potential.If any of you have ever seen 'The Bachelor party' with Tom Hanks, the 10 minute scene where he goes to his future in-laws house, you will see the potential this plot had.  The characters are all superior to Meet the Parents, which at the end of the day is the reason why Meet the Parents is a big let down.Don't get me wrong, its no disaster, I've seen worse movies, but for a film that promised so much and aimed so high, it misses the target by far too big a margin for it to ever sustain its place in 'comedy-classic' territory.... 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

I admit that it had it's predictable moments, but over all, I think the jokes worked very well and the cast was just so wonderful to watch. Robert and Ben click very well, they were so great in making the scenes just so intense, like that first dinner they have together, Ben describing how he grew up on the farm and had to milk a cat in order to save a runt kitten, was just so funny because we've all been there where we got caught up in a lie trying to figure a way out of it. The story is very funny and something everyone has to go through in their time of meeting the parents.Greg is a nurse who is about to purpose to his girlfriend, Pam, but when she tells him first of how her sister got proposed to and how her fiancée asked her father first, Greg feels obligated to ask him first before asking Pam. They go to meet her parents, Jack and Dina. Jack is a former CIA agent who is not ready to let his baby go to Greg. He's gonna make sure that this is a trip that Greg will never forget and is gonna torment him the whole way.The only problem I have is that it seems like all the good parts that my friends told me about, well, that was it. So it wasn't as surprising, but I still admit that I laughed. I loved that scene where they're playing volleyball with Pam's ex and how the team just won't give Greg a break how how he's playing and then he... well, you'll have to trust me, it gets better.

Just a good old-fashioned comedy,"Once upon a time, comedy writers sought to create humor through plot and character development, rather than merely packing the script with crude sight gags and one-liners.  ""Meet the Parents"" is a long-overdue renaissance of this lost art form.  While most modern comedy films are all punch lines and no joke, this one earns its laughs the old-fashioned way--building comedic situations and using its one-liners as mere icing on the cake.  As a result, ""Meet the Parents"" bears more resemblance to ""Some Like it Hot"" than it does to ""There's Something About Mary"".Having recently been married myself, (inheriting a stern set of in-laws) I found myself identifying strongly with the ill-fated Ben Stiller character. The increasingly complicated situations in which he becomes ensnared were physically stressful to watch.  The father (Robert DeNiro) is demanding and intrusive.  The girlfriend (Teri Polo) is too self-absorbed to notice how badly things are going.  The hapless suitor makes increasingly boneheaded decisions in a desperate effort to curry favor.  We've all been there.  We see ourselves in the characters, and we're forced to laugh at the sheer absurdity of it all.The acting is solid, the script is as tightly wound as a good episode of ""Seinfeld"", and the laughs are abundant.  You can't ask much more than that from a comedy.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Meet the Parents"", I'd like you to meet the rubbish bin","I went into ""Meet the Parents"" with an open mind, in the mood to see a lighthearted but somewhat intelligent comedy.  Considering the two stars (DeNiro & Stiller), I thought I had a good shot at getting what I was looking for.  Unfortunately I was sorely disappointed; ""Meet the Parents"" is nothing more than a 2-hour cliche, with a horrible script full of more holes than Swiss cheese.For example, Stiller's character name was Gaylord Focker.  So everyone in the film keeps addressing him ""Hey Focker!""  That's not funny, that's sophomoric!  Once would have been okay, but from beginning to end?  Focker is a male nurse, which makes him an endless target for being less than a whole man.  Isn't that fodder for an after-school special from the 1970s?But the thing that destroys this film is the horrible plot.  I guess we're supposed to recognize that DeNiro's character (the father of Focker's girlfriend) is kind of a psycho, but at the same time, Focker is exactly what the overprotective Dad claims: a habitual liar.  Then, after Focker has wreaked all kinds of havoc on his future hopeful in-laws DeNiro does an about face and realizes that Focker is the right guy for his daughter, as long as he loves her.  What the hell??  You just spent two hours developing a character and then in two minutes you tear it down...  I know that it's written in the U. S. Constitution that all films must have happy endings, but you could have found a more plausible way to arrive at that legally binding conclusion.  The movie makes absolutely no sense.  So Focker didn't lie about his MCAT scores, he lied about everything else.  But the MCAT score is the thing that saves him?  Why is an MCAT score from 10 years ago more important than the dozens of disasters he has caused?I know it's just a comedy, but where is it written that comedies don't need to be written and filmed in a logical and intelligent way?   If you want to see a GOOD dark comedy about a bad luck streak, check out ""After Hours"" or ""The Out of Towners"" (the 1970 original).

Three's Company meets Insensitive Parents(tm),"I dunno, apparently I'm the only one out here who didn't like this movie. I left the movie feeling cheated and upset. It felt like a bad episode of Three's Company, with a big budget.The humor was weak and thin, most of the funny moments were shown in the previews, and the especially sad part was, over and over there were WONDERFULLY funny situations and setups, that would just fall flat. Most of the humor was the kind of disparaging ""how embarrassed can we make the poor little Jewish boy"" junk that Three's Company and it's ilk made famous.Apparently the rest of the world loves this movie, but I was embarrassed walking out of the theatre, and wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy (well, maybe him, since he has no taste anyway).",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Unoriginal waste of talent,"Gaylord Focker. There, now you've seen (or read) just about the only original joke in the whole movie.

Marsha's going to the Prom so Greg, Peter, or Bobby breaks her nose with a football, cleverly changed to a wedding and volleyball in this, Greg's fiancée's old boyfriend, Owen Wilson, in a thankless role, (Actually all of the roles are thankless or maybe worthless) builds a beautiful hand made wood gazebo, gee, you don't think Greg's stupid careless smoking will burn it to the ground, do you? Flushing the basement commode will flood the yard with sewage and ruin the wedding. Gosh, that'll never happen!

Jay Roach has taken his Austin Powers cartoonism too far.,"This is one of those films that was advertised so heavily, I felt like I'd seen it before I actually saw it. They used all the best gags in the ads (which isn't saying much) and the presence of De Niro dominated. Maybe it's just me, for I know this was a big hit, but I couldn't stand seeing a highly regarded actor like Robert De Niro mugging his way through this lowbrow flick like it were a 108-minute Saturday Night Live sketch--which is what it should have been. It is staggeringly annoying watching Ben Stiller endure thinly veiled threat after threat, and it's not even rewarding when he finally stands up for himself.Judging by this films box-office take, I guess I'm not in the majority when I say I am sick of the whole ""you're not good enough for my daughter"" schtick in movies and TV (the dreck known as ""8 Simple Rules"" is another example). However, I would like to thank IMDb for this website which allows me to vent my extreme displeasure at this totally unoriginal and irritating trend. I found this ""comedy"" utterly awful.P.S. If you agree with me, you might want to check out the Roach's previous film, Mystery Alaska. I wish it had been a hit, and Roach were making more subtle comedies like it today rather than succumbing to using easy gags and pandering to mainstream taste.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Good idea, shame about the movie","On the inside of Meet the Parents is a great plot idea, struggling to get out. Actually, that's not strictly true - the plot is actually realized pretty well; it's the supposed timing and unrelenting nature of the events that, for me, make this film no better than mediocre.The premise is simple: About to propose to Pam (Teri Polo), his girlfriend, Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) realises he's expected to ask her father's permission first. Of course, Jack (Robert de Niro) turns out to be every suitor's worst nightmare: demanding, condescending, belittling. Worse, it seems Greg can do nothing right.The bulk of the film documents everything that happens over a weekend at the parental home. Pam's sister is getting married, so it's a big get-together with family and friends. The battering starts immediately; Greg's luggage goes missing. Jack makes snide comments over the colour of his rental car and choice in pets. Greg even causes chaos when opening a bottle of wine.He is mocked for his choice of career - he's a nurse. Guess what: half the guests are doctors. He's intimidated by Pam's previous boyfriend, the seemingly perfect Kevin (Owen Wilson). His surname makes him an easy target. He manages to lose the family's pet cat, so he buys a replacement which looks nearly identical - which promptly tears the wedding dress to shreds. His luggage turns up, and Jack searches it, finding a pile of women's clothes - because, of course, it's not his bag.It transpires that Jack is a former CIA agent - except Greg becomes convinced he's still involved in some covert operation. So he blurts out what he knows - and, wouldn't you just know it, he's put his foot in it again.Taken individually, each incident is at least passably funny; some are hilarious; some make you cringe on Greg's behalf. But it's the whole thing - the relentless progression from one minor disaster to the next - where I felt the movie fell down. At first, it's pretty funny, watching this guy make a complete fool of himself; but when it goes on and on, and you realize you're in for an hour where nothing, NOTHING goes right, it just gets depressingly tedious.And it's not all perfect. The surname gag grew old fairly quickly; the way people addressed him using only his surname was downright rude rather than funny; one leaking toilet would NOT flood a yard, no matter how full the septic tank (and what kind of planning is it to hold a big wedding party with the tank ready to blow?) The happy ending was also pretty unconvincing.I haven't really said anything about the performances. I felt everyone did a reasonable job, nobody excelled. de Niro *can* do comedy - Brazil, Midnight Run - but here, I thought he was too deadpan, and the role just a bit *too* psycho. Stiller was a good choice for the lead, and Owen Wilson is great as the all-too-perfect ex. But, as I said, it's the pacing that spoils things. If they had spread the pain out a little - shown meetings over several weekends - along with scaling it back a little, I'd have enjoyed it a lot more.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not something most can relate to,"I found this movie in a VCR player and decided to watch it because I am a huge Owen Wilson Fan (as my name clearly implies).I was a little disappointed by the main premise of the movie--I was expecting something a little more realistic (the VHS tape, after all, had originally been from Blockbuster video...or possibly Hollywood, I don't remember because I loaned it to someone I met on the internet so cannot check now to see but I'm pretty sure it was Blockbuster. It could have been from Hollywood though. Like I said, I don't remember so please don't IM me about this information).For starters, why would anyone need to meet someone else's parents when they have parent's of their own (that they do not need to meet, unless they were abandoned as children and left either at an orphanage or for dead on the harsh, realistic streets of New York City. Even then, I really don't see the point of meeting the parent's who never loved you). What made this idea even more improbable, was the idea that there was a great deal of distance to travel for that meeting to occur...I'm not sure what Owen Wilson was thinking when he accepted this part. What I do know is that I have never met anyone else's parents other than my own (my parents loved me very much and did not abandon me in New York City). And I'm glad too, because from what this movie portrays, other people's parent's are very mean and would probably judge me off of my character.If you're looking for a realistic film about social situations I would much rather you watched Saving Private Ryan. It's a lot like this movie but a lot more realistic.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
"awful, honestly","Okay so why is this movie so bad? the movie revolves around Ben Stiller and all the supposedly ""funny"" things that happen to him. In the end it's just Ben Stiller doing everything wrong. thats just not funny nor entertaining. On the other hand there are some scenes, that are just great. Like when he wants to check in at the airport and when he is on the plane. A must see.It boils down to rather uninspired comedy, with Robert de Niro acting waaaayy below his standards and Ben Stiller being really dumb all the time not worth seeing it 1/5",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
annoying,"I dislike movies where the main character gets into trouble by lying. Especially stupid, pointless lies that will obviously be found out eventually.  There have been some bad offenders, but this movie takes it to ridiculous extremes.  Ben Stiller's character is weak, stupid, dishonest, unsympathetic, and way beyond the threshold of believability. And even if those things don't bother you, the movie just isn't funny.The people responsible for this dud should take some lessons from ""There's Something About Mary"".  That had much riskier humour, which could have blown up in their face, but worked.  One of the reasons was because under the gruff exterior, it had a good heart.  It had *charm*.  Under this contrived mess of insecurity and deception was nothing but a lump of coal.  I felt the stupid Focker deserved every bad thing that happened, and more.  The sappy Hollywood ending rang hollow as a result.  Pheh.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Good Comedy by Jay Roach,"This film is about Greg, or Gaylord, Focker who decides to spend a week to meet his Pam's (girlfriend) father because Pam thinks it would be nice for Greg to see if her father accepts him before they get engage. He soon finds out that her father is very strict and that he is very protective of his daughter and wants what is the best for her.This film is sweet and funny. Some of the jokes could be laugh out loud and some could be overrated. Greg does many things to hide all of the bad things he's done like make Jinxy, the family's cat, to run away and lit the alter, for Pam's sister's wedding, on fire. Many films have targeted this plot but it's so amazing how I like films with the same basic plot.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Stupid characters, inexplicable actions, a few laughs","I'm one of those people who have to see a sort of logic in a movie character's behavior to fully enjoy any resulting comedy. If a character takes a wrong turn somewhere and tries to get back on course but in the process takes an even more wrong turn and fun ensues, that's fine. But if a character gets lost and instead of trying to turn back decides to set his pants on fire or run over someone sitting on a park bench for no apparent reason, that is not funny to me. That's why I rated Meet the Parents a 5.The main character, played by Ben Stiller, lies for no reason and then gets caught in his lies and makes them worse. He takes actions that he isn't supposed to and has been warned not to do then lies when he is asked if he did so and blames something (a cat) else. And when Greg tries to find the missing cat, he quickly stoops low enough to paint a different cat's tail and try to pass it off as the missing feline (why no one notices the paint smell until later that night, and then they do, is a mystery).  The guy isn't especially likeable and you keep wanting to slap him and say, ""Just tell the truth! It works!""Meanwhile, his girlfriend expects Ben (called ""Greg"" in the movie) to instantaneously act like he is a member of a family he has never met. When Greg needs clothes, his girlfriend tells him to wake up her brother -- whom Greg has never met and whose bedroom door is closed while the brother is apparently asleep -- and borrow some of his. Uh, not a good idea. Later, his girlfriend drops little bomblets on Greg, such as the fact that the best man at a family wedding is her ex-finacee (by the way, Greg never even knew that his girlfriend had been engaged), or that the dad had a different career than what she had told Greg earlier.All in all this group of characters spends a lot of time cleaning up messes that would have been easily avoided if a little truthful communication had taken place beforehand. It is that fact that kept me from enjoying any of the contrived situations that ensued. In fact, to me the funniest part of this movie was an airline gate agent who acts like, well, an airline gate agent, regardless of the actual situation around her. *That* was not contrived at all and was laugh out loud funny.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Am I missing something?,"I have been waiting for a long time for a comedy that would get me laughing, I mean really laughing, and after waiting 4 weeks and reading all the reviews it seemed like Meet the Parents would be a winner.Unfortunately I was mislead.  I haven't felt this cheated out of my $11 admission since the Blair Witch Project.I figured that since I hadn't seen the trailers for the movie, that at least I wouldn't have seen all the funny scenes in advance.  However, since all the comic scenes were so heavily foreshadowed, you knew what was going to happen before you got there anyway, and the effect was ruined.  I'll admit to a few chuckles, but nothing that even resembled a true laugh.The humour was dry, the characters awkward and by the time you got to the end, I really didn't care what happened to any of them.I really wasn't a fan of ""Something about Mary"" either, but it was a piece of comedic genius compared to this one.

I side with the parents,"When I went to the theaters with my family to see Meet the Parents, I was only a kid. Most of the humor just wasn't accessible to me, and I saw it through a child's lens. I didn't see anything wrong with a relationship being reevaluated because your boyfriend doesn't get along with your family. It seemed perfectly reasonable that the woman's parents would be as tough as possible on who might be their future son-in-law. If he's going to join the family, raise their grandchildren, and be responsible for their daughter's safety, security, and happiness for the rest of her life, he should fill more criteria than just making her heart beat faster. And finally, as a little girl, the most memorable part of the film was the ""gag"" about replacing the lost cat. No ten-year-old girl who sneaks her kitten back into the house after everyone's gone to bed could laugh at a situation like that.However, I realize this movie is a modern classic, and that everyone else in the country loves it. If I saw the movie again as a grown-up, I have a funny feeling I'd still side with Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner, rather than sweethearts Teri Polo and Ben Stiller.

Utterly disappointing,"I have heard nothing but positive things about Meet the Parents, and I watched it, boy was that an epic waste of time. I'm not one for ranting on a movie that I think is atrocious so I'll try to be brief. Let's start with the positive of this movie....... Yea that's about it. There isn't much. There is very little that satisfied me, but it's a matter if preference with this movie. Here's why.Everyone was essentially a miss on casting, in my opinion. They did their job, but other actors could have done it better. For example, this is a comedy movie that relies on awkward comedy. It is exactly that. 100% awkward. If that's the comedy you like, this is your movie. I'm not a big fan of awkward comedies like this, so they have to be really good comedies for me to enjoy them. The cast does their job, but it could have been done better by other people. I feel like I'm starting to rant, but I'll conclude here.

Meet the Parents,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerFirst off, the story does have some funny parts, like all the destruction, but it is mostly a romance than a comedy. The story is a little slow and most of jokes didn't make me laugh.The acting is good. Robert De Niro, Owen Wilson, Teri Polo, Nicole DeHuff, and Blythe Danner all perform well. Ben Stiller is the same character he plays in all of his other movies. He, in my eyes, doesn't perform well.The pacing is slow and the runtime is overlong.All in all, this film is a romance first and a comedy second.Pros: Some funny jokes, the disaster scenes, some good acting, and a good romance storyCons: Ben Stiller's performance, slow pacing, an overlong runtime, some unfunny jokes, and this film is a romance not a comedyOverall Rating: 5.0",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Teri Polo is why I watch these trilogy movies,"It's only because Greg Focker is a strange guy that Jack Byrnes is reluctant to acknowledge him as a future son-in-law.

Who gives a man a flower pot the first time they meet but the flower will take about six months to bloom? It's absurd, not funny. Why not just have a normal guy get all rattled about meeting his future father-in-law and even more so when he finds out the man was a spy?My rating was 9...for Teri Polo but I had to deduct stars for the silly attempt at humor. The sequels are funnier, mainly because Greg's weirdness doesn't really matter anymore.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bad First Instalment Film,I am not entirely sure what the crew were thinking or trying to do when they were creating this first instalment film.

Why i didn't like this film,"I generally like these type of ""silly"" comedies. But I didn't like this one.What makes this movie different from other movies of this genre, is that our main character Greg Focker isn't the typical stupid guy with a good heart that we see in comedies of this sort. Instead, Greg is a real jerk, who takes every chance he can to do something nasty. He displays himself as a coward and a liar -- a rather spine-less person. Incidentally, he is revealed to be Jewish, and perhaps one could say that he fits a stereotypical Jewish movie depiction: whining and full of self-pity.However, there were actually some surprisingly comical moments in the movie that made me laugh out loud. But the plot was just too stupid. Greg doesn't miss a single opportunity to blow something. In fact, he must have done damage for around 1,000,000 $. But will the father, Jack Byrnes, forgive him at the end? That was what I asked myself during the film: ""how will they stitch this all together"". I won't reveal the end, but I did find it uplifting compared to the previous hour.I feel a little sorry for Robert De Niro who had to act in such a silly film.

"Upon further review, not that funny","I like comedies so don't call me scrooge, but I've had a change of heart about Meet the Parents. I really feel a movie that can be seen over and over without getting sick of it is a sign of really great writing. I've seen comedies like Caddyshack, Fast Times, Beetlejuice, The Mask, Stripes (and others) so many times that I can pretty much recite the lines in verbatim. I still laugh after seeing them 100 times. But I recently changed the channel while watching Meet the Parents. I used to think it was original, funny, and a movie I could watch over and over, but it's not.The movie centers around Ben Stiller and he's not funny in this film. Watch him, listen to his lines, and the way he delivers them. That scene in the car about Puff the Magic Dragon was hard to watch him tripping over his tongue. Then the whole denying that he hates cats thing. Not funny. The funniest part of Ben Stiller is the end when he's talking to the camera, but the real funny aspect to that is that Robert DeNiro's watching.In fact, while some of DeNiro's humor is contrived, he's funny, Stiller's not. If it weren't for DeNiro, this would be complete trash.Overall I think there's some originality, the story is good, but there's too many actors that can't deliver a line, too much that's unrealistic, and too much unfunny.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
The King Of Comedy,"Beyond all the gangster, tough-guy villain roles that Robert De Niro is famous for, he has an interest in comedy and he's suprisingly good at it.

The jokes are well timed and even when it's slapstick there's still some wit to it.The most we can usually ask from a comedy is to give us a few jokes and not be unbearably stupid.

Hard to sympathize with Greg Focker,"Meet the Parents will make you laugh, however, there are many jokes that are either unfunny or cringeworthy. Much of the film's comedic value is due to Robert De Niro, who really steals the show. Most of the movie's cringe factor comes from the fact that Ben Stiller's character is hard to like. Many of the situations in the film are easily avoidable for anyone even remotely normal. For this reason, I do not find Meet the Parents to be as good as other Ben Stiller comedies such as Tropic Thunder, Zoolander, Night at the Museum, or Dodgeball.

This seems to be more of an obvious fear for the male in a heterosexual relationship than it is a woman's; the desire to make a presence that's simultaneously meaningful and respectful, but not too brazen, is a tricky dance to accomplish and the anxiety that accompanies such an event is usually too much to even begin to adequately articulate. One winds up overthinking everything to the point of either saying something they didn't mean to say or feeling like they have just made a complete fool of themselves in front of the person they love and her own family.I suppose I can rest easy knowing that writers Jim Herzfeld and John Hamburg have made a ""worst case scenario"" film about the subject, which effectively makes almost any evening spent with the parents of your significant other seem desirable and successful in comparison. Jay Roach's Meet the Parents is the kind of film that takes those fears and persistent worries and etches them into a film that ups the stakes so high that, after a while, it becomes difficult to laugh given how far the film has fallen from its own sense of realism. it takes a realistic and common fear and repeatedly throws so many incredulous situations towards it, turning it into a farce, that, by the end, it's not only hard to take the film seriously, but the characters as well.We meet Gregory Focker (Ben Stiller), a male nurse who has been in a relationship with Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo) and is working to execute the perfect marriage proposal as soon as he gets off work. Just before he's about to pop the big question, Pam gets a call from her sister that she is now engaged, right after her fiancée asked Pam's father for her hand in marriage. While Pam claims it isn't necessary to do such a thing, it's a sweet, traditionalist gesture. As a result, Greg keeps his plans under the wraps and agrees to go to Pam's family's home in Long Island for the wedding.Upon losing his luggage on the flight, Greg meets Pam's father Jack (Robert De Niro) and her mother Dina (Blythe Danner). Right off the bat, Jack is cold and offputting to Greg, emphasizing Greg's less-than-positive view of cats and his own career choice of being a nurse. This sets the tone for what will be the next few days - awkward, uncomfortable interactions that will revolve around Greg trying to please Jack, but, in the end, only resulting in frustration or anger on Jack's behalf. Things only get intensified when Greg winds up meeting Kevin (Owen Wilson), Pam's ex-fiancée who is helping organize her sister's wedding.Meet the Parents has a committed cast of greats, starting with De Niro and Stiller, the two obvious, and even making strong uses of Polo and Danner, who transcend supporting roles and have a few of their own moments to shine. Consider Polo's character consistently trying to tow the lines of loyalty to her father and express her love for Greg, while Danner's character's cheeriness is usually diminished by the sternness of her husband. The glaring effects of the male characters on the female characters is an interesting dichotomy, especially seeing as the female characters are the whole reason everyone is brought together.Other than that, and some surface relatability based on the basic premise of the film rather than the actual details, Meet the Parents is one long sitcom. The film houses a barrage of overblown sight gags, caricatures instead of characters, and a case of ""maximum antics, minimum laughter,"" where the writers continue to dogpile awkward scenarios on the characters while forgetting to humanize the characters in order for the gags to actually work. This is less a film and more an assortment of asinine events that work to beat the audience down with slapstick and a great deal of comedy that is almost too desperate to be funny.Meet the Parents will get empathy points from many, but the points it receives from its obvious brand of comedy should be relatively minimal. There's an appalling lack of human interest here outside of the film's concept, which is a big problem when you have a film that has the ability to resonate very deeply with people. Many of us have been in Greg's situation and many of us have found ourselves to be the worst enemy at times, but these elements, while substantial and ripe for exploration, can even be taken in a haphazard manner.Starring: Ben Stiller, Teri Polo, Robert De Niro, Blythe Danner, and Owen Wilson.

I read somewhere how this movie was a fluke,"I read somewhere how this movie was a fluke, perfect casting, great comedy, often imitated, but never equalled and so I thought that I really needed to see this piece of something... until I realised I had actually seen it but it did not strike me at the time as the comedy of the decade...",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fits-and-Starts,"The shock value Farrelly Brothers filmmaking that spawned ""There's Something About Mary"" is in abundance here, even going so far as to have Ben Stiller essentially reprise his role as a put-upon nebbish who can never seem to catch a break and winds up in the middle of disasters. ""There's Something About Mary"" was funny in spots but when it hit, it hit: the gags were so outrageous they compensated for the slow spots. ""Meet The Parents"" has the same fits-and-starts rhythm but the gags are merely pleasant and don't make up for the dead air that comprises most of the film. Stiller is an entertaining performer but he's beginning to typecast himself and is beginning to wear thin. Robert DeNiro, as the former CIA man whose daughter Stiller intends to wed, is enjoyable but he never manages to convey his intensity to the audience so they never feel completely, deliciously enthralled by him. Jay Roach directed, in a style typically subservient to Hollywood dictates. Not recommended.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Circle of Trust,"This is a hilarious comedy. The juxtaposing of old money with New York Jewish culture is a treat.  No matter how everyone tries to get along,the differences are just too great. The subtleties are wonderful, my favorite is the potted plant, a metaphor for the deeply buried potential of Pam and Gaylord's match.From Grandma's litter box to Greg's ""Motown cat milking days"", Meet the Parents is a pick me up for anyone who thinks he has had a bad day.",,Anonymous,Romance
I haven't laughed this hard since American Pie,"I didn't think that I would like this movie, but I was wrong. A boring summer at the theater gave this movie some freshness and great laughs.

A guaranteed laugh every 3-4 minutes.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Sorry, didn't like it!","So you know the plot.  The stupid decisions that Greg Focker makes during this film and coupled with the growing anti-""Greg"" sentiment building up from Robert De Niro's character made me antsy, angry and not buying it. Kelli Polo's character also makes some stupid mistakes that I didn't buy into.  Yes, it seems to be a bit of way out ""something About Mary"" kind of humor, but the puzzle pieces don't fit together.  Too much anti-Semitism for me.  Too much anti-male nurse teasing for me.  There is a point at which Ben Stiller's Greg becomes harassed and that's when it lost me.This stellar cast did the best job possible with a twisted, disjointed, unbelievable and doesn't know when to stop script!Yes I laughed out loud at much of the physical humor.  But I cringed at the ""Jewish"" jokes, the ""male nurse"" jokes and thought these things went too far.By the way, I'm not a Jewish male nurse...I wanted to like this movie!",,Anonymous,Romance

Quite Possibly the funniest movie ever made.,"Ok, so we have our hero, Greg Focker(Ben Stiller), who is taking his girlfriend Pam to her parents' home over the weekend.  Her father (Robert De Niro) and Mother (Blythe Danner), are a happily-married couple who are the most peculiar people in the world because they've actually ""lost"" their sense of humor.  Greg, walking in his girlfriend's parents' home, gets disaproval immediatly, which starts his brilliant and hilarious adventure to honesty. Ben Stiller couldn't be funnier and Robert De Niro(in his ""you talking to me"" role again), couldn't either.  Together, they make the worst enemies between father-in-law and son-in-law that I have ever seen.  It's 90 minutes of non-stop laughs, and makes my top-ten.  Thank you Meet the Parents. Meet the Parents has a brilliant script, so brilliant that is worth watching over 100 time. It is also worth watching with the family, I can't count how many times MY parents broke into laughs, probably reminded of their ""first encounter"" with their parents-in-law. All the characters are brilliant and hilarious, exactly like the movie. That's why I say it's the funniest movie ever.",,Anonymous,Romance
Straightjackets should be handed out to keep you dying from laughter !,"I recently saw this film and it was even funnier than I had imagined ! All my face muscles were worn out from laughing ! The way James Rebhorn pronounces the word "" Focker "" is just something else ! How does he do it ? The laughing muscles "" zigomatics "" are kept in constant use throughout this film and I would recommend it to anyone who's feeling down in the dumps. Robert de Niro gives a commanding performance as the ever so serious father-in-law. The only question I have is : the future fiancée must have known how things would turn out, especially as she lied to her betrothed about her own father's profession, and she seems rather ill at ease to deal with the embarrassing situations that occur ! One of the best comedies of recent years !",,Anonymous,Romance
funny,"This film is a very nice comedy. It made me laugh from beginning to end. I like comedies, because they make me happy and relaxed. However, in this film some parts are too absurd. Although they are funny (e.g. the name of the main character is `Greg Fokker'). Personally I don't think anyone's parents would give them a name like this. The actor Ben stiller suits the role perfectly. I enjoyed watching this film. I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to have a good laugh as this film is the funniest movie I have ever seen.",,Anonymous,Romance
Definitely a classic,"I just saw this movie today and I loved it.  When I saw the previews for it on TV, I thought it looked quite stupid.  That just proves that you can't make a proper judgment on a movie just by seeing its previews.   Male Nurse, Greg(or Gaylord)Focker is engaged to teacher Pamela Martha Byrnes.  I liked the scene at the beginning of the film where the children at Pam's school keep screwing up on the letters that they use trying to spell out: MARRY ME PAM (on one try, they spell out: MARRY ME MAP).  After Pam agrees, Greg has to ""meet the parents.""  The mother is just fine and likes Greg, but Jack(played by Danny DeVito)the father is a real jerk.  I didn't like him too much.  One part I found funny was where Greg was eating dinner with Pam and her parents.  He brought out a bottle of wine for them to drink.  He popped the cork, which hit  a vase that contained the ashes of Jack's mother.  The vase breaks and Jinks the Himalyan cat rushes over to the ashes and urinates in them.The acting in this film was wonderful.  So if you're a fan of comedy such as this, you should watch this movie.  It's definitely a classic.",,Anonymous,Romance
Bottomline: Hilarious!!!,"I just got out of Meet the Parents and simply put it is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  Maybe I'm biased because I love Bobby De Niro and Ben Stiller, but this combination on screen is the best I have seen in a while.  Why is this such a great movie????  Every piece of comedic action is right on the money, DeNiro who is a great actor once again takes a comedic role and has so much fun with it... Ben Stiller who is probably one of the most underappreciated comedic talents around is hilarious as well.  Every comedic segment is a great belly laugh.  As the dad, DeNiro has this psychotic presence surrounding him with traits from some of his best roles (Goodfellas, Cape Fear) and in this context it is funny.  If you liked him in Analyze This, you will really love him here because he is about 5 times better in this.  Overall the story is simple but very very humourous. We have all been in a situation where we had to meet our significant other's parents.  Here it turns into a nightmare and Ben Stiller as the common man boyfriend is you or me having probably the worst weekend of our lives.  It is impossible not to like Stiller and you immediately feel bad for the idiot as his weekend and relationship go awry.  Go run and see this it is so worth the admission.",,Anonymous,Romance

An Outrageous Movie...,Meet the Parents has a great cast; Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro. This makes it a watchable film already.  Stiller wants to propose to his girlfriend but decides to get the permission of her father first- a big mistake!  From then on it's on going laughs and it never stops! There are quite a few rather very outrageous bits but apart from that it's really good. In this film you cannot predict the funny parts so it just makes it even better!,,Anonymous,Romance
Such a great comedy,"This movie works on every level and it is so funny.  Beautifully timed with just the right mood, every performance is great.

Just great, rent or own it!",,Anonymous,Romance
everything went right here.,"So rarely does Hollywood turn out a decent comedy, that you've got to stand up and take notice of this movie.  It manages to be funny and entertaining at the same time. No small feat these days.  This movie works on two levels.  Yes, it's hilarious.  It really is. But it also works as a thriller.  I know that sounds silly, but this movie had me on the edge of my seat.  At certain points, I couldn't even look to see what horrible turn the plot might take.This film deserves all the success it's had.  And that's so rare.",,Anonymous,Romance
very good,"The first time I saw this movie, I was in a bad mood and didn't like it. That goes to show how significant moods can be when seeing a movie.  This really is a smart, funny movie.  Maybe it needs to be seen twice.  Anyway, I was certainly wrong the first time I saw it.  Focker's plight does get a little frustrating, but that is called dramatic tension--""Three's Company"" lived off the same kind of stuff for years.  It is done much better here.  I do think it stole from 1979's ""The In-Laws"" with Peter Falk and Alan Arkin, and I do think the earlier movie was better, but it's like an 8.5 or 9 versus a 10.",,Anonymous,Romance

A laugh a minute,"Well, I finally rented Meet the Parents and know why everyone loved it and can't wait for the sequel to come out which i understand will be out soon. First I love Robert Dinero and everything he does since Taxi Driver. Again, he was magnificent, but this time his character although straight, was one of the funniest, believable fathers i have seen on film. Knowing a friend in the CIA, i can truly believe how he went about interrogating Ben Stiller in some of the funniest moments i have seen in a movie. Ben Stiller was equally as funny as the son in law to be trying to impress the future parents, but only getting into trouble every step of the way. I loved the story, the characters and I really felt bad for Ben. What a fun movie and I will not wait until video for the sequel!",,Anonymous,Romance
Real Life Much More Exciting,"Years ago, movies USED to be funny. No more. Now they're just tasteless and painful, thrown together by Hollywood insiders who haven't had dinner in a normal middle class home in years and have no idea what life is like for most of us. Nowadays, the characters in movies are not inspired by real life flesh and blood people but by other characters in other movies (in this case I believe the moviemakers are mining Stiller's role in Something About Mary). In this picture, the main character is a nurse who has a smoking problem. Huh? I am sure there are a few nurses who smoke, but the vast majority of the ones I know don't, but hey, who cares about accuracy, this is a movie. And besides, a nurse who smokes is really funny, right? The father, played in his best scenery-chewing fashion by erstwhile Hollywood screen icon Robert DeNiro (is anyone besides me tired of seeing his grimacing face up on the big screen in every other movie?), is so over the top mean that it's hard to guess what's at all funny about him. He has pictures up in his den of himself with world leaders even though was actually a CIA agent with a cover. Whatever.And then there's the lame attempts at humor and comic timing in the plot. Caught in a lie about living on a farm, the Stiller character makes up a story that he once milked a cat (the bride-to-be's family has a beloved cat). Ho ho. The slow pacing of the movie only amplifies the staleness of the many bad jokes like this one.I would love to tell you what I thought of how the movie turned out, but I got tired of watching a bunch of actors in obnoxious, unfunny situations portraying people you would only see in a movie so I left early and went home to talk to some real characters. It wasn't a movie but it was much more entertaining.",,Anonymous,Romance
Trailers spoiled it for me...,This movie could have been entertaining had not all (and I mean practically ALL) the gags and jokes had not been in the trailers!

"Very, Very Funny!","This was even funnier than I had expected it to be. Yes, at first it started off dry, but it got really good the second that they arrived at the ""Parents"" House. This is when all of the good comedy happens. Ben Stiller is very funny as the nice-guy boyfriend that at sometimes it seems that he can do nothing right. The reason it is funny is, because most guys can relate to this. All boyfriends get nervous and screw-up when they are meeting the parents. They will either say something that is totally wrong for the occasion, or they will make a fool of themselves. Also, Robert DeNiro was suprisingly funny too. I highly recommend this movie. I really think that you will enjoy it. After all, it was directed by Jay Roach, the guy who directed both Austin Powers, so you know that it will be amusing. I give it a 10/10! Great Movie!",,Anonymous,Romance
"Entertaining, clever, excellent comedy!","It has been a while since a worthwhile comedy has graced us for the past year and this is certainly one good one! Meet the Parents is one which every person who has had jitters over meeting their loved one's parents at some point of time should watch! PArents of those loved ones are especially encouraged to watch - they may be surprised of what some of their potential son or daughter inlaws had to go through!!The story unfolds very well - with laughter at every turn and corner. Ben Stiller and Robert's characters are so well developed by the first 25 minutes,.. that the rest of the movie just becomes absolutely hillarous because you know that Greg (Ben) is so preditably going to muck up again! Interestingly, the third most well-developed and captivating character is the cat Jinx.. and she is definitely a wonder - a true co-conspirator to Greg's downfall.I give this movie an 8 out of 10 for comedic value.... Very well-directed, well-paced, exceptionally entertaining and the script is excellent! The write has certainly given a lot of thought to the story. Ben Stiller is a classic - an innocent screw up who always gets the girl (in the end). Robert De Niro gave a super performance... (as he mostly does). The cat deserves a 10!Watch it and enjoy it.

The Best Film of 2000,"I saw this on Christmas Eve of 2000 and it was the perfect start toChristmas. Not only is this one of the best scripts of the lastdecade, but it contains brilliant directing by Jay Roach(AustinPowers 1, 2 and 3) and excellent acting performances by BenStiller(There's Something About Mary, Zoolander) and Robert DeNiro(The Godfather 2, The Untouchables). The film follows GregFocker(Ben Stiller), a male nurse who wants to propose to hisgirlfriend Pam(Teri Pole) but finds out that he needs to meet herfather(Robert DeNiro) and ask for his permission beforeproposing. That's when everything starts to go wrong... One of thethings that's brilliant about this film is that it takes a real-lifeconcept(Meeting your future In-Laws for the first time) andmultiplies it by ten. The father is a former CIA guy who is spying onyou at any moment which is enough for anyone but then theydiscover the last name(Focker), the middle name(Gay-Lord) andyou also happen to be a clumsy fool.I can safely say that'll neverregret seeing Meet the Parents and i'm highly excited to see theupcoming ""Meet the Fockers""(Written by Chris and Paul Weitz,directors of American Pie and About A Boy)",,Anonymous,Romance

"Right, that's it, the wedding's off","This highly enjoyable comedy is based on a simple premise that we can all easily relate too, the first efforts of someone to introduce their partner to the prospective in-laws. Even if you haven't had this problem directly, it's easy to empathise, and surely everyone has been in the awkward situation of being a guest in someone's house and being petrified of putting a foot wrong. There is plenty of scope for humour with this situation and there are also several great set pieces as the weekend takes a turn for the disastrous. Even when they seem fairly predictable, each one hits home and gives a great payoff.Ben Stiller plays pretty much the same kind of role here as he did in 'There's Something About Mary', but that's no problem as his everyman likeability means you root for him throughout his tribulations. As Greg Fokker, he is desperate to impress his girlfriend's dad with a view to asking him for his blessing for her hand in marriage. Robert De Niro is great as the father who is not everything he first seems, and shows a knack for comic timing which you wouldn't expect of such a heavyweight actor.Even if the ending is slightly contrived, it's great fun getting there with laughs aplenty. One for those who can reminisce and those who will be filled with dread anticipation alike.",,Anonymous,Romance

What *is* nice is the acting, which is great all around!Having said that, I think that the dude (stiller) was shown more as a looser than anything else, what with letting the cat out when told not to do so ever, the smokes, the fire, the septic tank imbroglio, the ""you are a psycho, jack""... the list goes on and on. No wonder De Nero was p***ed at the dude, and father would be!

The idea sounded good, and I sort of wish I'd seen the original first, or perhaps, instead of Meet the Parents. I have no problems with the casting or the acting, but it's just that this movie never seems to come to a conclusion. Oh it does, but it seems a bit contrived, more like an afterthought.

Disappointing comedy squanders potential,"My guess is that people who love this film laugh at comedies because they know that they are supposed to be funny. It has its moments, but lacks. DeNiro is about as scary as a bag of bunnies. Why Stiller outappeals Wilson is unexplained. Why Stiller hangs around DeNiro after suffering the worst insults is sitcom crud writing, dragging out the story.    An obvious attempt to ride on SOMETHING ABOUT MARY's coattails.",,Anonymous,Romance
Good Vehicle for Stiller,"Satisfying 'forget your troubles' comedy that is loosely based on the funny French farce titled WHAT A SHITTY DAY.  Americanized to a stretched out TV sitcom with all the standardized mechanisms in place. Here Stiller plays your thirtysomething 'average Joe' off to meet his girlfriends parents whose father is especially picky, conservative, opinionated, and abrasive. This of course opens the floodgates for what is just one embarrassing (and uncomfortable) situation after another. As everything that can go wrong in meeting your girlfriends parents does.Runs so close to form that there's really no use to describe it further. Though there are a few 'laugh out loud' scenes.  They include a funny family water polo game and a inadvertent DeNiro/Stiller drag race.Stiller does well in what is obviously a tailored made vehicle.  He is this generations Bob Newhart/John Ritter.  Charmingly underplaying all the wackiness around him while still having just the right amount of pratfalls.DeNiro is good (of course) in a role where he finally gets to show his true age.  Danner though, as the mother, is completely wasted. Outside of jumping into a pool with all her clothes on, she has nothing funny to say or do. In fact the pet cat (named Jinx) comes off with a more interesting personality.Generally solid non-think entertainment with a quick chance to see that Phyllis George is still alive.  The former NFL TODAY/CBS MORNING NEWS hostess appears very briefly as a mother of another fiancee.",,Anonymous,Romance
A great believable comedy!,Ben Stiller really surprised me as he was able to hold his own quite well with Robert De Niro.  This believable and well relating comedy of real life moves well and as a date movie people can laugh at the inevitable.  Ben Stiller's personality in this movie is a lot like his character in 'There's Something About Mary'.  A nervous little guy with a streak of bad luck at almost every turn.  De Niro is grand as a seasoned veteran of the CIA and De Niro leads a cast in his usual towering fashion.  A nice movie with quirky jokes and some interesting slapstick.  It may also make lonely people feel happy that they don't have to deal with big families.,,Anonymous,Romance
A comedy for everyone,"Meet the Parents is a movie about a male nurse Greg Focker, played by Ben Stiller, who is meeting his girlfriend's parents before proposing to her. His girlfriend, Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo,) has an over protective father Jack Byrnes, who is a former CIA agent (Robert De Niro.)  From the moment that Jack and Greg meet, Jack feels that he is not good enough for his daughter. So when Jack discovers that Greg is a male nurse, he never lets him forget it by bringing it up in conversation every time that he can. Many hilarious parts of the movie come when Greg is caught in a situation where he has to lie or break the `circle of trust,' which happens quite often.  Greg goes from breaking Debbie Byrnes' nose days before she was getting married to losing the dear family cat, Jinxies, to catching the house on fire as well as flooding the backyard with fluids from the septic tank, nearly ruining the wedding.  But the funniest part of movie is when you discover that Greg's real name was Gaylord, which meant that his full name was Gaylord Focker.  Greg's name was an effective form of a cheep laugh because it was somewhat vulgar but not overly done, and you could always get out at least a giggle when you heard De Niro yell out `Focker!' Even the music couldn't save Greg, when asked about the song `Puff the magic dragon', Greg explained to Jack about its drug meaning, literally `puffing a marijuana cigarette.'  This gave the illusion that Greg was a pothead. But the audience sympathized with Greg when he was kicked out of Jack's house.  Most of the things that Greg did wrong were because he loved Pam. He was just trying to gain Jack's approval so that he could marry Pam. Only after Greg left did Jack realize that Greg was the one for Pam.  Thus the perfect ending happens when Greg is allowed to propose to Pam. Overall, I feel that De Niro was magnificent in portraying the overprotective father because he was quick to jump on the character of Greg at any instant and he gave the impression of the overpowering head of the family.  This movie had an excellent supporting cast with Ben Stiller and Teri Polo.  Stiller, who also starred in There's Something About Mary, kept up to his usual self, providing plenty of comedy. Director, Jay Roach, who also directed the Austin Powers movies, didn't try anything fancy to overwhelm us, but showed a more sophisticated comedy. On a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being a masterpiece and 1 being not worthy for the space on the bottom of my garbage can, I give Meet the Parents a 7.  The movie has a good cast, good directing and a good story line with plenty of laughs.  The only problem is it isn't one of those movies that you see and you are like `wow,' and it changes the way you look certain aspects in life. Overall, it is one of the funniest, if not the funniest movie that I have ever seen.",,Anonymous,Romance
All-round entertainment comedy,"This is great comedy that always keeps you guessing and holding your breath for the next gag. Robert De Niro slips into a humorous role of an ex-CIA man who is overbearingly suspicious of his daughter's intended (Ben Stiller) and does so with dignity and savoire faire. The outrageous story line as Stiller tries to impress his future father-in-law and digs himself in deeper and deeper is so well acted and well-told that it is easy to forgive the glitches (like, why would a sophisticated young woman with an impeccable background want to marry a total dick-head) and enjoy the film. One to laugh all the way through to from start to end.",,Anonymous,Romance
"DeNiro Almost Makes It Work, But Not Quite.","Over-rated would-be-comedy has Ben Stiller wanting to marry live-in girlfriend Teri Polo, but there is only one obstacle: meeting her parents (Robert DeNiro and Blythe Danner). Naturally nothing goes right and Stiller ends up being the target of ex-CIA operative DeNiro who tries hard to carry the film by himself but has only minimal success. Silly situations galore will put a smile on your face, but don't expect anything remotely special. Only average. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,Romance
