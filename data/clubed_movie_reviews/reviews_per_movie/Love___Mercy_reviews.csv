better for Dano to play both,"This is the story of Brian Wilson during two time periods. In 1964, Brian Wilson (Paul Dano) has a panic attack and quits touring with the band. Instead he concentrates on writing for the new record Pet Sounds. He struggles from his abusive father and starts hearing voices. In the 80s, Brian (John Cusack) is under the control of his therapist Dr. Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti). He buys a car from saleswoman Melinda Ledbetter (Elizabeth Banks) who eventually breaks Landy's hold on him.This is a compelling biopic of an interesting person. Paul Dano really hits it out of the park. His section has some great scenes. On its own, John Cusack does a great job. Put together, I can't help but think that Cusack is doing a passable imitation of Dano's performance. I'm not judging their relative acting skills. I just think that Dano has always played this type of character and he simply fits better. I'm certain that Dano would be nominated for an Oscar if he played both time periods. Landy is the villain of the piece and Giamatti plays him with gusto. For a more nuanced character, the movie needs to show his character saving Brian at the beginning. Splitting the time period so neatly does lessen some important sections of Brian's life.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"God only knows, this is a must see film","Personal genius has been brilliantly portrayed in film before: ""A Beautiful Mind"" for maths; ""Amadeus"" for classical music; and more recently ""A Theory of Everything"" for cosmology. Behind such genius is often a degree of dysfunction, if not borderline madness.Here with ""Love and Mercy"" we get an insight into the creative churning of Wilson's tortured mind. But it is very much a time-banded view, focused on two key periods of his life: 1966, with Paul Dano (""12 Years a Slave""; ""Looper"") playing Wilson, and the 1990's where Wilson – severely drug-damaged, mentally ill and now played by John Cusack - is being taken for a ride by an unscrupulous and dangerous psychiatrist, Dr Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti). Playing a key role in his recovery is car saleswoman Melinda Ledbetter (Elizabeth Banks) who Wilson desperately latches onto as a drowning man might grab a life-vest.Whilst the film could be described as a game of two halves, this is not how it is played out. We jump between both eras without warning, which works extremely well in maintaining the interest in the two parallel stories.In biopic terms, the 60's segments are probably the more gripping, providing a riveting insight into the production techniques of the iconic ""Pet Sounds"" album, frequently cited as one of the most innovative and creative albums ever released. The film also features superbly recreated 'old footage' (cinematography by Robert D. Yeoman) showing Beach Boy TV slots and video productions. Wilson's genius is neatly reflected through the admiration of the session musicians: they'd ""played with them all"" – Sinatra, Presley, Sam Cooke, etc – but Wilson was something else entirely.Paul Dano is just superb as the troubled youngster, physically and mentally abused by his father (an excellent Bill Camp) and exhibiting mental instability even before the dangers of LSD become evident. His slide into near insanity is brilliantly reflected in an audio soundscape that merges snatched Beach Boy fragments and natural sounds into a cacophony. If Edward Tize and his sound department doesn't get nominated for an Oscar for Best Sound Mixing there is no justice in the world.In the 90's segments, Cusack delivers his best performance in years as the older Wilson. And after being rude about Elizabeth Banks' directing skills for ""Pitch Perfect 2"", I feel I have to express my admiration for her portrayal of perplexed astonishment as Melinda, a woman with a mission. Both extremely subtle and utterly enjoyable performances.In contrast, the excellent Giamatti seems rather over the top as the scheming Landy, although internet articles suggest that it is a scarily accurate portrayal of the degree of control he exerted.Directed by Bill Pohlad (someone normally found in the production office), it's difficult to fault such a lovingly crafted film. The pre-credits reference to a 'building scream' (I assume relating to the 'goose-bumpy' bit of ""Good Vibrations"") is never resolved. And (as I rather missed it in the film) the motives for Landy's extreme actions are a bit obscure (in reality, the Wilson family later discovered he was named as a 70% beneficiary in Wilson's will). However, this film, which deserved a broader and better-publicised release, stands as a superb tribute to an iconic musician and comes with a ""highly recommended"" from me.(If you enjoyed this review, please see the illustrated version at bob-the-movie-man.com and enter your email address to receive future reviews.

"""Love and Mercy"" makes me SMiLE","Anyone who knows me knows my favorite band is The Beach Boys, and my favorite musician is their leader, Brian Wilson. I first got deep into their music last November when I heard their album SMiLE, an album which wasn't officially released until 45 years after its conception and recording. It was worth the wait, as I consider it the best album I've ever heard.I found out that a biopic of Wilson was in the works, and would be screening at SXSW with Wilson in attendance. I knew I had to go and see this film. The experience is one that will stick with me for the rest of my life as one of the most emotionally powerful events I have been a part of.Love and Mercy is the story of The Beach Boys' founder Brian Wilson. The film chronicles his rise to fame in the 1960's and the his decline into mental illness, and his escape from the control of his therapist in the 1980's.Paul Dano plays Wilson in the 1960's, and John Cusack plays him in the 1980's. It also stars Elizabeth Banks as Wilson's future wife, Melinda Ledbetter, and Paul Giamatti as his therapist, Eugene Landy.Paul Dano exudes the boyish look of young Wilson perfectly. He relearned how to play piano for the role, and sings much of the music in the film.His performance is hard to watch at times because of how depressing it is seeing him devolve from an energetic, fun young man into a tortured, drained artist. Dano handles the role with passion and care, and his performance never feels forced or fake.When Wilson begins to suffer a panic attack, anyone who's had one will feel deeply for him. When he starts to have physical symptoms of depression after years of physical and mental abuse from his father and disapproval of his musical direction from fellow band mate Mike Love, Dano portrays the hurt that comes from those events with subtle facial expressions and natural transition.John Cusack looks less like Wilson physically, but his performance may be even more complex. His Wilson has been to the bottom, and he brilliantly portrays how challenging it is to rebuild your life after going through mental and physical anguish.Elizabeth Banks has a great departure from her more well known comedic film roles, and as Ledbetter, she shows her strength and respect for the man she loves through actions and subtle expressions instead of overt, over the top dialog.Paul Giamatti has the most campy role in the film as Eugene Landy, but this is unfortunately how Landy was in real life. He was as violent and controlling over Wilson's life as the movie portrays, so his abusive, manipulative, angering performance is highly accurate.One of the best things about Love and Mercy is that it doesn't exaggerate or make up events to make the film more interesting. The filmmakers trust the strength of its source material is interesting enough to make for a great story.The storytelling structure of the movie is interesting and risky. The film jumps from the 60's to the 80's without warning, and it works. The slightly askew technique allows the audience to experience the downfall and uprising of Wilson's life simultaneously, and allows the movie to end on a happy note.One complaint people have is that the film skips over the 1970's, Wilson's most tumultuous period in which he weighed 300 pounds and spent the majority of three years in bed, crippled by depression and drug addiction. However, this allows the audience to examine the reasons for his downfall and redemption instead of indulging in the horrible escapism Wilson turned to.Beach Boys fans will appreciate the movie more than the average film-goer. Mike Love in hats, dancing, and mentioning ""the formula""? Check. Drug tent and piano in the sandbox in Wilson's living room? Check. The infamous ""Fire"" session? Check. Everything is on point, from the scarily accurate wardrobe down to recreating the ""Sloop John B."" and ""Surf's Up"" promo videos shot for shot. It's these moments that show the film was made by fans with an attention for detail.Almost every song on the album Pet Sounds is featured in the film somewhere. Seeing Wilson's unorthodox recording techniques is such a pleasure for music nerds.Cinematographer Robert Yeoman, best known for creating the look of Wes Anderson's films, blends stylistic tone with realistic camera work, creating a sense of false nostalgia that is surreal yet inviting and intense.Composer Atticus Ross works wonders with the score, using a great wealth of Wilson's music in different ways and choosing songs that fit with the emotional tone of the scene brilliantly. Hearing the instrumental version of ""Don't Talk"" play as Wilson takes LSD for the first time is haunting. Witnessing the song ""Til' I Die"" play over a surreal, Kubrickian scene in which Wilson has an epiphany made me cry because of the powerful combination of imagery and music.The film is being released on June 5, to capitalize on The Beach Boys music being a staple of the summer, but it feels more like a Thanksgiving release to me. The cinematography, acting, script, and score are all Oscar worthy in my opinion, but the film may get lost in the race to other contenders, which is a shame.Love and Mercy is an awesome, unorthodox biopic that takes risks with form and narrative that has strong performances, script, cinematography, and of course, an amazing soundtrack. It will expose young people to the brilliance of Wilson's music and give older fans an insight into why Wilson is the poster boy for using creativity as an escape and an outlet from the pain of life and mental illness.And seriously, listen to the album SMiLE.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"A complex, unorthodox and emotionally resonant biopic.","While I generally enjoy most music biopics, it's hard to argue with the fact that most of them tend to subscribe to a very familiar pattern. Every once in awhile, a film comes along that break the mold - Todd Haynes did it in 2007 with I'm Not There, which featured six different actors portraying Bob Dylan at various points in his career. That film's writer, Oren Moverman, offers a similarly unconventional approach to Love & Mercy, which hones in on two critical periods during the life of Beach Boys songwriter Brian Wilson.We first encounter Brian (Paul Dano) during the 1960s, shortly before the band is scheduled to head out for a tour of Japan. Reluctant to return to the road, Brian convinces his brothers that he belongs at home in the studio, where he'll be more effective at creating the band's next album. The boys finally acquiesce, and Brian hires a collection of studio musicians to begin crafting what would ultimately become Pet Sounds.Our next encounter with Brian comes during the 1980s, where he's portrayed by John Cusack. Brian meets, and attempts to court, Cadillac saleswoman Melinda Ledbetter (Elizabeth Banks), but she quickly discovers that Brian's life is not his own when she meets Dr. Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti), his therapist and legal guardian. Landy controls every aspect of Brian's existence, from his diet to his personal relationships, all the while insisting that he has Brian's best interests at heart.The film frequently cuts between these two periods in Brian's life. We see the depths of his imagination and creativity as he employs a range of nontraditional elements to record Pet Sounds, desperately trying to bring to life the music he hears in his head, and all the while sliding further and further into the grip of severe mental illness. And we see the results of that illness, as Brian becomes a timid, broken man, cut off from his friends and family, allowing himself to be controlled and manipulated, and never able to find peace.Director Bill Pohlad does a marvelous job of illustrating the parallels between each on screen version of Brian Wilson, and both actors give brilliant, emotional performances. Dano in particular turns in what can arguably be called the best work of his career, perfectly embodying Brian's childlike glee as he excitedly flits around the studio, and capturing the anguish and desperation as his mind continues to deteriorate.Unorthodox in its approach and admirable in its complexity, Love & Mercy wisely chooses not to paint a definitive portrait of a man whose life couldn't possibly be summed up in a two-hour film. By confining the narrative to these two specific chapters, we're able to go far beyond the surface and reveal the inner workings of a tortured genius, and shed light on a story that few people are familiar with. Love & Mercy is a truly exceptional film about the internal and external struggles of a truly exceptional person, and is one of the most emotionally resonant experiences I've had with a film this year.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
God Only Knows,"Greetings again from the darkness. Beach Boys fans may struggle a bit with this one since the light-hearted, airy feel to the ""Fun, Fun, Fun"" music of the band is mostly absent. Instead, director Bill Pohlad pulls back the curtain on the emotional and mental struggles of visionary songwriter Brian Wilson  the band's creative force.In an unusual artistic approach, Paul Dano plays Brian from the 1960's period that resulted in the revolutionary Pet Sounds album and the ongoing battle with his domineering father; while John Cusack plays Brian from the late 1980's - his most creatively bankrupt period and the subsequent debilitating influence of quackster psychologist Dr. Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti).The two periods are blended together as we (and Brian) bounce back and forth between the struggle of a budding musical genius working to release the sounds in his head, and a middle aged man so heavily medicated that speaking, eating and even getting out of bed are such overwhelming obstacles that music rarely registers. It's during the latter period that Brian is truly at the mercy of Dr. Eugene Landy. Giamatti sports a floppy wig and proceeds to rage at Brian while trying to charm Melinda (Elizabeth Banks), Brian's new romantic interest. Knowing this disgusting period was part of Brian's life only adds to the anger and frustration we feel  not just as fans, but as human beings.What sets this biopic apart is actually the performance of Dano and the peek inside the process of Brian's genius. Watching Brian work the musicians and mold the music on the fly is breath-taking, even though we see the challenges of his early mental issues. It's a joy to see a tribute to the studio session players known as ""The Wrecking Crew""  themselves the subject of a recent stellar documentary. It's during this period that the Wilson brothers' father (played by Bill Camp) constantly derides Brian and his ""new"" music. There is also some insight into the Brian vs Mike Love battles – Brian exploring his creative music, while Mike just wants to keep cashing in with their expected ""fun"" style.Some may find the two-headed approach to be distracting, but it drives home the point of what a different man he was in comparing the mid-1960's to the late 1980's. Mostly, I found the 1960's portion to be an insight into what we hear from so many geniuses, regardless of their specialty. Brian says it's like ""Someone is inside me. Not me."" His struggles are non-relatable to others – even his brothers, and especially his dad. What is mostly a look at the darkness behind the ""sunny"" music, does come with real life redemption courtesy of Melinda's strength  and witnessed in the video shown over the closing credits.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Band of Brothers,"I had no idea what this film was about. I thought it would be another musical biopic like ""Walk the Line"" or ""Ray"". It's nothing like those movies. This is the most intense, in-depth, and soulful look at the fragility of the creative mind since ""All That Jazz"". ""All That Jazz"" is the best film ever made about choreography and dance, this is the best film ever made about rock 'n roll. Dark, often depressing, but also exhilarating, ""Love & Mercy"", like ""All That Jazz"", captures the sense of loneliness and despair many creative geniuses suffer. And when the music starts, it's cool, loud, and breathtaking. ""A Beautiful Mind"" is the best film ever made about mental illness, because it's an unflinching and compassionate portrait rendered with remarkable artistic skill by director Ron Howard and acted by Russell Crowe. ""Love & Mercy"" is its equal: Director Bill Pohlad tells an equally moving story of a man's mind falling apart, every bit as skillfully as Ron Howard, and the performances by Paul Dano and John Cusack are each Oscar worthy - as was Russell Crowe's. And first and foremost, I found it to be one of the most painful and frightening portrayals of a tyrannical father ever put on film. Brian Wilson was surrounded by monsters, real and imaginary. In many ways the Beach Boys were a performing family, like the Osmonds or the Jackson 5, a band of brothers at the mercy of a brutal father. I could go on and on,there's a lot going on here - it's a terrific love story too - this movie delivers on so many levels.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
The Beach Boys need a TV series not just a movie,"An interesting look at Brian Wilson, but it pretty much ignores his brothers. It's focused on him because his wife only knew the older Brian, and in spite of a decent piece of time shifting, it shrinks the story down. Both Dano and Cusack are great. Giamatti is.. Giamatti.What we need is a TV series because there is so much missing here. Manson, Dennis's death, the drugs, Reagan. They could also do one on Landy: shrink to the stars.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A film about the two things we're constantly bound by,"It's no secret that with the plethora of biopics we get every year, there is a formula that many of them follow. Just last year, we got to see the stories of a wayward soul who ventured out on a soul-cleansing journey through the mountains, a computer genius who cracked a presumably unbreakable code during war times, one of the deadliest snipers in American history, and one of funk's greatest musicians told on film. Bill Pohland's ""Love & Mercy,"" concerning the life of Beach Boys singer Brian Wilson, is bound to be written off by some as another interchangeable biopic, but if you've seen so much as a trailer for this film, you know this is something deeper, richer, and more complex than formula could ever begin to handle.""Love & Mercy"" focuses on two times pieced together, as Pohland and the writing team of Michael Alan Lerner and Oren Moverman segway between the ""past"" Brian Wilson, played by Paul Dano, and the ""future"" Brian Wilson, played by John Cusack, never telling us exactly where the present lies. We follow Wilson during his rise with his brothers and friends to make The Beach Boys one of America's most successful boy bands in the 1960's. Despite initial success with The Beach Boys, following a severe panic attack, Wilson resigns from the band to focus on writing back home in California. He's convinced he has found the formula for ""the greatest rock album ever,"" experimenting with a plethora of different melodies, instruments, and lyrics to create something one can not only hear and enjoy, but feel.While undergoing this arduous process, Wilson is met with little vocal support. He receives the casual head nods from most of his bandmates, with the exception of Michael Love (Jake Abel), who constantly criticizes his creative decisions, and his father, who is still bitter after being fired by his own son. While focusing on this, we frequently jump into Brian's life in the future, where he is placed under the care of Dr. Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti in another brutal but compelling role), who over-medicates and physically and mentally abuses him. Brian winds up meeting and falling for a Cadillac saleswoman named Melinda Ledbetter (Elizabeth Banks), who constantly wants to be with him but finds Dr. Landy to be a smothering force preventing their connection from growing.Pohland's experimental structure for ""Love & Mercy"" is nothing shy of remarkable, but the fact that it doesn't make the film feel off balance or tonally uneven is a total cinematic anomaly. While frequently weaving through different time periods seems ripe for complete chaos for a film trying to keep a consistent tone, ""Love & Mercy"" handles the challenge beautifully, humanizing Brian regardless of his age and working to find the core idea in each scene.I've long asserted that Paul Dano is one of the finest actors in cinema today and ""Love & Mercy"" is another link in his ever-growing chain of terrific performances. Similar to his role in ""Prisoners,"" Dano must remain relatively expressionless and look as if nothing is occurring inside his head, when really, there is too much going on in his head to accurately communicate. Dano, once again, blindsides the audience by taking a role that seems too facile to carry a film and making it a fleshed out, thoroughly impressive performance. John Cusack also delivers a role much like Dano, channeling his kind of emptiness so well that it's like watching two actors in different time periods of their life playing a character in different time periods of his own life. The result is a mesmerizing, surreal experience.""Love & Mercy""'s vignette-style structure examines the heartbreak, the joy, the contentment, and the unmatched physical and mental pressure of Brian in a remarkably tender way. Robert Yeoman's cinematography also paints a picture that, while littered with nostalgia in look, costume design, and general vibes, captures Brian's hectic environment so affectionately that it becomes strangely beautiful. Through all of Brian's madness, his unpredictable panic attacks, episodes of rage, and the contemptuous relationship with his father, Pohland searches to find attributes of Brian to showcase in a way that's impacting.Calling ""Love & Mercy"" a ""mesmerizing, surreal experience"" is an appropriate, if ostensibly exaggerating, summation. Similar to how Brian can't always communicate the beauty behind the sound of his music, I can't quite put my finger on what works with this film and in what manner. This film, however, snuck up on me in a way that was remarkably subtle but lasting and, even though it's been several days since I've seen it, the effect remains strong in a way that only enhances the film's compelling and unique aura.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Could have been a great film,"Brian Wilson's story is worthy of a movie. Neither his creative genius or his mental illness were appreciated until years after the fact. His childhood, as was Michael Jackson's 15 years later , shaped the adult life he inherited. His creative genius allowed and encouraged him to be used by others, including the other ""Beach Boys"". Mike Love is finally exposed in this film. The story is very interesting. The casting very good, the acting excellent. John Cusack hasn't been this good maybe never. Elizabeth Banks will be a feature actor after this film. Dano did a very good job. Giamarti might have been a little over the top but to someone who appreciates the Beach Boys and music in general, the scenes from the recording studio are priceless. My fault finding with this movie are the direction and editing. Too long, too dry in spots. A better director would have won an Academy Award with this story",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Not all sunny at the beach,The performances of both Paul Dano and John Cusak are Oscar worthy. It's hard to believe all that sunny happy music came from such a dark place. Long heralded as a genius to see Brian Wilson during the making of Pet Sounds is astonishing. To see Brian Wilson later is heart wrenching. Stay for the credits. You will go back to listen to Pet Sounds with a whole new appreciation. Elizabeth Banks also gives a first rate performance as his girlfriend. It really is amazing to see how John Cusak captured Brian's mannerisms and voice. The way the story is told is unique in it's mix of the use of both actors. Should be a tough contender come awards season next year.,9.0,Anonymous,Music
Dark Movie Line That  Leaves out Much,"Perhaps a biographical movie should not be expected to be a comprehensive story. Nevertheless, when flash-backs are so abundantly used that even the exact time period being recounted is unclear, and when many important details of the characters life (though important) are omitted (such as the weight gain, alcohol and drug abuse - which are referred to but not depicted), the viewer may start to wonder how much of this movie is presented as it is for dramatic effect. And drama is the one thing the movie certainly has, even though it is a very dark tale. After watching it you have to wonder if the missing parts were deliberately excised because they would not further the drama and if scenes were added that were not part of Brian's life.Maybe those of us who have a compelling interest should just go out and read a book. But for those not quite so interested a more accurate portrayal might have improved the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Cusack is not Brian anybody!,"I met Brian Wilson several times. All four stars go to Paul Dano, who tries and does well as young Brian, but no one can suspend disbelief so far as to accept John Cusack, a great actor in the right situation, as Brian anybody. It's a ridiculous stretch to begin with. Brian himself was able to sit through this film, though how, I cannot imagine. Still, Brian dances to his own imagination, so I wouldn't presume to determine his impression of it. Nothing wrong with the film's values, only that the flip-flop age approach, Dano as young Brian, Cusack as older Brian, simply doesn't work, because even a fine actor like Cusack cannot achieve any believable resemblance to Wilson or his persona - he is just the wrong choice to pull off such a huge conceit. Best turn to ""Brian Wilson: I Just Wasn't Made For These Times"" (1995) and let the actual man do his job. Director Bill Pohlad is no slouch, but next time, perhaps a bit more looking before taking a leap the size of this one.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
This is the best music biopic since Immortal Beloved,"It's almost impossible to portray the work involved in making a great song in a movie. Love and Mercy accomplishes that and so much more. It is an emotional juggernaut that every boomer should enjoy. Dano and Cusack nail the early and later Wilson. Elizabeth Banks holds the whole thing together with the ""flash forwards"" featuring her pitch-perfect performance.The typical music biopic is a formula of rising star gets drugged out, falls from the pinnacle and either dies an early death or maybe makes a comeback after getting sober. This movie explains WHY all those things happened to Brian Wilson and does it with an unblinking eye. It treats the audience like they have brains.This movie is not for the faint-hearted. It tells it like it was. Some very sad episodes, but an ending worth waiting for. Go see it.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
The Brian Wilson Story,"When done right, a biopic film can be quite a sight to behold for the potential it is to combine drama, real-life, and music. Fortunately, ""Love & Mercy"" is most definitely done right, relaying the story of Brian Wilson and his relation to the band he created...The Beach Boys.For a basic plot summary, ""Love & Mercy"" tells an intertwining dual-narrative tale: A young Brian Wilson (Paul Dano) is rising to fame with The Beach Boys, while at the same time succumbing to his mental demons. While the rest of the band wants to ""ride the wave"" (pun intended) of their skyrocketing success, Brian feels artistically compelled (one might say maniacally driven) to do his own thing. An alcoholic and un-supportive father (played by Bill Camp) finally pushes Brian over the edge, prompting him to shack up in his room for years on end. Fast-forward about 30 years into the future and Wilson (John Cusack), now quite an odd fellow but at least out in society again, happens to meet a car saleswoman named Melinda Ledbetter (Elizabeth Banks) and strike up a friendship (that may also be a bit romantic). Melinda discovers that Brian is now closely watched (guarded) by one Dr. Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti), on a strict program of pills and tough discipline. The doctor says it is for Brian's own good, but Melinda has her own serious doubts about that.The first thing that needs to be understood about ""Love & Mercy"" is that it isn't a ""Beach Boys biopic"". It's a ""Brian Wilson biopic"". Sure, the other Beach Boys members are prominently featured as is their music throughout, but the narrative focus is squarely on Brian Wilson. So, those looking for a retrospective on the history of the group might be a little disappointed.This is probably a good choice, however, as Brian's story is probably the most interesting thing TO focus on. From his relationships to family, friends, fellow band members, and (in the later years) society as a whole, Brian battled mental illness and extreme anxiety. I hadn't realized that he also looked to be severely taken advantage of by Dr. Landy. Just a fascinating human-interest story all-around.Like all great musical biopics, ""Love & Mercy"" needed great music and got exactly that! You'll be listening to Beach Boys tunes for awhile after the viewing is over. The acting is also very convincing. Both the young/old Wilson actors are spot-on, while Banks shows she can hold down a very serious, emotional role (moving away from the dirty rom-coms and crazy Effie character from the Hunger Games she had come to be known for). Of course, it's a historical picture, so Giamatti is in it (!).About the only caveat I could give to this film is that it might not play quite as well if you know nothing about the Beach Boys or Brian Wilson. I knew the basic story going in, so was able to pick up on all the requisite beats. I'd be interested to hear if others (who know nothing about the topic) were able to do the same.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed ""Love & Mercy"" for its combination of drama, music, and historical realism. The scenes from the past are capable of producing great nostalgia, while those set in Wilson's ""older years"" tell a compelling story that many may not know.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Not a Traditional Biopic (Which Is Good) But Not Completely Successful Either,"""Love & Mercy"" thankfully avoids the pitfalls that plague most other blah biopics, eschewing the device of taking us through the troubled childhood up through the inspirational finale of whatever famous person's life happens to be the film's subject. While Brian Wilson is the main subject of the film, the movie isn't so much about him as it about his contributions to the Beach Boys' phenomenal success as a band. We don't learn his life story; we witness instead how one of the most troubled passages of his personal life coincided with one of the most fertile period for the group. However, while I was relieved that this didn't end up being a paint by numbers biopic like every other biopic put to screen, I did feel like the filmmakers didn't quite know how to fill the gap where a different movie would have inserted all of the traditional biopic material. Paul Dano and John Cusack give fine performances as the young and older, respectively, Brian Wilson, but there isn't a lot of story to tell here, certainly not enough to warrant the film's 2+ hour running time. The film is at its best when it's depicting the jam sessions during which Wilson came up with some of the Beach Boys' most iconic tunes, but the parts of the film that chronicle the tug-of-war between Wilson's girlfriend (played likeably by Elizabeth Banks) and his doctor (played loathsomely by Paul Giammati) turn into a slog, and unfortunately these make up the bulk of the movie.And it's odd that a movie about the Beach Boys would feature so little of their music.Grade: B+",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"More than a biopic, about someome who was more than a pop star","The rock biopic has a very traditional and boring format, including the scene where, at the height of their troubles, the protagonist writes their most famous song from bitter personal experience, and ending with the claim at the credits that the hero, in real life, ended up universally loved and admired. 'Love and Mercy', based on the life of Beach Boy Brian Wilson, has the ending, but is otherwise much more interesting. Wilson had serious issues with his mental health, not helped by a heartless father, band mates who didn't understand his musical direction, and an abusive therapist. He also constructed the often ground-breaking arrangements of his songs not by jamming with a group, but by composing them entirely within his head. What was it like to be Brian Wilson? The movie actually does quite a good job of suggesting an answer. It helps that, while John Cusack (playing Brian in middle age), looks nothing like him, Paul Dano (playing the younger man) is a dead ringer. While undoubtedly complementary to its subject, 'Love and Mercy' is a proper movie, not just fan-service; and this rises far above the majority of films in its genre.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Somewhat Underwhelming,"Paul Dano is a fantastic actor, and I think Hollywood has started to realize that over the past few years. If I remember correctly, the first thing I ever saw him in was a small little movie called ""Ruby Sparks"". I had never seen this guy before, but I thought he was pretty incredible. And from that day on, I made it my mission to see almost everything he's ever been in. Of course, a few of them have slipped through the cracks, but I've seen the good majority of his on-screen work. Some of my personal favorites include the aforementioned as well as his roles in ""The Extra Man"" and ""Meek's Cutoff"". And his performance in ""Love & Mercy"" is no different, I just wish there was more of it.The film itself is split directly down the middle. As you may know, it's the story of Brian Wilson (otherwise known as the frontman for The Beach Boys). But it's by no means chronologically told. We cut to and fro from Brian's formative years as a musician to his later days when he seems to be manipulated by a greedy therapist out to swindle him. In his younger years, he's excellently played by Paul Dano, with John Cusack stepping in for the later part of his life. These are two different stories, and two different movies at that.The one that I was constantly enjoying and couldn't get enough of was his early years of dealing with quick success, and trying to follow up on that with more genuine music that spoke to the listener. This struggle, the one that is parleyed with his confusion and fractured being that came about as he was much older, is far more interesting. John Cusack definitely tries his best along with Elizabeth Banks to capture that fractured state - and turns in a commendable performance along the way - but it simply can't measure up to the electricity that is seen when Dano emerges. The result is a somewhat underwhelming movie, one that most definitely would've been better if entirely focused on one part of his life. However, one thing is certainly made clear, Paul Dano is sensational.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Left out that his GF was 14 years okd,"What happened to him with his therapist was absolutely horrific. But they left out the part where he dated and was creepily obsessed with underage girls. The woman playing his girlfriend in the film was aged up, to an appropriate age, which is not how it was in real life. I also read that he was a terrible person to other people and liked to play weird kind games. So I can't really feel too bad for someone who was clearly disturbed and did gross things. And this movie sweeps the whole kiddie thing under the rug. I know that a lot of male rock stars did this back then but it ain't cool and if something is meant to be a biopic then they should be honest.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
On the crest of a wave,"Love & Mercy is the story of Brian Wilson, the creative heart and also the troubled mind of The Beach Boys and it takes place in two time streams.Paul Dano plays the younger Brian who slowly descents into madness (with the help of drugs and booze not quiet touched in the film) as he moves away from the popular west coast surf sound and into the more experimental Pet Sounds album. This portion of the film was the best as we see the recording and singing process and his interaction with the rest of the band and his stern, overpowering father who sold away his publishing rights.John Cusack is the older Wilson, his scenes are set in the 1980s when he is under the care and medications of his overpowering, manipulative and Svengali like psychotherapist, Dr Landy (Paul Giamatti.) Love, understanding and eventual escape from the clutches of Dr Landy comes from (Melinda Ledbetter) Elizabeth Banks, a Cadillac car saleswoman who went on to become his wife.The film was just too disjointed and uneven with the Cusack segments being weaker, not helped that his performance was overshadowed by Banks and Giamatti who with his wig looked scarily similar to Phil Spector.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
"Amazing, Sad and Deserving","One of the best musical biopic I have seen. Love and Mercy gives us a glimpse of the creative genius of one Brian Wilson and his long struggle with mental health. We see him at the height of his songwriting, from the production of ""Pet Sounds"" and the factors that drove Brian to his debilitating illness and the system, that meant to take advantage and abuse. As for the star of the show, Paul Dano was born for this role, cementing his place as one of the best up and coming actors.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Music and madness,"A biopic of, and a homage to, Brian Wilson. Most of the time it succeeds in avoiding the tackiness of the genre because of the structure of its screenplay, which splits Brian into two (occasionally three, counting fleeting appearances of him as a child). This strategy was used to great effect (and with a larger number of 'selves') in He's Not There, Todd Haynes' fascinating film about Bob Dylan, and I'm sure it's no accident that Oren Moverman, Haynes' collaborator on the screenplay of that movie, is a co-author of Love & Mercy.The two Brians here are brilliantly played by Paul Dano and John Cusack, two of Hollywood's finest. Dano, with more to chew on, is especially noteworthy. They are supported superbly by Elizabeth Banks' quiet compassion and Paul Giamatti's dangerous volatility. John Camp contributes a fine performance as Wilson's violent, emotionally blackmailing father.Another star of Love & Mercy is its production design, which makes brilliantly expressive use of colour contrasts. And of course there's the music, the sound of The Beach Boys. The scenes recreating their studio sessions are simultaneously celebratory and poignant, especially for those of us who were young when these wonderful songs first emerged.But, to its credit, the movie is not a nostalgia-fest. Having avoided that trap, however, it occasionally falls into another, making connections between madness and genius that can't ever be proved: were Wilson's mental illness or his drug abuse contributors to his visionary talent? No one can know. The movie tries to have it both ways by suggesting that LSD was an influence on Pet Sounds, while also portraying Brian's illness as an obstacle to the expression of his gift. This apart, the screenplay, ably directed by Bill Pohlad, is pretty strong.Best for me is a wonderful conversation between Wilson-Dano and his session drummer. The latter has played with 'em all - Elvis, Phil Spector, Sam Cooke - but tells Brian that he's better than any of them. The look of modest yet profound gratitude on Dano's face powerfully packs the lack of praise he's had from his father, the incomprehension of his brothers and cousin (his fellow Beach Boys) at the depth of his talent, and his desperate need for love. In one respect this is quite a clichéd scene in terms of what the drummer actually says, but the film has created a context in which Wilson's whole dilemma is suddenly made vivid, an opportunity which Dano, a sensitive and gifted actor, seizes and transforms into something great.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Beautiful, Gripping, Eerie","There have been plenty of great musician biopics over the years, but I can't remember there being two incredible ones in the same year. Straight Outta Compton and Love & Mercy are two very different films in terms of structure and story for that matter, but both are equally as gripping and satisfying.Focusing mostly solely on Brian Wilson, The Beach Boys leader, Love & Mercy tells the story of Brian in the early days of the band, and also his days in his 40's when his therapist controlled most of his life. The film's structure goes back and forth between these two eras with Paul Dano playing Wilson in his early days and John Cusack later on. Both of the performances exude a great amount of pain and suffering while still feeling relatable at the same time. Bill Pohlad also deserves a lot of credit for his ability to weave the two time periods together in seamless fashion.The music of The Beach Boys will suck you in from the start, but it's really the writing, direction, and performances that keep you watching. The eerie tone is not that of a mainstream film, but that's a good correlation to the not-so-mainstream 'Pet Sounds' album the group worked on for a majority of the early years scenes. The film also does a good job of portraying the crazy genius that Brian Wilson was. His ability to mix song structure and break the norm of music at that time and even stray away from where the group was is unparalleled and extremely risky.Paul Giamatti plays a similar back-stabbing character as he does in Straight Outta Compton, but it fits perfectly for his strengths. Really, there aren't any real weaknesses of this film. It's captivating throughout and the performances may even be worthy of some recognition come awards season. A job well done.+Both lead performances+Strange tone+Bill Pohlad's consistent direction+Who doesn't love the music?8.2/10",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Wanted more from this,"As a fan of the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson in particular, I was eager to see this movie. Brian is a guy with an enormous musical talent. He had quite an abusive upbringing from his father - but in the movie he says that if he hadn't had that amount of discipline from his father, he may never have achieved the greatness that he did.The movie does jump around quite a bit - some people may struggle with that if they don't know their history. What was the final edit, is generally very good and worthwhile. It sympathetically showed Brian's mental struggles alongside his genius. He is a very fragile person but in his own world of music he has some confidence.I wish we got to learn how this creep of a psychotherapist got into Brian's life and was able to take over in the way that he did. I'm just baffled that surviving family members and the band didn't get more involved to stop this getting out of control in the way that it did. There's huge gaps in the story - and maybe that's because Brian himself is unable to fill them himself as there were a number of years where he was barely able to function.The movie will have natural appeal to Beach Boys/Brian Wilson fans, but I'm not sure it will have much appeal to outsiders.I am delighted that Brian has got his life back and is able to perform and write in a way that's comfortable for him. He seems to be at the best place in his head that he's ever been and seems to have a good grasp on reality.Worthwhile but could have been a little better.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Beach Boys Movie (minus the songs),"I've been a big Beach Boys fan since the 60's. Love their sound and the energy in their music, so I can tell you how disappointed I was to find out someone made a BB movie and didn't put any songs in. Oh there were a few snippets here and there and several shots of their music in the making with studio scenes, but what a missed opportunity.I know, I know. It was supposed to be about Brian Wilson's struggle with mental disorder and drugs, etc., but let's face it - he wrote all those songs about cars, surfing and beach parties that captured the imagination of a young guy from New York and I was waiting to hear some of them. What saved the movie for me was John Cusack, who played the older Brian and who I enjoy very much. He did his best as did Paul Giamatti as his mentor/bully. Elizabeth Banks was great eye candy.Director Pohlad did further damage in my estimation by cutting back and forth between Early Years Brian and Older Brian too frequently. Just as you would get absorbed in one episode he would cut to the other one, and did it over and over. Ultimately it didn't matter, though. I was waiting for a song or two anyway.",,Anonymous,Music
A Stage IV Musical Biopic,"And the biopic continues to evolve.Stage I biopics simply wanted to involve the viewer in the artist's success. Eg - Buddy Holly Stage II biopics included Stage I but also dragged the viewer into the tragedy of the artist's life. Eg -- Tina Turner Stage III biopics maintained the theme of telling all but no longer cared whether the music was included ... or not. Eg - Bessie And this is the latest evolution. A biopic that sets its sights so high that -- in order to succeed -- it must not only drag you into the life of the artist but also create some sort of Star Trek time warp, so you the viewer are bi-locating in time while you watch.Very ambitious.Not a perfect film. It has lulls and dead spots and places where you are wondering why you are even watching.But the acting is extraordinary. The agency that represents Cusack bills him as ""the hardest working actor in Hollywood."" Here he almost earns that praise.Giamatti is an actor of such class he could play a loaf of bread.And Banks continues her personal trek to show her skills by playing (almost) a completely different character in each movie, sequentially, that she appears in.

Cartoons in primary colors,"On one level this is an enjoyable, sculpted film, competently acted and directed. On another level it renders Brian Wilson's compelling story as a cartoon, with one dimensional villain, and henchmen, and spotless do nothing wrong heroes, in the angelic only-missing-a-halo Girlfriend and the charmingly whacky Wilson himself. His band of brothers are cut out 60's clichés, Mike love clearly cast in his darker shade and the others in shades of invisible. None of these characters are rendered in any detail beyond what we'd expect in a children's cartoon. And when you notice that it makes the whole film a much lesser event that's hard to take seriously, and that does a disservice to Wilson's story. While I enjoyed the recording and youthful Wilson sections the set ups are just too bombastic to nail home the agenda of Evil shrink, Henchmen, Angelic GF, Simple naive central figure etc. No subtlety, no real shades, just primary colors.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
A mature and compassion insight into one of the greatest young minds in popular music Love & Mercy double lead performances from Dano & Cusack compliment eachother well.,"A mature and compassion insight into one of the greatest young minds in popular music Love & Mercy double lead performances from Dano & Cusack compliment eachother perfectly. Sometimes biopic, sometimes psychological thriller and never devolving into hero worship Pohlad's stylish look into the late years of the beach boys, in particular a deep focus into Pet Sounds, is able to find fresh turf in the often overplayed musical biopic subgenre. Paul Dano brings enough youthful charm and unhinged energy to the role of a young Wilson and his voice really holds up, so much so that smart sound editing enables seemless transitions between his renditions of Beach Boys classics and the studio versions, Cusack stands in contrast with his dazed, vacant approach but the reasons for his performance choices are validated as the narrative develops.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Sensitively done, with a certain charm and care","There's something truly unique about this film. I hadn't seen looked at the reviews and at all of the praise heaped upon the film, so I just assumed it would be this formulaic average Hollywood feature. It's certainly not art-house, but it's certainly something different. There's a certain sense of melancholy and real sadness that permeates the entire film. On the surface it's very optimistic and it certainly starts off that way, but it's trying to reflect on themes that are more complex than what I would have originally guessed. I'm not a huge fan of Paul Dano, but he's just perfect here, and this is John Cusack's best role in quite some time. Elizabeth Banks also radiates such warmth and grace, and she's the emotional anchor in more ways than one.Definitely surprising, a sensitive, gentle, offbeat and humorous, but effectively powerful film that will grab you in more ways than one.",,Anonymous,Music

Love & Mercy,"Love & Mercy, Bill Pohlad's bifurcated biopic of Brian Wilson, takes place in two distinct periods of the former Beach Boy's life, with two actors playing Wilson. Paul Dano plays the younger Wilson of the 1960s, who is struggling emotionally as he tries to create what would become the Pet Sounds album. And John Cusack plays the older Wilson of the 1980s, who was emancipated from bed but unaware of the cruelty and manipulation being inflicted upon him by his doctor, Eugene Landy, who is played by Paul Giamatti.Love & Mercy is a movie that possibly doesn't work on paper, but has been created with genuine affection and boasts two marvellous central performances that help make this story cohesive. It's also to the film's benefit that a non-linear narrative is employed. This allows for touching and poignant connections between time-frames, which helps to create a very real person in Wilson. Dano is quite incredible in his transformation, looking very much like Wilson and occasionally singing, with his voice seamlessly blending into Wilson's own during scenes in the recording studio. Dano has proved himself capable of playing unusual and troubled characters and he delves deep into Wilson's psyche, revealing astonishing depths in a character who can be soft spoken and tender one moment, panic- stricken the next and in the throws of genius soon after. Cusack counterpoints this with a very subtle and introverted performance that's almost like a little boy lost, who finds himself through the love and affection of Elizabeth Banks' Melinda Ledbetter. She's almost akin to an audience surrogate in these parts of the movie, as we see what becomes of Wilson in the 1980s and how tightly his life is controlled by Dr. Landy. Ledbetter meets Wilson by chance when he's buying a car from her showroom, but they form a bond that only strengthens as she sees everything that's wrong in Brian's life. Giamatti is on scenery- chewing form as Landy, veering awfully close to caricature at times, with his character being very one-dimensional and vilified as much as Leadbetter is sanctified.Music, of course, is an integral element within Love & Mercy and it's Brian's searching for a new sound that reminded me somewhat of The Glenn Miller Story and another musical genius striving to find something original and unique. There's also a nice recreation of some Beach Boys stage performances and video clips, along with the use of 16mm stock in some scenes. The scenes in the studio when Pet Sounds is being recorded has genuine authenticity - right down to Hal Blaine and Carol Kaye - whilst there are familiar elements abound, such as the musicians wearing fireman helmets, Brian asking if he could get a horse into the studio, lying in bed, the piano in a sandbox and some obligatory namechecks.What Love & Mercy accomplishes so well is finding a way into the head of Brian Wilson without becoming obscure or indulgent in itself. There is some use of creative license, of course, especially in the later years, but this is a movie that's at once beautiful and wondrous, but frightening and often quite sad. Dano and Cusack are splendid as Wilson, and whilst Ledbetter is whiter-than-white, Elizabeth Banks brings such luminosity to the film that it's impossible to be cynical about this aspect of a movie that sits comfortably alongside Ray, Selena and Walk the Line as one of the best musical biopics of the past twenty years, or more.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Good, but not perfect","Overall, I like the film. It does, unfortunately, have a great number of flat spots, minutes when there's no action or dialogue, which I finally took to fast-forwarding through.The film does a good job of showing us the deep problems of Brian Wilson, and also his indisputable genius. I now appreciate ""Good Vibrations"" more than ever, and I've always liked it.Side note: Paul Giamatti, a superb character actor, does an excellent job as Eugene Landy, the vile subhuman who had taken over Wilson's life.

Heroes & Villains,"One of the top films of 2015. Love & Mercy is a tour-de-force of acting and visual craft. As erratic, unexpected and joyous as the noisy mind of Brian Wilson. Rarely, has a biopic been made that accurately depicts the wresting demons of an artist quite like this one. Many try, and fail. This one has a bevy of material to work with, and doesn't waste a drop. Paul Dano, once again, gives a performance that will leave you speechless. It astounds me how vastly overlooked he is an an actor. His work in Little Miss Sunshine and There Will Be Blood should've garnered him two Oscar nominations by now. John Cusack gives another Oscar worthy performance as the older Brian Wilson. This is essential two stories in one. The rocky rise of Brian Wilson, and the love story of his later years. Each connect due to the two people in his life that keep him from living; his abusive father and his abusive, leaching, Hollywood psychotherapist, played incredibly by Paul Giamatti.

A Troubling Trip Inside 1960s Musical Genius,"This biography of Brian Wilson, the troubled genius at the heart of the 1960s musical group The Beach Boys, is an effectively stylized portrait in which Paul Dano and John Cusack share the lead role at different times in his life. They mesh beautifully as the story moves from the recording of the group's seminal Pet Sounds pop album to a few decades later when, with the help of his second wife, Melinda Ledbetter (played by Elizabeth Banks), Wilson emerges from his shell into some semblance of normality. The fine character actor Paul Giamatti is chilling as psychologist Eugene Landy, who holds Wilson hostage emotionally. (PG-13, 2:00).",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Paul Dano Soars, Elizabeth Banks Shines, John Cusack Stinks UP The Joint!","I've been listening to the Beach Boys for forty years, and I've read most of the books written about the band. LOVE & MERCY is a movie I'd dreamed of seeing for years, but it just didn't live up to my expectations.Paul Dano is superb as the young Brian Wilson, a pure soul in a dirty, greedy world who just wants to make music. The half of the film where he makes the album Pet Sounds, and the song ""Good Vibrations,"" is certainly worth watching. But there's nothing said that isn't self evident. Brian is a genius. Mike is a selfish jerk. Dennis and Carl are dweebs. Father Murray is a monster. All these characters are about an inch deep. The movie doesn't have the conflicts needed for drama, because it's already clear who the hero (or victim) is, and what's going to happen. The only thing that saves the Sixties scenes is the purity and simplicity of Paul Dano's performance. He owns Brian Wilson and makes every scene soar, in and out of the recording studio.Unfortunately, in the Eighties section the older Brian Wilson is played by John Cusack. Cusack is wretchedly miscast and utterly at a loss with playing a character who was shy and fragile as a young man, and who is now practically paralyzed by drugs and mental disability. Cusack is often an effective actor, when he plays aggressive, strong-willed, Irish-American Midwestern bully-boy types, but he doesn't convey vulnerable, timid, or fragile emotions very well. His high speed chatter and ever-so-humble mumbling comes across as more of a creepy put on than a heartbreaking tragedy.The problem is aggravated by the fact that Elizabeth Banks effortlessly outshines him in every scene, combining spunk, glamour, sex appeal, and enormous heart in a completely believable character. There is zero sexual chemistry between these two characters. She's completely authentic while he's mannered, artificial, and grating.But beyond the poor performance of Cusack, LOVE & MERCY is sunk by its own ignorance of Brian Wilson's music. Mean old Murray sneers that ""God Only Knows"" sounds like a suicide note. So where is the Murray who ""cried like a baby"" (in Dennis Wilson's words) the first time he heard ""Caroline, No?"" I don't know about Murray, but something tells me the film makers never listened to ""The Lonely Sea"" on the SURFING USA album. Or ""The Warmth of the Sun"" on SHUT DOWN VOL. 2 Do your homework, people! The film makers don't care who Brian Wilson really was. They don't care that he was depressed from the beginning, even during his ""fun"" period.They just want an icon, in the most literal sense, an inanimate object or symbol for purity and victimization.It's also painfully clear that all the Dr. Landy scenes are told strictly from second wife Melinda's point of view. The ""rescue"" scenes come across as unintentionally funny (or unintentionally creepy) precisely because the storytelling is so one-sided. Melinda's desire to get control of Brian is so obvious that she ends up looking just as callous and hypocritical as Dr. Landy. Elizabeth Banks is just brilliant enough to make you put up with it, but after the movie is over you feel like you've been had.This is a very pretentious film, with a lot of ""artistic"" white noise meant to suggest the madness in Brian Wilson's head. There are also some bedroom shots where he sees his past and future self which are clearly a tribute to Stanley Kubrick's 2001. Yet oddly, as I watched the movie I kept thinking of another Kubrick film, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. Because the way Brian Wilson keeps getting batted back and forth between Melinda and Dr. Landy really reminded me of Alex being ""captured"" by the state and then ""rescued"" by the radical conspirators. Except that when Kubrick told the story, he explored the ambiguities, and made the irony dark and chilling. LOVE & MERCY just sort of hopes you won't notice!",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Love & Mercy gives Brian Wilson the dramatic weight and artistic buoyancy his life story deserves.,"I've been waiting a long time for this. I first heard about Love & Mercy when I visited the studio lot of Sunset Gower two summers ago and passed Paul Dano between stages. Part me being too shy and me trying to be professional, I didn't want to disturb him, but nevertheless he seemed too lost in thought to be distracted. And thus, his Brian Wilson, brilliant, tormented, is also constantly lost in the thoughts of his innovative sounds. I've always been fascinated with the life story of Wilson, the album war The Beach Boys had with The Beatles (the band is mentioned but never shown here), and the tragic end with SMiLE. Familiarization with the story certainly helps settle into it, anyone who's not interested in Wilson in the first place may find it quite trivial given their successes, though they half-expected to be flash-in-the-pan rather than influential giants.The appeal of Love & Mercy is the same appeal of their music, it contrasts the light and the dark of the human condition. The film delivers what the fans want right away and the session sequences of the instrumentals of Pet Sounds within the film's first twenty minutes are absolute bliss. But the film is not a run-of-the-mill biopic that checks the obligational list like a greatest hits montage. Instead it mixes styles, timelines, reality, and hallucinations feeling personal, honest and expressionistic, built from the ground up rather than tracing tested blueprints. Director Bill Pohlad is one of the best producers of the past 10 years, sharing producing credits on Brokeback Mountain, Into The Wild, The Tree of Life and 12 Years A Slave. Love & Mercy is his first major film in 25 years, his first feature fading into obscurity, and that passion he has for this project is palpable.You may wonder why he didn't hire perhaps a more confident visionary director to do the job. Instead we got a nice middle ground where it's not too overblown or too subtle to feel timid. The film's photography in particular is quite rough around the edges in certain sequences, for instance the documentary style scenes of the Boys recording vocals feel sloppy, but it immediately makes up for it in the shinier 80s scenes. However, it's not a film that spends much money on being cinematic, the cash evidently went to complete a wonderful soundtrack, but instead it's focused on feeling intimate. It has a great patience that revels in the moment, such as 360 degree shots as Wilson works out God Only Knows on the piano and the cellos on Good Vibrations.The film may feel free-form, but Oren Moverman's script has diligent beat-by-beat structure, something improved from the far too freestyle Bob Dylan bio I'm Not There, and he brings his art of designing conflict that he perfected on the Oscar-nominated script The Messenger, which still feels underrated. It's unfortunate that the three antagonistic forces don't feel as well acted as the trio of protagonists. The actors playing Mike Love and Brian Wilson's father don't have the conviction of Paul Dano. Paul Giamatti's Eugene Levy is overcooked, far too self-aware of his sour motivations, but ignoring the one dimension, he's magnetic as always.The heart of the film is Elizabeth Banks' Melinda Ledbetter. She's rarely had the chance to shine in a dramatic role like this, but bouncing off John Cusack's 80s Brian she provides a nuanced tenderness that takes skill to come off as sincere. Cusack runs the risk of feeling too odd and child-like, we have to simply trust that this is an accurate portrayal, but when faced with the biggest obstacles his performance is well-measured and his emotional highpoints robs Banks of being the best actor in the show. It's still career best worthy for the both of them though and nothing competes with the wonderful chemistry of 80s Brian playing a small ditty for Melinda then letting it flutter into our memory banks.Dano can also be distracting and hard to take seriously as the icon, but he's an actor who knows how to do a breakdown and that's where he undoubtedly shines if not while he's behind the mic. He's terrific in the composing scenes too as it effortlessly flows from his fingers or while he gives relentless notes to musicians. It's a film about the preciousness of the world's most creative minds with the good and the bad that they attract. Jarring at first, it hits an ideal ending with its use of Wouldn't It Be Nice. Now we finally see Wilson older and in love. Bittersweet payoff for 50 years of waiting. Love & Mercy gives the Brian Wilson story the dramatic weight and artistic buoyancy on screen that he deserves.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A refreshingly different type of biopic,"This film tells the story of a woman who falls in love with a very famous but mentally disturbed songwriter, Brian Wilson. A doctor is by his side twenty four seven, restricting and controlling every aspect of his life. She tries to make sense of the whole situation, and does the best she can to make the relationship work.It is refreshing that the film is not a biopic of the band's music career, but mostly concentrates on Wilson's later life when he is on a very tight leash imposed by his doctor. This makes the film way more interesting than the regular musician biopic. John Cusack has lots of screen time, with the camera focusing on him more than Elizabeth Banks. However, I think it's Elizabeth Banks who is the star of this film. I think she's a very good actress, and she continues to shine in ""Love & Mercy"". She shows all the appropriate emotions and she's pivotal in the satisfying ending. Her character is full of love and mercy, sometimes I can't help but think she stays in the relationship out of pity - but that's portrayed not to be the case. I found the film gripping and very interesting. It shows that celebrity's life isn't all sunshine as people think. I enjoyed it a lot.",,Anonymous,Music
A fascinating look into the life of Brian Wilson with incredible performances.,"'Love and Mercy' is a Biopic that doesn't really focus of the 'Beach Boys' and their music, rather it is a very personal story that explores the life of Brian Wilson from some of the highest points in his life right down to some of the lowest. I knew nothing about the Beach Boys or Brian Wilson except for their biggest hits but man i can't deny that i am really interested to find out more about Brian. This film really goes to places i never thought it would upon hearing about it, it does have its fun light- hearted moments but the majority of this film is really about the personal struggles of Brian Wilson and how he had to overcome these obstacles in his life. The film has an interesting structure, rather than focusing on a specific time in his life and showing how he changed progressively, the film follows a younger Brian played by Paul Dano and a post Beach Boys Brian played by John Cusack. This odd structure of highlighting these two times in his life concurrently throughout the film allowed the writers and director to get creative with the way they represented Brian in both times and how they ultimately depicted his transition without showing what happens in between.On a personal level, and in terms of the way they represented and depicted Brian in these two stages of his life and connected them this film was incredible. But from a storytelling perspective, it was a little off. The two times were shown in a way that made them feel like a series of events in Brian's life rather than a flowing story. The way it switched back and forth with all the jumps in time worked to show off Brian's story and quickly develop his character but as a cohesive start to finish story, especially with the younger Brian, it didn't work as well as i would have liked. As the film progressed, this structure of swapping between the older and younger Brian worked more and more but initially for the first 20 minutes it felt a little choppy and hard to get used to. If i go back now after having more experience with that structure it may work better, but just a minor thing.Oh, the performances in this film were just unbelievable. From Paul Dano and John Cusack playing different versions of Brian, to Elizabeth Banks as Melinda and Paul Giamatti as Eugene Landy they were all incredible, powerful and amazing performances. One of the more fascinating things was how Paul Dano and John Cusack managed to somehow play what are essentially these two different characters in a way that you still saw elements of Brian's younger self in his older self and vice versa. It really was great to see, but seriously already, when is Paul Dano going to get some Oscar recognition? This guy is a fantastic versatile actor, from Prisoners to this he really is shaping up to be an incredible dramatic actor and i only improving over time. Elizabeth Banks also puts in a very very emotionally driven performance and in her limited screen time still made her presence felt. But what may have been the most powerful performance in the film was Paul Giamatti as Eugene Landy. I don't know how this guy does it, he literally transforms into this character and where at first you go 'Hey, thats Paul Giamatti'', by the end of the film you completely forgot it was even him. You can draw many parallels between his character in this film and his role in 'Straight Outta Compton' and that is a really good thing as both performances are ones to remember from this year.Don't worry, even though the main focus on the film is almost exclusively on Brian Williams, you do get to see some of the behind the scenes of making some of the Beach Boys' biggest hits. Their music accompanies the film so well and they really did have a song that fit the tone of the film at all moments throughout. So in the end, if you are a fan of Brian Williams and the Beach Boys and you know the story i am sure you will get a good kick out of the film.

"Great Characters and Acting, an Interesting Story, but a Little Slow","Love & Mercy follows Brian Wilson, a member of the Beach Boys band in the past, when he struggles with being in a band and develops mental illness, and in the future when poor caretakers and his illness affects his new-found love life.The plot is one that I think many people would be interested in. I myself never listened to the Beach Boys, but I know lot's of people did. With a story like this I think it would interest a lot of people. Fortunately, I like stories about mentally ill people, so this movie still caught my attention. The way the story is presented is really great, with it switching back and forth between two different time periods. It doesn't ever show too little of one time period, and both are very interesting.The characters are pretty great. John Cusack especially does a great job as Brian Wilson, but Paul Dano is equally, if not more, fantastic. Everyone else is very good in their roles, but these two in particular stood out. The characters themselves are interesting too, and they feel pretty real for the most part.My only real complaint about this movie is that it could be a little slow. Maybe that's because I watched it late at night, or maybe not. Either way, it didn't always hold my complete attention.Overall Love & Mercy is fantastic. The cast is great, the characters are great, it's presented in an interesting way and is just an interesting story in general. It suffers from being a little slow, but otherwise it's a fantastic movie. In the end I would certainly recommend this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Today's Brian more interesting than yesterday's,"I was much more engrossed by the performance by John Cusack, playing the aging rock star, anxious and terribly needy. Unfortunately for Brian, he was needy for the attentions of a charlatan who mulcted him for millions. It was pathetic to see him trying to establish a relationship with a woman under the basilisk stare of a quack doctor. Cusack, Banks and Giamatti are all superb in these scenes. I found myself responding less to the young Brian, played with some commitment by Paul Dano, a visionary with a vision that was going nowhere. Jimi Hendrix made a crushing remark about the conversion of the Beach Boys to the avant-garde: they sound like a psychedelic barbershop quartet.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Pop History,"You don't have to be a Beach Boys fan to love this film. In fact this film is about that one special Beach Boy whose name is Brian Wilson, who is perfectly impersonated by two actors. One for the young Brian who was a studio workaholic, a sound perfectionist, the genius who masterminded those unmatched melodies. The other Brian Wilson is a lost person under total control, who fights the daemons of the past. But there is a glimpse of hope for the later, as he gets to meet a very kind woman who quickly understands Brians worries and supports him in her best way. The permanent switch between past and present of Brians's life makes this film even more interesting and catches the curiosity of the spectator. The scenes are of course strengthened by the matching Beach Boys songs.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Another by-the-numbers music biopic,"I've been a fan of The Beach Boys music for a long time, and even though I'm not typically a huge fan of biopics, I expected my love of the music to make Love & Mercy a winner for me. Yet I felt like this wasn't a film that cared about the music as much as the man. We are shown Brian Wilson working on a few of the more complex songs, but the film seems to be more focused on exploring his mental issues and how his experimentation with drugs intensified those problems. This means it falls into a lot of the same tropes as other music biopics. I was also a bit surprised how much they limited the roles of the other band members. There are moments when they give their input and argue with Brian, but it never feels like they are major characters in the film. In fact, we hardly ever see them perform a song, we just see the recording process.That's not to say that I was entirely untouched by Love & Mercy. Paul Dano and John Cusack do a good tag-team as Brian and you can see they worked with each other to get some of the mannerisms down. Paul Giamatti is great as the Svengali who takes control of Brian's life, although I wanted to see more of the in-between time so we could understand how Eugene Landy came into the picture. While the film didn't delve as deep into the history of Beach Boys music as I'd like, it certainly did pay respect to the elaborate lengths that they took to create some of their best songs. I'm a sucker for any of the scenes where Brian is struggling to perfectly manufacture the sound that he hears in his head. I only wish that was more of the film. This is frequently the case with biopics, even when I enjoy them, I start to wonder if perhaps a documentary would deliver more of what I want to see. Love & Mercy isn't bad, but I want the rest of the story.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Love and Mercy: a brilliantly done telling of a lesser known musical evolution.,"So, I watched Love and Mercy when it had its limited release in Chicago . Being brought up on The Beach Boys' music, Pet Sounds especially, I was excited to see how they presented the story.Love and Mercy is Bill Pohlad's film documenting not only the experimental era of the Beach Boys' music, but also the story of lead singer/songwriter Brian Wilson's psychological illness and his time with Dr. Eugene Landy in the late 80s. They're two stories on their own, which each could support a feature length film, but Pohlad and his team perfectly intertwine the two, giving you a fascinating perspective on the growth of experimental rock music in the 60s as well as what the effect of being a superstar in the past can do when you fall out of the spotlight.Wilson falls to drinking in the 60s, and eventually into depression, and the movie shows that build-up in the 60s, and then switches to the 80s to show the effect it has. Paul Dano plays Wilson in the 60s, and John Cusack plays Wilson in the 80s, and they both do a spectacular job. They play completely different people, but at the same time are playing the same man.A fact about the production, Dano and Cusack never came into contact until they were nearing the end of production so that their portrayals of Brian would be completely their own.I applaud the amount of detail that went into this film, it's what made it such a great biopic of Brian's life. The cinematography, done by Robert Yeoman, whose other works include films such as The Grand Budapest Hotel, The Royal Tenenbaums, and the new Ghostbusters movie, is spot-on in its depiction of 1965 and 1985, respectively. The subtleties in his decisions really help the film stand out from other music biopics.The soundtrack, composed by Atticus Ross, is a mix of original composed music, isolated Beach Boys instrumental and vocal tracks, as well as recorded dialogue by the cast, and is one of my favorite in recent films as are most of Atticus Ross's efforts. It's used intelligently and he knows when to use it for dramatic effect and when not to.A large portion of the film is shot in the recording studio, and Pohlad and Yeoman were going for a documentary/fly-on-the-wall feel, so they shot all the studio scenes with two hand-held 16mm film cameras so as to fully capture that mood. For example, my favorite shot/scene in the whole movie is in the studio; Brian is focusing on cello players, but to see what the rest of the band is doing, Pohlad and Yeoman do a crazy 360-degree shot that shows the entire studio and what each member is doing. The camera-work is incredible and the actors perfectly hit their marks. It's probably one of my favorite shots in any movie I've seen, especially a modern film.Another crazy detail that went into production was the choice to shoot the studio scenes in the exact same studios as the Beach Boys records were recorded in. They still stood unchanged in Los Angeles, so they shot all the scenes in those studios. Pretty crazy and just shows Pohlad's dedication to the painstaking detail of Brian and the group's story.All the shots in the movie are very well thought through and all have their own purpose. Framed purposefully and carefully, Yeoman gets the most out of the screen with the choice of colors he uses, or the way he uses perspective to add depth to what we see. This could be the use of mirrors like I mentioned, or being able to visually and subconsciously separate the difference between the shots in the 60s and the shots in the 80s. And finally, Pohlad's direction is spot-on. Dano, Cusack, and all the rest of the cast are all acting at full form, and part of that is thanks to Pohlad's direction. The entire movie flows continuously and there really is no part that feels draggish or boring. For a movie just over two hours, once the movie starts, it picks up very quickly. It does not take very long to become acquainted with the characters and story.You really don't have to know everything or really anything about the Beach Boys to enjoy this movie. The performances are all extremely convincing, some disturbing, and is a great period biopic. It's not easy to depict two totally different decades, but Love and Mercy does it perfectly. If you're a fan of the Beach Boys, or just want an interesting new movie to watch, Love and Mercy is an amazing film and just about anyone can get something out of it. I highly recommend it. I do not like to normally give this rating but it impressed me enough that I give it a 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Love & Mercy (2014) ***,"Though not many will be able to tell by the title, this is a bio film on Brian Wilson, the genius behind The Beach Boys. The feature is well designed by going back and forth from the ""young Brian"" of the 1960's (Paul Dano) and the ""middle-aged Brian"" of the 1980's (John Cusack). In the '60s we witness 20-something pop star Wilson starting to develop anxiety disorders and mental psychosis, and he has to deal with an overbearing and abusive father ... yet he is still compelled to take the old surfing sounds of the earlier Beach Boys to a higher level. Inspired by The Beatles' RUBBER SOUL album, Brian delves into more experimental territory and spearheads the unusual PET SOUNDS project which is now thought to be one of most classic and influential albums ever made. When jumping into the '80s we encounter Brian as a frail and troubled shell of a man, and under the unscrupulous control of Dr. Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti), who humiliates and dominates him. But Wilson is headed for a road to recovery when he meets Melinda Ledbetter (Elizabeth Banks) who takes an interest in him and sees Dr. Landy for what he really is.A good film overall, this really succeeds due to the effective performances. Though I liked Dano and Cusack as the young and old Brian (even if Cusack doesn't quite look like Wilson), it was Paul Giamatti's turn as the opportunistic ""Dr. Feelgood"" which stood out best. The only flaw I found was that I felt perhaps the movie could have done better in showing us just how talented the young Brian was, and how he was able to accomplish so much. As it appears in the story, Brian is so screwed up that it becomes hard to conceive how this individual managed to achieve what he did. I think we needed more of the ""creative genius"" Wilson in addition to the ""troubled"" Wilson. *** out of ****",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Is this the worst casting of all time?,"yes, you might think this is unimaginative but John Cusack? Movies are a visual art for goodness sake and studios often go to great lengths to find someone who bears a striking resemblance to the person they're playing, especially if that person is still alive so if a lead actor looks nothing like the historical figure he's playing, it's likely to be a major drawback. In this case, for me it was a fatal flaw. I wanted to give it away after 20 minutes or so, endured it until 1'05 and then gave up. What a shame for a potentially riveting movie. What a shame for Paul Dano's great work. What a catastrophic blunder by the casting crew. Some critics have given the film high marks nonetheless. I suspect many viewers will be equally disbelieving. I can't even begin to imagine what they were thinking.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Great Performances in Entertaining Bio Pic,"Love & Mercy (2014)*** (out of 4)Good and entertaining bio-pic of The Beach Boys' main member Brian Wilson who would write and compose some of the greatest songs ever recorded while at the same time struggling with mental illness.LOVE & MERCY is an incredibly good movie but at the same time it's really impossible to try and really capture Wilson in a two hour running time. The only real flaw with this movie is that it clocks in at just 121 minutes and that's simply not enough time to fully capture the genius of Wilson but for the most part this movie does a very good job at explaining his early life as well as one of the most troubled periods of his life when he was struggling to cope with his mental illness due to a worthless man taking advantage of him.There's no question that the greatest thing this movie offers are the performances by Paul Dano who plays the young Wilson and John Cusack who plays the older version. The movie goes back and forth between the early days and the later conflict and it's amazing to see how well these scenes play off one another and I thought it was easy to see both actors in the role. Dano clearly steals the film as he has to deal with the stuff dealing with The Beach Boys as well as the start of Wilson's mental breakdown. Just watching the actor makes you feel as if you're watching a documentary and seeing something real. Dano's take on God Only Knows is without question the highlight of the picture. As for Cusack, his role shows a much more troubled Wilson and the actor turns in one of the best performances of his career. Both Elizabeth Banks and Paul Giamatti are extremely effective as well.Director Bill Pohlad does a very good job at keeping the two story lines moving and working together. Of course there's also plenty of great music on the soundtrack with various classics from The Beach Boys as well as a solo song from Wilson's latest album. If you're a fan of Brian Wilson then I think you're going to enjoy watching the film and if you're unfamiliar with him then you're going to get a good understanding of what he went through. Again, the film falls short of being great but there's certainly a lot of great stuff here.",,Anonymous,Music
Worthy of Awards,"Love & Mercy has outstanding action, direction, musical score, you name it. Elizabeth Banks conveys a wide range of emotions without saying a word. She has that rare quality to make the viewer actually feel what her character is feeling. While I am not a big John Cusak fan, this is one of his greatest performances as an actor. And Paul Dano is an young actor who again is absolutely excellent. Unfortunately this movie, like Pet Sounds album by the Beach Boys, will not receive the box office success it should. But it is a deeply moving movie with insights into one of the greatest song writers in music and should be nominated for several Academy Awards. Normally I do not gush so favorably in reviews but this is a movie that should not be missed. My only slight criticism is that longer versions of the early Beach Boys music should have been included.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A biopic like no other!,"It's hard to know where to start with this movie. It is a mesmerising voyage through key parts of Brian Wilson's life. It also shows us what a musical genius he is and certainly made me ask myself whether he'd have been capable of producing all the incredible music if he hadn't been afflicted with the psychological problems that have affected him to varying degrees throughout his life.The movie cleverly avoids flooding the viewer with wall-to-wall Beach Boys hits, just feeding us snippets of songs as they were being worked on in studio sessions. And, BTW, kudos to Paul Dano for singing some of the tracks himself.Dano and Cusack give stellar performances as the younger and older Brian Wilson, respectively. This is not typical material for Cusack, really, and he carries off the role with aplomb. The supporting cast are also excellent, particularly Paul Giamatti (Does he ever turn in a bad performance? I can't think of any!) and Elizabeth Banks.It's a shame that Love and Mercy didn't get a wider cinema release and I'm sure a lot of people may not even be aware of its existence. But it rally is a superb movie and I encourage everybody to check it out. You won't be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Beached Boy,"(Rating: ☆☆ ½ out of 4)This film is mildly recommended.In brief: With all its fits and starts, Love &Mercy rarely takes off.GRADE: B-Any biopic has the distinct purpose of showcasing its source and the unfathomable obstacles that made this person so significant in our lives. Most are formulaic, based on some factual information with much conjecture, and sentimental manipulative efforts (a bad childhood, a special talent, the highs and lows of a substantial career, etc.) while some, actually very few, are able to be an honest and moving testament to that human being. Love & Mercy, the story of Brian Wilson on Beach Boy fame, does many things right, but it is still standard storytelling that boast a strong performance from one of its actors playing this tortured musician.￼Yes, one of the actors. There are two actors cast to play Brian Wilson: Paul Dano depicting Brian (Past) as the tortured musical genius and John Cusack is Brian (Future) in his more depressed and sadder mental condition in later years. This idea, of using two physically different people to inhabit one man, may seem a bit daring and creative to many (although the same device was used to ill effect in Bob Dylan's 2007 film biography, I'm Not There, coincidentally written by that same screenwriter, Oren Moverman, with help from Michael Alan Lerner ), but the final result is more foolhardy than inspiring.Director Bill Pohlad is only partly successful with this film. He overdoes the artsy self- conscious camera movement and jumpy editing techniques. It's hard to pinpoint the real problem, if the cause lies squarely with the director, the two actors impersonating one man concept, or a very conventional script that rarely shows any depth of character as it freely bounces from Brian to Brian in full AAHD mode. The moviegoer is never allowed to settle into one storyline, past or future, long enough before thrown into another scene due to the film's time-traveling format. ￼ This casting stunt is jarring. Dano is just fine as the young Wilson. He captures the recklessness and euphoria of a creative artist gaining notoriety and plagued with self-doubt. The actor makes subtle choices to show the madness settling in while his obsessive musical talent pulls him further from reality. Mr. Dano even resembles Wilson which helps, but he never resembles John Cusack, which doesn't. Granted, Cusack has the more difficult role showing a man over-medicated and in a zombie-like existence, dealing with his mental illness and emotional anguish, but he doesn't resemble Dano or Wilson in the least. There is no physical connection, no vocal similarities or mannerisms between the two actors. Cusack never finds the nuance of his character. Some of his scenes work very effectively, most do not, due to the actor's inability to fade into his role. Dano succeeds most effectively.There is also a wonderful supporting performance by Elizabeth Banks as Wilson's love interest which helps the film immensely and an odd one-dimensional one delivered by the usually reliable Paul Giamatti as Wilson's duplicitous manager and caretaker, Dr. Eugene Landy. Perhaps his wig proved too clownish for the actor to focus on his craft. (I know I had trouble focusing.) Also doing credible work are Bill Camp as Wilson's abusive father and Jake Abel as Mike Love.￼The film has enough interesting moments that shine in this bi-polar movie, particularly when Pohlad deftly handles the behind-the-scenes studio sessions of Good Vibrations and Pet Sounds. One wishes there were more attention and screen time paid for these and other musical interludes rather that the short musical snippets and hurried melodrama we are given, not to mention an ending that ties up all its loose ends with title cards explaining the fate of its characters (another example of sloppy writing). Special mention goes out to the sound mixing by Eugene Gearty which truly enhances the film, as does Atticus Ross' musical scoring.￼God Only Knows, with Dano solely playing Wilson, further rewrites, and a more linear structured story, Love & Mercy could have really worked. And Wouldn't That Be Nice.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Uncomfortable to sit through ...,"I saw it three times.How do you pay the salaries of Hollywood A-Listers such as John Cusack, Paul Dano, Elizabeth Banks and Paul Giamatti when your movie only earns ten million dollars at the box office nationally?Why did ""Love and Mercy"" earn so little money? American movie goers don't want to see their illusions about famous people ruined by indies such as this one. They also have read too much about Brian Wilson's mental problems in media reports.If Paul Giamatti doesn't get an Oscar nomination for his part in this film, I will be surprised. The movie doesn't tell you that after Dr. Landy (Giamatti) was fired, Brian Wilson collapsed again, and Dr. Landy had to be re-hired at a salary of almost half-a-million dollars per year. (See Wikipedia.)To my mind, this is a great movie, however uncomfortable to sit through.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
In the Head of a Genius,"I'm trusting that this is an accurate portrayal of a tragic drift into psychosis. Brian Wilson who really is/was the Beach Boys heard voices. Some drove him to his knees; others helped him write some really great music. There's a place where he is asked by his brother if he thinks he is Mozart. Had he been writing in that time period, he may have been another Mozart. Rising out of the repression of his father, Brian never felt good enough. He sought approval from the worst of sources. He also made the boys so successful, with huge amounts of money coming in. But like the true artist, he finally found the sound stale and futureless. As his self esteem waned more and more, he fell under the control of an over bearing, ambitious doctor. This man not only misdiagnosed him, he put him on a regimen of dangerous drugs. During his later years, Brian (now played by John Cusack) meets a beautiful woman at a car dealership. He is buying a car and is immediately attracted to her. They begin a weird relationship as she hangs on to him when he is at his weirdest. He continues to be abused by his doctor and a whole series of events occur. There is an excellent flipping back and forth between the young and old Brian Wilson as we are made privy to what he dealt with because of his gifts. My favorite scenes were in the studio when he would insist on thirty or forty takes to get things just so. Meanwhile, the rest of the gang rolled their eyes and pounded their fists. Having grown up with these guys, this was an eye opener. Well done.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"""I think it's an acquired taste."" .. ""Marriage?"" .. ""Matzah ball soup.""","Brian Wilson, the leader/producer/arranger of the popular 1960s group the Beach Boys, stays behind in the US when his brothers and cousin Mike Love tour Japan in order to write songs and lay down instrumental tracks for their next album, ""Pet Sounds"". His busy, creative life, tinged with bitterness over his tumultuous relationship with his father (whom the band had fired as their manager), is juxtaposed with Wilson's life in the '80s as a shattered man inching his way towards a healthier, more normal existence. Vivid, though exposition-heavy shuffling of episodes in Wilson's life and career, with a fussy, somewhat overblown production design in the '60s scenes (where Wilson is played by the impeccably-cast Paul Dano) counterbalanced by a deceptively bland calm in the '80s (with John Cusack portraying the older Brian as a possible paranoid schizophrenic under the thumb of possessive therapist Dr. Eugene Landry). The screenplay by Oren Moverman and Michael Alan Lerner, ""based on the life of Brian Wilson,"" is well-researched if overwritten; every introduction to somebody new on-screen is followed by needless dialogue covering who they are and what they do. Dano could not be better as the younger Wilson, emulating the musician's budding genius and unassuming ego with an introspective, nice-guy personality (until he's pushed, when he becomes defensive though never arrogant). By contrast, Cusack doesn't fare as well. Whether or not Cusack and director Bill Pohlad were aiming for an impersonation here doesn't matter, as the actor's brand of nervous self-doubts and sad regrets have been well-documented on film, making it difficult to accept him in this role; under different circumstances--say, in a roman à clef--Cusack's performance would be solid, but his casting here (perhaps for box office cache) doesn't quite work. The film is a near-miss, but entertaining on the whole, with terrific recreations of Wilson and LA's the Wrecking Crew making musical magic in the recording studio. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,Music
fame and mental illness,"Brian Wilson was the creative force of the Beach Boys, but during the band's heyday millions didn't know that he suffered from mental illness. Bill Pohlad's ""Love & Mercy"" focuses on Wilson at different stages of his life: his creative period in the mid '60s while the group was working on ""Pet Sounds"", and his creative drought in the '80s. The casting of different people in the roles emphasizes what a different person Wilson had become as a result of his mental illness and medication. Seeing how his dad treated him, it's no wonder that Wilson had mental breakdowns. But, it took a crazy person to put together a masterpiece like ""Pet Sounds"".It's a really good movie. Both Paul Dano and John Cusack put on great performances as the young and middle-aged Wilson, respectively. One can see the tension between the band members, as Brian wants to try something experimental while Mike wants to stick to their early work. I especially liked the depiction of the production of ""Pet Sounds""; we're used to hearing the songs, but we get to see what it looked like to do perform them.I recommend ""Love & Mercy"". Equally as good as Dano and Cusack is Paul Giamatti as Wilson's slimy therapist. But most importantly, the movie delves into the mind of one of the greatest songwriters in history.

One from the peak with Pet Sounds and Good Vibrations. Another from Wilson's life in the 80, dominated or maybe imprisoned by his psychiatrist.The first part is the better one.

Great look inside the mind of a tortured genius,"The story of Brian Wilson, the creative force behind the Beach Boys. Most particularly the movie focuses on the mental issues he had, how these affected his creativity, relationships and life. The story is told from two periods in his life - the mid-60s, when the Beach Boys were at their peak and the late-80s/early-90s when Wilson is under the control of Dr Eugene Landy, whose diagnosis, motives and methods are rather dubious. In this latter period we also meet Melinda Ledbetter, a woman who Brian Wilson has a relationship with and who may be his salvation.Great movie. A good look inside the mind of a tortured genius. We see the amount of creativity and musicality present in Brian Wilson and it is staggering. A musical genius whose genius may well have been his undoing. There's a fine line between genius and madman.The creativity part is largely covered in the 60s part, where Wilson is superbly played by Paul Dano.The 80s/90s part is more about the abuse he suffered at the hands of Dr Landy and also his relationship with Melinda Ledbetter. While John Cusack (in his first decent role, and best performance, in several years) gives a solid performance as Wilson this part is less effective than the 60s part. Not bad, just doesn't have the same momentum and feel as the 60s part, feeling more negative and a bit clumsy. Good work by Elizabeth Banks as Ledbetter though.Overall, a very good representation of two crucial points in Brian Wilson's life. Good have been even better if the movie had concentrated on one of the two, as it feels a bit diluted in its current form.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Good vibrations,"I like biographies told as a movie. It always gives a little more to a story when you know it really happened. I am not a fan of The Beach Boys at all even though I recognize all their songs when I hear them somewhere, like most people do I guess. So it was interesting to watch a movie about The Beach Boys and in particularly Brian Wilson. I had absolutely no clue about his personality because like I said I never really followed this band. But I certainly did enjoy Love & Mercy. All characters are beautifully played by their respective actors. John Cusack is really good in his role playing the psychotic Brian. The younger Brian played by Paul Dano is also a joy to watch. Same for Elizabeth Banks playing Melinda Ledbetter as the girl that falls for Brian and that tries to get him out of the hands of Dr. Eugene Landy. Dr. Eugene Landy played by Paul Giamatti is a character you feel intense hate for from the beginning till the end and Paul Giamatti plays that character very well. The movie might be long but in fact it seemed over before I knew it. It's very entertaining and pleasant to watch. I'm glad I saw Love and Mercy and that now I know more about the story of The Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.

"An informative and provocative biography type picture of music legend Brian Wilson and his struggles with life, love, and work.","Finally got around to watching ""Love and Mercy"" and I must say that it was well done a biography picture that tells a lot about a legend. I know ""the Beach Boys"" were before my time yet I grew to like their music as it played while I was growing up. This film tells the story of singer and songwriter Brian Wilson so well showing his good and bad parts of life so well. You will find out why he almost left from the music stage and life itself. The picture is told from two different points of view and thru flashback form as Paul Dano plays the young coming of age Wilson mostly thru the 1960's and we get to see a grown up and still depressed Wilson in the 1980's as an adult played by John Cusack.Thru out the film it is moved along just fine by the music of ""The Beach Boys"", still this picture is a showcase of a man who has lost control almost with his battle against bi polar disorder and hearing voices as along with mood swings it all almost destroys Wilson. Plus the business battles with the band and agents is highlighted and Brian's fight with his therapist is a battle as this is all just backdrop stuff before Brian returns to his life of music. All of this is made better and good when Brian finds peace by falling in love with Melinda(the beautiful Elizabeth Banks).This film shows how one can grow thru struggle and dealing with tough times like that of facing a mental disorder and the battle of business involving people and money always brushes the surface yet in the end thru faith, strength, determination and finding most of all love with a beautiful woman in the end happiness is reached.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Cusack and Dano shine in this unconventional biopic,"An unconventional biopic that is anything but a straight up telling of the Beach Boys rise and subsequent fall from grace, Love and Mercy is an insightful look into the troubled mind of the architect of the band Brian Wilson and a movie that does a great job of providing us with two on song and heartfelt performances.Spanning two different time frames of the early 60's and mid 80's, Love and Mercy sees the always intense Paul Dano portray the younger and musically on fire Wilson while a dishevelled looking John Cusack takes on Wilson at his most vulnerable, a man whose lost himself to his thoughts and worries and most sadly lost the will to produce the music that he seemed born to produce.Both actors deliver outstanding turns with Cusack in particular producing one of his best turns in some time. Both actors seem entirely different in many respects but it's a great way for director Bill Pohlad to showcase the changing mindset of Wilson's persona. A young man bursting with inventive ideas (Dano's scenes in the recording studio are a real blast) to a middle aged man who finds it hard to even get out of bed, its horrific stuff in many ways and with the addition of Paul Giamatti as the evil doctor in Wilson's life Dr. Eugene Landy and the slight yet important turn by Elizabeth Banks as Wilson's love interest Melinda Ledbetter, Love and Mercy found a great cast to act on its material.There's a lot of good in Love and Mercy but also something slightly lacking that would've made it one of the best musical bio's in sometime, problems within similar to the sometimes great but slightly misjudged James Brown film Get on Up. It would've been great to get more musical numbers in to remind us of the Beach Boys live power and at times you get the feeling knowing more about Brian's childhood would've added to our engagement with his later life problems.Love and Mercy will likely be a favourite to all long serving Beach Boy fans and it's nice to see a biopic clear out its own path rather than re-tread a well-worn formula but while Love and Mercy is an interesting and often engaging watch there's something missing and in the end good vibrations can only take this film so far.3 ½ recording studio dogs out of 5",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Love and Mercy, that is what you and your friends need tonight","Knowing little about the Beach Boys music except their well known hits, I did hear about this ""doctor"" who had the lead singer in an isolating grip. Many years Brian Wilson, the lead singer of the popular sixties Beach Boys band, had gone off the rails. Losing it mentally, he was addicted to medicine and was isolated by his ""doctor"" from the outside world. It really is a heartbreaking story. And this movie ""Love and Mercy"" has really made an awesome tribute to the music Brian Wilson made and to the wonderful person he was.""Love and Mercy"" tells 2 stories at the same time. One story about the young Brian Wilson who rose to fame as a musician, and one story about the older, addicted and isolated Brian Wilson, who has gone off the rails. The combination of the 2 stories really mix very fluently. The whole movie is edited in a way a good beach boys song would sound: in total harmony. John Cusack, Paul Dano and Elizabeth Banks all act at the top of their talents.Paul Dano actually seems to sing the songs for real and his resemblance to Brian Wilson is stunning.In the end I am really impressed and in awe of this movie. What a wonderful tribute. Goosebumps all over, because the end is so emotionally uplifting. Special praise for the way the music was remixed, it sounded from another planet so spacious, intense and beautiful. Wow. I would like to add a lot of more comments but in the end it is better to just let yourself get submersed in the music. Dont forget to watch the end credits in which the real Brian Wilson makes an appearance with the song Love and Mercy. ""That is all what you and your friends need tonight..."" as sung by the wonderfully talented Brian Wilson.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A bold effort but doesn't quite work,"It's a partial biopic of two different decades (1960s/1980s) in the life of Beach Boys' founder and songwriter Brian Wilson (Paul Dano/John Cusack). The film jumps back and forth between two eras. One is Wilson's creative period in the 1960s, when Murry Wilson's (Bill Camp) sons, Carl (Brett Davern), Dennis (Kenny Wormald), and Brian, along with their cousin, Mike Love (Jake Abel), are a wildly popular rock band. The 1960s segment focuses on Brian's growing mental health issues, with some hints as to their cause.The 1980s segments pick up after an unportrayed decade when Brian was often unable to function. In the 1980s, Brian is under the 24-hour-a-day care of Dr. Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti). Brian's new girlfriend, Melinda Ledbetter (Elizabeth Banks), contested this control.""Love & Mercy"" is a bold effort but doesn't quite work. Brian Wilson's life was complex enough without inserting unnecessary time flips throughout the film. The 1960s portions work better than the 1980s, which are told from Ledbetter's perspective. Thus, Giamatti almost plays Eugene Landy as a caricature against a Barbie-like Banks, who has a limited emotional range. By the end, you know that Brian Wilson was a superbly gifted musician with little insight into his life.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Sympathetic re imagined biopic of Brian Wilson,"When a movie tries so hard to be sympathetic, that view point can come across as forced. In ""Love & Mercy"" director Brian Pohlad fails to bring the story to a higher level of appreciation due to the sensitive nature of doing a bio on a living legend and asking for our love and mercy for Beach Boy madman Brian Wilson. We bask in Paul Dano's Brian - past, an innocent portrayal of the ""Pet Sounds"" era and then suffer through the later years where John Cusaks Brian - future comes across as straight cliché where the actual history is even darker. Must have been tough to swim in that small vector pool of history, obligation and entertainment. The film works best in the music studio showing the relationships, musical commitment and Brian Wilson energy that carried The Beach Boys on his back.For me, that was worth it on those merits, but I'd admit feeling that the later Brian years fell short as did in reality, leaving a bit of a vacuous feeling at the conclusion. I saw Brian perform live with both Paul & John at a benefit in Tysons, Corner, VA for GIVE AN HOUR which was bringing attention to mental disabilities after seeing the movie only months prior and that was a blast!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Good Beach Boys Because of Paul Dano,"It's time to kick off the summer of reviews! And what better way to do so than with Beach Boys? And so we begin with Love & Mercy, with Paul Dano and John Cusack portraying Brian Wilson in his younger and middle years respectively. I have been a fan of Dano ever since I saw his haunting acting in Prisoners, and he has worked his way up in movies such as 12 Years a Slave. And boy does he shine through here. Not only does he look and act the part, he also sounds the part. And when doing a musical biopic, sounding the part is pretty important and impressive.Now I am a casual Beach Boys fan and really didn't look into their career before this film, but there is really a story to behold. The Dano years of the 60s experiments with LSD and all the typical band stuff from that decade, and it shows the complex mindset of the spontaneous and wonderful mind of Brian Wilson. And you get plenty of good vibrations because you get to listen to a lot of great songs.Go forward a couple of decades to the slightly eccentric Cusack who buys a car from the beautiful Elizabeth Banks who switches up from her usual comedic roles to be a more serious, ""good"" character without too much depth (she's not the focus, but is a driving force and provides romantic connections). Gradually, as she dates the divorced Wilson, she discovers the manipulative therapist Paul Giamatti who has kept Wilson away from all of his family for a solid 2 years at least.These scenes switch back and forth, and it is a solid dynamic to keep the interest fresh for what might be off-putting to some when they hear ""biopic."" You will be engaged and committed, especially if you're like me and are unfamiliar with Wilson's life, but you will also see some missed potential. At just over 2 hours, not all scenes hit the mark and tiptoe through the area marked fluff. There isn't always the intensity wanted in the Cusack scenes, so the powerful moments are toned down just a bit. But, then again, hearing Paul Giamatti yell ""SLUT!"" over and over can't be all bad.Generally speaking, the Dano scenes are better and what I continued to look forward to in the movie. He does the best acting, and watching his methods to find the perfect melodies while his domestic life has its struggles is engrossing and worth the watch. And again, listening to the formulation of the songs is a big treat.There isn't much to boast about directing, but the incredible performance by Dano and the more suppressed and gloomy Cusack are attention-grabbing enough if for some reason Beach Boys wasn't. Ultimately, you'll come away with new appreciation and curiosity about the band that was briefly even more popular than The Beatles, and that is always a success in the mind of a filmmaker.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
The film gave me Good Vibrations!,"Biopic of music legend Brian Wilson, perhaps best known as the main song composer and central artist of The Beach Boys. The film switches back and forth between two eras, the 1960s and late 1980s. In the 60s sections during the making of The Beach Boys most famous album, Pet Sounds. A true rival to The Beatles albums of the mid sixties. Wilson (Brian!) is played excellently by actor Paul Dano in these segments.Brian is displaying the first symptoms of psychological illness during this period. The illness prevents Brian from touring with the band and starts the build up of tensions amongst the Wilson family. I call the band a family (which they were) but I also include Brian's dad who is a bully manager.In the 80s segments John Cusack takes over as Wilson. Cusack delivers arguably his best performance certainly that I have seen since agent Vince Larkin in Con Air in 1996. Wilson is now living virtually as a recluse under the close control of Dr Eugene Landy. Landy is played menacingly by Paul Giamatti. Landy is also shown to be a bully controlling Wilson for want of a better word. Brian meets a female companion Melinda who breaks Brian free from Landy's grasp. The film is a biopic with a difference from recent examples like The Theory of Everything and The Imitation Game. The soundtrack is mesmerising with excellent acting from the actors and musicians in the 60s section. The film ends with the obligatory telling of the lead characters story on screen. The best film of 2015 as of July 2015. It certainly gave me Good Vibrations.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A Great Music Biopic Portraying the life of Bryan Wilson,"Saw this movie in the theaters last summer and really enjoyed it. It was definitely intriguing to see the struggles and hard times that Bryan Wilson went through.Each of the actors looked enough like the Beach Boy members to portray them, and they each do a good job. Paul Giamatti is excellent as Wilson's therapist. It is a very accurate portrayal that makes you absolutely despise him.It's also definitely a plus that we got to listen to plenty of Beach Boys tunes throughout the movie. Their music always has put a smile on my face.In conclusion, this is definitely worth checking out, especially if you are a fan of the Beach Boys.RATING: B+",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Flawed,"First of all, having 2 actors play Brian was pointless. John Cusack was miscast. I wanted to see a movie about Brian and his relationship with Dr. Landy , but we only got snippets of that instead of really examining that relationship. Was he schizophrenic or was Landy a greedy sociopath who manipulated him for his own power. We never find out.
And his brothers had little input, or his family. How and why did they allow this man con to take control?
The ending was flat!",6.0,Anonymous,Music
This thing is a masterpiece from start to finish,This movie encapsulates the life of Brian Wilson so well even if the movie is divided in two. I think it gives an amazing behind the scenes look into how the beach boys wrote such amazing music. But I think ideally this movie would've been better if both sides of Brian were played by dano.,10.0,Anonymous,Music
The Warmth of the Sun.,"The story of Brian Wilson's breakdown and eventual creative rebirth when liberated from the control of Eugene Landy is well know. This film put a bit of flesh into that story. It works well but only as a TV movie, it's not a big movie by any stretch of the imagination. What works well is the footage of the band and the session musicians. Carol Kaye in her sunglasses is the highlight of the movie for me. The actors who play the Beach Boys are great too. Love and Mercy the song is beautiful and Brian sounds so fragile. I do follow the Brian is a genius path and if films like this keep his music alive it is doing its job. ( Brian isn't a genius he is a very naughty boy, sorry I couldn't resist) Eugene Landy and Mike Love are particularly unpleasant in the movie, although I think Love as been misrepresented in the Beach Boys story.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Long & Boring,"I really wanted to like this movie because I love Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys. Their music is fantastic and will live forever. Unfortunately, I didn't like this movie and I recommend that people not see it.I will admit that the acting was good, in all parts. The cinematography and costumes were very good, also. It's the story, direction and editing that, in my opinion, are terrible.The constant back and forth in time is hard to follow. It's hard to tell the time line of events.Wilson's mental illness is depicted with long, slow, boring, no action scenes, with discordant sound effects in the background.And it's hard to believe they would try and sell a biopic about a musician and play virtually none of his music. What's the matter? The Beach Boys music wasn't good enough for Pohlad's artistic sentiments? Pohlad's background noise is the ""real"" music? So this movie is just an ego trip of Pohlad, shamed by the great achievement of Wilson compared to his own, and putting up any garbage as better? Pleeeeze!And the 2001 homage at the end? Wasn't this movie too long already. We had to sit through that stupidity?In conclusion, this movie sucked. Go see Mickey Mouse cartoons instead. Will do more for you.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
A Troubled Musical Journey,"The backwards/forwards style and pacing of this movie may put some viewers off but those who stay with it should be enthralled. To date, this is possibly one of the most accessible screen example of telling a story in dual time frames using two different performers. The life of popular musical genius Brian Wilson is quite harrowing - from a manipulative, abusive father to an opportunistic and equally abusive quack ""Dr"" Eugene Landy. Landy stood to gain a large (and unworthy) share of Brian's legacy - and if not for the eventual intervention of various close family and friends would have succeeded in his attempts to drug Wilson to oblivion.The studio session scenes are highly revealing for the way they demonstrate the parallels of genius and mental instability. They also highlight the respect session musicians held for the time they spent working with Wilson. It seems this venue is possibly where Glen Campbell was introduced to Wilson - before being selected to stand in for Brian during a major tour. Performances, direction, photography and music combine to convincingly tell this talented artists troubled journey up to the present. The use of live, present day, concert footage during the end credits round off a compelling movie experience. While it might mean more to Beach Boys/Wilson followers or those who lived through the early years, it offers equal benefits to any follower of modern musical development.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Great films come with great casting.,"I don't give out 8/10 easily as for me, anything above 6 is a good film, 7 is a great film.I've always been interested in The Beach Boys and you only have to look at the cast to get hooked. I actually stumbled across this one this morning on one of the film channels and immediately tuned in.Always been a Cusak fan, and I love Giamatti who plays an awful character awfully well. Then there's Paul Dano who has such a wide ranging of acting and gets better and better the more I see of him. However I must single out Elizabeth Banks for some extra praise. Whilst I've always admired her I've haven't really taken her serious as an actor which is my bad I guess. She was great in this film, faced with the awful dilemma of whether to help out or walk away, you really felt for her character.The best bits however are the awesome scenes behind the making of God Only Knows and Good Vibrations.Great film, solid 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

The disturbing life of the Beach Boy #1,"Very well made drama about interesting and disturbing life story of The Beach Boys' leader and main composer Brian Wilson.

Now and Then,"Titled after his 1988 song, this Brian Wilson biopic depicts two distinct periods in the Beach Boys front man's life: early success in the 1960s and battling psychosis in the 1980s. Events from both timelines overlap each other and in an ambitious move (that recalls 'I'm Not There'), two actors who barely look like each other another play Wilson for the two different time periods, signifying just how different a person he was in the 1980s compared to the 1960s. Well-intentioned as it may be, the technique is a little too distracting to fully work. John Cusack and Golden Globe nominated Paul Dano are both solid as the two Brian Wilsons but their very different appearances only make it all the more jarring when the film switches between them. Some of the switches feel ill-judged too as the film bounces between emotional highs and lows in both time periods. Such issues aside, 'Love & Mercy' is a technically well accomplished movie with nary a boring moment to be had. The sound design - especially accentuated audio from kitchen cutlery in a key scene - is excellent throughout, the detailed recording studio scenes are fascinating and Elizabeth Banks offers a surprisingly multi-layered performance as Wilson's girlfriend in the 1980s storyline. Her silent confrontation with Paul Giamatti towards the end displays more inner strength than words could possibly offer. The film also concludes on a pitch perfect note with the iconic 'Wouldn't It Be Nice' swelling up at just the right moment. By all accounts, the real Brian Wilson was impressed by the film too.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"A quiet, thoughtful portrait of a genius",I loved this movie . The beach boys music was the sound of my childhood and of course Brian Wilson was the driving force. Paul dano s performance is just spellbinding as young Brian starting to unravel from mental illness and John cusack as an older Brian ravaged by I'll health and under the spell of the evil Paul giamatti who is also amazing. A great film.,8.0,Anonymous,Music
Passable biopic but not convinced,"Inclined to agree with most of the other reviews here, that Dano is great as the younger Wilson, Cusack poor (or else just miscast) as the older one. I've never counted myself much of a Beach Boys fan, nevertheless I was interested to learn more about the tortured artist Brian Wilson, and even prepared to believe he was some kind of unrecognised genius. I wasn't persuaded in the end, though what is clear is that he was vastly more creative than his bandmates or siblings, who would cheerfully have kept making bubble gum music forever. He obviously had a lot more to say, but it was never going to work within what was essentially a cheesy medium, surf music. So the movie oscillates between the sublime and the ridiculous - and to that extent is perhaps an accurate portrayal!",6.0,Anonymous,Music
7.5 Wow. Not an easy movie to watch ... but,"This is one of the most difficult movies I have ever watched. Almost turned it off several times, but John Cusack's version of Brian Wilson kept me coming back. Wow.Paul Dano's portrayal of the young Brian Wilson gave me painful insights as to why the Beach Boys music is was complex and wonderful as it is.The rest of the family, I'm not so sure and I won't speculated. As for the so called doctor - karma never misses the mark and that ""man"" has a boat load of karma coming at him for a loooooooooong time.All in all, I am glad I watched the movie all the way through and into the credits. There's a reward!Thank goodness for Melinda Ledbetter.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
By turns innovative and ordinary,"There are probably two sides to this story, but with the seal of the approval of the Wilsons, this is the version we get. Thankfully it has magnificent lead performances (the supporting actors are a pretty weak bunch) that completely carry it and make you massively care. The chemistry between Cusack and Banks is extraordinary, and they really make you believe in their fairytale, with the scene between them at the piano particularly electrifying.Some terrific touches using the audio (as you'd hope and expect from a film about a musician) and the idea of 'hearing voices', mingled with effective use of the original studio recordings. These are compensated for by some fairly banal directorial choices at times, leaving the movie unbalanced, with one or two scenes and quite a few lines that were entirely surplus to requirements. Nevertheless, fully entertaining, particularly if you didn't know the Wilson story.Was he really a 1960s Mozart? Nope not really, but to misquote Paul McCartney, he was part of a pretty darn fine pop group.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Great concept but the storyline didn't flow well. 5/10,"Review: This movie gives an insight into the imaginative mind of Brian Wilson, who made all of the hit songs for the Beach Boys. I did find the initial story quite interesting and his methods of putting together a unique song, we're pure genius but I did find this movie slightly boring in parts. There is a deep emotional undertone, especially when Brian is being controlled by his therapist but I would have liked to have seen the 3 periods of his life, connected to each other. Anyway, the movie kicks off with the Beach Boys enjoying there huge, chart topping success and numerous hits during the 1960s. While the group is on a plane during a tour, the songwriter/singer of the group, Brian Wilson (Paul Dano), has a panic attack and decides not to go on anymore tours. He then promises his fellow members that he is going to create the ultimate album, Pet Sounds and he goes into the studio with accomplished musicians to make a new sound whilst battling against the voices in his head. He also has a troubled relationship with his father, who they sacked as there manager earlier on in there career and he constantly seeks for approval from him, which he doesn't receive. The movie then goes ahead of time, to the 1980s, when Brian Wilson (John Cusack) is shown to be a broken, confused man whose under the pharmacological and legal thrall of his abusive therapist Dr. Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti). He then meets an attractive saleswoman, Melinda Ledbetter (Elizabeth Banks) whilst buying a car and after numerous dates together, she soon realises that Eugene has complete control of his life and that he doesn't let Brian make any decisions about what he can do. She also questions his medication and delves into the legal side of disconnecting the therapists services, which she thinks is causing Brian harm. After finding some compelling evidence, which she uses to take Eugene to court, they have a heated argument at the showroom, were Melinda stands up for herself and shows that she isn't scared of him. The movie then shows how Brian got into such a state, because of the constant voices in his head and his new found drug of choice, LSD. The group also find it hard to understand Brian's musical vision and when his dad sells the rights to there music, it pushes Brian over the edge. It's a touching storyline which does hit some emotional strings but I did find it a bit messy in parts. There isn't much flow to the film, because it goes back and forth in time and it doesn't finish what subject it has started but the acting is top form from Dano and Cusack. I would like to watch a more detailed movie about this musical genius because he certainly had a unique approach to making music, surrounded by the problems in his life. I'm glad to see that he did make a life with Melinda who, more or less, saved his life and the fact that they got married and had kids together, really does prove that everything happens for a reason. As for this movie, I did learn more about Brain Wilson but the script could do with a rewrite. Average!Round-Up: This is the first movie directed by Bill Pohlad who also produced Brokeback Mountain, A Prairie Companion, Fur, Into The Wild, the Runaways, Fair Game, the weird Tree of Life, 12 Years a Slave and Wild. He also produced Time Out of Mind, which is due to come out this year, starring Richard Gere so he's mostly known for producing movies. As he hasn't got that much experience behind the camera, he didn't do a bad job with this film but I personally think that he shouldn't have taken on a project about an iconic musician as his debut. With that aside, it made some money at the box office and he managed to get some decent actors on board so he can only learn from this experience.Budget: N/A Worldwide Gross: $28.6millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their biography/drama/music movies starring Paul Dano, John Cusack, Elizabeth Banks, Paul Giamatti and Jake Abel. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Music
I Can Hear Music,"Love and Mercy has become one of the movies I watch when I need noise when I do something else, and I usually start just watching it all together after a while. Both Paul Dano and John Cusack brought such a variety to the character, really showing a stark difference between the two time periods shown, the 60s and 80s - that shows how the person and character of Brian Wilson changed through only three decades. I think the way they encapsulated his creative struggles and how his creative thoughts were so loud were done really well - I love the audio in this movie specifically. The blackout opening, the distorted songs - especially the dinner table scene, where everything got obnoxiously loud. I also loved the acting in that scene from Paul Dano - he's really able to show some anguish and anger in that moment.The Beach Boys is probably my favorite feel-good band, even though I am young, I just always find some sort of comfort in their music that is decades old by now. I really love how the real Brian Wilson also supervised this movie - that means it can show a real, unearthed truth that people who watch the movie will now witness and understand the Creative´s trials and tribulations. One thing, though I know it's a biopic about Brian himself - I wish there was more focus on his brothers, Dennis and Carl - I wish they had gotten more development and talking parts with Brian - though I know one of them sadly passed away before the eighties time period of this movie, but I just wish there was more show of their bond and how that also shaped how they made the band and tried to move through the things that happened.Despite that, this movie holds both a joy and a deep relatable sadness that I find myself enraptured by. I think it really shows that creative struggle. Though I am quite sad it isn't free on youtube anymore, I suppose it's fair. I'll definitely have to watch it again when I get the urge.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
An Excellent Musical Biopic,"Brian Wilson deserved this movie. This is the kind of quality film that his musical genius demanded. As a fan of one of the greatest bands on all time, I couldn't have asked for a better tribute.Paul Dano and John Cusack are both great as Brian Wilson. I usually don't think Cusack is anything more than ok, and he actually seems like a drug-addled Brian Wilson. But here though, his demeanor and mannerisms fit the role perfectly. He's actually believable as a washed-up musician close to insanity, and he's complimented very much by Paul Dano, who I think was a perfect casting choice for young Brian Wilson. Paul Giamatti plays his usual role as a horrible turd, but here it's most welcomed, as the person he plays is exactly that, and Eugene Landy is as despicable a person as Giamatti portrays him. Elizabeth Banks is a highlight too, and did a great job as Melinda Ledbetter. I appreciated that she wasn't just a detached love interest for Cusack, but they actually showed Ledbetter intervene in Wilson's life.I don't think the film deviated much from the true story, and it was very believable and engaging. Wilson's drug issues and musical inspiration are well-depicted, and the other Beach Boys are well fleshed-out too. The studio scenes were particularly fascinating, and I could've watched way more of that.I can proudly recommend this as one of the best music-related biographical films out there.

Hanging on to his ego,"In the spring of 1966, The Beach Boys scored their first U. K. Top Ten hit single in almost two years with 'Barbara Ann', a jaunty, fun fun fun record, which added the joys of inebriated partying to their already well established Californian oeuvre of sun, surf, girls and hot-rods. The lush, meticulous, mile high harmonies - cool as a Pacific breeze, laying the blueprint for the West Coast sound. In truth, the soul searching introspection of 'In My Room' gave a clearer indication of where Brian Wilson's creative juices would lead the band in the near future.Blown away by The Beatles' filler free tour de force, 'Rubber Soul', Wilson quit touring, headed into the seclusion of the studio and with the virtuoso musicianship of The Wrecking Crew snugly on board proceeded to painstakingly construct his own magnum opus - 'Pet Sounds'. When the other members jetted in from Tokyo to add their vocal parts, Wilson's compositions drew responses ranging from bemused ambivalence, to Mike Love's foul mouthed hostility - waxing lyrical about gold records. This was 1966, the year of 'Revolver', 'Blonde on Blonde' and 'Freak Out'. Wilson was bang on: It was time to move to the next level. The commercial success of 'Good Vibrations' represented a temporary upswing, but it was too late to prevent Wilson from a drug addled lurch towards the ill fated 'Smile' sessions.'Love and Mercy' is an interesting, intriguing and occasionally infuriating game of mirrors, jagging back and forth from the above period (Paul Dano), to Wilson's 80's persona (John Cusack). Fast forwarding two decades finds Wilson a troubled shell of a man, under the control of out of control Dr. Eugene Landy, (superbly played by Paul Giamatti), frequently lambasting him with repulsive, rambling, rat-a-tat rants. It's probable that Landy had aided Wilson to a degree, but his domineering, over medicating treatment was way beyond its sell by date. Despite his obnoxious bluster, threats and histrionics, Melinda Ledbetter's (Elizabeth Banks) calm resilience, inner strength and enduring love ultimately wins the day.Like 'Love's Arthur Lee and 'Pink Floyd's Syd Barrett, Wilson's star shone brilliantly, but all too briefly. All three became major cult figures as rock casualties in later years. Barrett living as a recluse beneath his Mother's Cambridge home. Lee, relentlessly pursued by hacks eager to shed light on the mysterious (non) follow up to 'Forever Changes', whilst Wilson was ballooning to almost 300 lbs and regularly wearing out mattresses. Like Barrett during his Mad Jack and Mad Sue acid daze, he was most damaged by those closest to him, particularly Murry Wilson, his sadistic, bullying father, who beat him and taunted him as a child and continued goading him during adulthood, cynically deriding the inspired 'God Only Knows' and selling the publishing rights to his music, with the heartless rejoinder; ""You've peaked....five years from now, no one's gonna remember you."" Unlike Lee or Barrett (both dead in 2006), Wilson proved to be an unlikely survivor.Embossed with a Hollywood sheen and its clever clever non sequitur narratives, Love and Mercy strives gamely to depict two different but defining periods in Wilson's journey. There are some fascinating revelations, but the movie never becomes fully immersed in either phase before the next 'pillar to post' sequence kicks in. Nonetheless, it creates enough space for us to warm to this gifted, iconic figure, who against all odds emerged from the darkness to find reclamation, love, a still enthusiastic audience and the ability to leave us with a smile.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

The chimera called fame,"The lifestyles that we used to be so jealous of when we were in our youth, have proved on so many occasions to be unhappy , shallow and tortured.It seems that the gift of so called ""genius"" requires that some other aspect of your existence is taken away... like the ability to live a sane and orderly life.Once you become rich and famous your chance of meeting anybody ""normal"" is similarly taken away from you and you become surrounded by charlatans and opportunists.From that point on, you no longer control your own schedule and it's no wonder that so many pop stars, business execs and artists, develop mental illnesses and can no longer cope with the world.""Genius"" is a very narrow talent and doesn't often spill over into dealing with day to day affairs.So it was (and probably still is) with Brian Wilson, truly gifted but equally messed up in the head. He turned out some fabulous songs, my favourite being ""Good Vibrations"" but he turned out just as much garbage.It's only once you've had a few hit songs that you are allowed the indulgence of top quality professional musicians in your recording sessions and these musicians are the ones who were able to put his ideas into sounds.This is the unbroken thread in all success stories, a gifted but troubled individual who gets a break by way of synchronicity.All the right people come together at just the right time.... and then the aforementioned crepuscular charlatans and opportunists move in and wreck the train.A good movie for one with a pop star as the subject, John Cusack is really good as the older Brian, Paul Dano not as good as Brian the younger (but still OK) and of course Giamatti, as the rogue opportunist, is just superb.There's something missing with Elizabeth Banks' performance but it could be that it's hard to sympathise with a character that goes headlong into a relationship knowing that the partner is not much more than a zombie.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Genius,"In 1967, Brian Wilson -- played by Paul Dano -- was at the height of his powers. Pet Sounds had just been released and he's chaotically producing ""Good Vibrations"" -- arguably the best rock song ever produced -- while his family and band members have no idea what he's doing. Fifteen years later, he's played by John Cusack, certified insane, alienated from his family and under the thumb of his abusive psychiatrist, played by Paul Giamatti. He meets Elizabeth Banks, and his life begins to turn around.Genius is not a term to be thrown around. I like to define it as someone who does something that no one has thought of before, or that everyone has thought impossible. And now the world is never the same again. Wilson's ability to grok a complicated piece of music in his head was not unprecedented. But his applying it to pop music, to rock & rock was novel*. But genius is closely aligned to insanity -- the distinction being that the genius is right this time.Does this movie show this struggle? Well, it does, if you know how to read between the lines. As it is, it's a heart-warming story of a second act in an American life, made possible by the love of a good woman. Which is fine, if not brilliant. It's certainly not genius.*Yes, I know.

Bill Pohlad releases the sessions of an icon into a beautiful non-traditional portrait.,"It tells the parallel narrative of Brian Wilson (Dano) in the 60's during the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds era and Wilson (Cusack) in the 1980's with his unconditional state with psychotherapist Eugane Landy (Giamatti). It matches perfectly with the music, Wilson's mental state and his relationship with the band, his father to meeting Melinda (Banks) and his routines with Landy. The cinematography reflexes both eras with the respective cultures. Notably we see the music videos from the iconic discography replicated with Super 16mm which makes it warm and romantic, a contrast to the white and blue of the 80's era. The score by the contemporary respected film composer Atticus Ross also shines.Paul Dano's performance as Brian Wilson is heartbreaking, he brilliantly captured the era and the producer Brian was. The scene with Dano singing God Only Knows is the entire highlight, a simple scene that completely satisfied my feeling to how music feels and the lyrics brings to the table. But it's also great to see John Cusack do decent at the same time, which I declare is one of his best. Banks gives a strong performance as Melinda who sees Wilson and wants him away from the manipulation of Landy who, Giamatti adds a unforgettable frightful unpredictably in his portrayal. Really tells you how Pet Sounds and SMiLE are extremely significant in music history and all because of Brian's state from the 60's. Bringing the strong accuracy of how the recording went on takes a music biopic to a whole new level than ever expected. It achieves to good and warmth of the vibrations and classed as one of the most important music film of modern times. Bill Pohlad releases the sessions of an icon into a beautiful non-traditional portrait. ***** It's in my list of best films of 2015. Which spot? You have to find out after the Oscars.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A sensitive portrait of a musical genius,"Biopics give us the vicarious thrill of experiencing the life of a real-life famous, powerful, talented or inspiring person. Rarely does the experience evoke an overwhelming sense of pity for that individual, but such is the case with ""Love & Mercy,"" the side-by-side telling of two challenging periods in the life of Beach Boys genius Brian Wilson.Bill Pohlad, who has produced a handful of powerful dramas (""Brokeback Mountain,"" ""12 Years A Slave,"" ""The Tree of Life""), steps in front of the camera for the first time in nearly 25 years to tell Wilson's story, and he does so with the utmost sensitivity and a powerful reverence for the history involved.That level of respect starts with the script from Oren Moverman (""The Messenger,"" ""Rampart"") and Michael A. Lerner. Wilson's story bursts with potential for melodrama — this is the guy who allegedly spent two years lying in bed abusing drugs, food and alcohol. Yet the film limits the scope of Wilson's life to these two windows of time and leaves many of the most difficult moments to the imagination, with scant references to these things both visually and in some dialogue.What results is a look at the more tender and fragile moments of Wilson's life yet also some of the most optimistic. In the 1960s time period, we see Wilson played by Paul Dano as he begins to assert his creative role in the Beach Boys and develop the innovative music that would become the esteemed ""Pet Sounds"" album. In the '80s time period, we meet John Cusack's Wilson, a man-child under the care of psychologist Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti), whose relationship to Wilson becomes threatened when Wilson meets and falls for Melinda Ledbetter (Elizabeth Banks).Dano and Cusack absolutely bust their molds with their performances. Dano, who usually plays — frankly — unlikable pricks, captures a complex portrait of Wilson at such a critical juncture in his life. He's going against the grain of the band and of his stern and crusty father and sits on the precipice of one of the greatest musical achievements and nervous breakdown. He is both self-assured and completely rattled and it works.Cusack gets a Wilson on the (slow) rebound. He's making a personal connection with another person after years of self-abuse, yet he's still in the Landy's manipulative clutches. He's half human, really, but Cusack gives him such softness as he slowly comes back in touch with his autonomy. Banks doesn't get much depth as Melinda, but she's a strong and likable character.Music fans might be a little let down that this film doesn't exactly feature a robust Beach Boys soundtrack. Instead, we get little samples of many of the ""Pet Sounds"" hits, enough of a taste to remember the magic of these songs but not so much that they distract from Wilson's story. These songs have positive associations for people, which clashes with Wilson's reality in so many ways.Alternatively, the the way the film realistically depicts the ""Pet Sounds"" recording sessions and gives a glimpse into that creative process through the lens of era- appropriate cameras is something really special that musical minds will really appreciate. There is a true glimpse into the what it's like recording an album and what made Wilson a genius.""Love & Mercy"" could definitely use more compelling drama at times, and its dual timelines stunts the narrative flow and provides a share of challenges for the audience, which must make connections between the two, but the sensitivity and the desire to let the film stand as a portrait of a man rather than craft it into a Hollywood drama creates a really moving, empathetic experience for the viewer.~Steven CThanks for reading!

"Wow,  I was not expecting this at all","My wife and I saw this movie a few weeks ago, and we were looking forward to seeing a fun movie with plenty of great music. But the time frames were very choppy, even skipping between the 2 actors who played Brian Wilson. Back and forth, back and forth. This did not work for me at all.Cusack was pretty good, and Elizabeth Banks is easy on the eyes, as they say.Yes, I know that Brian Wilson had...and probably still has...all sorts of mental and emotional problems. But why not put more fun scenes in this movie to balance out all the stressful scenes. More songs would have improved this movie, for me, quite a bit.",,Anonymous,Music
"It's wishy, it's washy, it's just like the Beachboys","The acting is fairly good all-round it's just that the story line, as the Beachboys themselves, is really winsome.

"An engaging, focused narrative and great performances definitely make Love and Mercy worth a watch.","To all Hollywood directors out there trying to make a biopic of a person's life, this is certainly the way to do it. Bill Pohlad's emotionally engaging biopic of Beach Boys frontman Brian Wilson is extremely effective with great cinematography, wonderful acting by the leads and is heart wrenching well written. Unlike most biopics that tried to cover the entirety of a person's life, Love and Mercy instead keeps its focus on two areas of Brian Wilson's life. First, when the younger Wilson (Paul Dano) is making the iconic Pet Sounds album in the 1960s and dealing with the aftermath of the album's release. Secondly, it deals with an older Wilson's (John Cusack) deteriorating mental state in the 1980s as he attempts to find love with a local car dealer (Elizabeth Banks), whilst also being emotionally abused by his psychiatrist Dr Landy (Paul Giamatti). By doing this, Pohlad creates a more focused narrative that doesn't confuse the audience by trying to cram in too many of Wilson's life into one two-hour movie. The movie also succeeds in the way in which it transitions seamlessly between the two different time periods. Unlike most biopics, it doesn't present the events chronologically. Instead, it goes back and forth between Dano and Cusack's Wilson. However, it never feels like two different movies, as both sections of the film complement each other and add more depth to the scenes that come prior and after. The acting is all around top notch for the film as well. Dano probably gives the best performance of his career, acting like the mad genius that Wilson was. He perfectly depicts the ever worsening mental state of Wilson and it's shameful that he wasn't even nominated for an Oscar. Cusack also gives one of his best performance in years. Whilst he doesn't quite have as much to do as Dano does, he still delivers a quiet and reserved performance that reminds audiences of why people so adored him in the 90s. Elizabeth Banks is also great in her role as the emphatic love interest of Wilson. Arguably, some might dislike the fact that Bank's character does probably have a larger role in these sections than Cusack but she never feels forced in. Wilson is seen primarily through Dano's eyes and Banks is the voice of reason that is trying to bring him back to reality. If I had to criticise any performance in the film, I would be inclined to say Paul Giamatti. Whilst his performance is by no means awful, I did think he occasionally went slightly too over the top in some parts of the film. When compared to the subtle performances by all the other main actors, I felt his performance became occasionally too cartoonish (although Wilson himself said that his performance reminded him of the real Dr Landy, so maybe I'm in the wrong on this one). Love and Mercy is a film that everyone should watch, regardless of whether they're a Beach Boys fan or not. It delivers an interesting perspective into one of the 20th century's greatest musicians but feels more focused and more engaging than some of the music biopics that have preceded it (e.g. Ray, Walk the Line etc). It's a film that deserves a gander and I can't recommend it enough.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Fame and normalcy simply do not go hand in hand.,"Fame and normalcy simply do not go hand in hand. According to biopics on the lives of famous music artists, this goes beyond the ability to live a normal life where you can go out without being recognized and where privacy is a virtual impossibility. Beyond this...many have demons in their lives that haunt them. We see this in movies such as ""Ray"" (2004) (Ray Charles biopic), ""Walk the Line"" (2005) (Johnny Cash biopic) and ""What's Love Got to Do With It"" (1993) (Tina Turner biopic). ""Love & Desire"" shows us that even the happy-go-lucky group The Beach Boys were pretty warped. On the surface the Beach Boys are this surf-pop group with fun summer songs, who guest starred on ""Full House"" (1988) in their later years. Little did we know that they had their fair share of turmoil. Control issues, artistic differences and even paranoid schizophrenia did not escape The Beach Boys. Biopics are tricky as far as movies go because the plot consists of the events of a person's life, so a finite beginning, middle and end is tricky to create. This movie did well in artistically capturing the craziness of the lives of The Beach Boys. One negative note in the cinematography is that certain scenes were shot as if someone was spying on the speakers with very shaky camera. It's a technique I'm seeing more and more in films and I can't stand it. Just keep the camera still! Overall, this movie was an interesting look at The Beach Boys, but a rather typical biopic.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
solemn but inspired,"Two important periods in Beach Boys member Brian Wilson's career are depicted in the 2014 biopic, Love & Mercy: the 1960s recording of the album Pet Sounds, and the 1980s struggle in the midst emotional abuse. 60s Wilson is played by a solemn but inspired Paul Dano and 80s Wilson by a demoralized John Cusack. Director Pohlad transitions back and forth between decades gracefully and the editing is seamless. The several jumps between decades were not distracting, nor were they hard to follow.Cinematography is simple and effective. Award-winning cinematographer Robert Yeoman is a master of simple shots, as evidenced by his work on every live action Wes Anderson film. Director Pohlad, on the other hand, is not as experienced as a director and for the past two decades or so has been producing films such as Brokeback Mountain (2005), Into the Wild (2007), and 12 Years a Slave (2013). In his second film as director (Pohlad directed an unreleased film in the 90s), Brian Wilson's experience recording ultra-successful album Pet Sounds is chronicled, while also showing the aftermath and later life.Dano delivers a beautiful and passionate performance as a young Wilson. I thoroughly enjoyed the acting through the panic attacks, hallucinations, and euphoria. I love that some of the shots mimic photos of the real Brian Wilson in the recording studio, right down to the color of their shirts. The opening montage appears to be straight out of the archives with shaky and grainy early film filters applied. It was strange seeing modern day actors through such a lens, because it was so authentic looking.Cusack's grim and honest depiction of middle-aged Wilson is stunning. During this time period, Wilson is struggling to gain his freedom from his abusive psychotherapist, Dr. Eugene Landy, played by Paul Giamatti. A quick Google search on Landy reveals phrases like ""Quack doctor almost destroyed Brian Wilson's career"", ""Still haunted"", and ""ethical violations"".I love this film and how the actors portray desperation, compassion, and inner turmoil so well. Despite the tragedy of abuse, the film is still hopeful and bright. Brian Wilson himself commented on the events saying they were ""very factual"".",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Helps You Understand What Happened - and a Great Film Too!,"I'd just like to say I get why there are some negatives in the casting of John Cusack, looks- wise, but over all his performance was moving to me and he did well with the role given to him. And the directors choices to use two different actors, to use the music in certain ways throughout the movie, at just the right moments, certain camera shots, etc. all added up to what was a very compelling and enjoyable movie for me. I remember years ago hearing bits and pieces about what was going on with Brian Wilson during those later years, and this film helps the casual fan - like me - gain a better understanding of this man/genius. I've also encouraged my teens to watch the movie to understand the influence of the Beach Boys' music, and that music was was not just some bubble-gum fun sounding pop. Paul Dano, as usual - Amazing! One of my fave actors these days.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
This is a really great movie whether you like the Beach Boys or not,"I recently watched this film on an airplane flight. What a touching story. At last there is a movie that credits Brian Wilson for something that few outside the music industry know - that he is a musical genius! The other brothers merely sang the songs which he wrote and composed. Also that, like most geniuses, he suffered from mental illness. Simply put, there is far more to the Beach Boys than the image of the clean cut all American boys. The film peels off the many complicated layers of the Beach Boys and gives us a bird's eye view of the internal strife that occurred in the band in it's latter years. At the end of the day, it is clear that the Beach Boys were not just the quintessential Californian Band but a quintessential American Band.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Great and Dramatic Biopic,"Of course you see haters of this movie and the biopic genre in general. I mean come one look at all the famous music biopics The Doors, Ray, Walk the Line, Im not there, Sid and Nancy. They all have ratings below 8. People are way too picky about these things. This one was especially great in my mind because it was dramatic and had very good acting. Im not a huge fan of the beach boys in general i don't dislike them just not a big fan but I loved this movie. ""its not linear what good art stands for"" ~ Ray Manzareck from the doors. It bounces back and forth between 1960s and 1980s Brian Wilson which both actors killed the role. Very interesting story of a man basically slowly going insane. I recommend this for not only classic rock fans but movie fans this is an excellent biopic. You get to enter the world of one of musics most bright visionaries and see his peak and how he slowly enslaves himself in his own mind through drugs, his past, and his obsession with beating the Beatles.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Better than most music bio-pics,"The film did a terrific job of showing Brian worked in the studio. His interactions with the Wrecking Crew and musical innovation were fascinating and the writer, director and editor did a great job of showing both the technical and emotional aspects of creation in motion.The whole movie was very good but especially strong were:1) The Score - The composers ingeniously mixed studio talkback, Beach Boys music, original score and sound efx to add an emotional core that allowed the director and editor to range freely.2) The Editing - The Editor and Director were able to interweave the two time periods in a way that built suspense and kept forward momentum in the plot. The loose juxtaposition of images created an emotional dissonance that reflected the music and the state of Brian's mind.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Brian Wilson - Tortured Genus,"I just saw ""Love and Mercy"" , and I felt like I was inside the head of Brian Wilson , for a little while. I have to sit down and listen to ""Pet Sounds"" again , and maybe even ""Smile"" again , as these albums are the basis of this movie , an extraordinary journey inside the head , and tortured soul of Brian Wilson. It's hard to explain the creative process , and , being a photographer of sorts , and having been told I have a ""gift"" , I can sort of understand what an artist goes through in creating artistic expressions, for a lack of a better term. ""Pet Sounds"" has been acknowledged as one of the best albums in rock history , and it sill reverberates in a way few albums can. Paul Dano plays Wilson the younger , and John Cusack plays the older, damaged Brian , when he's being handled by Dr. Eugene Landy , the quack , as played by Paul Giamotti. , as a manipulative , nasty self styled ""saver"" of Brian. This movie touched me in a way that movies don't usually touch me. There are some slow periods in the movie , and it's not really a mainstream movie , and it's not told in a mainstream - by the numbers biopic sort of way , but , we've seen enough of those kinds of movies. This is told in a way a person who's gone through problems with mental illness and creativity and issues related to that , and I think creativity and mental illness can go together , as has been proved time , and time again. It's not a perfect movie , and Brian Wilson is probably a complicated , tortured soul , and I've heard he can be very touchy in interviews , and very flaky in concert , but the fact of what he probably went through , and the fact that he's still here is a testament to the soul of a true artist. Go see it!",8.0,Anonymous,Music

If it's at all viable, his life was a total waste and the lifestyle of his brothers was angelic which was not the case. He twas manipulated by almost every person he came in contact with.

Faithful telling of the Brian Wilson story with great performances,"I first discovered the Pet Sounds album sometime in the mid 90's. I don't think any album before or since then has had quite the same effect on me. I have always listened to a lot of music but there was something about this that immediately told you it was an album apart. When it was released in 1966 it marked a massively ambitious departure with its orchestral approach and heartfelt lyricism combined with an introspective tone and undercurrents of despondency running throughout the record. (The departure from the previous Beach Boys template meant that mostly fans were alienated and it was not a commercial success at the time).So with my biased unalloyed devotion declared, what then of Love and Mercy the Brian Wilson biopic? This seems to me to be a very faithful telling of the Brian Wilson story. There is no glaring artistic license taken with any of the salient facts of Wilson's life from what I have previously understood, to which I should say- thankfully.The movies approach is unusual in that the narrative moves back and forth between two different periods of Wilson's life. The first is the period around the mid-sixties leading up to and during the recording of Pet Sounds and then Brian's gradual descent into drug- misuse and mental illness. The second begins in the mid-eighties period at the time that Brian started to emerge from his reclusive state and the malign influence of Dr Eugene Landy his discredited psychotherapist.While this method of telling Wilson's story may not be to everyone's liking I think it works. By concentrating on these two periods the film makers can delve a little deeper into the subject matter than if say they were to attempt to encompass a wider time-span in his life. An example of this (and probably a highpoint for fans) is the extended time accorded in the movie to the process of Pet Sounds coming together in Studio with Brian in complete control of a large cast of seasoned session musicians.The performances all round are superb. Of the main players Paul Dano who plays Brian Past lends a brilliant performance to the part of the obsessive and highly sensitive and gifted perfectionist. It helps as well that he bears a striking resemblance to the younger Brian. John Cusack plays the role of Brian Future and he perfectly embodies the damaged and vulnerable elder Brian. Elizabeth Banks imbues the part of Melinda Ledbetter (later Wilson) with strength and instinctive intelligence. Arguably the performance that eclipses them all is the ever superb Paul Giamatti who is near-demonic in his portrayal of Dr Eugene Landy.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

I must continue...should you decide to trust other reviewers and watch this drivel, keep you finger on the fast forward button, as that really is the only way to get through this bore-fest.Let me start with I really do like the Beach Boys, I like and respect Brian Wilson, he is a music icon and genius and deserves so much better than this crap. His story could be and should be compelling and interesting to music lovers, but this sad so called production does him and his story an huge dis-service. I cannot find any redeeming factors in this movie other than Elizabeth Banks is really a cutie, other than that the acting is over the top, the story is NOT developed, and they really don't even include any Beach Boy music other than short snip-its of their songs just to tease you. That said why watch this? My suggestion....DON'T!!!",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Eye opening movie!,"I have always been a fan of the Beach Boys, although I wasn't even born when their music was rocking the world. So, apart from their songs, I have to admit I knew very little about the life of its band members. This is what I liked about ""Love & Mercy"": it helped me discover the struggles of Brian Wilson, and his natural genius.On the other hand, I find it hard to tell if I liked the movie because of the story or because it is a good movie. It's always difficult when a film is based on true events.What I know though is that I was about to fall asleep when I played it, and within a few minutes, I started feeling the need to stay awake and see it through. How many movies could have done that? Not many.So cheers to Brian Wilson for his unbelievable music, and thanks to Bill Pohlad for making us discover what was behind the man who sent ""Good vibrations"" to the whole world.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Grip Strength,"When the music plays, it actually sounds like a well-held-on-grip over brilliantly organized thoughts. It cannot be stressed enough how brilliant Paul Dano gives life into the sum of all thoughts and input to Brian Wilson's character. He brought out the clear contrast of Brian's complexity against those people around him. It cannot be done of course if not for the scary portrayal of Paul Giamatti of Dr. Eugene Landy and the vulnerability from John Cusack. When Paul Giamatti established his presence, it carried over throughout the film like he was some sort of gravity pulling on both the mind of older Brian (John Cusack) and in extension, the audience's. Even when he wasn't there, the bodyguards surrounding Brian almost didn't have their own individuality but only carriers of Giamatti's dictatorship. I'd also like to give credit to Elizabeth Banks's performance because despite the few lines to deliver for a key character, what they lacked in time and depth was given through her connection to John Cusack's. The two of them had chemistry but more than that, their partnership portrayed stability with each other.The direction, screenplay, and editing was also flawless. The film is presented through the knitted episodes of Brian Wilson's life from his youth to the time of his meeting with Melinda Ledbetter and yet, the flow did not seem interrupted. It's simply amazing how the depth of the chaos, the stretch of the struggle, and the rise to recovery were all covered and tackled in the 2 hours of this film. Smooth was the storytelling and more than convincing was the acting. This movie does not disappoint.For similar movies I recommend I Tonya, Walk the Line, and Dallas Buyers Club.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Not just good vibrations,"I must admit I only went to see this film because I had seen everything else released in the last week (you don't get a lot of choice this time of the year!). I knew little about the Beach Boys but did grow up in the 1960-70s so had heard their pop songs quite a lot. This biographical film is mostly set in 2 eras of Brian Wilson's life , the mid 1960s and late 1980s, in a series of back and forth flashbacks. In the early years Brian Wilson is brilliantly played by Paul Dano (a future Oscar winner for sure) where we see how the Beach Boy's hits were constructed by Wilson and how this genius was troubled with mental health issues and exacerbated by illegal drug use. For music lovers , this is a great insight into how Brian broke new ground in music production to the point of obsessive compulsion for perfection. We don't see anything from the 1970s although they are mentioned occasionally to back up the fact that Brian went to a very bad place mentally. Jump to the late 1980s and Brian (now played by John Cusack) is under the control of Psychotherapist Eugene Landy who is played by Paul Giamatti you might think over the top but apparently Landy really was an excessive abusive control freak milking Brian Wilson of his fortune. Whilst out under supervision Brian meets Melinda Ledbetter very well played by Elizabeth Banks (Hunger Games) and they start a relationship much to the disapproval of Landy. Cusack is at his best for a long while as the troubled Wilson which was nice to see. The songs of the Beach Boys are very much in the background so don't expect wall to wall sounds of summer. This is one of the best biographies of the year and a must see even if you don't know of the Beach Boys, the main character performances are really good with the actors at the top of their game. This film inspired me to read up on the history of this fascinating story of Brian Wilson, which I think is a good measure of biographical movies.

Average!,"Based on the life of musician-songwriter Brian Wilson, co-founder of the Beach Boys, 'Love & Mercy' is strictly an average biopic, that never becomes too arresting to be called a knockout on the legend its based upon.'Love & Mercy' Synopsis: n the 1960s, Beach Boys leader Brian Wilson struggles with emerging psychosis as he attempts to craft his avant-garde pop masterpiece. In the 1980s, he is a broken, confused man under the 24-hour watch of shady therapist Dr. Eugene Landy.'Love & Mercy' suffers from erratic Writing. I liked past & future angle, its not like I didn't. But, the final half-hour, especially, the penultimate moments, lack the fizz. I wasn't emotionally engaged nor was I blown away by drama. At best, Michael Alan Lerner & Oren Moverman's Screenplay works in very limited doses. It needed to be stronger, no two options on that!Bill Pohlad's Direction is alright. Coming right away to the performances, John Cusack & Paul Dano enact Wilson, differently, but engrossingly. Dano enacts the younger version, adding uneasy youthfulness to the part, while Cusack, on the other-hand, enacts a more troubled version of Wilson, but the under-rated actor nails every nuance. Elizabeth Banks as Melinda Ledbetter, is splendid & remains in character throughout. Paul Giamatti as Dr. Eugene Landy, is perfectly menacing as the doctor from hell.On the whole, 'Love & Mercy' could've been better.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
One of the absolute treasures of 2015,"Let's start with some honesty, shall we? I came into this wanting it to be amazing. I think Brian Wilson is one of the few true American musical geniuses, a pop pioneer with an ageless sensibility. I wanted it to be amazing, but had my doubts. Dano and Cusack are odd casting to say the least and the biopic genre has all sorts of pitfalls baked right into its very formulas. Therefore, all the excitement leading into Love & Mercy was tempered by an equal if not greater dose of apprehension (this sort of confused cocktail will be even worse once The End of the Tour drops). Now, the film has been playing for well over a month and here I am just getting around to it.Two hours later and any doubts or apprehension I had has been wiped away. Love & Mercy is the best possible screen version of Wilson's life story that I can imagine, even more than I had hoped for. But, more importantly, it's a remarkably well-made film-- lively, smart, and thoughtful. This is director Pohlad's first major film after making a career bankrolling films for the likes of Terrence Malick and Robert Altman. He distinguishes himself with his directorial work here, offering a series of perfectly judged scenes coalescing into an immensely satisfying portrait.Nearly every gambit pays off. The hopscotch structure of Oren Moverman and Michael Alan Lerner's delicately observed script energizes the film and lend it a harmonic musicality, complete with counterpoint and occasional dissonance.John Cusack does his best work in a long time and Dano does his best work ever put to film. 1980s Wilson is both a quintessential Cusack hero-- a quirky romantic out of place in the world-- but with added layers, a softness and hesitance previously seldom used in his arsenal. What he lacks in immediate resemblance Cusack makes up for with physicality, creating a character by modulating his entire body. You can trace Wilson's arch by only paying attention to Cusack's eyes in each of his scenes. Back in the 1960s, Dano embodies Wilson's overflowing sonic imagination as well as his deep internal demons. I've felt Dano to be out of place in every other movie he's been in, but like Cusack he disappears here, falling into Brian's passionate drive. Together the two create a performance of absolute humanity.Banks is given her meatiest role in a while and Giamatti returns to the screen with typical vigor. Both giving performances that provide complex and unexpected shading to characters whose outlines are familiar, but whose particulars ring true. The same goes for Bill Camp who gives Murray Wilson, the domineering father and erstwhile manager of The Beach Boys, rich psychological dimension with a bare minimum of screen time. His malignant presence lingers over the film just as it did over Brian's life.Yet the sound is the real star here. Whether its the actual music of Wilson and the Beach Boys or the adapted and interweaved score-- AO Scott more accurately termed it a series of sonic collages-- by Atticus Ross, this film uses sound as well as anything this year.The true achievement of Love & Mercy is the way it continually finds cinematic counterparts to the experience of listening to Wilson's best work. In that sense, it is as much a tribute to the act of listening to the artist's music as it is to the creation of that music. Indeed, this is one of the few films to ever make the act of hearing so vividly and gloriously cinematic, particularly when that act consists of a woman hearing a lonely, sad, frightened man's plaintive cries for help and responds with compassion.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Superb Brian Wilon bio-pic hits all the right notes,"""Love & Mercy"" (2014 release; 121 min.) is a bio-pic about the life of Brian Wilson, the legendary Beach Boys singer-songwriter. As the movie opens, we get a clever montage of old footage (painstakingly recreated) of the Beach Boys' early successes. After the opening credits, we skip to the 1980s where an older Brian Wilson (played by John Cusack) meets Melinda Ledbetter (played by Elizabeth Banks) at a Cadillac dealership. She has no idea who he is. We then skip back to the 1960s, where we see the younger Brian (played by Paul Dano), after a panic attack and no longer touring, and blown away by the recent Beatles album ""Revolver"", hatch what would eventually become the ""Pet Sounds"" album. At this point we are maybe 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: any bio-pic of a music legend is going to be a highly subjective interpretation (check the Bob Dylan bio-pic ""I'm Not There"" of a few years ago). In this case, director Bill Pohlad focuses on 2 specific periods of Wilson's life: the mid-60s as Wilson's mind slowly but surely gave in to ""the voices"", and the mid/late-80s, when Wilson was under the legal guardianship of Dr. Eugene Landy (played by Paul Giamatti). Of course I cannot vouch whether things really happened as they are portrayed in the movie, but the movie certainly does feel quite authentic. I had seen the trailer a number of times beforehand, and was worried that the performance of John Cusack, who looks nothing like the real-life Brian Wilson, simply wouldn't work, in particular since Paul Dano as the younger Brian Wilson is so unbelievably on point. I needn't have worried, as Cusack makes you believe. But the best performance in the movie may well be by Elizabeth Banks, whom we most recently say in ""Pitch Perfect 2"", both acting and directing. Here, she plays the loving girlfriend who decides that Landy needs to be stopped. Giamatti has a choice performance as Landy, about as unlikeable a character as you'll ever meet, but perhaps even worse is Wilson's dad Murray (played by Bill Camp), abusing/hitting Brian so badly and so often that Brian is 96% deaf on his right ear. There are quite a few tough and uncomfortable scenes in the movie that only reinforce the feeling that Pohlad didn't just want to do a ""love letter"" movie about Brian Wilson. The key moment for me was when Wilson is playing a piano riff to Mile Love over and over and over again, as he tells Wilson ""I have this song stuck in my head, but I can't get it out"", and it's becoming clearer and clearer that Wilson has become a prisoner of his own mind, and worse. (That piano riff would eventually become ""Good Vibrations, though.) Bottom line: this is an outstanding bio-pic, and any music history buff will want to see this.""Love & Mercy"" opened last weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I finally had a chance to see it this weekend. The early evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay, but just okay. I had been looking forward to this movie, and even though I had high expectations coming into this, they were met, and then some. One of the better music bio-pics I have seen in a long time. If you have a chance to check it out, be it in the theater, or eventually on VOC or DVD/Blu-ray, by all means do so. ""Love & Mercy"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Really fascinating to watch!,"'LOVE & MERCY': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A biopic about iconic singer-songwriter Brian Wilson, of the Beach Boys fame, centering on two different times in his life (in the 60s and 80s). The film stars Paul Dano and John Cusack (as the legendary musician) and it costars Elizabeth Banks, Paul Giamatti, Kenny Wormald and Jake Abel. It was directed by Bill Pohlad, written by Oren Moverman and Michael A. Lerner and it features amazing score music by Atticus Ross. The movie has received nearly unanimous positive reviews (from critics) and Wilson, himself, says the film is ""very factual"". I really enjoyed the movie as well (and I don't usually like biopics).The film begins in the 1960s, when Brian Wilson (Dano) first became a pop music sensation; then it flashes forward, about 20-years, to when Wilson had succumb to a battle with severe mental illness, and was legally bound to the obsessive guidance of a therapist, named Dr. Eugene Landy (Giamatti). The story goes back and forth, as we watch the young Wilson obsess over creating 'the greatest album ever made', and suffer from severe panic attacks. We also watch the older Wilson continue to fight mental illness, and overmedication, as he meets his second wife, a Cadillac saleswoman named Melinda Ledbetter (Banks). Ledbetter became determined to free Wilson, from the sadistic control of Landy.The movie is really fascinating to watch, especially if you're a fan of Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys. Like I said, I've never been a big fan of biopics; but this movie is definitely done in a very unique and highly interesting way. Dano and Cusack are both fantastic, in the lead role (especially Dano), even though they look nothing alike (and Cusack looks nothing like Wilson). Banks and Giamatti are also equally as impressive; especially Banks (who has become one of my favorite actresses recently). Ledbetter is kind of (surprisingly) the hero of the movie. Pohlad's directing is great, and the script is outstanding; although I don't like biopics, I do love movies about mental illness. It's a very impressive film!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wOi4IC8bxg",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Had no idea what I was getting into...and was more than pleasantly surprised,"I don't know much about the Beach Boys. I recognized a lot of the songs in the film, but didn't know who they were by prior to watching it. I only saw this movie because my mom wanted to see it and I said I would take her. So glad that I did. Knowing the nothing that I knew about the Beach Boys I envisioned more of a feel good story about the band. I wasn't prepared for the dark behind the scenes story. I was completely engulfed in this story. This is not only due to the well written script, but the superior acting jobs, particularly of Cusack and Giamatti. I was engaged the entire time which is a rarity for me anymore.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
I'm picking up good vibrations,"It's interesting that Brian Wilson, known for making catchy pop tunes has such darkness surrounding him. I've always known about his tiny, tiny connection to Charles Manson, but never knew about his metal complications.I've herd people complain that the movie has holes in it. I don't know much about the Beach Boys to know what they're talking about. All I can see is that the movie is focus on the dual performance of Paul Dano as a young Brian Wilson, and John Cussack as an older one. Brian is a huge part of the Beach Boys, but this movie seems about the man fighting with his own personal demons, and the people directly evolved with that battle and leaves little room for any thing else.Paul Dano and John Cusack do give a worth mentioning performance, but I was also impressed with the supporting cast of Elisabeth Banks who plays Cusack's love interest and Paul Giamatti who plays the antagonist, A doctor using his position to control Wilson. The Guy who plays Mike Love in the movie was notable too.Kind of ironic but I felt the movie was very psychedelic in it's storytelling, as it went back in forth from young Brian to old Brian. the mood was also helped by the performances of the two leading men. It's been a minute since Cusack has been in something worth wild.Love and Mercy was a good watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Painful,"A film about genius, pain and exploitation which was painful to watch, felt exploitative and was distinctly lacking in genius",5.0,Anonymous,Music
A Must see!,"If you are a fan of Brian Wilson run don't walk to see this movie!!! Bill Pohlad did a magnificent job with Brian's story. John Cusack as Brian nailed his performance as did Paul Dano. This is the best musical biopic I have ever seen. It takes you in to the heart and soul of Brian's music. I wasn't sure if Cusack was going to do Brian justice since everyone was saying he didn't resemble Wilson, but I found him very much resembling Wilson during the late 80's and early 90's. He had his mannerisms down to the tea. I really felt hisrole was a harder role to play since we really didn't see or know that much about Brian during those Landy years. Paul Dano did an amazing job singing and playing the piano. His ability to capture that sweet and innocent time period of Pet Sounds and Smile just blew me away. Elizabeth Banks as Melinda Ledbetter is probably her finest work to date. She needs to do more serious acting since she definitely has the chops. This movie is Oscar worthy for sure.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Cusack and Giamatti are spectacular, but Dano is AMAZING!!!","This is a special movie. It doesn't fit the normal ""feel-good"" drama genre though. This is one of those movies that pulls you in, let's you physically and mentally associate with the characters, fills you with hope, beats you over and over again, drains your emotional resources, and when the closing credits appear, feel something long after the end credits are done rolling. In a word - ""mesmerizing"".If I were to pitch this story to Hollywood, my pitch would be nine words: ""A Beautiful Mind"" meets psychotic Nurse Ratchet in real life. This is the true story of Brian Wilson of the 1960s singing group, ""The Beach Boys"". He was/is the genius behind the majority of the success of this phenomenally-gifted musical group with his focus, experimentation with harmonies and instrumentation, and virtuoso mentality. But he paid a heavy, overwhelming price for dedicating his mind to such beautiful music for all to enjoy. He lost his way in real life and his family in the process... Enter Dr. Eugene Landy. Think Nurse Ratchet from ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" without any rules or ethical boundaries. Landy basically threatened, tortured, drugged and controlled every facet of Brian's life, career, fortune and relationships for at least a decade until someone strong enough and brave enough dared challenge this monster. AND it's a true story. The terror that gentle soul must have felt...The movie itself pulls back the ""sunny"" veil of the All-American Beach Boys phenomenon and basically gives the raw emotion to us in a way very rarely filmed successfully to include the audience in the character's actually pain and suffering. You will leave the movie physically exhausted from the smothering and dangerous world Brian lived through for so long.The acting is first-rate on every level. John Cusack and (especially) Paul Dano play Brian over two separate decades - 20 years apart in Oscar-caliber brilliance on both counts. Paul Giamatti is overwhelming in every scene. Almost off-putting actually. But if research is done on the subject, you will find he was deadly accurate in his portrayal of the megalomaniac Landy. He genuinely scares everyone in his path to follow his totalitarian rule - or expect painful, vindictive banishment for life. Elizabeth Banks is the catalyst ray-of-hope Brian so desperately needs to break the ever-tightening yoke around his neck. The rest of the cast is fabulous. Simply amazing casting all around. Special recognition however belongs with Paul Dano as ""Past - Brian"". This is not a slight on the rest of this splendid cast, but this is one extremely rare time I would truly stand up in a movie theater and give an ovation to one person. He's simply that perfect. Not only did Dano add 30 pounds to play the role, he literally was Brian Wilson. His studio work alone in the film should garner an Oscar nomination. Nothing against the other fine actors in this year's Oscar race, whomever they are, but none will hold a candle to Dano's portrayal. He was breathtaking and heartbreaking all at the same time. It was a performance of a lifetime. Bravo, Mr. Dano. Encore.The only spoiler I will give is what my wife said after the movie ended... She felt depressed. No matter the ending, it was the emotional toll she felt throughout the entire journey. Just... sad. We both have a new appreciation for the Beach Boys, their music and relationships as a family, and the genius that is Brian Wilson. They are icons in the true musical sense and should be treated as such. I'm thankful I watched this movie. It is an instant classic about how music originates not only on the radio, but in the brain and mostly, in the soul of a genius.If you can handle a ""down"" Hollywood movie instead of the plethora of standard ""up"" stories and/or Marvel movies currently in theaters/on video, give this splendid movie a try. It is heartbreaking. It is moving. It is emotionally draining. And it is a 10 out of 10.Oh, one last thing... If you rent/purchase the BluRay, after you watch the feature film, DO NOT MISS the Special Feature: ""A Side/B Side: Portraying the Life of Brian Wilson"". It will break your heart. It will also allow you to see how iconic the real Brian Wilson is and is thought of by all the actors and production company. It is emotional and raw. And very, very special.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Powerful Story; Great Performances,"I've been a Beach Boys fan all of my life, so I was eager to see Love and Mercy's tale of Brian Wilson's musical genius and descent into madness. I found the performances to be spot on. John Cusack, who in my opinion is one of the most underrated and under appreciated actors out there, disappears into the role of the older Brian. Cusack shows restraint in deftly depicting Brian's fear and desperation, as well as his view of life through almost childlike eyes as he succumbs to the control of his psychiatrist. Dano's performance is equally brilliant, displaying Brian's musical genius and his emotional unraveling in a compelling and moving way. Paul Giamatti seems a bit over the top as the controlling psychiatrist, and Elizabeth Banks, in her role as Melinda, is appealing but I felt the role could have been played by any number of actresses.Some have criticized the film because Cusack and Dano do not physically resemble Brian Wilson. I completely disagree with this assessment. Both actors essentially become Wilson, capturing his emotions and mannerisms wonderfully and with the right amount of subtlety. I'm not sure why the film didn't receive much exposure, but it contains Oscar-worthy performances by Cusack and Dano and a story that will move you. If you don't know much about Brian Wilson, the scenes showing his creative process during the glory days of the Beach Boys will blow you away. Wilson's impact on music continues to be profound, and this film will introduce new generations to the genius who already has a secure legacy in music history.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Innovative and Rewarding Biopic,"Give yourself a refreshing jolt of summer and a heartfelt movie tale befitting its title in this Brian Wilson biopic. Possibly, some readers will be so post-Beach Boys that name will be meaningless, but not for the rest of us. Director Bill Pohlad made a couple of interesting casting choices. First, he gave the talented Paul Dano the role of Brian in his 1960s heyday, as his mental stability increasingly wavers. Then, rather than aging Dano for later scenes, John Cusack plays the significantly impaired 1980s Wilson. I went in thinking the two would look nothing alike, and they were even encouraged to develop their portrayals independently, yet, as Variety reviewer Andrew Barker says, ""this disconnect (between the two) works, and Cusack's avoidance of mimicry suggests a man who has lost nearly all lingering ties to the young man he once was."" It turns out to be part of the film's power. Reese Witherspoon lookalike Elizabeth Banks plays Melinda, the woman who finds something to love in the damaged, middle-aged musician. But her efforts are thwarted by his psychotherapist—pill-pushing Dr. Eugene Landy, played to a diabolical T by Paul Giamatti (with hair). Wilson's dad, who shows no redeeming paternal instincts, is played by Bill Camp. It's worth knowing that the real-life Brian Wilson generally agrees with these portrayals. The opening sequence is played on the California beach in super-saturated color, with redder surfboards and bluer ocean than was ever possible. The beautiful closing credits feature the real Brian Wilson singing the 1988 song that gave the film its title. Audio and visual evocations of the 60s, like the movie's poster, are effective without feeling artsy and indulgent. I particularly enjoyed the documentary-style music sessions with members of The Wrecking Crew (who provided practically unknown backup for so many musical groups of the 1960s), as they helped Wilson translate the music in his head into some of the most innovative performances of the era for the album Pet Sounds. ""To capture the artistic process in this way is extraordinary, and in many ways unprecedented,"" said Joe Neumaier in the New York Daily News, with much credit due writers Oren Moverman and Michael A. Lerner. Atticus Ross's mashup of Wilson's music creates a terrific soundtrack. Critics have been quick to praise this movie's avoidance of the trite formulas employed in so many movies about entertainers. I didn't read up on Wilson beforehand, so that the movie could surprise me, and it was authentically tense and totally engaging. Don't jump up when it ends. You'll want to see what happened to several of the principals.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Nonetheless, the acting is fantastic and the non-linear way of telling the story is brilliantly done.Even though there are many dark moments, it is still uplifting to watch a true genius create timeless music that stands the test of time.In short, Brian Wilson's story is a rich and textured as his music.

"You Will Not ""Smile.""","It's like this. I've been a Beach Boys fan since their first record, ""Surfer Girl."" My wife and I saw Brian Wilson in concert at Carnegie Hall a few years ago AND WALKED OUT after 45 minutes. Why? He was as high as a kite and the show was presented for one reason--to sell his awful ""Smile"" album because all of his famous compositions were non-existent. And those songs on ""Smile"" were God awful.The worst of Brian, the best. ""Love and Mercy"" wasn't really about the Beach Boys but rather a device to look into the head of someone who was absolutely crazy, induced and naturally. I must give applause to Paul Dano as the young Brian and John Cusack as the adult but that's it. That movie was two hours of torture. Draggy, boring and lifeless. Even if you are as much of a Wilson fan as I, save your dough. Believe me, in no way will you ""Smile.""",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Love & Mercy knows how to pick up good vibrations and make itself one of the best music bio stories,"The world of music has plenty examples from the classical Beethoven to the rocker Elvis Presley to the modern day Miley Cyrus from suffering from mental disorders while trying to contribute their works of art. People have asked if their work has been affected by their insanity or if their work is their insanity. It's tough to decipher as all have proved to produce tracks that people seem to enjoy and continue to buy, without understanding how much work and talent it takes to be great. What's even more unfair is that if the music is a major hit, then it's hard for them to climb out of their illness.It's kind of a sad look on how the music industry works, but it is what it is. It doesn't help that drugs have played a big part in the change of musical tastes. Just look at the sixties when guys like the Beatles, The Who, The Rolling Stones were experimenting with heroin and LSD to find a different creative spark. When Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is the latest craze, people are going to want more of the same thing. In the case of the Beach Boys, Love & Mercy shows the darker side on an artist trying to create a masterpiece while falling into insanity and trying to get out.In the late sixties, lead singer of the Beach Boys Brian Wilson (played by Paul Dano) retires from concert performing to spend more time in the studio to create an album that takes more of a artistic risk like the Beatles did. The problem is that the majority of the band would rather create more of their bubblegum tunes that their famous for, guaranteeing them more money. Brian proceeds with the Pet Sounds and Smile albums where he starts to dwell into LSD where voices start to debut in his mind.While exploring the beginning of the illness, Love & Mercy occasionally cuts forward to the late 1980's where an older Brian Wilson (played by John Cusack) is a broken version of himself who is managed and under the guardianship of his therapist, Eugene Landy (played by Paul Giamatti). Brian meets with a Cadillac saleswoman Melinda (played by Elizabeth Banks) who loves Brian's look at the world, but hates the way Landy seems to have total control over the singers life and the medication that's being taken.Love & Mercy could have easily been a typical rise and fall story that countless music bio movies have been before. Luckily, what's here instead is a artistically amazing look at one man's genus being taken away by an illness. Some might say that A Beautiful Mind already did this story, but not quite in this fashion. Now there's a doctor that's in control and not to mention that to be a genius in music is different then in mathematics.Both Paul Dano and John Cusack are just amazing playing the duel ages of Brian Wilson. I'm glad they didn't try to use only one star and make then younger or older.Love & Mercy also happens to be an interesting legal story about the malpractice of doctors. Without spoiling anything, we find out that Brian Wilson's career could have gotten an earlier restart had it not been a bad diagnosis.With all this going on, I will say that music still plays an essential role. One of the best scenes shows Brian working with the studio and a full orchestra trying to create Pet Sounds, showing a young genius in his happier times before his sickness. Much of that abstract sound from the Beach Boys fills in as the score of the movie and I would have not wanted any other way.I'll give this ten good vibrations out of ten. Love & Mercy is already one of the best movies of 2015 and may be a potential candidate for the awards season. This is a movie that picks up good vibrations all over the place and places each one that makes this Beach Boy story into a beautiful symphony.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Risk taking filmmaking pays off - thoroughly enjoyed this film,"I'd been looking for a captivating film and luckily I stumbled on Love & Mercy about Beach Boy Brian Wilson's life. The director, Bill Pohlad, took creative risks by casting two actors, (Paul Dano and John Cusack), as Wilson in two different phases of his life - the 1960s and 1980s.I grew up sort of at the end of The Beach Boy era, enjoyed their music, owned a few albums, and saw them in concert. I'm not well enough acquainted with Brian Wilson's personal life to know how realistic this film is or not.What I got from the film was the story of an identified patient with some horribly cruel and unbalanced people around him. The way some human sycophants exploit and dimish the light and talent of those who shine is sickening. Who wouldn't crack under the constant and vicious treatment of father and so-called doctor, being misdiagnosed, drugged on harmful psychiatric drugs, high on hallucinogens, and under everyone's thumb?Paul Giamatti played famed psychologist Dr. Eugene Landy in the creepiest, most effective way. Landy was known for micromanaging his ""clients"" lives round the clock. How hard is it to see who the sick person was? Controlling, maniacal, manipulative, and oppressive... what a phenomenal portrayal by Giamatti!Elizabeth Banks shined as Brian's girlfriend Melinda Ledbetter, who became his second wife. Their love story, as portrayed in the film is affecting and inspiring. I also loved Paul Dano, such an interesting actor, as the younger Brian. Through it all, music was Brian's saving grace. I particularly enjoyed the scenes where the curtains part and the audience gets a peek into the creative process.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Brian Wilson: genius or madman?,"I don't think I've ever seen a biopic quite like LOVE & MERCY before, and I'm still processing what I've seen, to be honest. Focusing on two time periods in Brian Wilson's life, it explores the Beach Boys' heyday in the 1960's (with Paul Dano) and a low period in the 1980's (with John Cusack) during which he meets his second wife, Melinda (Elizabeth Banks), who helps him out of his precarious situation with Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti), a psychologist who is very controlling of his personal life. Unlike GET ON UP, the James Brown biopic from last year that followed a stream-of-consciousness approach to narrative structure, LOVE & MERCY is very linear. The two timelines do kind of fade into one another, but the end goal of Brian Wilson's rehabilitation is always front and center. The best aspect of the film is dual performance by Paul Dano and John Cusack as Brian Wilson. Although they each play him differently, due to the different circumstances in those periods of Brian Wilson's life, they still felt like the same person. Paul Dano gets the showier performance, but John Cusack still does excellent work as the heavily medicated Wilson of the 1980's. And, both of them accurately portray the loneliness and isolation that Wilson must have felt. The supporting cast do just as good, though. Paul Giamatti was suitably slimy as the Eugene Landy, the psychologist who takes advantage of Brian Wilson in his weak state, and Elizabeth Banks was very charming and grounded as Melinda Ledbetter, the woman who finally rescues Brian from the prison that his life became. From a technical standpoint, LOVE & MERCY is very competent, with occasional flashes of brilliance. One particularly memorable shot was a long take around a recording studio as Brian is instructing two cellists on the sound he wants them to make. There were also a couple similar shots in Brian's Malibu home (in the 1980's period). There was also a few sequences where the footage was degraded to look like it was recorded a long time ago, which I thought was creative. Then, there's the music. It's been a long time since I've actually listened to the Beach Boys, but it was refreshing to hear it. The score by Atticus Ross was also quite good, its sparseness capturing, again, the loneliness and isolation in Brian Wilson's head. If there's anything negative I have to say, it's that there are some sporadic pacing issues, but nothing so egregious as to make the film unwatchable. Besides, the ending was rather satisfying anyway. Overall, LOVE & MERCY was a uniquely structured psychological portrait in lieu of the typical biography, and it should be commended for that, in addition to the excellent performances and music. As to whether or not he was a genius or madman, I guess there's a little of both (but mostly genius, in my opinion).",8.0,Anonymous,Music

An excellent film of talent triumphing without super-human powers.,"Love & Mercy Hits the High and the Low Notes of Wilson's LifeLove and Mercy is new film about Brian Wilson's long history with mental illness and how he struggled through it to write, Pet Sounds and other well known works including their best selling, ""Good Vibrations.""His father and his brothers pathologically compete against the music for Brian's attention in his early years. In his later years, Dr. Landry played with slimy precision by Paul Giamatti, takes control of his life, his finances and his music like a parasite.Many of the causes of Wilson's mental illness are shown in the film without excessive analysis. The film only hints at whether being mentally unhinged can lead to great art. I don't know, but what I do know is that it has been part of Brian Wilson's creative process from the start of the Beach Boys.The album Pet Sounds, written almost entirely by Brian Wilson, also has a starring role. The film does well in portraying Wilson's manic, creative composing style. He has command over what is being played, how it is being played, the rhythm, the attack on the notes, everything. His brilliance is confirmed in the film ""The Wrecking Crew."" In that documentary, many of the studio musicians discussed Wilson's command and artistry of the music.Today, Pet Sounds is considered one of the greatest pop albums of all times by a majority of critics. At the time, however, many critics panned the album. In the film, his brothers take this opportunity to chide him for the bad reviews, saying that he had veered too far from the ""Beach Boy's sound."" Co-founder of the band Mike Love is portrayed as a real jerk at this moment and throughout the film, trying to bully Brian into abandoning his new musical direction. Today, the audience knows that Wilson was correct about the album. It is a master work.And by the way, Love wrote most of the tepid, cloying and adolescently simple-minded lyrics for the Beach Boys. His part of the song-writing is the weakest part of their songs.The film starts in the near past with John Cusack playing Wilson as an older man. The film switches further back into the past to show cleverly filmed reenactments of the the Beach Boys on tour with Paul Dano playing the younger Wilson on stage. Dano outshines John Cusack in the beginning of the film. However, as the film continues, the situation Wilson finds himself in as a middle aged man clarifies itself, making Cusack's underplayed acting more powerful and Wilson more sympathetic.Facts about Pet Sounds http://mentalfloss.com/article/59457/15-facts-about-pet-soundsMcCartney's Comments on Pet Sounds http://albumlinernotes.com/Paul_McCartney_Comments.htmlRating: Pay full price.You don't have to be a Beach Boys fan to appreciate the story of an artist who struggles through adversity. Wilson prevails without parades, cheering crowds, or phone calls from the president. He is down to earth and human, not otherworldly. In a film industry that is currently obsessed with superheroes, it's nice to see a film where a talented, regular guy succeeds.Peace, Tex Shelters",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Not just one of the better bio-pics of the last few years, this is one of the better movies as well.","""I've got different stuff inside me and I've got to get it out."" Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys are a international phenomenon. Popular with critics and audiences alike they have everything they ever wanted. When Brian (Dano) begins to try and branch out to a different sound he is met with resistance and slowly descends into madness. Now as an adult Brian (Cusack) has found a new love, but once again meets resistance, this time in trying to cure his mental state. I was looking forward to watching this for awhile. I love music and my favorite type of movie are true stories. I like the Beach Boys but am not a huge fan. That said, this made me want to listen to more of their music, this time with the background of what occurred. Paul Dano does a great job and Cusack is the perfect choice as well. I do think that Paul Giamatti is the one that steals this movie and he is excellent in this as always. The movie itself is very interesting and entertaining. It is set up like the Godfather 2. Two people play the same person, one on the way down and one on the way up. The juxtaposition of the two stories works great in this and even though I was excited about this movie it was still better than I expected. Overall, not just one of the better bio-pics of the last few years, this is one of the better movies as well. I give this an A.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Could have been great had they not cast Cusack,"Good and interesting biopic, particularly the flashback/young Brian Wilson scenes, which looked like postcards come to life. Dano was really good and I thought the film did a decent job showing what its like to have a mental disorder where you're 'hear things' and how this is compounded when you're a musician. I could relate! Theres a scene with Dano on a car utterly engrossed in his own mind that really nailed what it's like to experience that--the expression on his face and the sounds of everything outside of your mind being muffled. Really well done.Praises to Giametti's portrayal of Eugene Lundy. You know an actor nails a villain well when you walk away from the film despising the character AND the actor.So why 5 stars? Cause John Cusack had no business being in this movie. He is completely and utterly miscast because he's a one trick pony when it comes to portraying the wounded, the pathetic, and/or the downtrodden particularly when they're mentally ill. The only character he was ever cast in that aligns with his ability to portray these qualities correctly was when was cast as Craig Schwartz in Being John Malkovich. The minute Cusack showed up I was cringing because I knew he was gonna 'Craig' it.I couldn't stop seeing, hearing, or otherwise experiencing the Craig Schwartz character in Cusack's portrayal of Brian Wilson and it really dragged the film down. It was annoyingly distracting and I wish they would have cast someone else. The film might have been an 8 star for me then.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Nice little deuce coupe of a flick!,"The bio flick ""Love & Mercy"" tells the tale of the professional and personal life of Brian Wilson, one of the key members of the infamous Beach Boys band. OK, so let's do the math here, I do include an enormous amount of puns in my movie reviews, and I am reviewing a movie about a Beach Boys member. So you know what that means, will have ""puns, puns, puns"" til my readers start to run away!!! Anyways, Wilson's challenging dilemma was no laughing matter. He battled schizophrenia throughout most of his adult life. Director Bill Pohlad marveled in presenting a double-sided chronology to Wilson's story; first as a young successful songwriter/producer/member of the Beach Boys who thought that ""wouldn't it be nice"" for the band to transform into a more avant- garde sound which dismayed his Wilson brother bandmates, but most notably his cousin bandmate Mike Love. Paul Dano's performance as the younger Dano was right on key. On the flip side, John Cusack magnificently plays the older Wilson who was already diagnosed with full-fledged schizophrenia and is profoundly controlled by his psychiatrist Dr. Eugene Landy. When the older Wilson meets Melinda Ledbetter, a former model turned car saleswoman, it simply leads to better times for the mentally ailing Wilson; but not without a control fight from Team Landy; let's just say Dr. Landy was a real kokomierda. ""Love & Mercy"" is an excellent piece, but not a perfect film; the screenplay at times was bit disoriented and repetitious. But from the instant, I picked up ""good vibrations"" from the supersonic performances from John Cusack and Paul Dano as the Brians, and ledbeter not forget Elizabeth Banks rousing work as Melinda. ""God only knows"" how people can take so many puns in movie reviews, but ""don't worry baby"" because I'm just about done here. ""Love & Mercy"" is worth riding its cinematic wave; in other words, it's beaching, I mean bitching! ***** Excellent",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Quality biopic about Beach Boys legend Brian Wilson,"Love & Mercy is a biopic of Brian Wilson the creative force behind the Beach Boys. It begins with a montage over the opening credits showing the band at the peak of their popularity playing some of their most famous songs at various gigs and performances. Once the film begins properly it focuses on two different periods simultaneously. The earlier is the period just after the Beach Boys commercial peak when Wilson retreats from touring with the band after a panic attack and instead concentrates fully on work in the recording studio on the way to recording the album Pet Sounds, the single 'Good Vibrations' and the ill-fated album Smile; during this phase his mental health begins to deteriorate. The later period the film focuses on is from the late 80's when Wilson is inactive artistically and under the influence of a manipulative psychotherapist. He meets a Cadillac saleswoman who he begins a relationship with and who helps him emerge from his zombie-like situation.The non-linear approach taken to bringing Wilson's story to the screen is unusual for a music biopic. It works well here though and each side of the story contrasts with the other nicely. Both versions of Wilson are played by two quite dis-similar looking actors, with Paul Dano as the younger man and John Cusack as the older version. At first this is a little distracting but the quality of the individual performances ensure that very soon we are drawn in and fully believes that each is the same man. The later story is also helped by a couple of great performances from Elizabeth Banks as Melinda, Wilson's saviour and Paul Giamatti as Dr. Eugene Landy his antagonist. The latter was a sort of replacement for Wilson's overbearing father from the earlier part of the story. Both these men tried to exert a lot of control over Wilson and had a similar negative effect on him. Melinda by contrast is the light in this tale and was the one person who was most interested in what was best for Wilson and her appearance represents the love story of the film.As a music biopic this one most delivers with the behind the scenes sequences in the recording studio where a few key songs are played out before us. It's here that we witness the recording of both Pet Sounds and 'Good Vibrations', regarded by many as one of the best albums and singles, respectively. We see Wilson become obsessed with the complex recording of both, where he utilised a large group of session musicians to create a full ambitious sound and marginalised the actual band in the process. While 'Good Vibrations' went on to be a big hit, Pet Sounds would sell poorly by Beach Boys standards and this, along with Wilson's increased intake of LSD would hasten the deterioration of his mental well-being.On the whole, this is a nicely original music biopic that is so well rounded and focused on psychological aspects that it will appeal to people who may not even be Beach Boys fans.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"""Love and Mercy""--Mostly Good Vibrations","If you remember the 1960's classic album ""Pet Sounds"" by Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys, there is a good chance you will enjoy the movie ""Love and Mercy"".In an unusual music biopic of Brian Wilson, ""Love and Mercy"" structures his life through two highly acclaimed actors, Paul Dano and John Cusack, playing Brian the younger and middle-aged Brian respectively. In a highly innovative flashback structure in which Paul Dano plays twenty-something Brian Wilson and John Cusack plays his fifty-something 1980's version, we see the backstory of a creative musical genius whose abusive childhood and adult life results in the destructive behavior of his middle-age.

A Supremely Fascinating Film. One of the Very Best Of Its Kind.,"The Beach Boys is one of my very favourite bands ever. I could listen to them all day long. So I was thrilled when I saw a new big-budgeted theatrical film based on its leader was coming out. I was in awe from start to finish with this. This has got to be one of the two or three best music biopics in film history. Even if I wasn't a lifelong fan of the band, my opinion on the film would be the same. I have waited so long to review this because a review needs to do the film justice.""Love & Mercy"" is a psychological character study of Brian Wilson. As a deep character study, we are immersed deep into the mind of the musical genius. Paul Dano plays Brian Wilson during the peak of the band in the mid-1960s. Having had a nervous breakdown and jealous over The Beatles' release at the masterful ""Rubber Soul,"" Brian takes time off touring to focus on making the best album in music history. A departure from traditional Beach Boys tunes, Brian makes what many consider one of the best albums ever recorded: ""Pet Sounds."" Cousin Mike Love hated the album because he knew the departure from their signature sound would result in plummeting sales. Despite critical acclaim, Love was right. Love also persuaded Wilson redo ""Pet Sounds'"" followup (SMiLE) to a more familiar sound.
Seeing the musical and mental process into the making of such greatness is out of this world. We watch in amazement as Paul Dano re-enacts Brian Wilson's essence. We feel horrible when Brian clashes with Mike and gets belittled by his father.In the mid-1980s older Brian (now played by John Cusack) meets car salesperson, Melinda (Elizabeth Banks). This is also the part where we get to know more about Brian's childhood. His father was very physically and emotionally abusive. Since Brian was the oldest of the three brothers, he got it the worst. He tells Melinda that his father beat him so hard that he is now hard of hearing in one ear.Melinda finds out that Brian has been under the spell of crooked psychotherapist, Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti). Despite Giamatti not looking at all like the real Landy, his performance was so dead-on that it genuinely scared the real Brian at the screening. Eugene Landy was a corrupt doctor who kept Brian inside a bubble. Landy got Brian on a ton of different medications that worsened his mental and physical health than what it was before. Melinda is determined to get Brian out from under Landy.Dano and Cusack never met and took totally different approaches to playing Brian. Despite the time gap being twenty years, we still see where one guy ends and another begins. They are both Oscar-worthy. Well, so are Banks and Giamatti. When all the leads deliver Oscar-worthy performances that are spot-on their real counterparts, you know you've got excellence.Most of the best films ever dive deep into the minds of their characters; developing them so well, we feel like we've known them our whole lives. Not only do we get that, our subject happens to be a musical genius that we fall in love with. Seeing him on fire composing will make you say wow.Aside from a deep, personal story of Brian Wilson, this is also a tiny bit of a love letter to surf country. The glistening sunlight and lovely waves are beyond enchanting to look at. It may be one small aspect, but it shouldn't go unnoticed.This extremely well-detailed and shockingly accurate biopic needs to be seen by all, whether you like the Beach Boys or not.4/4 (Four stars aren't enough for this.)",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Bad casting spoils it,"Paul Dano is brilliant as the young Brian Wilson, he captured him so well. The other actors playing various Beach boys were also well cast, but then along came John Cusack playing the older Brian Wilson and it was awful, spoiling an otherwise good movie.
There was no reason Paul Dano could not have continued to play the older Brian, movie makeup has come a long way and it could have really worked. Cusack looks nothing like Brian, not even remotely and every time it cut to him the movie lost all credibility. In fact the first time he appeared I had no idea who he was supposed to be.
When you see Brian Wilson himself singing at the end of the movie, it really drives home how badly cast John Cusack was. It is a shame as this could have been a brilliant biopic, but Ray it isn't.
There were some great scenes of early Beach boys, especially the live stage scenes and the making of the album Pet Sounds, and the song ""Good Vibrations,""
Mike Love, Dennis and Carl Wilson, all seemed reasonably well played if a little underused.
Elizabeth Banks played her part brilliantly and out-acted Cusack.
The actor playing Eugene Landy was also badly miss-cast and the scenes surrounding him showed Brian to be a weak almost childish person, not someone with drug and mental health issues.
The best parts of this movie are the recreation of the Beach boys making and performing their classic hits.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
One Of The Best Bio Flicks I've Ever Seen.,"Love & Mercy is a fantastic movie! Artfully done, great soundtrack (naturally), and some Oscar worthy performances from both Paul Dano and John Cusack. Might be the greatest acting I've seen from Cusack, he and Dano perfectly captured the essence of Brian Wilson. The way the film jumps between Wilson's timeline was seamless and told an honest story about a genius artist struggling with a mental disorder while dealing with the negative relationships with the ones closest to him. Its also a great love story, John Cusack and Elizabeth Banks have great chemistry on screen.

Early parts are good. Then it derrails,"I enjoyed the early Beach Boys parts of the story and I wished they had been longer. Paul Dano made a great job as the young Brian Wilson and those parts of the movie were very good. I also wished there had been more of their early music and the group beginnings and rise to fame, maybe exploring better the conflict relationship with their father. 
The later parts of the story were not of the same level. John Cusak was a poor casting for the role of the older Brian WIlson. There is nothing likable about his character and it was difficult to see what made his future wife get attracted to him, other than his bank account. It is the victors who write the history books, or in this case they are the ones that will sell the rights to the movie and control how some character, including themselves will be depicted. Maybe I am totally wrong about this, I have no way to know, but the important thing is that this is the way the movie made me feel while watching it, that it was a struggle about who would control Brian Wilson fortunes.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

The movie was so 100% about Brian. It doesn't matter the actors portraying rest of the band were not believable either. Paul Giamatti was a cartoonish fool as the villainous doctor.The back and forth shifting of time of Brian Wilson's life masked the ridiculous poorly acted story playing out on the screen. It made it kid of interesting. And, most importantly, it split the time you had to watch the two leads try in vain to be Brian Wilson.
