Spike Lee's Engaging A-Team Heist-Film Scores,"'Inside Man' engages the viewer from the opening scene through the credits. One of the better Heist films one can watch, with an all-star cast of highly-accomplished actors delivering the goods. Recommended viewing!No ordinary film maker, Lee taps his expertise in film making, applying superior cinematography, editing, and direction skills.Headlining the film is Denzel Washington as the good guy cop, and Clive Owen as the highly intelligent robber (with the screen-play thankfully avoiding the crazy/insane cliche' Bond movie villain characterization).""Filling-in"" as good as one will find in bank robber caper films are the superior supporting cast performances of Christopher Plummer (who has never delivered anything sub-par in his career), Jodie Foster (effectively playing against her ""type""), Willem Dafoe (over-due for an Oscar), Chiwetel Ejiofor (perfect subtle side-arm detective partner to Denzel), and across the board good performances by the entire supporting ensemble cast.Lee doesn't try to play out the big surprise ending cliche', but instead allows one to piece things together as the film unfolds, letting us ""in"" to the narrative piece by piece. This is refreshing and elevates the film overall.Really hard to find any critical piece missing in the film. Editing and pacing excellent, and even the potentially preposterous story idea works. Yes there are a few ""identifying the magician's tricks"" moments inside what could have been a perceived as an over the top narrative, but one overlooks those because this is quite the entertaining film and it is put together so well - Witty dialogue delivered by some of the all-time great actors who were perfectly cast on their parts.Bravo to all concernedüëè, and two thumbs up!üëçüëç",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
an entertaining heist flick,"Note: I stay away from describing the plot in any detail because it would be very hard to do so without spoiling elements of it. ""Inside Man"" starts out as a no holds barred, high octane action-thriller, and by its midpoint fully transforms into a breezy, tongue-in-cheek heist movie, reminiscent of The Sting. I felt it to be a little over-plotted, but that comes with the genre - the expected twists and turns are all here, thankfully mostly in non-expected ways. Contrivances abound, and we don't really learn the background of the heist (ie. how the robbers learned about their target) but the story and the overall atmosphere more than make up for this. The meticulously designed plot also compensates for the lack of real 3D characterization - save for Denzel Washington's ambitious policeman hero, who at least achieves a level of humanity throughout the story. The character interaction between him and his sidekick (Chiwetel Ejiofor of ""Serenity"" fame) and the frustrated captain played by Willem Defoe is great with some sparkling dialog. Clive Owen is okay, most of the time convincing as the criminal mastermind, although he spends most of the film wearing a mask. I'd say this film is harmless fun, not your usual Spike Lee fare, which goes to prove his versatility. There is a hint in the back-story at some heavy issues of the past, but it's nothing more than a macguffin that only achieves some slight significance in the resolution of the movie. There is a neat structural trickery in the use of flash-forward scenes, hinting toward the aftermath of the heist without giving away the real ending. It's used sparingly and cleverly. I can highly recommend this movie, it is never boring for a moment, what's more, I was enjoying it so much that as events were progressing toward the climax, I was wishing it would go on. And that's very rare for me in the movies nowadays.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"With Inside Man, Spike Lee has crafted a very original and exciting thriller.","Spike Lee is one of the most consistent directors out there. Save for some more uneven pictures like She Hate Me and Girl 6, Lee's body of work is just plain impressive. And while Inside Man is not up there with Do The Right Thing, Clockers and 25th Hour, it is definitely an entertaining and intelligent thriller that does things a little differently than most cookie cutter thrillers you see in theaters nowadays.A bank robbery in New York has gotten out of control, and it's up to police detective Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) to act as hostage negotiator and get the bank personal and customers out safely before things turn even worse than they already are. This turns out to be a tough case, since the leader of the bank robbers, Dalton Russell (Clive Owen), turns out to be a very smart individual, who has everything planned to perfection, and who throws up surprise after surprise for Frazier and his men. But while the people around Frazier are slowly getting more and more nervous, he himself does not lose his mind, and begins a high stakes battle of wits with Russell. Things are further complicated, however, when the mayor of New York introduces a mysterious woman to Frazier. This woman (Jodie Foster) wants to protect something that is hidden in one of the safety deposit boxes inside the bank, and she will stop at nothing to force Frazier to let her inside the bank and make sure nothing happens to the contents.This all sounds like an intriguing premise for a thriller, but the movie goes a few steps further than just having an interesting plot. Because while Inside Man does hit all the right notes when it comes to keeping you guessing about what is really going on, it is also very successful in mixing the grittier moments with comedy elements. At times, Inside Man is very funny, but in a way that does not deflate the tension. The dialogue is sharp, with the conversations between Frazier and Russell being especially fascinating, and both actors are at the top of their game in this new movie. Washington's Frazier is an intense but laconic individual, who has a permanent smirk on his face but who reads the bank robbers intentions better than anybody else, while Owen is charismatic and fascinating as the mastermind behind the bank robbery. I was a little disappointed however with Jodie Foster's role. While her part is potentially fascinating, she does not really get the chance to do anything with it other than look cool and act tough. Yes, we all know that she is very good at that, but with a bit more background story, and a bit more screen time, her part could have been even more interesting.With Inside Man, Lee showcases an interesting way of directing thrillers. He ignores the usual build up that you see in thrillers, which consists of an introduction, a chronological development of the main intrigue, followed by a final act in which everything is wrapped up neatly (even flashing forward several times, thus revealing some important developments before they have happened), and this only serves to make Inside Man a movie that is more than your regular suspense movie. I enjoyed this original approach very much, even though he does take quite a long time to wrap things up at the end.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Intelligent thrills,"A pleasure from start to finish. An older Denzel Washington has begun to emerge, and his performance here suggests he has many good years left. Clive Owen is terrific as the mastermind. He, and the plot, keeps you guessing. And while there are plenty of clues, they are so well incorporated that very few viewers will see how this one comes together in the end.One major quibble: Jodie Foster's character is more archetype than person so it's to her credit that she pulls it off as well as it does. However, don't let that deter you from enjoying one of the best movies of the year. I'm glad to see Spike Lee tackle another genre film. He brings a re-invigorating approach to what, in other hands, would be a tiresome rehash. That liveliness seems to have worked on him, too -- this is his best film in several years.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
High time the academy gives Spike Lee some respect!,"Whether I was into the subject or not, there's always a filmmaker at work in a Spike Lee film... he's one moviemaker who never loses sight of being a filmmaker first and foremost, and he's absolutely outdone himself with INSIDE MAN, a taut thriller which avoids the colloquialism that alienated mainstream audiences from some of his earlier work.If you've seen the trailer or heard anything about this pic, you have been misled. Everything I heard left me feeling like yeah, OK, I'm going for Denzel. Denzel vs. Clive Owen will be interesting.From the first shots and opening credits, you are submerged in artistic vision, and a finely honed piece of work the likes of which I haven't seen in years. I'd almost give this one a ten.. and I don't hand out tens freely. I do not want to spoil this. You have to walk in cold, and let this film grab you by the short and curlies.This is one film where there isn't a spare frame or wasted cheap shot. Every zinger zings, and there are laughs too, laughs at merciful intervals to break the tension and remind an audience on the edges of its seats that movie-going's supposed to be entertaining, dammit. The cinematography is brilliant, and the music is fantastic - true cinematic score, true genius. I can't praise this one enough.Christopher Plummer is superb, in what is (perhaps coincidentally) an ironic bit of casting. Jodie Foster rises to a challenging persona with aplomb and ease, and my only complaint of the entire exercise is that her character's name 'Madeline White' is perhaps a little clich√©. Beyond that, there isn't a filmmaker alive who brings New York to the screen with anything approximating Spike Lee's vision.It seems there hasn't been a lot of junket for this one, and that Spike Lee's presence has been downplayed... as if the studio downplayed the fact that this is a Spike Lee film slightly, until the word was out that this film is over and beyond what an audience might already expect from one of his films.So... let me just say.. man o man this is a cinematic mind-blowing amazing one and a half hours... it's brilliant, tight, funny, articulate, intense, and high time the academy gives Spike Lee some respect.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Spike Lee puts together A-list cast,"Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) talks about a perfect bank robbery from what looks like a prison cell. Police detective Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington), still in the dog house for something, is given the bank robbery. Detective Bill Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is his partner. There are hostages. The bank president Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer) has something important in a safe deposit box. He brings in fixer Madeleine White (Jodie Foster). Captain John Darius (Willem Dafoe) is the uniform cop in charge of the crime scene. The robbers seem more interested in the storage room than the bank vault or the deposit boxes.Director Spike Lee is making a stylized robbery. It's wall to wall A-list stars. That's actually distracting to have so many stars scattered in one movie. It takes away from any realism that Spike wants to inject into this movie. Also everything Spike does here is pointing to a surprise reveal. There is teasing, but this is over teasing. Everything is a mystery. Wink! Wink! Again it takes away from any realism. The mysteries are compelling for awhile but it gets tiresome.The reveals are the biggest aspects of this movie. It's a shocking reveal and the jolt is quite enjoyable. But the more one thinks about it, the more problematic it gets. I have questions about the investigation. I have questions about the scheme. The cops should have used a re-enactment to place everybody in their spot. There is also video of the customers before the robbery. The investigation should be able to narrow the suspects much better. Then they should have tailed the suspects. I have questions that don't get answered.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Don't miss this awesome movie!!,"This is a movie that you don't want to miss! Wonderful plot and keeps the audience guessing till the last second. Denzel is at his best playing the NYPD detective, his wonderful acting makes this story as believing as it can be. Clive Owen, what a superb actor! He is so clam, smooth, and elegant in this movie and he actually makes me root for the ""bad guy"" from the beginning till the end. Jodie was good, too. However, she doesn't shine as much as the other two actors, but she is still great. If you have seen the preview of this movie than think it might worth checking out, I'm telling you, this is 100 times better than you think! Get up from your chair and go see the movie, NOW!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Well Acted But Not As Clever As It Thinks It Is,"Continuing my plan to watch every movie in Denzel Washington's filmography, I come to his first movie of 2006, Inside ManDenzel says ""You saw 'Dog Day Afternoon.' You're stalling."" The problem with name checking an amazing movie, is it just reminds you, you'd rather be watching that.I remember liking this one, but I found it to be a let down, this time around. I found myself picking fault after fault with the movie. It's routine, cliche and not as clever as it thinks it is.Christopher Plummer, as the bank president, doesn't look in his 90s, which he'd need to be given his role.Clive Owen (Who we see in the first shot of the film, talking about the crime in the past tense, we know he won't be killed) says at the beginning ""I choose my words carefully and I never repeat myself"" but he will say ""two busses and a plane"" several times, including one where he says ""I've already told you"" and he repeats himself to Jodie Foster, too.Who is Jodie Foster's character?? I've just watched the movie and do not know!! She was so smug, and I was dying to see her exposed, but nothing came of it!! Great legs, though!Every police interview is conducted without a single lawyerThe movie is well acted, but with three Oscar winners (Denzel, Jodie Foster and Christopher Plummer) and three Oscar nominees (Willem Defoe, Clive Owen and Chiwetel Ejiofor) it's not surprising. And it does have some good ideas, but a lot of it, is just filler, padding out a bloated runtime, like Denzel's check cashing, coke bust hanging over his head or most of the scene's involving Jodie Foster, the possible outcomes of them storming the bank and all the talk about Big Willie and the twins.I didn't hate the movie, but I remember it being better.Inside Man was the 4th highest grossing movie of Denzel's career (behind Remember The Titans, The Pelican Brief, Crimson Tide) grossing $88 million at the domestic box office and was the 22nd highest grossing movie of 2006. His 5th best performing movie (behind The Pelican Brief, Crimson Tide, Philadelphia and Remember The Titans) at the time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
My kind of movie in this genre.,"In the crime/mystery genre Inside Man is just a bit better than a normal good movie. It's not excellent though, for that the heist is just too far fetched and perfect. Everybody likes to watch the perfect heist but in this case it's a bit exaggerated. But other than that small detail the rest of the movie is suspenseful, or at least it keeps you attentive as you keep wondering what will happen. For that there was the excellent interaction between Denzel Washington and Clive Owen. Both did a great job with their characters. The whole cast was perfect for this story. Spike Lee made another entertaining movie, one that I will watch again in a few years.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Just a Tad Smug!,"This is a decent but not particularly memorable movie. I thought that Denzel Washington was pretty good, but he seems to have settled into a type. Confident and unyielding and always right (Coach Boone from Remember the Titans). This is fine and I enjoy watching him. This movie is about a bank robbery where the perpetrators are after more than money. It has to do with a righteous cause, but what happens is that the possibility of pulling it off and getting what they want is on such fragile ground that you need to ask the question, ""Isn't there an easier way?"" Anyway, the scenes in the bank are quite good but we really need to extend our disbelief at times. I've always wondered about that ""get me a plane and a million dollars"" business anyway. Well, there's a lot more to it than that. See this and enjoy the characters, but in the long run, it's pretty far fetched.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Well made heist flick,"An unusual turn for director Spike Lee, the conventional heist movie 'Inside Man', starring Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Jodie Foster & Chiwetel Ojiofor.Even though the plot has twists, it's still pretty straight forward stuff for the usually controversial filmmaker. What is obvious though, is that good filmmakers turn this material into something more than it might have been by a 'lesser' director.Solid performances by the cast, even though Jodie Foster is somewhat underused in this, but still, a solid heist movie with an interesting turn of events.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A good bank robbery film.,"Inside Man tells the story of a man named Dalton Russel, who leads a daring bank robbery that turns into a hostage situation. Now he's dealing with disgraced hostage negotiator Keith Frazier, who is attempting to get to the bottom of things. When the shady CEO of the bank and a woman he's hired to help him protect certain interests arrive, he begins to discover that there's more to this bank robbery than it would seem. This is the only Spike Lee movie I've ever seen, but trust me, I'll see more, since this was a very intriguing film.What I liked about Inside Man was the style it was made. It is choppy, but not so choppy that it's annoying (cough, Domino, cough, Man on Fire), so you get a sense of tension, and it seems very high paced. The plot is good, and very intriguing. There are some things you have to figure out throughout the film, which makes it more interesting. My only problem was that after the bank robbery was over, the film continued for another half hour, and it started to drag a bit. The dialogue in the movie is very cool. There's some humorous and some awesome lines that come out of the character's mouths.The acting is very good. Denzel Washington is good as always as Det. Keith Frazier. Clive Owen gives a solid performance as Dalton Russell. I liked Willem Dafoe and Christopher Plummer. Jodie Foster wasn't as good as she usually is, but she's not in the movie a whole lot.Overall, the movie lags toward the end, but it's intriguing and has an awesome plot.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Classy Tedium,"Perhaps I'm too intelligent for this film. :) Of course it is well acted - look at the cast, however I found the 'plot twists' derivative and obvious. As a whole it isn't clever enough or meaningful enough to justify its slowness and lack of excitement. It was like attending a lecture by someone who knows his stuff, but on a topic of little interest. Speaking of lecturing - the 'where is my turban' scene was like an clumsily inserted mini-lecture making an out-of-place social comment,
The opening scene is characteristic of the whole - stylistic, but ultimately it proves to be pompous. The plot details are as easy to pick holes in as is, apparently, a safety deposit box lock is to pick with a beginner's lock-pick. This film doesn't deserve to be listed under 'Thrillers'.",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
By not being a straight genre film it manages to strengthen and weaken itself at the same time,"An ordinary day in a major bank, a man dressed as a painter walks in and points torches at the CCTV cameras. Seconds later more people dressed as painters burst in and announce their intentions to all inside. As the hostages are professionally moved into a group and made to dress in the same suits as the robbers, the alarm is raised by a passing cop. For Detective Frazier this is just what he needs to help take his mind off accusations of corruption and girlfriend stress. With a by-the-book hostage situation in front of him things look good but internal and external pressures soon convince him that things are not as straightforward as he first thought.With the trailer offering a great Saturday night, twisty crime thriller, a heavy cast and a strange directorial choice in Lee, this was a film I was hoping would be glossy, slick, silly and fun. However, although I enjoyed it for what it was, I must confess that the lack of consistent direction and pace made it more difficult to get into than I had hoped. It isn't like this at first, with the film jumping right into a very slick taking of the bank and establishing a professional group of thieves to content with. Bringing in Frazier continues this delivery because he has a good swagger to him and it looked like they would pull off this film. You see, things like this need pace and energy and direction ¬ñ like sharks, they need to keep moving forward or they die; they die by letting the audience question things or move back off the edge of their seat to a vantage point of criticism. With things like Phone Booth, we were never allowed to step back and thus it worked; however here it tries to do other things (to its credit) but these produce an irregular pace, inconsistent tone and tend to take away from the central, gripping action without putting in more than they take out.It still works but it steps away from the robbery too often to touch on other areas. Now these areas could have been a great compliment to the main thread but they don't work as well as they should. The external pressures from Madeline White should have increased the tension in the film but instead they were mostly separate ¬ñ interesting still but not complimentary. It doesn't help that many of the twists are obvious (certainly the reason for the robbery was obvious ¬ñ even if it is never actually explained or justified that well) and when the final one does come it is delivered too slowly and reduces its impact. The film is funny and this works quite nicely without slowing things down. The device of the interviews as jumps forward is interesting but unfortunately it tells the audience too much and spoils some of the later action by making it too predictable. Like I said, I still enjoyed it but at times I found myself bothered by the impression that it was a genre movie actively trying not to be a genre movie and only hurting itself in the progress.Visually the film is impressive even if occasionally it felt inappropriate for the material. The movement of the camera, the lush shots of New York, the ""chest-cam"" shots and the use of music are all unmistakably Spike Lee and it looks great for it. At times it is a bit obtrusive and almost feels too grand for the material but it is hard to criticise a great director (which is what I personally think Lee is) for having his own style and feel, even if at times he is a fault for reducing the pace and energy of the material. He shows that, although his personal films are more interesting, he can do a good job as director-for-hire as well. The cast are impressive on paper but the delivery means they are not all that good. Foster is a good example, she is a solid presence but her material is weak and half-done and I personally felt she could have been totally removed from the film without any great detriment. Washington is cool in the lead and gives a lively genre performance. The film suggests that he thought he was doing more than just a genre film and there are bits of his character that don't work ¬ñ his eclectic wardrobe is one but his past and his girlfriend are also threads that don't work that well. Owen is lucky enough to have the best material and despite a so-so accent he does convince and drives the film forward. His motivations and background are annoying question marks but this is not his fault ¬ñ it is the fault of the delivery that let me question things rather than rushing forward at full speed. Ejiofor is good and works well despite having little to work with. Dafoe is a nice addition but I did feel his material could have been done by someone less famous just as well as he did. Plummer starts the film with such an air of a ""powerful old man with sinister secret"" that you never doubt for second where the film is taking him ¬ñ again not all his fault but he is not used at all well.Despite all my misgivings, the film did do enough to engage me and entertain me on a Saturday night as I suspect it will many viewers. However in the cold light of day the film does have threads that don't work and problems relating to pacing and inconsistency in tone. Funnily enough it is actually the irregular pace that reveals the problems whereas it is had played itself as a straight genre film then it would have covered these with pace and energy. Worth seeing but by not being a straight genre film it manages to be both stronger and weaker at the same time.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Inside Man,"Great job by Washington, as usual, and an overall average film. Not nearly as huge of a let-down as Lucky Number Slevin, but Inside Man was not all that intriguing itself. It has huge build-ups and some really suspenseful moments, but the ending leaves you feeling a little cheated.By all means, see the movie and judge for yourself - It just didn't deliver what I expected from it. I am most definitely not bashing the plot; you will be on the edge of your seat until the ending begins to be revealed. At that point you may feel like shrugging your shoulders and muttering ""eh..."". Washington does a great job of portraying his role, but you may feel a little resentful of his character's extremely bold/holier-than-thou attitude halfway through.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Excellent and absorbing,"""Inside Man"" is a wonderful Spike Lee film starring Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Willem Dafoe, Jodie Foster and Christopher Plummer. It's about a bank robbery planned by Owen that turns out to be something very clever and very different. Washington plays a police detective under investigation for missing money who, knowing he's innocent, wants to prove himself and get to detective first grade. He and his partner investigate this bank robbery, which has 50 hostages, all who have been given outfits and masks so that they're dressed like the robbers. Therefore, it's impossible to tell who the robbers are. It's also increasingly difficult, as Washington attempts to negotiate with them, to tell what it is they're after. When Foster, a high-level negotiator hired by the bank owner (Plummer) enters the scene, Washington knows something much bigger than money is involved.Really excellent movie with twists and turns combined with humor and some really scary scenes. My only complaint is that Clive Owen is a bad choice to play someone who spends most of the movie in a mask. It's too frustrating to have someone that good-looking covered up.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Would have been better if it wasn't so 'clever'...,"It's all too obvious that Inside Man is meant to be a lot more clever than it actually is; director Spike Lee peppers his film with a light sprinkling of comments on race and society, but not many of them hold any weight and by the time the film ends, it's difficult to work out just what Lee is actually trying to say. Films that try to be intelligent and fail usually receive low ratings from me, but this one manages to claw some points back because it is entertaining, and the central bank robbery plot line is intricately handled with care and panache. It's a shame that Lee decided to try and make more of this than was necessary. I realise that a great deal of undemanding bank robbery films have already been made; but this one could have been one of the best if the director had stuck to the strongpoints. The plot has two sides to it as we follow a bank robbery from inside the bank and out. Dalton is a smart bank robber who figures out a way to both rob a bank and bamboozle the police at the same time. Denzel Washington is the cop on the case, while the plot is given a third dimension from a scheming power broker.One of the principle problems with this film is that too much is made of it, and the plot sometimes doesn't come together very well as Lee analyses his plot from both a past and present perspective. This means that we have the police interviewing suspects at the same time as the robbery is going on, and this usually involves cutting back to the bank and seeing someone doing something memorable, before Denzel Washington and his partner try to crack the people they think could be responsible. It gets a bit repetitive too often, but there's usually just about enough going on to make the film interesting. The acting is good, with the wooden Clive Owen getting a role that suits him as the masked bank robber; while the charismatic Denzel Washington provides more interest as the copper. Willem Dafoe doesn't make much of an impression, however, and Jodie Foster could have been better used. Scenes such as the one that sees a kid talking to Clive Owen about a video game involving some rapper are painful and unnecessary, however. The heist plot is well worked out, though, and seeing the plan come together at the end is the film's biggest highlight. Overall, I can't say I didn't enjoy this film as its entertaining and well worked; but it's not the great film that the director obviously wanted it to be.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
What happens when you give a stellar cast nothing to do?,"Let me just lay all my cards on the table, so there are no surprises later in the review: ""Inside Man"" is frustratingly bad, Spike Lee was the wrong director for this, but I was able to walk away still a fan of Clive Owen, Denzel Washington, and Jodie Foster. This is a bizarre film, unnecessarily complicated, that assembles a top-notch cast, puts them into a tense situation with all the players in place, and then has nothing to do with them. It's like the writer forgot that you needed a third act; it's all rising action with no denouement.Washington plays Det. Frazier, a hostage negotiator who acts, literally, as if this is his first case. He has the obligatory younger partner (Chiwetel Ejiofor, ""Serenity"") who exists so Frazier can explain his theories and the obligatory ESU commander who wants to go in and shoot everyone (Willem Dafoe, sadly underused). Owen plays the bank robber, about whom frustratingly nothing is known except what he said into the camera in the trailer. Finally, Foster plays some sort of player amongst the Powers That Be who walks into the mayor's office, demands an update, and is given ""every possible courtesy"", etc. She serves no purpose whatsoever, not even in a clich√©d action movie type of way like Dafoe and Ejiofor. The performances are the only good part of the movie, but there are times when you can tell that the actors wished they were in a better film. They're giving it their all, and they're getting no help from anyone else involved.Spike Lee is up to his usual tricks here, which, in this type of movie, is a very bad thing. The details of the heist itself I won't disclose. I can't. The action is, at best, vague - extremely brief scenes of vaults opening, hole-digging, hostage roughing up, and the usual bank-robber stuff are all the details we really get. It is also inter cut with scenes of the hostages recalling the heist; their recollections serve no purpose except to confuse the audience further. ""Inside Man"" is curiously racist: the white crooks rough up the black bank customers, the white Foster and the mayor order around Washington, the white cops mistake a Sikh for an Arab and beat him, and even a Jewish hostage was not only a lawyer, but has a nephew who is a jeweler. Washington and Ejiofor are given no flaws whatsoever and are seen mostly being pushed around by everyone else in the movie. The action repeatedly grinds to a halt so Lee can insert quirky little subplots involving video games, Washington's much younger girlfriend and random Albanian women. They're at best unnecessary, at worst, disastrous. If we had been given a director with more focus, there is the feeling that this could have been a lean, mean thriller. But it drags and drags and drags and when we get to the end, we understand why the film stalled for so long: the ending is about as climatic as erectile dysfunction.""Inside Man"" looked like it had it all - great cast, good concept, reputable director, but the end result is a near-disaster. It's like someone threw ""Dog Day Afternoon"" into a blender, drank it, and vomited it back onto the screen. As I stumbled out of the theater, deprived of my money and time, I cursed the screen gods who thought to tease me with such an improbably bad movie. I thought back to a better day, when a movie at least knew what was going on even if the audience didn't, gave us characters who seemed like actual people and served actual purposes to the plot, so that even if we had to wait until the Big Twist to answer our questions, we at least had a reason to still care.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Surprisingly brilliant!,"it was surprisingly really, really good! Probably the most unpredictable thriller to come out of Hollywood in a long time. Clive Owen and Denzel Washington are brilliant, but for me Jodie Foster steals the show. One of her best supporting roles to date. I was a little surprised when i saw it, thinking it was going to be another one of those boring American thrillers, but i was happily surprised to see a complicated, intelligent film with some interesting political undertones. One thing i would say that really annoyed me about this film was the incredibly irritating music in the opening credits. It had absolutely no reference to the film and it felt really out of place. At times the sweeping camera shots get on your nerves, but when you get into the film, the exciting and interesting plot helps you to forget all about it!",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Okay, but had the potential to be brilliant","A gang holds up a bank, takes hostages and is trapped inside the bank by police. A police hostage negotiator arrives and takes charge but the gang don't seem to be following the usual playbook. Even more mysteriously, the chairman of the bank has hired his own negotiator.Intriguing and riveting...initially. The movie was set up to be a great heist drama, with a large dose of mystery thrown in. I was looking forward to see the course of events unfold and the puzzle be solved (or, even better, figure it out myself).Unfortunately, the level of intrigue and uncertainty reduces almost immediately as we have flash-forwards that give away elements of the outcome of the bank siege. From a point you can see how the siege is going to pan out.The bank chairman / private negotiator aspect, something which I initially thought was unnecessary and just detracted from the main story, becomes more important and adds intrigue, but it also serves to muddy the plot somewhat. More disappointingly, this sub-plot becomes the main plot and results in a unsatisfactory, smug, moralising conclusion.Overall, interesting enough but also quite disappointing as it could have been so much better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Good but not the movie to remember in that genre,"This movie does its job well.It's about a police man that is on the move when a robbery happens in a bank, quite a standard scenario although I can applaud the variant of seeing more from the cops point of view than the criminal for once.All actors/actresses are great but, in my opinion, the script is missing that emotion that makes you wanna keep on watching the movie and same goes for the way it's filmed, clean framing but no risk is taken. I find it quite sad because I truly feel like Spike Lee could have made something memorable if he had went out of his comfort zone.It's not a bad movie, far from it, but I know that, in all honesty, I won't remember it in two months; does well on a Sunday night when you just want something easy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
This bank robber is gonna walk right out the door...when he's good 'n ready,"In a prosperous Manhattan bank in broad daylight, a group of thugs dressed like painters walk in and take control of the building--but what they're after is another story altogether. When a movie-watching audience invests their faith in a good filmmaker, such as Spike Lee is here, you can almost feel the giddy anticipation rising up in the theater; you know this picture is going to be a satisfying adventure because you implicitly trust where the director is taking you. Aside from several fast-forwards in time (which are confusing at first) and a let's-just-say sequence (visualized for us) wherein the police discuss storming the building, this is a twisty, marvelously absorbing cops-and-crooks thriller with fantastic characters. Denzel Washington plays the lead detective, his head already on the block from a former case, trying to decipher what these ""bank robbers"" actually want (at one point saying to the leader, ""You don't want a plane! You saw ""Dog Day Afternoon""...you're stalling!""); Clive Owen is the intensely focused gang leader; Christopher Plummer is the bank's wealthy owner who has a ""special interest"" in one of the safe deposit boxes; and Jodie Foster is the flirtatious, unscrupulous negotiator helping Plummer get what he wants. Perhaps some of the intricate details don't bear close scrutiny, however the set-up and follow-through are both marvelous. Screenwriter Russell Gewirtz should work with Spike Lee more often--together they make an unbeatable combination. ***1/2 from ****",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Stalemate,"Although it sets off pretty well, with Clive Owen talking straight to the camera saying he has the perfect plan to rob a bank, that he is 100 percent sure that his plan is flawless. We always see movies with bank robberies being the criminals risky and edgy, and repeating sometimes the same techniques and same lines. Well with the new optic of this film, one is excited. He planned it so precisely, so extensively he believes there is no possible flail. Well, this declaration is the only thing that the movie can claim of distinguished.Following this interesting commence, the movie will set with a boring brain fight between the chief police and the principal robber. Different ""interests"" for an account of the bank set an uninteresting premise where the script just doesn't go anywhere. I repeat, it promises more than whatever it delivers. The final and the twist are somewhat good, but doesn't surprise as the story doesn't introduce us to the characters correctly and we simply don't care. It appears to be a distinguished, different, excellent film. Avoid it, because it just isn't so.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A mess of a movie,"After painfully watching the last boring minutes of Inside Man I just wanted to look at IMDb to verify that I had just seen one of the worst movies of 2006. Then I saw its rating ... 7.5 ?!?!? What ?!?! After reading through all those comments I'm finally convinced that IMDb is badly invaded by professional movie pushers. To make it worse, this film is additionally pushed by Spike Lee & Denzel Washington fanatics.This film has many problems: the script is awful, without any tension or suspense. Denzel plays the same over-the-top super-cop as many of his movies before (I won't watch Denzel movies in the near future). Jodie's character is laughable, she just doesn't add anything to the movie except her name. Chris Plummer has the most notable moments in the movie but he also suffers from the bad script.The music score is unnerving and way to much in most of the scenes. And Mr. Lee's direction is screams Scorsese at you with all those angles, camera moves and steadycam shots. They don't help the story but make the movie look strangely dated, like a movie of the 90s.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Inside Out,"I want to like Spike, I really do. He has a natural cinematic imagination, something you can see from the very beginning. And he is flamboyant with the camera which I appreciate when the confidence is rewarded.Plus other things. He seems to have backed off his ""I'm not an Oscar-winner because I'm black"" routine, as demeaning as any ""Bamboozled"" riff. The title is ambiguously intelligent, and I thought perhaps we would have some sort of folding on the nature of man imposed on the heist genre. (We did get that plus the energetic camera with ""Good Thief."") Also, whenever Dafoe steps into a project, my anticipation level rises because sometimes these are so intelligently shaped that I imagine religions being founded on them.I overlooked the problems I knew would come with Denzel and Jodi. I'm sure they are nice people and solid workers and all that. But actors come in distinct types, having made different choices about whether they will try to enter our souls and if so, how. Both of these defer.Here's the good: in the parts of this where the overlong the script calls for energy, he supplies it masterfully. In scenes that would normally drag, he gives us a mildly dancing camera. Nice. And if you like heist puzzles, you might get engaged in guessing how our mastermind will pull this off. Its a sort of detective story form imposed on the actual crime, and it inexplicably starts with that mastermind speaking directly to the audience via a camera he has arranged. This intelligently overlaps with videotaped interviews of the hostages that are woven through the recounting of the crime. Following Ted's law, the nature of these interviews is separated in abstract distance from the main action the same degree as the action from us.All that will be enough for some viewers.The main problem is the script. These things are cast as a battle of wits among giants. In this case the two giants are supposed to be our genius criminal and the Denzel character who faces off against him. Also in the mix is an undescribed character played by Jodi Foster. She is supposed to be a master fixer who can make anything happen.We don't know much about her. Actually what we are shown gives us little confidence in her powers. So the task of elevating the character to the level of our genius crook is up to her. I sincerely think she would flub it even if the script supported her. She's just not a powerful or interesting person. The script supports the master manipulative abilities of the Plummer character slightly more, but it slips off quickly, about the time we see him in the zoom- pullback shot (used twice!), where his grinning face is shown while a character explains what is so evil about him.The second problem is the pacing. Spike is a local intuitive. He famously goes by his gut when approaching a scene. We can see this in many scenes in all his work: they just tingle. But he has no sense for the long form, the composition of the whole movie. This means he can sort of get by when his audience is TeeVee watchers and the point of the thing is that the character is drifting. But this film should be a fine-tuned assembly, as masterfully managed as the heist within. Soderbergh knows how to fold his movie-making on an elaborate heist. Spike wouldn't understand it if you drew it on a napkin for him.And a final problem is the facts in the case. When these things are all over, we get a thrill in putting it all together. Oh, that's why the crooks spent time mingling with the hostages. But to play this game, the facts have to add up, like the lock gears used heavily in the title sequence. And they don't. There are huge questions that get in the way. Shucks. Advertising this as a thinking person's thriller doesn't make it so.Oh. And there's that junky shot that Spike invented I guess, because he just has to use it. Our hero being pulled on a carriage linked to the camera. Its supposed to show forward progress or determination you see. Pure junk.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

I would like to leave just one question: Why Mr. Arthur Case, magnificently played by Christopher Plummer, kept such evidences that could destroy his successful life for almost sixty years in a safe? The whole story spins around this ridiculous situation. If you want to see a film of heist, prefer to watch again ""Dog Day Afternoon"" or even ""Heist"", but do not spend your time or money with ""Inside Man"".

And think about how much an open sewer smells and might draw attention after a week.This is the frustrating thing about these sorts of movies-- the writers have massive gaps in the storyline, and must think that the audience is not bright enough to see right through them.

First really worthy film of 2006,"""Inside Man"" is a terrific film and a reminder that Spike Lee is still one of the best filmmakers in town. The film starts off as homage to ""Dog Day Afternoon"" and ends up a clever and entertaining heist drama like ""The Hot Rock"". First time writer Russell Gewirtz daft script sets up what would be a predictable scenario and turns into an intelligent caper with colorful characters and feasible situations. It has a nice 70's feeling to it and relays on the plot and characters to move the story instead of the overblown ""Bad Boys"" action mentality. Some people may find it anti-climatic but I think it works perfectly keeping situations at a low-key pace and the outcome is satisfying. Many may wonder why Spike Lee would direct a film he did not have a hand in writing; but after seeing the film you can understand because the script is that good. Another thing in Spike Lee's favor is him being a New Yorker; other than Sidney Lumet (in his prime) there are not too many directors who could capture that city and flesh out its character(s). The cast is perfect with Denzel Washington in fine form as usual, Clive Owen, Jodie Foster, Willem Dafoe, and the wonderful Chiwetel Ejiofor who has a great interplay with Washington. The integration scenes with them are priceless. The film is the first highlight of 2006.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Inside Man,"As heist films go, this isn't at all bad. Spike Lee and Denzel Washington's ""Det. Frazier"" keep the drama going and although quite few, the twists do keep you guessing. Jodie Foster and Christopher Plummer appear sparingly, but they contribute quite substantially to the rather more evil and interesting sub-plot - despite the presence of the unusually stolid Clive Owen whose role as ""Russell"" is pivotal to the accruing sense of peril and cleverly planned mischief. This movie touches upon social and religious mores a little, though I wouldn't say this was Lee at his most political - and this all adds to an enjoyable multi-layered story.

A new standard has been set for a heist film,"When I saw the trailer for Inside Man at King Kong, I instantly became obsessed with this film. I waited for 4 long months for this, and I thought that maybe my expectations would be too high. Turns out, my expectations were not high enough because the film was amazing and brilliant.Plot: Just when you think you got it all figured out, you don't. ANd then when you REALLY think you got it all figured out, you realize that you REALLY don't. In fact, once the ending credits come, you still probably don't know what just happened. Its simplistic at times. Its complex. Its confusing. Its brilliant.Acting: Well, the marketing for this film relied heavy on star power. You know why people go to see films with certain actors? Because those actors are DAMN GOOD actors. And none of the actors disappointed here. Dafoe and Foster did as expected, and Washington and Owen continue to amaze me. Owen steals the show(as he usually does).Directing: This movie is just another statement showing that Spike Lee is indeed one of the best directors alive today. Once I heard ""Chal Chaiyya Chaiyya"" come on in the opening credits, I knew that Spkie was going to give me something special. Everything...is just so beautiful. That's all I can say.The only weak point for this is that it starts to drag at the end and there are a occaionsal plot holes but they are REALLY small. But other than that, this is probably the best heist film since Dog Day Afternoon(which ironically is mentioned in the film).9/10.

Good - but not that good,"I went in to this film with high expectations due to the cast and whilst their performances were fairly good, the film as a whole was not as great as I'd hoped. As a hostage movie I found The Negotiator with Sam Jackson far more entertaining and the start of Swordfish with Hugh Jackman far more exciting (the worlds largest walking claymore mines). I found the story interesting but once I got the gist of what was going on I just found myself wanting to get to the end, not really caring what happened along the way. As a bank robbery movie I found the whole process of Oceans 11 and Heat far more interesting and cerebral. I won't give anything away and talk about the ending, but when it comes, considering the fairly slow build up, it is one of those ""oh right"" moments but it doesn't hit you like the ending of Planet of the Apes or The Usual Suspects. So to summarise, an interesting journey, but not one to add to your DVD collection for repeated viewing. It gets a 7 mainly for the 2 central performances from Owen & Washington and for Jodie foster looking great for once (good riddance to those awful Silence of the Lambs FBI clothes)",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Great Movie!,"I thought Inside Man was a really great movie!! In the movie Clive Owens really did plan a perfect bank robbery......making all the hostages wear the same jumpsuit etc. There was some violence such as people getting beat up. Also, in a video game the little boy was playing there was violence. There was also many curse words. Inside Man wasn't a happy, prancing bunny movie but it wasn't a movie where somebody's getting shot every 2 minutes. You'll have to go and see it to see how everything works out. My favorite character is an up and coming star, Samantha Ivers playing Nancy Mann, one of the hostages. In the beginning of the movie she's the one standing on line in the bank talking really loud on her cell phone and you can follow her throughout the movie from that point. Inside Man was an excellent movie..... I give it a 10!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Having a twist at the end does't automatically mean the movie as a whole is clever or well written.,"All that praise for this movie...while it in my opinion is nothing more than a simple written but very well directed heist movie which cast and style still make this an entertaining enough and certainly watchable movie. It however is a movie with a tad more misses than hits really.Main problem for me was the story. Over and over again it is told in the movie that this is the perfect bank robbery. Quite frankly I really don't see back in the movie why exactly the plan is such a brilliant one. Also the twist at the end left me cold and it was far from satisfying for me. I found the story to be simple and formulaic written. The movie tried to make itself seem more complex and clever but putting some non-linear story lines in the movie but its all not enough to make the story seem more interesting or any more clever. Spike Lee's directing however certainly spiced things up and manged to give the movie still some flair and an excellent 'cool' atmosphere. Nevertheless the movie and its story just didn't hit me as clever, surprising or perfectly solidly written, which made the movie as a whole to me a bit simple although it certainly still was perfectly entertaining to watch.""Inside Man"" isn't really a movie that allows itself to be put in a corner. It's hard to classify this movie as to what genre it is. As a thriller it isn't tense enough and as a crime movie it isn't clever and tough enough. For most part the movie is mostly entertaining to watch but than again at the same time the movie tries to handle some more serious and delicate matters. Best example of this are of course the racial and discriminating issues, a returning element in Spike Lee movies. The moments felt forced, out of place and totally unneeded. Because this movie doesn't really fit in a genre its hard to known how and with what approach or distance to watch this movie.The cast is impressive, perhaps a bit too. Denzel Washington is perfectly in his element, as yet again a police detective. He seems to be getting with every movie I see him in. Clive Owen isn't as impressive but he is a good actor and he plays his role convincing and 'cool' enough. The movie also has Jodie Foster and Christopher Plummer in it but it makes you wonder why. Their roles are small and don't seem significant enough, even though they play an important part in the story. This is mainly because their screen time is too limited and it feels like a huge waste of talent. Jodie Foster normally picks her roles very carefully and it makes me wonder why she ever agreed to be in this movie. Willem Dafoe on the other hand again is a perfect, pleasant and most welcome addition to the star-filled cast.This movie still shows that Spike Lee is a great talented director with a nose for the business. This unfortunately in this case only shows in its style. The movie has some great executed- and almost artistically style-full sequences. It to me was the only reason why this movie still was a good- and entertaining enough movie to watch, for the story and its character left me cold mostly.Simple entertainment. Style-full but not solid.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Outstanding movie,"This is a must see film. I didn't want it to end, and I hope the writer does a sequel. I read an article saying he never wrote a screenplay before, never bought a book on how to write one, or took a class. He simply downloaded scripts off the internet and then wrote his. It should only be so easy. The only disappointment is Jodie Foster, who is so plastic she does not ring true with the other characters. Her part is small enough not to mar the film. There are more ethnic references in this movie than there are ethnicities in NYC -- starting with a song from the Indian musical ""Bombay Dreams"" that sets the tempo for the film over the opening credits. There is no Aha Moment in this movie, it sneaks up and around you, and then it is over. The buzz on this one is going to carry it to box office heights.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Plot holes and weak twists aside, Inside Man just reeks ""coolness"" however you look at it...","After attending it's press premiere here in Tel Aviv, Israel, the best thing I can say about Inside Man (2006), is that it's a very, very cool film. Plot holes and weak twists aside, this film just reeks ""coolness"" however you look at it. From the extremely stylish opening credits with the shaky camera movements, the brisk New York scenery and the uplifting Indian music; onto the powerful performances by Denzel Washington, Clive Owen (which just gets better and better every film) and veteran actor Christopher Plummer, and up until that moment where the plot finally unfolds and the Indian music starts rolling again - Inside Man is a fun, if unsatisfying, roller coaster ride. That being said, the only obvious conclusions one can assume after watching this film is that A) Spike Lee has once again proved his well achieved acknowledgment for being a very talented director, and B) he did the best he could given the subject material he was given. Oh, by the way, two time Academy Award winner Jodie Foster and two time Academy Award nominee Willem Dafoe also appear in this film, and give excellent performances at that, although their screen time is very limited, and makes you wonder if it was worth their efforts or not.For those who insist on plot details, take in mind that it's hard describing it without giving away potential spoilers, but I'll do the best I can. The film starts by presenting us Dalton Russell (Owen), a bank robber who confesses in front of the camera about his part in leading an extremely elaborate scheme he had recently pulled off with the help of some colleagues. What he exactly robbed, how he did it and why, is where the real fun begins. Because most of the characters in Inside Man are not what they may seem, and you'll find yourself not really knowing which side to cheer for when the curtain comes up. In the meanwhile, we flash back to the moment the scheme initiated, where we find Owen and his fellow robbers taking over a Chase Manhattan branch in Manhattan, New York. Keith Frazier (Academy Award winner Denzel Washington) is a NYPD cop who takes over the situation, trying to negotiate with Russell to retreat from the bank, where a hostage crisis quickly begins. But Russell isn't the ordinary criminal. He takes his time, doesn't seem to keen on robbing the place's assets and has all sorts of weird and unrealistic demands from the negotiation team. In comes Madeleine White (Foster), a very mysterious middle-woman who is sent to the scene by the bank's head of trusties, with a strange agenda of her own.Yeah, I know it sounds cool on the outside, but don't be tricked too quickly ¬ñ the whole point of this motion picture is to look, sound and feel cool. The resolution is interesting, yet nothing we haven't seen before. If you're looking for a major resolution or for an original idea, don't get your hopes too high. But if you're looking for harmless fun, superb acting and rhythmic direction, and can skip some used ideas; you'll find Inside Man to be a fun ride in the theaters, and a tad bit better than your average matin√©e.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Great!,"I really enjoyed this movie. The actors were good. The story was good and there were plenty of funny lines that I guffawed at. Denzel Washington was great as the NY cop who had to negotiate with Clive Owen, also great, who was holding hostages in a bank. Spike Lee's direction was superb. There were no throw away scenes. Take for example the cell phone scene where the criminals told everyone to dump their phones into a sack. That could have been handled very differently but it was prolonged and stretched out to provide a suspenseful scene. The incident didn't really have much to do with the main plot but it was handled so well you were on the edge of your seat waiting to see what would happen. There were many scenes like that. Ordinary events, well ordinary for this type of movie, were treated with respect and used to provide entertainment and not just thrown away. This is a movie that you would want to see again after you know the whole plot just to see how they went about the caper. Another scene I enjoyed was the interview with one of the women about section 34DD. The tension created with this small scene was wonderful. Will he look or not?

A rip roaring robbery riot,"When the movie trailer for Match Point starring Scarlett Johanssen starting showing up in my favorite multi-plex last year, I remember being mildly intrigued at the premise then being blown away when it was revealed at the end of the ad that the film was directed by none other than Mr. Woody Allen.Wha? Mr. ""Look at my neurotic bitching"" is directing a suspense/thriller? Whoa! My interest went through the roof as I couldn't remember the last time ¬ñ of ever ¬ñ that I had been so surprised at the genre choice for a directors upcoming effort.Well, it happened again with the new bank heist flick, Inside Man. The trailer and ads lead me down a guessing path wherein I was spewing out guesses such as F. Gary Gray or Brett Ratner as the man behind the camera. But when the final credit revealed itself, I sat jaw agape as ""a spike lee joint"" flashed upon the screen. The March 24th release date was then circled on the office calendar.Inside Man does have one marking of a Spike Lee film ¬ñ Denzel Washington. The two have shared movie poster credits with films such as Malcolm X, Mo Better Blues and He Got Game. They are the black man's George Clooney and Steven Soderbergh. And that can be a very good thing.Inside Man also boasts some incredible talent in support of Mr. Training Day. Academy Award winners or nominees galore surround Denzel with names like Foster, Dafoe and Owen. Altogether, they fight for marquee supremacy while giving the viewer the biggest barge or egos since Ocean's Twelve.So the only question remaining was can all these remarkable talents join together and actually make a good film.Inside Man is a movie about a bank robbery. Clive Owen plays Dalton Russell, the man behind the operation who in the opening sequences narration, lets us know that he puts together the perfect crime. His attempt to rob Case Manhattan Bank leads to Denzel's Detective Keith Fraizer being assigned as the hostage negotiator. Complicating matters and unknown to the paying customer until necessary is what exactly is being stolen. Dalton seems to have little to no interest in all the money that surrounds him in the vault and the owner of the bank, Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer) seems so concerned about a personal belonging kept in the vault's safety deposit box that he employs the services of one Madeline White (Jodie Foster). Her background is never quite revealed, but what is crystal is that she is as tough as nails and has the right markers to protect the interests and reputation of Mr. Case.So the table is set. The characters are in place. Fraizer will try and talk Dalton out of killing anyone in the bank while White will try and arbitrate the negotiations and offer both sides future benefits for walking away from escalating the situation larger than the severity it has already reached.Inside Man is a better than average film with a much better than average cast. Denzel and Owen provide refreshing performances with characters that have been done before ¬ñ and many times over. Their screen time together sizzles with tension and an understanding as to each others role in how the final act will play out.Foster's participation on the other hand is less impressive. Foster does her best in a limited role and definitely commands a presence on the screen, but you can't help but feel that she is a bit wasted when the final product is revealed and the end credits roll.But maybe most impressive is the directing of Spike Lee. We are used to his heavy handed films that are steep with racial tension. And although Inside Man does have its moments of racial indifference (most particularly a comedic breaking scene with a bank employee who's turbin has been taken by the police during a take-down) ¬ñ Lee understands that the film at hand is that of a bank robbery and the attempts to salvage the hostage situation. He keeps things tight, moving and towards an end that even yours truly couldn't figure out until the results were revealed.That in short makes Inside Man one of the better films of the still new year and revives a Lee career that hasn't produced anything interesting since The 25th hour five years ago.www.robertsreviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Spike Lee does it again,"From the start the public gets a serious hint (a bloke in a cell) that it will end all wrong. The only question remains...how...Then the story starts.. It is shown how a group of people infiltrates a bank and hostages everyone(story well known and too much movies about that...)Soo what about this movie makes it so special? First of all Danzel Washington does a great job. He represents the maybe unexperienced, but clever guy of the corps(like in every bank-robbery movie there is only one of that kind). Second Jodie Foster gives the movie a mysterious - I know people with power that can hurt you real bad - touch . She plays kind of a problem solver that people (only very rich ones) can hire to solve their dirty little problems. This time she works for the founder of the bank. Her mission is to get the content of a safe before the bank robbers get their fingers on it...Clive Owen is without doubt the most brilliant actor of the movie. He first represents the evil...but after some while he starts to show his human side, a metamorphose that he performed extremely well.Although Gewirtz managed to give the story an unexpected swing, a big part of the story can be predicted from the start. Sometimes things are just too obvious. The end of the hostage taking is so predictable that you can go to the toilet for fifteen minutes and after that things will be just like you predicted.

So I didn't really have that high of expectations. However, I have to admit that this movie is extremely well made. It's evident from the beginning of the movie. In the first 5 minutes of the movie the camera shot changes every five seconds. Normally this would just annoy me, but the editor managed to do this without wasting a single one of those five second shots, and with great accompanying music it was actually one of my favorite opening sequences ever. While the camera work is great throughout what really makes this movie stand out are the great performances by the two leads. Clive Owen is great as a ""not your everyday bankrobber"" and Washington is wonderful, somehow giving an incredibly fresh performance in spite of the fact that he's playing a cop for what seams like the 11th time in his past 12 films. Its an interesting story with some decent twists and better than average dialouge. This is just a very good movie with something for almost everybody.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A waste of time. Dumb. Two stars out of five.,"Who chooses the main comment that shows below the movie? They're almost always so positive, even when, as in this case, the movie doesn't deserve it. This is one of those movies with so many twists and turns in the plot that the whole story feels completely faked-up. It gets boring after the fifth or sixth plot ""surprise."" Yeah, yeah, so things are not what they seem - AGAIN. Maybe it's all going to turn out to be that they're only making a movie of a robbery instead of a real robbery, and the cop is just dreaming it. Who cares?Acting - did someone say Jodie Foster did a commendable job? Holy {blank}, what baloney. She overacts something terrible, making faces in an attempt to express some sort of feeling and strutting around, for no particular reason, like king of the hill. As if this kind of movie requires acting anyway.We've just got to say something about the dialogue writer - a clever young fellow straight out of script writer's school is my guess. He makes such an effort to be sharp and punchy that the dialogue often turns the characters into two-dimensional figures, mere mouthpieces. It keeps making you think, ""People don't talk like that"" and ""Where did she come up with a line like that at such a moment."" The characters often seem totally unbelievable. I'd say Jodie Foster's character is the worst for that, unlike anyone conceivable in real life.And how about these bookends for the movie? At the beginning Denzel wants to go home and have sex with his wife. After all the complicated action, the movie ends with him going home and having sex with her. Wow, what a satisfying way to end. Oh, and at the start he's under a cloud of suspicion and - miracle of miracles - he's told at the end that the cloud has been lifted. No more story to it than that, just a completely pointless, bare addition to the story, as if the writers created it at the last minute by inserting four or five extra lines of dialogue here and there. Stupid.Stay away from this stinker of a movie. I'm mad at this movie for wasting my time and insulting my intelligence. Come on, Spike, do your thing with socially relevant films, not forgettable schlock like this junk.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Very engaging and entertaining,"I read a lot of the comments. And yes, many people find holes in the story but... Here is my perspective: I have not seen a decent movie in a loooong time. I found myself totally engaged. It went very fast (A good sign!). It made me think. It was like a classic old movie with a modern look and feel to it. And yes it is fantasy, and thats why it is a movie and not real life. And one should go in and just relax and let oneself be in the movie. If I had to find negatives: 1) Jodie Foster is too obviously trying to say: ""I have aged but I am still sexy"" ... That felt a little needy. 2) Denzel Washington: We all like him. But is he acting? or is this himself. He appears exactly as he always does: Confident, on top of things and always keeping a good sense of humor. Biggest positives: 1) FUN movie. 2) The New York cultural mix. 3) Spike Lee's creativity.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Instant classic,"The fact that this movie was directed (note: NOT written) by Spike Lee lead a lot of people to believe that ""Inside Man"" was really a subliminal comment on racial issues. Yes, there are characters using politically incorrect terms here and a major plot point even involves the exploitation of Jews during the holocaust. Still, ""Inside Man"" is foremost a classic heist movie and a very good one at that.Spike Lee takes his time to tell this story. Like so many recent motion pictures ""Inside Man"" is almost of epic proportions, yet at 130 minutes running time it still manages never to get boring. It sucks you right in from the great opening monologue delivered by Clive Owen. Lee's direction is old-fashioned and classy. The cast is superb, although it's a pity that Willem Dafoe plays a rather bland character and isn't given more opportunity to show his talent here.Newcomer Russell Gewirtz wrote a fantastic screenplay, that's extremely well crafted and very original. A lot of background information is left in the dark, which probably frustrated some viewers, but actually we don't need to know more facts than the ones we are being given in the movie. Granted, some parts of the movie are rather hard to believe, but the story never reaches the point of absolute impossibility. Another reviewer wrote that the movie's main flaw is that it refuses to choose between realism and ""Ocean's Eleven""-style fantasy. I think that's a good way to put it, but the makers could have gone way farther over the top. To me the movie found the perfect balance between realism and fantasy to be thrilling and plausible at the same time.""Inside Man"" is already a classic and definitely among Spike Lee's best movies. Hopefully it will be remembered along with genre cornerstones such as ""Dog Day Afternoon"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"Personally, totally satisfied with every aspect of this film....","Just viewed the DVD at home, alone, tonight and was surprised at how much I enjoyed it as I had been ""warned"" it was confusing and hard to follow....perhaps, having been told that, I payed more attention. Aside from the usual: great acting, directing, story-line, etc. I wanted to comment that although at first I found the music to be a little overbearing I soon came to appreciate it as an exciting part of the film which somehow reminded me of another action flick but I can't recall which at the moment....perhaps a Harrison Ford film. I disagree with those who felt the F word was overused or unnecessary because in situations like that with supposed characters like that it is inevitable in a New York world. I was glad to see Chris Plummer still in the game - I can't help wishing he were {still} a younger man and had many years ahead to delight us...yet, here's hoping we'll see more of him.

Quality pot-boiler with grade A stars -- but certainly not a keeper.,"A gang of thieves take over a New York bank - but maybe there is more to it than a simple robbery-turned-hostage situation? When you get to a certain age you think you have seen all the movies that have been made or ever will be made. All you have left to look forward to is massive surprises (and very welcome they are too!) and movies that are bits and pieces of other (good) movies glued together.This is a very slick product with modern cinematography - the type is part TV advert and part professional clever-dicking: Arty shots for no real reason other than to show-off.Not the kind of material that I normally associate with Spike Lee (there is a back story if you want to search it out) but he gets us through it without ever stopping or running out of ideas. Not that a hundred directors couldn't have done it just as well.Get this for a cast: Denzel Washington (call-the-shots big city cop), Clive Owen (too good looking for his own good as a young man - now getting more interesting with age. Here a pro thief), Jodie Foster (not playing a goody-two-shoes character for once - won't spoil it), Christopher Plummer (a standard Mr Big) and William Dafoe (wasted as a police coordinator). Thankfully they are rarely on screen at the same time - probably because they would be too many arguments about who is getting blocked correctly and who has the individual spot on them.I have a problem with Denzel W - he is a very good actor that doesn't take on enough challenging parts. He has fallen in to the Sidney Poitier trap of thinking that he should be representing his race in nearly every movie (yes -- irony that he won an Oscar for the time he didn't) or else doing those walk-through parts that keeps his bank manager happy. Here he is good, but nothing special. I want to give him special praise for his command of the English language though - even though he doesn't display it here. He should come to London and do Shakespeare.I counted myself entertained and satisfied at the end of the two hours. Too superficial to watch more than once though.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"Well made absolutely, but a hair long, and a hair routine...","Inside Man (2006)An attempt at the mainstream by Spike Lee, and a really solid bank heist movie with Clive Owen and Denzel Washington at the two poles of the story, bad guy and good guy. The meaning of the title isn't clear until the last five minutes.Heist movies are partly about the mechanics and ingenuity of the plan, and this one is good. At first it all unfolds with alarming routine, but Lee manages to change it up after awhile by have some flash-forwards that make us re-evaluate the main plot as it happens. There are a couple of sub-plots and one of them, using Jodie Foster, is important but forced on us. But the main heist isn't enough for a full blooded movie of this kind, so there is a script weakness somewhere here.Washington as the main detective (embattled, of course) is charming and effective. He can make any movie click in his scenes. And Owen is strong in his own usual way, but we get a weirdly limited view of him because he is almost always covered with hood, mask, and sunglasses. No facial intensity here.The filming is pure Lee, with lots of moving camera and a few simple special effects, elegant and oddly a hair old fashioned. In fact, as much as I admire Lee's best films, you get a sense he's riding an old wave, a little like Woody Allen (another NYC auteur director) keeps an older style going even in his most recent films. If, for a comparison, David Fincher had made ""Inside Man"" I think we would see some kind of verve and intensity and originality that Lee somehow avoids.But well made this is, and don't get it wrong, if you like crime and caper movies at all, this is one to see. I wish there was a director's cut that was 20 minutes shorter, but nestle on the couch and let it flow.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"Entertaining  overall, but slow in the middle","I mostly liked this Spike Lee film, but I wondered early on if Denzel's cop character was going to turn out to be the real ""Inside Man"". He did get a gift from the genius bank robber at the end. Why? It was probably a token from the genius crook, who by that act was paying a smart detective handsomely for the rare challenge to his brilliance, or maybe for not being smart enough to catch him? With Spike, it has to be the former. And, actually, in the end, the detective actually did the bank robber's dirty work for him that cost the Big Cheese dearly and maybe even bought him down, so the detective worked out to be the brilliant crook's Inside Man after all. Pretty formulaic, but sharp and engrossing. Denzel was his usual very impressive, cool cat self and Clive Owen as the genius crook was terrific.Jodie Foster played a powerful rich bitch very well, one who rubbed viewer noses in something smelly that we already know, that the filthy rich are very different than the rest of us(maybe it's the money and the power and all the rest( and can do what they want to the rest of us. She did provide an important connection to the real bad rich guy of the story who paid her well for her slick work, and her bitchchick role was a great choice for the fixer between Denzel's cop and the Very Big bad banker. I liked the way that part was pulled off and the creative and suspenseful conclusion. In the end I thought it was worth the slow pace and lightweight violence that dragged it down midway.Spike Lee's boring and out of date racist drone of the white guys always being the bad guys and the black guys always being the good guys is getting real old. Not very realistic today, just like a lot of this film. But, it was a good story of a smart and creative caper and that is enough to make me recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Recently, I planned, and set in motion, the events to execute the perfect bank robbery.","Inside Man is directed by Spike Lee and written by Russell Gewirtz. It stars Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Willem Dafoe, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jodie Foster and Christopher Plummer. Music is by Terence Blanchard and cinematography by Matthew Libatique.A heist of a New York bank is being undertaken by exceptionally well organised crims. Led by intelligent Dalton Russell (Owen), the robbers appear to have every eventuality covered. NYPD detectives Frazier (Washington) and Mitchell (Ejiofor) are assigned the case and set about unstitching the volatile situation. But nothing is as it seems, especially since ruthless ""fixer"" Madeleine White (Foster) shows up to broker a deal with the robbers on behalf of the bank's owner (Plummer).Spike Lee does a formulaic movie? Surely not? Well yes and no, the genre staples are adhered too but Lee stamps his own authority on proceedings. Where aided by a tricksy and well written script by first timer Gewirtz, he has crafted one of the best heist movies in the modern era. Propelled by a cast on excellent form, Inside Man always has a trick up its sleeve, while characters motivations and reasoning's are always sketchy, thus making the audience just as suspicious as Washington's driven detective is. With Lee choosing a choppy chronology process to unfurl the plot, this too helps to keep the nagging narrative question of ""what is going on?"" to consistently linger in the air. And with multiple characters ducking in and out of the story, it's a credit to Lee and Gewirtz that the film is neatly streamlined, it's never confusing and always gripping.How Lee moulds the character dynamics at play always holds the attention, be it the battle of wits between Washington & Owen, or the Foster and Plummer ask no questions axis, no frame or dialogue exchange is wasted. The director even manages to slip in a couple of statements of race related bother involving a Sikh and a copper who gets pulled up on his terminology. While an aside at violent video games sneakily slips in with ironic potency. For sure this is no ""Spike Lee message movie,"" but his awareness of the times, and particularly New York's denizens, never wanes. Blanchard provides some wonderful snatches of music, at times sounding very James Bondian, it adds a nice espionage like flavour into the New York melting pot. As for the ending? Well more like as for the series of reveals? It's cracker-jack time, no cop outs or reverting to type, it's a fitting finale to what has gone before it.It's not flawless, some little problems reside within, but they are not large ones. Though it is fair to say that if you are someone who makes a point of working things out as soon as possible? Then you are able to do so here, though I do think the makers aren't exactly hiding it, in fact we are dared to pay attention right from the off as Owen's mastermind looks us in the eye and tells us so. But small itches aside, this is darn entertaining stuff, a film that can raise the pulse and hold you in suspense, whilst also demanding you engage the brain as well. 8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Not all that :(,I honestly thought that it could have been better it was sort of a wannabe Oceans 11. Thought out quite well but not all that great the very end of the movie just before the credits had a nice scene but all in all it was really far fetched. I expected more suspense or something to give it some IMF. Wasn't the worst movie I've seen this year but wasn't the best. All in all Denzels performance was good as usual but the rest of the actors were nothing great. Spike Lee uses a lot of racist comments about certain races which I found not to my liking but when it came down to the Nig*er word he made all sorts of sneaky little ways of people not using it which I thought was quite weak because when you down other races and leave your own out it makes you look weak. I really expected something better something more gripping but if you got nothing to do on a Friday night go see Ice Age 2 if you have seen it I would tell you to go see inside man.,6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

The film tries many things, it wants to break some of the genre's traditional trademarks, putting across a social/cultural point or two along the way and It attempts to raise a complex scenario with a lot of nuanced ideas flowing around. But none of these efforts worked for me, I just found the characters and dialogues strange, not being able to fully grasp them.

rawked,"Second only to Tarantino, this is one of the best ""heist"" movies I've ever seen. Forget Clooney's Oceans crew, who are all about ""nudge nudge wink wink we're celebrities,"" and tune in to a movie where you don't know who's who or what's what until the end.Granted, I'm a big fan of Denzel Washington, and it's rare that he makes a misstep, but I'm always torn about Spike Lee. While Lee is inarguably a good filmmaker, his characters are often deliberately unlikeable, which makes an otherwise good movie uncomfortable to watch. While this movie's characters are generally unlikeable, the plot twists and turns more than make up for it. Clive Owen is slick and slimy as the main thief, and Jody Foster in an unusually glam role somehow manages to channel Helen Hunt. Foster is one of the best actresses working today, and has never been a glamourpuss, so to see her flip her ponytail and stalk around on four-inch pumps is surreal. The funniest moment was Clive Owen's interaction with the lone child, who shows him a violent video game, then tells Owen he'd get mad points for robbing the bank.

Tense and very entertaining,"A heist-film that will keep you on the edge of your seat from the word go. The main issue here is not how they perform the robbery, but a big WHY? Problem is: what do the bank robbers want? And why do they seem to be one step ahead of the police every time? They seem to know the police ""procedure book"" inside out.The ever reliable Denzel Washington gives another great performance as detective Frasier, a police negotiator, who is called in when the Bank of Manhattan is being robbed by a mysterious gang headed by a certain Russell Dalton (Clive Owen). Dozens of customers are held hostage, but they don't just seem to be after the money.We got the action, great performances and Spike Lee shows his directing skills but the main problem lies within the script, which obviously could have used some work. Christopher Plummer and Jodie Foster give way better performances then their thinly sketched characters deserve, but essentially the tension revolves around the two main characters, Frasier en Dalton. Film is about imagination and normally I do not care about issues concerning with probability or reality, but the plot is incredibly far-fetched at times and the conclusion was somewhat of a mystery to me, but these loopholes were cleverly filled by Clive Owen's introductionary words in order to add something to the mystery.The film kept my interest till the very end, but when the film was over, it was over. My mind was blank, no resonance whatsoever. I know it's an action/heist picture, but to me it seemed to pretend something more than that. Spike Lee knows how to build up tension scene for scene but as a whole, it didn't really hold up. Writing this comment, I can barely remember what I just saw. Probably, the script was fixed so many times in order to meet the demands of an ever-changing all-star cast and a director that wasn't first choice, that it went a little overboard.It's hardly a typical Spike Lee film. Pure genre work, let's be honest, but apparently other directors like Ron Howard pulled out, so perhaps this explains the troubled script procedures but these are small pickings and are easily outdone by a first-rate cast and Lee's directing skills.Solid entertainment.Camera Obscura --- 8/10",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

The movie keeps you wondering (something Hollywood seems to have forgotten makes a movie enjoyable) what's really going on.

Both Clive Owen and Denzel Washington give great performances. I'm not going to say anything about the story itself, go see it. It's definitely worth it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The perfect heist.  But the perfect heist movie?,"I've read a few reviews and general opinions on Inside Man, and it would appear that most people don't get the film, or at least they don't get it the way I did. The general consensus seems to be that Spike Lee has crafted an entertaining but flawed heist movie. But to me, that's all wrong. Spike Lee, to my eyes, has thrown the usual concept of building up detailed backgrounds on both the cops and the robbers, and instead has written an essay on the perfect bank robbery.The movie opens with Clive Owen's Dalton Russell giving a soliloquy from what appears to be a very small room. But as we find out, ""there is a vast difference from being stuck in a tiny cell and being in prison."" This monologue turns out to be the key to the whole film. Russell tells us that he has, in the events about to fold out on screen, planned and executed the perfect bank robbery. Why? Because he can. ""And therein, as the bard tells us, lies the rub."" The rest of the film follows both Russell and hostage negotiator Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) as they play in a battle of wits, where the prize is, seemingly, the lives of the hostages. Other characters come into the fray: Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer), the bank owner who's past (most people would have you believe) is integral to the heist; John Darius (Willem Dafoe), in an understated role as the officer in charge of proceedings; and Madeline White (Jodie Foster), an enigmatic business woman who's role is never explained, and doesn't need to be. The robbery itself includes such eccentricities as dressing up all the hostages in the exact same outfits the robbers are wearing (making the planning of a raid later on in the film rather difficult for the police) and broadcasting an Albanian president's public address when the police try to bug the bank.But all these little details do is disguise the robbery's true purpose: to be the perfect bank robbery. This fact was most evident, for me, in the film's music (by Terence Blanchard). Most of the time it's reminiscent of a Seventies' cop show, orchestral mixed with guitar riffs. But there are times when the music will swell, and the audience is confused as to what the meaning of this is. To my ears, it all became clear when we are shown a shot of Owen standing in the door of one of the bank's vaults. The music swells to almost epic proportions, and we are unconsciously told that there is something more than money going on.I won't go any further into the inner workings of the film, for fear of spoiling it for you. Safe to say that there are a few more surprises other than the ones listed above, and Spike Lee, it would seem, couldn't help sliding in some social commentary; at one point a Sikh argues with police that he is not an Arab, after they remove his turban for ""safety"".The film, of course, is not without its flaws. The ending is a little too drawn out, as it tries to wrap up story arcs that could have been left loose and still given the film a satisfying conclusion. But overall, Inside Man is one of the better heist movies I've seen (not that I've seen a whole lot; they're not really my thing). You might not interpret it as I did, but you'll still have fun.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Go see it people, it's worth watching","So, after having a nice dinner and drinks with some dear friends, that night, we decided to watch a movie since we're close, and by mistake, we chose Inside Man. Of course, I had no doubts that I would enjoy this movie since I'm a big fan of Denzel, and I wouldn't have any problem staying awake after 2:00am to enjoy a movie which will end at 4:30am.What I would like to say, that this movie is grade A. Well directed by the marvelous Spike Lee. Nice shooting, beautiful performance by every one, smart sarcasm, light sense of humor and above all, amazing script.You can watch a lot of bank robbery movies, but the way the movie starts, with a bunch of painters getting inside the bank, just simply take over and hold hostages and then dress them all the same; that wasn't something you see every day. Then, the purpose of the robbery, wasn't clear until the end of the movie, which made it even better.What gave it the better taste, when finally the swat team decided to break in and take hold of the situation, so every one gets out all dressed up the same, you can't tell the difference of who is who, that was one nice trick, even the hostages them selves couldn't identify or even notice. Of course, not to mention the ending, when we see Clive Owen coming out from the bank a week after with all the diamonds in his bag, that was one big scene that changed everything about this movie.I would give 10/10 for the performance of Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Chiwetel Ejiofor.Go see it guys, it's worth watching.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Good, but couldn't get into it!","Maybe I was expecting too much. But of course Denzel was great, as was Clive Owen. Great cast, but just didn't grab me like i thought it would. It was very confusing somewhat, determining just who were the so called bad guys, and who were the good guys. I will agree it was a good movie.....just not great. To me the movie dragged, I was hoping more would happened, and when the ending came, I was dumbfounded. Some parts I agree were cool, the acting was great, but not powerful. Some people compared it to ""Dog Day Afternoon"", I disagree. I know others will think to themselves, What movie was I watching?, but this is how i felt. Maybe if I watch it again, I will feel differently. But truly it did fall short of my expectations.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The brilliance of a bank-rob movie :),"Last night, I was going to the cinema, with my best friend. We go once a week. I was late from work, so I rushed at his house, and we we're nearly to late..Just in time we were about to see on of the best movies, where Denzel Washington occurs in! And one of the best movies for 2 years.The story tells about a bank being robbed, in a really unique way. The tools they use, and the way how they confuse the outside world is brilliant! Also the plot is very sweet. You have no clue where the movie is going and what is about to happen to the bank robbers. It is a movie with an end you hardly can't expect. It is different of all others movies with such a plot.Very good acting by Denzel Washington. But maybe even better by Clive Owen. He makes a stunning acting performance in this movie. Definitely worth to look even if you don't like these kind of movies. In my opinion it's even worth a top 250 all time movie!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Superb!,"If you like ""Ocean's Eleven"" or ""Italian Job"", that can be your new favorite film. I like it because I like smart robbery films. Clive Owen was shining despite the mask that he was wearing during the film. In addition, film includes lots of political message but it doesn't disturb you. The story is very well and the musics are unbelievable! The music which plays at the beginning of the film shows you what kind of a film you will watch. There is not very much action so do not expect to see super visual effects etc. There are many other action movies if you are a fan of action films.

"Compelling, Quality Film-making (CAUTION- spoiler within)","All in all great film. Spike Lee navigates the waters of mainstream film-making and unique, quirky, innovative scripts with great ease. Perhaps the most smooth, enjoyable, thought-provoking, flawless Lee film I've yet seen. Jodie Foster is a stand-out. Only two slight flaws: (WARNING: SPOILER AHEAD)1) Clive Owen's accent- woh there boy- are you American or British or Australian? Choose your nationality and stick with it- highly distracting. Not a sign of good acting here.2) If Case was so ashamed of his dark past, why did he keep the HIGHLY INCRIMINATING paper document in the safety deposit box? Why didn't he just destroy it and keep the diamonds? It makes no sense.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Different kind of Bank robbery film,"Went to see the preview of this bank robbery film, expecting to see just another in a line up of bank robbery film, but was pleasantly surprised at the twists and turns of this movie. Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors and was not expecting to much. Well I was pleasantly surprised at the story with it's unexpected surprises. I thought that Jodie Foster was wasted in her part, but that Clive Owen was very good in his part as the bank robber leader. The only objection I found was that the run time for the movie was a little long, but other than that I did enjoy the movie very much, and I recommend this movie for those that like a good story, with a little to much sitting time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Great Dialogue with Witty Lines. I liked it,I watched this in 2024 and I must say it is better than a lot of the current movies that I have watches. For starters most of the actors really fit the role and did a great job. The dialogue on the movie is top notch with witty lines. Shows the workmanship. The writer put in some thought towards writing this.It is a movie I would recommend to people who like movies with minimal unrealistic scenes. The scene is based on just two locations but the movie is captivating enough you will not notice the limitation.The story line flows and the narration at least to some degree can be matched up to reality.I can see inspiration to the TV Series Money Heist.,7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Mama Like,"I tried not to read too much about this film (in relation to Dog Day Afternoon) and I don't usually pay full price for films; however, I was inclined to take the plunge on the basis of combination of casting, the director and the storyline.

The script is cleverly written and the dialog just plain fun, but you have to listen closely.I've been a Washington fan for some time and for the past 5 or so years haven't missed a Clive Owen film to-date. Owen's professional choices in roles just get better and better with each role. Jody Foster is right on the mark. If I'm not mistaken, there is one or two cast members from Dog Day Afternoon in this film as well. You'll just have to try and find them.I would strongly consider purchasing this film on DVD for my collection when it is released.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The Insider,"Two overworked New York detectives try to uncover why four bank robbers who have taken hostages appear to be stalling for time in this unusual heist movie directed by Spike Lee. The amount of thought and detail in the robbers' plan is a constant source of fascination and the film derives a lot of mileage from how the detectives always find themselves one step behind. The mystery at the heart of the film (why they are stalling and what they are really after) is pretty decent too, even if all the cutaways to Christopher Plummer as the owner of the bank spell things out a bit. The film tries to do a bit too much that is daringly different for its own good though. The flashforwards as hostages are interviewed afterwards, for instance, are intriguing but also subtract from the intimacy of the action. They prematurely reveal who survives too. The subplot with Jodie Foster is likewise a mixed blessing. She is easily the most interesting and mysterious character in the piece, however, as the film is primarily about the two detectives and the bank robbers interacting, she likewise breaks some of the tension. Even if is not always edge-of-the-seat gripping though, 'Inside Man' is a film with very few (if any) dull moments. Matthew Libatique (the Oscar nominated DOP of 'Black Swan') does a great job visualising the material together with Lee. From the dark lighting choices, to a vertigo shot on Plummer at his desk, to a tracking shot from Denzel Washington's chest, the film looks great. Terence Blanchard ('25th Hour') also provides another solid music score for Lee.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Gripping Tale Of Corporate & Political Games ‚ô¶ 80%,"I had huge expectations from the story. As a matter of fact, the plot gives something for me to chew on. Only, I chewed and chewed and chewed, only to spit it in a ravine.Clive Owen is fantastic. But I loved Denzel Wahsington's charismatic performance as a detective. He steals the limelight for sure. His character scores massive points, but Owen's character's got depth and anonymity. Jodie Foster has the cleverest dialogs while Christopher Plummer was a disgrace (I don't know.. either his character or portrayal - something went nasty). The makers have made it a point to keep the viewers hooked to what they are showing on the screen with witty dialogs, humor, action & serious plot. Indeed, more than meeting my expectations... it surprised.The opening song surprised me. Well, being an Indian, it was a matter of pride. Although, I should reprimand the selection of that particular song; was an inept thing to do for a crime thriller like this. Yes, it involves great thinking to churn out what is happening on screen, but as it enhances... the plot gets even more confusing. That troubled me. Lots of implications & unanswered questions plastered over heavy political jargon... well, it is too cryptic. Although, on a second watch, everything got clear. 8.0/10.Mighty thinking of changing the idea of the whole bank-robbery thing. Quite an intuitive take. Appreciate the makers for giving something different on that!BOTTOM LINE: Falls short of credibility, otherwise Inside Man is pumping, thrilling & food for thought.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

I love a good heist,"This film caught my attention with its opening - somewhat mysterious and edgy music. I enjoy a heist movie so when I cottoned on its genre, I was hooked.The story becomes increasingly intriguing as it unfolds - it is clever and well thought out. However, I found that I did became slightly confused towards the latter part of the film with the intricacies of the plot requiring increasing concentration and I was a little frustrated that I had to work at staying in the loop.In the end I came away with a lot of questions, some that could be answered, others which could not. Nevertheless, it was a good movie. I gave it a 7.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
An Entertaining Lark,"If you're a fan of Spike Lee (and I most assuredly am since I was one of the twenty people who actually saw his last film, ""She Hate Me""), there's a certain smug satisfaction in watching his latest ""joint"", ""Inside Man."" Spike Lee has never been a populist entertainer. His movies are almost always overtly talky, political, and married to New York City (I would even go so far as to call him the black Woody Allen). He has as many detractors and he does fans. There have been a few occasions where he's sidestepped to different types of stories (that were still very urban and very New York), fantastically disastrously with ""Summer of Sam"" and surprisingly deep with his superb ""25th Hour."" Here, hooking up with long-time collaborator Denzel Washington (who gives a cracker-jack performance as a slick hostage negotiator), Lee gives us his first flick of pure entertainment, and it's the kind of twisty, thrilling lark you would normally get from a latter day Hitchcock or a David Mamet at the top of his game.Like all great director's directors, Spike Lee, taking a que from Scorcese, picks a stale genre (the heist flick) and infuses it with his New York flair and socially conscious commentary. Sure, this is a film about the perfect crime (where robbing a bank is a cover for a much larger plot), but it also has the typical Spike Lee nods to society, race, and class struggles. There's plenty to delight in here, from Lee's self assured direction, to Denzel's perfect line delivery, to Clive Owen's oh-so-smooth performance as the heist-master extraordinaire, to Jodie Foster's atypical and surprisingly sexy turn as a consultant brought on the scene by the big-wigs to get things done. Foster, who has made a nice little niche as the prototypical ""powerful mother in crisis,"" in films like ""Panic Room"" and ""Flight Plan"" is perfectly channeled here by Lee to turn her typical iciness into cool seduction, and who knew she had such great legs!? Leave it if Lee to channel the sexiness of everyday women. Take for instance the closing shot of Denzel's girlfriend lying in bed in her negligee twirling his hat with her feet. It's the type of classy, jazzy riff on sensuality and showmanship Lee revels in when he's not mad at the world. It's a perfect ending to ""Inside Man"" and a reminder to the audience: sure, there may have been plot holes you could drive a swat team through, but who cares as long as you were entertained.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Smooth, Well-done, and Fun......","....this is 2 hours of smart movie-making. Denzel, Jodie, and Clive breeze thru their roles perfectly, and they are having fun while they do it. Denzel Washington makes acting look effortless. Clive Owen is definitely an actor to keep your eye on (too bad he is not the new James Bond). Jodie Foster is comfortable in her role as a ""bad person"", but one cannot help but like her deviant character. She is at her sexiest ever. Spike Lee's direction is slick and compelling (although some people do not like the jarring camera movements at times), so it is nice ""eye candy"" as well. The story is good enough to keep you interested and wanting more. A couple of clever twists, and a plausible story-line make the film believable enough. The audience at my theater were all having a good time, laughing out loud every few minutes at intelligent sexual innuendo and great characters delivering those lines and more.

"Mega star power add up to an enjoyable, above-average but not particularly remarkable movie","""Inside man"" is the sort of movie that you can't really talk about meaningfully without invoking spoilers of one sort of another. I'll try, but be duly warned.Right at the beginning, the audience is given a teaser when planner of a ""perfect bank robbery"" Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) stares you right in the eye and articulates, ""Pay strict attention to what I say because I choose my words carefully and never repeat myself"". But he does, repeat himself, at the end of the movie. Well, maybe not technically because it's just running the same monologue, but by that time, it means a lot more. So, do pay attention to what you see and hear, to everything actually, including the title of the movie. It's an interesting guessing game, not particularly brilliant, but interesting nonetheless.The set up is very well done. Once the robbers get control of the bank and get the 50 hostages to don the outfit and masks they themselves are wearing, things start to get rolling. The arrival of the law enforcers is quite exciting, but almost like a police procedural, including details of how the area is sealed off. All this is exciting because it's done with quick cuttings and an agile camera. But there's also a long, continuous penning single take that follows the three key law men from the police vehicle all the way to the door of the bank ¬ñ detectives Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) and Bill Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and captain Darius (Willem Defoe). While on the camera, there's also the use of conspicuously differentiated tone and focus to denote a series of scenes taking place in a different time dimension (which the audience should be able to catch on soon enough).One of the key attractions of this genre is pitching two adversaries against each other. Immediately coming to mind is Kevin Spacey and Samuel L. Jackson in ""The negotiator"". ""Inside man"" is less intriguing, but with Owen and Washington, you're guaranteed to get the most out of a somewhat standard police-criminal cat-and-mouse game. Added to that are bank chairman (Christopher Plummer) and high-power ""fixer"" Madeliene White (Jodie Foster) he hires to recover something from a deposit box in the bank currently under the robbers' control. With such a mega-power cast, the permutation of head-on scenes alone is worth the admission: Washington-Foster, Owen-Foster, Foster-Plummer, Washington-Plummer. Poor Defoe, who can carry a movie all by himself, gets only a clich√© role and a quick exchange with Washington.As to the story itself, the way things unfold is on the whole satisfactory, although plot holes are almost inevitable. Loose threads are generally tied together coherently in the end. Not a devilishly clever plot but look at it this way: the fun is not so much in arriving at the destination as in the process of getting there, particularly with some great acting along the way.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Solid heist thriller that drags on a bit too long,"Solid heist thriller that puts a new spin on the familiar tale and does it very well. The first two thirds or so of the movie are fantastic, with the entire bank robbery very gripping and suspenseful. Unfortunately, the plot gets tangled up in motivations and the film spirals downward a bit near the end. Perhaps a bit overlong, but the real problem is overwriting - an entire subplot could have been scrapped with only a positive effect on the film. Still, it's a great flick, chocked full of humour, intelligence, and interesting characters.The thing that separated this a bit from other heist thrillers was the Jodie Foster character, who was unfortunately underdeveloped and a bit of a waste. Her entire subplot with the Christopher Plummer character really seems out of place and poorly managed, and could have been much better had it been more properly woven into the story. The ending, which focuses primarily on this subplot, loses a lot of the momentum built up during the first two thirds, and just feels extraneous and drags the film on longer than it needed to be. That's my only large complaint; the rest of the film, by and large, is fantastic.The performances really stand out, and seeing Clive Owen and Denzel Washington going mano a mano is a real treat. Both of them are excellent, and it's hard to pick a favourite of the two. Foster is good, but her character is not really interesting. Plummer is decent but unneeded, and both Dafoe and Washington's partner are quite good. The direction is solid, with several scenes really standing out, although the entire robbery sequence is shot extraordinarily well. The cutting back and forth between the standoff and the later interviews with the hostages is interesting, and makes for a more compelling story. The final twist is quite original and intriguing, though logic is stretched a bit to make it work. Still, overall, a solid film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Spike Lee strikes again,"The quality of the writing saves this from being another good film ruined by the untalented Spike Lee. He does manage to get a few of his idiotic signatures into the film: the shot of the dim bulb future brother in law passed out and gripping a 40 of ""tha bomb"" malt liquor with the bomb fin cap in place, and a scene in which a central character takes a bumpy ride toward the camera on a wheeled platform with a constipated look on his face.There are also a few ridiculous shots of cops holding their rifles in freehand aim on the bank for minutes on end for no reason. Try holding a rifle on a target freehand with no rest for the weight of the weapon for several minutes and you'll see what makes these shots ridiculous.This is a good film despite the fact that there's a talentless midget directing. If Lee had managed to ruin this film, the title of this review would have been ""Spike Lee strikes (out) again.Even Spike couldn't ruin this great story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"enjoy the cool, smooth ride.","""Inside Man"" stars Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, and Jodie Foster ¬ñ all bringing their A-games and mustering up all the movie star fire power they can. They are joined in able support by Chiwetel Ejiofor and Christopher Plummer, consecutively one of my favorite young actors and one of my favorite old-schoolers. Director Spike Lee has ventured outside of his familiar and crafted a very interesting and entertaining bank heist/perfect crime caper. But there's a lot more going on here than the meets the eye. With a deft screenplay by newcomer Russell Gewirtz, Lee delivers a crackerjack action drama that also serves as a gentle treatise on how we treat each other in this country. As a plus, Spike sells this message subtly this time out and not in the usual ham-fisted style that he has employed in the past.The film begins with a tight medium full on the mug of Owen, explaining that he is Dalton Russell and hinting that things are not always as they seem. This monologue segues into a sight of four people dressed as painters entering the lobby of Manhattan Trust, a Wall Street branch of a worldwide financial institution. (Think Citibank/Citigroup with charitable do-gooder Chairman Plummer as a Sanford Weill wannabe.) The robbery is underway, hostages are taken and the crime becomes a highly scrutinized red-ball media event that drags on for the better part of a day. The bank robbers seem to stay one step ahead of the police department at every turn, but what exactly is going on here? Washington plays NYPD hostage negotiator Detective Keith Frazier. He heads the operation to make contact with ringleader Russell and insure the safety of the hostages. Frazier is newly promoted and somewhat immersed in a corruption scandal. He sees the siege as an opportunity to prove his worth, make the grade and clear his name all at the same time. Two-time Oscar winner Washington gives yet another unimpeachable portrayal that does not disappoint. (Has this man ever given a poor performance?) His Frazier is charming, stalwart and quite droll. His presentation of this man in above his head is never stronger than when he has absolutely no idea what to expect next. Washington can always cut the dashing figure, but his best work occurs when he is brought low and his characters are forced to rely on something besides their physicality and allure. As expected, he serves as the principled center to this labyrinthine tale of greed, morals and corruption. Washington's work here continues his celebrated successful collaborative relationship with Lee.Casting Clive Owen as Washington's adversary was a sharp and necessary move. It takes an actor of serious fortitude, appeal and strong sense of self to stand toe to toe with Washington and not crumble in Denzel's wake. As the mastermind behind the break-in, the winning Brit more than holds his own in scenes with Washington and Foster, who plays mysterious power broker Madeline White. There is an intelligence and determination behind those icy blue eyes of steel. He's an enigma, a genius criminal literally sitting on top of a pile of money that's his for the taking, but with no clear exit strategy. It is a masterful confluence of direction, writing and acting and the audience is rewarded with a modern deluxe throwback to the golden era of Sidney Lumet movies. You get the sense that everyone involved couldn't wait to show up for work, tell this story and create these scenes together., Jodie Foster makes another appearance as a supporting character. She is quite compelling as White, a Machiavellian fixer with seemingly no humanity inside herself whatsoever. As she clomps around Manhattan in designer shoes that seem entirely too high and uncomfortable for her (), she exudes authority and avarice. And it's a delightful irony as she is decidedly so much physically smaller than all the big studs around her. There are a couple of chilling scenes with Plummer where's she appears to have ice in her veins. She's not alone though, every character has their own secrets and agenda and it's simply a matter of waiting to see what happens when irresistible forces collide with immovable objects.Spike applies his singular vision throughout the film and never at the sake of his audience's enjoyment. He says what he wants to say about race, religion, money, history and morality in this country, but this time without the screaming. There is the expected marvelous camera-work and clever imagery which as always in the case of a Spike Lee Joint, is accompanied by the plaintive wails of a standard yet sublime score by Terence Blanchard. There is a scene where Washington and Ejiofor turn a corner in a hallway and advance upon the camera at a brisk walking pace. Lee photographs these stunning examples of Beautiful Black Men so lovingly and at such an angle it gives one pause and truly takes the breath away. And Lee knows how to film New York City in such a way that the metropolis itself actually becomes a character in the film.It is by no means a perfect film but it is highly entertaining and worthwhile. The narrative still does come across a bit murky in the third act and there are some lags in action, but these are minor complaints. Go see ""Inside Man"" for the performances, the script, and the opportunity to see a seasoned vanguard director stretch his wings within an entirely different form. Welcome to the mainstream Spike",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Breath of Fresh Air,"Some may have thought that the bank heist bit had been done to death in movies, and that originality in this plot line was near impossible to attain. Along comes Spike Lee, blasting that thought out the window and dominating the box office with the tricky, slick and highly original ""Inside Man"".Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) introduces himself to the audience, instructing us to ""pay strict attention"", as he proceeds to reveal himself as a bank robber. Cut to the scene of the crime; a New York City bank being robbed by men decked out in paint-gear. With 50 hostages who have been forced to strip down to their underwear and don the exact same outfits, masks and all, as the criminals; hostage negotiators Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) and Bill Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor) are called in. The bank's owner, Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer) is also very concerned about the heist, but for all the wrong reasons. Mr. Case has something very valuable and very personal in safety deposit box 329 that he does not want anyone seeing. In comes the ambiguous character, Madeline White (Jodie Foster) whose job, it seems, is to do favors for very rich clients. Using the connections she has built up in her unsavory business, White calls in a favor from the Mayor who gives her clearance at the crime scene to be privy to everything that Frazier is privy to ¬ñ that way she can make sure that the contents of her clients deposit box remains a mystery. Now it is a race as Frazier tries to figure out what Dalton wants; surely a mastermind who has planned the seemingly perfect crime down to the finest details isn't stupid enough to think that he can demand a jet and make a clean getaway ¬ñ he has other motives, but what? Punctuated throughout the film are interviews Frazier and Mitchell conduct after the robbery¬ñ interviews of the hostages (and unbeknownst to them, the crooks as well) as they try to figure out who the good and bad guys are; a difficult task since nobody ever saw their faces and everyone, even the hostages were dressed just like the crooks.""Inside Man"" is a fantastic film that doesn't treat its audience like dopey fifth graders. It is slow to unravel in the beginning, as the players are introduced and the robbery conducted; but throughout the film clues are scattered for the audience to discover and later examine as the plot slowly but surely unravels. Serious props have to go towards first time movie writer Russell Gewirtz for coming up with this ingenious script, with fresh twists and jazzy characters. I look forward to tracking this guy's sure to be budding career.The script really is amazing and beautifully executed by a fairly haphazard but all the same, stellar cast. Denzel Washington plays the part of old Hollywood style smart cop, cracking some great one-liners throughout. Jodie Foster, while playing a fairly restricted and vague character, still manages to deliver a captivating and dominating performance; but really, that shouldn't come as a surprise. Clive Owen who has played the bad guy before in films like 'Closer' proves himself yet again as a phenomenal leading man; believable both as a brains and bad-ass. Willem Dafoe also has a small part as the S.W.A.T captain.One complaint is that the film is very long, with a 129 minute run-time. It becomes a little exhausting towards the end, after the slow-burning build-up to the bank robbery, all the clues are revealed in the last 45 minutes and you need to reel in your concentration. From what I have read on these boards, and walking out of the cinema; some people were a little iffy about the end and thought there were quite a few plot-holes. I personally wasn't left with any questions or complaints; I thought the film tied up very nicely. I put that down to the fact that ALL of the burning questions were answered in the last 45 minutes and it can be a little tough to be inundated with information; piecing together the puzzle while also trying to remember exactly what the puzzle was.""Inside Man"" is a very satisfying criminal drama/mystery ¬ñ and a breath of fresh air in a year that has seen 'Big Mommas House 2' and 'The Pink Panther' in the number one spot at the box office.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

""DDA"" featured a brilliant and mesmerizing performance by Al Pacino as the bank robber. ""Inside Man"" focuses less on the bank robber played by a mostly covered up Clive Owen, and more on the negotiator played by Denzel Washington.Although we see little of Clive's face (other than the opening and closing segment) he does a nice job of playing the cool as a cucumber thief with mostly his voice. Denzel plays the slightly erratic, career on the line cop, whose skills few have confidence in. Add to the mix an egotistical, intellectual mercenary played by Jodie Foster (who gets to flash her near perfect 43 year old legs), and a powerful Bank Chairman played by Christopher Plummer and director Spike Lee has quite a loaded gun with which to play.Overall the bank heist and hostage stuff is thrilling and full of suspense. The film loses a bit with the whole Christopher Plummer storyline that is really kind of hard to believe. Also, the obvious Spike Lee moments will make you cringe, but he still has a great eye for the city. The song that plays over the opening and closing credits is amazing, but most of the film score is flawed. Due to the painters uniforms and masks, very few in the supporting cast stand out, but as you can guess, Denzel is fine carrying the star power load.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
One Big Waste of Time,"This will be the first movie I've reviewed. I was driven to it by this horrible movie I just watched. At the end I just sat there wondering what I'd just seen and why. I have no clue what it was trying to convey or where it was supposed to be going, but in my view it never got there. The worst of it was the plot, which was plodding and tiresome. This was followed closely by a fair acting job by Denzel Washington (who is one of my favorites) and terrible acting by everyone else, particularly Jodie Foster. Her portrayal of her character was just too cutesy and I found it annoying. I believed all the hype over this movie and ended up wasting 2 hrs. of my life that I will never get back!!

"Brilliant, brilliant movie","Unlike the trailer to this brilliant, brilliant movie I'm not going to ruin a thing by giving any spoilers. Instead I will just say what a fantastic movie this is! The story is gripping from start to finish, the acting top notch and Spike Lee's direction is a pleasure to watch. This film is a wake up call, showing that every film doesn't have to look and feel identical.Perhaps the best thing that can be said about this movie is that there is not one single clich√© in the whole movie. Characters never say or do anything that they would in every other movie made in the last ten years. So many times in modern cinema, if they were to pause the scene you could finish the end of the character's sentence or complete the ending. The dialogue rings true in every instance and the plot and characters are both highly intelligent and compulsively interesting.This movie is a ride that you don't get off until you're fumbling for your car keys, replaying the plot in your head. I found myself giggling with delight as I watched the story unfold with so much expertise that it made me ask why the hell can't there be more movies like this? Spike Lee has made films of this quality before but never with so much pure enjoyment to be had. This movie shames every other movie made in the last few years and is the sort of movie that should be winning all the Oscars. It's original, smart and doesn't take ANY cheap tricks which spoil most movies.While I've seen some other good movies in the last year or two, this is the first film where I've walked out of the cinema wanting to walk straight back in.

An amazing heist flick from Spike,"Spike Lee's heist flick involving a cop (Washington) who tries to talk down a bank robber after the criminal's perfect heist takes a turn in the wrong direction. Lee's film is directed perfectly, i mean i couldn't tell where he was going, it was very professionally done film, very visually convincing and nothing too fancy but the camera-work was just flashy enough for this kind of movie. I liked this film a lot, maybe its because im just a sucker for heist flicks. Clive Owen was very good as one of the bank robbers and Jodie Foster was also not bad in her role, though i thought she was a bit underused and her role was hardly significant, perhaps partially due to the writing, partially due to the way she performed it. This film was still very good however, a great cast, solid screenplay and good direction from Lee. Spike Lee shows his versatility here as he has perfected several genres with this project. A must-see for heist flick enthusiasts or any fan of Spike Lee or Denzel or even Clive Owen. --IMDB Rating: 7.6, my rating: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

A Rollicking NYC Roller Coaster Ride that Is the Triumph of Brain Over Brawn in a Heist Film,"""Inside Man"" is terrific thriller, teasing us constantly as it deliciously delivers brains over brawn. Reveling in its very NYC atmosphere, it has much of the grittiness of ""Dog Day Afternoon"" crossed with the clever suspense of ""The Usual Suspects"".Following Clive Owen's arresting monologue to the audience that alerts us to pay attention to the clues (""I'm only going to say this once"" - though that's repeated at the end after we are realizing what he really meant), the opening scenes set up that director Spike Lee is for the first time using the clashing, unmelted pot of NYC's divergent races and immigrants not as a hortatory end in itself but to heighten and color what could have been just another perfect crime heist movie.Reversing the trek of ""The Warriors"", we are immediately on a relentlessly purposeful tour of the length of Brooklyn from Coney Island through its diverse ethnic neighborhoods representing the corners of the globe to the gargoyles of Wall Street, the center of the world's financial power, all to the rollicking beat of a symbolic ""Bollywood Joint"" featuring Panjabi MC, a leader in the bhangra blend of dance and Indian diaspora pop music.When we are first introduced to various ethnic types among the cops and the bank customers I was afraid that Lee was doing his broad brush stereotypes again as he did to nasty effect in ""Summer of Sam"", but instead it's all slyly setting up the red herrings, cul-de-sacs and final outcome in Russell Gewirtz's roller coaster ride of a debut feature script. Some of the best dialog is in pointed exchange of raw identities that almost trump the main action, whether an Albanian or Sikh or Armenian or Jewish grandmother or racist officer or sexist punk or rich WASP Park Avenue CEO, plus we see NYC's rainbows of Asians, Latinos, workers and politicians, old and young. Many of the lines are laugh out loud funny and marvelously ironic.Owen plays on the cold bad Brit stereotype we've seen from Alan Rickman in ""Die Hard"" to Paul Bettany in ""Firewall"" before doing his version of the right thing while the smart alecky boy amusingly recalls the fresh kid inevitably nicknamed Brooklyn who is in every World War II movie troupe, as he shocks the bank robber with his violent and racist video game (played while they're sitting in the bank vault). Everybody has prejudices or pre-suppositions or a deal to make that are confused by the robbers' physical and strategic masks (coincidentally recalling the symbolic use of the Guy Fawkes' masks in ""V for Vendetta"") and cleverly edited shuffling of positions.The flash forward interrogations of the hostages by a wily Denzel Washington -- who is just plain enjoying the tripping on his tongue of sharp dialog more than he had in his several other detective roles-- are jarringly integrated in with a grainy look throughout to give us revelatory clues about what is really going on to emphasize that we can't assume anything about anyone we see even when he seems just too suspicious. This is a constantly keep 'em guessing story with visual bread crumbs dribbled out for us to follow.It's nice to see Jodie Foster play a tough broad who is a talker not an action hero, even if her smarmy fixer doesn't make 100% sense in the plot, though her nefarious negotiating in front of a flag tribute to 9/11 is a chuckle about the American Way.Christopher Plummer is repeating an elegantly corrupt type we've seen him do many times, most recently in ""Syriana"", and his explication was a bit too conveniently delivered for the story. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Washington's partner and Willem Dafoe as the technocrat are underused throughout in restrained roles. While I appreciate that Washington's sexy girlfriend is given a career as a fellow cop, which is unusual for this genre, I was disappointed that she seems to be half his age. It was nice to see the usually comic Daryl ""Chill"" Mitchell in a small serious appearance.The production design details of NYC accuracy are an utter delight, from real TV stations to the authentic feel of NYPD's handling of emergencies to the current Mayor's bull pen office at City Hall plus script references to real people in sports and government. Even the sound design reinforces the realistically gripping experience.Terence Blanchard's score is much less jazzy than his other works for Lee's films and matches the action and human variety we see on the screen.The gang's calling themselves variations of ""Steve"" seems like an amusing crossing of Howard Hawks with Quentin Tarantino.The closing credits are generous in giving full attention to the very large ensemble by letting us match their personas to the actors.While the violence is more implied than real, but still scary, the dialog is full of rampant, explicit profanity so I was surprised that folks brought very young children to a matin√©e.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Check on Chaiyya Chaiyya and listen to the awesome track. AR Rahman and Gulzar (composer and poet respectively) are geniuses - par excellence.

The character of a Sikh (one of the turban wearing, bearded Indian males)has some of the extremely delicious lines for the US security agencies and their workers. Jodi Foster sparkles in the role of the ""deal maker"", she carries herself well as a body part as the mayor prefers to personify her general character. All the pieces fit well, and therefore results into a satisfying story telling for the likes of Spike Lee, Jodi Foster and Clive Owen (whose face is visible for a very little time).

Pretty good caper from Spike Lee,"Lee is a very uneven filmmaker. Some of his movies, like ""Do the Right Thing"" and ""Malcolm X"", are brilliant. Others are pretty junky. This movie is a departure from any movie I've ever seen him do, in that it's pretty much a straight caper film, and even though there are a lot of twists, it's not overly about politics, the African American Experience, or sociology.What I liked about it: - The theme music. I don't know much about popular Indian Music, but I liked the hip-hop inspired Indian song in the beginning. I'm not entirely sure what it was doing in this film, but I liked it.The Actors: Foster, Davis, Plummer, Washington - all great performances. the supporting actors were great too.The twists: I honestly didn't see what was coming until the end. I knew something was going on funny, but I didn't see it coming. Some people might not like the non-linear story telling, but it held my interest Things I didn't like: - Ultimately they didn't develop the central idea of the story too much. I don't want to give it away, but they should have played up the Plummer story more.The ending was a bit too clever.Overall, a pretty enjoyable film, and a good step forward for Lee.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Overrated!,"The day I saw the trailer for the latest ""Equaliser"" installment, I thought about watching some Denzel movies because there are so many I have yet to see, so I searched the internet, scoured through his entire filmography, and found out about this movie, and I came to realise this is rated as one of his most popular and highly celebrated works, and that obviously piqued my interest.I had no idea I'd leave with nothing but disappointment.This was the complete antithesis of what I had presumed: not enough thrill, insufficient writing, and, most importantly, the drama failed to settle in; in spite of a competent ensemble and a couple of memorable performances, it fell short of meeting its objectives.

Extremely Well Shot,"Admittedly, I walked into ""Inside Man"" with skepticism. I am no film buff; nevertheless, I was pleased with this movie.Something that jumps out from the screen is Spike Lee's talent. He shoots every single scene with a uniqueness that is rarely seen in this type of flick. The most natural movements performed by the actors are made special through Lee's eye for camera direction.On the note of the thespians, the acting in ""Inside Man"" was top notch. Although I often doubt the range of Clive Owen's acting, he was certainly made for this role. However, Jodie Foster seems miscast. Having been in countless films and earning her reputation as a good actress, her talent is underused. She is much more suitable to be a main character as she is too memorable to be a supporting character.One awkward problem in the movie is some of Lee's preachings that are fitted into this film. I do agree with much of what is said in the film such as violence being exposed to young children and also much of the racism that is still evolving in our community. However, at a moment or two, this heist flick seems to be preaching to the audience while the audience did not ask for it. Though, this is not too much of a turn off.What is remarkable about ""Inside Man"" is the startling human nature of the characters and plot. The classic merciless hostage situation is dodged. What makes sets this film apart from the average heist flick, without spoiling the movie, is pretty much summed up in Denzel Washington's eloquent words from the trailer, ""this ain't no bank robbery!""",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Simply Terrific,"At last. A movie to which I can give a 10. I haven't felt this enthusiastic about a film in many, many months, and I can't recall at all the last time I sat right through the credits so I could write down the name of the record company who are marketing the soundtrack. I was gripped from the entrancing opening shots of the city, to the intriguing and satisfying conclusion. I'm rather ashamed to admit that this is the first Spike Lee film I've ever seen, but if his others are anywhere near this good, then I shall make a point of looking them up. This movie has an interesting plot, very good acting and a fine script. Such standards should of course be common, but they're not. This is quite a rarity unfortunately. It's intelligent and very entertaining.The story is a variation on the well worn theme of the bank heist, but it becomes evident very quickly that this is not any ordinary bank heist, and we are not in for two hours of yawn-inducing clich√© and special effects. A gang takes over a bank, holding staff and customers hostage, then demands a plane to escape. But what are they really after? Are they simply stalling for time, does the bank founder have a nasty secret hidden in the vaults and between the police and the robbers, who is outwitting whom? It's more of a whydunnit than a whodunnit and it's closely plotted. The dialogue is crisp and real, managing to infuse occasional asides of humor into the characters' interactions, especially amongst the police. The movie is, of course, set in New York and Lee throws in many passing references to the city's varied ethnicities, who live uneasily cheek by jowl.The performances are outstanding; Denzel Washington, as the police negotiator, has never been better, and with this role Clive Owen, as the gang leader, has more than made up for the irritating prat he played in Closer. I have always loved Jodie Foster and she gives a perfect performance in a small but important role as a wealthy power broker. I can think of few other actresses who could pull off the subtle mix of elegance, sexuality and authority that she exudes here on screen. All the supporting performers are equally good too. Good stuff! Go see.Addendum: I went to see this again two weeks later. Even better second time around where I picked up many nuances in the major performances (Washington, Owen, Foster, Defoe) that escaped me first time around as I concentrated on the plot. I remain convinced this is one of the best movies in several months. One small criticism; some of the ""outdoor"" street scenes are quite badly lit and are quite obviously filmed under artificial light.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"""Inside Man"" is the best Spike Lee film in years","Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) is planning the perfect bank robbery. Dalton plans on robbing the Manhattan bank in New York City. When he goes to rob the bank, he has a building filled of hostages and his plan is set in action. Detective Keith Frazier is the cop in charge of this hostage situation and will stop at nothing to solve this case. As time goes on, Frazier knows that Dalton is not the typical bank robber but a man with a much larger plan.""Inside Man"" basically brings back Spike Lee to the directing circle. This film has gained the attention of critics and audiences alike and for once in many years I can honestly admit I like Spike Lee again. I guess this is the new thing in Hollywood; older directors who seemed to lose their touch come back with a big hit. Woody Allen did it with ""Match Point"", Ang Lee did it with ""Brokeback Mountain"", and now Spike Lee did it with ""Inside Man."" The great thing about ""Inside Man"" is the suspense that the film builds. As the film continues on you wonder how it's going to end. You have a feeling early on that it's not going to be a typical ending but a surprise ending. So as you sit there watching the film you begin trying to piece together the pieces of the puzzle and try to figure out what's going to happen in the end of the film.Another thing I liked about the film was that it wanted be a good bank robbery film like ""Dog Day Afternoon"". It wasn't as typical as most bank robbery or cop films are today. It played homage to the 70s and 80s when it came to bank robbery movies. The good thing about this film was that it wasn't overly predictable. It had some nice twists and had you guessing up until the end.Be warned that this movie does throw a lot at you. There are many characters that are very significant to the story but as time goes on you can have a hard time connecting them all together. At first after watching this film I was wondering what the hell happened but then on my drive home I was thinking about it and everything clicked. This is a movie that you have to pay attention for. It's not a brainless action film like Die Hard where you can shut your brain off and enjoy mindless entertainment. This movie actually has some substance to it.The acting all around is superb as you probably already guessed. Denzel Washington gives yet another fine performance that has a nice hint of humor to it. Clive Owen is great as the brilliant and cocky bank robbery. Jodie Foster plays a very good character here which is different than many roles I have seen her in. And finally Willem Dafoe is great as well. ""Inside Man"" has a great cast and each person involved does a great job playing their role.In Conclusion, ""Inside Man"" is finally a bank robber film for people who actually like to think when they go to the movies. The film provides excellent performances and a very interesting and creative script. As I watched the film I found myself wondering where the film was going. I also wondered what Dalton's alternative motive was. It's a good film that really shows off Spike Lee ability to direct good movies. I think this film is a reminder to Hollywood that every cop movie doesn't have to be so predictable and action packed. It's a good cop movie that is actually pretty original.MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Inside Man"" is a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Like no other bank robbery movie!,"A clever bank robbery which is plot driven, with a great ending. A good role for Clive Owen who plays his charter cool and controlled. Denzel is Denzel, but the film is entertains to the very end",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Lee's mainstream effort leaves something to be desired,"Considering director Spike Lee's usual, more provocative and heated material, Inside Man, a more conventional suspense thriller seemed a bit of a change of form. Therefore, one would expect the director to have something clever up his sleeve, something genuinely different or shocking, a reason why he would accept a project so seemingly mundane and ordinary. It's likely that assumption that particularly drew viewers to see Inside Man, in short to see the trick Lee had up his proverbial sleeve, the huge twist or execution that would make Inside Man stand out enough to have the director depart from his usual material to accept it.Unfortunately enough, though such a clever twist may seem inherent throughout the film's course, it never really surfaces, leaving us as an audience constantly wanting more, hoping something more interesting and genuinely shocking and throughout provoking might turn up. Needless to say, this never really happens, and as such, Inside Man culminates as nothing more than a watered down run of the mill suspense thriller filled with plot holes and the occasional clever part. The first twist in the ""huge double-twist ending"" becomes so obvious early on in the story that when it surfaces in a crescendo of dramatic music, it doesn't come as surprising at all. The second twist may pose a bit more of a surprise, and may take a bit of thought, but still... one would expect better.And even for those who did not predict either twist early on,there's still the apathy factor. There's a constant sense of ""so what?"" throughout the story, as if the audience starts to question each new occurrence or event throughout the story, half-heartedly hoping that it will somehow lead to a sudden twist one would have to be carefully following to catch. In actuality, when it becomes more and more apparent this isn't going to happen, our minds start to wander and wonder why so much detail is paid to tiny, near insignificant details, or oddball occurrences, such as the constantly resurfacing Indian music, again with no plausible reason or explanation. Quite simply, the film is lacking a spark, a punch, to make the material really hit home and become relevant, or even watchable to us, the viewers. As it is, Lee loses control of us, and instead of being drawn into the half-hearted suspense, we simply wonder what is the point.Denzel Washington is easily the best aspect of the movie, his charismatic, joking, easygoing yet intelligent hostage negotiator is a truly amicable lead, the kind of quality absent from the rest of the film. Clive Owen makes a good enough antagonistic figure as the chief bank robber, but his ""calm but calculating"" side which is meant to make his character seem truly menacing in the end just makes him seem too docile to pose much of an actual threat. Jodie Foster has very little to do in a tiny little role as a mysterious financial adviser sent to speak with Owen's character regarding more under the table matters. She has such a little effect on the story however, that one wonders why her character was included in the story at all, and not just more incorporated into another character. Similarly, the excellent Willem Dafoe is given absolutely nothing to do as a police captain, and it seems such a waste to give such a talented actor such a mundane and devoid of personality role. Christopher Plummer however is a strong presence as the owner of the bank in process of being robbed, who may or may not know more about it than it seems.All in all, Inside Man manages to pass itself off as an intelligent and tense thriller through trailers and publicity, but in the end is nothing special in the least - just another watered down, suspense thriller where the suspense is next to non- existent. There may be the occasional clever or quirky touch, but the inevitable racial component to the story (a particularly memorable scene recalls a bank clerk putting up a huge argument after his turban is removed by the police) is so predictable and out of place it simply raises a groan. Washington may make an excellent lead, but he is the high point in a movie which ultimately comes across as uninspired and uninteresting attempt at breeding tension and suspense. It's not a good sign for a movie's quality and content when the words which come to mind the most are ""so what?"". Such is the case for Inside Man - those not fans of Spike Lee or any of the stars might want to give this one a pass for a more intelligent and engaging thriller.-6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Yeah, Spike!","Although this Spike Lee Joint has more plot holes than a piece of Swiss Cheese, it's a pretty entertaining ride. Denzel (who I always think kicks ass) is a hard hitting negotiator who plays by his own rules. Jodie Foster and Christopher Plummer are slimeballs that are there for him to eat. Clive Owen is awesome as well. Not to mention, Spike is working off a great Hollywood script.

Twist and turns.,"This story was like a roller-coaster ride with all its twists and turns, but by dropping small hints you could still keep up and have somewhat an idea of what you thought might happen. All my friends were also very satisfied with the movie. I believe this is one of the best performances I personally have seen by Clive Owen. And before you ask; Yes, I have seen ""Sin City"", ""Closer"", and ""King Arthur"". The soundtrack did also have it's unique twists. The song in the beginning was sort of remix of a traditional tune from India. Although the majority of viewers don't often buy that style of music, I did notice a lot of people affected by the catchy tune. In the theater people were tapping there feet to the rhythm, on the way out people were humming the tune, and out side the cinema there was actually two girls singing the tune to each other.

This is the best Spike Lee joint in a while.The jury's still out on Clive Owen - can't make out if he's a good actor or not. Jodie Foster was under-utilized.

A Classy Bank Robbery Film.  Well Shot & Acted.,"This movie is one hell of a classy way to tell the story of a bank robbery. Spike Lee brings Gerwitz's story of an unusual bank robbery to life with a stylish noiristic flair. Though this isn't noir film there are definite overtones of the style throughout the film, which adds a greater depth and strength to the movie. Lee made a great choice here because I believe that without this element this could have easily been a boring film. There's not much action as most of the story is about trying to figure out what happened in the bank and just what were the robbers after. Luckily enough there's a plethora of acting talent to make this a very interesting movie, Even Clive Owen works well. I've always thought him to be very flat as an actor - verging on zero dimensional - though his woodenness works here as that persona is perfect for his character.The main letdown of the film is the story, which is also one of its greatest strengths. It's a letdown because it needed a tad more action and tension, there are a few cat and mouse scenes where these could have been expanded upon but were ignored. However, the strength comes from the whole concept, the twists, and the eventual climax of the story, which is brilliantly crafted and woven.The camera work is exemplary and on a couple of occasions beautiful. I particularly liked the pan shot from the rear of the police van as Frazier exits. The camera sweeps up and around, showing the crowd gathered at the cordon, then moves down in a slow arc to the person leaving the bank, surrounded police officers. The movement is so smooth. Then there's a great panning shot of the police officers as they search the bank after the hostages are released. This is, once again so steady and smooth. It was a pleasure to see as there's not a lot of this style of camera work around today.However, not all the camera shots work. The one where Frazier loses his temper and rushes out of the control vehicle is pretty risible and made me wince. Lee puts Washington on a wheeled stage and pulls him forward. at speed giving him a floating come flying movement. This was meant to represent his anger and haste at the situation. Unfortunately, the movement is juddering and the whole shot looks silly and feels wrong for the film; how it didn't end up on the cutting room floor. It would have been better to have Washington just run. Lee should check out the Nun scene from The Blues Brothers as this utilises the effect perfectly and makes the scene just perfect.Though this did detract from the film and breaks the link between the movie and its audience it doesn't do it to the point of hitting the off button.In fact, I would recommend this film to everybody who likes police procedures and stories with a mystery with plenty of twists. Back when this was made this would have been pretty original, though today, a lot of the issues in this film have been used quite a few times. A bank robbery that isn't a bank robbery. How do you get out of the building without being captured? Though, with Lee's involvement and the great cast, this is still worth a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"smart, gripping thriller","From director Spike Lee comes this taut, skillful thriller about a complex N.Y.C. bank heist that evolves into a test of wills between a brilliant robber and a veteran police officer. Owen plays a bold criminal mastermind who unveils a daring scheme to pull off what he views as the perfect bank robbery; Washington is the seasoned hostage negotiator trying to diffuse the situation, all the while suspecting that there's more to the story especially after the intervention of a shady power broker who may be playing both sides (Foster). Effective crime caper is crafty, suspenseful, and well-acted, with diverse characterizations and the added bonus of a script that throws out unique twists at just the right moments.

Awesome Movie!!!,"This movie was awesome. I was always a Denzel fan and this made me love him even more. I had seen a few Clive Owen movies before, but this movie made me fall in love with him. Talk about loving both sides of the coin. Very exciting and smart, and even funny at points. I suggest anyone who likes any kind of fun, action movie see this movie. I left the theater, both times, saying that I was going to buy this movie! Spike Lee always amazes me with his talent to take a typical movie situation and turn it into something fresh and exciting. Bank robber movies are old news, but this movie brings a new twist to the old formula. Jody Foster is great in this movie as well, and her chemistry with Denzel is amazing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
You just have to get tired of this kind of movies,"It's nothing new. You get a bunch of first class actors, or at least having famous names, then you get a classic plot, you change the twist, you bag the money. It's simpler than robbing a bank, because it's legal. But it should be outlawed, that's for certain.The movie is not bad. The direction is obviously good, the budget appropriate, the acting excellent. It's the plot that makes it all crap. And the end moral, about punishing the people that benefited from the Holocaust? That makes me sick. I am sure that event payed itself with interest just from the clich√© movies that came out of it. And those last scenes, just after a short critique on the exaggeration of racial issues in America, with a cop twisting his tongue to say ""african American"". And it's a Spike Lee movie. He could have found a black people massacre to reference, or was it a requirement from the producers? Bleah!Conclusion: very average bank robery movie, with a rather boring beginning, and a tired old twist, reminiscent of the 60 movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Excellent movie, among Lee's best in many ways.","It was promoted as a straight-forward, slick-as-can-be bank heist movie in the trailers (and it is that) but it also ranges over themes that are much more serious and very unexpected. Even though I knew there was ""more to this one"" from vague comments I'd heard in the press, opening paragraphs of reviews I avoided reading, etc., I still didn't expect where it was going at all. The script is tighter than a drum and motivations of all major characters are both deep and well drawn and thus always believable. As an excercise in scripting, it's really one of the more remarkable pieces I've watched or read in a long time. Lee is easily up to the task and manages to make the movie both the slick, clever and exciting heist thriller you were hoping for as well as a movie with real depth and heart far beyond what would normally be expected from the genre. The movie doesn't look very much like a typical Spike Lee movie, though there are the occasional graces that remind you of who is calling the shots. Every actor in the film hits the perfect note for their roles, even the minor players who have few lines and brief scenes. One of my favorite small roles is a construction worker who briefly helps the cops with some information they need that could be key to helping deal with the robbers (this isn't a spoiler). Just how the guy swaggers over to the cops' mobile command vehicle was so perfectly pitched, so true to life as that of a proud New York working-man, I knew instantly who this guy was because I'd met him a hundred times on the streets here. It's that kind of attention to detail that helps make this story really live on the screen. It's an incredibly impressive movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A classy Spike joint.,"""Pouring new wine into the bottle of the Western, Peckinpah explodes the bottle"" Pauline kael once remarked of Sam Peckinpah. Spike Lee doesn't quite break the aged bottle of the heist picture, but he shakes some dust off. And I reckon Bloody Sam would have liked what he poured.Not in terms of violence. It's a little hectic, but there's no bloody showdowns. But there's an old time slickness about the shooting, a polish and finesse that todays crop of hacks couldn't touch with their epilepsy inducing ADHD shooting styles.That said, the stylish touches manage not to weigh down a brisk, thoughtful, and above all original script. You think you know where it's going, you even guess some of the twists, but like any devoted student of film history Spike manages to send the viewer down a few blind alleys, a few dead ends, and some ultimately rewarding unexpected detours.Denzal Washington is, as ever, pure class, making it look effortless in a way De Niro once did, but without piling on the worthiness or shedding a touch of light humour. Clive Owen is solid, more then able to hold up intervals that may have lulled under lessor directors. Jody Fosters role, effectively a cameo, felt like stunt casting but was a nice touch (a somewhat out of character role for Foster, in line with her more recent voyages of discovery). The whole cast were up to Spike Lee's normal high ensemble standard, no one underused or underplayed, no one trying to run away with the show.Well worth two hours of anyones time. The likes of Brett Ratner should bring a notepad and pencil, learn a few things.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Really enjoyable,"This was a pleasant surprise for me. It's less arty than the other Spike Lee films I've seen, and it plays more as straight entertainment without being bogged down politics or pretension. Don't get me wrong, It still has a few of his signature touches, but it's a nice change of pace for the director.I thought the first 20 minutes or so were a little dull, but once it gets going, it sucks you right in. ""Inside Man"" is witty, smart and suspenseful, with great acting all over the place.I think It ends up falling a little bit short of greatness, mostly due to the slow beginning and some tiny plot holes, but it's Lee's best film since ""He Got Game"" and I may warm to it more with repeated viewings.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Great thriller.,"This is a good title, all in all. It plays itself just right in thriller terms, being quite reminiscent of Phonebooth or perhaps The Negotiator in pace. The plot is nothing we haven't seen before, but it tries to tell us that story in using forks in the road we haven't often been down. It's final twist is smart, if not slightly expected, but will leave many satisfied with a good ending. Washington is his usual self, great acting, but it's nothing we haven't seen him in before. Owen again, pretty generic, but no one is hit-and-miss in this film, everything plays out consistently and there are enough comic moments to ensure an ease from the tension and strife. I sound clinical, but really, this is a good film, definitely worth watching. It doesn't have that special something that Phonebooth or The Negotiator does, but it is a good attempt at a keep-you-guessing thriller. 7/10 from me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"A great New York film, a thriller with NYC ironic humor!","Reading the mixed reviews posted here I wonder if you have to possess that special brand of irony with which New Yorkers are imbued, a sense of humor in the face of disaster or the threat of it anyway, if you're going to 'get' this movie. Spike Lee and his phenomenal cast (besides the incomparable Denzel, Clive, Jodie and Chris, there's a rich gathering of NY character actors and 'real people') deliver the tragi-comic nuances of an adventure where perception is continually being altered by circumstances that look one way while the full dimensions of the actual reality hide in plain sight until the very end. The dialogue is as savvy and witty as I've heard in a long time. I think a really big clue to appreciating this film is the understanding that everyone, no matter what their pay grade (Foster refers to Washington's as a means of putting him in his place--she changes her view completely by film's end), takes actions according to their perceptions and everyone therefore can fail to see what is directly in front of them. Everyone makes what in movie plot terms are stupid mistakes, but what in real life terms are manifestations of a tragic flaw in consciousness. And people can wise up sometimes, as some do in this film.I recently watched the film again, and what fun it was to see the set-ups realizing exactly what they meant. Or at least I had a better idea! Great film, don't miss it.Followup on this comment:I should also have mentioned Chiwetel Ejiofor and Willem Dafoe, also outstanding.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
fabulous,"Just plainly loved it. A movie critic from one of our local newspapers mentioned that we may still be asking ourselves questions at the end of the movie. And I sure did. But won't submit them. Could be spoilers. All I can say is DON'T MISS IT. Money well spent, and takes you away from your little daily chores and problems. It also made me discover Clive Owens as an actor. And for the rest of them, well, I do not believe Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster, Christopher Plummer as well as Willem Dafoe need much introduction, do they? And the intro music, as well as the generic one (at the end) will just rock you on your seats. Wonder if there will be some sort of soundtrack. Just ear-blasting.

"Good entertainment with many good performances, but basically escapist entertainment.","Assuming that you saw the trailer, everyone knows that bank robbers take hostages, and somehow the bank robbers dress up the hostages to look like themselves.The movie is entertaining and fun to watch. I most enjoyed the supporting characters --people like the individual hostages, and the detective's wife. All these little roles made the movie better.The main story is about how are the robbers going to get away with it, and there are some clever twists, that are pretty satisfying.My main objection and why this is not a GREAT picture is that it is only a cops & robbers movie that is done for fun. It is not about any greater theme. The movie is fun to watch, but other movies are fun too. That makes it seven stars.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Nothing really new in this heist flick, but ...","... it's really well done. If you see the movie, you might have guessed what this movie is aiming for (because you've seen similar heist movies), but still you will be amazed by this film! And that is a credit to all involved (starting from the scriptwriter, to the producers, director and cast).Although I have to say that I don't think you can guess, where this movie is going to go 100%. But it's cut and pasted together in a manner, that will make multiple views of the film more than enjoyable. So you might not understand what is going on, when you see a flash""forward"" (as opposed to a flashback, but I just created that word, I don't think it exists), but you will get there sooner than later. Because Spike Lee knows that the audience is not stupid, he partly gives away the ending ...

Inside Man will keep you inside the theater more than once.,"For a Spike LeeJoint, it wasn't surprising that Denzel was a lead in the casting. I was, however; very surprised that Clive Owen agreed to bless this movie with his acting presence. Owen was the only reason this movie was a ****10***instead of an absolute snooze. The plot is the best anyone should expect from Lee. Cut and dry with a few very minor twists that attempt to lead the viewer toward a different conclusion. The story was hardly ""original"". Hats off to the cast 100%. Now, the good part. Despite Lee's B movie talent as a director and producer, he was an A list genius in choosing the cast. Washington needs no praise. The Oscar winner has once again proved his ability to adapt to any character. Clive Owen has yet again brought his highly under-appreciated talent from the UK to the US. If he were a one man show for the entire 2 hours, there isn't a person in the the theater that could have been disappointed. Owen's face being covered for the majority of the film had zero impact whatsoever on his believable character and capability to ""bring it"". If that doesn't scream Acadamy Award, I don't know what does. Owen, and Owen alone made this movie Excellent. Jodie Foster's role was a waste of time and would have shortened the flick without disappointment. Fabulous actress, but no need to be written into the script. Although, it was a pleasure to see her, it was a needless waste of money. What we need to recognize in the ""Hollywood"" boredom of the same faces the majority of the time, (only because of an Oscar nod) is that once in a great while a nomination actually makes sense to the rest of the world. Owen's nomination in Closer was a movie that we could say, ""Oh yeah, I know that movie."" Instead of ""Huh? Never heard of it"" Fortunately, some of the best director's of our time have taken note and he has been cast in numerous films. Unfortunately, time and time again he has to make it his own in order for it to be worth the $10.00 at 7pm on a Saturday night. (Look at ""Derailed"". My oh my, Jennifer Aniston?????? The girl from ""Friends""???? Enough said.) ""Inside Man"" is the result of Excellence due to brilliant acting and casting. It doesn't disappoint in that area, and makes the somewhat, boring storyline fade to black in comparison",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Not Your Average Heist Film...,"A great movie should be like a great kiss: leaving you goosebumps and wanting more. ""Inside Man"" is that great kiss.It takes a premise as old as celluloid; a bank heist, and toys around with it and even at times laughs at itself. The writing is taut, the acting and direction is supreme. Spike Lee has achieved a rare thing: a commercial action movie that ask questions and makes the audience think.Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Christopher Plummer and Jodie Foster are sensational as to be expected, but the other various actors in the role as hostages and robbers alike are just as wonderful.If I had to voice one complaint it would be that the movie goes on 15 minutes longer than it needed to.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"A well-crafted, complex heist movie","One piece of advice has to dominate any review of this complex bank heist movie: Don't take your eyes off the screen for one second. If you do you're liable to miss something that will then leave you confused for the rest of the film. In fact, after you've seen it once you will probably want to watch it through again to check up on a couple of points. It is that kind of movie.If that puts you off seeing it, it isn't meant to. This is a good film, well-crafted and nicely directed, with some genuinely surprising twists and a decent set of performances from reliable stars like Clive Owen, Willem Defoe and Jodie Foster. It falls short of being excellent though, perhaps because the pace is allowed to sag at times. It is maybe a little longer than it needs to be. And - hard as they try - none of the actors manages to create any great sympathy for their characters. Some viewers might like that, in that it allows you to concentrate on the events of the plot. Others may feel it lacks emotional depth.But overall it's a decent film, certainly worth seeing. It's one you have to concentrate on though.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

I have never been a huge fan of Washington since i find he acts with a sense of smugness and has never been able to pull of 'romantic' and although Foster is usually great, she is not known though for relaxed and sexy.Well she is incredibly sexy here and after Panic Room and Flighplan, its great to see her not locked in somewhere.

Interesting Spike Lee Film that Fails to Finish,"An Interesting Director, Spike Lee, if the Not the Most Subtle. He has an Excellent Eye and Loves to do Camera Flourishes and Off Beat Montages.

The Ending is Weak and Unsatisfying, All the While Wallowing in its ""Cleverness"", Parading Itself Around with a ""Look at Me"" Glare that is About as Subtle as a Pole Stripper.But Getting to the End is the Fun, and Lee is Patient Getting You There, Filling the Film with His Typically Heavy Handed Social and Political Commentary. There are the Usual Suspects, Like Racist Cops, Fat Cat Followers of Satan, the Nazis, the Jews, and the Most Overused Spike Lee Target, White People.

Absorbing but unsatisfying,"Spike Lee's 'Inside Man', a film about hostage-taking bank robbers in New York, at one point name-checks 'Dog Day Afternoon', another film with a similar subject matter. But whereas that film, as with Lee's own early work, was an authentic portrait of the hard lives of ordinary Americans, 'Inside Man' is high-grade tosh. Lee can do this sort of thing, he even does it quite well, but there's a fundamental shallowness here: the motiveless criminal, the super-cool, super-connected Miss Fixit, the evil banker who once did a deal with the Nazis (and I'm no friend of the Nazis, but the use of ""Nazi"" as a convenient shorthand for an evil which cannot be questioned and which is by definition completely different to the evil of any other customer who any other banker might conceivably have dealt with is typical of the laziness of the film's grander concepts, however well worked out the details). Moreover, the essential trick of the movie is intrinsically undramatic, and the film's structure is highly constrained as Lee attempts to extract some impact from the idea.

Spike and D is back... Inside Man is a must see!,"Spike and Denzel team up once again for his latest ""joint"" Inside Man. Inside Man is the story of a cop that matches his wits with a clever bank robber played by Clive Owen. I know it's going to sound very redundant, but this is an entertaining heist flick. Everyone may jump to call this film Spike's first ""mainstream"" film, but this is very much a Spike Lee joint. From the signature dolly shots to the social messages in some scenes, it's all here. Spike also benefited with the stellar cast that includes Jodie Foster, who looked stunning by the way, and veteran actor Christopher Plummer. Spike's work on this film showed his versatility. Most of his films are seen as indie's and to think of Spike making an action flick was too absurd, but he pulls it off here so smoothly and we could probably see more like it from him. It was a breath of fresh air after the critically panned She Hate Me, a movie that I somewhat enjoyed but wanted more out of. Inside Man was everything that I expected it to be and more.

This Movie S.U.C.K.S.,"I don't know who wrote the other comments for this movie but I have a sneaking suspicion they work for the studio that produced the movie. Why do I say that? Because this movie was terrible.Somebody somewhere wanted to make a New York heist movie, and they got their hands on this weak script. So, as they do with all weak scripts, they threw money at it. They gave it a big budget, a well-known director (Lee) an A-list lead (Denzel) and a few of ""thespian"" secondary players (Foster, Dafoe and Owen) in hopes of making this ""joint"" classy.They failed miserably.Instead what you get is a jumbled heist movie with a racial commentary. Think Crash meets Die Hard meets the Negotiator.The dialogue is trite, and the plot really doesn't go anywhere. The actors' performances are as follows:Denzel is the same character in this movie as he is in 98% of his other movies.Dafoe is in it for the cash (nothing wrong with that, he's a cool dude).Foster needed a gig where she wasn't protecting her daughter from kidnappers.Owen is also in it for the cash (nothing wrong with that, he's a cool dude).And Christopher Plummer is the exact same guy he played in Syriana.The music score sucks, and the sub-plot with Denzel and his wife is useless and boring. What do I care about this guy's personal life? If I'm watching a movie like this, I want suspense and possibly some 'splosions, not a love story that goes nowhere.Then there's the whole Nazi diamond thing they stole from Marathon Man. The antagonists of this film, if you boil it down, are Nazis. Nazis. Seriously, when a New York heist movie that takes place in the present has to rely on Nazis, and not neo-Nazis but the ones from World War II, then something is seriously wrong. It worked in Marathon Man thirty years ago. It doesn't work here.In addition to all this awfulness, the movie does not want to end. You're sitting there waiting for it to end and it just drags on and on. Watch this movie when it becomes a movie of the week on television a few years from now.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Standard twisty-turny thriller but with a brilliantly novel twist of social commentary and humour,"This is a great movie... there's very little that can be held against it. Spike Lee has taken what appears to have been your everyday suspenseful thriller and made it into one of the best films of the year thus far. Fast moving but heavy on characterisation, thrilling and suspenseful but playful and clever, socially aware but seldom preachy and always with a wry undercurrent of brilliantly unexpected humour, all in all this film kicks ass!To sum up the basic plot: Clive Own is the man who has planned the perfect bank robbery, you know this because he tells you he's done it, the only question is whether we're hearing him before or after the heist... The principle is fairly simple. Along with three other masked associates he has developed a scheme that is supposedly full proof, involving misdirection, the creation of chaos and the possibility for great reward in more ways than one... Denzel Washington, along with the excellent Chiwetel Ejiofor as his partner, is the black detective tasked with overseeing hostage negotiations. Willem Dafoe is the put upon police captain in charge of the whole goddamn mess, Peter Kybart is the very put upon mayor of New York dragged in to proceedings, Christopher Plummer is the very rich owner of the bank with a very guilty secret buried there (he is also fairly put upon) and Jody Foster is, quite frankly, the horrendous bitch employed by Plummer to keep his secret safe. She does much of the putting onto the other characters...All the players, aside from Foster who appears to be having the time of her life playing the opposite to all those sensitive souls thrust onto her since Taxi Driver, are on very familiar territory and they clearly enjoy their roles, perhaps with the exception Plummer, thanks mainly to the numerous jokes, gags and other material they get to perform in front of, where I watched it, a cinema packed to the rafters. Whoever produced this film (Universal I think) has really gone all out to get the punters in and it helped the movie a great deal. Having a full house encouraged that kind of group bond where the jokes and situations appear that bit funnier.It could be that phenomenon which made me enjoy Inside Man so much, but I certainly didn't mind the obvious plot holes and massive leaps of faith required of our suspension of disbelief. At any one point in this movie the various protagonists would be undone by one single person failing to act absolutely according to plan... this includes both Denzel Washington and Clive Owen, whose characters are both on extremely thin ice... Owen due to becoming a hostage taking bank robber and Washington because of a recent question over some missing funds from a case he worked.However, I was totally prepared to accept the ludicrousness of the situations presented to us, which was highly unusual for me. The reason? Spike Lee. The self styled king of modern, black, American political cinema takes the hackneyed plot of just another thriller and turns it into a massive diatribe against the hypocrisy of modern New Yorkers. Instead of the colour blind, metropolitan city the Big Apple is currently portrayed as, in recent years, where films suggesting all isn't right socially are seen as either trying to blacken a good city's name or as years behind the times, Lee uses this new medium, for him, of the thriller to turn an eye on what he sees in the New York of 2006.The cops are mostly racist, bigoted and incompetent, attitudes Washington and Ejiofor's characters are not exempt from. At various points during the movie the police show extreme measures against hostages who are simply honest citizens of New York, perhaps best summed up with their taking down of a dark skinned bank teller ('My God, it's an Arab!' 'I'm not an Arab I'm a Sikh...!'). Similarly, the various women involved do not enjoy a fun time with New York's finest either. Funnily enough, though, for a man so interested in modern, ignored bigotry, Lee fails to offer any moments where homosexuals are involved in proceedings. It could be that this is deliberate and that New York really has become totally acceptant of gay men and women... or there could be another reason for the absence. Regardless, the lack of a particular branch of intolerance is in no way felt at the time due to the constant bombardment on the numerous divides that still exist between the two sexes and the numerous racial groups... as one police sergeant very aptly puts it; 'I'd rather be an old bigot than a handsome corpse...!' this said, of course, to that hero of good, honest, black characters, Denzel Washington!Inside Man is resplendent with these images, angles and wry amusement. Laugh out loud moments are plentiful and the overall story arc is quick enough to maintain an interest without sacrificing on developing an empathy between the audience and the protagonists. Lee has taken his shot at a mainstream piece of cinema and has most likely satisfied an adequate commercial cross section of the audience without alienating or betraying his political roots. This film is altogether excellent and the acting, though unlikely to trouble anyone next awards season, is in tune with the piece. Similarly we have a director reigning in his most ardent voice but not silencing it completely, allowing a very fresh perspective on a standard and lacklustre genre. This gives us a whole new look at two simultaneously over and under subscribed subjects: the thriller and the modern New York city. To my mind it was high time we had both! All in all I highly recommend Inside Man.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Take a lesson from a teacher,"Who else but the brilliant director Spike Lee could take a fairly routine bank heist flick with a few innovative twists and turn it into a two-hour-plus action marathon which is also a vestibule for entertainment? Spike Lee uses fantastic camera shots, film editing, and flash forwards to deliver the goods. He also extracts excellent performances from the entire cast, especially Jodie Foster and Christopher Plummer. Foster plays the unusual part of a confidential agent for the bank owner played by Plummer. Kudos also to the actress who plays the Albanian interpreter.The story involves the robbing of a bank in New York City (some of the same street locations were used in 16 Blocks). Listen attentively to the mastermind Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) as he addresses the audience at the beginning of the film. What he says takes on new meaning when he repeats it at the end of the movie. Hostage negotiator Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) is assigned the difficult task of talking the gunmen down and rescuing those being held captive. He desires to make a good showing since his job is on the line because of misappropriated drug money. The negotiation process turns out to be a ball of confusion. Before the ending, the viewer is taken on an exciting journey with all types of convolutions and U-turns.The music is some of the best used in recent Hollywood films. ""Chaiyya Chaiyya"" adds much to the beginning of the movie to set the proper atmosphere and to grab the audience's attention.Too bad Spike Lee is not available to direct more action flicks.

Spike Lee + an intelligent heist film?  Don't worry.,"Inside Man, by Spike Lee, is by far one of the most impressive theatrical experiences I've attended all year. I can tell you this because going to the movies has not yielded many quality experiences. From the moment it begins, there is clearly an urban vibe; the shots of Manhattan, not to mention the movie being billed as ""A Spike Lee joint"" give it a grittier tone. Do not let these minor touches fool you; as the movie progresses, it helps to not go in with preconceived notions of the typical Spike Lee movie. Denzel Washington plays a hostage-situation negotiator, Clive Owen the antagonist, and Jodie Foster the mysterious femme fatale who seems to know much more than she lets on. All of these roles are carried out with overwhelming class and finesse, a true work of art to see all the pieces in motion. Spike Lee's direction helps to execute scenes that clearly convey to the viewer what they are intended to show, and all these elements come together to create a great piece and an especially sweet outing for fans of ""heist"" movies.One area you could expect to see that is almost expected of a Spike Lee movie is the social commentary; the almost constant references to racism and racial hatred are almost to be expected and are delivered with the grittiness you come to expect from Lee, from the almost abusive but certainly overbearing incapacitation of a Muslim-American (including the removal of his turban, a severe insult to the Muslim-American community) to the references to Usama Bin Laden and flagging taxi-cabs, Lee does a passable job of portraying the Muslim-American as the new Black.Aside from minor problems with the acting (Jodie Foster's character seems a little subdued for her taste, but the differences are subtle) and the almost inevitable racially stunted social commentary, Inside Man comes together as one of Spike Lee's finest.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A Counter Twisting Movie,"9 April 2006. Like The Village, The Inside Man uses the 180 degree twist and to pretty good effect. This mystery thriller built up slowly, perhaps too slowly for some, in its convoluted plot about a bank heist. Strangely this good-feeling movie manages to reveal all in one of the ""longest explanations"" of any movie and short changes the screen time of Jodie Foster creating some imbalance in the overall presentation of the movie. Yet this is a tight, more cerebral mystery movie, that doesn't quit have the same intense bite of The Crying Game or the Usual Suspects. Yet it does have more of a sympathetic and uplifting message, something well received in these more fearful and uncertain times. Seven out of Ten Stars.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Extremely entertaining but nothing more,"This is a very entertaining action movie, based on a ""perfect"" bank robbery, with nice performance by Denzel Washington in leading role and nothing less impressive Clive Owen and Jodie Foster in supporting roles. Although you might think there is nothing more to be filmed on that topic, you better think again. However, I do have one, little objection, maybe the movie is progressing too slow, although that could be intensional, so that the audience could understand it, due to it's complex, but truly fascinating story. I recommend this movie if you are looking for a relaxation after a hard day, but do not expect anything of a style of ""The Dog Day Afternoon"", because it is not that kind of movie, it does not have a moral lesson, or something like that. From my point of view, it is made just for entertainment, and if that really was Spike Lee's intention, then he has succeeded. Have fun!",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Great Movie,"Is it only me but does anybody think the there were more than four people involved in the heist? I think there were, at least, four other accomplices involved (The rabbi, the rack, the kid who wouldn't wear his mask, and the old lady who refused to take off her clothes). Here's my reasoning: At the end of the movie, after everyone was questioned, Denzel Washington said that all the kidnap victims vouched for each other. This was not a bank robbery but an attempt to unmask the bank president who became rich on the backs of the Jews during WWII. Maybe I'm over thinking this but I think the original crew needed the accomplices to throw off the police which would explain why the rabbi and the old woman would go along, knowing that it was never going to be a bank robbery. Anyway, when the movie comes out on DVD, I'm going to watch it very carefully with my finger on the pause button.

A solid cast (un)rolls a complex 'joint'.,"I must shamefully admit that this is the second movie from 2006 besides V for Vendetta that I've had the chance to see. Not much I know, but is it just me or has 2006 so far been the crappiest year for film since... who knows. Anyway this is my second Spike Lee's 'joint' besides 25th Hour and I must say it's pretty striking.Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster and Christopher Plummer all played their characters fluently without having any problems but Clive Owen is the one that had some minor greatness attached to him after all. His intro was awesome and I consider it to be one the film's best moments.Since all of the action evolves around the bank robbery, we are pretty sure that the only motive for doing it is money. And if we wouldn't have been questioned about the 'why' in the beginning it would have seemed even weirder as it did. No I won't give away the plot, I'll just say that I'm glad I knew very little about it. The last half an hour turned the movie upside-down three times for me.It's not without it's problems though. The problem is the films pace and narrative which are pretty 'genrey' in the first hour, but I feel that a lot could have been made better. The tension could have been screwed up tighter but you feel as if a lot is saved for the last half an hour. And yes a lot of (side) characters could have been developed a bit better. Yup, the hostage situation was definitely robbed of it's tension because of the last part. And because the robbers were too nice.Although this is a 'medium' budget Hollywood flick and by no chance an independent one, as I've said, you will be surprised. At least from that point of view. I know I was and I regret I didn't see it in a theater just because I couldn't hear the audience say ""WTF(?), roll it back please"". So yes paying strict attention is required. Otherwise see it again like I did........ - 4/5 .......",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Excellent acting, Excellent plot, all around excellent",This was one of the most original movies that I had seen in a long time. I was continually guessing and continually wrong. Denzel was excellent as was Jodie Foster. Amazing movie! It actually cracked my Top 25. As good as the movie was... technically I was disturbed by sound volumes in certain parts of the movie. Dialogue was low volume. The action scenes were incredibly loud. This could have been just the theater that I was in.Some things were a bit confusing it took me awhile to figure out the cut away scenes (was this actually happening or imagined).Once again if you don't see the movie in theater's I believe your missing out on some technical elements that add to the film. But none the less this movie is a no miss.,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
pleasantly surprised... sometimes,"I'll be honest: ""Inside Man"" is not Oscar-worthy. But neither is it fantastically horrible. It's one of those movies you borrow from Netflix (because hey, why not?), enjoy on a Saturday afternoon, and forget you ever watched two weeks later.""Inside Man"" has three things going for it: Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, and a complicated (if not a little convoluted) plot. Washington excels as the fast-talking, fast-thinking main character. I'm sure he has more than twice the lines of everyone else in the movie, including Clive Owen. Mr. Owen has not impressed me with most of his previous work (perhaps with the exception of ""The Closer""), but his complex character and the way he fleshed him out was fascinating to me. The plot, though filled with holes, is interesting and complex enough to keep everyone guessing almost to the end. I also liked the subtle things the movie had to say about race, gender, and age relations.On the downside, there's Jodie Foster. Though I usually enjoy her work, she was completely wrong for this part. The most annoying part of her performance is her odd hand motions, which I suppose were part of her character...? I thought her inclusion in the movie was somewhat unneeded.I was also extremely offended by the use of the ""c"" word... completely unnecessary and cringe-worthy, especially coming out of Christopher Plummer's mouth. Otherwise, I enjoyed it and would highly recommend it to any casual movie-watcher,",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Really enjoyed this movie ( A+ Movie) My Ratings 10/10,"Well-directed, tense, and well-written by Russell Gewirtz with slick dialogue and a good story and has a great performance by Denzel Washington. Probably one of my favorite Spike Lee movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Inside Man proves a good mainstream heist film,"The trailers for this movie opened with actor Clive Owen chatting directly with the camera and claiming he'd planned the perfect bank robbery. There are only two ways a movie can go after a statement like that. Either it will prove entertainingly clever, or it will fall flat either by telescoping plot twists or being utterly predictable. It was a true movie thrill to find that Inside Man is a terrific example of the former.Remember the last time you visited your bank? It was likely just another in the list of errands you had that day. Other people, each conducting their own business and running their own errands were almost certainly there with you, though you probably didn't know each other and you exchanged nods and smiles at best. Then imagine that ordinary scene ripped apart by gun-wielding mask-wearing bank robbers, and how you might feel shivering on the floor next to those strangers with whom you suddenly have a crisis in common.Dalton Russell (Clive Owens) and his partners have planned just such a scene, and they execute it perfectly. In a matter of minutes, the four robbers have herded bank employees and customers alike into manageable bunches and are well on their way through an apparent checklist of ""things to do to rob a bank."" But it also doesn't take long for a cop to notice something funny is going on at the Manhattan bank and to call for help.With so many innocent civilians inside the building, one of those called in is hostage negotiator Detective Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington). Frazier isn't anybody's first choice ¬ó he's under investigation for the theft of some money seized as evidence ¬ó but his commanding officer has no one else who can go. So along with his partner, Detective Bill Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor), Frazier heads to the scene.When Frazier arrives, the police have the situation well in hand with blockades to keep civilians away and a mobile command center on site run by Captain John Darius (Willem Dafoe). Frazier takes command on his arrival, but his efforts aren't helped by the begrudging cooperation of Darius nor by the exorbitant demands received from the robbers. His world is about to be complicated still further when the mysterious Madeline White (Jodie Foster) arrives on scene.White, who shows up in the company of no less a personage than New York's mayor himself, has been hired by the bank's owner, the wealthy Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer) to minimize the PR damage that could occur as a result of the robbery. But Frazier begins to suspect that there are agendas far beyond the mere success of a robbery or the public concern of the bank's owner. As a result, he's utterly bound up in the chaos of Dalton's perfect crime as it whipsaws its course defined in part by the machinations of others.Denzel Washington is always good, and he's no exception here. What's nice is that he's allowed to be a little less serious than he sometimes is, and he carries off Detective Frazier's sass and biting humor with real aplomb. Clive Owen fleshes out his character with shades of grey that mitigate the black and white of good and bad behavior in ways that add a good deal to the plot. Jodie Foster, who is so often the heroine of a film, is a morally ambiguous character here. Though the Oscar¬Æ winner's skills can't be doubted, it was still a bit of a surprise to see just how biting and arrogant a woman she can play. The large supporting cast is also just fine.I'm not personally a big Spike Lee fan. I don't care for urban films, and I'm not impressed by Lee's politics, either. But he was surprisingly effective in his direction of this movie's more mainstream appeal, and I walked out of the theatre with a newfound respect for his abilities. The editing was superlative, particularly in its creative use of flash-forwards (as opposed to the more commonly seen flashbacks); there were a few truly creative camera angles and one inspired stop motion scene as well.While Lee ably directed the picture, a good deal of credit must go to writer Russell Gewirtz who makes his major motion picture debut with his script for Inside Man. It's entertaining; it's smart; and while it's not truly believable, it's plausible enough that audiences can be gripped by the plot and dragged along its often surprising twists and turns.As an aside, I don't typically notice the music in movies. If it's really good, you shouldn't. It should enhance scenes, not steal them. The music for the opening and closing credits of Inside Man, however, is particularly striking. It's an unusual choice to be sure, but it's somehow perfect for the job. I didn't notice a note between the beginning and the end of the movie though I don't doubt it was there; but I'm still humming the tune chosen to underlie the credits.If you're headed out to the theatre to be educated or inspired, perhaps you'll consider seeing something else. But if you're looking for pure action entertainment, Inside Man is the perfect ""now showing"" venue.FAMILY SUITABILITY: Inside Man is rated R for ""language and some violent images."" I don't agree with that rating. There's no language in the film that the average 14 year-old doesn't hear in school or on his iPod on a regular basis, and the violence is far from graphic. (The single most graphic scene involves a video game ¬ó which, when you think about it, makes quite a point in the midst of an action movie.) I think most teens will like Inside Man, and as a bonus, so will most adults. I enjoyed it immensely myself.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Not just a typical movie with some stars in it,"In short, this movie is a blast amount others. It's not just like ""Fire Wall"" only having a star, Harrison Ford summoning you to go see it. In starring, ""Inside Man"", for sure, is really smart. Jodie Froster and Denzel Washington, they already the ones can attract you to go in the theater, but especially the last leading role, Clive Owen. I've fallen into the movie since I saw the trailer. A short soliloquy of him would do the huge gravity of the movie already. ""Because I can""(seems like Clinton) This can deliver the power of it. What some more? The background music of it. Actually, this movie only has one ""official theme music."" It's like some kind of middle-east style music. It's will make you feel like you are watching ""Syriana,"" pretty doesn't fit a crime drama takes place in New York City. From the beginning Clive Owen gets his van in Coney Island, picking up his partners and drive toward Wall Street. It makes you feel that this movie won't be like any other crime drama. At least Spike Lee doesn't want it be. Beside the well starring and funny-fitted music, the most outstanding of it is the screen write, like it's dialogue and ""cold jokes."" Again, not like ""Fire Wall,"" Lee doesn't just grab three stars and tell them let their faces be seen in the picture only. The dialogues from them really make ""the characters have character."" Everyone in the movie is attractive through the chemistry of it. Also the jokes form it. All the jokes happen smoothly. From the old lady doesn't want to stripe off, you will have an idea that this movie not just having a great star attraction, also a nice black comedy. One scene had done the nice combine of ""characterized character"" and ""cold joke."" It's about the forth interlude that Denzel Washington and Chiwetel Ejiofor having ""individual interview"" of all the hostages/suspects, that they are interviewing the ""big tits"" woman (by the Asian guy). The camera supposedly that takes Denzel Washington and Chiwetel Ejiofor in a really tight shot. And Chiwetel Ejiofor just can't take his eyes from ""them."" From these reasons, that's for sure it is an ultra-standing movie amount others.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Awful,"This movie had so much potential - a strong cast, a reasonably strong idea and clearly a decent budget. I'm not sure where it all went wrong, but each of those elements was wasted. The story went nowhere, the characters were hollow to say the least and the result was a very boring, pointless, waste of a film. I hated it. Judging by the other votes, I'm in the minority here and must be some sort of freak. However, I thought this movie was dreadful. I had high hopes, but was very disappointed. A particular disappointment was Jody Foster's character. A very cocky ""fixer"" of sorts makes a nice idea. Jody was confident and sexy, but the character did nothing and went nowhere. Denzel Washington played the same character he always plays - enjoyable but nothing new.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

A great detective fiction,"People you are rating this movie low are the problem with the average movie going public these days. Throw a few explosions at them, and some whacked out main character that solves his problems with fists and they rate it a ten. And you get extra points for CGI it seems.This movie was great! It reminds me of some of the old detective fictions that were made in the 30's and 40's like the Maltese Falcon, and then later on in the 70's Chinatown. No, Denzel didn't use a gun and blow stuff up ever chance he got, but he was intelligent and methodical in solving the case. It was actually quite nice to see Denzel finally step out of his role as the 'angry black man' and do something different. Until this point, I was convinced he was quite one dimensional.This movie moved us through the 3 stages of a detective fiction very fluidly. It also managed to do it in a modern context. While using all the new tricks of film and the technology that we have developed, the film still adhering to the classic detective fiction motif.The filming was excellent, and the director managed to get tons of great shots in that helped to set the tone for the movie. The closeups on the characters, the rackish angles that cause uneasiness, and the double focuses helped to present us with a story and feeling that is really unsurpassed by just about anything that has come out this year.

We have toake sure we push back against this new trend as it is destroying entertainment and good content.

"Movie Schitzo's Review of ""Inside Man""","This is probably the first Spike Lee movie I have ever seen and I must say this was a very good and very tasteful movie. Denzel Washington. Clive Owen. Jodie Foster. Spike Lee. What a combination. A great story. A great twist. A great crime. The story is simple, yet it's not. The story is like this: ""Hello, my name is Dalton Russel, pay strict attention to what I am saying because I chose my words very carefully, and I never repeat myself..."", That is what crime specialist Dalton Russel (Owen) says after he plans to rob one of the most high security banks in NYC and walk right out the front door. Dalton and his crew go into the bank disguised as painters and hold up the place. That is where the story begins. Hostage Negoitiater Keith Fraizer(Washington) is called in to try to save some of the hostages. Meanwhile Madeline White (Foster) has been blackmailing the owner of the bank Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer). Meanwhile the police are circling the bank and no one will escape. Denzal Washington is main person in this movie and he carries it very well. The other leading man, Clive Owen, also carries the movie perfectly as the villain, Dalton Russel. The movie overall is very good and has many good twists. Pay close attention or you may miss the point.3 out of 4 stars",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Payoff Doesn't Equal Buildup Here, But Still A Solidly Entertaining Mystery","The ""mystery"" genre (and that is exactly what Inside Man is, regardless of its heist/cop trimmings) is often a tricky one to nail. A common problem? For viewers, the setting up of the mystery is often infinitely more engaging than the resolution. That's exactly what happens in this film. Fortunately, it has enough other elements going in its favor to still be quite entertaining.For a very basic overview, Inside Man focuses on a bank robbery perpetuated by Dalton Russell (Clive Owen). When Detective Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) is called to the scene as hostage negotiator, however, he begins to realize that theft may be the furthest thing from Russell's plans. Concurrent to the central mystery is no-nonsense ""fixer"" Madeleine White (Jodie Foster) trying to preserve the shadowy interests of bank owner Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer).The best thing that Inside Man has going for it is that it sets up one whopper of a mystery. One of the best I've ever seen for a non-scifi or fantasy flick. It will immediately pique your interest and keep you guessing on multiple occasions. Much like the detective doing the heavy lifting, you'll become utterly flummoxed by just what the heck Dalton Russell is planning!Of course, a feature film like this has to spill the beans at some point, and when that indeed happens--the house of cards comes tumbling down. The resolution of the intriguing mystery falls considerably flat. That isn't to say that there is no resolution (there most certainly is, and potentially a very interesting one), but director Spike Lee just doesn't quite handle the endgame right. In other words, the journey is far, far more fun than the actual destination. Had that been rectified, this might be a 10/10 star effort.Fortunately, there is enough else to savor in Inside Man that I have no qualms at keeping it a high 8/10. Denzel Washington's repartee with Owen is predictably incredible, and the tension that builds between those two is palpable. The Foster/Plummer angle is also well-acted (of course it is with those two legends cast!), so there is nary a moment on screen that isn't crackling with some type of thespian greatness.I've probably seen Inside Man three times, and each viewing takes basically the same route: I'm utterly engrossed in the mystery and then somewhat put off by the off-balance ending. Overall, then, it ends up being a solid-but-not-spectacular movie that is incredibly engaging mystery-wise and features great acting in every single scene. If you enjoy fast-paced mysteries or are a big Denzel fan, this one is not to be missed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Such awesome potential... wasted   (possible spoiler... i suppose),"Look, Denzel Washington was insanely awesome. Clive Owen was brilliant, and Jodie Foster was Jodie Foster (superb). The premise was excellent, but the writing and directing failed badly. The scenes were sooo slow, and it's not like it had to be, because there was nothing to think about in between. None of the characters have any good motivation, the ending is sketchy, and there is no real satisfaction to be found. If Denzel Washington wasn't so entertaining, I would have fallen asleep; and this is from a serious moviegoer (the newest Pride & Prejudice seemed like a non-stop twist every second thriller in comparison). I wasn't too keen on the meaningless racism with no theme or point either. Crash, this isn't. Props to Denzel (you earn the 6 out of 10 by yourself), Clive, and Jodie.

Decent Crime Thriller,"I saw this movie yesterday, the day it opened here in Tulsa. And on the whole I liked it.But to be honest I'm not entirely sure why.I know most of the critics reviews have been very positive.

It even felt a little long to me.And yet ... do you ever see a movie that seems to have a lot of faults and yet the composite is so much better than the sum of its parts that it works anyway? That's this movie.

You believe these people in their roles become each character acts differently and the cast is so multi-racial its hard not identify with anyone.

Entertaining Heist,"More entertaining than expected and a good intense, yet fun ride throughout. The idea of the perfect heist is always enthralling. The wits of ""good"" versus ""evil""; who will outdo the other - when well written - usually makes good viewing!! The characters of Dalton Russell and Keith Frazier make this a true cat & mouse game in which one is never sure if the mouse is too cool to be caught. Best left to the viewer to determine who is truly the bad-egg.Overall, another stellar performance from Denzel Washington, with great support from Clive Owen and Christopher Plummer. Was somewhat disappointed at Jodie Foster's character and felt that she overdid the cocksure nature of Madeline White. A little too grating and annoying for my liking and far from her best performance(s).The direction is interesting and varied with the typical Spike Lee trademark of the ""moving-non-walking-person"" - however some of the panned shots are nauseating and just that little bit too long.Overall though, a film that should please most who watch it.****** For those who like the heist genre, a strong recommendation would be Jean-Pierre Melville's, ""Le Cercle rouge (1970), starring Alain Delon.

A Cool Bank Heist Thriller with Balls!!!,"It's been a while since I've seen a really good movie and without a doubt, 'Inside Man', fits that bill perfectly.I was half expecting a film in the guise of the Usual Suspects / The Negotiator / Your Usually Run Of The Mill Good Guy Verses Bad Guy Ilk¬Ö But as the various film synopses indicates, not all is what it seems and the multiple twists and counter-twists to this film, although seen before in other films, still manages to retain a sense of originality.However, one thing this film is really great in and, I suppose, adds to its uniqueness if I can put it like that, is that it DOESN'T take itself too seriously. There are plenty of some truly funny moments in this film, which in no way diminishes the tension that runs throughout. In fact, I would describe this film as a Black Comedy / Crime / Mystery / Thriller¬Ö Although there is some drama in this film, to me it was perhaps its weakest point.Not that that is necessarily a bad thing. Be prepared for a mixed bag of goodies, in which most if not all aspects are played out well. The characters are¬Ö well characters aren't really that important in this film save that of Denzel Washington's. He's excellent as the bamboozled detective, always one step behind Clive Owen's cool, calculating and clever 'villain'. But even though you may think this makes him the underdog, it doesn't. Without giving the plot away, rest assured that the good guys win and the 'bad' guys¬Ö. Well¬Ö It's best you checked that out for yourself.As for the other main characters, they do well to keep the movie interesting and moving at a good pace. Jodie puts in an effective performance as a shrewd negotiator, Chiwetel Ejiofor complements Denzel's character well, especially in the humour stakes and Dafoe, although underused in my opinion, does his best as a SWAT operative, which to be honest, doesn't really give him much to play with in this low action flick. But to be honest, action and in depth characterization isn't the main focus of this film. Not that it needs it mind. It's cool, funny, entertaining and does exactly what it says on the tin.As I mentioned earlier with regards to humour, Spike is using some of that dark humour that runs through this film to make his political points. Of course, latent issues of racism are addressed, but don't worry, they're not rammed down your throats and the fact that he's using comedy to, as it were, sweeten the pill, you'll be entertained at least if not informed. Without going into details, be prepared to witness a surreal, bloody hilarious but highly poignant outlook on ultra violent video games and the effect it has on young minds and of course, the post 9-11 sense of paranoia currently in America that seems to indicate that all people from HUGE swaths of the Asian continent, are somehow bomb-wielding suicidal Arabs.Actually, just like is darker, more excessive film 'Bamboozled', Spike seems to be using humour more frequently to make his political points, poke fun at his ultra right-wing bigoted enemies, whilst giving his liberal allies a right laugh. And based on the seeming success of this film, lets hope that this continues.Well done Spike. This film, if nothing else, should at least silence the critics that accuse you of only making films that are serious and / or deal with racial issues¬Ö Actually Spike, you did make a film which tentatively dealt with some of those issues¬Ö You just did it in a thoroughly entertaining way¬Ö BRAVO!!!

Great Fun,"Inside Man (2006)*** 1/2 (out of 4)A man (Clive Owen) robs a bank and a hostage negotiator (Denzel Washington) must find out why he's demands don't make too much sense. When I first heard about this movie I asked myself if we really needed another heist movie but apparently we do because director Spike Lee takes a basic story and takes it in every direction that we don't normally see. There's a mystery lady (Jodie Foster) who shows up and her secret, as well as the robber's secret, really make this a very interesting film. I was a little caught off guard at first on how Lee was showing clips from the aftermath but in the end these worked perfectly well. I liked the fact that this really wasn't like any other heist film I had seen, although, in funny fashion, Lee does wink at other films in the genre including one joke in regards to Dog Day Afternoon. Owen and Washington do excellent work and the scenes of them together are quite good as we see two great actors trying to out act one another. Lee manages to sneak in various messages about race as well as other political issues but he does these very nicely without then taking over the actual story.

At first, you want the movie to end because of this, but then Lee grabs your attention again, and when the movie is over you are left wanting for more; it doesn't matter what kind of film it is.""Inside Man"" starts off with the incomparable face of Clive Owen, as he gives a superb introductory narration. The camera shows his face and we can see constant changes of light and movement in the background, apparently a brick wall. This speech demands your attention and you should listen because, even when ""Inside Man"" is a thriller with all the basic elements, it contains a little more.When the speech's over, we go to some classic Lee shots of Manhattan (quick changing cuts courtesy of Lee's frequent editor Barry Alexander Brown); reminding us how good he is at depicting the location's mood, either with a statue, a building or just the American flag. You should take this time, while the main credits roll, to try and remember what Owen said; because after 'directed by Spike Lee', everything moves at high speed.There's a bank robbery, detective Frazier (Denzel Washington) and his partner (Chiwetel Ejiofor) are assigned to the case, they encounter Captain Darius (Willen Dafoe) and suddenly people start coming in and out of places without a pause; including hostages inside the bank. Owen says in his speech that he's planned the perfect robbery, and it sure looks like it; but that's all I can say.The pace of the images was a wise choice by Lee to really get the viewer into the film, and this aspect works all the way through. The problem, however, comes with the words. The screenplay is, surprisingly, original. Writer Russell Gewirtz is the guy who's written the script that will probably get DeNiro and Pacino together again: that's something. His work for this film is also something, with an unexpected amount of cleverness for the simplicity his premise has. It's contradictory, but in the good way; with some innovation but never forgetting the 'thriller' essence.But what's admirable about Gewirtz' writing is that he doesn't try to play the viewer (like ""Derailed"", recently, also with Owen); he lays out the results with honesty and professionalism. Maybe this aspect sounds strange but, although people like being tricked, there's a good way to do it and I'm getting tired of no one doing it right. On the other hand, not tricking could be even better than tricking well, if you follow.Now follow Denzel Washington's work during this decade; virtually every role he's played involves carrying a gun (you should check his whole career, he's got a good relationship with the weapon). I love Denzel Washington, I really do; and that's why I've tolerated most of the crappy things he's been doing. Also because he's always good in them, just that¬ÖGood. But I've got news for you: his portrayal here is the best since his last Oscar for ""Training Day"", where he also played a man of the law. I could easily say that Denzel Washington is the only megastar today who delivers good performances and also has a lot of fun. You can see him excel here; comfortable, all over the place, even more solid than in his directorial debut: ""Antwone Fisher"".Another thing I could easily say is that Washington plays a similar line of characters; always ending up triumphant, and Clive Owen is the same. He does it again here, and he doesn't have to show his haunting face to triumph. And Jodie Foster's character, well¬ÖYou see, she appears on screen, being the megastar she is; and I don't know how she manages to make us think she's a normal person. That's something megastar Denzel Washington hasn't achieved in a long time.The fact remains that, among all the polished though not great word, Lee's influence is still there, everywhere. His feelings are not left out in this action-packed piece; and you get all this little moments where you stop doubting that this thriller is 'a Spike Lee joint'.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Perfect insight,"Spike Lee's Inside Man may seem like just another cop and robber story until you see the story unravel on screen. Robber Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) has planned a perfect heist that has put career cop Keith Frazier in a fix. Amidst intense negotiation between the two, power broker Madeline White (Jodie Foster) enters the picture proving herself to be a better negotiator than Fraizer. But everyone has their motives and the interlocking puzzle gets more complex. As the story unfolds, each turn becomes more unpredictable.Clive Owen is excellent witty robber who's outpacing everyone at every opportunity. Displaying a level of cool collectedness, Owen was convincing as the potentially violent criminal with a broader agenda in mind.Denzel Washington turns in an equally sublime performance playing the detective who's trying to serve justice while battling investigation for corruption. Detecive Fraizer's urgency in taking Russell to task is well portrayed by Washington.Jodie Foster's Medeline White may just play a supporting role but it's no doubt that the actress can handle any role with aplomb. Her character's brimming with calm confidence trying to secure a deal with the robber while enriching her own pockets.Spike Lee's Inside Man is an exciting thrillers with non-stop action and suspense. It cleverly plays out and eventually leaves the audience dazzled and in awe. (A)",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Haven't seen too many Spike films. But I'm sure he's done better...,"Overall, I would've rather spent the time watching something else. I really enjoy watching Denzel do his thing in front of the camera. But he didn't have the magic like I saw in Man on Fire. Maybe it wasn't him. Possibly, it was direction. I could really see him being left to figure out this character on his own. That's all well and good. He has his trademark style. And it does work. I think Tony was able to bring something extra out in him though. I felt like Jodi was there to give her lines and pick up a check. I love Chris Plummer. But I found him far more entertaining as a Klingon... Storywise, I thought it was good. The edit though just had it jumping back and forth. And ultimately, I felt that the cut was the biggest let down... Plot holes abound, anyone could easily infer what was missing... Music? I was confused. Where was Sean? I kept feeling like I was supposed to be watching a James Bond film. Listen to it again. Straight out of a Bond flick, w/ the exception of the occasional gangster tones and brass. Either way, the images didn't live up to the grandeur of the soundtrack... Technically, it was okay. I felt like the cameraman was playing around w/ too many looks. They were nice. But they were never consistent. Too many buzzed shots. Sound and post audio were fine. The transfer looked fine. Art was great.All in all, just not my movie. Plenty of people liked it. And that must mean that the film hit its mark. But all movies aren't made for all people.Just my two cents.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Spike Lee talks about what we see and (especially) about we don't see,"INSIDE MAN is a two-way experience, working on very different levels that complete each other. First, it is a heist movie in its classical form, with the bank robber wanting to execute the perfect crime whereas the hard-working policeman tries to catch him. However, there's more in this excellent film from Spike Lee than meets the eye.Lee and the extremely well-written screenplay fill the bank robbery with clever metaphors and comments on the situation of American society right now, moving from Sept 11th (which was also very present in the previous film by the director, the spectacular THE 25TH HOUR) to the quality of 50cent songs. Enter Jodie Foster, in a little but shining role that has the juiciest part of the cunning remarks Lee and the script make on the situation of America nowadays.However, there's no better symbol used by the director than the one of the bank robbery itself, which makes us harder to see who the bad guy really is, and watching the scenes in which it is hard to tell who the thieves are and who the hostages are, it is hard not to think of the search for people to blame.Thematically rich, INSIDE MAN reminds me of the also brilliant A HISTORY VIOLENCE, since it seems to be talking about one thing when in fact has other plans for the audience. At least those who want to read between the lines. And having a cast of such quality (Jodie, Denzel, Clive Owen - even if he wears a mask almost the whole film, Christopher Plummer throwing in the mud his THE SOUND OF MUSIC days - you'll see why - Willem Dafoe, Chiwetel Ejiofor) certainly doesn't hurt.INSIDE MAN is a two-way experience. But no matter if you see it as a simple 'bank robbery movie' or as more than that, it is a very rewarding experience.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
An 8 wanting to be a 9.,"As Denzel Washington films go, it's close - but not quite. It hits some high notes and it manages to hold your attention and inquisitiveness. The acting from its first-class cast gives the film dimension enough to keep you guessing. Not normally a Clive Owen fan, but I enjoyed his calm and almost menacing performance in this. Jodie Foster is sassy and plays her cards perfectly. Christopher Plummer; needless say more. I enjoyed the theme.

Too much humor...,"This movie had a great story and great actors, but I'm somewhat disappointed with the directing.Inside Man is a great thriller with lots of twists and turns to keep you guessing and the ending is great but I feel that the constant wise cracks and jokes were a bit out of place. Don't get me wrong the jokes were funny and most of them made me laugh but in the end it made this film way less immersive. It felt like Spike Lee was behind that camera constantly wise-cracking, you know kinda like that guy at a party that always wants to be the ""funny guy"" and then everyone gets sick of him and wants him to shut up :P (well not that bad hehe).

New Twists On Old Ideas,"'Inside Man', the new Spike Lee film starring Denzel Washington, Jody Foster, Clive Owen and Willem Dafoe, adds new twists on old ideas. Overall, it is an entertaining bank heist film.The actors played their roles by the book. The real credit here goes to Spike Lee. He adds mystique to the story by incorporating post heist hostage interrogations throughout the film. In doing so, he reveals a plot point that ordinarily would act as a spoiler but instead plays well into the drama.Aside from the bank robbers, there is an additional character with a nefarious past that has an interest in the goings on. This was the only real disappointment for me. The nature of his past initially seems as though it will be the emphasis for more conflict but it never comes to pass. Even though there is an implied resolution, that particular storyline falls flat. It would, however, be fodder for a sequel.The most intriguing component here is Jody Foster's character. She plays a sort of back-channel power broker. I couldn't help wondering if there is really a broad enough market out there for the type of service this character offers. Ms. Foster did well enough in the role, wearing a Bruce Willis type smirk through many of her lines. But the character is interesting enough to carry an entire film.If you like the bank robber genre, this film is worth seeing.Grade: B",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"A rare, intelligent movie","It is like ""Do the Right Thing"" meets ""Dog Day Afternoon"" meets ""Mission Impossible"" meets Alfred Hitchcock. Unlike MI, however, the many fast-paced plot twists and turns make sense. There are pauses for social lessons as Spike Lee can deliver them. The cinematographer takes our eyes on an architecture tour of exteriors and interiors. Denzel Washington is superb as a underpaid, middle-level detective with enough sense to know that he is being conned all the way around, by his city as well as the ""perps."" Clive Owen is fascinating as the cool and cerebral mastermind. Memorable performances by Jodie Foster and Christopher Plummer, too, as steely cool aristocrats. The plot structure is made more complex with flash-forwards, but they can be followed. We never find out how this plot came to be hatched, but we can surmise when we discover all the conspirators. By all rights, this film should be rewarded next year as Crash was rewarded for teaching about race relations. We'll see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Another great Denzel Washington movie!,"I thought the movie was great. It has action packed moments with a little added humor every now and then.

And Clive Owen was AMAZING! I haven't seen him in many movies, but this one is by far the best one of his movies i have seen. He plays a very intriguing character.

A new Dog Day Afternoon with a clever twist,"Unfortunately, my generation did not have Dog Day Afternoon, nore did most of them get the full effect, it's a terrific movie. When I saw the theatrical trailer for this in the theater, I just thought it was another crappy remake that some amateur director thought he could do a better job of a priceless and flawless classic.Inside Man was surprisingly another terrific heist film that had some really good twists in it. It is like a new version of Dog Day Afternoon, not to mention it has an honorary citation in there. The acting is terrific and it keeps you going into the next scene after another. I loved how it wasn't typical and it had like a new attitude to it in this world of typical action movies.I would highly recommend Inside Man, it's a great action heist movie that could grab anyone. And to my generation who hasn't seen Dog Day Afternoon, please go out and rent that as well.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A safe bet for any fan of the genre or cast,"I think Inside Man hit all the right notes. It's essentially a standard hostage situation thriller, but just really well done. There are a couple surprises in the plot department, but it's nothing too absurd. As Jodie Foster's character jokes, there aren't really nuclear missile launch codes sitting in one of the bank safety deposit boxes.The film opens the same way I think the trailer did. Clive Owen stares rather intensely into the camera and gets our full attention. He's becoming one of my favorite actors. But he and a few others stage what is to be the perfect bank robbery. He has a plan for everything. What he doesn't expect is someone as smart as him on the outside. That would be Denzel Washington, who plays a detective arriving on the scene as the lead hostage negotiator. I believe I heard that Washington put on weight for the role, to look more like an ordinary guy. He wasn't though. Despite facing charges for some missing evidence, he's a rather exceptional detective and is a worthy adversary for Clive Owen's extremely calm bank robber. Jodie Foster enters the picture as well as... well, I have no idea whatsoever what she does. She specializes in protecting people's interests I guess. This would include the owner of the bank under siege (Christopher Plummer), who has something inside that he doesn't want the thieves to stumble upon.I love the cast. In addition to who I already mentioned, you have Willem Dafoe as the head of the SWAT team and Chiwetel Ejiofor (who I'll always know as the operative from Serenity) as Washington's fellow detective. And despite how annoyed I am with Spike Lee over that ridiculous Spike TV situation, he's crafted quite a good film here. The movie is quite clever, but it never goes over the top, and it doesn't dance around with pride over how clever it is. There's a genuine sense of realism pumped into every scene, and I think that's the director's most prominent signature here. Nothing truly great or groundbreaking going on with the film, but it's a safe bet if you want an enjoyable film, and I especially enjoyed the performances of all 6 leads.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"""My name is Dalton Russell....""","The Joe Cool Review: Inside Man(2006)Starring: Denzel Washington as Detective Keith Frazier, Clive Owen as Dalton Russell, Jodie Foster as Madeline White, Christopher Plummer as Arthur Case, and Willem Dafoe as Captain John DariusPlot: His name is Dalton Russell. Pay strict attention to what he says because he chooses his words carefully and never repeats himself. Recently he planned and set in motion events to execute the perfect bank robbery..why? Because he can. So now Detective Keith Frazier has to talk him into releasing the hostages, but there may be other matters involved that may hinder that process.Openers: When I saw the casting and premise, I was very excited to see this movie. I'd been a fan of Denzel for several years, and in my mind he's one of the best actors around. Clive Owen I became a fan of after Sin City, and Willem Dafoe was awesome in Spiderman and The Boondock Saints. So I looked at this all-star cast, great trailer and expected to be blown away..was I? Read on...The Good: For the most part, this was a perfect heist movie. There were plenty of twists and turns and while some of them were predictable, others weren't and so the suspense was still there. You sympathized with the bad guy as much as you did the police trying to bring him down. Maybe that's just because both Denzel and Clive do such a good job in their roles, but it was a solid ride throughout that had me eventually wanting both guys to come out okay. Clive Owen does a great job as the leader of the heist, his arrogance is just so great you can't help but like him. ""I'm going walk out the front door of this bank."" And in a supporting role, Willem Dafoe is the glue that holds this together. He doesn't do much in this role but he's good where he is. Christopher Plummer is good as the owner of the bank, Arthur Case.The Bad: I noticed Spike Lee tried to comment on racism with this movie. I appreciate the effort Spike but it's really not needed here. Sure we know that middle-eastern looking people are subject to discrimination since 9/11 and we know that racism in general still exists. They just seemed like trivial segments that didn't actually go anywhere so they were just pointless. Also, as much as Jodie Foster is a good actress, her character was not needed here. Another pointless role. In the end she adds nothing to the overall story and doesn't detract from it either, she's just there.The Ugly: Random reference to a PSP game(50 Cent's Bulletproof) had me cracking up unintentionally. Seriously, does 50 actually make his victims eat grenades in that game? Final Verdict: It has a few hiccups here and there but overall Inside Man is one of the year's top films. It's a great heist move and if you love movies like Heat you'll love this. With an all-star cast and great plot there's no reason you shouldn't check this out immediately.Rating: ****1/2 of *****",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A crime film that will have you cheering for the bank robbers,"Let me start off by saying I am not a Spike Lee fan. That said, this is not your average Spike Lee movie.The premise off the movie is a group of bank robbers led by Clive Owen under the alias of different versions of the name ""steve"" pull off a bank heist taking hostages. Denzel Washington comes to save the day as the chief negotiator who is under review for some embezzlement issues. The usually smart criminal throws the dumb cops on several wild goose chases scenario plays out in full, but is beefed up with an extra storyline including Jodie Foster and Christopher Plummer.Although the movie is smart it just fails on every single level. Not once was I able to take the police officers seriously because they were all making painstakingly stupid decisions and Denzel's incurious cop persona.The composer from the music must suffer from a form of ADD. The music leaps genres in a matter of cuts and takes you completely out of the movie experience.The last complaint is the ending. The movie just drags way too long in the end and when you finally reach the conclusion it isn't baffling at all. You knew it would happen. You knew it a mile away because that is the only smart way to end this dragged out mess of things.The plus side of the movie is that Clive Owen and the bank robbers are highly enjoyable to watch. Its fun to see how they work and how they treat all the hostages. Maybe thats sick of me, but when Denzel keeps cracking out stupid jokes and all his cohorts force acting their laughs watching Clive Owen bully people around is far cooler.Congrats Spike Lee and Denzel Washington. You both continue to be overrated artists.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Probably Spike Lee's Best,"Inside Man definitely was a well thought out piece of work. This was no obvious, dumbed down crime mystery. The movie as well as the bank robbery the movie was about was near genius. The acting was excellent as can be expected from Denzel Washington and Jodie Foster, but Clive Owen was not to be outdone either. This movie held my attention every step of the way. I didn't want to miss a word, a clue, a single gesture so as not to be left behind. I was thinking about the movie and discussing it well after it was over; the tell-tell sign of a good movie.Spike Lee did an excellent job with this one. In fact, minus a few Spike Lee-isms, I would not have guessed that he was the director. He did throw in the gratuitous person-moving-on-a-trolley to simulate walking, and he also had music that didn't seem to quite fit in certain scenes.

Definitely not up to par with other Spike Lee movies...,"Three story lines and not enough tying them together, ""Inside Man"" was very jumpy and an incomplete attempt to be artistic and realistic. Though having its moments, the movie started off looking like a fast thriller which quickly grounded to a slow crawl, jumped quickly between highs and lows, and only barely picked up steam again near the last 20 minutes. I will give credit to Denzel Washington, he played his part extremely well with a full grasp of his human side and not just the typical ""super-detective"" with all the answers. Clive Owen also did quite well with his duality part as ""evil genius"" and ""criminal mastermind"" (both not the same in retrospect). Overall though, each person individually created a great sub-section. Yet, when the parts finally came together and everything counted, there was no sudden ""ah-ha!"" or summation of everything. It all ended up with very little of the energy it began with, with a lot of plot-holes, tons of questions, and as I said earlier, no where near Spike Lee's normal level.

What a really surprising movie,"This is a movie that never ceases to surprise the spectators, leading them to expect a somewhat different bank robbery but, a bank robbery anyway. This is the merit of the screenplay and ho the events and information are brought to us from the beginning up to the last scene of the film. Together with the mastery of the film making, this makes a superb entertaining movie with several subjects that really give substance to the characters and, in an easy approach, take you to several key points: The relationship between a big banker fortune and the opportunity the second world war provided by the NAZI holocaust of the JEWS and subsequent robber of their possessions. In this particular case, the Banker was a friend of the Jew colleague that was put to death, that he could have prevented but chose not no, keeping the jewels of his friend (and his money). How the past came looking for this Banker, but, surprisingly, in a very different look: not the pure revenge on a war criminal but disclosing him as such and getting rich in the process, not by robbing bank notes but famous and much valuable jewels. Good and evil are here relative: the good ones get rich after an extraordinary well designed robbery, the cop gets a promotion and receives a gift from the robber that understood how this cop loved. The Banker uses power to use a Broker specialist in helping cloudy business people doing their businesses and the city Mayor who has to pay some favors, in order to wash away the object of the assault. Good and Evil, crime and punishment: not in this movie. The film lives fully on the story and does not reach the past except for the Banker to acknowledge the robber information on him. No flashbacks, waiting for the next event, some clues on the nature of the gang leader, some comic pieces coming out of the Albanian speech, the Albanian girl and some corruption disclosed when at the Embassy someone wanted money to do a translation. Denzel Washington working fine his character between his personal side and his professional side, Clive Owen a surprising robber creating the faked environment for us and for the police.

They don't make like they used to.,Only directors like Spike Lee can tell a story in such a way that there aren't words to describe the way he can draw you into the story and mesmerize you with his style.

"Suspenseful, yet very inconsistent.","Spike Lee creates one of the most unique and interesting heist movies in recent memory with Inside Man, the story about a group of robbers led by Clive Owen that hold up a bank for all different reasons. The first half hour or so is pretty intense and interesting as we watch these four robbers force all the hostages to dress up exactly like them for a crucial reason later in the story. Denzel Washington plays a hostage negotiator trying to get the robbers to cooperate, yet he seems like such a weak character when he should dominate the screen. That role goes to Owen, who is so convincing as an unflinching bad guy as well as being very interesting so we actually care about what he is going to do next. Jodie Foster plays a ""fixer"" trying to help Christopher Plummer get something of great value inside the bank. Unfortunately, that is all we learn of her. What fails mostly with Inside Man is the confusing storyline Spike Lee throws at us. He mixes in post-hostage footage with actual hostage footage, and soon it becomes confusing which is which and what came first. There are too many little revelations at the end instead of one big one. The acting is mostly good, especially by Owen, and the rest of the script is well done. But, Lee could have stayed more consistent and suspenseful. Instead, at the end, it doesn't feel as intense or satisfying as even Ocean's 11.

But Spike Lee and team give a a completely new take on that story. Like most movies, we look for the ""good guy"" and the ""bad guy,"" but it's not immediately obvious here.

Also, the other key players - Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster and Christopher Plummer were amazing as well.Not only was it suspenseful, well thought out and fascinating - it was also quite witty.

Potentially great thriller gets lost amid an aimless civics lesson,"In Jan De Bont's 1994 action extravaganza ""Speed,"" he pitted Keanu Reeves and a busload of ethnic/social/economic stereotypes against a mad bomber (Dennis Hopper); it was a taut, intense, and breezily implausible ride that didn't leave the viewer pondering much afterward. On initial glance, Spike Lee's ""Inside Man"" is another concoction in the mold of De Bont's film, but is undermined by the director's unleashed tendency to prod us with a civics lesson. While this is the kind of thing you expect from a glorified After-School Special like ""Crash,"" it does not help along an alleged thriller...as a matter of fact, every time Lee brings a new ethnic stereotype into the fray, the film comes to a screeching halt because his technique is so heavy-handed (the racist patrolman; the busty Albanian translator; the Muslim who natters endlessly about his turban). The result is a film of diffused intensity through and through--which is a shame, because its setup promises something very cool: Clive Owen plays a crafty extortionist who takes over a branch of a Manhattan bank with his masked, hooded partners; bank head Christopher Plummer is extremely concerned about the contents of a safe-deposit box inside; Jodie Foster is enlisted as an impartial 'fixer' to negotiate things with Owen. Meanwhile, Denzel Washington reprises his 'flawed-yet-resourceful cop' role, trying to figure out Owen's motivation...which, to the film's credit, is unique. The leads turn in good--if rather typical--performances, and the cinematography puts us within the action very well...but ""Inside Man""'s suspense is constantly thwarted by a manufactured look and some of the most artificial supporting characters ever put on-screen. That, and Lee's aforementioned perpetuating of the racial divide at the expense of story and thrills...well, it makes one long for the summer of '94, when ""Speed"" delivered entertaining action, sans a political agenda.5.5 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
So far one of 2006's best...,"Show of hands - who here loves heist movies where thieves are doing their very best to pull off the perfect robbery? Well good news - Inside Man is one of the best of the genre to come along in quite some time.What I love most about the movie is the air of mystery that surrounds it and its characters for the entire runtime. Nobody's true motivations are immediately revealed, and it's our job to follow along as everything plays out. And I recommend that as you follow along you pay careful attention to all the characters from the very beginning. You could start to get the hostages and bank robbers confused. But let's get back to our mysterious main characters...You've got Clive Owen - the calm and collected ringleader who has strategically planned this robbery to the smallest detail. He really doesn't seem to be that bad of a guy at heart. He doesn't want to hurt anybody, but he has a job to do and he has to make sure everyone realizes that he's not messing around. He simply must establish that they're not smarter than he is. Who is he and exactly what is his motivation?Then there's Denzel Washington. He's a newly promoted detective whose girlfriend is ready for a ring, but at the moment he has a few hostages in the bank that concern him. But how innocent is he? He's currently surrounded by a corruption scandal involving a missing $140,000 and this could play to his disadvantage regardless of whether he's innocent or not.And what on earth is up with Jodie Foster and her uppity little self? Ever a total wainch (it's a Southern term my friends and I invented, you probably get the gist), she is obviously very skilled in hitting guys where it hurts, and no, I don't mean the pocketbook. She's a mysterious power broker who knows how to keep her ""clients"" happy.Her most recent client is Christopher Plummer who just so happens to own the bank that is being robbed. He is really interested in only one thing - the contents of a particular safety deposit box. He wants Jodie to retrieve these contents or make sure they're destroyed. What exactly is he trying to hide?Don't go into the movie looking for a rapid fire action thriller. Inside Man's pace is more deliberate, allowing for gradual character and story development. That's a hard thing to find in a two hour movie these days, but here's an example of how to pull it off. The dialogue is smart and funny, the characters demonstrate believable chemistry, and the script is cleverly written. There may not be any plot twists of Sixth Sense proportions, but it keeps you guessing and manages to serve up a couple of surprises along the way.To say any more would be a risk of revealing too much, so just go enjoy the movie. But you need to be prepared to immerse yourself for a full two hours. If you're even the slightest fan of heist thrillers then check out Inside Man and find out exactly why ""respect is the ultimate currency.""",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Why weren't they caught?,"May contain spoilers...I like Clive Owen a lot, a Jodie Foster even more. And these things kept me biased throughout the movie. Not that i wouldn't have wanted it to be the perfect bank robbery, but i couldn't help thinking why didn't the police dig deeper into the backgrounds of all the people involved with it. It is unlikely that the ones involved would have had an account with the bank and if they did, some or the other employees would remember them. This could be a way to filter out the accomplices. And also would have been the first the first thing i would have done in Denzel Washington's shoes. Nevertheless, (sort of) heist movies are dear to me, and its good to see something novel coming out of this genre when you are thinking every possible crook-ery has been tried out!!!",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
An Underrated film,"Even with a good score this film is undervalued. It's a slick film with a highly competent cast. Everyone involved plays their parts to perfection in a heist film with a clever premise and a flawless execution.Jodie Foster was probably playing my favourite character, but that's a tough pick out of an inspired cast. Clive Owen and Denzel of course also steal the show both individually and in how they play off each other",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Feeling Sided.,"More cool than good, ""Inside Man"" gives itself way too much credit. The movie wants to be smart and have as many twists and turns as a large plate of spaghetti, but ultimately the means to get to the point are never fully justified. Troubled police officer Denzel Washington and partner Chiwetel Ejiofor immediately get thrown into the middle of a bank robbery in Manhattan where hostages have been taken. The bank job is led by a cold and calculating sociopath (Clive Owen) who apparently has more motivation than just money. Bank owner Christopher Plummer is mysterious and seems to hold a secret that is at the deepest heart of the production. He hires a cutthroat business negotiator/cover-up artist (Jodie Foster) in the hopes of keeping his secret from the public. Clashes aplenty between Washington and all the other key players (SWAT captain Willem Dafoe included) come at the audience in heavy doses. Washington is the heat here and Owen is the ice. Time elements are jumbled with flash-forwards that add to the complicated puzzle that is the plot. Spike Lee proves that he can go mainstream and does come up with one his better movies of recent memory (I have always felt Lee is somewhat overrated), but ""Inside Man"" has plot holes galore and if you think about it too long you will realize that you had a lot more fun watching the setup than you had experiencing the payoff. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Too obvious,"I like Jodie Foster. I like Denzel Washington. This movie had promise, and I was really disappointed when it did not live up to that promise. Sorry guys. There may be New York City funny things that I missed because I don't live there, but ""in"" jokes don't make a movie good as a whole.The end was pretty obvious about 1/3 of the way through. And the ending wasn't much fun, either. Yes, everything is wrapped up, and everybody knows who did what, but there is no satisfaction, and no punch either.The movie was OK entertainment, though most of the vulgarity was gratuitous and you can thank Spike for that. I got the DVD free from the library, so I'm only out my time. Don't spend more than $3 to rent it.Everything in this movie has been used in other movies and/or stories before. Go see Collateral if you want something more exciting and well-made, though not as morally satisfying.It's possible that if I watched it a second time I might pick up on nuances that I missed the first time.

Excellent Film.,"Now this movie was right on the money. As a retired NYPD Detective, I found it very accurate as to the goings on. Especially when Willem DeFoe as the ESU Captain discusses the situation with Mr. Washington. I have been in some situations like this and the actions were very true to life, however, I saw one problem. Although Mr. Washington was a hostage negotiator and a Detective, he wouldn't have been able to order Sgts and supervisors the way he does in this movie. Mr. Spike Lee has been watching how the NYPD operates. The story was unusual but interesting throughout. Mr. Plummer plays a great part as well, and to tell you how he is involved would give up the plot somewhat. As the movie unravels, one can actually start to understand what is happening, to a point. Mr. Washington plays the part well, and his supervisors are confident to a point. The character Mr. Washington plays is up against a wall throughout this movie, which makes for great suspense. A lot of twists and turns, but the final product works.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"Smart heist flick, with great acting performances.

Escape from the bank seems impossible, being surrounded by the entire New York police force. How will he be able to find a way to escape from the bank? That's the great million dollar question!And that suspense is managed very effectively, because you keep guessing till the very end HOW Clive Owen will get away with a seemingly impossible bank heist.Terrific actors: Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster, Clive Owen and Christopher Plummer.

Lee-Lite but still a damn fine movie all the same - 75%,"Being new to the work of Spike Lee, I do feel like someone who has turned up late to someone else's party. Like all movie fans, I was aware of his influence and importance to modern cinema but maybe I was scared off in some way - being a white English guy probably moved me out of his target audience. Thankfully, Lee decided to give us his most mass-appeal movie yet so the uninitiated like me can admire his work and trust me, I do admire this. A twisting and thrilling heist movie with brains to match, ""Inside Man"" could well be a contender for the most under-rated movie since ""Road To Perdition"".Clive Owen plays Dalton Russell, a master criminal who openly brags about planning the perfect bank robbery. At first, his plan works brilliantly - his gang commandeer the bank with ease and he sets his plan in motion. But it's not long before the cops arrive, led by Detectives Frazier (Denzel Washington) and Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who become ever-more determined to end the siege of the bank as the hostage crisis escalates. But it isn't as straight forward as that - the bank's owner Arthur Case (veteran Christopher Plummer) has some secrets buried deep in the vault and hires the mysterious Madeleine White (Jodie Foster). Has Russell pulled off the perfect heist or can the cops stop him?Absorbing and beautifully shot, ""Inside Man"" shows a film-maker of real class at work. Everything from the quality of the performances (Plummer is simply great to watch) to the perfect subtlety of the soundtrack illustrates exactly how a film should look, sound and feel. Lee even manages to find time to squeeze a little humour from his stellar cast whilst simultaneously making some points on the nature of violence, racial tension and greed. Where I do feel ""Inside Man"" comes undone is the final act where I found my belief in the story tested as credibility is stretched too far. There were too many unanswered questions for me in the end, I thought, and it left me feeling curiously unsatisfied. I did feel as though I'd watched a lesson in film-making from a master of the art but maybe the tale was too convoluted to be told successfully.It's a pity that ""Inside Man"" loses its way towards the end because I can't recall the last time I was so impressed with a film. It draws you into its multi-layered story and doesn't let go for an instant. It is - rejoice - a taunt and tense thriller that actually delivers. If you wish to see how film-making should be done then I suggest you check this out. Ignore the 15-rating, though - the language is strong and frequent but assuming these things don't matter to you, I would happily recommend this utterly absorbing movie.

One of the worse movies I've seen in recent years. Simple awful.,"Where to begin? Well, the best part of the film is the A.R. Rahman song that plays throughout the introduction and credits. It is simply superb. From there, the movie slides downhill rapidly. The dialog is gratuitously laced with 4 letters words, dull and implausible. Everyone is compelled to be vulgar in this poorly made movie. We have the usual pointing out of post-9/11 bigotry and abuse of 'people of color'. The big-name actors performances are wooden, stilted. ALL of them. And, a few of those big names CAN act. They just are not inspired to do so in this bomb. The direction is mediocre throughout and often poor. It reveals how Spike Lee is a 'made man' in Hollywood who can seemingly do no wrong even while producing pot-boilers such as this. The musical score we are tortured with throughout the film is one of the worst I've heard in any move, anytime. Terence Blanchard hasn't a clue as to how match the score to what's going on during the film. Honestly, this score is embarrassingly bad. My wife asked me how the movie could be released with such trite, canned music. I guessed correctly that the composer must be a friend of Lee's. Really---the musical score is atrocious. I humbly ask Blanchard to watch any episode of Lost Season 1 or Field of Dreams to learn what GREAT music can do to enhance a film. I could go on and on and say more. This film isn't worth watching and it isn't worth writing about. Really. It is THAT bad.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Very Entertaining Heist Film,"All in all this movie was thoroughly entertaining. The heist plan was very ingenious, most of the main actors turned in great performances (particularly Denzel and Owens), the soundtrack was great and the movie was genuinely funny at times. In the age of the ten dollar movie, this was totally worth the money.That being said, there were a few things that knocked this movie down a few points. Firstly, some of the dialogue sounded very forced and unnatural (but surprisingly this only seemed to happen in the first half of the movie). Secondly, some of the ethnic characters which Spike Lee used in an attempt to show the true spirit of New York were clich√©d at best and stereotypical at worst. Thirdly, the second half of the movie also seemed to be more interesting visually as Spike Lee employed some interesting camera work to give the movie a slightly different feel. Although the camera work in the first half was pretty solid, the movie could have been even better had Lee used some of this innovative camera work throughout the whole thing.Anyway, the bottom line is, go see this movie, you'll certainly be entertained and it'll definitely be worth the ten bucks.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"""Get Ready To Root For The Bad Guy""","Detective Frazier, is one tough cop who is too smart for his job. Dalton Russell is a bank robber, who planned the perfect bank robbery. Hostages are at stake and Frazier needs to get them out. When an unexpected guest arrives, Madaline White, Frazier begins to believe that there is more to this heist then just the money.A Spike Lee Joint, one of his better joints if you ask me. Leaving his ""pro black, con white"" message in his past, Lee has made an entertaining heist film that makes you side with the bad guy just because he is cool. Right from the get-go Owen tells you the What, Why, Where, When and eventually the How on the perfect bank robbery. Hearing this, you get the impression that he will be successful in this attempt. I'm not going to tell you whether he is or isn't, but throughout the entire movie, even though you might not want to, you can't help but cheer for Owen to get away with it in the end.While viewing the trailer, one gets the impression that Inside Man is more then just a normal heist flick and it is. It's difficult to go into an explanation of the plot without giving some bits of it away, as I've probably already have done for some. The plot of the film is interesting, although some may be expecting a bigger pay-off in the end, Inside Man does deliver the twists and turns, just not as big as some may suspect.Lee throws in his usual character has a racist moment as he does with virtually every film he does. He also manages to have fun with the time line and give us some testimonies of the survivors, it manages to flow well with the film. Here Lee is able to keep up with what's on the screen. He makes the plot follow along smoothly, up until the end though, where the film unexpectedly goes on and on dragging the viewer with it. It has to have that clich√©d ending where the detective realizes what has just happened.The performances are top-notch. Washington delivers us another great performance as the tough cop who seems to catch on to the scheme quicker then others. Jodie Foster gives a good performance with what little she has, even if her character has no background information what so ever as to what she does or who she is. She just happens to be there and with connections. Clive Owen is great as the bad guy, even if his face is covered for 3/4 of the film. He is so cool and sly as the villain that you end up rooting for him, knowing that it's the wrong thing to do. William Dafoe rounds out the supporting cast and along with Foster, doesn't have much screen time. This is forgivable because Washington and Owen are so good on the screen that you wish the story would stick with them.Inside Man begins as an action thriller and takes a quick turn to something a little bit more sophisticated, once we get inside the bank with our captives. The film itself will make you want to try and plan your own ""perfect robbery"". Lee gives us a great heist film that I'm sure will be mentioned with the best of them. If Inside Man was a bit shorter...such as cutting out some ""digging hole"" scenes and a better wrap up, then it could have qualified for an early start to one of the year's best films. But for now it can just stay as being an entertaining heist flick....oh yeah, get ready to root for the bad guy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Pretty dull, but above average","For me Inside Man was just not what it was cracked up to be. Great cast, great characters (especially Owen's and Foster's) and the film is technically sound. But the script stretches it's smartness and the film becomes dull because of it.I like filmmakers with opinions and Lee's no exception for me. I like the references to the current 'war on terror'. All hostages are suspects (like all muslims). How do you distinguish the good from the few bad? Especially the scene where all hostage are gunned down in front of the bank with rubber bullets hit home.But I still feel Lee didn't get the max out of this film and his cast. The scenes between Foster and Washington are fantastic and Owen gives a solid performance as always (though his American accent is very bad). But it just isn't enough.So, it's solid entertainment, but I hoped for more.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A Keep-em-Guessing Thriller that Actually Works!,"Hoo boy, I really liked this movie! Witty, intelligent, well-acted, well-written, cleverly planned, what a great film. The writers did a brilliant job, and Spike Lee did a brilliant job bringing their idea to the screen.This is so much more than just an elaborate, twisty-turny crime drama. There is so much to like here, from terrific dialog to spots of terror to political intrigue.For several years now Spike Lee has evolved from a ""ghetto filmmaker"" to a true icon of film. This film, along with ""25th Hour"" a few years back, prove that he has the ability to reach across all lines of society and make something with mass appeal. I was in a theater with a large cross-sampling of ethnicities and ages, and EVERYONE loved this film. One minute the theater is laughing with the lines, the next everyone's holding their breath, wondering what happens next.This is also Denzel Washington at his finest. His delivery is impeccable here.My only beefs are with the film score (the opening music was brilliant, but occasionally the music didn't set the right mood for the scene), and the somewhat miscast Jodie Foster (whom I love in virtually everything else she's ever done). She played her role admirably, but I don't think she was the proper person for that part.I have to give it 10 out of 10. I thought it was brilliant.Barky",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Above average heist movie, but flawed","Inside Man tries hard to be a smart, thinking man's heist movie. It does contain some clever ideas, but it has enough flaws that it does not leave you completely satisfied on further reflection, the way a truly brilliant bank robbery film would.Much of the plot centers on a cat and mouse game between Detective Frazier (Denzel Washington) and Dalton Russell (Clive Owen). Russell conceives of a brilliant bank job that he believes will succeed. Early in the film he takes hostages, and Frazier is called on to free them and to nab Russell and his accomplices. Meanwhile, there are other things going on outside the bank that Russell is not aware of, which is where Jodie Foster's character comes in.A lot of the tricks in the robbery (slowly revealed over the course of the film) are indeed brilliant, if perhaps all are not entirely plausible in real life.The letdown comes from the non-criminals. First, Frazier repeatedly acts in ways that seem quite hard to believe from a trained hostage negotiator. His first verbal exchange with Russell is not at all the measured way of establishing rapport that you would expect. At times Frazier shows flashes of brilliance, but equally often he ends up looking like he is out of his depth, needlessly gambling with the lives of dozens of people for no real gain.Jodie Foster makes a brave effort, but her character is just not very believable. Due to the fairly cheesy lines and situations she is involved with, she ends up looking more like a plot device than an actual person.In the end, the film is certainly no turkey, but there are better caper films out there with better scripts.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

the finest bank robber's tale burned to celluloid yet,"Inside Manreviewed by Sam Osbornrating: 4 out of 4Inside Man is an intelligent film about intelligent people. It maneuvers about its battlefront, moving its pieces back and forth and around and about. There are good guys and there are bad guys. But who we want to win is rarely transparent. Here, the battlefront is the Manhattan Trust Bank. The Cops are Willem Dafoe, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Denzel Washington, the latter two playing Detectives Frazer and Mitchell. The robber is Clive Owen playing Dalton Russell, who introduces the film staring straight into camera, laying out the who, the what, the where and the when. The How, he says, is where there's the rub.His plan is ingenious and, more importantly, without pretension. But as in all heist films, the real genius behind the crime is the screenwriter. Richard Gewirtz is Inside Man's literary composer. His approach to the material is one of simplicity. The credits don't roll with our fingers scratching bald spots on our brains. Gewirtz keeps it simple. We are never duped by Inside Man. Mr. Russell tells us in the beginning what his clues are, filling us in on the rest of it at the end. That's right, I heard that sigh of relief. You don't need a PhD. in Criminology to understand this film. There also aren't cheap tricks of style here. No characters are Crazy Johnny, or Scary Sammy, and Fat Jimmy. They are Detective Frazer, Madeleine White, and Dalton Russell. And don't expect the dumb renegade robber undermining the mastermind's authority either. Gewirtz sidestepped that part too. Gewirtz in fact dodged all the usual bullets surrounding heist pictures. His film is smart and crisp, much like the suits our characters wear. They're attacks rarely involve bullets, but are instead borne out of wits and brains. And for this Inside Man feels full.Spike Lee is unafraid of Inside Man's 130 minutes. It's a long running time for bank robber flick, I know; but this is an epic, plain and simple. And Inside Man is lean. Not a frame is wasted here. It's taken at a vicious clip, never slacking and refusing to allow those bubbles of boredom to trickle up. Lee knows the script is magnificent, and lets it do its thing. He instead focuses his efforts on the film's look. Each shot drips with self-importance, which is fine. Lee wants us to believe these characters to be Power Players. They're all working for results, making us wonder on which side of justice each character rests. His aggressive approach to the film mirrors this, launching us past the money in the bank, and onto the battleground's topographical map, watching as the Players propel themselves about on little floating clouds of motive. Rest assured, however, Spike lee doesn't throw to the breeze his penchant for poetic justice. Justice with Inside Man takes a purer approach than laws can offer.But don't take this as a rave for a film of sophisticates. This isn't a bank robbery film without entertainment. If nothing else, Inside Man is the best damn fun I've had at the movies yet this year. It keeps us hooked, with actors behind the characters who are steely-eyed with experience; the kind of cast most film school students have wet dreams over. Spike Lee's film is ingenious and, more importantly, without pretension. Its style lends itself sometimes to indulgence, sure. But its indulgence is the spice that comes with a Spike Lee Joint, and must be inhaled fully. He's brought the heist genre back to its roots. There are no mice in this game. Only cats maneuvering about, waiting for their chance to pounce. And while we're at it, let's change cats to panthers. Because there are no kittens prancing around Inside Man. What Spike Lee has done is the impossible, much like his Mr. Russell is attempting. Mr. Lee has spun, quite possibly, the finest bank robber's tale burned to celluloid yet.Director: Spike LeeCast: Clive Owen, Denzel Washington, Jodie FosterScreenplay: Richard GewirtzMPAA Classification: R (language and some violent images)",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Getting Inside the Inside Man,"My name is TMY. Pay strict attention to what I say because I choose my words carefully and I never repeat myself. Recently I watched Inside Man to see Dayton Russell (Clive Owen) plan and set in motion events that execute the perfect bank robbery. Why? Because he can.Okay, the above line is paraphrased on the opening lines of the movie.There's nothing like a good Spike Lee movie. When all else fails, in terms of box office receipts (for those of you blur cases, USA box office has been undergoing an almost 2 year slump thanks to big budget movies being kicked around by low budget indi films. Might write about that one day), I can always count on Spike to deliver.Also the man who brought us Malcolm X and 25th Hour (which is a VERY good movie, watch it!), Spike Lee delivers a knockout film with Inside Man. That being said, a word of caution is necessary. Inside Man is nothing like his other films. It is not as controversial, not as ambiguous, and not as thought provoking. It's quite mainstream, but mainstream in a highly entertaining way, with excellent performances all around.Dayton Russell (Clive Owen) robs a bank with a few of his kahoots and holds everyone in it hostage. The negotiator, Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) and the rest of the world of policemen, try to negotiate a deal with Russell. In the meantime, subplots unfold when the mytestious but powerful Madeline White (Jodie Foster) interferes and pulls some strings both with the cops and with the crooks. So what's really going on between these three entities? That's all the show is about. Needless to say, all three leading actors are top notch. There are only a few scenes where two of these characters interact, but when they do, the scene will stick your head more than the gun totting sequences. (There's only one actual scene where Russell and Frazier meet, and that is easily the best moment in the film) One aspect of the film that really intrigued me (and irritated me as well) is that Spike Lee chose to carry the film through in an atmosphere of 1960's film noir set in the modern day. The music, which instantly reminded me of L.A. Confidential, blows their glorious hero-istic trumpets every single time the cops make a move. It's not even suspense!!! Then the whole thing about dark corners, shadows, mystery, intrigue, and the dangerous female all come into play. We've had some heavily film noir inspired films of late, ala Sin City, but Inside Man is more traditional, in a modern way. Ha.The entire concept of the film is brilliant. When you think you've seen all the heist movies to not be surprised anymore, you'll be surprised at how clever Inside Man really is. Yeah, sometimes the scenes get choppy when it mashes up with different story lines, and yeah the more delicate sub plots are sometimes a tad tedious. But the heist is everything. And Spike Lee being Spike Lee, there are of course moments where he fins opportunities to insert minor movielistic preachings of social issues, such as the disrespect the Americans have for Asians, the danger of video games and how it influences people (For video gamers, there's a 2 minute sequence where you get a PC game flashed on the cinema! How cool is that!) So do watch it. It's not perfect, but hey it's making more money than V for Vendetta at the box office, so it must mean something (since by the traditional nature of films, Inside Man isn't the sort of box office kick-butt films).If anything, watch it for the bit where Dayton Russell talks about romance. Some life principles there worth remembering.7.5/10",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Dirty secrets of the past should not be kept in bank safety deposit boxes...,"At the outset what appears to be a normal bank robbery is far from the truth. Soon enough the viewer realises that nothing is what it seems. A star studded cast spins a riveting web of intrigue, financial manipulation, greed and political manoeuvring. Spike Lee in directing the film has correctly placed Clive Owen in the centre of this web with his portrayal of the calculating methodical bank robber who is out to take advantage of a wealthy bank owner's secret past. Christopher Plummer perfectly portrays the wealthy bank owner in his pathetic plight to hide his greedy, shameful past and the inevitable revelation of his true greedy nature. As the film progresses Spike Lee brilliantly keeps the viewer immersed in his seat as the web is spun tighter and tighter stifling the bank owner's futile attempts from escaping from his past. Amongst the intrigue Jody Forster adds to the deceit and manipulation beautifully with her high society spin doctor role as she tries to take advantage of the situation whatever it maybe. Denzel Washington, the Detective who has to solve the case, beautifully portrays the cynical cop who with hidden vision unravels the truth for the viewers as he uncovers the truth with his ability to read between the lines.

Other then that though this movie is an exciting heist movie.This movie is about a group of bankrobbers who plan on robbing a bank but instead once foiled by police turn it into a hostage negotiation. A negotiator is sent to find out the bank robbers main motive because from what he tell the negotiator he is not telling the truth.This movie is pretty good I just really could not stand the racism of the script and screenplay. Overall though this movie is very enjoyable but could have been much better with a better director.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
An Outstanding Episode of Excitement,"Spike Lee has directed an outstanding film that is filled with excitement. It is a story of a bank heist that supersedes all prior films of the same genre. Denzel Washington plays detective Keith Frazier who is assigned the job of cracking this case. His rival is Clive Owen who plays Dalton Russell, the gang leader who has taken over a major bank in New York City. Christopher Plummer plays Arthur Case, the CEO of the bank whose character is complex and challenging to the viewer. Jodie Foster plays Madeline White, a politically correct liaison to Plummer's character, and she is very convincing in this role. Wilem Davoe is Captain John Darius, and his performance is slick even though is is a minor one. This film will leave you breathless, and don't bother to guess the plot. It is a gem of a film and one of Denzel's very best.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
C'mon! You've seen Dog Day Afternoon! You're stalling!,"This is a great caper film. You are kept guessing throughout the entirety of this movie. You find the actions of the bank robbers to be very cleaver - dressing everyone alike so the police will not be able to distinguish thief from hostage - but, there are enough misdirections that you never really know what is going on. Did it fail or not? Will they get away? Is it the perfect crime? You just have to tune in to find out. Brilliant.Spike Lee gave us a great film that is a departure from his usual fare. Denzel Washington and Clive Owen were absolutely on target with their performances. It is all low key and methodical. Youare kept interested every step of the way.The only criticism I have of the film is the waste of a fine actress like Jodie Foster. She could have been written out of the film and not be missed.

Wish I would've waited for this movie to come on DVD because at least I wouldn't be out $9. The movie totally misses the mark. What could have been a GREAT movie for all actors, turned out to be a B-movie at best. Movie moved VERY slow and just when I thought it was going somewhere, it almost did but then it didn't. In this day and age, we need unpredictable plot twists and closures in film, and this film offered neither. The whole thing about how everyone is a suspect is good, however, not sure if it was the way it was directed, the lighting, the delivery of lines, the writing or what, but nothing came from it. Lot of hype for nothing. I was VERY disappointed in this film, and I'm telling everyone NOT to see it. The cheesy saxophone music throughout made the film worse as well.

Intelligent heist film,"Spike Lee's Inside Man starring Denzel Washington has been heavily praised since its release in 2006, both as a bank heist film and an overall crime drama.This film is quite unique and different than the typical heist film in a sense where the drama had a slow build but a worthy of suspense and thrills. The acting is top notch from both Washington and Clive Owen. Jodie Foster was seemingly thrown in and was about the worst part of this great film.Otherwise, Inside Man delivers what was expected as an entertaining crime mystery heist film. Even with a run time of over two hours, the film moves at a solid pace where time seems to go quickly (meaning it's a good thing). Highly recommend for fans of Spike Lee, or Denzel or fans of well made heist films.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Superb thriller that is a heist movie or is it ?,"Great stuff, good acting, tight script, superb interaction between the two main characters, Fosters performance is so so not enough menace or polished baddie for me. That said one of the best flicks so far in 2006. The ""minor "" roles all pulled out the stops, not to be missed, and don't walk out until you see the credits run , a twist in the last minute keeps you involved. Possibly Owens best screen turnout to date and the two cops have some great lines in humour and put down.

A fabulous romp!,"This movie jumps out of the starting gate at full pace and keeps going all the way to the end. There are a few potholes, but in this case we don't care! It's a rare movie that can make us ignore these elements.The suspense is peppered with just the right amount of understated humour. It even includes a morality play, plus a bit of the obligatory action (to keep the gun-blazing-addicts happy) ... but not too much, thank goodness. The director has the right balance of everything throughout, including the use of some interesting unconventional visual and audio techniques.I normally don't like Denzel as an actor -- he is way too smarmy -- but this movie doesn't need him to be overly serious, and it suits him well.

High concept bank robbery melodrama from filmmaker Spike Lee seems like a departure but really is a half-baked homage to one of his favorite '70s films, ""Dog Day Afternoon"", with an under-investigation NYC police detective (Washington having a ball) assigned to a Wall St. area bank robbery led by no-nonsense Owen who may or may not have something up his sleeve in perfecting the perfect crime.

"Good start, but meanders towards the end","A fantastic cast has been assembled for the heist movie, and the plot is very good. It is somewhat let down by the fact that the tension never builds properly, so there i no real pay off or climax. Maybe thats good, but with sort of movie, it is about who knows what and who's ahead of the game, so it really should be shorter and more tightly focused. For instance, Jodie Fosters character is kind of in no mans land (good performance from her though). She is supposed to be playing some important role (we think) but never does anything. Use it or lose it! The movie has all the elements of a great heist movie, but the uneven pacing lets it down compared to a film like Oceans 11.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
It'll be great on Cable TV,"This is not the best work of Spike, Denzel, Jodie or Clive, but still this film is worth a look. I decided to see it because I am passionately in love with New York and thought a native film maker would give the city the loving care it needs.While I cannot say I was disappointed in the overall film, I can say that this film barely used more than a handful of NYC's locations. In it we saw a few Manhattan sites: inside the Wall Street area bank, the streets outside the downtown bank, the spectacular offices of the bank's chairman, inside the apartment that the Denzel character shares with his incredibly attractive on-screen girlfriend and a fancy restaurant in midtown. That's it.A basic bank heist film, Inside Man lacks the complexities of a ""Dog Day Afternoon,"" but does deliver on some of the basic insecurities of a post 9/11 city in transition, including the otherness of anyone who appears to be Arab (and this case a Sikh gentlemen), the lack of resources afforded the NYPD (who are left to search through a crowd to determine the language someone is speaking) and the fears of those who are comforted by a street sign (in this case the backdrop of an outdoor board that cries out 'we will never forget').Still on an up note I will say that in INSIDE MAN,a. Denzel Washington proves he has the comedic chops to stand up to anyone as he delivers line after hilarious line that leaves the audience chuckling out loud and thatb. Spike Lee and Jodie Foster have the guts to portray a woman of a certain age as she is - Botox free and full of normal, pretty wrinkle, unlike her contemporaries the Desperate Housewives.If you are looking for SHE'S GOTTA HAVE IT, look elsewhere. INSIDE MAN is not as good. If you are looking for SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, look elsewhere; this is not as good. If you are looking for MALCOLM X, look else where; this is not as good.But if you are looking for a fun little date movie or a great cable find, tune it. INSIDE MAN leaves you with a lot to think about in almost the same way that Oscar Wilde's A PERFECT HUSBAND does.

Hits and misses,"There really isn't any incentive for watching these movies, because of the poor directing that is set as a standard for modern movies, and because of the lack of inspiration caused by establishment writers stealing ideas from the better writers, as this movie so obviously shows us.It isn't a bad movie, but it has the flaws of modern movie making.It's a ""bank heist with hostage"" movie, but it's clear from the start that something else is happening. When the robbers separate the many hostages, and make everyone change garb over and over, including the garb of the robbers, we know they are intending to blend in with the crowd at the end in some way.In effect, it's much like the 1960 war movie, THEN THERE WERE THREE, in which a German is disguised as an American during a big battle involving many units that get split apart. The war movie is a hidden classic because of low budget and few big names, but it is written and directed skillfully.The first problem is the inane modern day use of ""mixing time frames"" which not only doesn't fit here, but is stupid, because it is contrived. It's a device meant to confuse whereas it doesn't work in real life. It only serves to hide the flaws of the plot. If you see the movie, you'll understand.Second problem is that every one of the hostages and robbers looks exactly alike. I believe there are about 4 that don't fit the pattern. All the men look alike, and most of the women look alike. And yet we're supposed to understand who is saying what at any time? Added to the ""time frame mix"".Third, no detective is as astute as Denzel's character. Of course, this is spoken of in the movie. Detectives are unimaginative and have no sense of reality compared to the cop on the beat. They're upwardly mobile machines who are incorrect about everyone most of the time, because they adhere to these dark ages of Psychiatry and Sociology meant to give the squeaky wheel the grease and avoid being hurt themselves.Fourth, the flood of information. That means all the useless crap we get that is purely in the movie to showcase or advertise someone's dialect, product, etc.. Because of the nature of this movie, that works as long as it doesn't interfere with the reality of the viewer piecing together the puzzle. It sets the viewer back from what the actual detective is piecing together.This fourth flaw is important, because it a simulation of modern culture, including Academia. Colleges and businesses pretend to give tests to grade students, but for the past 30 years, at the very least, have instead cheated. For example, a professor will ask a question in an oral test to a student, and then after the student answers, the professor will change the question, and will be backed up by the students who are part of the establishment. This happens in all U.S. universities I have attended. Businesses do this, too. It's the modern norm to keep control in the hands of the mob.Herein lies also the strength of the movie. The fact that no one really knows anything, and everyone is lying. However, the script is not very good at showing that.The fifth flaw is characters that no one can relate to. Again, this is because of modern culture, and because the control freaks are in control. They actually think we enjoy them bragging about their hatefulness, but only the geeks enjoy that. There is absolutely no explanation or credibility in some of the characters, particularly the blond woman who acts as a go between for police, bank president, and robber. She would never have been let into the situation by any of them. But then, this also serves as a strength of the movie, because Tarantino is telling us that the control freaks in charge are too moronic and self righteous to realize this woman is nothing. She has no assets. She's normal looking, not pretty by any means. She says nothing, offers nothing, and yet the ones in authority kowtow to her. That actually works. However, when Denzel's character gives in to her, we lose respect for him, too.The characters are mostly poorly written and done. The usual Hollywood preaching of ""bank robbers are cool"" fools the na√Øve, but not the rest of us, and it irks sane people.There are other modern movie flaws, but the production team was wise enough not to show that this ""modern movie making"" was indeed a flaw. It's a self depreciating bit that does make a point.Hits and misses. The worst part is the ""mixed time frame"" element. Get rid of that, and the movie will be a lot better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

This is exacerbated when a fixer is called in to help diffuse the situation.One of Spike Lee's most well executed films, Inside Man is a great addition to the heist genre that ranks right up there with Dog Day Afternoon.

This is a Bank job worth going on,The problem with these movies is does the ending match up to what has gone before? The answer is yes and no. The movie sets the siege situation up nicely with fine acting from Denzil Washington and Clive Owen as the cop/robber protagonists. There's also fine support acting from Christopher Plummer as the bank's owner with a decidedly dodgy past and a superb turn by Jodie Foster who nearly steals the movie as a hard as nails bitch who is determined to get what she wants out of the situation. The movie rattles along at a pace and certainly keeps up your interest into how the robbers will get out of the bank when it is surrounded by New York's finest. When the ending comes there are some buts and hows mixed with disbelief but that doesn't detract from the movie as a whole which is well worth catching.,7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Clever crime caper,"This is a clever crime caper comedy/drama from Spike Lee with authentic NY atmosphere (you can almost smell the bagels and coffee), astringent dialogue, and a hole in the plot you could drive an armoured car through. There is fine acting from a mostly obscured Clive Owen as the chief robber and a brown suit-wearing Denzil Washington as the lead cop, with significant contributions from Jodie Foster (in a rather improbable part of a super fixer), Christopher Plummer (suavely villainous as usual) and Willem Dafoe (cast against type as the most sensible person in the NYPD).A bank siege is one of the great movie/TV clich√©s but this one is off-beat enough to hold the viewer's interest, despite going on too long (125 minutes) and having too many diversions ¬ñ though we are spared too many sub-plots. Some nice camera work is helped by ""cosy"" production design ¬ñ it's an appropriately crowded film. The intercutting of the story with post-robbery interrogations, done without giving the game away was a clever touch also.The hole in the plot? Well, again without giving the game away it seems the robbers are not so interested in the bank's money as in the contents of a certain safe deposit box. We not told how they found out about it, but the contents, we are told, will severely embarrass the respected elderly citizen whose box it is (and who happens to be the chairman of the bank). But ask yourself, why on earth would the person concerned have kept this particular incriminating document? It has no value to him. He has no incentive to keep it. Yet he keeps it in the box for 60 years. Has he got a death wish? Have I missed something?",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

One word review: DENZEL,"I revisited this movie one decade later for two reasons:
1) Spike Lee
2) Netflix
It is indeed an incredibly well done heist film. The characters are almost all believable. The performances are solid. The plot twists are a little too neat, but enough to keep you guessing. And the pacing is just about perfect. But far and away the biggest stand out is Denzel. I had completely forgotten how he could transform an average detective role in a standard heist movie into an epic performance. He dominated every single scene and moment, and he reminded me that great actors are not defined by what they do with truly great roles. Great actors are defined by when they make average roles transcendent. I see you, Mr Washington. Bravo.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Excellent plot movie,"First of all this is not an action movie. It is a plot movie that makes one watch it till the end to see how it goes down.
Secondly, it requires some knowledge about history and present day ramifications to understand the plot and to see beyond what is actually told or suggested.
Third, the line between the good and bad is very faint and do not expect to see good guys and bad guys clearly marked. Things are shown like in real life. Nothing is where one might expect it to be...or maybe is exactly there. It depends.
Finally, the cast is very good, the actors play very well and the director is a master. All this added makes for an excellent movie to see on a Saturday night.
I enjoyed it and recommend it.

Who's The Inside Man?,"Revealing any part of the story of Spike Lee's 'Inside Man' is tricky without risking spoilers. It starts off as a first class action thriller and progresses into a cleverly knit heist film full of twists and turns that are layered with depth. While the original plot of Russell Gewirtz's screenplay remains complex and tightly woven, the rich and witty tongue-in cheek dialogues are loaded with subtle humour and sarcasm. Though the background history of the heist itself isn't explored, some interesting hint is provided as the film focuses on the present.For Spike Lee 'Inside Man' is something different from what he's done earlier and he proves again what a versatile director he is. This is a 'light' film compared to those he's been known for making. He's assembled a top notch cast like Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster, Chiwetel Ejiorfor, Willen Dafoe, Christopher Plummer, each of which does a stand-out job.On the flip side, with the exception of Keith Frazier and Arthur Case, most of the characters are poorly developed. Yet, one is so involved in the intricacies of the plot that it's easy to overlook this flaw. Due to tight editing the story moves at a fast pace.'Inside Man' is a well-made film. Lee successfully builds up tension in the atmosphere but he does it against formula as this is far from the usual heist flick. It's definitely one of those movies where you notice new things with each revisitation and so I'll be sure to watch it again.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

This is an intelligent thriller and moves along very well just based on an excellent script. The heist is amazingly well planned.This is not a typical Spike Lee joint but he proves he's a good director with the pacing. See the pandemonium when the news of the heist first breaks (near the beginning of the movie). The camera goes crazy but when we get to the bank, its totally calm. Different mood tones are created. It was also nice to see an old legend like Christopher Plummer in a decent role. My only complaint would be that the Jodie Foster character was not fully developed.

What a sting!,"Rooms full of hysterical hostages, red tape and police wrapped around the block, snipers perched on every windowsill, and an escape route that involves a 747.

And with all the hostages stripped and redressed in exactly the same clothes as the robbers (minus gun-type accessories), soon it is impossible to tell who the bad guys are. Crack police negotiator, Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) heads towards the bank declaring ""Bad guys here I come"", only he has to wade through quite a few bad guys on the outside first.The film is called Inside Man, so it is easy to suspect everyone. But those bad robbers are so smart, sensitive and appalled by the violence of video games and the good guys are so honest, hard working and dashing. We are seduced into liking them both and cannot take sides. Fortunately, there is Madeline White (Jodie Foster), who makes a very good living as ""an expeditor"", ie pay her enough money and she can fix anything. She is a right nasty piece of work - totally amoral and smug about it. Phew, we cannot like her!The uncomfortably slow siege of the bank does stretch our patience and belief that this will end perfectly.

I really enjoyed this movie.,"The film opens with Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) informing us of his intention to rob a bank for two reasons: for money and because he can. He states that since we now know the who and the what, all that's left is the how, which is what Lee's film is all about. But for someone who addresses the audience directly into the camera, he isn't being entirely honest. For as we eventually learn, Dalton and his three accomplices are after the chairman of the bank's safety deposit box and the contents that lie within. Chairman Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer) hides a dark secret in there, and he hires a mysterious woman, Madeline White (Jodie Foster), to make sure, whether she must make a deal with the criminals or the police, that what's in his box never surfaces in public.But now that you know the basic plot, there are two minor characters in this film who are the key to understanding it. The first is a young boy, who's a hostage along with his father. It's during his conversation in the central vault with Dalton that we get the film's most telling moment. Lee begins the scene with a slow zoom into the vault, intentionally highlighting the importance of this scene. All the other hostages had to strip down, give up their keys and cell phones, and put the same painters' suits on as the robbers, but this boy was allowed to keep his PSP player and his clothes along with receiving much gentler treatment. So in the vault, he and Dalton are each sitting on a pile of money, and they begin to talk about the video game he's playing, which apparently is some version of Grand Theft Auto.I really enjoyed this movie. The actors were good. The story was good and there were plenty of funny lines that I guffawed at. Denzel Washington was great as the NY cop who had to negotiate with Clive Owen, also great, who was holding hostages in a bank. Spike Lee's direction was superb. There were no throw away scenes. Take for example the cell phone scene where the criminals told everyone to dump their phones into a sack. That could have been handled very differently but it was prolonged and stretched out to provide a suspenseful scene. The incident didn't really have much to do with the main plot but it was handled so well you were on the edge of your seat waiting to see what would happen.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Spike Lee goes to Hollywood, but takes his touch and his ideas with him.","It appears that Spike Lee can do conventional; he can do genre and he can do generic. But to call Inside Man conventional, generic and by the book I feel would be a little harsh because it's actually a thoroughly entertaining and somewhat engrossing film about a heist (heist being the genre) and the actions and reactions that will shape the outcome of the heist.This is Spike Lee for the most restless of crowds: big name actors like Denzel Washington; Clive Owen; Jodie Foster and Willem Dafoe; sequences drawn out in suspense and intrigue as hostages threaten to out smart their captors and enough fast cuts and scenes of fast talking dialogue that furthers the plot and makes the film the fun ride it is. From what it sounds, Inside Man seems like a film that could've been directed by anybody ¬ñ indeed, Ron Howard was going to direct this initially but Lee stepped in when Howard took up another project; I think both directors are very different to one another in terms of their approaches to film so for a film to be scraped by Howard, taken up by Lee and STILL to turn out to be pretty darn good just goes to show you.But underneath Inside Man's supposedly generic surface lies certain 'Lee' touches I've come to notice in each of his films. I wonder how different the script was after Lee stepped in; my guess is it changed, centrefold. The character's in Howard's film might all have been white but Lee has African-Americans; Jews; Chinese people and even a Sikh in his film, indeed all four of these ethnic backgrounds are hostages at one point, are let out at another point and then interrogated. The film has its Sikh character independent and strongly willed. He is agitated that the police forced him to remove his headwear and does not cooperate thus giving the police a hard time. I wonder how the scene would've panned out had another director that doesn't take time to acknowledge and respect ethnicity in films ¬ñ perhaps the same, perhaps differently in a disrespectful way, perhaps there wouldn't even have been a Sikh there in the first place: we'll never know.But this is one of quite a few clever things Inside Man has going for it. This is Spike Lee doing action, this is Spike Lee going all 'Hollywood' on us but in a good fashion because he brings his touch to the picture and he brings his ideas and content to a genre film. There are numerous references to previous American films that have stood the test of time in the majority's eyes: The Godfather and Dog Day Afternoon; there is even a brief reference to the third Die Hard film that anybody who has seen it more than once will immediately pick up on; I read after seeing Inside Man Spike Lee had no intention of the reference, but there you go. However, it is a single quote that backs up my theory that the screenplay and script may have been changed once Lee came onboard and that is when one man states ""Anybody who has seen decent (Hollywood) action film knows what an AK-47 looks like"". I feel this is Lee almost announcing 'Yeah, OK; I'm going against directorial type here but you know what? I'm going to show you anyway by making this film in the action genre'.This repetition and use of reference to older, more recognised American films made by white Americans at the time could well be a personal commentary by Lee on how so few black directors make truly recognisable films. Indeed, when the character that states the Ak47 quote comes so close to being self-aware in the film, it is Spike Lee recognising formula and typical props used in these formulas. Spike Lee tells us he recognises the typical gun in the typical action film but deliberately keeps it in because he knows that's what people want in the genre ¬ñ familiarity and formula, two words you would never usually associate with Lee. This also tells us that just because he makes Inside Man, he will not buckle under the temptation to go 'formulaic' on us in the future after his career of 'un-formulaic' films.Spike Lee also finds space to toy with formula. To begin the film with a monologue told by the antagonist of the tale is a twisted method of story telling in itself. Suddenly, the story is being told orally from the bad guy's point of view and in the past tense ¬ñ that can't be usual. Lee also echoes some of his earlier work, namely Clockers which dealt with 'black on black' crime. The black son of a seemingly upstanding black man plays a video game that even the antagonist played by Clive Owen labels 'sick' since it is all about black characters killing other black characters. What's even eerier is that it is a young black boy who's playing it. This may well be an even more in depth response to computer game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas; released two years previously to Inside Man and a game loosely about African-Americans killing one another.But as a film, Inside Man works a treat. There are too many scenes in which the police and the bank robbers talk to one another face to face for my liking and that cannot be attributed to the breaking away of conventions because it doesn't need to even happen. However, with twits and turns as well as an enjoyable approach, the film holds up as a piece of entertainment; holding your attention close to throughout.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
boring,"I like Spike Lee movies. This one just does not do it. How many movies have i seen in the last 20 years about busting the ""secret NAZI"" as if i have ever met one. I found this plot so ridiculous its beyond belief. Bank robbers who are not bank robbers yet are, and fake a killing of a hostage. That was dumb. Then there is Plummer playing the part of the hiding Nazi collaborator. That story has been done enough. I get the point OK. Nazis are bad guys. Tell me something i don't know.

A Modern Urban Western your eyes and heart love to watch,"Spike Lee is one of the greatest American directors - of the indie movement of the East-coast. He opens up a bank heist movie with an Indian soundtrack - unlikely but a fitting juxtaposition that only him (or Q Tarantino) may be able to pull off. Spike Lee has balls to make bold movies - it's Spike Lee for crying out-loud. In this modern urban 'Western' - a genuinely American cinematic genre that originated in cinema first and then sprawled to literature and other arts - or as he calls it 'A Spike Lee joint', the thieves (bad guys) win and the detective (good guy) is kinda respecting that too, at the end of the day. Corruption is constant and epidemic, with its own rules of the game. That's the real stuff of life, whether we like it or not.

One of the coolest movies of all times,"This movie comes to perfection in every single way. This movie is one of those movies which has a script that makes you think, it's a movie that literally is dripping with style.

"An intelligent and charismatic ""heist"" movie","Spike Lee directs this film superbly. The pace, cinematography and acting are all of a very high standard. I particularly enjoyed how the film unfolded and that we're never really sure whose side to be on.Denzel Washington's cop under a cloud is the obvious choice at first but its hard to resist the compelling anti-hero in Clive Owen, who at last has a role he can sink his teeth into (he sucked in ""King Arthur"" but then so did the film).Once underway, we're introduced to Jodie Foster's well-connected ""bitch-manipulator"" and Christopher Plummer's ""fat-cat"" characters who add extra spice into the mix. The script is generally excellent and the story resolves well, treating our heroes and anti-heroes appropriately.Overall, a thoroughly engaging and enjoyable film!",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Complex but rewarding story,"It was difficult to figure out the guts of the movie. In a sense, all were against Denzel and the mass won even if he knew there was something amiss. I think at the very end, he must have had some respect for the staged operation since a it would require painstaking practice and planning to pull such a crime off. In the movie, nearly everybody involved, right from the CEO and Jodie Foster (as a liaison) of the bank to some of the hostages. It was a clever plan to confuse all the hostages and to stage executions on video tape. The movie was great. It would be hard to imagine how much that money is needed to influence people in situations of chaos and desperation as the federal police cars, the city mayor, but the story does not detail the planning involved.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"good thriller, but was this a Spike Lee film?","'Inside Man' is a good thriller movie. It has a different idea, and what starts like your usual bank robbery film turns into a more sophisticated action film that you would have expected. You keep asking yourself together with most of the characters what the thieves are after, and they plan to get out of the hostages situation in the mid of Manhattan, and when it happens it all makes sense.It is also well acted. Denzel Washington and Clive Owen are the main players in the cat and mouse game, while Jodie Foster, Willem Dafoe and Cristopher Plummer give strong and key supporting roles.Yet, I may ask, is this a Spike Lee movie? We are always used to Lee making something different or surprising, saying something that makes sense from a social or political point of view. Here he almost plays truthfully the role of conventional thriller director, the fact that the good detective is an Afro-American does not take it for a social comment for a long time, and from this perspective I was a little disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Horrible copycat,"Now isn't it? Considering all the good work done by danzel,Clive and Jodie, the movie never grew into something more than a horrible die-hard/heist movies copycat.

IF someone can tell me why on earth were they digging a hole inside that safe, who the hell is the Rebe and how on earth did they know that the diamonds were in the particular cell, it could just make my day, but it seems that Spike asks us to take too much things in this one for granted, and do not raise our eyebrows when something looks stupid...its just another studio contract movie relax and enjoy...",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Love This Movie,"Being a big fan of Denzel and having watched most all of his movies I believe that this is among his finest. But, as we know it takes more than just good actors to make a movie.

One of my favorites.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Jackpot!,"This movie is the movie I've been longing for for a while. I don't go to watch movie in theaters as often as before. Now, I prefer to wait and watch it all on DVD. What made me watch this movie at a cinema?? My favorite actor, Denzel Washington.I watched this trailers many times before it hits the cinema. I know that this is gonna be a hit for me when I see the cast and suspected that the movie will have a good plot. A kind of movie that would entice me. The only thing that got me thinking was the Director, Spike Lee. This is not a movie that I'd expect from Spike Lee but I got to say that he did well in his new category.Being from Indonesia, having friends who idolizes Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise etc. I never really have one actor that really hits me as a real good actor until I stepped on Vancouver. I started watching my first Denzel Washington movie and I thought he's a pretty interesting actor. I started watching his other movies and I knew straight away he's the finest actor Hollywood has. Also, I noticed that Denzel don't just choose any acting roles. All his movies are either very meaningful and his action movies has good plots.Remember the Titans, John Q, Man On Fire, The Siege, Out of Time are some of his many good movies. The only movie I don't like was the remake of The Manchurian Candidate although Denzel puts a strong performance in front of the camera too. Good supporting role he played in Atwone Fisher.Anyway, back to the movie: it will make you laugh, wonder and think. The suspense is fun as the humor in the movies. The thing I want to warn you all is the strong language they use in this movie that gives it an R rating. Also, the movie made fun of some other old movie which I'm not gonna spoil and some of you might not notice it anyway. Sikhs might find a scene to be offensive but I know my Sikh friends actually enjoyed the scene. Anyway, the plot, the laughters, the strong performance of the cast will let you leave with fulfillment + enjoyment of watching the movie. I know everyone in theater does!I give it a 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Slick and sassy but unsatisfying,"Despite a lot of clever dialogue and some excellent performances this latest Spike Lee effort is unsatisfying. The complicated plot ultimately doesn't hold together. But the movie has a great New York feel and when it is funny it is very funny--as when a local citizen is asked to aid the police and shows up at the scene of the emergency with a paper bag full of old parking tickets she wants fixed.Lee and his scriptwriter think that corruption is everywhere and that the rich and powerful can always get anything they want, so they don't find it necessary for their story to make sense; it is enough to say: ""See, this is a corrupt plot by a rich man. See how evil they are?"" Denzel Washington is fun to watch, as is Kim Director, in a minor role.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Holds up well on multiple viewings,"This is a fantastic heist movie. Denzel Washington is brilliant as the out of favour detective negotiating with mysterious bank robber Clive Owen. Both leads are great but in particular Washington's naturalistic acting style is so appealing and works brilliantly in this highly cynical, murky world. The cleverness and the intrigue held up just as well in a 2nd viewing as it did on the first and the story telling format cross cutting between police interviews and bank robbery is really fun.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Great concept, strong cast and yet...{{Spoilers Possible}}","...something feels a little wanting here.Spike Lee,continuing to gradually drift away from the straight,socio-political meat movies that made him famous(Do the Right Thing,Jungle Fever,Malcolm X,Get On the Bus) and towards more general genres(Crooklyn,Clockers,Girl 6,Summer of Sam)helms this film which is intended to be a crime caper. I say intended because the story takes fragmented turns throughout,no doubt to be the(or part of the)""twist""this movie aims for.On a seemingly typical New York City morning at a large branch bank,a highly elaborate robbery takes place and in the process,a large number of hostages are taken. The leader of this effort,Dalton Ross(Clive Owen,interesting choice and doesn't disappoint)has planned this effort to the letter,creating a situation that has the NYPD scrambling. One detective,Frazier(Denzel Washington,cool and smart,game for any head-game out there) is reading the situation and seems to be able to make a psychological connection with Ross. At the same time,the upright bank founder and owner(Christopher Plummer),sensing that there may be some sort of sticky mess on the loom thanks to this burglary,employs an outside agent--a ""fixer"",as she's referred to--named White(Jodie Foster)to try to work in concert with the police get what he wants.As said before,this is a neat concept of a film:basically,a crime caper that sort of ""knows"" what it is and yet moves at a somewhat different pacing and aim. I'm coming perilously close to revealing stuff about this film,so I'll only say that you the viewer if you choose to watch this will be well-advised to AVOID jumping to any conclusions during the run of the movie. I say that,because I kinda fell into that trap a few times while watching this. Writer Russell Gewirtz's script seems to be striving to be a little TOO clever,and the cut-aways and non-sequitirial jumps in the linnear progress of the story can be somewhat(if not a lot)discombobulating and irritating. Washington and Owen are strong here,Foster doesn't seem to quite belong in this movie and plummer seems to be playing something he's been playing a little too often,namely upright elder-statesmen who have potential for keeping ugly skeletons in their closets. Director Lee's social commentary is limited but smart,with the very few of his observations leveled mostly on the NYPD police and how they can over-react and assume(a la profiling)to suspects or perceived suspects in a crisis situation.Interesting,somewhat difficult to warm up to,I'd still say that this film shouldn't let down fans of most of the principals of this film(particularly Denzel's). My only real tip for viewing this movie is this:watch it to the end and keep an open mind.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

I found myself looking for more but finding nothing then left for the toilet expecting them to give me an unexpected swing, but you come back and see things unfolding as predicted. The big part of the story can be predicted from the start. Sometimes things are just too obvious. The end of the hostage taking is so predictable that you could be blind and figure it out just by listening to Gewirtz, and finding out that things will be just like you predicted.Not at all what was expected from their trailer promotional blitz.

Don't waste your time seeing it. This movie was pretty much an insult to William Dafoe, I mean, if you could give a man the worst script in a movie, they sure gave it to him, give him him a Grammy at least.

Inside Man is the most clever and interesting bank robbery film I have ever seen!,"Inside Man is mind-blowing, clever, fast-paced, well-crafted, and downright brilliant. With an all-star cast led by Denzel Washington and Clive Owen, Inside Man takes twists and turns you never see coming. Denzel's clever charm combats Clive's steely calm intensity leaving the audience intrigued and engaged, wondering what is happening from start to finish. The genius writing makes the crazy robbery scheme seem believable and actually possible. Inside Man makes you root for both sides of the law wanting the burglars to succeed and the cops to get their man with a highly satisfying and rewarding resolution. My only complaints would be the final 20 minutes falters in pacing a little as it attempts to tie all the threads together, and all the foul language was unnecessary. All in all, Inside Man is a brilliant must-see for any heist film enthusiast, Denzel Washington fan, or movie lover in general.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"A good effort, but needs to be more cohesive","It's a new Spike Lee joint! So inside man is basically a caper/hostage negotiation drama. It's got all the typical things you'd see in these types of films. Cops. Robbers. Hostages. Intricate plots. But... no daring chases, no real flashy action... and so it's mostly the drama (and bits of comedy).In the end, the film feels sort of real and sort of unreal at the same time. The direction and the writing speak very much to the realness of the ""regular characters."" The regulars being the cops, the hostages, the citizens on the street. But the ""powerful"" characters, as well as the lead robber character are a little surreal. Not to say that they're bad, but the powerful characters are the ones that seem to come more out of the typical caper films and the regular characters out of more ordinary dramas. This clash has a slightly negative effect because it makes it hard to get ""in"" to the film.Although Spike Lee has a directorial flash and style all his own, at the same time, he hasn't yet been able to make it a standard language of his cinema, so when you need a backwards dolly-shot with Denzel Washington on what looks like a people mover you remember that you're watching a movie. It knocks you out of the film. The interview segments that intercut the action are less jarring since the film begins with Clive Owen in an interview.However, the plotting is clever, the humor is believable and enjoyable and the racial undertones to parts of the film are appreciable without being overdone. The weakness is in the total cohesion and the suspension of disbelief. It felt like there were two films being made of different tones and there were combined in this movie and didn't entirely get along. But a good effort. Spike, keep at it.Finally, Inside Man didn't feel very theatrical. Probably because it didn't immerse me that well in its world. So I'd say it's a rental. A flawed, but good effort. And certainly not a bad choice to watch... although by no means necessary. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Lame, lame, lame!","Just saw this movie last night after recommendations from this site. Boy did I make a mistake there! I'm sorry but anyone who enjoyed this film has to be kidding.This film is garbage. Predictable ""twists"", and flawed in so many ways regarding the plot, this movie offered nothing. It was about 2 hours long but after the opening 15 minutes I was bored.There are no ""heroes"" in this film. Denzel Washington, playing the detective on the case conforms to your typical cocky and sexist New York officer. In one scene, we have the detective and his buddy leering at a woman's chest, due to it's ampleness when they are questioning her. That got a few giggles. That was the level of the humour.The Indian guy who gets pulled in for questioning and protests about his turban being confiscated and being called an Arab by one police officer is just silly also. It just doesn't put people of Indian descent in a good light, and just re-enforces this stereotype that these people are different to us normal, rational people, and are a bit strange.We have the ""likable villain"" (Clive Owen's character). How can someone who takes hostages be a likable person, although you're encouraged to think of him this way due to the underlining story. And without giving away the story, how was his decision at the end realistic, and the reaction to his decision by his cohorts for that matter? There's one scene when the detective learns of the horror of a new event and in his shock the director chooses to show a close up of him and make it look as though he is pulled to the scene without his conscious effort, or will. As though he was possessed or something. It was laughable.This film in essence was predictable, boring and implausible.

Ahead of its Time,"Do I need to justify the high score? Have seen this three times and conclude: 1. The best Spike Lee film. Most of Lee's films I have found tend to be self-conscious and this is the exception. In the tradition of the greatest directors of all time, he just stands back and let's the story unfold. Perfect direction.2. Possibly best Denzel film and - oh boy -- that is saying a lot because we have a class-A actor who continually turns out brilliant performances. (This review penned in 2016 and -- for the historical record and IMDb readers of the future -- Denzel just shocked his fans yet again by doing two ""action"" roles which ordinarily would have strained even a younger actor.) What makes this part special is not merely that Denzel is great -- he is always great -- but his character actually evolves and grows during the narrative. Wow.3. Best in a short series of Clive Ownen performances. If you are a student of film you know that Clive was almost ""the next big thing"" (especially after a breakout performance in Bourne 1) and then sort of disappeared, which is a pity. Am a big fan, he has one of the most distinctive voices in film (sounds like a smarter version of Adam Arkin) and brings a gravitas to any role he picks up.4. Script to die for. It is not until you leave the theatre (or turn off the DVD) that you realize this film was ahead of its time. It did not merely offer a clever ""heist"" film but actually de-constructed the heist movie and turned it upside down. (Like Cabin in the woods.) This is a brilliant and entertaining film that you can think about after it is over. And watch every few years, and still enjoy it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Rip Off,"'The basic story is a rip off of a Columbo episode from 1976 featuring Nehemiah Persoff.

Lieutenant Columbo, the cheaply dressed yet extremely intelligent detective from the LAPD's Homicide Division, arrives to investigate Jerome's murder and instantly suspects Santini.

Lee goes mainstream and succeeds,"Spike Lee's most mainstream movie to date starts off as a standard popcorn heist movie, then turns into a character study whilst throwing some nice twists for good measure. It works most of the time, managing to squeeze in a couple of post-9/11 political points, but by and large this is much lighter on the racial Leeisms of films gone by, instead offering us a superior genre movie stop gap so that Lee can now go off and do the serious stuff he yearns to.The cast is one of those ultra-reliable ""do this in their sleep"" line ups featuring the wonder that is Denzil Washington doing his thing as the hostage negotiator sent to try and solve this situation, Clive Owen, whose American accent is still taking it's final exams, is otherwise having the time of his life as the criminal mastermind hoping to score the bank out of all that it's worth and there is fantastic support from Jodie Foster, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Willem Defoe and Christopher Plummer.Half way through inside man the film skips to post-heist scenes of various hostages being interviewed about what they do or don't know. This then sets in motion an intriguing tale of what actually takes place during the heist. It appears as though the robbery may be far more complex than first thought by Detective Keith Frazier. The bank's owner appears to have his own dark secrets that may be dug up by the robbers, and sends Ms Fix-It (Foster) to negotiate it further. We are also shown the nasty side to the supposed good guys; Lee adopts a post-9/11 attitude, dealing with racial stereotypes of Asian New Yorkers. One such unlucky fellow is thought to be an Arabic terrorist when he emerges from the bank as a freed hostage, only to tell everyone that he's actually a Sikh.The main problem with Inside Man is that as it goes on, the plot holes become more evident. By the final third it seems as though the story has been wrapped up, yet we are still here. At 129 minutes it outstays it's welcome, but for all its faults it is still a darn good, very tense thriller, with a knockout cast and New York maestro director.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Is Jewish holocaust THE only tragedy of human history?,"While the movie is entertaining I am sick of the misery of Jews being exploited for the political purposes that ""The Holocuast industry"" that Hollywood is a big part of serves, i.e., pro-Israeli lobby. Is there no tragedy in human history or at present other than the Jewish holocaust that is worth presenting or is it mandatory that every movie that is going to talk about any human atrocity MUST talk about only the Jews from the Nazi holocaust? First of all, there have been many a tragedy in human history (and present) and this is not the only one to make multiple movies around each year. Secondly, even in the Nazi holocaust there were 6 million OTHERS than Jews who are deliberately and strategically absent in all these movies. PLEASE READ ""THE HOLOCAUST INDUSTRY"" as it very nicely explains all the facts and politics behind this exploitation of Jewish misery by the right wing (to the extent that I find myself reacting to the mention of it instead of the sadness and disgust one should feel at such a human tragedy, just like 9/11 being exploited by the U.S. govt. makes it difficult to remember the tragedy and not only react to the political exploitation of it).",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Great!,"I just loved this film, it had great energy from the word go. The casting was superb especially Clive Owen and Spike Lee did a great job directing. Most importantly though i think the storyline was really watertight and was'nt at all predictable which is usually the downfall of a lot of films nowadays. I felt Jodie Foster could of maybe played a bigger part and there could of been more attention payed to the robbers as opposed to the cops especially towards the end. But these were noticeably the only downfalls of the film. I don't usually rate films this highly but i felt after watching it that Spike Lee and the writer really pulled it out of the bag on this one. Go and see it!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
I wanted to like it more.,"In the way all orgasms are some kind of wonderful except occasionally they can be disappointing, this was disappointing. This is a good movie but I want better than good from Mr. Lee and this cast. The acting is fine although Mr. Washington is too familiar (didn't I see this guy in the one with the terrorists in New York and the one with him in a Hawaiian shirt in Florida), Ms. Foster is set cleverly against previous type yet distracting because of that in a way Mr. Washington wasn't distracting against type in Training Day, and Clive Owens seems wasted in the few moments we actually see him. The heist hook is clever but not fully explored, the few action sequences are nicely Hollywood and the plot keeps engorging but is ultimately a bit too flaccid to be penetrating. There is a little gem at the end but as I walked out of the theater I was thinking, ""Was that it?""",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A very decent bank robbery,"A pretty decent thriller; even if the movie is a bit long and the plot a bit slow, it still achieves an entertaining result.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Spike Lee Chooses His Words Very Carefully...,"Have you ever heard someone play the first seven notes of a piano scale... and then stop? It's irritating isn't it? Spike Lee's ""Inside Man"" is like a spectacular flash of lightning and the moments immediately after when you are waiting for a thunderous boom... and you wait, and wait, and wait, only to realize that it's not coming.One could safely describe this film as the anatomy of a perfect heist... A bank robbery so perfectly planned that it almost reeks of being too good to be possible. It is the set-up, the execution, the police response, the interplay between the two, the sub-plots and typical Spike Lee touches that make this film one of the finest three-quarters of a film this year. It is just that darn final act which fizzles in comparison to the electric build-up.Clive Owen is rigidly organized and controlled as the mastermind of this bank robbing team. The plan seems simple enough... Dress the team as painters, enter a Manhattan bank branch, overpower the patrons and employees and take the loot. Right? Wrong. It's never that easy, otherwise they wouldn't have made a film about it.Once inside, the cops swarm the exterior, led by the 1950's film-noir-styled detective played with debonair cool and muffled intensity by Denzel Washington. He is an ambitious cop with legal troubles of his own and he knows that this hostage negotiation could be his big break.Christopher Plummer plays the founder and CEO of the bank in question. He is under extreme duress when hearing of the heist because of some very secretive safety deposit box contents that could damage his reputation. He hires Jodie Foster's Madeleine White, a facilitator of solutions to such problems.The story unfolds in ways that would be unfair of me to divulge to first time viewers. Needless to say, there is a David Mamet like complexity to the proceedings that allows for twists and turns and misdirection.The cast is stellar. Washington, Owen and Foster are all in fine form, each delivering a character with wit and insight and each possessing a different kind of power. There is confidence brimming over in this cast. No one feels out of place.What is absolutely brilliant about this film is the way in which Spike Lee manages to build the film to such a crescendo using a very familiar formula. One of the characters even references the classic seventies flick, ""Dog Day Afternoon"". Lee manages to craft virtually everything for the first ninety minutes to perfection. No detail or plot hole is left to bother us. The viewer is crystal clear what is happening and we get a good sense of where every character resides during this stand-off.The only thing we don't know is how the film is going to resolve itself. Unfortunately, it is at that point that we start to realize that Spike Lee may have the same problem. I will not give anything away in regards to the plot, but I will say that the final act is untidy and unsatisfying considering the meticulousness of the build-up.I want to stress that I am absolutely not clamoring for a typical Hollywood ending here. A shoot-out would not be the way to end such crafty thriller. What is needed is a crisp re-write to clarify the positions of all involved... especially the Jodie Foster character.I felt like I was waiting for that chill-down-my-spine moment that never came. The big reveal. Instead, the film felt slightly anticlimactic and predetermined... Like there was nothing at stake all along. I am giving the film a strong grade in spite of that final fade because it had the makings of one of the best films of the year up until that point.TC Candler IndependentCritics.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Clive Owen does a very good, laid back 'bad guy', But is he a bad guy. It's one of the questions for most of the film I was asking.

Excellent Movie,"Well the movie was excellent. Great actors, Great play. I just wont to make a comment on a special feature inserted in the movie. It is about the Albanian president voice and the lady who played the Albanian lady. It was good to have Albania mentioned in it. Yes it is a small country and in many other places Albania is famous for negative examples. But, believe me, Albania is a small country, with fast development and great people. I could see in the movie that the Albanian lady was played but a non Albanian girl. We do not speak English like Rusians do. We are very good at Foreinger languages. And we try to be correct (like paying bills for examples or fines). And the lady was dressed as a prostitute. No, not all girls of Albania dress like that. It is just a small percentage of it, mostly young girls. If it is possible i would like to talk to the director of the movie. He can write me an e-mail in my e-mail address: blerta12@gmail.com.

"Overall, a good flick","For a movie that was ""just another heist/hostage movie"", this was done very well. While the ending was a bit unsatisfying, the rest of the film was enjoyable. I contribute a lot of this to Spike Lee, the film was shot very well and had a certain style that kept the movie interesting. The actors did their job excellently and gave the movie a realistic feel. The script wasn't that strong but it wasn't weak and it was enough to keep me interested. There were certain holes which are examined in other comments but they don't really subtract from the film. It's a given that in a movie like this there are bound to be a few holes and if you aren't too critical, things should be just fine.All in all, I gave this movie a solid 8.

It made me feel like a hostage.,"This movie is the pits. I should have known better. Denzel Washington hasn't made a good movie in 15 years. Spike Lee hasn't made a good movie...ever. Put those two together and you get a mega-mess of a movie. The camera never stops moving. The music never stops playing. Lee is from New York but you would never know that from watching this movie. All of his ""New Yorkers"" are corny, stereotypes with unbelievable accents. The plot itself is so contrived and silly that you don't care about any of the characters. Jodie Foster is totally wasted in a rather minor role. Chistopher Plummer is no spring chicken but he is still 15 years too young to be playing his character. Inside Man was a never ending, mind numbing experience. I saw this with three friends and we all hated this bomb. It will have a good opening weekend then quickly fade away as word of mouth spreads.

"""My name is Dalton Russell. Pay strict attention to what I say because I choose my words carefully and I never repeat myself. ""","One of the most over-done genres of film is the heist movie. They used to be great, with spectacular ones like 'Dog Day Afternoon' and 'The Usual Suspects'. Hell, my favorite movie of all time 'Reservoir Dogs' surrounded the after-math of a heist. In recent years they have ranged in quality from average to terrible and just when I had given up on that as a genre, along comes 'Inside Man'. Not since 2001's 'Ocean's Eleven' have I seen a heist movie so intense, original and solid as 'Inside Man'. Usually I don't care for Spike Lee, but he really does a nice job with this.I can't really tell you anything elaborate about the plot without spoiling it for you, so I'll tell you it surrounds a New York City bank robbery lead by Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) and the detective running the operation to stop him is the cocky, slick, fancy hat wearing Detective Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington). From there, the action starts. The acting is nothing short of excellent with stunning performances by Washington, Owen, Jodie Foster, Christopher Plummer, Willem Dafoe and Chitwetel Ejiofor. The story is unpredictable and original, and I actually admired the cinematography, the editing and Spike Lee's innovative direction.'Inside Man' will have you pinned to your seat at some points, laughing hysterically at the puns of the characters at points and will have you frantically guessing through-out the entire run of the film. It's not as powerful as Lee's '25th Hour' which I highly praised, but it's very original and something of good value. I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to escape from most of the puke-inducing foul garbage that seems to be produced by Hollywood more and more often these days.

Definitely one of his WORST acts I have seen. Clive Owen has a terrible accent and has no weight or presence for the role he plays!

Today I bring you a pearl of action.In this film we have big names in the cinema, lots of action, excellent story, negotiation with hostages (which I particularly like to watch), and mainly, Denzel Washington acting a lot with a very well built character.From the already consecrated Spike Lee, I don't need to say that this film brings a sensational and engaging story. The characters, story, action scenes and humor are balanced and harmonious, the part less grounded in reality, more incredible so to speak, is placed with subtlety, which brings a lot of naturalness to the plot.The pace of the film also goes very well, it captures you easily at the beginning, and it goes on strong throughout the plot.

One of the best heist movies for a very long time,"One of the greatest pleasures the cinema can afford is the well-orchestrated heist movie. Unfortunately, they don't come around often enough so who would have thought that one of the best for a very, very long time would come from none other than Spike Lee. This is unquestionably Lee's most commercial movie to date. That he has carried it off with such consummate skill, while at the same time diluting his own political attitudes hardly at all, is quite an achievement. In other words, he hasn't sold out and has made one hell of an entertainment into the bargain.The film begins with Clive Owen talking direct to camera and telling us he is going to rob a bank, setting out the who and the why. The how is the movie that follows. Lee cuts straight to the chase and the opening scenes of the robbery are brilliantly detailed. The plot's a real tease. We know from the outset that this is no conventional robbery. We are in a hostage situation from the word go and when the robbers start demanding a getaway plane ... well, we've been down this road before. But as hostage negotiator Denzel Washington tells Owen, 'Didn't you see ""Dog Day Afternoon""?' In other words, bank robbers don't really expect planes to fly them to God-knows-where with a pile of people they didn't really want in the first place. The fun is in figuring out what is going on. And the plot twists are as nifty as they come: a brilliant device are the flash-forwards to the hostages being interrogated by Washington and partner Chiwetel Ejiofor. Are these clues or just red-herrings? In a movie like this the element of surprise is everything and Lee, working from a first-rate script by Russell Gewirtz, keeps us guessing.As the louche, lippy detective in charge, Washington is excellent. He looks like he's having fun. And Jodie Foster is terrific as ... well, let's just say her CV would make very interesting reading. The part could just as easily have been written for a man but whereas a man would simply have been a sleazy villain, Foster manages to be both charming and sexy; (she's a charming and sexy piranha fish, as she says, her bite is worse than her bark).Often movies like this tend to run out of steam before the end. Once we know the denouement things have a tendency to dip but Lee keeps it ticking along nicely for a coda that should send you out of the cinema with a reasonably wide grin on your well satisfied chops.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
I can see why it's free on Netflix.,"A good cast of talented actors couldn't save this movie. There was a clever story in there somewhere, but the forced attempts at being clever got in the way of the story telling. The irritating camera work also made this very difficult to watch. The incredibly irritating opening credit score was a red flag that something might he wrong here. If you make it through that, give it a chance. Its watchable, but hardly memorable. Most of the actors performances felt quite disconnected - isolated from the other actor sharing the scene. I almost turned the movie off during the obnoxiously annoying performance by the guy whining about his turban, it went on far longer than required. The exception here is Christopher Plummer, his solid acting provides some life to the movie, and he engages both his fellow actor and the audience masterfully.",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Unique Story,"Solid bank robbery flick with lots of twists, which isn't easy when the physical layout is relatively small.Here's my breakdown:STORY:
This is a unique take on ""robbing a bank."" Normally, film censorship would ban a film depicting this, but
that's part of the twisting going on here.Overall it's a good story but there are some gaping holes that you either suspend, or they dilute the fun.Frankly, I hate story holes, but that's why this is not a perfect story.My chief complaint is streaming of cliches in the story end-to-end, and the promotional ads.These soiled things for me.ACTING:
The acting is as you'd expect with this cast - solid. My complaint here is there's some over-acting going
on, and that was distracting. As a whole everyone did fine, but no stand outs.ENTERTAINMENT:
Moderate to high value depending on your tastesTEMPO:
Very-well paced but there are some unnecessary scenes, and a few that went on far too long (cliche crap)CINEMATOGRAPHY:
Not a lot to seeDIRECTING / WRITING:
Director: Lee is a good director and I appreciate the African-American slant on this. I didn't find a lot of
issues, but neither was I amazed at the work either. I do have one major complaint, and it may not have been
Lee's fault, but that's with the ad placements. Come on ... Lee. You can do better.Writers: Only three (3) feature films, and this was the first. Nice work for a first try.Is it a good film?

Was expecting a tense, intelligent thriller, something a la 'The Usual Suspects', though that was probably expecting a bit much. When you look back, what the hell actually happened after the initial hold up and capture of the hostages. The cops flail around outside for what seems like an eternity while the audience, who have coped on ages before what Clive Owen actually has in mind, twiddle their thumbs and wonder what IQ is required to get into the police force. There is no element of surprise, no twist, no tension and unfortunately no connection with any of the characters, apart from Owen who is engaging enough.

"goes a little long not knowing when to end, but it is a genuinely clever crowd pleaser","Inside Man has the appeal of a slick, cool, not-too-old used car. You know certain things will definitely be there, but you also are hoping some things might be surprising. Spike Lee isn't doing an incredible subversion of the heist picture, particularly the bank-heist picture, but he is putting his mark on it, and this split between common Hollywood stylistics and a personal vision make it a fine little piece of studio film-making. There's also a story at work here, one that does develop the ensemble (mostly of hostages, and cops, and others), while also developing in a way that, at the least, isn't too boring. There may be a lot of elements going on in the film surrounding this bank robbery, and its questionable if the focus isn't on one thing the whole time. But if Lee can do one thing quite well, it's making sure the pieces fit, most of the time.His cast is all top-notch, with his on/off again acting collaborator Denzel Washington in his smart, always interesting form as the hostage negotiator. He's up against Clive Owen's Don, head of a few really well-planned (he calls it the ""perfect bank robbery"") robbers, who've taken a heap of people hostage. Owen, to me, has one of his better performances, not an easy feat being under a mask and glasses through most of his role, but his voice (as usual deep and brooding in his English way) is dead-on and threatening. There's also Jodie Foster and Christopher Plummer as the 'special interests' looking out for something that happens to be in a certain safety deposit box. If I'm being a little vague then its for the purpose of the viewer; this isn't a twist that just comes out of nowhere, and it could be argued to not even be a real 'twist'.One of the things that had me really attentive was knowing how the structure of the story would go after a while, the bits of general unpredictability of when a flash-forward (err, Denzel's interviews with the ex-hostages), and how it carried a similar lighting scheme to Lee's Clockers. It's a very good lighting set-up. And, like Scorsese with the Aviator, in this very prominent big-studio budget, Lee is able to put in little nods to the audience that this is still his 'joint'. Even if the screenwriter, Russel Gurwitz, doesn't have the focus always together, and after the climax there are a few too many exposition-type scenes, the last scene does give a nice grin to most in the audience. In fact, this is a terrific film to see in a packed theater, as I had the chance to have, as there are more than a few really funny moments interspersed with the more thrilling cat & mouse scenes. Inside Man plays on clich√©s in a way that reminds me of the Usual Suspects, and done in its own slick, used-car way that wont really break down, for most.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"INSIDE MAN (Spike Lee, 2006) ***","This is only my third Spike Lee movie (the others being DO THE RIGHT THING [1989] and MALCOLM X [1992]), but I'd say that it's his most atypical film to date - a very enjoyable and smartly-written thriller which, thankfully, does not take itself too seriously and besides features a good cast in fine form (Denzel Washington and Jodie Foster, the latter cast against type, are particularly impressive). The throwback half-way through to MARATHON MAN (1976) territory is unexpected and not totally convincing, however, especially since Clive Owen's real motives are kept from the spectator. There's the occasional caper/police procedural clich√©, too, to be sure - but, overall, the film manages to work around them in clever and original ways. Also, while the film deals with Washington's family life from time to time, it's mercifully left in the background and doesn't get in the way of the main plot. Lee's direction is needlessly flashy at times, but one can't really blame him for playing the Hollywood game when given a big budget and a specific genre to work in.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Inside Man,"""Inside Man"", a Spike Lee joint film, is the story of what appears to be the perfect bank robbery. It is up to a hostage negotiating detective (Denzel Washington)to resolve the situation. While working with the head of the gang (Clive Owen), the detective's instincts begin to tell him that there is more to the crime than stealing the bank's reserves. When a corporate fund raiser (Jodi Foster) becomes involved in the investigation on the behalf of the bank owner (Christopher Plummer) who is worried more about the contents of a mysterious safety deposit box than the money in his bank, the facts begin to fall in place for the detective.The film is an entertaining adventure that contains Lee's patented look at the race relations issue at a subdued level. The dialogue is excellent and the plot is well executed. Washington's performance is sensational, giving the audience a character that is interesting as well as entertaining. Clive Owen is brilliant in the combination of head bank robber and corrupted vigilante. The supporting cast of hostages/bank robbers add a touch of hilarity and realism to the film. Christopher Plummer is excellent, playing the villain that has wrapped himself in good deeds to hide from a past driven by greed and wealth painted in blood.The only disappointment is Jodi Foster. The audience sees her as an opportunistic, favor swapping heavy that has no depth. There is no back story given or implied as to why people in high power positions bow to her whim. Her occupation and character are not well defined. Although she is needed as a link to key elements of the story line between robber and detective, she lacks the compelling aspect of a character that makes people sit up and watch a film. When Jodi Foster is on the screen, the rhythm of the film wavers and loses focus.""Inside Man"" is definitely worth seeing.

And right from the word go it does not disappoint, as you thrown straight away into the action and one excellent thing was that you got to learn a bit about the characters as the film rolled on and did not stop for anything. Clive Owen was nothing short of brilliant as a smart, witty and ultra cool bank robber with Denzel at the other end pulling his weight as well. The other cast members like Defoe, and Foster not to mention Owen's team done a very good job. The film as it stands on its own was nothing short of fantastic as Spike Lee leaves you lost in it. Although it was an action/thriller movie it still had its bits of sharp humour which was most welcoming as well as being a smart taking an odd twist or turn and not leaving the viewer confused . I would love to go further into it and explain the film but I feel that might be giving a bit away, so my advice to you is check out the trailer , then the film and I promise you it will be time well spent ! To sum it up Inside Man is a clever, caper flick which has been very well directed and brought together, but if you don't believe me , check it out for your-self. Personally I'm waiting for Lee to roll another class act up like this one.INSIDE MAN - 8.6 OUT OF 10, FOR NOW THIS IS THE SHADOWMAN WISHING YOU GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK !",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Very enjoyable fluff.,"Although I found it a little long, the performances of Denzel Washington and Clive Owen really make this film sing. Jodie Foster I was less crazy about- I had a hard time believing that she'd just keep on smiling no matter what potentially dangerous situation she was in.The music and photography seem a throwback to the 70's, which I didn't mind. The plot punishes all the right people, and the screenplay is very smart.The woman who played Denzel's fianc√© seemed a bit of a fantasy figure, never really wanting anything but sex- but I didn't mind that!And of course, Spike Lee's signature 'he's walking but he's not and I'm getting dizzy' shot is in the mix as well.A fun romp if you're in the mood for a bank heist film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
a decent by-the-numbers heist flick,"Inside Man is a decent enough film to rent on DVD on a wet Friday. The main intrigue comes from figuring out who the bad guys were. All the other sub-plots - where Owen disappeared to, how Washington will win his power game with Foster, what order Dafoe will give when it all goes pear-shaped - are either telegraphed early on or lack dramatic tension. Also, pay too much attention and some glaring plot holes reveal themselves. But, there is some crisp dialogue, a few laughs, and the always (well sometime, in the case of Owen) charismatic cast to enjoy. Apart from a couple of asides about colour-prejudiced comments, the only thing that tells you this is a Spike Lee joint is the credit roll. Intriguingly, there is one excruciatingly embarrassing moment when a female-specific (in the US of A, that is) expletive is aimed at Foster. Lee has been eloquent and accurate in his condemnation of Tarantino's over-fondness for using language that discriminates against African-Americans: all the more the pity, then, that he chooses to so clumsily deploy similar language tactics for gender bias. I get the feeling Lee made this film to prove a point, in order to show that he can be a decent genre filmmaker, on a par with Soderbergh in Out-of-Sight mode. Well, he made his point. I for one would like him to get back to doing what he does best, making polemical films about issues that matter.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"a worthwhile crime film with an interesting plot, good music, and great acting","Spike Lee's 'Inside Man' has a very recycled theme, the bank robbery. But this particular bank robbery film is much different, because it manages to keep you interested for every minute, with the 3 main stars, Clive Owen in particular, giving wonderful performances. The music is the classic good guy versus bad guy type, and even though it seems corny, you'll like it. With a stellar director, excellent writing, and a star studded cast including Oscar winners Denzel Washington and Jodie Foster and Oscar nominee Clive Owen, Inside Man, as of this writing, is the best crime film of the year.Dalton Russell (Owen) believes he's planned the perfect bank robbery, as he tells us in the opening scene of the film. I won't tell you exactly how he's done this, because that ruins the surprise of how well organized the heist is. Keith Frazier (Washington), a troubled NYPD detective, says otherwise. Meanwhile, the bank's owner (Christopher Plummer) believes that one of his most sacred possessions is in danger, so he taps the help of Madeline White (Foster), a smooth and persuasive business woman who seems to have a certain dark mystery about her...First off, the shows the 3 main stars put on is fabulous, with Clive Owen leading the pack, followed by Jodie Foster, then Washington. Owen delivers an Oscar worthy performance as the mastermind of the heist, because even though his face is sealed for a good part of the film, he delivers each line with a quiet voice, yet a voice that says, 'I'm in charge, and if you get in my way, I will crush you'. He is in control the whole film, making you wonder what he'll do next. This is the best villainous performance in a non-fantasy film I've seen recently. One cannot help but be in awe of Jodie Foster in this film, because while Clive Owen has control of everything inside, she seems to have control of everything else with her smooth words and seemingly effortless charisma. It is easy to see why her character is such a mysterious character, even more mysterious than the villain of the film. Denzel Washington has not delivered a bad movie since 1995, and the streak doesn't end here. As the star of the film, he does command the screen just as you expect him to do. It's a different turn for Denzel, as we're used to seeing him play strong willed characters with a seemingly unbeatable attitude. Washington does a great job playing a character that is flawed, apprehensive, and well...human. Also in the film are Christopher Plummer, Chiwetel Ejiofor as Washington's partner, and Willem Dafoe as a police captain. All three deliver strong performances, but none of an overwhelming amount of screen time, so it doesn't particularly matter.Spike Lee is a great director who's given us a ton of great films for the ages (not to mention classic moments at New York Knicks games), and Inside Man is no different. He captures the mystery of the story extremely well, but he also maintains a certain 'cool factor' by throwing in really clever lines and funny situations that keep the film from becoming too serious. I loved the writing here as well, as it'll keep you guessing until the end of the film. It's got one of those endings that you'll either love or hate, sort of how 2004's Collateral made you feel (for the record, the endings of the two movies are NOT similar, I'm just describing the feeling). When all is said and done, 'Inside Man' deserves to go down as one of the best crime films of recent memory. I enjoyed it a lot, and I hope you do too.9/10 --spy",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Never exhilarating , yet constantly engrossing","Inside Man is one of the cleverest, classiest Hollywood movies in a long time, yet it never really get's terribly exciting, nor terribly bad. It seems for the most part to be a damn good, damn interesting entertainment. Most of the reasons, for those who's like to know, come from the fact that it's directed by Spike Lee, a man not completely at home with doing Hollywood mainstream pictures. As a result nothing is really as it seems in Inside Man, nor really does the film know what it is. Is it a thriller? Is it a drama? Is it a racial/political dissection of society today (a subject it bizarrely delves into)? In fact Inside Man is rare breed of cross-genre cinema. Still with us? OK.When a group organised robbers (led by Clive Owen's Dalton Russel) attempt to take over the New York trust bank, inexperienced detectives Frazier (Washington) and Mitchell (Britain's Chewiel Ejoifor) are sent to try and relieve the situation. Soon there's more to the robbery than it seems, as bank owner Christopher Plummer (the captain from The Sound of Music) discovers the robbers may be after one of his gems locked deep in that very bank. So he hires the suitably deceitful Madeline White (Foster) to sort things out.Yet as the plot twists and turns, nothing really happens to make the heart leap a beat. The excitement level remains pretty constant and although we have flashbacks, flash-forwards and even some flash-bang grenades, it's seems so clever it can't really get off the ground. However there's much to take away from Inside Man. The performances on the whole are spot on ¬ñ Clive Owen ¬ñ a particularly changeable actor (great in Closer, rubbish in King Arthur) particularly underplays his part to perfection. Jodie Foster is also superb as the mighty Manhattan bitch who's back-room deals and subtle conniving tries to outwit the brains of the aforementioned Owen. Denzel Washington, while never going lengths to add anything to his part, is also fine as the NYPD man making sense of the situation.The plot, featuring everything from Albanians, boob sizes to Nazis (yes, Nazis) is clever to a certain point, but starts to lose much of the groundwork it made towards the end. It rollicks its way through the first hour and a half before screenwriter Russell Gewirtz seems to have made a hash of a potentially great conclusion (e.g. what happened to Willem Dafoe?). And yet it seems Spike Lee maybe trying to make a point, be it political or ethical through Inside Man. He frequently points out stereotypical racism (arabs are terrorists, etc) or even that there's more to life than money (Washington's Frazier says from the start that the robbers don't want cash ¬ñ ""Who ever heard of a bank robbers escaping on a plane with fifty hostages? This ain't no bank robbery!""). If there was a subplot to be found it's dissolved by the cluster of events in the story. Owen points out at the start ""pay strict attention to what I say because I choose my words carefully and never repeat myself"" and that's exactly what you've got to do. The events go so quickly that you'll be forgiven for losing track early on. However, if you do keep track 'til the end Inside Man is a rewarding, if bewildering experience.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Great Movie to Watch Unfold,"I enjoyed watching Inside Man. I thought it was an overall great movie with direction from Spike Lee getting a thumbs up and the all star cast of Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster and Clive Owen playing characters brilliantly.Washington's character was my favourite, his personality combining a passion for his work and very witty remarks. I think Denzel really plays his roles well and there was no lacking in this movie.At times, Spike Lee can be a little annoying. I don't think he can really quite get the dialogue right with white people, but most of his shots were done very well.The movie has many great plot twists which are a privilege to watch unfold.I give Inside Man an 8 out of 10. If only we could fix the few weaknesses than the film would get an easy 10 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Politics Disguised,"I have been a fan of Spike Lee's films for many years, and his latest offering did not disappoint. His message was not as obvious to suburban W.A.S.P. America as his previous offerings, however the critical shots in the film were just as striking as the lynching scene in Do The Right Thing or Edward Norton's rant in 25th Hour.The plot was straightforward for a heist film, with the entire cinematic value being placed in the current political moment. The scene where the bank is cleared out evokes the problems of identification faced by Security and Military personnel. By not making the people readily identifiable, Lee manages to evoke a sense of identification with any group easily identified, and thereby discriminated against, for having a unifying physical characteristic. Rather than focusing on the problems specific to the black community, Lee manages to transcend his past as a filmmaker without being overly heavy on the social preaching.Overall, the film was well-executed. Jodie Foster was underutilized, but then again, is she ever over-utilized in a film? Regardless of your personal feelings toward Mrs. Foster's acting, she was one of many talented actors giving incredible, impeccable performances. If you enjoyed Denzel Washington in Training Day, you're going to find his performance was not as good, but definitely more satisfying. The balance of acting and racial undertones make this film far more interesting than typical popcorn, we-gonna-steal-stuff celluloid.I give it 9 Safety Deposit Boxes out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"A fun movie, but not as good as ""Dog Day Afternoon""","Inside Man is a good crime/thriller, but there are better movies in the genre. The director does a great job of keeping the bank robbers mysterious, and their motives hidden. The criminals in this film are very smart, and use some original and ingenious methods to confuse the police. The movie maintains its atmosphere well. The script, acting, and direction are pretty good, but nothing special. The plot line with Jodie Foster's character seems unnecessary and forced at times, which is a shame as Foster is one of my favorite actresses. This movie owes a lot to ""Dog Day Afternoon"" (even directly mentioning Pacino's movie at one point) but never crosses the line between homage and rip-off. With a traditional plot points combined with some unique ideas, Inside Man is a fun and entertaining crime film.I give Inside Man 7/10.

Schizophrenia at the Multiplex,"""The Inside Man"" boasts some great lines and some stinkers. Thrilling scenes and quite long stretches that'll push you to the edge of sleep. Distinctive characters and ludicrous ones (Jodie Foster does what she can with one of the latter). Inventiveness and clich√©.Just when it your rattles your preconceptions, it settles you back down with Denzel doing Denzel, take eight (great actor, shame about the parts), and Christopher Plummer doing late-period Christopher Plummer (even greater actor, shame...). Just when it dazzles you with virtuoso film-making, it makes you tear your hair out -- it certainly seems to have made Denzel tear his out -- over an absurd McGuffin and more holes in the narrative logic than there are in the case for invading Iraq.Spike Lee has tremendous visual flair.

Excellent,"This is just a brilliantly clever film. Clive Owen is just superb I would say this is his greatest role in any of the films I have seen him in.

If you want a good day out and then a long discussion about the film trying to figure out parts of the ending with parts from the beginning then this is the film for you.

interesting thriller,"OK, so you have to suspend some belief. Was it supposed to be guilt that led someone to keep 50+ year old incriminating documents? If you can accept that, it's pretty interesting to watch and figure out what's going on.I generally like Spike Lee films, but as always he does have issues with his women. I love Jodie Foster but her character was one dimensional. There was no explanation of who she was, how she got that way or how she could wield any power. Denzel's gf despite being a cop in her own right was just shown a few times lying around in lingerie waiting for him to come home while he's busy working on a huge hostage situation. The trampy gum smoking Albanian immigrant. I guess I should feel glad that the hostage woman was ignored, except of course for them trying to identify her by her bust size.Overall, it was worth watching. It gave enough clues so you could try to figure stuff out, but also kept you guessing til the end. As usual, there's some small moments highlighting racial issues (I liked the commentary on ""Grand Theft Auto"" game that encourages violence and sexism) or a Sikh victim being automatically treated as a criminal/terrorist. I also liked the fact that they had a diverse multiracial, cross gender/cross age group of robbers.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
unconventional heist thriller,"Vibrant cast, clever script and great acting. Spike Lee has never dashed his fan's expectations, he's one of the best directors around. This story has some implausibilities but the tension is always high and the themes handled such as social classes, race questions make it outstanding. Like in ""The 25th Hour"" he deals with ethics, morality and adds surprises and twists.

Entertaining to a point,"When is a bank robbery not a bank robbery? That is the million dollar question in Spike Lee's INSIDE MAN, a tricky crime thriller starring Denzel Washington and Clive Owen. Bad guy Owen is holding 50 people hostage during what appears to be the robbery of a Manhattan-based bank, and Washington is a stressed-out, possibly larcenous detective who must talk Owen into releasing the hostages and giving himself up. The first half of INSIDE MAN is a gritty, fast-paced crime yarn, while the second is an intellectual exercise in piecing together just what happened while the bank was under siege. INSIDE MAN is Washington's film all the way, a huge improvement over OUT OF TIME, his last outing as a stressed-out, possibly larcenous law enforcer. Everyone else -- Owen as the bank robber-not-bank-robber, WIllem Dafoe as a fellow cop, Christopher Plummer as the bank's shady president and Jodie Foster as an even shadier ""fixer"" who poses as a real estate mogul -- plays second fiddle to Washington in this one. Is INSIDE MAN a must-see? Not by a long shot, especially with a second half that crawls to the finish and distracting cinematography as the film jumps back and forth in time. Is it a compelling bank heist yarn? Not really, once we understand the bigger picture, which unfortunately is telegraphed early on. But the movie should make for a pleasant, nothing-else-to-do kind of evening viewing, if nothing else just to watch Washington in action.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.    Previews revealed what I thought was going to be a great plot.    Story  dragged on and on and on and failed miserably in the climax.,"Brother Spike showed his usual heavy handed directing. His philosophy seems to be to replace quality dialog with gutter language. The premise of having the hostages dress like the crooks showed promise, but the actual script fell FLAT. The character played by Denzel Washington (a fine actor) should have been an excellent protagonist, but the script (or directing) failed miserably in developing a person that we could emotionally relate to. Very disappointed in the entire storyline. Jody Foster (a superb actress)did what she could with the script. I asked myself: Could Miss Foster's entire part been replaced by a conversation between a couple of terrorist? I think so. Sorry, I can't go along with the majority who gave this movie a 7+ rating.

Absolutely Wonderful!,"I saw this film tonight at the cinema and WOW! What can I say, without doubt, this is one of the best suspense/drama films to have come out in a long time! From beginning to end, it keeps you guessing, teasing you with events and bits and pieces of plot that get you wanting more and more! The story unfolds at a wonderful pace, giving you hints and clues in all the appropriate places, but still managing to keep you guessing right up to the end.What I found so appealing about this film was that, not only is the plot-line great, but also very mysterious and difficult to interpret while watching. The acting is another highlight; the angst between Denzel Washington's and Clive Owen's characters is immense, and really adds to the sense of tension and drama.When I saw the trailer for this film, I couldn't help but think 'great, another one of THOSE films,' and only had a slight interest in seeing it, but after hearing of such critical acclaim I thought I'd give it a try and it is well worth it!Overall this film is cool, calm, collected and very slick. The only let down that can be mentioned is some of the camera movement, the 360 degree panning around a room may cause slight dizziness! But more importantly, this film is absolutely wonderful and while tension and suspense are the main object of the film, it even has a few laughs! Well worth seeing!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

A pretty neat Spike Lee feature,"Spike Lee has finally crafted a heist thriller that is new and fresh, plus feels intelligent.

Let down,I thoroughly enjoyed the movie until the end. They build up this great story and there is all this tension and then...it ends. I felt cheated. I mean until the end the movie was fantastic and then to have something that simple was a let down. The best example I can think of is to compare everything until the end as Ocean's 11 and the end be called Ocean's 12. Anywho I still think you should go see it just don't be surprised at how much of a letdown the end is.

Entertaining heist film,"I can't really say this heist film stands out in the genre, but it's entertaining and has a star-studded cast. There are nice moments, like the Sikh bank worker who points out the harassment he receives in a post-9/11 world, and some stupid ones, like the detectives ogling the women with large breasts. There is cleverness in the mastermind's plan as we see it gradually revealed, but there are some head scratching moments in character motivations along the way. There is something pretty subversive in how it's all resolved, if you think about what happens to the detective, the bank president, and the criminals, and yet it also feels a little unsatisfying too, maybe because the historical crime isn't completely avenged (in fact, it's re-perpetrated). I simultaneously wish the film had been pared down and that a little more effort had been put into developing its characters, even though those desires pull in opposite directions. It's interesting to see Spike Lee's spin on a mainstream film, and even if imperfect, it's worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Not great - One for the netflix queue.,"It's hard making a good a movie - Fact! Spike Lee, has made some good movies over the years, but sad to say this is not one of them. 'Inside Man' entertains in part, but never really finds it's feet. There were many things I didn't like about this movie, but mainly just the obvious plot-holes, and bad pacing/editing. The movie also dealt with the underlying racism within New York city, in an obvious, crude way- Which didn't help or have any relevance to the story. Who knows, you may like this film.

Good thriller/heist movie,"Spike Lee has realized that he's getting a bit too old to pull an Orson Welles in his films, starring/directing/writing etc. This is a bit too much to pull off without sacrificing some quality (compare Woody Allen's last two efforts, and figure out which one was the lesser). Like ""clockers"" or ""the 25th hour"", Lee is able to work with some great actors on someone else's screenplay, leaving him to direct a film that rings true in all the details and textures of New York, and New Yorkers.

Spike Lee's Hit Came Close To A Miss,"Is INSIDE MAN supposed to be a mindlessly stimulating bank heist film? Or a thought-provoking take on urbanism, race, money, power, and history? Blending the two would've been a spectacular feat, but INSIDE MAN too often misses the mark or simply stretches credibility to the breaking point.The story starts like a basic heist flick but with a few subtle quirks. Clive Owen stars as bank robber genius Dalton Russell who takes over a bank in Manhattan, hostages and all. But why he's there is the big running question. He makes no move to dash in and out with the money, and seems content to sit and wait out the police.Enter Denzel Washington as Junior Detective Keith Frazer. Being a hostage negotiator, the detective decides to play by the book, waiting out Dalton's gang and making false promises of arriving buses and planes. But Detective Frazer soon realizes that something is amiss. Dalton is delaying everything, too. And none of the hostages have been killed, even when deadline demands come and go.Into the fray comes Christopher Plummer as Arthur Case, the banks founder. He has secrets in a safety deposit box that he'll do anything to keep secret. In rapid (and confusing) fashion, he contacts Madeline White (Jodi Foster, FLIGHTPLAN ), a woman who has contacts in high places and can usually get whatever a client wants. Bending the ear of the mayor, Ms. White gets on the inside with the police and secures a private meeting with Dalton, who quickly advises her that he's already opened Mr. Case's safety deposit box and retrieved ....Okay, I'm not going to let the cat out of the bag.Suffice to say there are good qualities about the film (thus my positive rating). The acting is spot-on perfect (from Willem Dafoe's grumpy street cop persona to Clive Owen's questionable bank robber status). Filming was exceptional with director Spike Lee incorporating the darkness inside the bank in contrast to the white masks of the hostage-takers/robbers (White masks? Hmm. Think he's trying to tell us something?) The movie's pace was satisfactory, too. It perhaps got bogged down in some of the overly-developed plot devices that were extraneous or outlandish (the cops would NEVER let a citizen ¬ó Foster ¬ó into the bank with armed suspects regardless of her contacts).There are also a lot of irritatingly undeveloped items. Most notably were Jodi Foster's character and the basis for Clive Owen's gang. There is no history surrounding Foster's character so we don't know how she got started in this business (whatever her ""business"" was) nor how Christopher Plummer's character knows how to get ahold of her. Clive Owen's gang must've been some sort of modern day Nurembergers, still tracking down Nazi and Nazi sympathizers, but why and where they came from remains a mystery throughout.In recent typical Hollywood fashion, the good guys aren't so good and the bad guys are better than all. Christopher Plummer plays the dark figure we so love to see him play that it is, unfortunately, almost a clich√©. Denzel is the black detective trying to advance his career while at the same time battling prejudice within his own department (another clich√©?).Still, it was fun to watch. The fact that there's really no bloodshed makes this bank heist film unique by current day standards. Most have explosions with bodies flying through the air and clip after clip after clip of ammo being loosed. Not here.If you've got a few hours to kill at home, you might consider plopping this into your DVD player and checking it out. Just don't think too hard about the INSIDE MAN after it's over.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"A smart, rewarding thriller that sees Spike Lee return to form","When Empire magazine listed the 25 best movies of 2006, Inside Man was part of that list (number 19, to be more precise), and the brief review of Spike Lee's latest big screen outing read: ""First time in ages he's done the right thing!"". Now, I don't think it's the first time in years he's made a good film (I mean, what about the superb 25th Hour, which was released less than half a decade ago?), but it sure as hell marks a return to form after the interesting, but uneven, She Hate Me (2004). The problem with that movie was that it had enough material for two or three different films, with Lee trying to put it all in one flick. This time, though, he sticks to the main plot, with only one or two short digressions, thus delivering one of last year's most accessible and enjoyable films.On the surface, Inside Man may look like just another heist movie. The fact that it isn't is highlighted from the beginning, the opening sequence featuring Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) speaking straight to the camera and telling the audience he has a plan to pull off the perfect bank robbery. And within a couple of minutes from that scene, he puts his plan into action, using a very simple trick (posing as a painter) to enter a New York bank and ensure everyone cooperates. Naturally, it doesn't take that long before the NYPD is contacted and sends detective Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) to negotiate with Russell. In the meantime, someone has told the bank's owner, Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer), about the ongoing robbery, and the old man, desperate to conceal some big secret, asks a woman named Madeleine White (Jodie Foster) to help him. What was meant to be an ordinary crime has therefore become a mind game between the cop, the robber and the mysterious lady.In the hands of another filmmaker, this could have been a pretty formulaic genre film. However, this is a Spike Lee joint, so there's much more than the usual good guy/bad guy showdown. Inside Man is both exciting, funny and intelligent, Lee taking his time to briefly explore other territories as well. A scene where a Sikh hostage is mistaken for a terrorist (""Sh*t! A f*cking Arab!"") is a brilliant example of how to use (grotesque) humor to criticize the times we live in, and there's almost a Michael Mann-esquire feel to the relationship between Frazier and Russell, particularly when the two discuss the former's reluctance to getting married. Washington has plenty of fun and proves a convincing lead, even when he's making fun of himself (""I've got them right where I want'em"", he tells his partner; ""Where's that?"" ""Right behind me with my pants around my ankles, but it's a start"") and Owen is brilliant as the cunning thief, despite a less convincing American accent than the one he adopted in Sin City, because he's got the best material to work on: we don't care about his motive, partly since it's pretty clear he's not after the money, but we keep watching nonetheless, because his methods are fascinating. As for Foster, she's an intriguing presence, although the audience could have benefited from a little more insight on a woman so manipulative she's called ""a magnificent c*nt"" by the mayor of New York.So, Spike Lee may not be Christopher Nolan, and Inside Man certainly isn't Memento, but it is undoubtedly one of the most compelling films of 2006. Let's hope Lee keeps making them like this...",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A journeyman's film,"Clive Owen is a very good actor, Denzel Washington has all of the right star material and they do not a bad job in this movie made back in 2006. It's about a bank robbery in New York where nothing is robbed and no one is shot.Yeah I'm serious ..No one is shot in a New York cop movie.... say it ain't soüòÉYou'll get it when you watch the pictureI'm always mystified when they bring in a ""fixer"" in these sort of heist- come political intrigue thrillers ... Are there really people like that out there?What's 'er face Foster does a good job as the fixer and to tell the truth, from my dealings with the New York, Political and Justice system, she's probably drawn from a real life character .....so there must be fixers in the system.She doesn't have to do much though, either acting or in her role but she's pretty convincing with her business suits and elegant style.It's a movie that you have to concentrate on or you'll lose the plot because it's one of those flashback set ups where you jump from one scene to another.A pretty dreary performance from Christopher Plummer but let's not speak ill of those who have passed away.It has a few clich√©d moments in the script to keep it politically correct and it has an unnecessary side story involving the voluptuous girlfriend of Washington. But you need these things to keep it real, to raise the money and get people in to see it.The ending's a bit confusing if you don't keep your wits about you but overall it was a good way to spend 2 hours or so even though it's back from 2006.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A twisty tense heist thriller that will leave you scratching your head,"Inside Man is a clever film that fits the bill perfectly for a Saturday evening's entertainment ‚Äì a complex thriller that, while never too complicated, leaves you on numerous occasions thinking you have a handle on what is happening, only for the film to surprise you again. A classy heist thriller with modern twists, and a stellar leading cast, it keeps you guessing right the way through, which makes it ideal evening viewing, and at almost exactly two hours is probably just the right length. There seems to be hidden depths to all the characters in a multi-layered plot, where as questions are answered, even more are asked. Much discussion will ensue as the credits roll.Clive Owen plays Dalton Russell, a master criminal who has planned what he believes to be the perfect bank robbery, whilst Denzel Washington is the detective who must resolve the situation, and Jodie Foster is the big shot hard nosed negotiator working for the benefit of 'outside interests'. Supporting this A-list leading group includes Chiwetel Ejiofor (who seemed to be in nearly every film released that year), Willem Dafoe and Christopher Plummer.The film uses the interesting format of interspersing the main film with brief scenes of witness/suspect interviews in the aftermath, all the while keeping the identities of the robbers concealed (with the exception of Owen, who announces his intentions at the start) so the interviewees could be anyone. What makes the scene more interesting is the complete and very distinct lack of lawyers for the interviewees. This proves to be a rather effective and innovative technique, as are the interesting mix of sympathies. The detectives dealing with the hostage situation and the interviews in the aftermath are not necessarily as warm and heroic as you might expect, in fact almost intimidating, while Foster's power broker and Owen's lead bank-robber are multi-layered, making for much more interesting characters, especially as they are used comparatively sparingly, while Washington's detective fills a large portion of the screen time ‚Äì fortunately as a top quality actor he is equal to the task, although he does come across as slightly callous and unsympathetic. Denzel's unusual and cold characterisation makes the viewing uncomfortable for the viewer, and certainly alters the viewers sympathies. Meanwhile, Foster is particularly excellent as the ice-cold bitch negotiating on behalf of a third party, while Owen has some strangely effective cold charisma as the lead bank robber. Plummer and Dafoe are given very little to do however, while Ejiofor seems little more than a sycophantic sidekick for Washington, and he contributes nothing ‚Äì unusual given his strong performances in other films round the same time such as Serenity and Four Brothers.With the emphasis on slowly-rising tension and very little action as the mast plan of the criminals becomes clear, Inside Man is a gripping tale of how to rob a bank ‚Äì almost playing as an instruction manual for would-be armed robbers. In addition, what sets the film apart is that far from there being an obvious outcome as is the case with similar films, there seems to be a real feeling that someway, somehow, the robbers might actually get away with it and win. YOu never know what is going to happen. This makes for an incredibly refreshing film. Movie buffs will also love being able to play spot the movie reference ‚Äì Sudden Impact, Serpico and Dog Day Afternoon are all clearly referenced, almost as if the film is an homage to the great crime and heist movies of the past. Inside Man is also one of few 15-rated films that make use of the c-word.Overall a gripping heist thriller that will still have you scratching your head as the end credits roll, wondering not only how it happened, but what actually happened as well. A film that definitely warrants repeat viewings - make space on your DVD shelf, as you will want to watch it again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Not your std Bank Robbery,"Spike Lee peppers a standard master-mind bank robbery story with his socially-conscious director's eye - and the result is well worth seeing. The camera is a bit more focused on creating atmosphere than just shoving the action in your face, and characters are not what you would expect from a std production. Let's just mention black detective K.Frazier(D.Washington), with a dirty mouth and masterfully bordering on caricature (but since it is a black director shooting this, nobody will complain about political correctness!). Passing but clever and humorous social commentary on America's preconceptions works well with the action. Finally, would you nowadays expect to hear in a big-time movie somebody calling Jodie Foster a (excuse my language, but it is heard loud and clear on screen) ""magnificent c***""?",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Inside Man gets an outside audience.,"It's nice to see Spike Lee back in film-making. It's even nicer to see he can actually do a mainstream film without shoving the race card every two minutes like he does in his repertoire. Also, it shows he has the skill to handle a big budget movie with skilled actors in every type of character role.The Inside Man is a movie with a typical bank robbery plot but the scripting, camera shots, dialog and unusual plot twist in the end gives this movie a big thumbs up. Intelligently written, fast paced real life dialog, cutaway shots, and duel cameras on actors from both directions highlight this film and creates the intensity required in a small space thriller. A lot longer than it should at 129 minutes, Spike Lee's skill as a director pieces together current and flash forward scenes right from the get go to hook the audience in what should have been a typical 'bank robbery go wry' second rate TV movie.Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster, Willem Dafoe, Clive Owen, Christopher Plummer, et al, portray characters who get caught up in a bank robbery at Manhatten Trust. A bank that is chaired by CEO Christopher Plummer who has a secret to hide and hires Jodie Foster to diffuse the situation and get that secret out of the safety deposit box before the robbers snatch it. Apparently, he helped the Nazi's during WWII against his own people (Jews) and used the blood money to set up the bank. The downside is he could be charged with war crimes and lose everything if the evidence is found. Hence, the power broking from Foster on his behalf of Plummer's character ad Clive Owen's Dalton Russell, the bank robber. Denzel plays the second rate cop who is forced to handle the hostage negotiations because his predecessor suddenly isn't available. Willem Dafoe plays the head of the tactical squad used to bring the muscle to stop the robbers. Clive Owen does an excellent job as the masked hidden bank robber who is always one step ahead of the detectives (mainly due to a hidden bug).Overall, it is an excellently executed affair on what would be a typical bank robbing plot. Much of this is due to first-time screen writer, Russell Gewirtz, and the unexpected twist in the film's climax. Spike Lee's experience as an indie type filmmaker can be seen with his unique piecing of the script through flash forwards mixed in with current plot development. His skill as a director in use of camera angles, dual cameras, motion shots, cutaways, and spacing of time kept the film intriguing and suspenseful in what was a dull bank setting. It's best to see this film in a wide screen cinema to get a sense of what Lee is trying to accomplish rather than viewing the future DVD. My only compliant was the movie took too long to get to its conclusion.Rating: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Inside Man-The Bank Robbery that Never Was? ***,"The film starts off as another ""Dog Day Afternoon,"" and for those of you who remember, ""Violent Saturday.""Yes, a bank is allegedly robbed and hostages are taken. Something is terribly wrong when the chief inspector, Denzel Washington, provokes the gang leader, Clive Owen to shoot one of the hostages. There is plenty of screaming and yelling by the shaken hostages. A Jewish woman refers to the gang as Mishagunim(crazies) when they tell the victims to undress. We have an assortment of people in the bank of all different ethnicities.Christopher Plummer is the bank's Board Executive who has a terrible dark secret hidden in one of the vaults. He sends in executive Jodie Foster to pay off the gang. They leave and the hostages are thrown to the ground and are forced on a bus by the police.We have a racist cop who would rather live to be an old aged bigot as compared to a young dead liberal and a Sikh bank employee who is harassed by the police when he is freed and a hint of the bank's collaboration with the Nazis during World War 11.The movie begins to falter once the hostages were released without incident and it is shown that the gang used fake guns, bullets and took no money whatsoever.

"OK, but I've seen better.","Just yesterday I watched ""Inside Man"" at the cinemas, coming out feeling entertained and somewhat disappointed. Your typical cop- robbery and hostage situation is portrayed well, but the way the film ends lets me down. You have Denzel Washington as a NYPD detective called out after mastermind bank robber Clive Owen and his team hit one of New York's biggest and richest banks, within the first minutes of the film after taking the bank employees hostage it was nice to see those sexy and cute female bank tellers strip down in underclothes getting to see those sexy colored bras and panties they wear! After the hostages are finally free the ending upsets me as sure Clive Owen is sent to prison, but Det. Denzel collects the money as it turns out to be an inside scheme started by a hostage negotiator played by Jodie Foster and bank president Christopher Plummer. A sad ending for me because I'm tired of all the crooked plots and schemes designed in our movies, because they happen more and more in our world, making everyone rich not only just the bad guys, but also the good guys as we see of Denzel Washington's character in the end.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
perfect heist movie,"Denzel Washington keeps getting better and better. And Spike Lee ain't bad either. Jodie Foster had a good spot in the movie , but could have been longer, more lines written for her. Clive Owen stole the show as the bad guy robber. Willem Dafoe was pretty good in there too . It was nice to see Christopher Plummer too. i really enjoyed the plot twists. the only thing that i didn't like and this was the only thing was about the flasback interviews with the hostages during the middle of the movie, other than that it was pretty much the perfect movie,, yes there are some un answered questions to the untrained eye, that i didn't pick up on till the last minute, there was slick references to t he movie Dog Day Afternoon, which i still have to buy.

Spike Really Missed the Boat Here...,"INSIDE MAN is a convoluted and confusing crime drama that offers way too many questions and not enough answers. I've always considered Spike Lee a hit and miss director and this one was a big miss for me. This confusing and emotionally manipulative drama follows what appears to be a bank robbery that turns into a hostage situation except that the hostages don't seem to be the #1 priority of anyone outside this bank. Denzel Washington, in his fourth outing with director Lee, delivers one of his most unconvincing performances as Detective Keith Frazier, a badly dressed hostage negotiator who seems more worried about some pending charges from IAB regarding a prior case than he is about these hostages. Christopher Plummer plays the President of the Board of Directors of the bank whose only concern seems to be a safe deposit box inside the bank that he doesn't want anyone to know about and he dispatches Jodie Foster to get it out of the bank before the robbers find it. There's just way too much that's left unexplained here...its never really made clear who Jodie Foster's character works for and she also seems to have her own agenda which has nothing to do with the hostages. Basically, what Lee has given us here is a hostage drama where no one seems to care about the hostages. Washington comes off as forced but Clive Owen, who plays the mastermind behind the robbery, comes off as the most likable character in the film. The film also suffers due to overblown direction, a convoluted screenplay, one of the worst musical scores I have ever heard, and an ending that leaves a bad taste in the mouth. A big disappointment from Lee and Washington,who have both done better work.",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Fantastic!  Denzel & Spike @ Their Best,"INSIDE MAN is a complete joy. It has tension, a good script and fine acting. I was afraid I was in for another one of Denzel's macho cop outings (the African-American equal to the ever boring Harrison Ford), but was happily surprised to find him in top form, bursting with energy and life. On top of his excellent performance this is also Spike Lee at his best since CLOCKERS providing us with a lively and crackling heist flick (or is it?). This is an all around fine film giving Lee the perfect platform for weaving in some relevant and finely pointed political and racial commentary. It's also a great New York City film. Lee must be a big fan of THE TAKING OF PELHAM, ONE, TWO, THREE. It has the same vibe and what a great vibe to have. My only complaint is Jodie Foster's stilted and somewhat over the top performance...there is nothing natural about her in this role. Everyone else, including the large cast of bit actors are fantastic. I obviously highly recommend INSIDE MAN, an upbeat, exciting and always surprising night at the movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

The Opening Credits Music,"In Response to the Review written about the Opening Credits music, as to it being ""annoying,"" I don't think so, and as to it being ""out of place,"" you are absolutely right. The song heard in the opening credits is from one of the most famous Indian movies of all time, and international hit musical, and dramatic political film loved by more fans than critics dare to measure. The song is written and composed by musical director A.R. Rahman, who orchestrates solely ""Bombay Dreams,"" in fact that exact song is in Bombay Dreams. Nonetheless, those who do not understand the song, will not get the beauty, those who do, love it. The words of the song are in Urdu poetry about Love, God, Worship, and Obsession. Words that would put Shakespeare to shame. Now, although I do agree it is out of place, I can see what motivated Spike Lee, and the music director to opt for such an exotic upbeat song. In a country where people tend to lose culture, America, (people lets not deny it, you know what I'm talking about) Hollywood is attempting to expose the audiences with a little foreign, or not so foreign culture. Spike Lee is trying to tell you to turn to the person next to you and ask ""what language is this?"" and ""Where is this song from?"" Those who asked benefited from it, those who did not remain confused or ignorant still to the fact. If people on the west coast or Tri-State had problems understanding the meaning of this song as a symbol, then God help those in the ""good 'ol mid-west.""

another great piece by Spike,"As with all of his other movies, I left the theater feeling as though my soul had been fed. He works at so many levels, and with such grace. Visually stunning, intellectually challenging, morally compelling, and socially rich.In contrast to Summer of Sam and 25th hr, this is a feelgood film, at least in the sense that the good guys are rewarded, and the bad guy (there is really only one here) is headed for the precipice. But that's just a scaffold for a complex crime grafted to a simple moral story. Or at least it would have been simple (the Holocaust was an affront to humanity, and don't forget who took down the world trade center), if Spike Lee was not the premier black filmmaker of his era. What kind of wheaties does this guy eat for breakfast? Can the rest of the country get some?If there is justice in the world, Spike Lee will eventually be known as the best film maker of our generation. Thank goodness he continues to produce in the absence of commercial success and recognition. You go Spike!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Mildly intelligent cat-and-mouse game, but more than a little 'standard'","One day, an unidentified group of robbers lead by Dalton Russel (Clive Owen), dressed in painter's suits, walk into the Manhattan Trust on Wall Street. They set up a bank robbery, taking fifty hostages and have them strip down to their underwear and into similar painter suits. Inside Man zooms in between this hostage situation and the NYPD hostage negotiator Keith Frazer (Denzel Washington), rendering Inside Man into an enjoyable and well-paced heist thriller.It is evident that Inside Man is Spike Lee's more commercial and safe feat, taking us away from the gritty crime-infested streets of racial prejudice in films like Summer of Sam, Do The Right Thing and Jungle Fever, and into the high-profile banks of Wall Street where corruption and deceit escalate as the film progresses. By endowing the film and setting with an air of class and upper-class elitism, he thereby showcases his versatility as a director, because this completely different from any film of his I have ever seen. Lee stills interweaves Inside Man with the odd racial issue, as is his trademark, but it seems he treats this as a mandatory inclusion, touching upon it but not really exploring it or giving it much importance.Inside Man is a very standard crime thriller, not just for Spike Lee, but as a heist-film in general; it has all the necessary plot twists and the intelligence of a cat-and-mouse game, but it is nothing special. Anyone but Clive Owen as the bank robber would have satisfied, because he still sounds like a bored photocopier with one eye on the clock for the pubs opening and is altogether incapable of projecting any charisma or screen-presence in Inside Man. Instead, Denzel Washington is left to facilitate the action by himself and he just about makes it. A completely decent, often entertaining crime thriller... but please, Spike -- stick to what you're really good at in the future.6 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
bob on!,"Well, as is always the case when I wanna see something for quite a while, I anticipated that it may be a bit of a let down. Dint take long into the film to realise that that was a stupid thing to do, Spike Lee wouldn't let me down. This film was an absolute breath of fresh air. Had both the slick and well thought out characteristics of most heist movies but with the personal touches of a vintage Spike Lee film. This gives a fairly recognisable situation within Hollywood films but with real character and feeling. All the characters were interesting and individual; from the leading roles down to the characters there for only one scene. The ability to use say¬Ö Jodi Foster's star persona of the ""tough, independent woman"" kind of role and turn that to the ""tough, independent 'heartless, stone faced' woman"" kind of a role is an example of the touches of character that give this film its energy. Its mild social commentary (The racist NYPD and elements of corruption in the city to give just two examples) was evident enough to make a point but not too much to seem like it was preaching. This is usually the best way to get this kind of message to the people that need to hear it. I would have given my rating between 8 and 9 to be fair but given nothing in between to choose I believed it deserved the benefit of the doubt to be rounded up rather than down. For me, this further strengthens the view that Spike Lee is not only talented enough but diverse enough to be one of the great directors.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Thanks to Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster and Cheistopher Plummer (in particular), you are treated to great acting and suspense in a story that develops into some really good character revelations...but, in a film such as this, the real test is of the Director to deliver, and Mr. Lee has come through with flying colors.

Unrealistic plot and characters with virtue signaling war crimes,"Based on some of the reviews that range from incredible to bottom of the barrel I look at it from another perspective altogether. The problem here is that it is clearly a lame plot but tries hard to be realistic and at the same time virtuous.The guns are obviously fake, far too light-weight and never go off, knocking out bank cameras that are set 30-40 feet high with a hand-held laser and hitting the tiny lens with accuracy, 30-40 hostages acting way too scared of 5 robbers that are clearly a group of misfits and not hardened criminals, one shrill leader in Owens who has to drop the f-bomb 100 times a minute to be believable (not), you can clearly identify the ""thieves"" under police interrogation even though the police were played for dupes the whole time, the laughable fake hostage killing and the worst is that somehow after all of this the robbers get away scot-free and Owens hides inside the bank behind a fake wall for a week undetected(Heat/thermal detecting cameras anyone?).The clear acting winners are Jodi Foster, Plummer and Washington. Foster gets top honors because as the most believable and wanted everyone to hate her which takes all of 30 seconds into her role to achieve.The real problem is the virtue signaling from Hollywood where we are being led to believe that the evil caused by Christopher Plummer during WWII has been assuaged by a holier than thou bank robber, which is claims he's not at the end but that was In fact the intent. In other words, two wrongs make a right, the evil Plummer's deeds are momentarily revealed, a cherished heirloom turned over to the War Crimes division and Owens bands of misfits are now Robin Hood's merry men and one lady.It's a very touchy subject that should not be treated cavalierly by anyone let alone Hollywood and as anyone knows that cares to deal in truth the vast majority of new Euro wealth since 1945 is securely stashed away in secrets lairs and the most in Swiss bank accounts which so far the so-called neutral Switzerland retains a stranglehold on its ill-begotten gains which caused misery for millions. It's no secret that the Nazi's sold Switzerland looted Jewish, Dutch and others gold to pay for its war machine where the vast majority remains today.This is the second of Spike Lee's movies I've seen where he takes a direction that even though the subject is a mine-field he tries to wash away the evil perpetuated by the central character as minimal compared to the wrong-doings of the villain. In this case, Owens terrorizing bank patrons is outweighed by shining briefly a light on a Nazi War Criminals past all the while absconding with a massive diamond haul which he had no right's too either.Another misguided Hollywood virtue signaling movie where the true evil of humanity is a punch line. If they had stayed away from Nazi war crimes and the holocaust they perpetuated on millions just to virtue signal, then it could have been an average movie ignoring the amateurish bank robbers.Basically the ends justifies the means, in this case sorry no way, not even close.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

She has all those moves that make her performances seem so real. With just the narrowing of her eyes and firming up her mouth she tells you she's irritated. No loud exclamations, no bulging eyes. Just simple indications.It was pretty obvious why the robbers dressed the hostage in painter's clothing like theirs. Spike, who is a fairly competent director goofed here. He gave away some of the cleverness of the ending. He should have waited to change the hostages clothing until the hostages were let go. I knew too early what was in store with the hostages.

Weak story,"If this movie had been as meticulously planned as the bank robbery it describes, perhaps it could be a good movie. However the intricate plot it tries to tell us, has some obscure or less well explained aspects beginning by the motives and personality of the robbers. The first part of the movie is convincing in terms of action and situations and the dialogues are lively and witty. But from the moment where the character of the president (and owner) of the stormed bank begins to define itself in terms of his past guilty actions, the story becomes banal and ends in a very uninteresting and meaningless way. The performance of such good players like Denzel Washington and Jodie Foster is about good and that's all.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Great heist movie,This movie had it all. A great cast. A good director. And a good story line. Denzel does it again in this movie.

Clive Owen plays the kind of thief every other movie looks for in their movie. He is calm cool and collective the whole way. He will be if he is not now going to be a house hold name also.

Wait for it on DVD,"I was disappointed with this film because I expected great things from the incredible cast list. This movie is extremely slow-paced and won't keep you on the edge of your seat.A bank robbery turns out to be more than just a bank robbery. It's apparent right from the beginning that there is another motive for the bank to be hit other than money. The director uses too many clues to hint to you that things are not what they seem, eventually making the predictable twist even weaker than expected.Considering that there are 3 Oscar winners in the movie, the performances are not very memorable. Denzel's lines are not strong enough and his character lacks charisma. Jodie Foster steals the show with only a few minutes of screen time and Christopher Plumber is a pleasure to watch but doesn't have enough screen time to make it a strong performance.As for the main actor, Clive Owen, his character is so boring I almost fell asleep...and my friends actually did.This movie is being compared to Dog-day Afternoon, but Owen is no Pacino.Wait for it on DVD.

And the film sparkles sometimes because its creaky machinery, echoing such outdated classics as the explicitly referenced Dog Day Afternoon, is kept going by pros like Denzel Washington, as the head cop, Christopher Plummer as the bank president with an anachronistic secret to hide, Jodie Foster as the suave fixer he hires to hide if for him, and Clive Owen as the preternaturally calm bank robbery mastermind.It's also intriguing that a small group of robbers take over an austere downtown Manhattan bank, terrorize several dozen bystanders who become hostages, and dress them all up to look alike -- and like them. Likewise it tweaks our genre-tired curiosity to see as things drag on and the pizza gets stale that the robber doesn't want the dough, doesn't want the 747; doesn't want to kill hostages (or does he?): what the heck does he want? But at some point even though the pacing is good, we gradually stop caring. And then it's not just the pizza but the suspense that has gone stale.I guess the young first-time screen writer Russell Gewirtz's story appealed to Spike because it hinges on a rich white guy whose wealth all got started with a mega-wrong: cooperating with the Nazis. One trouble: the actor's too young to have done that. Another trouble: he wouldn't have saved the incriminating document. A third: evidence of his wrongdoing would be in a dozen places other than that document. How Clive would know about this, and how Clive would get away with his final escape trick, are not to be asked; this clever story that seems to have entertaining new twists on convention, takes a long time to get to an anticlimactic and bumpy finale. What are Jodie and Denzel doing sitting on that bench at the end, chatting? Not a darn thing, except taking a bow.Even though Lee can't edit himself down to under two hours and this movie splits its seams a bit, he is a pro and he can entertain and provide original socio-political commentary -- this time the more effective for being plot-driven and not crudely in-our-face. But the trouble is the excitement generated by the setup and the interplay between members of the cop hierarchy (including Willem Dafoe and Chiwetel Ejiofor), and the usual phone calls and negotiational gambits and challenges, goes into that slow fizzle-out once it's clear the robber is just stalling. Stalling is stalling. There's only one act of violence that might get your heart rate up again, and if you've been paying attention, it won't.So in the end, if you like Spike Lee's efforts to be mainstream, and you don't care if they quite work, this is an entertaining film. But if you expect real punch or quirkiness from Spike, don't come knocking, not this time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
It was alright.........................,"The performances were solid, supporting to lead the characters were outstanding and showed much depth (even Willhem). The scenes were well crafted and the 'look' of the film was quite intense. However I did have an issue with the story and the back and forth, cute to clever scenario. I wished the film was able to dwell into the direct relationship between Clive Owens' character and Christopher Plummers.' I felt there was more to be said to the reasoning behind his purpose. Maybe a second viewing could perhaps answer this. A sequel would help, but I hope that is not even an option. It's a character driven film and a little bit more. I still would recommend this film, it's a change from all the splash and squash were delivered down our throats by the chimps in tinsel town.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A popcorn and thinking-cap night out...,"Other reviews have done the plot outline, which is not easy without including spoilers. So I'll take that as read ...Despite the few (but important) questions 'Inside Man' leaves unanswered (particularly concerning Christopher Plummer's backstory and motivation in keeping a certain crucial article - and Owen's apparently intimate acquaintance with both!), the political issues it unnecessarily raises (the birth of black gun crime; the vulnerability of ethnic profiling to prejudice etc.), the occasional straining at the leash of credibility, a couple of short dips in the tension, and the seemingly obligatory foul language (but hey, you're not a grown-up if you can't say f**k, are you?), this is a very intelligent, pacey, stylish and tense heist movie; the best I've seen for a long time.I can't understand why the distributors (or whoever) put their product out of reach of a large potential audience by not moderating the language to some extent (and does Jodie Foster have it written into her contract that, in her films, the C word must be used?). But I guess they know what they're doing? I wouldn't take a younger teenager to see it for that reason. But then, they probably wouldn't take me either!Whilst it is plot driven - and that, extremely convoluted and fast-moving, with flash-backs, flash-forwards and cutaway scenes - performances from the 'bums on seats' brigade (Washington, Owen, Foster, Plummer, Dafoe etc.) range from good to excellent. Washington, particularly, is in the zone and it doesn't hinder him that he has such good words to work with. But I was also extremely impressed by the acting of the lesser lights; some of the turns of the hostages were brilliant ...I can't think that, unless you're a super-bright fan of the genre (I score one out of two there!), you would pick up on every detail the first time round: my third viewing revealed stuff I'd previously missed evoking a satisfied 'Ahhh!' (but also raised other inconsistencies I'd not noticed before). That being the case, some of the other reviews don't quite gel with my view of things, particularly that the plan went out of control. It didn't. Owen, the mastermind, certainly had to make the occasional adjustment but in answer to his open question to the hostages 'Is there anyone else here cleverer than me?!' the answer has to be a smug 'No!' - though his ego did nearly get him into trouble once or twice.Except for the above reservations, I rate this as way above average for the genre from the first terrific title and music sequence to the final, er, terrific title and music sequence.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Are you all nuts?,"I really wanted to like this film, but in one simple way it let me down badly - in short, it makes no sense whatsoever.Great production values; great cast; basically a good story, but what on earth happened to the script? There are enormous plot holes everywhere and even what isn't peppered with discontinuity is essentially a load of old cobblers, as we like to say here.This movie has been murdered in the editing suite - by whom, who knows? It all reminds me of the disaster that was The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, although I expect no-one punched the director this time. At least Clive Owen managed to actually do some acting for a change. He's come on a lot since starring in Sin City. Denzel Washington, meanwhile, spends the entire movie looking like he knows it's all gone down the well - there's definitely a hysterical edge to his performance. Isn't Mr Plummer looking good?",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A Nutshell Review: Inside Man,"How do you plan and execute the perfect robbery? Is there even such a thing as perfection in a heist? There are many unknowns, and with hostages, you never know what kind of complications they'll give you. And what more, when the police are all over you in a matter of minutes?Clive Owen plays Dalton Russell, who tells the audience right in the beginning of the usual questions of the whos and the hows. You know, that bit in the trailer where he almost brags about being able to perform the perfect robbery. He and his band of merry men, dressed as painters, storm into a Manhattan bank one day in broad daylight, to rob it. EXcept that this isn't no plain old by-the-book robbery. The methods used are pretty innovative, and we are left to question the motives of what they are doing.Denzel Washington plays hostage negotiator Detective Keith Frazier, brining him back to a good cop role after his award winning stint in Training Day. He's been on the side of hostage taker once in JOhnny Q, and here, he plays a good cop with an edgy suspect past, which despite his plea of innocence, still continues to haunt him. Despite putting on a paunch and looking almost unrecognizable here (is it in to be fat for a role?), Washington too provides a charismatic presence in great counterbalance to Owen's enigmatic screen presence, even though he had to do an almost Hugo-Weaving tribute by acting behind a mask.Completing the heavyweights of casting, is Jodie Foster, Christopher Plummer and Willem Dafoe. Plummer plays Arthur Case, the Chairman of the bank that Russell is holding up, and it seemed that he has a dark secret hidden inside the bank which he doesn't want revealed. Jodie Foster, as Madeline White the mysterious power-broker, gets employed to muscle her way into the situation between felon and cop, while Dafoe lends his muscle as a police captain, in a good person role for a change.Although the film consists of great performers as mentioned, there are limited scenes in which they share the screen together. But it really didn't matter that much, as the material given was riveting enough, and therefore making each moment they share, more treasured. You are left guessing most of the way as the cat and mouse game got underway, and when the finale is revealed, you can't help but share a smile, that it was yes, executed to plan, the way confident Russell wanted it to be.There is a gripe though, that in the local version, swear words were all being silenced over. Which was irritating as there were gaps in conversation which you have to fill in the blanks by reading lips. Even milder swear words like a-hole were censored blank. What gives? There are PG films out there which has characters swearing, you know? And there was one scene which involved a Sikh, that I felt was a tad insensitive. There are times when the movie lapses into prejudices, but maybe that made this movie a little grittier, and in tune with more realistic sentiments and environments. Watch out for that electronic game too, which I thought was a very subtle jab at the kind of games that are selling well in the market, with no regard to the effect on its targeted audience.The highlight of the movie, at least to me, was the opening credits scene, which contained pretty ordinary visuals, mundane even, but when somehow played out to the Hindi Song Chaiyya Chaiyya (which was the opening song in the Shah Rukh Khan movie Dil Se), it added a raw energy factor to Inside Man, with visuals and music blending so perfectly. And it was played to its entirety in the opening, and ending credit sequence - where the characters and the performers name are given a final encore.It's a slick heist thriller, which doesn't conform to the notions of how a heist movie should be. It's the feel good factor at the end of the movie that makes this movie satisfying. This is perhaps the most accessible, and commercial of all Spike Lee Joint films. I'd watch it again, for its engaging politicking story, and for that opening credit sequence.I so love that track, I'm gonna plug it again:Chaiyya Chaiyya Bollywood Joint. Written by A.R.

Masterpiece Bank Robbery Film,"I've seen many many bank robbery films and this is my favorite. The storyline is very clever and it's very hard to guess how everything is going to play out. The setting, characters, and vibe of the movie is stellar, a perfect depiction of NY and the people of NY. The purpose and motivation which is revealed at the end of the story of the robbery is very deep as well. This movie deserves a 10/10 for everything.... The acting, characters, plot, realism, and purpose. It tells a story that has PURPOSE while making it FUN and doesn't get cheesy at any point or too heavy. I can't find one criticism to make about this film.... It really is perfection. ESPECIALLY when it comes to bank robbery films, this movie stands out as Original and unforgettable.

A film that cheats itself of greatness,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The PitsA group of people in plasterers uniforms walk into a busy New York City bank, produce guns and bundle everyone together downstairs. A tense hostage situation has soon developed and Detective Frazier (Denzel Washington) is in charge of keeping everything under control. But the raiders, lead by the devious, condescending Russell Dalton (Clive Owen) aren't making their demands very clear and after a while it seems to all be about something a little more than money.This is sort of an unusual film for Spike Lee to make, and he's done a bit of a Devil's Advocate by using the brilliant Denzel Washington and the rather wooden Clive Owen as co-stars. But Washington, Jodie Foster (although a bit too smug in what is a rather small role), Christopher Plummer and, yes, even would you believe, Owen are all on pretty good form here, delivering great versions of the sort of performances they do best. Plus the film is distinctively Spike Lee all the way, with his trademark use of the camera and delivery style. The film also has a really engrossing story to it, with some great dialogue and soforth.But those are it's good points. The bad news is that it's badly paced, badly edited and as a result the story ends up dragging on a little and becoming a little boring. Some of the plot is badly tied up and doesn't even make sense by the end. As a few other reviewers have said, it's a film that may have tried to be a bit too smart for it's own good and cheated itself of greatness as a result. ***",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Somehow simultaneously glued to my seat and laughing it off,"When a bank is expertly being robbed by four people led by Dalton(Owen, lending tremendous personality, using primarily his voice, his face covered 80% of his screen-time... not to mention that we sympathize with him, in spite of us seeing him terrify hostages), not all seems right. Detective Frazier(Washington, a man of principle, and one whose wits may just match those of the aforementioned law-breaker) is trying to figure out what and deal with the dozens of innocents trapped inside. Meanwhile, White(Foster, utterly nailing the role of an ice queen who gets results) uses considerable pull to try to ensure at least part of the outcome.New York, and its both ethnically diverse and racist people, come alive with the slang, the different types, the many small character moments - the frustration(not fear or empathy!) of their day being put on hold by a nearby negotiation with armed perps. Everyone is credible, and the tight writing leaves little to be desired. Dialog is quotable, poignant, and often hilarious - the comedy in this is disarming, mixed in well with the ever-present threat(did I mention that the hold-up begins right out of the opening credits?).This is tense(especially with cutting away from the scene we desperately want to see the next part of!), with several sudden bursts of violence(a little of it bloody, hardly ever graphic), as it builds and you wonder what's actually going on. It keeps you guessing, and the twists all work out and come together - not only that, but(unlike Minority Report, which I recently rewatched), you can actually keep track of what's going on. Everyone is driven by self-interest, and feel like real people, no one is just a stereotype(positive or negative). The acting is great or better; our trio of leads are incredible.There is a lot of strong language(some sexually suggestive) in this. The DVD comes with trailers for Jarhead, King Kong(the 2005 one) and United 93. I recommend this to any fan of heist thrillers. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Just one leetle problem,"We love these characters so much that we could forget that, even with all their wonderful personal qualities and noble motives, the movie suggests it is fine for the big money to be made in corruption and robbery. If the mayor and the bank president and the discrete Jodi Foster character are all 'compromised' then it should okay for bank robbers to be our heroes. And when they remember to give the good, honest cop a big diamond for his wedding ring, we can almost swoon. For here is this movie's answer to the world's problems: We can have fun and use our intelligence to make movies that even corrupt bank presidents and corrupt mayors will like. Okay, well, we can't base an entire economic system on it. But it had us charmed. And in the end, we don't quite have enough good news lately. It's not my favorite genre, or I'd probably give it an '8.'",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Thank God,"I have been going to the cinema lately, hoping to find a film that satisfies me, even if it is not completely original. Horror films have nearly done the job - Hostel and The Hills have Eyes were good and acceptable.Yet it is Spike Lee's new heist film that has finally satisfied me. Inside Man is a good, old fashioned crime thriller, about deceptively simple heist on a bank. I don't want to ramble on too much, but all I can say is that it gripped me from start to finish. The acting was good on all counts (Washington, Owen and Plummer being very solid).The film did drag a TAD at the end, but I couldn't care less; the film was superbly crafted and well acted. This film is not a 'twist' film. It does not rely on a twist to make you enjoy the film. I enjoyed the atmosphere of the streets, the banter and the tension of the heist.It can never be as good as Dog Day Afternoon, but Inside Man is an enjoyable crime film, albeit nothing special.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
An exciting movie without your typical ending..great acting,"We start all of our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that.What an exciting movie. Denzel is his usual spectacular as are Clive Owen and Jodie Foster. The movie is great from start to finish and the ending is not known until you get there. We love movies that don't have the ending that you can guess half way through the movie. Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Very Original Hostage-Crisis Thriller,"At first sight, ""Inside Man"" does not seem very original: The plot is about a gang of bank robbers led by Dalton Russel (Owen), who use hostages as leverage towards the police. And yet, as the movie progresses we realize that originality is one of the biggest pluses of the film: We soon begin to suspect that the robbers are after something different than the bank's cash, something that the bank's chairman (Plummer) is willing to do anything to protect it, and to this end he plants Madeleine White (Foster), an enigmatic figure, into the scene. This interference displeases Detective Frazier (Washington) who is in charge of solving the case, as he believes that her presence will make his task harder. Eventually, everybody becomes entangled in a complex web with unpredictable consequences...Spike Lee has undeniably succeeded in turning a seemingly typical crime film into something much more intriguing. I subscribe to the view expressed by many that this is by far his best and most mature work to date. He manages to keep the tensions high without resorting to extremities, and he also aptly introduces key plot twists that keep us continuously excited. I also enjoyed his portrayal of characters, in which he carefully avoids to grant ""hero"" status to anyone (not even to Det. Frezier who is arguably the ""good"" guy of the film), but instead exposes each one's flaws in an objective and realistic manner.As far acting is concerned, Clive Owen is the big winner here. His performance as the sly and ruthless gang leader is superb, and I definitely value him much higher after seeing this film. Jodie Foster and Denzel Washington are also very good in their respective roles, while Christofer Plummer and Willem Dafoe (who plays the role of a police captain) have small yet significant appearances in the film.In brief, ""Inside Man"" is a solid and very original work by Spike Lee which well-deserves 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A not so typical Bank Heist,"I saw this movie in Antwerp on ""de nacht van het examen "" yesterday. The story is about a typical bank heist with many familiar clich√©s. A mediocre director wouldn't be able to make such a joint as interesting as Mr. Lee does.I must confess I was slightly disappointed, because we've all seen this bank stuff before. However, this movie doesn't focus on the bank job in the first place. I believe it is merely there because of recognition and certain expectations.The social themes are important ( real issues about all layers of society, which is often very confronting ), like all Spike Lee joints, and besides that the movie is stacked with exciting scenes, twists, delicious humor, great performances ( Denzel Washington & Willem Dafoe did a great job )and a dazzling score from Terence Blanchard ( impressive orchestral music with Eastern accents, comparable with the ""25th hour"" score ).I was also struck by the cinematography, which offers impressive images of New York and is often quite inventive. The close camera-work really creates the feeling that you're part of the situation.I really recommend this movie, because it has enough power to get you satisfied. There were many many moments that I thought : THIS IS GREAT CINEMA! And that's what it is, not a masterpiece, but great cinema with a lot of interesting aspects.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"""Why don't you take a picture, I'll bend down and pick up a pencil if you like""","Clever Clive Owen's got a plan to rob a bank and he duly does but strangely having broken in with his team, steals nothing and takes the customers hostage and waits it out while Detective Denzel Washington tries to fathom the whole thing with the police outside. Meanwhile Jodie Foster gets a call from bank owner Christopher Plummer and is ordered to safeguard the contents of a safe deposit box lieing inside the bank's vault¬Ö This is relatively conventional fare from Spike Lee ¬ñ heavily literate in 70's heist thrillers, indeed Serpico and Dog Day Afternoon get name checked during it's tense, carefully layered running time. This is Lee's easiest Joint to ingest in quite some time but easy shouldn't be confused with simple because Inside Man is intelligent, thoughtfully plotted stuff bolstered by the fine interplay between Owen and Washington. It works because it resembles numerous other similarly themed offerings, the aforementioned Pacino flicks included but subverts such expectations by copying the setup and then refusing to go to any of the usual places. This means you've often jumped ahead thinking you know what's going to transpire only to find Clive Owen's gun in your face¬Ömetaphorically speaking of course. Lee's strength has always been his instinctive understanding of community conflict and social difference ¬ñ here used to great effect, particularly in fleshing out the multi-ethnic characters that populate the bank and notably in the tense relationship between Washington's tec and Foster's high at heel troubleshooter who's as rotten as a week old corpse but a nice contrast with Denzel's honest but rough round the edges rozzer. A fine script by Russell Gewirtz is done justice by a director with two firm hands on the material and a nice steady grip on the tension.

Superb filmmaker,"""Inside Man"" proves that Spike Lee doesn't need controversy to be a superb filmmaker. He takes a tight, twisty, genre screenplay and gives it at once a weight and a lightness that shows him to be a consummate storyteller. He brings an attention to detail, a focus and a knowledge of film convention tinged with both reverence and a sense of humor that he puts into service of the story to great effect. The film reeks of the joy of storytelling.He has the benefit of an A-List cast -- Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Jodie Foster, Willem Dafoe, Christopher Plummer -- that not for a moment seem to be slumming in a ""heist movie"". They exude a love of acting without a trace of self indulgence.The film does lose pace after the release of the hostages, but that is in some ways inescapable, given the plotting (which I don't go into because playing along with the puzzle is one of the joys of the film).The negative criticism of this movie seems to me to miss the point of what the movie is: a game that draws the viewer in, not through violence, although there is some, but through the threat of violence.In earlier films, Lee showed his skill at the display of technique; here he proves equally adept at hiding it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"No Director Wants His Movie to be Seen as a ""Time-Waster""","Eight years ago, I saw the preview of Spike Lee's Inside Man, and I thought that this would be a great use of entertainment dollars. Here it is, all those years later, and I have to confess I didn't mind watching it for free on TV. It's not that Inside Man is a bad movie. It's just so, so much less than meets the eye.Here we have a cast to die for--Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster, Christopher Plummer, and Willem Dafoe. They all do yeoman work, and Ms. Foster has to be one of the most brutally attractive women I've ever seen. Plummer, as usual, oozes spotless evil. Dafoe has a fairly thankless part as a SWAT commander.

I don't know him, and if this is any indication of the man's talent, I don't need to know him.Yet.Inside Man fulfilled its mission--for the viewer to be entertained just enough, challenged just enough, and pleased just enough to forgive how vacant a movie this really is.

"Good movie, but................","The trailers for this movie got me out of the house, which doesn't happen very often, but because of Denzel W. and his last 3 or 4 movies this movie seemed very promising.This movie is interesting, but very slow paced and caused my wife and others in the theater to lose interest half way through the show. I was waiting for some Denzel Washington magic, the great acting was there, but the bad-ass take names was restricted due to the plot of movie and thats what me and I'm sure everyone else was expecting. I wanted/needed a little more info on Denzel's character as well. It somewhat plays a small role with the interactions of Jody Foster's character. To me if a movie is going to show and bring people into the main characters personal life then do it. Otherwise its pointless.This is why I don't go to the movies very often, the trailers lie and so do the critics that say something like ""Jody Foster is at her best"". When her role in this film was an average role, nothing to spectacular to act and average actress could have done just as good. I'm not trying to take anything away from her, she is a good actress, she just had an easy part to act. Still this movie is good, but sell the movie as it is. Don't make it sound like its another ""Man on Fire"" when its not. Don't tell me there's many twists that will have me on the edge of my seat, when actually there is one twist and it was given mid-way though the movie.""Sell the Movie as it is, not what it isn't!""",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Muddled Heist Drama,New York police negotiates with bank robbers who have take hostages. The plot is basically a rehash of other heist films except that this one is rather muddled. It clumsily moves back and forth in time in an attempt to be edgy but winds up being confusing instead. There are enough plot holes to drive a Brink's truck through. There is very little suspense and the ending is quite underwhelming. The plot thread involving Plummer is predictable and nonsensical. Washington does his usual cool guy schtick; his reaction to the hostage situation is much too nonchalant. Owen isn't given much to do. Foster is too arrogant and it's not clear who she is and how she holds so much power.,6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Tarantino - look and learn,"I've never been a Spike Lee fan and have always found him too self-indulgent. But this movie really made me reassess what I have thought about this director.The movie starts of with a surprise musical choice: Panjabi music. I still have no idea why Spike Lee decided on such a selection, but it almost conveys the fact that this movie is unpredictable and works outside the box.Really quite a brilliant piece of work with the script really setting new standards for 'bank job' movies. The suspense is constant. The idea behind the heist sound and slick. The execution is inventive if simple. The actors do a great to excellent job. And that includes everyone from the main actors (Denzel Washington, Clive Owen) and the supporting cast (Jodie Foster, Christopher Plummer, Chiwetel Ojiofor, Willem Dafoe) to the smallest of characters... Immense work from the director and kudos to being able to keep his whole vision intact.An additional bonus to the whole intrigue and primary action are short social and racial commentaries, which are darn brilliant, even if superfluous. Spike Lee however nails it every time, with the Sikh incident being the highlight of the movie. These elements were to an extent reminiscent of Quentin Tarantino's earlier work. But this is a whole new level of what Tarantino has been striving to achieve. Respect to Tarantino for showing the way, but this movie shows just how comparatively lacking he is as a director.This movie almost makes me think that Spike Lee may not only be one of the greatest African-American directors of his generation. He may actually be one of the greatest directors of his generation. Period. (Although I guess a great script helps).Don't have any real squabbles about the movie. Fresh, intriguing, thoughtful and I am really close to giving it a ten.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A nice thriller,"Inside man is definitely worth your time. The acting is great, the cast ist top notch, the tension is held up the entire time, and the resolution maybe not revolutionary but OK.Sadly the resolution is the weak spot of the movie. It is not horrible but it surely doesn't hold up to the movie itself.Besides that I don't have nothing to complain about but much to praise. If you like clever movies about heists and cops and gangsters then give it a try. You won't regret it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Decent action thriller with a powerhouse cast,"""Inside Man"" is a compelling watch with enough mystery sprinkled in that you stay glued to find out exactly what is going on. Denzel Washington's scenes are all enjoyable in the way he banters with almost everyone he comes in contact with. To me, the few scenes with Jodie Foster stand out the most; it's delicious just how she makes her character so smug and confident. Clive Owen makes a good villain but I can't help but think about Willem Defoe in the role instead. ""Inside Man"" would have been a solid movie had the soundtrack been a bit better, along with certain scenes going easy on the music video kick. The ending is satisfying enough yet you still feel shortchanged with a few loose ends.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Good Police Thriller with Excellent Acting.,"It's obvious that Spike Lee is fixated on the subject of race and culture, even in this, his most commercial venture. The film has a great multi-cultural sound track and the movie is populated with the racial and ethnic rainbow that makes up NYC: blacks, Jews, Sikhs, Hispanics, and lots and lots of white folk. Lee even works in an Albanian. Lee is more upfront on how these people all relate to each other in the American melting pot than most other directors. At one point, when interviewing a Sikh who complains of discrimination at airports, Denzel Washinton's character tells him: ""But I'll bet you have no trouble getting a cab."" This real-life stuff is priceless.The story line - the caper - is rather mysterious for a great part of the film, and in the end it's rather a disappointment, if not altogether preposterous. Nevertheless, it's still a film with a lot of atmosphere and with very good acting performances, especially by Denzel Washinton. Here he is is not the pretty-boy Denzel of past years, but a middle-aged, roly-poly NYC detective who's obviously cut a few corners in his life. If this film weren't so colorful it would have made a wonderful film-noir.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Moved fast in the end...,"No, it wasn't very good film. But it wasn't bad either. I'm not fan of Spike Lee but I do enjoy watching him a lot. The guy's a versatile director. This bank heist was more like a best screenplay ride. Performances were very okay-ish. Clive Owen nailed it but I was expecting from Foster and Washington and both of them were meh. Coming towards cinematography, it was a job well done. Music was really intriguing and Bollywood's song as an intro and credit was quite nice. Long story short, despite not being fan of these heist films and shows ( mind Le Casa da Papel ), I liked this one. I liked the idea and its really really good to watch. Hasty at the end but overall its good. Thanks.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Weak Ending,"People dressed as painters take over a bank and hold hostages. The police cannot figure out why it's taking so long for them to rob the bank and try to escape. Detective Frazier (Washington) believes there is more going on than a simple bank robbery.This is a slow movie, but it holds your interest because you and the police and the hostages have no idea what is going on. You are led to believe a bank robbery is taking place because that is what it looks like so you go with it. The police and you savor every clue and the director, Spike Lee, throws you off guard often by letting you think some of his turns have something to do with what is actually going on.The acting by all is first class and the story would have had more of an impact had the ending to this robbery made sense. Maybe I just didn't get it. At least I wasn't stressed out because there was no suspense or tension. My interest was held, but I wasn't on the edge of my chair. After you find out what the real purpose of the ""robbery"" is, you begin to question yourself as to why you sat there for 128 minutes. I sat there for this? For this? No, someone made a mistake. Not for this! See what I mean? That is where I was at the end of this movie.

Inside Spike,"Spike Lee directing a bank robbery movie? ""Inside Man"" is not an obvious Spike Lee movie¬óat least until you realize what he accomplishes in this medium. His ""Inside Man"" has a high power and impeccable cast lead by Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, and Jodie Foster. Russell Gerwirtz's edgy smart retrospective screenplay engages throughout eventually unfolding as a morality play. The movie opens with the charismatic Clive Owen as bank robber Dalton Russell who professes to have pulled off the ""perfect crime"". We soon realize that the story is a retelling of past events, though any resolution of events is made purposefully unclear¬óat least in the beginning.Dalton and crew take hostages in a prominent national bank owned by the elderly Arthur Case (mysteriously played by Christopher Plummer). The robbers force the hostages to wear the same jump suits as the robbers; thus, making them virtually indistinguishable. Upon hearing the news of the hostages and robbery attempt Case (Plummer) instead of immediately calling the Police, calls Madeline White (a strikingly bold and arrogant Jodie Foster) who is some sort of ace power broker. What Madeline actually does for a living is left intentionally vague. However, she does point out to Det. Frazier (Denzel Washington) that ""¬ÖI don't think you can afford me."" Case is concerned about his personal contents in a safety deposit box in his bank, for which he enrolls Madeline's services to protect. In a fascinating character turn Denzel Washington plays Det. Keith Frazier, a detective first grade wannabe assigned to the hostage situation only because his superior is on vacation. The commanding Washington cleverly navigates as this burn out detective grasping for his last chance at reclaiming greatness. Washington expertly balances Frazier's gifted smarts along with his perceived ordinariness. He is an unexpected formidable foil to Foster's cold razor-like Madeline and Clive Owen's dangerous and edgy Dalton.Writer Gerwirtz and Director Lee stylishly unveil their story where all is not what it seems. Washington as Frazier soon realizes that he may be a pawn in the grand power play by Madeline (Foster) and Case (Plummer). The audience also begins to distinguish that Owen's Dalton is not motivated by greed, but instead something more like honor. ""Inside Man"" is glossed with witty and sharp exchanges. Washington and Owen are powerful. Jodie Foster playing the cool calculated Madeline White all but steals the movie. This is particularly noteworthy given that her role is the most amorphous. Her Madeline exists out of her sheer force of will. ""Inside Man"" resolves as a surprise¬óat least for me. We encounter some narrative logical challenges in particular the age of the Case character, and the reason for retaining one of the deposit box incriminating contents. And for the most part we can forgive these logical indiscretions. For the most part. In keeping with Spike Lee vision ""Inside Man"" is really about justice and karma. See ""Inside Man"". It has compelling story telling and superb acting.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Foster has never been sexier, wearing power suits and showing off a pair of gams that never end.The movie is at least twenty minutes too long, has a few too many endings and a couple of loose ends --- WHY is Owen in that bank?

Inside Joke,"I was really excited to see this movie. The cast was top shelf and I truly enjoy Spike when he's not trying to force a cultural message down my throat.Movies tend to be predictable. In many cases you know what's going to happen, the story unfolds as you figure out how. In this case all you know is people are in a bank and a robbery appears to be in progress.As the story unfolds, you wonder why are they there, how will they escape and what are they after. It's this fans opinion that those questions are never truly addressed. To me that made this film and ""Inside Joke"". Somebody out there must have got it, but for my date and I, we left unsatisfied.Denzel was funny, but could have been funnier with a better scripted character. Jodi Foster looked a career best as a character that made little to no sense and Christopher Plumber had what is most likely the most believable character in the movie.Clive Owen is a season actor who is gaining fame domestically, but I can't say that I was overly impressed with his character.I wouldn't recommend this film. The premise is hot and the potential is high, but ultimately is a disappointment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The Heist of the Century,"I have always had a soft spot for a good heist movie. So as soon as I saw the trailer for Inside Man, I was immediately hooked. Inside Man is an amazing film, and this was accomplished by the extraordinary opening scene, the unique way the story is told, as well as the great acting.The plot is very thrilling and is sure to keep you hooked. Inside Man is a heist movie, which follows Dalton Russell and his crew as they attempt to rob a New York bank with several hostages. However the movie also follows the perspective of the hostage negotiator and man in charge, Detective Keith Frazier. The movie begins with Dalton Russell, narrating to the audience how he recently planned and put into motion the perfect bank robbery. After the introduction ends the movie quickly gets the plot rolling by jumping straight into the moment Dalton Russell and his crew takes over the bank. It's a constant game of cat and mouse as Detective Frazier tries to catch the bank robbers. Which may not be as easy as he first intended as Dalton Russell makes sure to make it difficult.The opening scene of Inside Man is quite brief, however is sure to have the audience hooked within minutes. As Inside Man begins, Dalton Russell begins speaking directly to the audience. Briefly introducing the key elements of the plot being the who, what, where, and when, leaving only the how and why unanswered. Throughout this scene although introducing the plot, the mystery created by his speech gets the audience's brains to begin naturally asking questions and more importantly wanting answers.This is merely what sparks the audience's interest, and one of the major factors which continues to make this film great is the unique method it uses to tell the story. Rather than simply telling the story straight through with an established back story early on and possibly a flashback here or there, Inside Man does something somewhat different. Inside Man continuously transitions between two separate times. Half the time Inside Man following Dalton Russell as he robs the bank and Detective Frazier as he attempt to rescue the hostages. The other half of the time is spent further down the road as Detective Frazier and his partner attempt to put the events of the bank robbery together as they question all those held hostage.The acting in Inside Man is also quite phenomenal. The main character, Dalton Russell, is played by Clive Owen. Clive Owen nailed every single part of his role in this movie, from when portrays the intelligent Dalton who is very precise and calm, to the parts where Dalton gets a bit short tempered and snappy. Denzel Washington, who played the role of Detective Frazier, does an impeccable job of portraying his role as well. He really captures the role of being the detective who is very strong willed and passionate about his job; Always going above and beyond the expectations to get to the truth. As far as big name actors go, Inside Man also contains Jodie Foster as the strong willed Madeleine White, as well as Willem Dafoe as the police captain, Darius.These big names however should not completely over shadow the supporting actors, as they are just as important. Their flawless job of capturing the people who live their everyday lives in New York City, is what truly brings the setting to life and pulls you into being right there in New York City.Overall Inside Man is an exceptional movie and is definitely worth watching. If you're one who enjoys a great heist movie, Inside Man will surely make its way into your collection.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Underrated Heist-Hostage Movie That Puts Most Other Heist Movies To Shame -- Keeps You Guessing all the Way,"Late in the film, Jodie Foster as Ms. White says an interesting line: ""When there's blood on the streets, go buy property."" At first the line just seems like an innocent little anecdote, meant as a kind of joke. But then I realized it may sum up the premise of the film. Unlike many of her other roles, Foster plays the equivalent of Mr Wolfe from ""Pulp Fiction"", hired by the upper-crust to ""clean up"" their little public relations problems. (At one point she claims her next job is to help Bin Lauden's nephew.) Although Foster is essentially a supporting character, I bring her up because her non-typical casting is a lot of what this movie is about or isn't about. It's about everything being upside down.At first glance, this is a movie about a bank robbery and hostage crisis, right? Or is it? The brilliant screenplay by Russell Gewirtz coupled with the outstanding direction of Spike Lee create constant miss-direction--about things not being as they seem. A lot of what seems very straight-forward are in fact illusions. But there are hints throughout the movie regarding the motives and the goals of the robbers. But even if you can't put it all together before all is revealed at the end, the final denouement is a stunning twist that makes most other heist movies seem more like mere cops and robbers B-movies. This is a highly compelling and very different take on the genre.The film begins with a brief monologue by an unknown person who says he ""chooses his words carefully"" and never repeats himself. He speaks from a confined area that is not exactly a prison. The movie then takes off with a compelling heist at a bank in lower Manhattan. Denzel Washington plays Detective Keith Frazer who thinks he's in the middle of what seems a straight-forward bank-hostage situation. The siege is perpetrated by people claiming to be high-powered and highly-intelligent criminals, asking for buses and planes in exchange for the lives of the hostages. Their guns are AK47's. Frazer, Captain Darius (Willem Dafoe) and their team set up a stake-out on the periphery of the bank and begin negotiations with the head-honcho. But even from the start, the demands seem strange.In a bit of a slight-of-hand, about one third through, the movie engages in what can only be described as ""flash-forwards"" (as opposed to flash-backs). We see Frazer and his partner Bill Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor) questioning former hostages as if among them were the criminals who created the situation. But with every interview, we begin to understand the authorities don't know who perpetrated the heist. And we also start to lose the sense of the ""bad guys"" and the ""good guys"". When each flash-forward ends, we return to the ""present moment"" of the hostage crisis. In an interesting little trick, we never see the interviews in the present moment but only as flash-forwards.An absolutely mesmerizing film from start to finish with a twist at the end that might cause you to put into question all ""bad guy vs good guy"" films. The acting is first-rate with quite an interesting cast: Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster, Clive Owen and Christoper Plummer. All the characters are on different sides with completely different interests and agenda. One of the enjoyable aspects is to try and figure out the motives of each of the characters which may help in solving the ""riddle"". The ending is more reminiscent of an Agatha Christie book than a James Patterson novel. This movie appears to have been a little overlooked by audiences during its initial release, which is a shame as it is one of the highest-quality movies of its genre.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"Spike, a Sharp Cast and Crafty Script Bring Dimension to Tense Hostage Drama","It's good to see filmmaker Spike Lee come back to form with this highly entertaining popcorn movie that transcends the tense hostage crisis portrayed with a clever plot of psychological gamesmanship and duplicity. At first, the film feels like it's going to be a new millennium update of Sidney Lumet's 1975 classic, ""Dog Day Afternoon"", complete with Terence Blanchard's jazzy, 1970's-sounding score. Lee, however, spices the story with his own sensibilities around urban survival and post-9/11 racial tensions, and the movie benefits greatly from the perspective of a director not known for such predictable genre pictures. While it runs a bit long at 125 minutes, there is so much zigzag to the proceedings that the length is forgivable.Impressively written by first-time screenwriter Russell Gewirtz, the plot meticulously unfolds on a precise, need-to-know basis as it focuses on the mano-a-mano game between coolly confident criminal Dalton Russell and cynical NYPD detective Keith Frazier after Russell and his crew hold up a Lower Manhattan bank and keep fifty hostages at gunpoint. This is no standard good-versus-evil melodrama, as Gewirtz and Lee give both characters a lot of intriguing texture which make them fascinating adversaries in an unlikely search for a common bond. Audaciously, Lee chooses not to spotlight so much on the suspense elements of the tense situation at hand since the movie includes flash-forward interviews with freed hostages. Rather, the film is far more involved with the characters' motivations and what they are willing to do to move toward resolution.An additional wrinkle is the bank chairman Arthur Case, who is worried about securing the confidential contents of his safe-deposit box once the robbery is underway. At this point, he hires Madeline White, a coolly calculating, designer-outfitted power broker willing to negotiate with Russell to get the box. How all four characters dance around each other is the primary pleasure to be derived from the movie, as one keeps guessing what each will do to get to his or her objective. Moreover, Lee's trademark touches are everywhere from the unexpected sparks of comedy - some piercing in their political incorrectness but no less funny - to the artificial backward zooms that make characters look like they are on conveyor belts to the idiosyncratic behavior of the hostages.Casting is just about ideal here. It's no surprise that longtime Lee muse Denzel Washington is terrific as Frazier, showing the character's flaws, ambition and moxie with maximum fluency. Clive Owen has the most cryptic role as Russell, but he manages to exude supreme confidence and a conflicted conscience with minimal fuss. Leave it to Lee to capitalize on Jodie Foster's inherently chilly intellect and subvert it to make the patronizing White a curiously ambiguous and utterly fascinating figure. There is nice supporting work by Christopher Plummer expertly shifting between benign and treacherous as Case, Willem Dafoe surprisingly non-villainous as the head of the SWAT Team, and especially British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor a completely convincing New Yorker as Frazier's enthusiastic partner. There is a nice twist at the end, but Gewirtz's script makes it satisfying within the context of the entire plot. This is a deft, character-driven thriller most welcome during the typical late winter/early spring movie-going doldrums.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

It is wicked to see William Dafoe and i wish he had more scenes and Jodie Foster appears as well. There is a very well pitched humour about the film which had the audience laughing frequently but without producing an oceans 11/Guy Ritchie sort of predictability that is so common in these kind of films at the moment. Also present is the ubiquitous Lee political comments which some people find annoying but i think he makes valid points and it is another element that elevates this film above the usual releases. All in all this is definitely one of the best films i have seen for many months and i would recommend it highly (i don't normally bother writing comments).

The perfect robbery (film),"How I missed this film on its release is beyond me but I did so I caught it on its second run, a little late but glad I did, as it's a great film. Spike lee's modern day bank heist in Manhattan is superb from start to finish. The script is sharp with some killer lines and the direction is ultra smooth. Denzel Washington plays a police hostage negotiator who tussles throughout with Clive Owens criminal mastermind. I've never really rated Clive's acting before but here he shines as the bad guy and along with Denzel's performance they keep the film flowing along at a thrilling pace. Basically its cat and mouse with a twist or two but it is so stylish and clever and funny that it just has such a fresh feeling about it. With an orchestral soundtrack that should seem out of place but strangely fits, the music only goes to enhance the overall plot. There is an array of supporting cast members from bank staff to customers who all have their own little scenes that are cut in at intervals during the film to reveal a little more of the plot each time. Then the film wraps up with one final twist in its tale. Sharp, intelligent and different Spike has pulled off the perfect bank robbery film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
I want  a sequel with the same folks...,"Inside Man won me over. I actually want to go back, and I very seldom want to see a movie twice. The story is its strength and it's complicated. Keith Frazier, or Denzel's character, has depth and charm. The master mind of the heist has his own stoic charm and is certainly enigmatic. Some of the police officers seemed like they walked from their beat to the set.What I found most interesting were not the plot or characterizations but the style of the directing and the interactions between characters. Several scenes are burned in my brain. One with a hand print, one with a shadow, and another with a syringe-- You'll see. There are at least three scenes between officers that would make great 1.5 minute movies. These could be played as conversation starters for discussions about race in America today. It's not just the exchange of words. It's the looks they gave. I love that kind of realistic silent conversation that takes place in a millisecond of pause.I don't understand why Spike Lee used what I took to be Bollywood music (and perhaps some Arab sounding music?) through the opening and closing credits. I guess it saved money... I have to admit it made me jive in seat abit. Catchy tunes, even if they weren't in English. But did that have some kind of tie-in to the story? Was that a statement about where money is going? Or who is righting wrongs?The theater I saw Inside Man in was 95% filled, with about 25% African American patrons. I came out of the theater listening to a comment that it was one of the best films seen in months and months. Spike Lee has a hit! I found it very entertaining.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A Compelling Premise That Fails to Deliver on Its Promise,"Inside Man is a heist thriller with an intriguing concept and a strong ensemble cast led by Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, and Jodie Foster. Directed by Spike Lee, the film skillfully builds a mystery around a meticulously planned bank robbery and the enigmatic contents of a box hidden within the vault. However, while the film succeeds in maintaining initial intrigue, it ultimately falls short of being a truly memorable experience.The standout performances elevate the film significantly. Washington's smooth and confident detective is a delight to watch, and Owen's portrayal of the clever and composed thief keeps the tension alive. Jodie Foster adds an additional layer of intrigue with her morally ambiguous character. The direction and pacing are solid, and the cinematography and music contribute to the film's overall atmosphere.However, the film's major flaw lies in its lack of payoff. The mystery of the box-what's in it and why it matters-is introduced as a key plot point, yet the resolution feels underwhelming. While we learn its significance in a historical context, there's no emotional or suspenseful climax to justify its prominence in the story. The absence of a satisfying reveal or explanation leaves the viewer questioning its importance.Moreover, the lack of a strong sense of closure diminishes the film's replay value. Once the initial mystery is unraveled, there's little incentive to revisit the film. The tension fizzles out by the end, and the story never fully capitalizes on the suspense it initially builds.In conclusion, ""Inside Man"" is a film that thrives on its premise and performances but falters in delivering a lasting impression. It's an enjoyable one-time watch, but the lack of a compelling resolution prevents it from rising above a 6.5/10. While it has its moments of brilliance, the film ultimately leaves the audience wanting more.Would I recommend it? Sure, for the performances and the initial intrigue. But don't expect to find yourself revisiting this one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Best Movie of 2006,"Any Spike Lee/Denzel Washington collaboration is cause for celebration, as they always seem to bring out the best in each other. This time isn't any different, but what really surprises is how well the rest of the cast carries the film, making Washington almost seem like a bit player. Owen commands the screen as the master criminal matching wits with Washington's hostage negotiator. Foster is suave and smooth in a way Washington normally is, and Plummer has a quiet reserve and vulnerability that has made some of Washingtion's characters truly memorable.It's great to see Spike removed from the political expectations that so many of his films convey, though this film does tackle a few race issues amongst the intrigue. In fact, Spike's casting prowess allows the film to be populated by a number of ethnic minorities, giving the film some added realism and tension, two elements this film has in spades.The premise is simple, as Owen and friends enter a bank and proceed to take customers and staff hostage while the police waits outside. Owing a lot to Dog Day Afternoon (which is a good thing--that's one of my all time favourite films), this bank robbery gone bad is gripping and will leave you guessing right until the last frame. Spike crams each frame with intensity and the actors are more than game.In typical Spike fashion, there are several layers to the film and the characters' motives are equally complex. He knows when to stylize the action and when to leave it raw. He pays just as much attention to dialogue heavy exchanges as he does to gunplay and smoke bombs. The result is a formulaic hostage film played out to perfection, with just enough twist and turns that everything feels fresh, exciting, and intense.Inside Man is perhaps one of the best rentals of the year, and I eagerly await Spike and Denzel's next collaboration. This one is definitely for film fans and casual movie goers alike. I don't want to say too much in fear of giving anything away, but you won't be able to tear yourself away from this film.Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Wonderful,It was great movie. I watched it second time. But somehow i get this feeling that something was missing. So my rating is 8/10.,8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Great movie, but secondary characters could have been better","I liked this movie, particularly on a second viewing.Only one small grumble/ Many of the secondary characters were not given much time to develop, so there were some great actors like Chiwitel Ejiofor who had to play rather stock characters, in his case the central casting side-kick cop.But apart from that it was a great, smart movie.It is nice to see that some people still want to stretch the audience, not just rely on slapstick or special effects,or gross-out. One last thought - some people thought there was a lot of swearing, but I hardly noticed, so can't have been all that bad.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Well plotted hostage thriller,"Denzel Washington plays Frazier, an opportunistic New York detective trying to redeem his career who lucks into being the man in charge of defusing a possible hostage situation at a downtown bank.Only things aren't what they seem. For one thing, the robbers are very deliberate, taking their time to accomplish their task. For another, powerbroker/go-to gal Madeleine White (Jodie Foster) appears on the scene at the behest of the bank's president (Christopher Plummer) to retrieve something that the bank president keeps in a safe-deposit box. Sounds like someone has something to hide, doesn't it? Well, Frazier smells a rat, but nothing he tries seems to work. He at first is content to sit back and let the chief bad guy (Clive Owen) indicate his terms and conditions, maybe get him to release a hostage or two. But there are too many unknown variables at play. No one knows how many gunmen there are, or how many hostages. Or, most importantly, how the baddies plan to escape, since they're surrounded by hundreds of law-enforcement people, vehicles, and guns.So this turns into a cat-and-mouse game between Washington and Owen. From the audience's perspective, we can see that the robbers have dressed the captives just as they themselves are (i.e., gray pullover, sunglasses, and white mask), and sometimes they release one - just enough to keep Washington's Frazier off balance. He can't figure out what they're up to, but he also can't storm the bank and take them by force without risking the lives of an unknown number of hostages.The story is told in overlapping time frames: the standoff and the aftermath. This is instructive to the audience, as we can ascertain how the standoff ends. Ah, but the strength of the plot lies in the details. As the title bluntly puts it, someone - or some people - who were in the bank when it was commandeered were in on the heist. But who? We see Frazier and his partner interview the hostages, trying to ferret out the robbers, and from what they say we can piece together the rest of the story.Spike Lee does a wonderful job of maintaining the tension of the situation without really forwarding the plot, but there are some small problems with the script. Washington's character seems a little too glib; he's not quite snarky, just kind of flippant at times, and it doesn't feel right with the scene. I'm not sure if this is a product of Washington's acting or Lee's directing, but the two usually mesh much more seamlessly.All in all, The Inside Man is is a taut whodunnit, reminiscent of movies like Dog Day Afternoon and The Taking of Pelham One Two Three, films that highlighted the congealed multinational humanity that is New York, that should keep you guessing until the end, although it does raise a few questions more than it answers.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Spike's Gonna Give it to you,"One thing I'll say about Spike Lee films, they never are what you expect them to be. I've seen probably 100 movies about robbing banks. None quite like this. Which is a good thing.When you combine Spike with Denzel, you know you're going to get magic. Even if the film is not good, you're going to have some stellar performances.Inside Man is no exception. Denzel is simply Denzel...but it's the supporting cast that really let this one ride. Clive Owen has a screen presence that can only be matched by greats like Jody Foster and Washington. Every movie I've seen Owen in he's taken over the screen --even in that stinker of a movie 'Closer.But I digress. This is arguably one of Spike Lee best films, even with all of the social commentary that's thrown in sporadically in scenes here and there.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Wonderful,"Inside Man is a nice film about a bank robbery, hostage taking, and a little bit more. The movie starts out in an interesting manner; the star tells you the - who, what, where, when - of the film up to a certain point and then lets you see how it all happens. Clive Owen and Denzel Washington do a very fine job in this film along with Jody Foster and Christopher Plummer and Willem Dafoe. There are many twists, turns, and hints that giveaway some of the ending. A great combination of multiple story lines and flash-forwards that give the film a slightly different format. Owen and his crew enter Plummer's bank and take everyone hostage. While Washington and Dafoe try to catch the robbers and save the hostages, Plummer (a man with a secret) hires Foster to convince Owen to leave that secret alone. Foster calls in some favors from some powerful people that hinders Washington from catching up with what's going on. Can Washington catch up, save the hostages, and grab the robbers? A top notch film destined to be a classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
one of Spike Lee's best,"Being only an intermediate fan of Spike Lee's films (I think I've seen about 70% of his work) I can honestly say that this is one of Spike Lee's best films to date. Probably the only movie he's made that's better is Malcolm X.Inside Man is exciting and interesting in all the right times and places, and the best part is that it keeps you guessing until the very end. Truly, Inside Man is one of the most unpredictable films I've ever seen and what's more, nothing is what it seems. For example, at the beginning of the movie you're almost positive the villain is gonna be Clive Owen, but as it turns out, he's more of an anti-hero. It ends up being that the real villain of the movie is the owner of the bank getting held up! The characters are believable and true, and as always Denzel Washington is superb.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Enjoyable, but it drags in places","Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) is a master criminal who has spent an awful lot of time preparing and planning the ultimate heist - his target is a large bank in Manhattan. Attempting to thwart his plans are disgraced hostage negotiator Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) and broker Madeleine White (Jodie Foster) who is acting on behalf of the bank's CEO Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer).Spike Lee's Inside Man is certainly intense and energetic in its early stages; when the gang enter the bank and take their hostages the film has a high level of tension and intensity - the elaborate lengths that they go to in order to stay one step ahead of the police are also quite clever.Where the film falters slightly are on occasions where the focus shifts away from the bank and on to other characters; whilst I could understand why Jodie Foster was in the film and what her character was all about I didn't feel that she made any real contribution and that she had any real impact on the film itself. It also has to be said that her character and story arc were undoubtedly the weakest aspect of the film and did drag it down slightly. Whilst I liked the idea of the film cutting between the heist and interviewing several people 'after the event' it all feels a bit disappointing when in the end it all serves very little purpose.Still going back to the positives, the film does have one or two twists along the way (although for every good twist there is another which is more obvious) and the acting is pretty good by everyone. It is pacey and energetic enough to make it worth watching, but it lacks the tight and fluid direction of a film like Dog Day Afternoon which is a film that it clearly aspires to be like (it is even referenced directly at one point in the film). The actual story behind the 'heist' is actually the strongest part of the film (it is certainly better than many of the gimmicky twists) and isn't as generic or obvious as one may initially assume. I also found it hard to really hate a film where boobs actually form part of the story (both Kim Director and Samantha Ivers assets were the focus of the film on a couple of occasions which was perfectly fine with me).Inside Man is a decent film and is worth watching, but it lacks tight direction and unfortunately it does drag in places. If you enjoyed this film then I would recommend that you watch Dog Day Afternoon which is a similar but much better film than this one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A semi action movie worth watching,"I am thoroughly impressed with the outstanding job done by the NYPD consultant in this movie! The attention to detail and accuracy is truly commendable, elevating the overall authenticity of the film, Denzel Washington portrayed himself as en excellent police negotiator, as well, Willum Defore, ESU Captain, as all other actors portraying uniform officers Well done!Brings me back when I wore the NYPD uniform, I guess one can say back in the day, when Moes wore shorts..
I have to comment, the opening and ending Indian music drove me to watch the music video, that song stuck in my head all night.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Inside Man -- Well Weaved Heist Movie,"The movie is packed with solid performances from Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Jodie Foster and Chiwetel Ojiofor.Movie have some really exciting twists and turns. The grip of movie is so good that you won't even leave the theater for the intermission or bathroom break.I am a big fan of Mr. Denzel Washington and have seen some of his brilliant performances and this one in the movie ""Inside Man"" is also one of them. He always manages to impress me.I haven't seen much of Jodie Foster but can surely say that this movie doesn't absorb her talent or can say not properly used. But i liked that she did good job in that not so appropriate length of character.Clive Owen either is one of the star performer of this movie about whom i haven't heard much but with this performance i can tell that i'm not forgetting him for long time.I have seen some of the movie related to this ""bank robbery"" genre but this is one of the unique one and can be casted as also the best of them.Telling about the plot without disclosing it is not possible.So i would like you people to watch this movie and i can assure you that this is one movie you'll surely like.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
a successful heist,"Along with Denzel Washington and Clive Owen's outstanding performances, director Spike Lee has really delivered a heist movie that works....on a great level.Although it begins like any other bank robbery, viewers are shown that this isn't your ordinary day-to-day heist and that the *bad guys* have actually planned out what they are doing...and planned it out well.Having Denzel as the hostage negotiator, and Clive Owen as the main robber, viewers are shown a match of wits that keep us thinking. They are both similar, both tall and handsome, and both know exactly what they want and how to get it. The pair work well as protagonist/antagonist and it is impossible to tell which one will dominate.With an unusual but impressive soundtrack, Inside Man is a great movie that all will enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
