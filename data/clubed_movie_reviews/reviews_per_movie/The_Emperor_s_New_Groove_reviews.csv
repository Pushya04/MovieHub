I'm 23 and I still LOVE this movie,"Disney has done it again with a FUNNY FUNNY FUNNY FUNNY (how many funnies is that?  4?...not enough) FUNNY FUNNY FUNNY (you get the point) movie.Picture this.  2 friends and I walk into a local movie rental shop and start arguing over the NEW releases.  Horror movie?  No.  Slasher flick?  No. Drama?  No.  Etc, Etc, Etc.  Finally, as if it were fate, we all walk into the Disney/Children section of the shop.  One suggest ""Emperors New Grove"". The rest automatically agree... and we weren't disapointed.David Spade is brilliant as the voice of the Emperor in this movie.  His humour was definatly evident throughout the entirity.  Speaking of the humour... it was funny.  Ha, ha.  Ain't I a kidder?  Seriously though, I have to say that this is the funniest Disney movie that I've ever seen... and it's definaly because of the cast... who were brilliant in all their roles.  There was a lot of adult humour in this one though.  Nothing gross or sexually oriented or anything, but just grown up... intelligent... making it a fabulous watch.If you haven't seen this, then I suggest you do... and soon.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Maybe not a Disney classic, but a hilarious original worth your time.","The Emperor's New Groove is enjoyable with plenty of laughs provided mainly by our villainess, Yzma, and her dim-witted sidekick, Kronk.The comedy is also the movie's biggest strength along with its vocal cast. David Spade as emperor Kuzco gives this self-absorbed and bratty character a weird likability which is admirable. John Goodman as the peasant Pacha is pretty much your average John Goodman role, but he does that well. They are also good for some great laughs when they are together.As I mentioned at first, Yzma and Kronk are simply hilarious. I slapped my thigh several times watching them. Eartha Kid and Patrick Warburton both do excellent voice-work.Aside from the comedic proficiency I find it pretty average. The animation looks a lot like a Saturday afternoon show, but still better than the later 2D abomination of ""Home On The Range"" (2004).The setting of the story is pretty original, but the story itself is kind of recycled, not bad, just an average ""egotistical-asshole- learns-how-to-be-nice-to-others"" story.But what the hell. It works! The Emperor's New Groove is definitely worth your time.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Puts many newcomers to shame,"It is truly amazing what stemmed from The Emperor's New Groove, which at one point seemed like a doomed project. Originally titled Emperor in the Sun, the film was going to focus on a selfish emperor who optimistically switched positions with a peasant look-a-like who would later become the target of an evil witch's plan. She was going to summon a dark spirit to block out the sun to prevent her from aging, almost like a retelling of Dorian Gray.The film developed an untold amount of stress for everyone involved. Producer Randy Fullmer was aggravated that production was moving at a snail's pace and was consistently rushing director, at that time, Roger Allers to speed along, offering him no extensions. The project had to be done as fast as possible in order to meet the strict summer 2000 deadline. Out of options, Disney hired the director Mark Dindal, who had worked on the musical Cats Don't Dance, one of the few animated films not to boast the Disney label, and both him and Allers developed very different story lines for the same film, one focusing on comedy (Dindal's) and one heavy drama and morals (Allers).At the end of the day, Fullmer denied Allers an extension and he abandoned the project, leaving all the weight on Dindal's shoulders. The project did not make the summer 2000 deadline, but went on to be released during the wintertime of that same year, something one must applaud considering the treacherous state it was in for so long. What Dindal managed to do to a project that looked to be a lost cause from there on out is truly astonishing, proving that even the dustiest pieces of work can be polished off to look good. The Emperor's New Groove is a delightful film, occupying a concise runtime, unstoppable action scenes, and fierce and interesting characters rarely striking a wrong note.The story focuses on Emperor Kuzco (voiced by David Spade), the selfish, manipulating emperor of the Inca Empire. After firing his adviser, Yzma (Kitt), her and her dim-witted assistant Kronk (Patrick Warburton, who also voices Joe Swanson from Family Guy) concoct a scheme to kill the Emperor by making him drink a poisonous potion. During a staged dinner, the potion gets switched and Kuzco is turned into an unattractive llama. Hidden inside the bag of Pacha (Goodman), one of the Emperor's peasants, the two realize they must work together, despite being on opposite ends of the food chain, to try and get Kuzco his position back.It is pretty clear that the ""he was a selfish man"" story has been well-played out. It was just six years after this that the Pixar film Cars modified the formula and injected it with a nostalgic rush to put it to use. The story is moved along by its refusal to provide a heavy-handed moral or become bogged down with complications from such a simplistic story. This is a genial exercise in smooth, involving animated filmmaking, moved along by its action and its instantly lovable characters.Also, there is something nice about returning to the wholesomeness of an animated picture from the early 2000's. Ever since the creation of full length CGI pictures, which all started with Toy Story in 1995, it appears hand drawn animation and claymation have been unfortunately pushed to the side, while the easier way is taken out. I love CGI animated features, especially the ones from Pixar, but really, how much of the candy-coated colors and the overly cheery atmosphere can you healthily stomach? The early 2000's animation is one of the few successful hybrids, perfectly blending the simplicity of animation with the digitized color enhanced textures.This is also an elegant reminder to parents and teens who enjoy nostalgia that 3D is a tainted gimmick. Here, the characters pretty much gleefully jump off the screen as if boundaries have been shredded, and they are so lively even without the dim colors or the extra dimension. This is the kind of animated feature Disney should be striving for, and they would be much closer to their competition at Pixar.The Emperor's New Groove is animated slapstick, and functions inside such a rare formula so well. It is elegantly voice acted, expertly animated, and it is nothing but surprising that a picture that one seemed doomed has now gone on to be such a remarkable picture.Voiced by: David Spade, John Goodman, Eartha Kitt, and Patrick Warburton.

High Praise For This  'Kids' Film,"You've often heard the sales pitch, ""adults will love it, too!"" almost always referring to a kids' movie and in particularly, an animated movie for children. Well, in this case I agree. Even as a middle-aged adult, I enjoyed this.The dialog is adult-friendly but at the same time not coarse or crude with no sexual innuendos, no profanity or even a hint of it. Yet, it's hip with some very clever lines.The story is interesting and offers a few unique twists. David Spade does a fabulous job narrating, has a very pleasing voice, one that's fun to hear. I actually do think adults would like this more than children.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hurrah!  Perfection.,"Hard to see why it wasn't a wildly popular mega-hit - I have two theories, one charitable, one not.  The charitable theory is that people were put off by the title.  MY heart certainly sank when I heard it.  I mean, just say it out loud - ""The Emperor's New Groove"" - now how could a good movie POSSIBLY have a title like that?Yet now, I rather like the title.  It fits the story; it doesn't care if it's fashionable or not; it's just so pleasingly RIGHT - but in an almost indescribable way you'll have to watch the film to find out.  Maybe it WAS a marketing mistake.  Who cares?  I never took seriously the charge that Disney's artistic decisions were made by its marketing department, anyway.That was the charitable explanation for why it made considerably less, inflation adjusted, than every other one of Disney's animated features from ""Beauty and the Beast"" on, and failed to even get nominated for a ""Best Picture"" Oscar in a year in which they had difficulty coming up with half-plausible candidates.  The uncharitable explanation is probably closer to the truth.  People are idiots.  This is a classic - but it's also animated - by pencil on paper rather than finger on keyboard - so who will ever notice?Doubt me?  You won't once you've seen it.  Everyone to speak of who did reports that it's very, very funny, and they're right - and trust me, nothing is ever THIS funny unless it's clever and witty as well.  It goes without saying that their character animation is unmatched in its brilliance and ... I've already used the words ""humour"" and ""wit""?  Well, I'll use them again.  In addition there's a charming dottiness that a merely hip film could never quite capture.  Art direction is perfectly judged and consistent throughout, with a pleasing absence of because-we-can computer effects.Here's just ONE example of what I'm talking about.  One side of the emperor's palace consists of this HUGE golden face, and we find out in a funny scene (but they're all funny) that all excess water is drained out through the nostrils.  But that's not all we see.  We see characters crawling out of the nostrils, we see someone dangling like a big booger on a rope out of one of the nostrils - one snot gag after another - yet no explicit camerawork ever draws our attention to them.  Not only do the characters deliver their lines perfectly deadpan, the camera delivers its images perfectly deadpan.  It's just perfect.Two more things I should mention.  Unlike Disney's other recent features, it never, not even for a second, feels as though the story has been unduly compressed - and at 78 minutes it's a trifle shorter than most.Also, despite the constant hilarity, it's rather touching.No movie I've seen in the past six months has filled me with such joy. Well, perhaps there have been a few others, but they were all made long ago.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fun with llamas!,"Although my affection for other Disney movies of the 1990s has decidedly waned, my love for ""The Emperor's New Groove"" is still as strong as ever. In fact, I'm now beginning to think it's a work of genius. It's clever, unpretentious, fast-paced, and- like ""Lilo and Stitch""- you don't feel that the vision of the film was muddled up by the suits. The characters are not constantly breaking into song, and there is a welcome lack of cloying sentiment. No cutesy talking teacups here! The lightning- fast comic timing, sharp writing and constant loony non sequiturs (i.e. ""For the last time, we did not order a giant trampoline!"") improves upon each viewing, and the voice work is uniformly excellent, from David Spade's hilariously bratty emperor to Patrick Warburton's dim boy-toy Kronk to Eartha Kitt's Yzma (an over-the-top screeching Erte-style villainess with an alleged ""secret lab"" who is also ""scary beyond all reason""). You get the impression that everyone involved had lots of fun making this. The art direction, with its whirling cartoon Inca motifs, is simultaneously goofy and gorgeous- and it shows what marvels can be done with nary a pixel in sight. I even love all the local L.A. humor, with even Bob's Big Boy making an appearance. Although I was initially dismayed when I heard that the project, originally entitled, ""The Kingdom of the the Sun,"" was to be changed to ""The Emperor's New Groove,"" I think in the end the changes were a good thing. Did the world really need yet another bombastic Disney musical?No, I didn't think so either.",,Anonymous,Animation
Great Disney Movie,"Disney movies are known for being highly recommended movies for all ages and the original movies(such as Cinderella,The Little Mermaid, Snow White,Aladdin,etc)are enjoyable classics.Unfortunately,Disney has been running out of ideas and fail to recreate the old Disney magic. This movie however,proved me wrong.This movie is about a self-centered,spoiled and seemingly heartless young Emperor named Kuzco.With the snap of his fingers,he can get anything he wants even if it's a summer home.He only worries about himself and his needs and no one's whatsoever.That all might change with Pacha,a generous,thoughtful,and intelligent everyday peasant.He seems like your average peasant with a middle-class family and some farm animals of his own.He and Kuzco have nothing in common and have a bad start(Kuzco demands that Kuzcotopia,his new summerhouse to be built on top of the hill where Pacha and his family live)but they overcome that throughout the story.Yzma,Kuzco's cunning,stubborn and pessimistic adviser was recently fired and she wants revenge.In return,she decides to poison him with a potion with the help of Kronk,her lovable,dim-witted and humorous right-hand man. Unfortunately,he transforms Kuzco into a llama instead and when he tries to get rid of him,Kronk accidentally drops him on Pacha's cart which Pacha brings all the way to his village without knowing that the emperor is actually in a bag on his cart.With Kuzco far from the palace,leaving Yzma to rule the empire and leaving Kuzco and Pacha to triumph over the obstacles to travel to the palace,what will become of the story?Watch it and view good quality comedy with a pinch of drama and be amazed.I believe this movie is a Disney classic.The magic of Disney returned in this enjoyable story.The characters are well-developed and all three dimensional.Kuzco begins as the spoiled brat who can literally get anything that he wants and throughout the story,he learns the value of friendship and generosity.At first when he turns into a llama,the teenage audience want Kuzco to stay as a llama because of his bad attitude yet later in the story,they're rooting for him to transform back into a human.Pacha may not be the best character but there's no one who can hate him.Pacha already has compassion and generosity from his family life and may seem speechless in some scenes but most of that changes when he meets Kuzco.Pacha is also the one who gets him and Kuzco out of sticky situations in the jungle.In most Disney movies,the villains are serious and seemingly boring but this movie changed that Disney law.Yzma was hilarious as an old and ugly woman who is almost as spoiled as Kuzco.She has clever lines and has impatience which is what makes her humorous.However,Kronk deserves most of the credit for the humor.Kronk is the most lovable character in the whole movie.He delivered his humor with enthusiasm.The squirrel scene cracked me up.I'll rate this movie a 7.9/10 for memorable quotes and a deep friendship built.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

One of the grooviest films of all time.,"It seems a paradox that one film can be loved by both children and adults, and blend todays culture in an ancient setting, making an all-around phenomenal film.The movie begins at the halfway point of the story, then rewinds to the begging to show how we got there. The emperor has complete power over his people, but he doesn't use it to wage wars like your average emperor. Oh no, he just eats and dances and parties in the utmost PG way. Except his horrifyingly ugly chief advisor wants the power for herself, so she transforms him into a lama and throws him out of the palace in the most hilarious and contemporary way. He can only find his way back with the help of a peasant who he previously kicked off his land. So they strike a deal and attempt to find their way back to the palace.The themes are on the surface, a selfish king needs to learn his lesson in caring for his people. We all serve (even kids) in a leadership capacity in some way, so watching something with morals like this is always a good reminder in selflessness and caring for those we are responsible for. Not only that, but we can see what happens when you don't learn from the selfishness and greed of the chief villain. So this movie provides both an example to follow and a stern warning, but it's not in your face. Not necessarily the most complex themes, but it's complex enough for its intended audience. It's good to have a movie that can teach kids good lessons about life, even if they don't realize it. There aren't enough films today that do that.The animation isn't revolutionary, but checks off everything we need plus more. With a fine plot and good characters, I'd say the filmmakers accomplished everything they needed to and then some.At the end of the day, this is simply one of the best kids movies ever, and you can't go wrong with it. Hey, even if your an adult and want to watch something fun, this could be for you.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Boom, baby!","""The Emperor's New Groove"" is a rare hilarious Disney movie.It's very different from any other Disney movie so this movie might also be very watchable to you Disney haters out there. The movie pace is incredibly high and the music by John Debney and Sting are a real surprise. The movie really is a non-stop hilarious comedy with some unique humor. Also the style, both visual and story-wise is different from any other previous Disney movie, which in this case is a positive thing.The characters are great. Kuzco and Pacha are a perfect team. Yzma is a remarkable villain and her sidekick Kronk is hilarious. Yep, Laughs are guaranteed in this very hip and hilarious movie!The story really is of no importance and most of it never makes sense but that's also why this movie is both unique and hilarious to watch over and over again.Highly recommendable to everyone!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hits Even After 24 years,"""The Emperor's New Groove"" is the heartwarming tale of a spoiled brat turned farm animal who learns to... not suck. Disney truly outdid themselves by giving us a protagonist so insufferable, you actively root for the villain-for at least the first half. Kuzco, a narcissistic emperor with the personality of a TikTok influencer, gets turned into a llama (because why not?) by Yzma, a villain who looks like Cruella de Vil's caffeine-deprived sister.The plot? Kuzco wants to build a water park on some dude's house. The stakes have never been higher. Said dude, Pacha, is the only sane character in this circus and spends the movie dragging Kuzco's furry behind across mountains, cliffs, and what I can only assume is Disney's leftover Tarzan landscapes.And Kronk. Let's talk about Kronk. The true star of the film. A henchman who's less ""evil sidekick"" and more ""gluten-free pancake enthusiast,"" Kronk is the golden retriever we don't deserve. His shoulder angel and devil scenes are so philosophical, they make Socrates look like a hack.The animation? Slick. The humor? A bizarre mix of fourth-wall breaks, slapstick, and Seinfeld-level pettiness. The message? If someone turns you into a llama, maybe it's a sign you need a personality makeover.Disney really said, ""Let's forget our usual 'true love saves the day' formula and throw in a chaotic road trip comedy where the biggest love story is between a llama and his sanity."" 10/10 would groove again.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Underrated Disney Gem,"Being in development hell for a very long time and released to not much hype ""The Emperor's New Groove"" is often, unjustifiably, overlooked as one of the Disney masterpieces.

Cliche-ridden Nonsense,"This movie was a big disappointment.  From the choice of David Spade as the starring voice to the cliche-ridden, anachronistic dialogue, I found myself groaning at every turn and was grateful when the final credits rolled. Some have likened the film to Aladdin, but I saw very little resemblance between these two movies.I have to say up front that I can't stand David Spade, so the movie got off to a very bad start for me.  His narration in a whiny voice didn't interest me in his character, and I found myself wishing that Yzma and Kronk would succeed in finishing him off--not the kind of ending one wants for a children's movie.  Spade's failure was reinforced by the worst screenplay I've seen in a very long time.  Tired cliches stood in for good dialogue, modern-day speech and expressions simply have no place in a movie set during the Inca heyday in South America, and the sight gags were nothing more than recycled vaudeville routines that work well in live-action, but fall flat here.While I was glad that Disney got away from the usual song-and-dance routine as well as the stupid comic-relief characters that are stock features of its animated films, I wouldn't recommend the direction that 'New Groove' took. The storyline had great promise, and the voices of John Goodman and Eartha Kitt worked very well, but David Spade and the writing team combined to ruin a good idea.  Disney wanted to make a slap-stick comedy, but I fear all the studio really succeeded in doing was making itself a laughing-stock.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""Bring it on.""","""The Emperor's New Groove"" is stylistically a break from Disney tradition - it's closer in tone to the Genie in ""Aladdin"" or some of their TV shows than most of their movies, making a refreshing change. In fact, you could be forgiven for thinking that this isn't a Disney movie at all... the only talking animal has a good excuse for yapping in the voice of David Spade, the only romantic relationship is that between Pacha and his wife (and even there it's more the sign of a happily married couple), and apart from the Emperor's Theme Song Guy (""He's the hippest cat in creation..."") - and Sting over the end credits, but we'll forgive that - no one bursts into song. Plus the emphasis is more on Warner Bros-type energetic humour than usual. No wonder it was a disappointment at the box office; not your traditional Disney movie.Then again, ""The Rescuers Down Under"" was an underrated pleasure as well.The story isn't particularly different - you've got the ruler who has to change externally before he can change internally (""Beauty and the Beast""), Kronk, the good-hearted sidekick of the villain (Yzma) who can't bring himself to kill the hero (""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs""), and so on - but as is often the case it's not so much what the plot is as how it's handled. Although the movie suffers from ""Is-that...?"" syndrome - it's too hard not to see Finch from ""Just Shoot Me!"" every time Kuzco speaks (strangely enough, even though Pacha's wife has the voice of Wendie Malick from the same show, I never pictured Nina Van Horn... which isn't the case with ""Fillmore!"", where Miss Malick voices Principal Folsom. Go figure) - the movie's speed, energy and high humour rate make it easy to forgive, with Kuzco and the bad guy's sidekick as standouts. The movie's also a bit more self-reverential than other Disney movies, notably in our hero's narration (plus at one point Yzma and Kronk notice they're leaving a blue trail behind them, which turns out to be the trail they leave on the map to the palace illustrating the race between them and our heroes).The surprising thing is that it even works with character - though the Emperor is enough of a self-absorbed hedonist (to a prospective wife: ""Let me guess - you've got a really great personality"") to turn off Paris and Nicky Hilton, he and Pacha have a believable relationship throughout the movie, so that by the end we're rooting for him to get turned back into a human. Too bad Marc Shaiman's score was thrown out (he'd have been a natural, as opposed to John Debney), but no sense whining over what might have been. An adventure, a comedy and a drama all in one, ""The Emperor's New Groove"" has everything that was notably absent from DreamWorks' own South American-set cartoon ""The Road to El Dorado"" (charm, interest, no Elton John overdose and so on) and is the funniest movie from the House of Mouse since ""Aladdin."" It's easier to forgive them for giving the world ""Dinosaur"" in 2000 as well.Why DOES she have that lever, anyway?",,Anonymous,Animation

One of Disney's best animated films,"I think the film wasn't initially well received because it is so different from much of the Disney canon. It's much closer to the classic Looney Toons in its zaniness than say Sleepy Beauty.

Films like this live and die on their performances; the four principals of Goodman, Spade, Kitt, Warburton are all *perfect* in this film. Every time I watch it it is just as engaging and delightful as the first time I saw it. The film ended up being the first in a series of animated films-the Shrek films, others come to mind-making meta-jokes or commentary on their forms to produce much more comedic offerings. Returning to it after 20 years or so just makes it stand out as the trend setter it ended up being.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Very kid-friendly and pretty good fun, but its a weak entry from Disney","Often there are those kids movies you love and when you rewatch when you're a grown up you discover a lot more about why you loved them. Shrek has its Lord Faarquad, Toy Story 2 has Buzz's wings ejecting, and The Emperor's New Groove has...well, a llama voiced by David Spade strutting around being David Spade. Maybe this isn't one of those.But it would be unfair to judge a kid's film on its appeal to adults. The story is still fun, there are a smattering of jokes (definitely ones that will appeal to kids - talking animals, slapstick and goofy Kronk being goofy), and is full of colour. The film's highlights include the voice acting of Patrick Warburton and John Goodman (both voice-acting staples) and also Eartha Kitt's villain, who is memorable even though she could easily pass for Cruella de Ville. Towards the end of the film, there are a couple of fourth wall breaks that make for a good chuckle as well.As for flaws, well Kuzco undergoes a remarkable transformation in a remarkably short and convenient amount of time. David Spade is neurotic and I cannot bear him, even just as a voice actor I know he's there. And ultimately, Emperor's New Groove can't help but feel like a shallow Disney effort.Its still an easy, fun watch, but its a more inferior Disney film and you'll get far more enjoyment from watching the superior aforementioned Shrek and Toy Story 2.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Criminally Underrated,"""The Emperor's New Groove"" is, simply, one of the most underrated movies in cinema history. It is certainly the most underrated Disney 'toon, and I find that impossible to understand; it's bright, colourful, witty and, most importantly, completely hilarious!The story is a kind of demented fairytale: spoilt young emperor is accidentally turned into a llama by his bitter advisor and teams up with a local peasant to undo this crime and return him to his human form. What that summary completely fails to convey is the sheer brilliance of this tale; not only is it blessed with simple but great animation, a cracking pace, a witty script, original jokes and quirky asides, but the whole thing seems to be a lot greater than the sum of its parts. The characters are wonderfully drawn and are some of the most memorable in Disney history; Kronk is hilariously naive and simple (Patrick Warburton does a brilliant voice-job here), David Spade is on top form as the cruelly sarcastic Kuzco (Disney's most despicable ""hero"") and Eartha Kitt's Yzma is a gloriously over-the-top riot - a Disney villainess who tries so hard to be bad and scary that she ends up simply looking a fool who can't even impress a squirrel (if you watch the movie, you'll know what I mean).While the awful - and, crucially, unfunny - ""Shrek"" wowed the masses and got labelled one of the best comedies ever made, ""The Emperor's New Groove"", despite glowing reviews, only has something of a cult following, and anyone who didn't ignore it upon its release is glad of it.

One of Disney's trinity of cult animated movies,"Along with 1985's The Black Cauldron and 2001's Atlantis: The Lost Empire, The Emperor's New Groove (2000) is the closest thing Disney has ever come to making a cult movie.

Their Aladdin was as well; however, unlike Aladdin, TENG is wackier, faster, and features a hero who is borderline unlikable in his vanity and selfishness. The style is angular and bold, a bit of a departure from the usually rounded Disney style, one that would be brought to its greatest extreme in Disney's Atlantis.In tone, the movie feels a lot like a classic Looney Tunes short, but it does not forget the heart so common to Disney's work. It gets much better every time I rewatch it; it is one of those rare movies where I know the dialogue by heart. I think about anyone in my generation can quote it. If you haven't seen it, then you're in for a good time!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A hilarious buddy film that just HAPPENS to be animated.,"Now that ""Emperor's New Groove"" has arrived, I will forgive Disney for that bad film (IMO) that was ""102 Dalmatians.""I thought this is one of Disney's best films in YEARS.For starters, the voice cast is EXCELLENT.  David Spade is sensational as Kuzco, the emperor-turned-llama.  (Kuzco is a rarity for a Disney film:  a main character that we're actually NOT supposed to like!)  John Goodman is in Dan Conner mode (his character from TV's ""Roseanne"") as Pacha, the kind-hearted llama herder.  Eartha Kitt is great as Yzma, and Patrick Warbuton steals the show as Kronk, Yzma's dimwitted henchman. Spade and Goodman are wonderful together, and they make a great buddy team. And that's essentially what the film is:  a buddy film.It should be said that there is no groundbreaking animation or Broadway showtunes in this film.  And you know what?  GREAT!!!  Contrary to what some may believe, there is no Golden Rule that says all movies shalt have those two things in order to be entertaining.  The animation is clean, vibrant and colorful; the opening song performed by Tom Jones is very catchy; and the story WORKS.  But that is just what I was expecting from a movie directed by Mark Dindal, who also directed the wonderful, overlooked ""Cats Don't Dance."" Dindal injects ""Groove"" with the same energy level he did ""Cats,"" and the results pop off the screen.If you want groundbreaking animation and Broadway tunes, go put ""Aladdin"" back in the VCR.  But if you want an entertaining film that will make adults laugh as much as--if not more than--kids, then shake your ""Groove"" thing over to see the ""Emperor.""",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The funniest Disney film ever,"The Emperor's New Groove has two qualities that separate it from the rest of the Disney animated pack: humor that can actually be enjoyed by someone over the age of five and only one musical number and it's at the beginning. That's the appeal of this film. Most animated Disney films both in the past and now have just too much singing in them. Not everyone loves singing animals so Emperor's is a good movie for those of you who didn't like the squealing songs of Aladdin of The Lion King.The cast is what really makes this movie funny. Great writing coupled with the talents of David Spade, Eartha Kitt, John Goodman, and Patrick Warburton make this movie a laugh riot. Some of the jokes are geared towards adults so mom and dad won't be bored while watching this flick.Bottom Line: This is a good movie and one of the funniest ever made by Disney. It's good for all ages.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Funny and highly original film.,"I really enjoyed this movie. After some almost disastrous attempts at direct to video sequels, I was hugely surprised to see for once a wonderfully funny and highly original film. The animation is spot on, with beautiful backgrounds and well-drawn characters that are also likable. They are also very funny, especially Kronk, who looked similar to Gaston in Beauty and the Beast. The music by John Debney and Sting was hip and memorable. Usually in direct to video sequels(which of course this is not) the songs are just awful, and sound like they were improvised in five minutes. A good example is Cinderella 2. The songs here have funny lyrics, are well sung and sound as though the composers took some extreme lengths to make it perfect. The voice talents are exceptional. David Spade's acting ability is somewhat limited but for this type of character, a selfish emperor called Kuzco who is turned into a llama by his adviser, it works wonderfully. John Goodman was very earnest as Pacha, and the villainess Yzma, who I would pick over the really bland Morgana from the Little Mermaid sequel any day, was played to perfection by Eartha Kitt. The script is funny and touching, and while sometimes it isn't as laugh-out-loud funny as some animated films, it has a huge impact on the well told story. I have no real criticism for this movie, other than it is probably too short. Anyway 9/10. Bethany Cox.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of Disney's WORST movies in years,"This confusing mish-mash of a movie is a real chore to sit through.  The characters are dull, the plot is pointless, the animation is sub-par, and the music feels like it was slashed to ribbons.You thought Tarzan was dull?  You ain't seen nothing yet.The basic story involves a selfish amoral emperor (David Spade) who is turned into a llama.  The movie is a bit of a quest picture as the emperor tries to get himself restored to human form.At the end of the picture we have a selfish amoral emperor who has, as far as I can tell, done *nothing* worth being restored.  There's certainly no moral lesson here, or at least not a good one.There are a few good jokes, though most of these are well over the average child's head.  The voice talents are good, as both Spade and Goodman deliver their dialog in a believable, in character manner.  Eartha Kitt is quite good as the evil Sorceress Yzma.  In fact, the voice talent, I think, is better than most Disney films of recent memory (with the exception of the Toy Story movies, quite possibly the best).  This is not enough to save a movie that I found to be predictable, silly, overblown, and, in the end, empty.  Somewhat like eating a snow cone.  There's some flavor, but no body.My 3 year old son likes it, but then again he's three.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Hilarious, Irreverent, Memorable","One of my all-time favorite animated comedy films. So unexpectedly funny, especially with the anachronisms and fourth wall breaks. It's such a hilarious and absurd storyline. Does not take itself seriously at all, which makes it that much more memorable and endearing. It's so irreverent, which really makes it stand out from other children's animated comedies. So much so that it really holds up nearly 25 years later and is quite enjoyable to watch as an adult. Every character has something about them that just makes them unforgettable. You'd expect the protagonist to be cool, calm, and collected, but he's just as petty as the villain. Their attempts to foil each other make for great entertainment!",,Anonymous,Animation
short and fun,Kuzco (David Spade) is an arrogant dictatorial Inca emperor. Pacha (John Goodman) is told that his village is being destroyed in favor for the emperor's new summer home. Yzma (Eartha Kitt) wants to rule instead. She and her dim-witted boy toy Kronk (Patrick Warburton) tries to poison Kuzco but it transforms him into a llama.David Spade's sarcastic comedy comes through. It's a pretty simple Disney cartoon. Its short length and thin story makes this more like an episode than a feature. It's fun but not that substantive. The main character learns to be good and the villain gets her comeuppance. The animation is not always that cinematic but the heights do give a bit of vertigo. This is a short and fun ride.,7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Extremely Refreshing.  Pure easygoing delight.,"Great job, Disney!At last, a movie that's not sickeningly cloying, has no irritating song stuff, disgustingly clicheed story, or CG everyone's fed up with. What it does have is a great humour that will keep you bursting with laughter till the end.  Pure easygoing delight.While adults will enjoy absurdist and sarcastic humour, probably the kind you'll find in Alice in Wonderland, kids will have their own share, and it's a generous one. As with Alice, surprisingly these two parts overlap a great deal.  That's what made Alice a huge hit back a century in England and that's what makes The Groove such a great family movie today.8/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Kingdom of the Fun,"Apparently there was this thing that happened in 1994 called ""The Disney Renaissance"". The Lion King brought back ""Classic Disney"" or some such nonsense. The implication is that mega-hits like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin were not good enough. Nope, it was the Lion King which restored dignity to the studio. Dignity which they then squandered on garbage like Hunchback of Notre Dame and Hercules. On top of this Dreamworks Animation was gearing up to be a serious competitor while Pixar was hogging all of the glory.Such was the success of the Lion King that director Roger Allers was given permission to indulge himself in a vanity piece called Kingdom of the Sun. It was to be an epic, mystical spin on the Prince and the Pauper set in Peru during the time of the Incas as well as a romantic comedy musical with serious weight to the mythology.Honestly, this sounds like the kind of movie that I would have hated. The Disney suits felt the same way, though were even less kind when it came to communicating that opinion to the creative team. The development and production of Kingdom of the Sun dragged on for years with innumerable clashes, arguments, and differences between Allers and Disney. None of the moneymen liked where the film was going. A half-finished version was screened and rejected. Production was shut down. Allers was off the project and Mark Dindal was brought in to replace him. In the process Dinal completely overhauled the movie and changed it into something quite different. And thus Kingdom of the Sun gave birth to The Emperor's New Groove. A serious, mystical epic became an archaic slapstick comedy more in the vein of Looney Tunes than Lion King. And it's all the better for it.Throughout this shambolic development only three people remained constant: David Spade as the spoiled emperor Kuzco, Eartha Kitt as the conniving Yzma, and Sting, who would provide the soundtrack. The latter ended up only doing a single song ""My Funny Friend and Me"", but it did get an Academy Award nomination (which it lost to Bob Dylan). Sting's wife Trudi Styler was even commissioned to make a documentary on the production of Kingdom of the Sun and covered every torturous twist during those terrible times. What was supposed to be just an ordinary ""making-of"" became a rather notorious stand-alone documentary called ""The Sweatbox"" which was such a damning and difficult portrait of the House of Mouse that they have never allowed it to be officially released (and barely acknowledge its existence).Make no mistake, The Emperor's New Groove did not have an easy journey from concept to screen. Far, far from it.When the trailer screened in early 2001 in the UK I was immediately dismissive. I had become tired and jaded of the setting and tone. With The Prince of Egypt and The Road to El Dorado in the recent past I was not in the mood for more of the same. I was loudly vocal about how awful the trailer looked. But then something very odd happened...Kuzco turned into a Llama and it became surreal and hyper. I remember squinting and saying ""Uh...what IS this?"" I'd much rather take a chance on an odd curiosity than a self-proclaimed epic.The final story sees Emperor Kuzco betrayed by his assistant Yzma who plots to kill him in revenge for being fired. Her lunkhead servant Kronk (perfectly voiced by Patrick Warburton) mixes up the poison potion and instead transforms Kuzco into a Llama. Discarded into the nearby jungle Kuzco teams up with good-natured peasant Pacha, whom he earlier condemned to homelessness. They make a deal - help Kuzco turn back to human and Pacha can keep his community. Together they fight their way through the wilderness back to the palace with Yzma and Kronk close behind, determined to finish the job.TENG moves so fast it will make your head spin. This movie barely takes a breath, so much so that I don't think that the opening and closing titles even lasted a single second. It's just one wonderfully overblown set-piece followed by another. You'll be grinning so hard your face will be in agony. I can't call it anything other than my absolute favorite Disney animation (Big Hero 6 coming in at a close second) but I'm sort of annoyed that it gets such a bad reputation and that its often forgotten.Released in the US in late 2000 the movie received little fanfare and had a horrible dated marketing campaign that was stuck in the mid- 90s. While most Disney movies are shoved in our face and pretty much demand that we go see them this one seems to end up merely being discovered by growing cult of fans. I guess that makes a unique and controversial movie all the more special.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Boom, Baby!","I know that this isn't considered one of the Disney ""Classics,"" but Emperor's New Groove has some of the sharpest humor of any animated film that I know. It's a fun watch for both children and adults.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney's cult classic animated movie,"""The Emperor's New Groove"" was the beginning of the end of an era for Disney's hand-drawn animated features and still, in many ways, represents the tug of war between the studio's past and present.Once titled ""Kingdom of the Sun"" and planned as yet another in a long line of Disney musicals (featuring music by Sting and a story along the lines of ""The Prince and Pauper"") the film underwent a calamitous production. After test audiences responded poorly, it lost a co-director and was eventually overhauled and salvaged into ""New Groove."" The movie has all the trappings of a classic Disney fairytale, but only one opening song.The story of selfish young Emperor Kuzco's (David Spade) ego check feels as though it should be a much more dramatic and emotional tale. We only get a brief introduction into how little empathy he has before his spurned adviser, Yzma (Eartha Kitt) and her marble-headed henchman Kronk (Patrick Warburton) accidentally transform him into a llama and send him out into the country. His only source of help is a family man named Pacha (John Goodman), whose village Kuzco said he would bulldoze to make room for his new summer vacation swimming palace.From there the story follows predictable patterns of friendship and betrayal and friendship before a stirring climax that tests to see whether our hero has turned the corner. That's nothing new, but what does feel a bit new is Disney's carefree attitude.Perhaps it was out of necessity to turn around a new and better film out of the one they'd already started, but director Mark Dindal keeps things very stripped-down and to the point, with an emphasis on humor above all else (the title is certainly an indication). The movie feels like the shortest of its ilk. In the late '90s, this was a pretty left-field approach for a Disney animated feature, but also a kind of brilliant one. Instead of wasting time on what were — at the time — stale fairytale tropes, the focus shifts to being silly and audacious. Screenwriter David Reynolds undercooks the whole thing and just loads up on all the fun stuff from '90s Disney movies like the references that go over kids' heads.The finished product comes off as pure fun. Spade is perfect as Kuzco, loading up on catch- phrases and making his character unlikable in a lovable way, while Kitt and Warburton's Yzma and Kronk duo are simply unlike any villainous dynamic seen on screen. They've have a hysterical, almost campy way about them, and they're not menacing or scary at all. They're more like adult Loony Toons characters than anything like the most notable '90s Disney villains. Although the stupid henchman thing had been done countless times, there's a refreshing charm to Kronk.The best way to phrase it — ""The Emperor's New Groove"" is like the cult hit of the hand-drawn animated age. Disney essentially released a send up of a Disney movie and at such a vivacious pace, it completely works. The fairytale qualities of the story evoke classic Disney films, but the wit and physical comedy are on a whole other kitschy level, which kind of hinted at the style of future animated family films. Part of the kind in me wants to be swept away by another music- filled magical animated feature, and for that reason the films that preceded it will always be better, but it does something fun and off-beat in a good way.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Top tier Disney....,I was 18 when this film was originally released and I do remember it came and went with little fan fair. Watching it now genuinely for the first time ever I must say I'm puzzled as too why this wasn't a bigger deal.It's just straight up funny from beginning to end. Like proper belly laugh moments were in abundance for me. The film was littered with brilliant one liners and terrific slapstick comedy. I honestly can't remember another Disney animated feature that I've consistently laughed so much at.The voice cast were all superb also and really helped bring the characters to life and yes that includes David Spade whom not generally a fan of.Overall this is top tier Disney in my opinion and it's one I'll definitely be revisiting several times over.,10.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of Disney's last masterpieces,"I'll admit, upon seeing the trailer of this film back in the day, I thought it looked awful- especially the style of animation. But I judged a book by its cover.This film is hilarious and one of the last greatest animated films that came from Disney (along with the others in this new generation of computer animation, such as Treasure Planet, Brother Bear, etc.). The comedy is what keeps this film alive, and one of the key parts is the lack of sing along type of songs- which actually is a good formula that keeps the movie flowing.The style of the animation- while not the best in the world- actually reflects the comedic attitude of the film at most.",,Anonymous,Animation

Very fast and funny situational comedy,"Originally this movie was supposed to be released under the name of Kingdom of the Sun, director by Mark Dindal and Roger Allers, the latter being a co-director of The Lion King. It was going to be a more traditional Disney adventure musical. Unfortunately the studio and Allers didn't see eye to eye, and eventually the whole idea was scrubbed and the existing material was turned into a buddy comedy.And as far as saving jobs go, they could have done a lot worse. You can definitely see that they had to cut a lot of corners to get the film out on schedule, but the movie has a lot of style, great sense of humour and very likable characters. It's one of the funniest Disney films I've ever seen - if not THE funniest - and stands out from the rest of the canon.The basic premise is that an Incan emperor named Kuzco gets turned into a llama after he fires his royal adviser, Yzma, who happens to be a sorceress of some talent - aren't they all. And now Kuzco has to get back into his palace in order to turn back into a man. The only problem is that the only man who can help him is also the chief of the village he intends to raze to the ground in order to build a summer home for himself. Not a very complicated plot as far as Disney films go, but it's the comedy that brings people back to this film. And that works beautifully. All four of the main characters have very good voice actors and they all have great chemistry together. The film also takes full advantage of its animated nature, giving us some really imaginative scenarios and gags.The only real problem I have is that the plot is very predictable and that the animation, while working very well in terms of comedic value, does look kind of cheap by Disney standards. Plus, while I enjoy the fact that Kuzco starts out very unorthodox for a Disney lead, his eventual character development is about as clichéd as you can get.Still, I do like the film a lot and it's an easy recommendation for anyone that enjoys Disney and for anyone that appreciates light-hearted comedies.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A must see... over and over again!,"I am rather ashamed to say that, like a lot of excellent movies, I missed this one in theaters.  At the time I thought Disney was cheap, childish hogwash, but I now realize otherwise.  With Disney's recent stunning works such as Dinosaur, Atlantis, and yes, The Emperor's New Groove, I have a new outlook.David Spade is the perfect voice for Kuzco.  Like Kuzco, the man is pompous and arrogant.  In most of his movies he plays a role such as this.  Kuzco is no different.  The character has a mind of his own, and throughout most of the movie the viewer will be surprised and entertained by his comical witticisms and his I'm-So-Much-Better-Than-You wisecracks.We meet Kuzco, ""King of the World"", according to the Theme Song Guy, as he is at the peak of his kingly career.  Just how he loses that career, is transmogrified into a llama, and put at the bottom of the social structure, is hilariously magnificent.  The conflict is ever so funny, and the climax builds to hysterical, uncontrollable laughing.The movie also contains several different subplots, such as Kronk and his two little supernatural friends and Pacha and Kuzco.  The audience is thrown from conflict to conflict, each containing their own hilarious twists.Disney has put together yet another superbly animated film, and dubbed it with a name like no other and enlisted a cast so brilliant that it's hard to find any flaws with this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A selfish, arrogant and hillarious Llama","-It's a story of how using your power and authority in bad way will make you a hated person but did the movie tell that?
Our villain Hmm sorry... Our main character ""Kuzco"" is a selfish, greedy and heartless emperor.
The character was written in a funny way, he was a bad person in a way that I'd break my screen to kick his ass for his actions.
In contrast, ""Pacha"" was a good person and for me he was a poor character and his actions weren't reasonable at all, he was written to be the pretty, kind and forgiving example for the kids.-The narration style was pretty awesome, hilarious sometimes and creative for an animated movie (I think it's the first movie that followed that style
And ""Kuzco"" as a narrator was so funny as he mostly narrates the story making himself the victim.-The movie suffered from lazy writing, they used ""Deus ex machina"" technique a lot.. like literally in the last 10 minutes they used it 4 times.-Answering the first question, for me the movie didn't make him a hated person as he wasn't hated from any character except ""Yzma"", ""Pacha"" hated him for a little bit but that wasn't enough he literally saved his ass from death more than once.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

After he fires his administrator, Yzma, she uses her magic to turn him into a llama, rendering him powerless so she could rule the kingdom in his place. He needs the help of llama herder Pacha to regain his throne, who is the one with the village he plans to destroy.This movie is soaked with slapstick comedy and modern-day clichés, from the hip-sounding Kuzco to Pacha's typical Hollywood-acting family, and from David Spade's narration to Kronk's (Yzma's sidekick) big oaf personality. Everywhere you turn, there are gags, modern-day dialog and more humor, which can be distracting in a movie that is supposedly set in ancient times. The plot is simple with few twists and turns, as it mostly concentrates on Pacha trying to help Kuzco get back his throne, with Yzma and Kronk in pursuit. But, I have to say that the film did crack me up a few times, especially during the scenes with the hilarious Yzma. The animation is also very colorful and vibrant.Overall, it's a very silly movie with overblown jokes, limited character development and plot substance.Grade D",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

I would to take a minute to talk about the character of Yzma, she is just an awesome character, very well written, well designed, and extremely well voiced. Could there have been a better actor to voice Kronk?? Patrick Warburton is so perfect to voice Yzma's hopelessly ignorant assistant. David Spade is very fitting for the self obsessed, selfish, spoiled rotten emperor Kuzco. The story is fun, well paced, funny, and heart warming towards the end. This is one movie the whole family will surely adore. It also is a very healthy movie for children to view since it shows the before and after of Kuzco, going from being extremely selfish and materialistic to actually caring for others and becoming a nice, decent human being.

Thoroughly underrated and seriously entertaining,"When listing my top 5 favorite Disney movies, I often get weird looks as I list this newer, and highly underrated film behind classics like Peter Pan, 101 Dalmatians, Lady and the Tramp, and Beauty and the Beast. In my opinion, however, The Emperor's New Groove deserves to be in the running as one of the newer Disney classics. The movie follows Emperor Kuzko, a seemingly selfish young ruler who is turned into a llama by one of his former advisers. Though the idea of a selfish ruler learning his place in the world is not an uncommon theme in movies, especially Disney movies, this film does it in a new way, making it seem fresh and original. Add some fabulous and easily quotable lines, the incomparable Eartha Kitt, an always hilarious Patrick Walburton, and David Spade in one of the few roles where he is actually tolerable, and you have the makings of a Disney classic. It's just a shame that this near perfect film doesn't get the recognition it deserves. So, if you've never seen this wonderful little movie, do so immediately. It will be well worth the hour and half, and I think you'll see why I think this movie deserves so much more than it's gotten. Hopefully, with age, it will be seen for what it is- an absolute masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Good fun, a throwback to Roadrunner and Wylie Coyote type of animated physical comedy.","The most irritating thing about watching ""The Emperor's New Groove"" on CBS is that they showed a 78-minute film in 2 hours, which means for every 8 to 10 minutes of movie, they interrupted with 5 minutes of commercials, so I could not get into the rhythm, or ""the groove"", of this movie.Spoiled, self-centered brat of a King (David Spade) is turned into a Llama as his assistant (Eartha Kitt) tries to kill him. He is accidentally found by a peasant (John Goodman) who helps him get back to his castle, avoiding cliffs, waterfalls, scorpions, bats, leopards, canyons, but they never get even a scratch, just like Roadrunner and Wylie Coyote. During his journey back, he develops a sensitivity he didn't have before, and after he finds the potion to become a man again, he is destined to become a good king, with a ""New Groove"".The scenes are very inventive, the dialog very witty, and I found myself laughing spontaneously often. Spade and Goodman were especially a good comic team. But my favorite character was Kronk, the not-too-smart giant of a bad guy who acted like a little kid every chance he got. Tom Jones, the singer, provides some of the background music.However, this is not really a movie for small children. Several times the characters say they ""want to kill"" and at least once use the word ""hate"" to express an ill feeling.  Small children do not need unnecessary exposure to that.  Overall I rate it ""7"" of 10 for good entertainment fluff.  Maybe a ""6"" would be better. Not as good as recent animated movies like ""Tarzan"", ""A Bug's Life"", ""Prince of Egypt"", and the two ""Toy Story"" films.",,Anonymous,Animation

His sarcastic dry delivery was PERFECT for Kuzco. I only recently found it Chris Farley was supposed to play Pacha and that made me sad because he is an all time favorite of mine. None the less John Goodman filled in quite nicely. His portrayal of a good hearted family man landed perfectly! Izma and Kronks dynamic was also hilarious. Eartha Kitt and Patrick Warburton had chemistry and fed off each other well. This movie can do no wrong. I loved it as a kid and after rewatching it as an adult man I still love it.

Peak 2000's Disney movie,"7.6/10I honestly totally forgot I ever saw this movie before...damn what a movie honestly it was very good and kinda got me hooked up with Kuzco's personality.The plot was simple and honestly good and well based for a kids movie released in 2000. Not the best one you can have in a era like this,but if anybody could have the opportunity to see it in the cinemas i would still envy them, because this movie is worth watching it.The soundtrack as well as the characters of this movie were very good and gunny and funny and laughing tone to it,kinda helped it in many ways to continue the plot and the poor character development the characters had(poor according to many movies I say but a good one in a kid's movie,in which you can't understand many things after watching it for the first time.I truly enjoyed and had fun watching this and I was honestly expecting this to be true,i mean come on you is impossible to be unsatisfied with a Walt Disney movei based on an arrogant emperor and a fellow villager being chased by a creepy old woman and a comic releaf character, which by the way had a solo film somehow...yeah let's watch this one also.The animation was well and the environments also, nothing way to impressive and extraordinary to say about them,yeah they were well done nothing more.In summary,""The emperor's New groove"" is the perfect family movie and the best one you can see so you can remember it.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Nuts to the critics and public,"Most critics and ordinary moviegoers alike don't know what they're dismissing in The Emperor's New Groove. This movie was top notch Disney and a true modern masterpiece that has more of old Walt's spirit than any of Disney's other so called masterpieces since Aladdin. Only a few critics actually seemed to get it, and even those that praised it still missed the point by actually believing it was all about the comedy. All the rest trivialized it by pointing to a whole bunch of meaningless ""mistakes"". Its emphasis on story rather than tired formula and cliches wasn't seen, and its lack of silly, overblown musical numbers tying up the story was booed, not praised. Its old school animation was mistaken as weak, and its vibrant, original, and colorful characters were written off as unmemorable. None of this could be further from the truth. The Emperor's New Groove was stylish and sassy. It was a breath of fresh air that proved Disney was for once willing to flex their creative muscles and think outside the box. The characters were the most original and most memorable I had ever seen in a Disney movie. Not since the days of Lady and the Tramp had a movie like this come along. The Emperor's New Groove spoke to ""kids"" of all ages. It allowed everybody to laugh at it without going over kids' heads. And it spoke to kids without talking down to them, preaching, moralizing, or beating them over the head. The simple message was that selfishness was evil, and the movie brought that across politely through the use of story, without bursting into song. This was a message kids could actually use and learn from. And kudos to Disney for portraying a happy, normal, biologically sound family. No dead parents here, and I know there won't be any squirming kids because this is one of Disney's least violent movies. So kudos to Disney for what this is, a grand animated masterpiece in the tradition of the old school, and for what this isn't, more overstuffed moralizing grandeur following stale formula. And if I were a parent, I for one won't be afraid to let my kid watch this. Anybody else that didn't see this movie's beauty, well that's your opinion, but it's really a shame. I gave this movie a full 10, a score I haven't given an animated movie since Bambi. I would give it an 11 if I could.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney does Looney Tunes,"This cartoon is so unlike the Disney oeuvre. (That's the only fifty cent word I'll use. Promise.) Rather than being sweet, it is often cruel. Rather than sedate, it is slapstick. Even the animation style itself is exaggerated to un-Disney proportions.

Disney - tongue in cheek,"Who would have thought the writers at Disney would ever come up with  enough courage to do a whole movie that takes the genre and smashes it over the heads of everybody who expected to see an old-fashioned musical?This film is about as funny as a Douglas Adams novel - it's full of self-irony and you get the suspicion that some of it is a bit mean-spirited, but enjoying it means laughing your belly out and you just have to show it to all your friends. It's stuffed with tongue-in-cheek dialogue (I  L O V E the scene, in which Yzma and Kronk discuss whether to get rid of Kuzco before or after dinner - look for it in the quotes on this site!) and incredibly fast and funny animation with a sense of irreverence that not even Disney's ""Hercules"" was ready to deliver.Seems to have been written by some talented teenagers on an overdose of Monty Python, Jim Carrey and ""Futurama"". Thanks of course go to Robin Williams for leading the way with his unforgettable portrayal of a certain blue genie. He should probably be awarded a special Oscar for every new film Disney chunks out in memory of that performance with a great cast like this!And one last thing: Kronk definitely is the greatest stupid henchman in recent memory.

An underrated Disney classic,"When you think of Disney's animated classics (and some of the ones that are touted as 'classics' but really aren't) this film rarely comes up but I think it's well worth looking out for because in my opinion it's one of the funniest Disney films.Stripping back a lot of the usual Disney conventions like lots of songs and cute fluffy animals that will sell a lot of toys, this film is more about slapstick and verbal comedy which means it appeals to a wider age range than just kids. I know nowadays this is more common place but back in 2000 this was a big deal.It's bright, it's got a lot of charm and some decent vocal performances (though I can't hear John Goodman's voice these days and not think of Sulley from Monsters Inc) so once your kids have tired of Snow White and co I think The Emperor's New Groove would be worth a watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Worst animated Disney feature since A bug's Life,"I was strangely enough not too impressed by Disney's hit A Bug's Life and I must honestly say I preferred watching AntZ by DreamWorks. With this film Disney has his new rock bottom' for me, after such great animated flicks as Tarzan, Toy Story 2 and Dinosaur. Of course I do not mean rock bottom in a Mission of Mars kind of way. I just mean to say that this film shows that there are certain Disney movies that seem to be inferior to the rest. Like A Bug's Life, this is one of the few animated theatrical releases by Disney in the years since Aladdin, that doesn't breathe fun and excitement. I think that is mainly, because one has to try very hard liking the main character and because the story is not too good (emotion, action, comedy or romantic wise) as were all the other Disney animated features. I mean Hercules was not as epic as I wished but Pain & Panic surely made up for that, but in this film I just missed that kind of characters. This does not mean though, that The Emperor's New Groove stunk.

Light hearted Disney fun,"In The Emperor's New Groove, an emperor is turned into a llama by his evil ex administrator and works with a llama herder to get his throne back. Certainly not the most ambitious or sophisticated of animated films, TENG is a light heated buddy comedy which runs on comic gags and energetic jokes. In terms of entertainment level it hits the mark. The animation looks good and visually the film works well, but what makes it work is the humour. The film often resembles an automatic joke dispenser as the inventive, witty and biting gags never stop flowing and the film maintains a very good pace throughout. 90 minutes was definitely the right length for the movie and it manages not to run out of steam. Another fun thing about the film is how it is timeless since it's set in the past but features many modern elements. The script oozes with laughs and is amusingly meta, with the emperor providing some amusing narration throughout the film.There are problems with TENG though. The buddy relationship at the centre of the film is cliché, predictable and rushed, while the emperor himself is a pretty unlikable character. There are dips here and there, the consistently zany and funny atmosphere means tension falls by the wayside. Ultimately, this is never more than light entertainment although that isn't ultimately a problem even if it means you're unlikely to remember the film as much as some other Disney movies. With it's entertainingly over the top set pieces and fittingly silly tone, this will entertain many kids and some but not all of the adults. Disney just strip the story down to the comedy and entertainment here and it mostly works. An entertaining movie for the whole family to watch together, TENG hits the comedy notes with skill and is a good time. It's not a lot more than that but it is a jolly good time.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"It's not groundbreaking or fantastic animation like Pixar, but it more than gets the job done","What film is one part insane, one part extremely fast-paced, and overall a movie that breaks down the fourth wall so many times you are almost involved in the film itself? Well, there are multiple answers, but if there is one film that fits this description, it's The Emperor's New Groove. With stellar voice work, pacing that is faster than most films within the past decade, and also containing a dose of silliness that just doesn't happen in enough films, this Disney animated flick stands as the best amongst the animated Disney films (excluding Pixar) within the past three decades and easily the most underrated.While we see Stitch everywhere, the furious campaign behind Chicken Little, and the attempt to make a worldwide smash out of Dinosaur, Disney seemed to have little support towards this little flick. Nonetheless, this is the little film that could; as it defied lower-budgeted animation, defied a song listing, and delivered some of the funniest moments and one-liners in animated history. It also managed to destroy the long-running Seinfeld curse, as it made Patrick Warburton a solidified voice-acting star. Most amazing, David Spade was actually quite funny without the assistance of Chris Farley. The Emperor's New Groove follows a bratty prince by the name of Kuzco (David Spade) that lives without a care in the world as everyone caters to his every whim without question. When he fires his adviser though, things get interesting as Yzma (Eartha Kitt) and her dumb yet reliable assistant Kronk attempt to kill him, only to instead turn him into a llama. After the mishap, Kuzko needs to actually rely on someone other than himself (Pancha, voiced by John Goodman) to regain his position at the throne and stop Yzma. Easier said than done, as Kuzco must change his ways in order to succeed.Lilo and Stitch is not the black sheep of Disney films like advertised, its this one. With only one song, lack of detailed animation, total rundown of the fourth wall, and also a defiance of a plot without its holes, The Emperor's New Groove relies on quick, witty humor and its lively animation to keep the kids and adults entertained. To add to that, this is the first Disney film in ages to contain some true character development, as we see Kuzco slowly rise from a selfish brat into a likable character as he spends more time becoming a llama. Partly written and directed by Mark Dindal, his fast-paced animation and action techniques were perfected here after the underrated flop Cats Don't Dance years before.The voice acting is what carries this film from decent to beyond superb. From the zany and quick-witted David Spade, to the veteran John Goodman, to the funny and lively talents of Eartha Kitt and Patrick Warburton, those four ran the film with excellent one-liners, funny moments, and a chemistry that is very rare amongst animated films. Easily some of the best voice work in any animated film, as long as one of the four was at the screen talking, the laughs would just continue rolling in. We even have the late veteran John Fiedler lending his voice in a hysterical cameo. Easily quotable movie, and that is always a plus. One can say that this has a sort of Frat Pack comedic-like quality to it, as it doesn't rely on a deep story with morals, but instead on humorous situations and quirky lines to convince the viewer to watch again and again.Bottom Line: Among the best non-Pixar animated films within the past two decades, Emperor's New Groove is a fresh new look at the way Disney films are made. No longer do we have a romance story, no longer do we have a Disney princess in distress, we have a great cast of lovable characters in an environment that even gets the viewers involved. With a zany plot, clever one-liners, a lot of visual humor and a running time that never actually drags, there is really nothing really wrong with this movie. David Spade's last funny movie, the destruction of the Senfeld curse, and also the revival of Eartha Kitt's career can be found here. Watch it, no matter how old you are and what kinds of films you enjoy. Anyone that doesn't get a kick out of this one just doesn't have a sense of humor.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Boom baby!!,"This is a great movie, with amazing comedy and a good message. I love to watch it again and again.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Boom Baby!,"My Take: A wacky good time for the whole family.By the time the studio neared their heyday (before they start turning real bad), Disney made this hilarious and fast-aced adventure comedy and even took time to parody their own works. THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE is not the best Disney movie, and maybe not even for a long time, but that's alright. It's funny, energetic, colorful and, in some spots, it's actually clever. What more could I ask for? I guess, nothing more. THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE may have not brought out the best Disney can offer, but it still clearly shows their capabilities.One of the best pleasures of GROOVE is the ensemble comedic voice acting. The voice cast, which includes David Spade, Eartha Kitt, Patrick Warburton and John Goodman to list the names at the top-billing, are excellent and never lacking in joy and sharp comedic timing. Their comedic performances are more than enough to sustain adult attention, but not without letting the young 'uns down. If you don't find even one of their hilarious mischief at least amusing then you must have your funny bone ripped out of you body and the pain is excruciating. the entire film may not have been a comedic gold mine, but it comes close to rival any non-animated movie above a G-rating. In fact, I say it might put a few others to shame.Spade lends his outrageous voice talents to the spoiled Emperor Kuzco, who is used to his life of royalty (in Kuzco's term, ""Everyone is under my command"") since birth (in one hilarious scene, Baby Kuzco accidentally beheads his stuffed toy and soon a large number of hands reach out to him, each with a stuffed toy to give away). See, Kuzco wants to destroy a peasant village set upon a scenic hilltop so he can build his summer getaway home (Complete with water slide!). Despite the lead peasant Pacha's (voiced by John Goodman) attempt to halt construction, Kuzco does get everything he wants, right? So he thinks. After being fired by spoiled brat of an emperor, his ""loyal"" adviser Yzma (voiced with great presence by Eartha Kitt), which I may describe as a cross between Cruella DeVille and... well, Eartha Kitt, wants to get even with him. While hitting stone head replicas of him doesn't satisfy, Yzma plots instead to poison the emperor. But her plans failed, mainly due to the complete incompetence of her bumbling right-hand man Kronk (the hilarious Patrick Warburton lends his voice). Instead of a dead emperor, they just have one badly turned into a talking llama. Assisted by Pacha, Kuzco (the llama) tries to get back to the palace and change him back to human.True, some jokes falter and the story isn't first-class Disney story-telling, but I wasn't exactly looking for a smart straightforward Disney effort when the first frame appears before my face. The movie had me from the first frame and again, and again, and again later on. One of the main reasons this movie worked for me was that it packs one frame after another with enough juice to make us wait for the other. The movie is one funny moment followed by another, that's both for the young and old audiences. While kids will enjoy the silly humor and energy-packed madness, adults will find the talented voice cast and the smarter humor a real pleasure. Either way, THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE delivers what's coming to you.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Arguably Disney's Funniest Movie Ever Made,"This film remains one of Disney's biggest cult films to date, mainly for its fast paced slapstick humor, exaggerated animation, and lovable characters. Yet as celebrated as this movie is, there's also somewhat of a dark side to it, mainly due to its infamous troubled production. It was originally entitled Kingdom of the Sun, and it had an almost completely different narrative in mind. It was supposed to be an Incan retelling of The Prince & the Pauper and it even had a different crew on board, but due to countless of story problems and executive meddling, the original director Roger Allers and many others left the project and it was retooled by Mark Dindal and an almost completely new crew in less than two years. You'd think a movie out of such a nightmarish production would end up mediocre at best, but this particular movie is far from that, as it could make even the most tired person energetic and excited for how zany it is.Still set in the Incan era, an arrogant young emperor named Kuzco is transformed into a llama by his former advisor Yzma, who also gets rid of him. Upon encountering a village leader named Pacha, Kuzco trusts him to take him back to the palace and change him back into a human. From a narrative standpoint, the story is rather predictable, as it's the typical road trip buddy movie where the two main leads go through many trials and tribulations before trusting each other. However, what makes up for the weak storyline is the humor, characters and even the heart. Considering that Mark Dindal had previously directed Cats Don't Dance, the film pays a huge homage to the original Looney Tunes and the cartoons by Tex Avery. There's lots of fourth wall breaks, slapstick stunts, witty banter, fast-paced visual gags, exaggerated facial expressions, funny line deliveries, and even some jokes that will fly over kid's heads. It's no wonder you still hear people quoting lines like, ""demon llama"" or ""RIIIIIIIIGHT"".In addition, the characters are also enjoyable enough to warrant a watch. While Kuzco does start off rather callous, he does gravitate more towards Pacha and the people below him upon realizing that the world is much more than his arrogant self could have ever imagined. Although even at that, his selfish attitude is so delightfully narcissistic that he's hard not to giggle at, as he's like that kind of self centered dork you just love to hate. As for Pacha, he's the kind hearted and compassionate village man who despite going through Kuzco's ego, still sees the good in him and the tender moments he shares with the young emperor really display a lot of genuine heart, making it impossible to dislike him. However, the true standouts are Yzma and her bumbling assistant Kronk, as they provide the best laughs in the whole film and Eartha Kitt and Patrick Warburton really bring the two to life with their charisma and contrasting personalities. I won't talk about the rest as they're not as important to the narrative, aside from Pacha's subtly eccentric family, but all of the characters are humorous nonetheless.Finally, as stated before, the influence on Looney Tunes and Tom & Jerry is shown right on screen, especially with the character animation. While not all the characters move in a very dynamic and magnified fashion, the ones that do could make one crack up even with the tiniest of gestures. The character designs even emulate the Disney style to more of a Tex Avery format, especially when it comes to the visual gags that move at a cheetah's pace without feeling overbearing. One particular visual joke when Yzma and Kronk are chasing after Kuzco and Pacha to the palace is so subversive that it's hard to believe such a gag could ever come from the House of Mouse. While the backgrounds are fine but nothing too noteworthy, the effects animation is quite colorful (although not overly saturated) and filled with highly creative lights and shadows that really make them pop on screen. While Aladdin and Hercules may be the two other animated Disney ventures that come closest to matching the tone and style of classic cartoons, I think this film takes the cake and swallows it whole.Needless to say, The Emperor's New Groove practically re-writes the rules of what Disney animated films should do, mainly by being a highly entertaining slapstick buddy comedy rather than a classic story being adapted into a massive musical. Around this time, the studio would end up having its fair share of hits and misses, but this is one of the hits in terms of the company leading itself into experimental directions. They say animated movies should only aim for more challenging themes and epic scopes, but that doesn't mean we can't have a zany cartoony comedy like this every now and then. It's almost been 20 years since this film came out, and while it's hard to determine whether or not Kingdom of the Sun would have been better or not, at least we got something fresh and unique out of the Disney cannon that will still be beloved for many years to come.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Best Disney in many years!,"I have been rather unhappy with Disney's offerings since Little Mermaid and Beaty and the Beast, although Lion King was decent too. The others since have left me cold, so luckily my love for animation was satisfied by the Aardman shorts & Chicken Run, the Pixar trilogy (Bug's Life & Toy Stories) amd Antz. But here, out of the blue with no previews in the movie theaters I frequent, comes this wonderful movie!Once again, Disney has used a classic tale, of a powerful but cruel and self centered individual being thrown into a scary situation with one of his lowliest underlings, and coming out a much improved person for the experience (the examples are many, but A Christmas Carol is a good example of the genre.) In this film, the powerful one is the Emperor (Kuzco - voiced by David Spade) of a Mayan/Aztec type rural kingdom. The underling is the peasant (Pacha - voiced by John Goodman) who herds the Emperor's llamas. The scary situation is the Emperor's scheming advisor (Yzma - voiced by Eartha Kitt), an almost Cruela DeVil type withered and scary old crone who fancies herself as vastly more attractive than she is, and her body building / gourmet cooking / dimwitted- yet- strangely- resourceful boy-toy / chair carrier / bodyguard (Kronk - voiced by Patrick Warburton ...don't know him? he does the voice of Buzz Lightyear in the TV show version of the Toy Story spinoffs...same kind of voice as Tim Allen in the same role.) The neat thing about the voice talent is that the characters are made to look pretty much like the actors (Eartha must have a really good sense of humor!)Anyway, it is no spoiler to say that the Emperor gets turned into a llama (she was trying to kill him with a magic potion, to be administered by Kronk, who screws up the dosage hence the odd result) and the advisor takes over the kingdom. She tasks Kronk with taking the llama out into the country and killing it, but he fails her (similar to the huntsman in Snow White, but funny this time.) When she gets word that the llama is on the loose, not dead, she takes matters into her own hands (Snow White again) and sets off in search of the talking critter with Kronk carrying her chair around with her in it...this makes for lots of funny scenes.Ant that is what this film is about (besides the moral-of-the-story aspect). It is simply a great time for all ages. The colorful scenery and nonstop slapstick is good for the kids, while the constant stream of sight gags, topical references, satire and parody delight the adults. This film has a much wittier script than most Disneys, and get this...it's a cartoon, not a musical. The characters do not sing songs at every drop of a hat. Only the Emperor gets an opening song to tell us what a great guy he thinks he is. This characteristic also sets the film apart from other Disneys.I was interested to see that the credits list very little in the way of computer animation. Also, the work seems to have taken place in Disney's tiny animation facility in their park in Florida (seems that another recent one was made entirely there) instead of in California.

The funniest Disney film every made,"The Emperors New Groove is quite frankly one of the most quirky animated movie you can find, it should have been a hit but failed to make good at the box office.the jokes are beyond classic and when watching this film you should expect the unexpected, it's pretty obvious that it's done by the same makers of Cats Cant Dance due to it's animation style but if it's not then i've made a huge error.you'll probably never see a movie like the emperors new groove again, i one day hope to prove myself wrong by writing such a movie which will be difficult because these sort of movies tend to suck all the good ideas out of the world and put them into one surefire hit, so it'll be a difficult task to even get close to this level of hilarity.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Not just an average Disney effort, but something more","I went in with my two children expecting a modestly funny Disney effort. I was pleasantly surprised. The plot was pretty straightforward, but the humor was a great mix of slapstick, sly references, puns and sarcastic laughs. A nice message for kids in this age of ""affluenza"" about how being self-centered is not the way to go through life. All in all a great family film.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Delightful,"Found myself laughing out loud today seeing some of the sight gags of this film including Esme's laughably low boobs. Who did that? It's genious. ""Scary beyond all reason."" Ha! Cracks me up.This movie has such a great character mix and I love the heroes and the villains alike. They're all a bit hapless and each have their moments of treachery which I am very partial to in animated films. I can't stand the overly saccharine and I do love me some salt and spice. However saying this I agree the humor of this movie never veered into the tasteless or flat. I think beyond all the jokes the main story was endearing, and this was never overshadowed or cheapened by crudity even though there were places where it could have been.To get to the main story, yes the relationship between King Cusco the talking llama (David Spade) and his accidental farmer guide (John Goodman) was believable in the way they bonded and weaved between trusting and untrusting behaviors. I rather could see several of my own relationships in the kind of arc that this one went through in this film, and I could recognize several points of commonality, from the distance to the reluctant acceptance to the loss and rebuilding of promise and trust. Rather remarkable really. I don't doubt you might find something of yourself in these characters too.I'm a fan. You might be able to tell by my high rating: 9/10. This isn't a mistake-I think there are really few films that can make you want to be a little more sociable and neighborly like this one does. King Cusco is clearly selfish but the movie goes to great lengths not to depict him as bad or heartless. He very much earns both his monikers: the movie demonstrates his acts of selfishness and his acts of perhaps something else we might consider good.Even Esme (is that her name) is recognizable in her flamboyance and penchant for ""cruel ironies.""More enjoyable is the farmer guy not averse to a bit of misdirection to save his home. This guy was getting a bit overly sweet for me but I'm glad the filmmakers recognized the deviousness he possessed. It was well done when his expression changed from increasingly frustrated to forcibly calm in an instant. I like the shades of character they could paint him in.I consider this film a gem-it does actually convince me that the seemingly heartless may not be so. And that's valuable. I couldn't really ask for more in a film.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

One of Disney's greatest... and most underrated.,"I first came in touch by chance. It was laying around my aunt's house and in my boredom I started watching it. By looking at th box I wasn't very amused (it was a story about a llama, how good could that be...) After the first 10 minutes of the movie I was laughing so hard that all my family joined me shocked by my reaction to a kid's movie. Well it isn't a kid's movie. It has a very fine and mature sense of humor in its dialog, some of which most children won't be able to grasp, yet for teens and adults its hilarious. Spade's ironic voice just fits perfectly in the roll. I first watched it when I was 16, know I am 20 and I still crack up ever time I watch that movie.

Great one,"Originally developed as an epic called Kingdom of the Sun, The Emperor's New Groove lost scale and most of Sting's song score (some of which can be heard on the soundtrack) on its way to the screen. The end result is the lightest Disney film in many a moon, a joyous romp akin to Aladdin in its quotient of laughs for kids and adults. The original story centers on the spoiled teenage emperor Kuzco (David Spade), who enjoys getting the best of his Aztecan subjects. When he fires Yzma (Eartha Kitt), his evil sorceress, she seeks revenge and turns Kuzco into a llama with the help of her hunk of the month, a Link named Kronk (Patrick Warburton). Alone in the jungle, the talking llama is befriended by Pacha (John Goodman), who has just been told to vacate his pastoral home by the human Kuzco. What's an ego to do? That's pretty much the story and the characters--simple, direct, fun--a Disney film on a diet. For any fan of the acidic humor of Spade, this is essential viewing. As narrator of his tale, Kuzco uses a sarcastic tone to keep the story jumping with plenty of fun asides (he even ""stops"" the film at one point to make sure you know the story is about him). Even better is character actor Warburton (Elaine's stuck-up boyfriend on Seinfeld), who steals every scene as the dim-witted, but oh-so-likable Kronk. There's even a delicious Tom Jones number that starts the film off with a bang.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

One of the few Disney films anyone can enjoy.,"What makes this film so great is that I didn't even see it until I was 15 years old, and yet it instantly became one of my favourite Disney movies of all time. It's not a musical like most Disney cartoons before it, which makes it much easier to take in (since you don't have to worry about those ""cringe"" moments that happen so often in other Disney musicals). The writing was great, but what really made it better than great was the voice acting. I can full-heartedly say that this movie had the best voice cast I've ever seen come out of Disney. Eartha Kitt, John Goodman, David Spade, and (my personal favourite character in the film) Patrick Warburton all created terrific characters. The animation was very original - a style I hadn't seen yet in a Disney cartoon. The plot as a whole was probably the weakest part of the film, but its simplicity is part of what makes everything else that's so great about the movie stand out. Watching it over and over again, I keep finding new lines of dialogue that I'm happy to quote (especially from Kronk, who, as I said, was my favourite character). What makes the movie truly great, however, is that it never stops being entertaining. There are only a couple very brief ""Disney"" moments - by which I mean those moments that attempt to evoke some serious emotion - but they're short enough to avoid requiring the viewer to cringe, and still manage to entertain thanks to what usually ends up being a cleverly-written line at the end of it. This is one of only two Disney-made movies that have earned my 10/10, and it earned it because it never ceased to entertain me.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
what has happened to Disney's movies!?,"THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE was a big hit-and-miss to me. At only 77 minutes, it was too long. Perhaps if the story had had a quicker pace and funnier jokes, it would have seemed to go by quicker. As it is, it had only one or two really good jokes about every ten or fifteen minutes, and the space in-between them just seemed to drag and drag. I found myself laughing the most during the climax, when Yzma (expertly-voiced by Eartha Kitt) is turned into a cat and attempts to steal the potion that will turn Kuzco back into a human, and only occasionally throughout the rest of the film. The characters were well-cast (particularly Kitt, John Goodman, Patrick Warburton, and Wendie Malick), but David Spade got rather annoying after awhile. There were also (thankfully) no songs, with the exception being the opening sequence, featuring a funny little character that sings the opening song, voiced by Tom Jones.I wish Disney could back to making the kind of animated movies they used to do, like THE RESCUERS DOWN UNDER (still my favorite animated Disney movie), ROBIN HOOD, LITTLE MERMAID, and the other classics. Heck, even BEAUTY AND THE BEAST was better than this one. (MULAN and A BUG'S LIFE are the only recent animated Disney films I liked.) Maybe the film would have been better had the studio stuck with the original story (and partially already produced film), which from what I understand was a more serious film. Little kids will like the comical situations, but probably won't have the attention span to sit through the whole thing, while adults will like some of the jokes and feel the movie has already been on two hours by the time it gets thirty minutes in.",,Anonymous,Animation

A nice time-passer worth your time,"Okay, it's a fact that not every Disney full-length cartoon can be as magical and transcendent as BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, BAMBI or LITTLE MERMAID. So because some other full-length Disney films such as LILO AND STITCH and THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE are a bit of a let-down isn't a bad thing nor does it mean they are bad films--it's just that these other films are so perfect that you can't help but make comparisons. Fortunately, the intended audience for this film (kids) don't usually make this comparison and I was just happy that the movie didn't make the history teacher within me scream like it did when I saw POCAHONTAS! The movie is about a selfish Incan leader. While anachronisms and historical inaccuracies might have been a problem, Disney wisely made the time period very vague and it's pure fantasy. Sure, witches like the one played by Eartha Kitt did not exist in ancient Peru, but it was obvious to everyone watching that this was not meant to be a history lesson--just silly fun with a decent central message.

"Despite a troubled production history, The Emperor's New Groove is pretty entertaining if not all that ambitious.","Emperor Kuzco (David Spade) is the arrogant, entitled, and mean spirited ruler of the Incan Empire whose every whim is catered to out of fear of upsetting him. Following yet another instance of Yzma (Eartha Kitt), Kuzco's adviser, going beyond her duties and ruling behind Kuzco's back, Kuzco fires her as his adviser. Meanwhile Kuzco summons Pacha (John Goodman), the peasant leader of a nearby hilltop village, to tell him his village will be destroyed for construction of his Summer home much to Pacha's chagrin. Yzma angered by Kuzco's firing of her enacts a plan of revenge with her good natured simpleton henchman, Kronk (Patrick Warburton), and attempts to poison Kuzco but circumstances lead to him being turned into a llama instead. Kronk fails to kill Kuzco and as a result Kuzco ends up at Pacha's village in llama form but still able to talk. Kuzco tries to get home but Pacha refuses to help unless he halts plans of destroying his village.The Emperor's New Grove has a fascinating production history that's practically a story in itself (see the 2002 documentary The Sweatbox for additional details). Originally the follow-up project by director Roger Allers after scoring the critical and commercial hit with The Lion King, Allers selected making a film themed after Incan culture as Disney was interested in using ancient cultures as basis for feature films. This initially lead to the initial stage of the project known as Kingdom of the Sun/Kingdom in the Sun (the name went back and forth) with Allers given largely free reign on casting and story. The movie initially took its setup from The Prince and the Pauper with Kuzco and Pacha being lookalikes who trade places while Yzma planned to block out the sun and like other Disney Renaissance films would have elements of romantic comedy mixed with musical segments. Following the disappointing returns of Pocahontas and Hunchback of Notre Dame, Disney executives became nervous over the more dramatic tone of Allers version of the film which brought in director Mark Dindal who'd finished Cats Don't Dance for Warner Bros. In the hopes he could bring more levity and humor to the film. As the film struggled with contrasting visions of Dindal and Allers, Allers stepped aside and allowed the studio to go with Dindal's take on the material. Upon release the film received decent reviews, but performed below expectations making $169 million against its $100 million budget. Despite its financial failure, The Emperor's New Groove is a lot better than its troubled production would suggest even if it doesn't measure up to the heights Disney set for themselves.At its core, The Emperor's New Groove is essentially a buddy comedy with heavy emphasis on screwball and slapstick humor which isn't surprising when you consider Dindal's previous directorial effort Cats Don't Dance was also predicated upon that very fast paced and exaggerated comedic style where the film is pretty simple and essentially a delivery system for gags. The movie's humor with its more simplified character models and ""elastic"" take on physics makes this one of the more uniquely animated Disney films as its spiritually closer to something Warner Bros. Would animate as opposed to Disney who didn't usually tackled this kid of comedy. To a degree Disney did try to attempt this sort of humor with Hercules, but that was also trying to be taken semi seriously as a ""superhero film"" and also was trying to play itself for pathos. In this regard The Emperor's New Groove is a more refined version of Hercules as its more streamlined and focused with a more consistent tone. David Spade and John Goodman are engaging as our leads, but the scene stealers of the movie are undeniably our villains with Earth Kitt as Yzma and Patrick Warburton as Kronk. Both these performers are great on their own and combined with the excellently timed animation and character quirks such as Kronk's deep love for cooking the movie gives some really strong character based humor in its strongest setpieces.The Emperor's New Groove may have been troubled behind the scenes but the end result is a fairly entertaining comedy adventure. There is a tragic sense of ""what could've been"" to this story with nervous executives not having faith in the initial product and if you've seen The Sweatbox it's all the more heartbreaking, but considering how some other troubled productions have ended this is probably one of the better ways it could've ended.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

All of that is all fine, though it's the humour that makes this film tick. It isn't belly laugh worthy but from start-to-finish I was amused by the funny nature of it.The premise is very silly, which works in its favour, with a load of things that don't quite add up, it even references that itself in the third act. That just adds to the fun, they know it's a mindless 78 minutes and make it work.The reason it comes out so well is thanks to David Spade and John Goodman. Spade is terrific as Kuzco, bringing the perfect wit to the self-serving emperor. Goodman is the overall star though, I thoroughly enjoyed him in the role of Pacha.

Comedic gold,"This movie is a comedic classic, there's no other way to say it. Almost very scene is sprouting with energy and humour, even the more quiet ones are still hilarious in their own way. Under the surface however, there's quite a bit of depth present, almost a surprising amount. Kuzco is once of my favorite characters of all time, and he goes through an almost perfectly written arc, from basically a villain to super likable. This is of course achieved through his interactions with Pacha, which are very down to earth and realistic. And of course, we can't talk about this movie without Kronk and Yzma, quite possibly some of the best side characters in any Disney film. Kronk is such a likable guy and super funny, while Yzma has a very entertaining obsession with getting rid of Kuzco. Ultimately, what makes this movie such a treat is the energy it has, and the chaotic nature of each individual scene.

"Mildly amusing Disney but lacking inspiration, originality and innovation","Kuzco (David Space), is a spoilt and heartless 18-year old ruler of the Inca Empire, who is planning to build himself a giant holiday home. He summons Pacha (John Goodman) to tell him that he, his family, and the rest of the village must make way for his lavish plans and find somewhere else to live. Kuzco also fires Yzma (Eartha Kitt), his adviser, and in her fury she plans to poison him and ruling in his absence. Yzma's dim-witted but lovable henchman Kronk (Patrick Warburton) gives Kuzco the wrong poison, and instead turns him into a llama. She trusts Kronk to finish the job, but he doesn't have the heart to let Kuzco die and eventually loses him amongst the villagers. Stranded in the jungle with his new llama body, he entrusts Pacha to protect him and return him to his palace, without having any intentions of changing his holiday home plans.After a hugely troubled production (the title was originally Kingdom in the Sun and the plot involved a peasant look-a-like and a llama herder love-interest), The Emperor's New Groove arrived in 2000 to enjoy slim box-office success, something that Disney would have to get used to. The decision to swap the old-fashioned love story and moral preachings for a more silly and modern buddy-movie was a wise one, and film benefits especially from the work of Patrick Warburton, the man with possibly the best voice in comedy (he also does the voice of paraplegic Joe in Family Guy). Yet the tale is still an overly-familiar one, with the enlightenment of an ignorant rich kid amongst mixing with the lower- classes failing to find anything original to say.The character of Kuzco is especially loathsome, but where usually the actor/voice artist would be talented enough to make the character endearing, in the hands of David Space, an actor of such a startling lack of talent, is annoying, and remains annoying throughout. There were times where I felt like shouting at Pacha to just kick him off a cliff. I found the whole experience quite charmless, and in an age of high- definition CGI animation, it is nice to see Disney take a traditional approach. Yet where their early films such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and Bambi (1942) were drawn with expert beauty and love, Groove just looks lazy and heartless. It's not a total failure, the film is sporadically funny with the aforementioned Kronk getting most of the laughs, and Earth Kitt does some fine work as the twisted Yzma. But it's no wonder Disney would buy Pixar, as judging from this they were lacking from anything resembling inspiration or innovation.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

Good film,"Good film. Kuzco to Pacha's typical Hollywood-acting family, and from David Spade's narration to Kronk's (Yzma's sidekick) big oaf personality. Everywhere you turn, there are gags, modern-day dialog and more humor, which can be distracting in a movie that is supposedly set in ancient times. The plot is simple with few twists and turns, as it mostly concentrates on Pacha trying to help Kuzco get back his throne, with Yzma and Kronk in pursuit.

A llama? He's supposed to be dead!,"After the Disney renaissance era, the company wanted to make a movie set in ancient Peru called Kingdom of the sun. Which was supposed to a musical adaptation of the Prince and the pauper. But after Roger Allers couldn't do much with such premise, he gave away the idea to Mark Dindal, and he changed the tone to a more silly one. Even if it bombed at the box office, it was still warmly received by critics and as years passed, loved by audience of all ages around the globe. What exactly did they find in this film that took years and even decades of discovering? The only way to find out is by reading this review.The story is a little bit cliche, the spoiled emperor named Kuzco (David Spade) fired his advisor Yzma (Eartha Kitt) and plans to build Kuzcotopia on a hill, where Pacha (John Goodman) residents. Meanwhile Izma and her henchman Kronk (Patrick Warburton) tried to create their revenge plan, by poisoning the spoiled Prince. However, the potion didn't work well, and Kuzco turns into a llama. Later, when Pacha meets up with Kuzco in the middle of the night and realise they are far from the palace. So both need to go through the jungles to go back. There were a lot of films before and after, where the protagonists go through the development from hating to helping and supporting each other, and sure, this may seem like a pretty simple premise. But there are a lot things that make the whole plot more fun and engaging.First of all, there are lot's of fun ideas that are creative in their own way. I liked the potions that could turn you into any animal, this sounds like a silly kids' dream. I mean, who wouldn't want to transform into their favorite creature? Even if not, you still have to admit that it takes this idea to it's advantage. Especially when Kuzco took random potions to turn back, and at the same time running away from Yzma. Not to mention, the humour is just great. There are lot's of types of humour, including references to older movies, slapstick, irony, and just awkward moments. Each scene is gold, and if they don't make you laugh out loud, then at least, they'll make you giggle or chuckle. I especially liked Kronk's shoulder angel and devil that what to do and not to do, Bucky the squirrel that can talk to Kronk with squakes, and Kuzco's disguise as a lady in the cafe.The cast is unforgettable! Kuzco had one of the best character developments in animation history. He started off as a selfish emperor who enjoys having fun and not caring about others' feelings. But after he found himself as an animal and realized that he's no longer at the top of society, he understands that others need love, care and help if they are needed. He truly becomes humble throughout the journey. Pacha is the opposite of our protagonist, he's a kind hearted average man who even has a family and wants to protect his small village from being replaced by Kuzcotopia. He can be relatable to some older people who watch the movie. Moving to the antagonists, Yzma is the witch that wants revenge on Kuzco due to his behavior. Her attitude at being wickedly smart and evil makes her one of the more memorable villains in animation. She also has anger issues, that makes her hilarious. Finally, Kronk is the brawns overs brains type, who acts dumb, yet still secretly a good person who all he wants is to become a scout. And I love how he always comes up with some of the best jokes in the film. As for voice actors, all of them gave each character a unique voice that fits them well! I can hear that they felt everything in the script and used all their emotions and energy onto them. Minor characters are great too, like Pacha's children, Bucky, the waitress and the old advisor. Not as important as the main ones, but still as enjoyable.Finally the animation is the cherry on top of this feature. It's a little bit more abstract than previous works, by having more shape like designs in characters' designs. The backgrounds are nice to look at. Including the lab, the palace and the jungle. Each has more than enough details, which truly represent each location. And although it ain't a musical, it has a couple of songs and a nice soundtrack in general.This is a must watch for animation, Disney and Comedy fans. It's something that you shouldn't miss out. If you haven't seen this film, then I recommend you do so know. If you did, then it's not a bad idea to rewatch it. Either way, you'll find yourself having a pleasant and fun time with these characters. It may be different from previous works for not being to serious, but that's what makes Emperor's new groove special!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

An Underrated Gem,"This is one of Disney's hidden gems. This movie is usually seen on underrated Disney movie lists, and with good reasoning.

A grudgingly enjoyable experience,"I gotta say upfront that I despise Disney. Oh, not the Disney of my childhood (20-25 years ago), which brought me fascinating, sometimes cutting edge animation movies such as Jungle Book. No, I mean Michael Eisner's Disney, the soulless marketing machine that has leeched away its creativity in its quest to boost the stock price.So my wife and I attended ""New Groove"" reluctantly, and only because it was the sole movie at the 24-theatre multiplex that was on at the right time and wasn't sold out. I rated it a 6, and have no problem stating that ""New Groove"" is the most original movie from Disney since, perhaps, pre-Little Mermaid days.Good things: Voices (David Spade was perfectly whiney, the guy who played Puddy on Seinfeld was great as the oaf assistant, and Eartha Kitt was a purrrrrfectly evil villian), NO INSIPID SONGS, no cutesy sidekick characters for alleged comic relief, and maybe best of all, NEW GROUND was broken. For once we watched a movie headed into who knows what direction (of sure, the overall plot was predictable, but the details were interesting), and we saw things that were oddly inexplicable but endearing (this emperor like to dance, hence The Groove).Bad things: The inexplicable but endearing stuff was never fully utilized (what, no raves at the palace?), the movie dragged at times during the llama emperor's journey, and, ultimately, you didn't really care about any of these characters. You just wanted to have fun.So a grudging tip of the hat to Disney. Judging from the lack of commercial and marketing support you guys don't know exactly how to present ""New Groove,"" and maybe that is why it is your best animated film in a decade.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

The simplified animation, smarmy campiness, and attempts to appear relevant fall completely flat in this Disney animated feature.

One of the most hilarious Disney movies!,"The Emperor's New GrooveVoices of David Spade, John Goodman, Wendie Malick, Eartha Kitt and Patrick WarburtonGenre: Animation/Family/ComedyRated: GThis is one of my most favorite animated Disney movies yet! The jokes were very funny! The movie is about a young emperor named Kuzco (voiced by David Spade) who is the big time ruler of the land and then one day when he catches Yzma (voiced by Eartha Kitt) sitting in his throne he fires her.So now Yzma is wanting to get revenge on Kuzco, along with Yzma's big and funny sidekick, Kronk (Warburton). So Yzma decides to make a poison for Kuzco and then when they give him the poison, she and Kronk find out it was llama potion! So then Kuzco gets turned into a llama and then later meets up with Pacha (John Goodman), who then helps him back to get back to his palace so he can get changed back. But Pacha and Kuzco didn't really see each other closely at first. Meaning they didn't get of on the right foot.So when Yzma finds out Kuzco is still alive, she and her sidekick, Kronk go of to find them. My most favorite part was when Kuzco gets chased by panthers and then Pacha saves him and then they get wrapped on a tree and then Pacha saids ""Don't worry were safe"", and then the tree breaks and then when they land in the water Kuzco saids ""Don't tell me we are about to go down a big waterfall right?"" ""Yep"" ""Sharp rocks at the bottom?"" ""Most likely"" ""Bring it on!"" The movie has good moral to it. The moral of the story is working together and friendship.

"Quirky, Middling Disney Feature","Not at the top of my watchlist obviously after almost 25 years, but it was worth watching if not in the upper tier of animated Disney films.Definitely stands out for its setting of the Incan Empire, though it represents the look and design much more than it does the culture. The plot is pretty lightweight as well and again doesn't seem to reflect the locale.Seems to have much in common with Loony Tunes in action/violence scenes which was unusual.Casting was also unusual in my mind with my favorites being Eartha Kitt and John Fiedler. I wasn't as convinced that others like David Spade, Wendie Malick and Patrick Warburton while distinctive fit the story/setting.Seemed quite short at just 78 minutes.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Nothing is that simple of course, cue, the hilarious and frantic beginning, middle and end of a non stop roller-coaster ride.

Does this movie still manage to put me in a good groove? Check out my review below!,"""The Emperor's New Groove"" (2000), when I was a child, I heard the constant ads and commercials about this film. I debated whether I wanted to go see it in the movie theater or not. In the end, I didn't go into the theater to watch it. Then, during my birthday the following year, one of my friends gave me a video tape of it as a present (oh, the old-school days of VHS and VCR!) I watched it, and I loved it right away! From there, I couldn't stop watching it. Thinking about it during this day, I could kick myself for not going to see it in a theater. This is one of those movies that would have been a lot of fun to watch on the big screen! Still, if it wasn't for my friend, I probably wouldn't have seen how good this film was. It has an exciting and funny storyline, fantastic voice acting, beautiful animation and a phenomenal soundtrack. The plot is, an egotistical emperor named Kuzco, who is the leader of the Inca kingdom, punishes anyone who throws off his groove. He soon drinks a potion (originally meant to be poison) that turns him into a llama! From there, Yzma, his advisor, tries to get rid of him and take over as empress. Now, to some, it sounds like your average everyday adventure story where the greedy one learns life lessons and grows up in the end. Yes, it is that, but it's expressed in such a fun and unique way where it's completely fresh and original. The story keeps you invested all the way from beginning to end, every joke hits bullseye and you have a blast while watching it. This film takes every advantage possible and has fun with each of them. It keeps you invested and laughing all the way through, which is what a perfect animated movie should do. Props to the writers! The voice acting is nothing short of top-notch. David Spade is perfect as Kuzco, John Goodman is fantastic as Pacha, Eartha Kitt is very funny and perfectly sinister as Yzma, Patrick Warburton is hilarious as Kronk, etc. Every performance is hit right out of the ballpark and they really nail their respectable characters! The animation is very well-done and has aged well to this day. I, myself, prefer 2D animated movies and shows over 3D ones any day! Finally, the soundtrack is phenomenal and it sets the perfect tone for the story. It's fun, exciting yet comedic which is what helps tie it all together. Props to you, John Debney. You have composed a brilliant film score! ""The Emperor's New Groove"" is an animated marvel. I can watch this movie over and over again and never be bored with it. Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""The Emperor's New Groove"", what are you waiting for? Go watch it! As much as I enjoyed it as a kid, I think I love it more as an adult. That's right, no matter how old you are, it's a perfect film for all ages. It will definitely improve your groove. Go and see it today, or else Yzma might turn you into a llama!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney lost it.,"Let's face it people, Disney completely lost it on this one. The movie was very poorly written. The contemporary atmosphere in a historical setting was too much of a rip-off of any time travel film. Some of it's ""jokes"" were so lame I could barf. Then the writers took two shots at gay people. It's people like that I can't stand at all. And this was a family film, so they were trying to preach hate to children. May I ask why? Just because they have a different sexuality than the writers? Think about it sometime. Anywho, the animation wasn't too good either. Disney is supposed to have a reputation for constantly changing the art of animation, yet they have to use the techniques used in the Scooby-Doo shows back in the 80's.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

the best Disney's ever made,"Emperor's New Groove is the best Disney movie I've ever seen. It creativity and humor appeal to all age groups, not just little kids.

Yzma's plot was to kill Kuzco and become ruler, but her plan failed miserably when Krock, her right-hand man who has the brain capacity of a flea, gives Kuzco the wrong potion. In his quest to return to human form, he runs into a friendly peasant named Pacha. Pacha and Kuzco start heading back to the castle, where Yzma is getting a little too comfortable in Kuzco's throne.I think every person in the world should see this movie.

Genius wrapped in a goofy-looking box,"""The Emperor's New Groove"" obviously falls into one of two categories for most people: ""I Loved It"", or ""I Hated It"". There's a large segment of society that loves the simplicity and innocence of the Disney formula: Beautiful visuals, moralistic value-reaffirmation, and escapism. The millions of people that flock to their movies and to their theme parks are craving this type of entertainment.To these people, ""Emperor's New Groove"" didn't fit the mold. It was, bluntly, a Looney Tunes/Tom and Jerry/Woody Woodpecker full-length comedy movie dressed up from the outside like a Disney film. The trailers were hacked-up from the movie's previous incarnation as the epic drama ""Kingdom Of The Sun"", so they could be forgiven for not knowing that they would be seeing a 78 minute movie with the same level of entertainment as Wile E. Coyote getting an Anvil dropped on his head, or Daffy Duck being shot until his beak falls off by Elmer Fudd. They left the theaters somewhat justified in their disappointment and dislike of the film.But some of us... those of us that grew up on Television, on Saturday Morning Cartoons, on Fred Flintstone, Yogi Bear, Bugs Bunny, The Road Runner, JabberJaw, The Banana Splits... this was the movie from Disney that we'd all been waiting for. This was FUNNY. Not ""hmmmm, that was humorous and a good lesson to boot!"", but ""HAW HAW HAW KUZCO GOT A MOUTH FULL OF BEES!!!"". Humor for humor's sake. Laughter for laughter's sake. The characters were just that... CHARACTERS. We weren't expected to identify with any of them, we were just expected to laugh at (and with) them.How this movie made it past Disney Corporate in it's final form, I'll never know. I know that Disney had already sunk millions into ""Kingdom"", and wanted to get something, ANYTHING from their investment, and turned to Mark Dindal, who made the criminally underrated ""Cats Don't Dance"". The end result is unlike any other non-Pixar Disney movie ever: irreverent, hilarious, engaging.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

One of the funnier Disney movies,"The start is a bit strange, with a really unlikeable protagonist (with the magnificient David Spade interpretation), a particularly original visual design and the inclusion of flashbacks, with the lead remembering how he ended up in the situation that he starts with, also unusual. But the movie gets progressively better and funnier, and when it gets to the half (or start of the third act), everything break loose into a wild, ridiculous and more than anything, impossibly fun half/ending. The jokes are for kids, for adults, fourth wall breaking, and meanwhile we get more and more heartfelt moments, creating an uplifting good story without the need of forced monologues or melodramatics musicals.One last thing: Besides the great Spade, Patrick Warburton as Kronk and Eartha Kitt as Yzma gave a lot of soul to their comedic lines with their acting and voices. Even the awful John Goodman is not a disaster as ""Pacha"".",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not good enough for Disney,"Let me say first that I am a Disney fan. No doubt about that. I own most of his ""Classics"" on DVD. But this one simply is not good enough for a Disney movie. The story is far too thin for a movie, the humor is not as good as we normally see from Disney, there is no really bad villain. The music is good, however. That is one positive point. While watching this movie I wondered more and more why Disney made it at all and after that why he decided to release it. It would better have stayed on the shelves, for later revision or for eventual placement into the dustbin. Recently I read that the script had been re-written several times and that most of the movie was re-made because Disney was not happy with it. So what what we see now is the second or third trial, that for one reason or another was released. The main problem with this movie is -as said- that there simply is no strong story line. It is a collection of events, some of which are funny but most not funny at all. Nowadays Disney makes two or three movies a year, whereas in the past he made one in every two or three years. Maybe that is the main problem. The show must go on and on, with more and more output. So see it, if you are a Disney fan, but don't buy it. Luckily Disney can do better, as recent movies like ""Tarzan"" and ""Atlantis"" show!",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Fun, fun, fun!","Well, I've just watched my brand new DVD of ""The emperor's new groove"" and, as all the other thousand times I watched it, I loved it. I've always thought (as many other people) that a great children movie is a movie for everybody, and this is the case. This film has every quality to be considered not just a cartoon, but an excellent comedy.This is my favorite Disney movie, mainly because it is so atypical for Disney. First of all, there aren't only stereotypical bad guys and good guys, you can see all degrees of good and bad. Also, you can see that people (or llamas :) ) are able to change. Secondly, there's irony, a characteristic not very common to be depicted in a children movie. There's even a very subtle sexual undertone in some scenes (Yzma changing assistants for younger ones; Yzma lifting her skirt), subtle enough not to disturb children but to amuse grown-ups. Thirdly, there are plenty of details and gags! In this sense, it reminds of old classical movies and series, always with a twist. But the most important thing is absurd: I saw this film lots of times and I keep finding out-of-place, out-of-time elements that make the setting unique and funny in itself (that reminded me a lot of ""Top secret!""). You can laugh for hours just by noting these little things.The characters are round and quite complex, as I said before. It is also refreshing to see a movie about friendship, not romantic as many other previous ones. And I love that tough, clumsy, very guy-ish kind of friendship, without many words or gestures of affection. The plot is simple but rich, with a nice message for kids and a good depiction of the process of change.I'd like to add, for English-speaking readers, that I've watched the movie in Spanish too and it's exactly as enjoyable as the original. The Spanish script and voices were very carefully created, and I always appreciated this feature in those Disney movies I saw in both languages.Basically, and mainly, it's a happy movie, and that's why I love seeing it so often: because it makes me happy every time.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Brilliant brilliant brilliant!,"How can anyone miss this?! This is simply the best Disney movie ever made. It's a classic example of how a good story is the most essential element of any movie, whether animated or otherwise. All of the characters have been carefully chosen for their vocal abilities and have pulled off their respective roles perfectly. What is notable is that this movie did not rely on computer animation tricks, but instead used old-fashioned Disney animation. Music and songs are kept to a minimum, and mushy, over-the-top sentimentality is nowhere to be seen. It is just a clean, entertaining story packed with visual and auditory jokes that demand a repeated viewing (actually our family has probably watched it upwards of 20 times now, as it is a favorite of our daughter's).Anyone who claims that this is the worst movie made by Disney (or any of the actors associated with it) just did not listen closely enough to what the characters say.

Strikes a good family balance.,"This movie is a Disney staple in our home. Spades Kuzco provides the appropriate amount of trademark sarcasm and wit, along with the rest of the characters appeal to make a movie that hasn't gotten old yet. Most of the jokes are funny enough to make an adult laugh, but not too over the top to miss the kids. As was said in the behind the scenes on the DVD, most jokes are only funny the first time they are told, but many of the key scenes in this movie are funny every time ie: Waterfall scene, trotting out the ladies, and the diner scene. My impression is that there are many who wished that the ""Empire of the Sun"" version were made instead, desiring a more ""deep and meaningful or artistic"" movie, but for many, having only seen a few of what appear to be foreboding and dark themed cels, we are glad that it evolved into ENG instead. It is disappointing that Disney feels that it should shun this movie, in word and deed. Considering some of the junk that Disney had put out in the same time frame, the lack of available merchandising or exposure only serves to accent Disney's inexplicable self-directed sense of failure for this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of Disney's best (and most underrated) features,"Every Disney movie has funny moments. But not many are funny nonstop.

This movie grooves like no other!,"""Emperor's New Groove"" is one of the funniest movies I've seen in some time, which is especially surprising considering it seemed impossible for it to be good given the clumsy concept and horrible title.  Disney scrapped the singing animals for once and just went for outright laughs, and they scored big in this tale of an emperor with an attitude that gets taken down a peg when he gets changed into a llama.Casting Patrick Warburton (Puddy from Seinfeld) as the Cronk, the lackey to Ertha Kitt's Yzma was sheer genius...if it was possible to receive an academy award for voice work in an animated feature, he'd have it locked up.  Though truly all of the voices are perfect in this movie, and it really does add so much to it.  I know that it hasn't been as successful at the box office as some of the other recent Disney films, and that's a shame, because it deserves more recognition.

I chalk this up to allowing the characters to BE characters instead of caricatures of characters.The actors and actresses timing is *perfect* and even when the whole thing gets silly (which it does, in a good way), the characterizations hold-up.As I write this, years after the movie's release, my kids and I can (and do) still occasionally find reasons to quote some of the lines.This is one of those ""go-to"" movies when everyone's bored and you just need something fun to watch. It doesn't get ultra-sappy, it won't make you laugh until you cry, nobody has to fall in love with anyone and nobody has to die a horrible, unjust death. There isn't even a tragic death we sing about. So it's funny,clever, moves-along pretty well, has a villain who is . . . more believable than they were meant to be I'm afraid. . . has clever dialogue and is well-voice-acted.Kids like it and adults like it. EVEN some teenagers like it. (try that with most animated fair) And for the old guys like me, I get to listen to Tom Jones (entertaining theme) and Sting to boot (the soundtrack has some good stuff on it, not necessarily from the movie).If you won't *listen* and pay attention, then forget everything I've written; but buy or rent it for those you love who will. I'd say it's suitable for everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Instant classic,"When I saw the trailer on the VHS tapes for other Disney movies I was a bit skeptical. Then at the age of 8 it went on TV and I thought of giving it a chance...and that was a great idea. The story itself is nice and easy enough to follow and had a great dose of great Disney comedy (before Disney went complete *beep* with it's terrible sitcoms). The characters are not just characters, they have great personalities even if Kuzco is a bit of a dick in the beginning. The characters are also excellently voiced.This movie became an instant classic to me when I saw it even though it is still one of the shorter Disney movies (77 minutes). If you find this for a decent enough price or in a bargain bin, I recommend you to pick it up.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
I LOVE THIS MOVIE,"I'm not going to go into to much detail as to why I love this movie so much because most of it has already been said so eloquently by others already.  I will reiterate however, that is movie is hilarious and way underrated.  I LOVE Eartha Kitt (brilliance) and Patrick Warburton as Yzma and Kronk, and David Spade is hilarious in this movie as well (the spinach puffs dinner scene and the diner scene, could they  have been more hilarious?)  John Goodman is excellent.  In fact the entire voice cast is excellent.  The humour is silly, kooky, absurd fun.  I'm SO glad it wasn't an over moralizing musical.  This one was meant just for lighthearted laugh out loud entertainment, and it works.I own the single disc DVD and plan on purchasing the 2 disc DVD tomorrow!Seems like all the people who *don't* like it feel that way simply because they don't like David Spade, so they take it out on the whole movie, but then, he's the main character so it's gonna make it hard anyway, (it also helps if you like Bugs Bunny and Daffy duck cartoons)They are missing out....Beware the grooooove!!!!!!",,Anonymous,Animation

Groovy!,"Disney has a way with animated motion pictures.  No matter what the form, no matter what the subject, no matter what the genre, they still manage to make very good animated movies.  And THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE is no exception.The kids will love it.  The film has characters that are lovable, villains that aren't that scary, and a story that is easy to follow.   Both entertaining and exciting, it has everything the kiddies will love.The teen to 20's crowd will love it, too.  All the wisecracks and zany in-jokes, the fun and adventure will make this one quite a scream for a young audience looking for a good time.I do feel, however, that an older crowd might be put off by it.  Lots of times the jokes come in at very fast paces and are sometimes hard to pick up on at first glance.  The plot also gets choppy in places.  And a lot of the humor is aimed at the younger audience, thought not too young, but the grandparents in the audience might get bored or confused by it.  Parents may find them amusing, but the only people I heard laughing the whole time were the teens to 20's.You know when you leave the theatre and are still reciting the dialogue and jokes from the movie that you had fun watching it.  And you know the film was good.  And THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE is just that.It was simple, it was smart, it was funny, and above all, it was a good time.",,Anonymous,Animation
Not Disney's best.,"While I certainly enjoyed `Emperor's New Groove' there was something lacking  This was not one of Disney's best.I loved John Goodman, Patrick Warburton and Wendie Malick's character voices  and they fit the animated roles perfectly  but for some reason the two most important voices Kuzco/Kuzco Llama (David Spade) and Yzma (Eartha Kitt) just didn't work In fact, they became irritating long before the hour and 18 minutes of this film was over.There is a lot to like in this film  though it does seem, at times, to be leftover footage from `The Road to El Dorado.'The colours are challenging, the character animation is blocky and the sound track is not what I expected; Sting doesn't really get a song until the final credits  long after the audience has left the theater.I was really hoping for more and I didn't get it.I like `The Road to El Dorado' and while `Emperor's New Groove' is definitely in that vein, Disney just isn't doing what it does best  entertain.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Not Disney's best,"This is definitely not one of Disney's best efforts. The animation is average at best. The voice characters don't fit the actors in my mind should've been recast. The story is very formulaic and predictable. All the characters are cliché with no depth and really no emotion behind the entire endeavor. Overall, it was an average movie at best. I don't think I laughed or smiled once during the purported jokes. Some of it may be related to the fact that the movie is now almost 25 years old, but I think even then it was definitely a misfire.

"Not just one of the funniest Disney films, but one of the funniest movies of all time","Talk about one laugh after another. Few films, particularly family films, in the past few years have come off as funny to me as ""The Emperor's New Groove."" Emperor Kuzco (voiced by David Spade, excellent) is a selfish ruler turned into a llama by a former employee after firing her. That's a funny enough concept on its own, but its simply the over-the-top, ridiculous characters that make this as hilarious as it is. Kuzco's overly selfish nature, such as him scribbling out characters on the screen so we can focus on him, is simply hilarious. Yzma (Eartha Kitt) and her assistant Kronk, simply hysterical as a childlike supporting character that steals every scene he is in, are both great. There are just too many laughs in this film to describe in a review, and not a single one of them deserves to be spoiled here. I'll just tell you to see it now. Your whole family can enjoy it and laugh and laugh. Not quite perfect, because of a few annoying scenes, particularly with Pacha's (John Goodman) kids and a few poor attempts at humor here. Despite that, it's a very, very funny movie. One of Disney's best, and simply one of the most hilarious films I have ever watched.***1/2 out of ****",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
almost Shakespeare,Haha I have two words for you guys: Kronk. He is definitely by far the funniest person in the movie The Emperor's New Groove by Disney. I like how he is voiced by Joe from family guy. It's nice to see Patrick Warburton doing another voice for an animated character because it feels like he NEVER does that. My favorite part is when Kronk is trying to dispose of the body of the supposed recently deceased Kuzco because his boss wants him to (who hasn't been there right guys? ROFL) but he does the stereotypical angel devil shoulder thing. I also like that John Goodman is in it because who doesn't love John Goodman? He's a national treasure (tm).

How many of you don't show a sign of friendship with a friend? Thought so. And then this is Kusco's probably first friend EVER. So its special for him. Then when I see the movie (especially the ending) Kusco probably sees Pacha as the father he never had and Pacha's family as HIS family. Kusco COULD pass for Pacha's young adult son.

Top Tier Wit,"Boom baby! Hands down, The Emperor's New Groove has the best dialogue of any Disney animated film and it's not even close. Every single line is either hilariously witty or a double entendre, oftentimes both.While the storyline sometimes feels spontaneously thrown together, the film embraces those moments (i.e., how Yzma and Kronk made it back to the palace). The film feels like a continual improv piece which is rare in the animated sphere.This film came at just the right time and is a bright light of hope after the disastrous previous two films by the studio.

This is a joke...right?,"The previews warned me to ""keep away, this is going to be 100% NOT Disney"". You cant possibly get me to believe that the people who made this film had fun doing it, they went through hell...the whole story went through hell. Why? I guess cause they wanted to do a Disney film set in Latin America and they didn't want to count ""Saludos Amigos"" or ""Three Cabelleros""So it's funny to hear how positive the creators made working on the film sounds. ""Oh this originally started out as a serious more Disney like musical called 'Kingdom of the Sun' but we scratched that."" Of course this was the beginning of the original stories era. In a way it's a good thing that they didn't do Kingdom of the Sun (cuz I tire of the ""Prince and the Pauper"" adaptations done by Disney) but I'm sure they couldve come up with a better Latin American story that wouldve worked for Disney.What people, especially critics, fail to understand is that Disney films in the past have worked so well because there is an even balance of comedy, story, and drama. TENG was too much comedy and hardly the rest. Indeed they did Chuck Jones humor but let's be logical...why in the world would a Disney film want to pay tribute to one of its biggest animated rivals? In the future, shall we expect a Don Bluth tribute despite that fact that he walked out and kicked Disney in the butt when he made several animated hits in the 1980s?So my point here is that there was no way you could consider this a Disney movie, while I considered this the marking point: the beginning of Disney's downfall which continues today. It's a very small cast but I supposed that they are all that's needed to get the job done. I don't like animated buddy comedies for some reason (Toy Story and Monsters Inc was good) I think that what made the buddy comedy idea fail for this was Pacha. God, he was so annoying! I think more audiences would relate more with Kuzco, a self centered person who has an odd way of showing his softer side.Well if I ever really really consider buying the DVD (which I doubt) then I would definitely have to check out the making of junk just so I can see the sweat hidden behind the creators smiling faces. All in all I would put this film in the lower half of the pack because this just doesn't contemplate what made a Disney film a Disney film.

"This Emperor Has Clothes, and Moves, and Style...","When you've been reviewing movies for a little while, you start to develop a few verbal symptoms, one of them is to adopt a sort of historian pose. I'll refrain from my usual impulses but just for a bit of contextualization, let's drop some information you're probably aware of. We know the ""Disney Renaissance"" is said to have started in 1989 with ""Little Mermaid"" and ended ten years later with ""Tarzan"". 1999 was also the year of the last Pixar acclaimed movie: ""Toy Story 2"" before Disney would strike again in 2003 with ""Finding Nemo"".What we've got in between is a forgettable trend of direct-to-VHS (or DVD) sequels that spoiled the 'classic' status of movies we tended for classics, and a few movies that have sunk into oblivion in the sense that they are not as celebrated as others involving a cute clown-fish, a cooking rat and a flying house. Speaking for myself, I started to be a student in 2000 and I didn't really care about the new Disney movies, I didn't care for ""Dinosaurs"", ""Atlantis"" and I certainly didn't care for ""Emperor's New Groove"" and it's not like the film didn't have publicity. After 17 years, I can only say ""Mea Culpa"". I was misinformed.I finally saw the film and I must say I've never laughed as much as I did since I saw the ""South Park"" movie, the movie made me laugh to tears, and I mean tears. ""Kuzco"" is one hilarious movie that should be more known on the sole basis of this achievement. But that's why I needed to contextualize the film, it was perhaps made at the worst possible timing, where a new generation of animators was still trying to find the right path, a revolutionary time that saw the change from VHS to DVD, from hand-drawn to computer-generated imagery. More than that, it was a time where Disney had probably used up all the classic fairy tale material, that forged its legend for seventy decades.And in ""Kuzco"", there's no room for grandstanding themes, underdog heroes and heroines, Aesopian arcs and honorable quests, the hero or let's just call him a protagonist is a wise-cracking emperor so wrapped up in the confidence over his power that he ends up being transformed into a llama. But even that pitch might give you the wrong idea, I could also tell you that the Incan emperor has an ego the size of his gigantic palace and would never tolerate anyone ruining his projects and that his journey will allow him to discover the 'good' side of his personality, but even that would be too moralizing for a movie that is mostly made for laughs, and that's why I loved it.I won't spoil the gags but this is a guy who throws an old man from the window because he ""ruined his groove"" or is about to kick a man with two kids and a pregnant village just to build a residential home, named Kuzcotopia. He's not even good by 'antiheroic' standards. And when the ""evil"" counselor Izma is fired because she's abusing from her position, you're still wondering why you should deem her as the villain. But you know what, let's take all these trademark concepts, these ""hero"", ""villain"", ""quest"", ""journey"", ""sidekick"" and throw them in the trashcan of our preconceived notions. This is a bowl of fresh air, finally an animated Disney movie designed as nothing else but a cartoon, it's exactly like ""Aladdin"" and ""Hercules"" without the fancy looking, sappy and romantic elements.To tell you how much I enjoyed the film, let's say that I had the feeling I was watching my good old Cartoon Network programs, ""Cow and Chicken"", ""Johnny Bravo"", even the old Looney Tunes and Tex Avery cartoons. In fact, there are even moments where the film channel some Chuck Jones vibes and the sights remind of the Road Runner. By being the less Disney-esque of all the Disney films, ""Kuzco"" is an oddity that elevates itself above all the other movies, and that might include the classics. Indirectly, it even mirrors the boring pompousness of other well-polished, well- designed, well-crafted movies, that made it at the Top 10 box office at the the end of the year. ""Kuzco"" didn't (""Dinosaurs"" did) but it makes its discovery all the more enjoyable.And I liked it, I loved it. It's a harmless, lighthearted, fun movie, I could say ""little"" but no, it's a masterpiece of laughs. And it's full of great and fun characters, four were enough to make the film, Kuzco the Emperor turned-llama and wise-ass-turned-good- guy, voiced by David Spade, the big and good-hearted Pacha who helps him in exchange of his promise to spare the village, but who actually can't prevent himself from doing a good thing, he's a Good Man played by the namesake John, and by the size, it was guessable. There's finally Yzma who's like a zanier version of Cruella De Vil (EarthaKitt) and her sidekick Kronk (Patrick Warburton) a mountain of a man but with a soft side, I mean can you make more gentle than someone who cooking and can speak the squirrel?I love a movie where you don't expect a villain to fall to death (well, there's a falling but it's an excuse for a hilarious twist), where action is more than an excuse for a succession of gags and laughs, where the 'serious' moments don't last too long, the film is a package of gags with the right running time, less than eighty minutes, but enough to leave you with a smile in your face. This is a film I would recommend to anybody, it's great and deserves more recognition.And take it from someone who hates to use the word ""underrated' but to call it underrated is an overstatement.

"Squeakin' hilarious (yeah, that's the best I can do)","It is actually quite rare for a Disney animation to be hilarious. It is even more rare that such a film should be hilarious even with the sound turned off. The animation here, though, proves an extremely welcome exception.Another part of the film's appeal is its constant gimmickry with its narrative. The action is often interrupted by the narrator for various reasons, and the film has little respect for logic (which might annoy but doesn't - far from it). The mere fact that they have used voice-over is refreshing, but that they have used it in a refreshing way is that even more.I did not know that Spade played the titular character, so I cringed immediately when I heard his voice, for I don't regard him quite as highly as some do. However, my fears proved pointless as he proved himself well-cast with his well-suited voice. Goodman is always dependable, whether it be voicing or not, and the rest are equally fine. Nonetheless, Warburton is a gem, the gem here, I dare say, and given the right role, can do miracles. Hell, he doesn't even need good material to make me laugh, but here he is perfectly cast as Kronk.The screen-writer David Reynolds seems to have some TV sketch comedy to his credit, and it shows - in a positive way. The script is energetic, witty, very silly and full of hilarious dialogue, random moments and clever reuse of its earlier elements. Also, the film's relative brevity is a pro, not a con. Concise, constant hilarity.I am very, very pleased with the fact that they changed the initial nature of the film. If they hadn't turned this into a comedy, said (very broad) genre wouldn't have seen one of its funniest representatives I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. It looks like I am going to have to buy this one. Did I already say it's hilarious? (Oh look, how clever of me - and how inarticulate.)---December 8, 2005I recently saw this for the second time and found it a bit less hilarious, although I still agree with much of the above. In particular I thought the emperor should've been slightly different and that Spade shouldn't have been cast after all. I would have found the character more satisfying had his dialogue not been so laden with this rather annoying teenage lingo, that is, had he not been one to eagerly use this rather annoying teenage lingo. Yes, he's supposed to be an irritating (muffin), but he could've been a more intelligent, more bored, more cynical, irritating (muffin). Imagine, say, the late George Sanders uttering his lines...Well, I ain't the filmmaker here. Despite the ever-visible Disney boundaries the whole is still a good one, which can't be said about, say, the above comment. I mean look at the bloody summary.",,Anonymous,Animation

Not a Classic But It's Entertaining,"The Emperor's New Groove (2000)*** (out of 4)Emperor Kuzco is an annoying, mean and self-centered jerk who fires the wrong old lady because she turns around with the help of a brain dead assistant and turns the Emperor into a llama. Soon the llama is in the forest with his only help coming from Pacha, a man was told by the Emperor that his home was going to be destroyed for a new resort.If you're coming to this Disney movie expecting one of their classics then you're going to walk away disappointed. Disney has built up such a strong reputation and have delivered so many terrific films that whenever they release just a good one, it's hard for that film to really stand out. That's pretty much what happened to THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE because it's a nice little time-killer but at the same time it's certainly not one of the studios best movies.There are a few issues here but the biggest is that there's just nothing here that really stands out or becomes classics. Everything here is good but nothing is great if you will. I think the weakest aspect is the story itself because it's just a bit too predictable for its own good as you know what's going to end up happening in the end. With that said, the majority of the characters are extremely likable with Pacha (voiced by John Goodman) and Kronk (voiced by Patrick Warburton) really standing out. The evil Yzma makes for a good villain but it's hard to ""love to hate her"" because the Emperor himself is so annoying and ugly that you really can't hate or dislike the villain for trying to knock him off.The film, as you'd expect, features some terrific animation and there's no doubt that the music score is a winner too. THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE isn't a masterpiece but as long as you don't go into the film expecting one you should find this to be a decent time-killer.",,Anonymous,Animation
Nearly Perfect Film!,"Perfect cast, pacing, music, animation, humor.

Funniest and most creative movie I have ever seen!,"""The Emperor's New Groove"" is all of funny, creative, touching, interesting, and a good family film.  Every minute that you spend watching this you will burst out laughing.  I have seen this movie like 10 times or so and I laugh every time because the lines are so funny.  ""Emperor Kuzco"", the snotty and spoiled emperor is so funny.  He acts as any spoiled person would with the way he talks.  The animation is remarkable too.  I really think that this is a great movie that people of any age will like.  Whether your 6 or 60, you'll laugh at least 10 times guaranteed. If you buy the DVD, all of the special features are great too.  This movie really finds a way to make you laugh.  Although the plot may be a little silly in some spots, it is still a great movie.  All of the people that have seen this movie know what I mean.""Patcha"", the poor peasant that is one of the main characters acts just like someone trying to deal with someone like Kuzco.  ""Yzma"" the wicked person that is trying to kill Kuzco is so funny.  Even though she is supposed to be this really bad and evil killer, she still acts like a regular old lady in some parts and creates some of the laughs in this movie.  So if all of this stuff that I am telling you sounds interesting and fun to watch, go see (or in this case, rent) ""The Emperor's New Groove""!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Funniest movie of the year!,"Seriously, folks, this movie was funny! It was most definitely the funniest movie I've seen all year. Funnier, even, than road trip or scary movie. Most people hear disney and cringe. No way would they want to see another horrible animated movie along the lines of pocahontas and the hunchback. Disney hasn't made a good film since the lion king, some people think. Not true! This movie was totally different than any other disney movie. It had a lot of sight gags, combined with enough intelligent jokes to make the perfect combination for kids and adults alike. I think the adults might even enjoy it more than the kids, because they will understand all the jokes. I saw it twice it was so funny. There were so many good lines in that movie, I can't even remember them all. David Spade was perfectly cast, as was everyone else in that film.

I only wish there was more of the movie to see. You have to love Kronks clueless good nature and Kuzco's egotistical personality. Love it. If you think this is just a movie for kids, give it a chance. If you don't like the plot, you'll definitely at least laugh.

Action and weak characters,"I'm not a fan of Disney's and I do not think this one is a major picture. Emperor Kuzco switches from selfish disdain to a more friendly position in a wink. Pacha is a dull peasant standing for morals as the perfect American father (and quite henpecked too). Yzma is ugly but not so powerful a villain. Thinking that Disney's are for under 12, I can't see the point for children in watching a picture where good and evil are so weakly depicted. Anyway the storyline is stronger for everything coming to action. But it's an usual trap to focus on action and hang loose on characterization. Perhaps children only deserve a bundle of good images with rhythmic action and that's it.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Funniest Disney Animated Classic ever made.....BY FAR,"The funniest Disney movie ever made....by far.Animation isn't as good as Tarzan or Lion King, but the whole story and humor make up for it.

Spade and the guy from Seinfeld do great voice work.  ..And to top it all off, there are no lame musical numbers, no one spontaneously breaks out into song, no overly-sappy Disney Moral lesson.It's the most underrated movie released this year and probably one of the funniest (IMO of course).

ENG has humor on a number of levels, from slapstick for the kids to poking fun at cartoon logic and even a few jokes that made me laugh out loud.

The Emperor's New Groove is strongly crafted. The music is also nice, featuring an original score and some music by Sting...an interesting collaboration that works.

It's all about Spade!,"Am I alone in thinking Disney's ""Tarzan"" was boring?Am I alone in thinking that, actually, all animated Disney films were sub-par since ""The Lion King""?Did I think that the future of Disney was Pixar, and not the animation department? Oh, yes. I did. Guilty.This is Disney's proof that they can still make an amazingly good movie. I am very surprised, though. I understand that the studio has two animation teams, which work on different Disney projects. One of them is far more powerful than the other, with more resources. If that is true, then Disney should promote the team that created ""Emperor"", because, even tough it looks very cheaply made (when compared to Disney's high standards) it is a very entertaining, very good, very groovy film.It's all about Spade, actually. Reprising his role in ""Tommy Boy"", we see the acidic, sarcastic character. He likes to torture everyone around him. He finds in Pacha his ""Tommy"" (if you haven't seen that film, it is highly recommended), a guy who is noble, likeable and sweet (as a matter of fact, both films are very similar, being ""road trips"" in some sort of sense). He, as you might expect, subjects his partner to all kinds of humiliations, until he learns his moral lesson. Pretty simple stuff, but it is handled with heavy doses of humor everywhere. This film succeeds because everything is funny, lighthearted and uncomplicated. Forget Tarzan's luscious scenery, or Hunchback's feeble attempts at humour launched at a mostly depressing scenario. This film is fast, furious and lighthearted. And musical interludes are kept to a minimum, and when used they are very effective. Yes!I loved it. I can only hope Atlantis will be as good as this one. A solid 9 (had it been animated by the ""heavy honchos"" of Disney, the result would have been different... surely for the worst).",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

This is the best Disney has to offer,"At first I looked at the preview's in the theatre and I said to myself that it does not look that great and I have no real interest in seeing it boy was I regretful when I waited and saw it in on video.

This movie is a non stop laugh fest with some of the funniest character since The Little Mermaid.  John Goodman who voices Pacha is so good that he lifts the movie I mean the chemistry between Goodman and Spade is unforgettable ,but I have to say that Cronk  (played by Patrick Wartburn)is so funny I mean there is not one scene in the movie that his Cronk is in that I don't sit there a laugh out loud that's how good Cronks character is. My other favorite character is Izma as a cat it just so funny to sit there and watch this little fur ball trying to beat up Kuzco as a lama and Pacha.

Boom Baby!,"I was skeptical of this movie for a long time before seeing it. I found it interesting how Disney came out with a movie starring an ancient mesoamerican society at the same time that Dreamworks was scoring big with ""The Road to El Dorado"" which is about the Aztecs. I also found it interesting how the animation style was not typical Disney, but matched closer the style used by Dreamworks. Very interesting. Full-length animated movie politics aside, however, I loved the movie. It was really nothing like the Road to El Dorado. I can't really think of a reason why Disney used the Incas as the characters in their movie (except that Dreamworks had used Aztecs) other than they needed an almost omnipotent emperor, and they thought they could use an Incan one.  I found this movie one of the funniest and most enjoyable I've ever seen. The dialogue was excellent, and the humor so much quicker and better than is par for Disney, that it had me in stitches.

One of the best feel good comedies of the year,"Disney's The Emperor's New Groove is one of those family films that anyone can walk in, see it, and feel good afterwards.  Mainly because it's funny, and mostly entertaining.  Story follows a spoiled emperor (David Spade vocals and gives some great charm to the character) who gets his life twisted around when a revenging advisor (Eartha Kitt voices) turns him into a lama (though by accident).  Then the fun begins.  Like The Road to El Dorado (another animated feel good comedy from this years batch), this is a family animated/comedy that isn't in perfection, but it doesn't matter much when it's this enjoyable.

A new direction for Disney,"Lately, Disney movies have been on a downward path. Personally, I've found the vast majority enjoyable (with the glaring exception of ""Pocahontas""), but there is still a marked decrease in quality between, say, ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""Tarzan"". You could see the movies falling into the same old rut over and over and over again.However, ""Emperor's New Groove"" changed all that. Instead of a contrived love story, there's a buddy comedy featuring the hilarious duo of David Spade and John Goodman. Instead of sappy morals (particularly the sappy morals of being yourself and of finding inner beauty), we get hilarious one-liners and laugh-out-loud situations. And instead of the cute comic sidekick, we get doe-eyed characters (particularly the children and the squirrel) with a significant bite. Needless to say, this one had me in stitches.One part of ""Emperor"" as well as the new Disney trend in general that somewhat saddens me, though, is the move away from the musical format. I know I'm somewhat part of a minority, but I've always loved the songs from Disney movies, even if they do seem intrusive. (Actually, I never thought of them as intrusive, really, but I know many people think that.) Disney hasn't put out an honest to goodness musical in quite a while. Although I do agree that not all Disney movies should be musicals, I also hope that they decide not to abandon the format entirely. Disney movies have recently been pretty much the only place for musicals on the big screen, so I would hope that they would continue to give us the great musical moments we've come to expect.But enough of my editorial. ""Emperor's New Groove"" is one of my favorite Disney movies ever and has surpassed ""Aladdin"" as the funniest Disney movie in my mind. So sit back, relax, and forget anything else Disney's ever done. This, I hope, is a sample of the future.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great comedy and thoroughly entertaining,"I enjoy most of Disney's movies, but this one in particular has so much character.  David Spade's character voice for the Emperor is excellent and could be the main reason why I enjoyed this movie so much.  Anyone who enjoyed David Spade on Saturday Night Live, or Just Shoot Me should definately see this film.Very fun spirited and is definately a different formula than normal disney films.  The characters didn't feel the need to break out in a song every few minutes.  Not that the music in other disney's films is bad, but it sometimes can be overdone.I highly recommend this movie and am looking forward to owning it on video when it is released.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Most fun I've had with Disney in a while!,"I happen to be of the not uncommon opinion that, with the exception of Tarzan and Mulan, Disney's been kinda slumming lately.  See Dinosaur (which I saw back when it was called ""The Land Before Time""), Hunchback, Pocahontas, etc...  But not with this...I. Love. This. Movie.  I went to see it on impulse after my final exam of the fall semester and it was the greatest thing, I had a blast.  Dragged all my friends the very next day to see it and when I got back home for break I made every one there go see it. This is almost more fun than should be legal for $5 a pop.  All the vocal talents are wonderfully cast, especially Eartha Kitt and David Spade...and the trailer does this film little justice, because it's so much more than what they claim it to be.

"Fun, and becoming a classic","What makes this fun animated romp stand out is the humor. That may sound redundant, but it's one of the funniest animated films ever. The comedy is just top drawer. The evil protagonist is a hilarious Phyllis Diller type, with a hunky brainless boy toy, and the duo are hysterical. The supremely vain and uncaring emperor Cuzco is wonderful, personifying the phrase ""let them eat cake."" John Goodman is a great everyman in Pacha, the simple villager who is a tool of forces way beyond his comprehension, and while the assumption that someone like Cuzco could have been de-Grinchified by an adventure like this is a real stretch, it finally doesn't matter. The movie is so much fun that you just go with it, like a roller coaster. My complaint is that everyone speaks as though they are from 20th century Los Angeles. Nowhere do we get the impression that these are people from another time and place. If it weren't for the costumes, we would have no idea when or where it is. Turn your back and listen to the dialogue without watching the screen, and see very dramatically what I mean.

"""Mazel Tov""","It looks like Disney finally gave up the pretentious tone of their last films. ""The circle of life"" might indeed sound a bit over the top. This time, despite a slightly moralising theme, the crazy plot is nothing more than a great pretext for wacky situations. Unlike the last films where all the sets were almost screaming ""look how artsy this is! look how great our stuff is! look at what I can do!"" here, some great looking sets are present with a discretion that goes to their honour. When Pacha leaves the palace at the beginning of the film and walks back to his village, his route is delightful to the eye, without annoying violins ruining it by desperately trying to point it out.Disney also seems to have given up the ""song every seven minutes"" policy. There's only one song in the film, and that's quite enough. More would brake the groove. The voices are excellent. David Spade has the fake crying and whining that makes him so delightfully annoying in Just Shoot Me. And Patrick Warburton has his serious and brainless tone of voice in the most inappropriate moments. (""He left without paying his check."") This is just to name a couple.Much like Scream, or Austin Powers, in a completely different theme though, the film makes fun of itself. The characters don't expect us to believe the absurd Hollywood-like coincidences of their adventure, and seem to be quite aware of the fact they're only characters of a film. And, in any case, how serious can a Jewish New York diner in the middle of a pre-Columbian South American jungle be? Especially when the waitress expresses her happiness with a ""blasé"" ""Mazel Tov""? How come, in the end of every action film, the ""bad guys"" so often seem to get in the way of the ""good guys"" in the most unlikely of ways? ""Who cares?"" seems to be the general attitude of The Emperor's New Groove.The four main characters follow a seemingly endless series of misadventures, all more unlikely and more hilarious than the other. They spoof other films and parody a lot of situations. There are no tasteless jokes, as there were in The Lion King. They play with stereotypes and attitudes. They achieve a lot by not taking themselves too seriously.That's just the kind of humour I like. I couldn't stop laughing.

Is he hip or what?,"""The Emperor's New Groove"" might be the best Disney movie in years. Although not promoted as one of their major christmas motion pictures, it clearly has everything a good animated movie needs and more. It features non of the typical Disney elements (i.e. 'soft' humor, lots of singing, cute and funny supporting figures etc.) but instead gives us great puns, a lot of self-irony and a plotline that keeps the raised forefinger of moral a bit in the background. Both the style of drawing and the humor reminded me more of recent cartoons like '2 Stupid Dogs' or 'The Simpsons', the gags hit straight in the face and the characters are so exaggerated that they are simply cool.

Hilarious!!,"This movie is wonderful, for kids *and* adults. I laughed so hard I was crying! I won't give anything away, but I'll give a little synopsis. Basically, there is this emperor, Kuzco,  who thinks that he's the only one on the planet that matters and makes sure that everyone else knows this. David Spade is the voice of Kuzco, and I don't think anyone could have done as good a job as he did. John Goodman plays the humble, helpful Pacha whose house might be destroyed because of Cuzco's plans for an attraction called ""Kuzcotopia"". The events that follow are extremely entertaining; even I, who am known to fall asleep during action films, paid close attention.I encourage everyone to go see this film, it is definitely worth the money.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Creative casting makes this work,"Emperor Kusko is inconvenienced when his advisor turns him into a llama, and he needs a villager and his family to help him return to power.  It'd be easier for the villager if the emperor weren't planning to raze the village to make room for a summer home.I don't know what David Spade is like in real life, but voicing the character of Kusko seems to flow very naturally for him.  There's good chemistry between him and John Goodman (Pacha), though at points neither seems terribly involved emotionally.  Whoever thought of casting Eartha Kitt as Yzma was inspired...her voice is absolutely perfect for the evil chemist.  Patrick Warburton also deserves a mention as Yzma's minion, Kronk, one of the most lovable bad guys I've seen in a while.  I liked this movie; perhaps not Disney's best, but I thought it was pretty good.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney's much needed New Groove!,"""New Groove"" was the best Disney movie I've seen since the Lion King, yet lacked everything that The Lion King had!  The Lion King had all the makings of the stereotypical Disney Animated feature, music, characters bursting into song every 10 minutes, lessons to be learned, insanely evil villains who inevitably are killed at the end by the tragic hero, Love interests, wacky side kicks to add in a little humour along with the drama, and shiney eye candy animation. Yet, along with all this, Lion King had the love put into it that made it the wonderful movie that it was.  All the Disneys after it had all the components but the Love!Not that ""New Groove"" didn't have some of the qualities aforementioned, it had music (But not sung by the characters), it had a lesson to be learned, and it had eye candy animation (But who says that's a bad thing if the heart is in the right place?)... everything else had a groove of it's own. Disney certainly got a  New Groove going when they came up with this movie!  It's unlike any other Disney I've seen. It was a laugh a minute for me.  I must have missed every other joke in it because I was laughing so hard at the joke before it!  David Spade was absolutely hilarious!Though it's plot was thin and predictable, the movie still possessed the charm and lovable characters that we've not seen in a long time.  It rings of The Great Mouse Detective, with it's charming and lovable characters and alot of slap stick comedy to leave you laughing, not sobbing (Lion King, remeber Mufasa's death?)!I am very surprised to see how many people didn't like this movie as much as I did.  I feel that Disney's New Groove is promising for future animated features, and I hope to see more movies like this in the future.Oh, and if you're wondering WHY it was called ""New Groove"" and there's not much singing in it... well, it's because the Emperor's Old Groove was that of his selfish and spoiled self, and after he met Pacha... well, it changed it Groove.  (There's also that whole... Llama thing.)",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A movie full of swinging and falling but also heart,"Rating-8/10The Emperor's New Groove is a Disney animated movie about Kuzco the little emperor of a vast land and his journey when some certain characters turn against him and well, turn him into a llama. It's full of heart this movie but also importantly fun too, sure Kuzco and David Spade who voices him can get annoying but it's really the other characters in this movie you have to love. This is one of the best received Disney films of the early 2000's and no wonder why, it's unique and feels fresh amongst the crowd of Disney made animations.The film goes along at a nice pace, not too fast but not too slow and for it's running time of only 78 minutes, it manages to get in everything it needs. Kuzco as mentioned is our main man and his adventure is pretty fun, add in the stupidly funny character of Kronk(Patrick Warburton), the power mad Yzma(Eartha Kitt) and the humblest of them all, peasant Pacha(John Goodman) and you have yourself one hell of a story. It starts and ends very nicely and could possibly get better and better as it goes on, just good fun and not just for the kids either.I loved the design and animated location of this movie, set in the old style kingdoms of Incan times it just bursts with colour and contains beautifully created sets and really can at times make you admire it. I think it was a gamble for Disney to go with what they went with though, luckily the story is interesting because if not, the film would be all show and no actual heart to it, but this movie has both in abundance.I said about Kuzco being kind of annoying and I do find David Spade a kind of, little annoyance in this movie, the only member of the cast I disliked really. Although I say what I say, Spade is still not bad and it would be too mean of me to criticise how he sounds, it's Kuzco himself who is big headed but I do think where he lies best is when he is in scenes with Pacha and John Goodman's booming but also kind of calm voice. You'll come to like certain characters but for me Kronk is by far the highlight, very dumb but hilarious and because of it he provides the majority if not nearly all laughs, a well placed move from Disney.Mark Dindal directs OK and David Reynolds writes at the same level, Dindal works best in the more action packed moments full of running and swinging and the such where as Reynolds only really works well in the funniest of moments and especially with good old Kronk. I felt this movie had a surprising amount of depth to it, even at times powerful emotion, Pacha the kind peasant is a beautifully created character and provides the complete opposite kind of outlook than that of Kuzco, again a well played move from the people behind this but also that this film is more than comedy.I think the Emperors New Groove is a fine movie and one I couldn't recommend more, and that's to adults and children as this movie is not so childish and actually can be funny. Sweet short and a lovely little tale, this is one film I can see many who haven't already seen it liking and maybe who knows, loving it.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Renting this movie, I had my doubts (MANY doubts) about Disney's animated feature The Emperor's New Groove. And as I watched kids tugging their parents' arms -- parents whose attitudes seemed not too detache","Another Disney movie, another cartoon... just how good was this going to be? While I enjoyed The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin, the idea of a completely made-up story starring a hit-or-miss David Spade didn't appeal too much to me. But as it turns out -- and MUCH to my delight -- I think I may have found, if nothing else, one of the single funniest movies out there -- no joke! Read ahead, and I'll explain the method to my madness. Emperor Kuzco (Spade) is a spoiled-rotten, overgrown brat of a dictator who has everything he could ever want and everyone at his beck and call. But there are those bent on thwarting his lap-o'-luxury lifestyle -- in particular, Yzma and her no-brain-all-brawn servant, Kronk. Yzma and Kronk conspire to poison Kuzco and take over the empire, but their plan slightly backfires when the diluted poison merely changes Kuzco into a llama (not exactly ""dead"", but then I don't know how being a llama feels). Kuzco is thrown out of the city, befriends a not-too-trusting peasant named Pacha (John Goodman) -- himself a victim of the former Emperor Kuzco's plans for a summer house (complete with waterslide) where Pacha's home stands -- and with a little help, attempts to change himself back into human form and regain his throne. New Groove, I'm convinced, is only a Disney movie in name. It comes off, more times than not, like an extended episode of the WB's Animaniacs -- but this is a good thing. Spade, drenched with sarcasm, delivers an oft-times hysterical performance; Kitt should have done this voice-over gig a long, long time ago in a role that I doubt few could have fulfilled as perfectly as she did; Goodman is much more subdued as Pacha, but it makes for a nice balance with Spade; even Wendie Malick as Pacha's wife, Chicha, gets into the fun with a few zingers herself. But... the real star here, in a part absolutely tailor-made for him, is Warburton. In a role that could have been just another henchman, Warburton transforms Kronk into the ultimate object of clueless likeability (a la David Puddy -- Elaine's on-again-off-again boyfriend on Seinfeld). Some of the funniest scenes -- and I was practically doubled-over at times -- are Kronk's arguments with his alter egos, the classic angel/devil shoulder buddies. Warburton puts a whole new spin on the ""act"". And this is not a plug for Disney, but please do make the effort to see this movie. While it probably won't go down as a ""classic"", it's sure to tickle even the most hard to find funny bones. Oh... and did I mention that the kids will have a lot of fun, too?",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

The plot is bizarre and so are the characters and there are, of course, obvious 20th century elements, but if you ignore all that or just except it you will have a lot of fun. This movie is just filled with jokes and sight gags and unlike most animated movies it doesn't slow down much at all and the tone of the movie stays very light throughout. The movie never gets unpleasant or bogged down with drama that has ruined other animated features. This movie is hilarious, light and short and if you can't enjoy it you've got a problem.This movie probably deserves a 6 or 7, but I give it an 8 because it is so funny and enjoyable and it has the added quality that you feel better after you watch it than you did before.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Underrated master piece,"This is honestly one of the best animated movies of all time, and might as well admit that I gave it a 10 - i.e. way above the 7.3 average it currently ranks at.I have seen it multiple times on DVD, and loved it every time. The animation style is not typical Disney (perhaps closest to the boring Pocahonta), but it suits the Aztec-theme.The pace and the humour is tremendous and the characters are hilarious, especially the self centred Emperor Kuzco and the evil Yzma's sidekick, Kronk.Kids may enjoy it because of the tempo and the action scenes, but I would say that this is a movie aimed at adults, with several absolutely perfect scenes such as ""the one at the no-llama diner"", the grand finale and not least the ""tied to the log scene"":Pacha: Uh oh.Kuzco: Don't tell me: We're about to go over a huge waterfall.Pacha: Yep.Kuzco: Sharp rocks at the bottom?Pacha: Most likely.Kuzco: Bring it on.It does not come much better than this.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Is This the Movie to Watch?,"This is a quick short summary and opinion of The Emperor's Groove. The Emperor's Groove is a story based on a pharaoh who takes granted of all of the stuff he has and he thinks he is the best in the world. Then things start to get fired up, The pharaoh fired his assistant and she needs revenge. The pharaoh's used to be assistant tries to poison the pharaoh but instead she actually turns him into a lama. Then a poor village leader helps the pharaoh, but he is mad at the pharaoh because he is going to destroy the village the guy lives in.In opinion The Emperor's Groove is a well rounded movie and is great to watch as a family. If this movie had a rating of 1 to 5 I would give it a 5, because it is meant for families with children who enjoy watching movies with their parents. There are a lot of funny parts to this movie, there is nothing inappropriate in this movie and is perfect for children. This movie's story is really creative and fun to watch even for me! This movie is nice to watch with family or just yourself. Hope this review helps you chose the next perfect movie for your family.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

There are so many really funny things in this film that I laugh out loud every few minutes every time I watch it.

The Best in Years,"This is the funniest movie in years.  I am not talking about just Disney movies, in general, this movie is all out hilarious.  Patrick Warburton steals every scene he's in as Kronk, the incompetent sidekick.  This movie had me in stitches from the very opening all the way to the end.  Unlike most comedies nowadays, this one is appropriate for the entire family. Disney has returned to their old form with this one.  While it lacks the musical prowess of such Disney heavyweights like ""Aladdin"" and ""The Lion King"" the writing in it is top notch, and the actors do a splendid job at portraying these incredibly funny characters.  This is one you can bring the kids to if you want, but it's just as enjoyable by yourself, or even on a date.  Everyone will love this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Post - Modern Disney,"Another clever attempt at adult entertainment from the post - modernist Disneys. I really wish Eisner should ok more stuff like this. This has the same amount of nods and winks towards the adult audience as ""Aladdin"" and ""Hercules"" (both movies who really were directly geared towards the more mature market) but this one has David Spade instead of Robin Williams, making it probably a tad more edgy. Plenty of in-jokes, references to previous Disney stuff and loads of clever oneliners makes this the second best of the modern Disney movies after ""Aladdin"". 7/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A fresh breath of difference,"Most of Disney's animated films of late have been so formulaic as to make me sick.  They contain the obligatory song segments, a couple of comic relief characters, the same style, similar plot devices, and usually one featured song in the middle of it all that plays in toto while some animated music video plays across the screen.  Toy Story was a departure from this formula (and it was great) and The Emperor's New Groove is different too.  The humor is of a different ilk than previous Disney films, that I would characterize as slightly bizzare.  And partly for this reason I really enjoyed this movie.  I liked the characters Pacha, voiced by John Goodman, and Kronk, who though he plays on the team of the villain is very likeable.  I usually watch these movies for the benefit of children but it is nice when I can enjoy one as much as they do.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Groovy!,"I always thought this movie slipped under the radar - certainly not normally mentioned in the canon of Disney Greats, like The Little Mermaid, Beauty & The Beast, The Lion King, etc.The Empereror's New Groove is therefore a delightful surprise - beautifully animated, well paced and with a generous dollop of genuinely funny moments. David Spade is terrific as the spoilt, arrogant Kuzco, while Eartha Kitt hams it up nicely as Ysma, the evil aid (kind of like a very thin Ursula, from The Little Mermaid).As other reviewers have mentioned, the humour is appealing to adults, without resorting to crude innuendos.If you've not seen this, you and your kids will love it!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney Knows how to Groove!,"I was lucky enough to attend a preview screening in London at the weekend. It gave me the feeling The Emperor's New Groove will be one of the most understated Disney movies released in recent years. Of course, I'm saying this before the film's US opening and before the hype train pulls into Britain in February. I only hope that it gets what it deserves: A lot of credit.The story of a spoilt Emperor who is turned into a Lama by his scheming adviser is the stuff that Disney movies are made of. But this is not a philosophical  or moral piece with moments of comedy. This is a roller-coaster of laughs that I haven't seen since the likes of Aladdin. The animation is sharp and colourful. Definitely up to scratch.When the movie's over, as the kiddies munch into their Emperor's New Groove Happy Meal with wind up Lama, Mum and Dad will feel like they've got their money's worth. There is so much in this for adults. David Spade and John Goodman prove once again that Disney producers have an ear for voice talent. They make a great comedy duo.  The fact that their lines were probably recorded weeks apart shows how good these performers (and editors) are. With so many one-liners and quips, I wonder how many were improvised.  I'm sure a lot of it will go over younger children's heads, but the eye candy will keep them entertained. So many sight gags are involved, this does need a second viewing.It's great to see a Disney movie so tongue in cheek! Very refreshing, very enjoyable. A modern classic!

"One of Disney's Cleverest and Most Unique Films,","The Emperor's New Groove is a fantastic movie with a really well written storyline and a terrific voice cast. It is a very smart and unexpected turn from Disney, every time I watch it I just can't believe they ever allowed it be made, it's constant use of breaking the fourth wall and adult innuendos surprise me each time. The use of breaking the fourth wall is definitely my favourite part of the movie and is what makes it so fun and unique, it is mostly done by the main character Kuzco, who questions the films premise constantly and pauses it throughout because he is confused whenever he isn't on the screen, this type of thing can be annoying at times in movies, but it works out perfectly here and I never got annoyed. All the characters in this movie are great and likable in their own way, my favourite is Kronk, every line of dialogue by him is memorable and he had me in stitches most of the time. Very funny, smart and a huge risk from Disney that worked out well, the Emperor's New Groove is very enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a film for the whole family to enjoy.After a king is transformed in to a llama by an evil woman looking to take his place on the throne, he must get the help of a friendly village man in order to turn back to normal.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Played Strictly for Laughs, and It Works","It is a treat to watch a movie that does not take itself at all seriously and works. In The Emperor's New Groove, Disney goes for laughs pretty much on every frame and achieves its goal. This is a fast paced and funny film with a unique animation style and lots and lots of laughs.David Spade pays Kuzco, a bratty spoiled Emperor who thinks he is beloved, but is hated by just about everyone. John Goodman co-stars as Pacha, the lovable peasant who discovers that the Emperor is plotting to destroy his home to build a summer Villa. Kzco is being plotted against by Izma (Eartha Kitt is a bit of genius casting) and her dim-witted sidekick Gronk, whose attempt to poison him turns the Emperor into a Llama.From there, the movie is a buddy adventure as the unlikely pair of Pacha and Kuzco try to find there way back to the palace and restore Kuzco to the throne.The laughs abound. In the movie's best scene, the four leads are all in a restaurant ordering lunch and going unnoticed to eachother. It displays perfect comic timing, and even a very subtle tribute to Five Easy Pieces.The best thing about this movie is the voice-over work of Patrick Warburton as Gronk. As the loyal and dense side-kick, he plays that standard Disney role of the villain with a conscience, this time, quite literally. Gronk wants to be a servant and a chef, but we also find out he can dance, clean and speak fluent squirrel.This is not Disney's most artistic accomplishment, nor its greatest feat of creativity.

The vocal cast makes this movie an A+,"What would ""The Emperor's New Groove"" be without David Spade, John Goodman, Eartha Kitt and Patrick Warburton? Not much of a movie. This is probably the best vocal ensemble a Disney animated movie has seen in a long time. They bring the movie to a level rarely achieved with their expert vocal talents. Spade makes these noises that become perfect for the llama Kuzco. Goodman is solid (when is he ever not solid?). Kitt makes her voice downright nasty, perfect for her character. But perhaps the unsung hero of this movie is Warburton as Kronk. Everything the guy says is hysterical, making him easily one of my favorite Disney characters. Other great things about the movie include the animation, done in a angular style that looks really sharp. Also, its not stuffed full of random moments of song. And saving the best for last, there are moments where the movie is not even taking itself seriously that contribute to its humor.

Very groovy indeed.,"Let's be honest: Disney has never really challenged the cliche horizon. Since Aladdin we even haven't been treated to non-digital brilliance anymore. Well, it seems with the competition (read: Dreamworks) leering around the corner Disney is upping the ante. David Spade shows his ultimate performance like Williams once did for that cooky blue genie. As the arrogant, sarcastic lama he steals the show and the fact that ancient Peru is merely used as canvas without depth for once is not a hindrance. The humor is simply too brilliant. Definitely for adults as for kids, this one. Even for people, who would steer away from Disney.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Moral of Humility,"This movie has an important message to it. It shows what can happen to people who forget the important characteristic of humility. Those who puff themselves up will eventually be deflated in some form or another. It is a good movie for kids and adults to watch because both can learn from it. Kuzco underwent a transformation for the better when Pacho was his friend despite Kuzco's arrogance, and was still there for him when Kuzco hit bottom. So in a way, it also has an important message regarding friendship as well.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Breath of fresh air,"All I can say is I avoided this film because I am so tired of the same Disney formula. I was more than pleasantly surprised when I finally viewed it.  I went with my boyfriend and his 4 year old son. It may have been above the 4 year old's head, but the point is it was clean and he watched it. I am not quite sure why everyone thinks that every Disney film or film that's geared toward kids has to be solely for children. Let's face it kids stop to stare at commercials.  Everything is new and somewhat confusing to them. It's part of growing up learning to puzzle these things out. Kids need things that are suitable for them true, but adults need things that they can be entertained by and occupy their child as well. Anyone who has kids or are around them know that you will spend a lot of time watching the same Disney movie or cartoon over and over and over and over.  Kids don't get bored with it because it's all new to them. So giving The Emperor's New Groove a poor rating based on the fact that your 4 year old didn't get every joke is inane, asinine, absurd..etc.     I gave this movie a 10 based on the fact that I was highly entertained. Critics need to try rating something based on what it is rather than what it isn't. Movies should either entertain, provoke thought, elicit an emotional response, be awe inspiring, or in some way advance movie making be it through technical machinations or plot devices etc. *see Citizen Kane*. There are few films that have been successful in executing most of that criteria.     Will you laugh and giggle while watching this?...Yes...quite a bit. David Spade, John Goodman, Eartha Kitt, and Seinfeld's Puddy do a wonderful job. If you haven't this yet please do. If you loved Alladin you will appreciate this film.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Good Disney movie, first time I ever saw it and I'm 27!","The movie's story is very simple and to the point, and actually sends a good and moral message. The voice acting was really good and while the main villain was portrayed well and entertaining, I couldn't entirely take her and her ""right hand man"" seriously and their threat toward Emperor Kuzco was mostly played as a joke. There are some slightly better Disney films where the villains were a lot more menacing and dark. However other than that, the film's animation was also well done and it's an easy/simple and quick Disney movie to watch.

Terrific comedy!,"""The Emperor's New Groove"" is a bit different to what Disney had accustomed us so far; well, to tell it is a lot different to that, in fact, it could be said that this animated film is closer to the crazy and brilliant minds of Tex Avery and Chuck Jones than to the classic Disney animated features. Long gone are the musical numbers and the fairy tales, gone are the beautiful heroines and the malevolent villains; this little film is a breath of fresh air that takes Disney to the unexplored terrain of satire, parody and irreverent comedy. And the trip is well worth.The movie is about the young and arrogant Kuzco (David Spade), the Emperor of an Incan nation who enjoys his life of pleasure and comfort without caring too much for his people. Until one night, his second in command, Yzma (Eartha Kitt) betrays him and tries to poison him. Fortunately, the formula only converts Kuzco into a talking llama, however, with him in that form Yzma is able to usurp the power and gets rid of Kuzco. Now, the young Emperor will have to learn to live in a world harsher than what he knew and try to recover his throne.Well, while the plot outline sounds like another one of Disney's dramatic epic adventures, this movie has indeed a new groove. History says, that the film was actually going to go that way but director Mark Dindal and writers Chris Williams and David Reynolds took the story in a completely new direction, making a feature unlike any of the rest of Disney's classics. The film is packed with a very clever sense of humor that can be understood in many levels; it is not only mere slapstick, it goes beyond and as written above, has more in common with the Warner Bros. animations of Chuck Jones' days. The characters are perfectly well-designed and are definitely the soul of the film.However, the departure in content does not mean that the rest has changed. Despite all the apparent irreverence, the movie is suitable for kids and the morals and the message are still there, it's just that the package is now more entertaining than before. The animation technique still has Disney's top notch quality and the beautiful Inca-inspired designs give the film a fresh new look. The tone and mood of the story allows the film to explore many things that Disney had never tried and overall is a new modernization to their style.The cast is amazing and responsible of most of the success of the film. David Spade is brilliant as Kuzco and his domain of the character is total. It's hard to imagine someone else doing the voice. John Goodman plays Pacha, the only man who believes the talking llama is actually Kuzco, and his performance is very good. However, Eartha Kitt as Yzma and Patrick Warburton as her sidekick Kronk steal the show. If Spade and Goodman are brilliant then Kitt and Warburton are simply perfect.The film is definitely among the funniest films ever done by Disney and it is almost flawless. Even when it uses some pop culture references the film doesn't feel dated or silly thanks to the very subtle way that kind of humor is used. Still, the movie has been attacked for deviating from the classic Disney film and while the criticism has some good points (the film's simplicity for example), it still is a memorable and effective film that delivers lots of laughs and pure entertainment.""The Emperor's New Groove"" may not be a landmark of animation such as ""Beauty and the Beast"", but personally I think it represents a breath of fresh air for Disney and one of the most funny animated films ever done. While it is understandable that not everyone will catch the film's humor, this personal favorite is a very recommended film. 9/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good family film,"Good family film. The Emperor's New Groove was cute film, it was drastically different to most of the previous animated feature films from Disney, being mostly focused in the slapstick comedy, something that gives it a similar feeling to the classic Looney Tunes shorts, which at the same time still has some of the classic ""Disney magic"".The result is something very enjoyable to watch, having likable characters, a funny story and many effective gags.Even when the animation from this film isn't so impressive as in masterpieces such as ""The Beauty and the Beast"" or ""The Lion King"", the result is still pretty good, with stylish designs and sceneries, having a different but equally appealing aesthetic than the other movies from the Disney Animated Canon.Definitely a worth-watching experience. ""Home on the Range"" tried to be something similar than this, without achieving the same level of quality of this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"'Emperor's New Groove' a goofy, breezy slapstick cartoon that's easily the funniest Disney movie to date","Emperor's New Groove Emperor Kuzco(voiced by David Spade) is a swinging, cocky Emperor who makes the mistake of firing his suspicious adviser, Ezma(voiced by Eartha Kitt) after she tries to run the country behind his back. With the help of her dim-witted right-hand man, Kronk(Patrick Warburton) and her secret lab, Ezma plans to kill Kuzco backfire as he is turned into a llama.So Ezma sends Kronk to finish the job, but he loses Kuzco in a crowd, but he doesn't tell Ezma, so she thinks shes dead. Now with the help of a gentle, supportive llama herder and father, Pacha(John Goodman), they embark on a journey to get Kuzco back to the Palace, while Ezma and Kronk go on a journey to find Kuzco and kill him...The Emperor's New Groove may not be the most memorable Disney movie, but it's certainly the funniest.I don't think I've laughed so hard at the movie theatre in a long time. The plot of the film is an excuse to string together clever one-liners, goofy slapstick and sprightly chase sequences, and in this type of film, that's OK.

Disney's are showing some groove,"""The Emperor's New Groove"" is an unusual Disney feature, but that's the refreshing thing about it. Originally (for those who didn't knew) it was planned to be a epic drama, with Roger Allers (""Lion King"") as the director. That were one of the reasons that I looked forward too ""The emperor's new Groove"", who was originally called ""Kingdom of the sun"". But then the project took another direction, with it's understandable in some ways (and it's a looong story, trust me). If they made the right decision is another discussion for now, but when you see ""The Emperor's New Groove"", you can't be disappointed.This film is more bizarre than you expect from Disney. It's not a typical Disney feature like for example ""Cinderella"" and ""Tarzan"", but it still is a fresh and enjoyable cartoon. It has more irony and sarcasm and it's nice to see a Disney cartoon that is pure comedy. While the plot is simple, the script is well-written and hilarious. The score from John Debney is most of the time boisterous, but it actually fits the tone of the movie.The characters are likable/hate-able (here comes something that could be considered as a spoiler): Kuzco and Yzma are both the same kind; self-pity, but still funny. Kronk is one of the funniest characters in the film, the same with the squirrel and Pacha's kids. Pacha's wife is very cute and charming. While Pacha himself is not so funny like the rest of the cast, he's a nice and gentle character that is likable. SPOILERS over. Besides, the voice actors are doing a great job!The animation it self looks more than a Warner Bros cartoon than the regular Disney-style, but it fits the movie. ""The Emperor's New Groove"" is a Disney-feature that you can safely watch many times without getting easily sick of it. Groove on! He he.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
More fun for adults than kids,"Not that the children won't love it, but much, if not most, of the humor is going to go right over their heads.  The movie has a less Disney feel to it, as if halfway through production Disney didn't like how it was going and told them to just finish what they had.  No big musical numbers, no state-of-the-art animation techniques, some of the backgrounds almost look as if they were using the roughs, and many scenes are left out . . . but that was probably the best part of the film.Between all the out-of-character takes, bordering-on-spoof humor, and fill-in-the-blanks missing scenes (one of which even plays an integral part of the plot) it works very well on two levels.  You might even want to catch a late showing by yourself and leave the kids at home.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Monty Python Meets Walt Disney,"The recent spate of animated films from Disney, beginning with `The Little Mermaid', have become the modern-day versions of the Hollywood musical. These Disney films, while sweet, are more or less formulaic in nature - they feature a plucky young hero (usually a heroine), a love interest, a wacky sidekick, and a good half-dozen or so schmaltzy songs from the likes of Elton John or Phil Collins.  While there's nothing wrong to this - `Beauty and the Beast' is a phenomenal film, as is `The Lion King' and `Aladdin' - it is a formula, nonetheless, and as such it leads to certain expectations when watching an animated Disney feature.`The Emperor's New Groove' lives up to none of these expectations.  As it turns out, this is a very, very good thing.  Despite lacking the traditional Disney film structure, `The Emperor's New Groove' is equal parts zany, silly, funny, clever, funny, and witty.  (Did I mention funny?) Apparently, while trying to channel the spirit of Walt Disney for `The Emperor's New Groove', director Mark Dindal and his animation team accidentally channeled the spirit of Tex Avery instead.  The film has a wonderfully absurd sensibility to it, where instead of watering down a simple story to entertain small children, it remains razor sharp, appealing on one level to kids . . . and on a totally different level to adults.  `The Emperor's New Groove', in its own way, is a homage to all those great Warner Brothers of yore created by Michael Maltese and Chuck Jones - as bizarre as it may seem, the classic `Rabbit Season! Duck Season!' cartoon would not be out of place in a film like this.  (Also, there is a squirrel in this film that seems to have literally wandered in from a Droopy Dog cartoon; it certainly possesses the wicked self-awareness of a Tex Avery character).Eschewing the idea that a hero must be likable, `The Emperor's New Groove' focuses, quite naturally, on the Emperor Kuzco (voiced by David Spade), the supreme ruler over a long-ago kingdom (presumably part of the Incan Empire, although that's never clearly stated).  Kuzco, who, much like Spade himself, is sarcasm incarnate, succeeds in annoying two important characters in the first few minutes of the film.  The first is the peasant Pacha (voiced by John Goodman), who is informed by Kuzco that his family's small house is to be demolished so that a pleasure palace called `Kuzcotopia' call be built in its place.  The second is Kuzco's treacherous advisor/sorceress Yzma (voiced by Eartha Kitt), who is pleasantly informed by Kuzco that the kingdom is `downsizing' and that her services are no longer needed.   Pacha takes his bad news with stoic, humble grace; but the evil Yzma decides that in order to save her job and become de facto ruler of the kingdom, she must kill Kuzco.  This being a Disney cartoon, she fails miserably in her assassination attempt, but does manage to magically transform Kuzco into a talking llama.  Kuzco the llama, still sarcastic but no longer omnipotent, finds himself cast out into the wilderness of his kingdom . . . and through a strange series of events, suddenly finds himself relying on the kindhearted, humble Pacha for help.The story's simple, but that's okay, since it's merely an excuse to string together a veritable calvacade of jokes, ranging from broad slapstick to rapier-sharp verbal wit.  The film never overtly tries to tug at the heartstrings of the audience - instead, it usually goes for the quick wisecrack or the funny sight gag, and if a few heartstrings are pulled in the process, well, that's just fine. ""The Emperor's New Groove"" is almost Disney with an attitude, except the attitude is hip, not smug.The jokes - and the film - are amazingly funny, and a large part of this success should be credited to the characters, and to the talented actors who voice them.  By far, the best character in the film is Yzma's dimwitted henchman Kronk (voiced by Patrick Warburton), an affable thug who simply seems too stupid to be evil.  In his first few scenes, Kronk starts out as the typical Disney muscle-bound villain - thickheaded and prone to violence - but the villainy of Kronk slowly fades away as the film progresses, revealing a bizarrely hilarious character with Monty Python sensibilities. Kronk still dutifully follows the wicked Yzma's orders - to a point - but often performs such orders after setting his own priorities in order, such as baking spinach cheese balls or playing double dutch with kids.  It's loopy, but it works, and Kronk really is the lynchpin to this film's humor. John Goodman is also good as Pacha - he lends the film a certain amount of dignity, which is sorely needed, since the Emperor Kuzco isn't exactly a heroic figure.  He also gives the film a subtler layer of humor, as he quietly delivers some funny lines that can go unnoticed if you aren't paying strict attention to the film.  Eartha Kitt is absolutely delicious as the sorceress Yzma.  He plays her part as the ultimate spoiled diva; her character is a tightly wound emotional wreck, reacting to everything in such a sheer over-the-top fashion that it's pure comedy genius.  Ironically, the weakest character may be the Emperor himself - as Kuzco, David Spade and his acid wit are very funny at times, but the character remains abrasive for far too long.  He's almost too much to take at times, especially for kids - and face it; kids will be watching this film.  Toning Spade down a notch or two might have helped to smooth out the film and to make it better overall.Smart, hip, and daring to push the Disney envelope, `The Emperor's New Groove' is an outstanding film.  Adults will love it.  Kids might not get all the jokes, but they'll love it too - after all, `The Emperor's New Groove' is really just part of a zany cartoon tradition that kids have loved for a long, long time.  Just think of Bugs Bunny instead of Mickey Mouse as you put the tape in your VCR, and you and your family should be just fine. It's a very well done film.  Grade: A-",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

A fun Disney Film,"This is one of those rare Disney films that isn't a musical but manage to hold up on it's own against other movies from Disney.The Emperor's New Groove is a comedy animation movie that tells the story of Emperor Kuzco (Voiced by David Spade) after he is turned into a llama by Yzma (Voiced by Eartha Kitt) with her henchman Kronk (Voiced by Patrick Warburton) must seek help from Pacha (Voiced by John Goodman).What makes the film different from other films of Disney is the fact the film breaks the fourth wall now that is not something you have seen too many times in their films but for the plot it actually works and makes it more funny to.The animation in this film is very well done and the hand drawn animation is very impressive as they timed each scene just right and the character designs are very good in this film as well as superb backgrounds.Also the humor really works for this film and some of the most creative lines ever written came into this movie;The music in the movie set the tone for the film which helps deserve it very well.The voice acting is excellent, Surprising that David hasn't done many animation films because he did a very good job in this film, John Goodman does a excellent job in this film and help makes his character believable. Eartha's performance was just right for Yzma the main antagonist of the film she really deliver here. Patrick was pretty good as Kronk and he made the character very likable and funny throughout the film.It's a smart choice that they didn't make this into a musical style because it might not had work but nevertheless the film does well on it own. The film has some of the most entertaining scenes ever and will make you laugh. Also the film focus more character development and the relationship with the characters you actually can appreciate them and they make the film work very well.With very good animation, a clever story, and very well done voice acting you can't go wrong.I give The Emperor's New Groove an 8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A great buddy road trip movie,"Even if you didn't know the story of this movie's hellish development, you can FEEL the trouble under the surface of this thing. The animation budget's a little weird, they got Eartha Kitt and don't even have her sing, and the vibe of the story is kind of un-Disney. Extremely ""who cares, we're out of time, just put something in theaters.""Being so fast and loose gives Emperor's New Groove a nimble quality that really helps sell the tremendous amount of slapstick that carries almost all of the humor. It loves to blindside you with just the absolute dumbest gags.My favorite being Patrick Warburton as Kronk, who is conversing with the Angel and Devil on his shoulders. Kronk is unsure of the Devil's evil suggestions, but the Angel looks down, sees the Devil doing one handed push-ups, and admiring his strength goes ""No no, he's got a point"" in that tone only Patrick Warburton can do.Nothing short of a small miracle and the sort of accident you can't create on purpose.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

10/10,"Great way to close out the renaissance.Tarzan (1999) - is the final movie in the Disney Renaissance and it certainly was a great note to leave on. The story is very basic and easy to follow but they allow so much to happen when it comes to character development and showing off the incredible surroundings of the jungle. All the characters are very memorable and I especially love the way they work Tarzan and Jane's relationship. I love how each of them work of each other and how Jane helps Tarzan understand the ways of the human life. The gorillas also have their moments of tenderness and I do like how each of their views of Tarzan are well understandable. I kinda will admit that the villain is sort of weak but he still acts as a major threat to Tarzan even though it's kinda obvious how Disney is hiding the fact that he's really a villain and not a good guy. The way they work the animation is absolutely incredible. It is just mind blowing and how they manage to combine hand-drawn animation with CGI effects. It makes the look of the jungle feel so immersive and lifelike. The action scenes definitely are proof of how great the animation is and it moves at such a fast and steady pace. It's probably some of the most action pack stuff I've ever seen in a hand drawn film. The overall music score is great for setting the mood and any type of scene. Whether there's a heartfelt scene or an action-packed sequence, the music is always there to accompany whatever is happening on screen. Phil Collins wrote and performed a few songs for the movie and I think all of them are heartfelt and catchy. They are all greatly separated from one another and they play their part whenever the moment is right.

The one thing, I disliked was that they gave away a few jokes in the trailer, that would have been a lot funnier if they were left in the context.  Since there was only a few given away, it didn't have a large impact on the movie. Also, I must say, it was perfectly cast!I highly recommend seeing it; no matter what age. It is hilarious!

Loved it.,"The Emperors New Groove is a great family film about an Emperor who has developed some habits along with a very rude personality. It starts of with the Emperor Kuzco voiced by David Spade who invites a simple peasant named Pacha whose voiced by John Goodman into his empire. He then tells Pacha that he must soon move out of his house and make way for Kuzco's new water park. Devastated Pacha soon returns home. Later that night the antagonist of the story Yzma voiced by Earth Kitt, invites Kuzco to dinner as a gesture of no hard feelings for firing her. Their plan however is to poison him, but Kronk voiced by Patrick Warburton grabs the wrong potion changing Kuzco from a human to a llama, and so the adventure begins. This is a great leap from modern day family films in which it chooses a lesser known piece of history dealing with the Mayans and Aztec people. Its a humorous storyline mixed with bits and pieces of action. The cast of characters are great and you also get a feel for them as the plot progresses. Kuzco and Pacha then become the two protagonist as they must put aside their differences and work together to get back to the palace. This teaches children valuable lessons such a team work and friendship and how important they really are. The style and music is great to, The Emperors New Groove really delivers and is a must see for the younger audiences. I give this film a 90% simply because of the originality and the wonderful storyline that this film has.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Hands down, the best family movie this year!","The Emperor's New Groove: Disney (not counting their Touchstone division) produces two kinds of movies: live family oriented films like ""102 Dalmations"" (although the quality is generally better) and animated musicals a la ""Tarzan"" or ""Aladdin"".  Their most recent offering, though patterned on the latter, lacks the trademark songs and forays into morality, opting instead for an old fashioned cartoon.  A gutsy move indeed.Kuzco is a self centered spoiled brat, but when you're the 18 year old ruler of a South American country, that's not a stretch.  When Kuzco fires Yzma, his ""trusted"" advisor and her behemoth helper Kronk, they decide to do away with him.  Although they bungle the attempt on his life, they do succeed in turning him into a Llama.  More troubling than being turned into a beast of burden is Kuzco's knowledge that he is at the mercy of the very peasant whose land he was about to appropriate for a summer home.  Who ever said life is easy?One of the qualities that I enjoyed most about ""Iron Giant"" was that the characters didn't keep breaking out into song - it's not that I don't enjoy musicals, but they can grow tiresome.  I didn't know what to expect from this movie mainly because I knew they had changed the content several times, probably fearing a repeat of ""Road to El Dorado's"" bad box office. Radically altering the course of a film midstream generally leads to problems (does anyone remember ""Supernova""?), and at the very least, I doubt Sting will ever offer to score another Disney film after they scrapped the bulk of his songs.  Fortunately this break with the Disney convention works.Although I'm not a huge David Spade fan, the combination of his skewed sarcastic humor and excellent animation is exactly what the emperor-turned- Llama calls for, making Kuzco a character we like, in spite of the fact that he is a shameless cad.  On the other end of the spectrum is Pacha, voiced by Jon Goodman, the kind and caring peasant who is willing to help Kuzco although it may be to his detriment.  Yzma, Kuzco's scheming right hand woman, is brought to life by Eartha Kitt's raspy voice and spot on animation (before you even hear her voice you know who the ""actor"" is), and is positively scary, but in a nice way.  Finally,  Kronk (Puddy from ""Seinfeld"" who incidentally will be starring in a live-action version of ""The Tick"" on FOX) the sidekick wanna-be, is hilarious as the double-digit-IQ-walking-slab-of-muscle more concerned with cooking than killing.The combination of the sixties style animation, solid characters and slapstick style result in a movie that is pure, simple and unmitigated fun.

"Unexpected Disney fare, but an unexpected delight.","These comments are based on a viewing of the DVD version of this film.Simply put, this is Disney, but it isn't the Disney we are accustomed to. David Spade is notorious for his sarcasm and snide comments, and they abound in this film.  The storyline here is darker than previous Disney animated films.  One of the special features on the DVD is a deleted scene in which Pacha's village is destroyed, and while it is shown in its unfinished form, it is obvious why it wasn't included.  It is a very dark, violent, and foreboding scene, and it brings new light to the film, especially when watched after viewing the movie in its entirety.  Simply put, this isn't your typical children's movie, and it seems to be aimed at a more mature audience.The story revolves around Emperor Kuzco, an egotistical ruler with a heavy hand, who is turned into a llama by his nemesis Yzma and her faithful sidekick, Kronk.  Kuzco is ends up on Pacha's cart, and is transported back to his village, and various hijinks occur as Pacha tries to help Kuzco return to his palace, and ultimately regain his human form.In my humble opinion, Kronk steals the show here.  Spade & John Goodman do a good job as Emperor Kuzco and Pacha respectively, but Kronk, while something of an idiot, brings comedic moments to this film which are necessary.  Watch his facial expression on the way to the ""secret lab,"" and keep an eye on him during the ""jump-rope"" scene at Pacha's hut later on in the movie.  Simply put, it's hilarious.  Patrick Warburton's flat delivery of lines for this character adds dimension (surprisingly) to the ""typical idiot"" character which appears in almost all Disney films.Rumor has it that this film was originally a lot different, a lot darker, until Disney stepped in and took over.  A viewing of the deleted scene gives some insight into what the film may have been like had it not been changed. I've always been amazed by the fact that Disney can make films geared at kids, but which also appeal to adults. However, more recently, and unfortunately, Disney has used its reputation for having excellent story lines and creating films which teach lessons to enter into the ""direct-to-video"" market, thus taking advantage of children and their parents, and disappointing Disney fans who would rather see films which are good enough for theatrical release. Even though these particular films are released by Disney, they are just like any other ""direct-to-video"" film.  They should be avoided, and aren't anything to write home about.While not as good as Tarzan or The Lion King,   The Emperor's New Groove is a pretty good way to keep the kiddies quiet on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon, and the adults might get something out of it as well.Note:  The DVD version contains, among other goodies, a neat little animated game, a multiple choice Q&A which you can play with the children after they watch the movie.  To keep them extra quiet, tell them to watch close because they are going to be tested!  :)My Rating:  7/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

A really pleasant surprise from Disney,"Having reluctantly been dragged along to see this, it was one of those rare occasions as an adult when I was glad I had been. This is a real surprise from Disney - not the usual twee nonsense, but an intelligent movie that is also fun. I thought there was even a bit of satire in there - now how long is it since there's been satire in a Disney movie. What about the kid? Well, my son enjoyed it, I think, - there is just enough action and razamatazz to keep the kids entertained - but this is really one for you long-suffering adults. If you have the chance, do try it! Honest, it's a real eye-opener. PS. I realise that after what I've said, this film will of course fade to obscurity. Does anyone out there care anymore about intelligent movies, especially animated ones? I doubt it.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
At least something to enjoy,"""The emperor's new groove"" is a fast paced screwball comedy a little in the style of ""Aladdin"", though not as good. The animation is superb and the backgrounds are colorful. This time, the movie isn't spoiled by the recently ubiquitous computer animation.For me, ""The emperor's new groove"" was just unpretentious fun with marvelous visuals and as such it is by far better digestible than classic tales turned into happy-ended child amusement (I am thinking of the awful ""Tarzan"" here).",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney is back in the saddle.,"Finally, Disney has reverted back to madcap mayhem and saved us from the frustratingly boring love songs by performers whose best days passed 20 years ago (or, in some cases never arrived) inherent in so many Disney cartoons of recent memory.  The sharp, angular animation, the hilarious writing and voice talents, the clever references, and the editing and direction make this movie an unappreciated gem.  Hopefully, in time, more people will come to appreciate this as cartoon film-making of the highest caliber.  There was no obvious selling out by dragging dopey, ""we-wrote-this-song-to-capture-an-overrated-Academy-Award-for-Best-Song"" pabulum to be force-fed upon an audience that just wants to see the old Disney magic doing what it does best.  This movie strikes the fine balance of appealing to people of all ages without sacrificing the quality of the writing and dialogue - not an easy task.  Seeing this movie has instilled a sense of faith in me that Disney CAN still deliver the goods without relying on selling soundtracks.  While David Spade (as Kuzco) and John Goodman (as Pacha) deliver hilarious and warming performances, Patrick Warburton (as Kronk) and Eartha Kitt (as Yzma) are two of the most enjoyable villains in Disney's pantheon of characters.  Kronk is probably the most lovable henchman Disney has ever produced.  The supporting voices are top-notch (especially Wendie Malick as ChiCha) and bring out a well-rounded characterization void of caricature.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A dry, clever, wacky groove.  Recommended.","I had heard that Disney was trying something a bit different with this picture, and knew from Kuzco's ""Bring it on."" waterfall line in the preview that I'd probably like this form of different.  This is the first Disney pic in awhile that doesn't really take itself seriously at all, and it flourishes as a result.There's a plot, but it's not such a big deal as in most Disney fare. Jerkish emperor receives his comeuppance and learns a lesson, yada-yada. The fun's more in the telling, as given here.  The change of heart doesn't come so terribly quickly as to be disconcerting, and feels somewhat earned through the chaos that ensues.  And chaos it is...through a rollercoaster ride of sight gags, verbal wordplay, conventional satire and a semi-talking squirrel.David Spade lends a biting sarcasm to Kuzco that is rare for ""hero-types"" in cartoons, and Patrick Warburton really steals the show with his understated and underneuroned Kronk.  I came to be waiting for every dry aside out of Kronk's mouth, he's so hilarious.  Such a lovely eulogy.I don't understand why some have said this is boring, as it's a pretty snappy ride.  I do understand why some haven't laughed so much-you need a pretty quick and warped mind to catch some of their throwaway lines, which are really some of the funniest.  Kids will like the sight gags, but will miss much of the verbal humor.  Take it out for a spin, you may be pleasantly surprised.  Just, don't diss Kronk's spinach puffs.  He's a little sensitive about that, you know.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"For kids, parents, singles of any age, Funny, Funny, Funny","Having a couple of young boys, I've seen almost every Disney cartoon there is.  Emporers is, by far, the funniest. Casting is outstanding, David Spade as Kuzko, John Goodman as Pacha (Kuzko's cohert), Puddy from Seinfeld as Kronk (the henchman) and Ertha Kitt as Yzma, the Villian Lady ""Scary beyond all Reason"".This movie is so well written that I found myself laughing out loud reading the above reviews remembering the parts in the movie.Kronk ""Patrick ""Puddy"" Warburton, is probably the most entertaining of the bunch.  He is Yzma's (Ertha Kitt) henchman, but doesn't really seem to realize that he's being a bad guy.  His deadpan delivery is nothing short of brilliant. ""That'll Work""David Spade is spot on as the Main character, an overly full of himself Emporer loving, himself, and himself as much as himself.  This is typical, albeit clean, David ""No Touchy"" Spade humor.Goodmans part as Pacha was just fine, as the unobtrusive, ""Nice Guy"" straightman for Kuzko.The story is a non factor, don't let the beginning Tom Jones Musical thing make you turn it off, after that there are no more musical numbers, just laughs.You'll likely need to watch this a few times to catch everything, as you may laugh through the next funny part.

Definitely a David Spade!!,"Any fan of David Spade will love ""The Emperor's New Groove.""  The movie poster in itself is a collectible, and the film is absolutely hysterical. It's filled with dry humor, sarcasm, and vanity as well as semi-touching sincerity and cuteness.  My brother and I were the only people in the theater not attached to a seven-year-old, but we definitely appreciated the movie, and I can't wait for it to come out on Tuesday.  David Spade, in true fashion, makes no attempt to disguise his voice, and you know it's him from the first line uttered.  The role of Kuzco is perfect for him.  His humor dominates the movie, making it one of those Disney greats that appeals to both adults and kids, like Toy Story.  Awesome, hilarious, entertaining, well-paced movie.",,Anonymous,Animation

Modern Disney with a big pinch of Hilarity.,"Its sad to think that the new wave of animation attracting the movie-going public has been coming from animators that prefer to use the computer generated modelling for their films (Shrek, Monsters Inc. etc..)These films are by no means bad, but personally, the more ""old-fashioned"" style of animation created on the drawing boards seems to hit a sweeter chord than those that have been brought about using 3D models and backrounds (though Finding Nemo and Toy Story are brilliant too, I must admit). Perhaps its the feeling that these films are more reminiscent to the way things were before the digital age, or perhaps its the fact that the drawings for the 2D movies give it that extra ""cartoony"" feel without the concept of realism and hence, can simply be enjoyed to the max as a .... cartoon.What The Emperor's New Groove does so well where possibly others have failed is that it does not take itself seriously, not because it lacks realism, but due to the actual script and storyboard itself. There aren't many drama moments that try to make the audience weep and when it does happen, the makers have opted to add a quick punch line or a quick extra animation short that makes you laugh out once again. Some may argue that this gives the movie less substance but this in fact is a refreshing change to the tried and tested formula of the happy-to-sad-then-happy-again rollercoaster many other animation films have become famous for.I for one am extremely pleased with this Disney release and however you want to look at it, The Emperor's New Groove is a great success and should be viewed by everyone simply for the - very many - comedic moments it has to offer. Brilliant.Rating: 5/5",,Anonymous,Animation
not your typical Disney fare,"And that is a GOOD thing. Disney used to make good animated features when I was younger (e.g. Aladdin, Lion King, etc), movies that managed to toe the line between overly sentimental smarmy and utterly mindless fart jokes, all the while throwing in a catchy (if frequently annoying) musical number or ten; nowadays they make pretty well unmitigated garbage. From about the time they made Pocahontas on... ugh, it all got so preachy, lost the ability to make the adults suffering through the movie laugh at a few choice 'older' jokes secreted in - sorry, I'm blathering.Anyway, Emperor's New Groove is a fantastically funny movie. Seriously, the only thing I can think of is that someone storyboarded this out as your average Disney tripe (as you can see shades of formula in it), but then the actual writers and animators busted out a bottle of JD and rewrote it before passing out on the tables.David Spade usually just annoys me, as he usually (almost unfailingly, really) plays a total jerk with no redeeming qualities, but here he plays a self-centered young emperor who actually *gasp* learns a thing or two and grows up a bit in the course of the movie, all without soapbox lecturing or moral-spouting song-and-dance numbers. John Goodman lends a nice turn as the loyal (if gullible) yet stern peasant who helps the emperor because it's the right thing to do. Meanwhile, Eartha Kitt and Patrick Warburton steal the show with wonderful and ludicrous lines, situations, plots - you name it.This movie is so full of rapid fire jokes and quick visual gags that you almost have to watch it several times to catch everything, and even then it's a great movie to relax and let loose a few laughs. I know I bought the DVD, and have watched it many times since. Trust me, this is your best bet for an animated movie out of the States, at least as far as the past few decades are concerned.""Who's in my chair..?""""Ooh, ooh, I know! I know!

Disney's New Groove,"'The Emperor's New Groove' continued an emerging tradition in new millennium Disney, straying further from the Broadway-inspired hit features that characterised the studio's output the decade prior. A satirical cautionary tale, it possibly remains one of the company's most underrated efforts.Having had a turbulent production, it's interesting to see that the 'Emperor' which finally saw the light of day is a witty, almost cruel antithesis to all the positivity associated with the Mouse House. There are several times when the film jars so much with the Disney philosophy that it feels like it doesn't belong in an animated canon of classics including such beloved, whimsical features as 'Snow White' and 'The Lion King'. But this isn't to detract from what is a hilarious, still (somehow) family friendly feature; it's just that it is worth pondering what led to the version of 'The Emperor's New Groove' that saw release at the start of a near ten year period where the studio's successive releases rapidly declined in quality and relevance to the Disney ethos.As hard as it is to believe, John Goodman lent his voice talent to Disney long before he played Sulley in 'Monsters, Inc', which is an excellent reminder of how this film was so quickly, and so easily, forgotten. What's most notable is the satire - the film is saturated with it - would soon be popularised by the likes of 'Shrek' as other animation studios emerged.While a viewing for parental guidance purposes beforehand shouldn't be scoffed at, 'The Emperor's New Groove' is, by large, wholesome family entertainment, just not in the same vein as the Disney you may be familiar with.",,Anonymous,Animation
So angry that it's underrated,"I must admit, that when I saw previews for this, it looked liek a dreck.

Disney does a full-length Warner Bros. cartoon,"This is one of the best movies I've seen all year.  Not a Disney musical at all.  The only songs are the opening and closing credits (by Tom Jones and Sting, respectively).  Instead, it's the animated tale of redemption.Now, it's a silly movie.  The humor is hardly highbrow.  A lot of it relies upon the snideness of David Spade's persona, but I like that sort of thing and I laughed all the way through it.And with Eartha Kitt in this, it becomes that much better.  She makes the perfect villain (and with a small nod to her past as Catwoman from the old TV Batman series).The jokes come fast and furious with the jabs and barbs hitting everyone, including the movie, itself.  Dare I say it?  Yes, I do.  Disney has finally figured out that spark of zaniness that has always been a hallmark of Warner Brothers cartoons.  I've always felt that Warner Brothers knew how to make a short while Disney knew how to make a full-length and never the twain shall meet.  And that was because silliness is hard to maintain for very long while condensing sweetness down to such a short time makes it cloying. Well, Disney has figured out the former.If you can't handle silly, if you're looking for real meaning, if you can't appreciate sheer ridiculousness simply for its own sake, then you'll hate this movie.If you appreciate following the joke where it leads, if you can go with the gag without worrying that it doesn't make logical sense, if you like the sidetracks better than the main path, this is a must see.",,Anonymous,Animation

As far as I can see, the only people who will take offense at this movie are hardcore, old-fashioned Disneyphiles who are unwilling to accept that times are changing. It's the the new millennium, people! Walt's successors should very well include David Spade in the hallowed tradition of an annual animated masterpiece! (Save ""The Three Callbaeros"", of course).In addition, the movie dragged very little (if not any at all) and captured my rapt attention from beginning to end. The animation was lively (while not revolutionary), the voice casting was impeccable, and most importantly... the comedy WORKED! Spade was neither too cloying nor too repressed, which produced some genuinely hilarious moments within the film. Aside from that - though - the real star was Patrick Warbuton as evil second banana Kronk, who's understated stupidity counteracted Yzma's (a wonderfull y throaty Eartha Kitt) menacing bite with unusual flair.To end this wordy review, I can only sum up my satisfaction with a single, succinct sentence:""See this movie!""Hopefully, you will not be disappointed.",,Anonymous,Animation

It goes into ancient South America, it's about an arrogant, nasty, horrible Aztec Emperor Kuzko (David Spade) who wants to build a beach resort on top of a hill occupied by a lama herder named Paca (John Goodman) and his entire family. Kuzco offers him the opportunity to find a new place to live before he knocks down his house.

"A comedy, yes, but also a young man's odyssey","""The Emperor's New Groove"" is not like other Disney animated classics. Where's the romance, for one thing?  The falling in love at first sight, the instant standard love song?  In this film, friendship is the emphasized relationship.  It's a buddy flick.The film takes place around the time of the Incan empire, but don't expect historical accuracy.  This film is to Incan history what ""The Flintstones"" is to prehistory.The films is more irreverent and quirky than any of its Disney predecessors. Still, I took seriously the odyssey of Kuzco, the emperor-turned-llama. This handsome young man is arrogant and selfish, yet one doesn't hate him. One senses deep down he has the potential to be a good person if he can just get over his spoiled upbringing.  It may take the trial of turning into a beast, a la Disney's ""Beauty and the Beast"", to get him to take a good look at himself.  But will he learn?  This film kept me guessing.  On the one hand, it would be a shame is he learned nothing from his trials.  But on the other hand--this is a quirky and irreverent film, if you remember.  Perhaps the filmmakers would consider it the ultimate joke if after all he'd been through, Kuzco learned nothing.  See it for yourself to find which road Kuzco chooses.",,Anonymous,Animation

I laughed out loud so many times at this movie (the first time a Disney film has made me guffaw since ""Alladin""). David Spade is perfect as Kuzco.

"Disney, Warner Brothers-Style","I'm not a Disney fan.  I admire the sheer artistry of their work, the way each of their animated features is a technical marvel, but they lack soul and unpredictability.  Lately, Disney's films seem more like two-hour commercials for toys and CD soundtracks and McDonalds merchandise and Saturday morning spin-offs.But not this.  I walked into ""The Emperor's New Groove"" expecting the typical Disney corporate product, and came out reminded of the classic Warner Brothers Looney Tunes.  It's like the Disney screenwriters and animators have been saving up all their attitude and screwball gags from the last couple of features and put them all in here, one comic-anarchy joyride. Only one song (delightfully sung by Tom Jones), no adorable animal sidekicks, just wit and humor.  Sure, the plot is thin, and it doesn't have the same visual polish as ""Beauty and the Beast"" or ""The Lion King,"" but you get swept along so quickly you hardly notice.The vocal casting here is perfect.  A little David Spade goes a long way for me, but here he's perfect as the self-absorbed Kuzco.  John Goodman is his usual Everyman self as Pacha, and Eartha Kitt and Patrick Warburton are fantastic as the villains Izma and Kruk.  By the time it was all over, I wouldn't have minded spending another hour or two with these characters, delightful and unique as they were.I'd like to think ""The Emperor's New Groove"" marks a new direction for Disney in the 21st Century, but I doubt it.  From what I understand, ""Groove"" is something of a throwaway, created out of a half-completed traditional animated feature and given a life of its own.  Instead I think this will stand as a monument to the energy and wit Disney could have if they stepped outside their deeply-carved niche (read: rut) and tried a new groove of their own.  ""Groove"" will forever stand apart, much like ""Fantasia"" sixty years ago; a unique stepchild unlike anything Disney has done before and is unlikely to do again.",,Anonymous,Animation
Odd yet hilarious.,"The rhythm of The Emperors New Groove is different than any of the previous offerings from Disney.

Disney's tongue in cheek in spades....,"This is straight outta 'Hercules' and 'Aladdin', but just without the underpinnings which made the Bloo Genie such a smash in '92. It's closer to 'Hercules', a kinda Looney Toons romp without much attention being paid to trad. Disney stuff like songs, cutie animal sidekicks, etc. Nothing particularily dramatic here-the llama/Spade character heads back to his city with a Little John type guy to try and get his throne back from Evil Witchwoman Eartha Kitt.Things like Spade breaking into the narration, characters cutting to the chase, the whole extended romp through the Jungle, or in the canyons or the restaurant episode-are quite funny. You don't necessarily remember much after watching it; and there's nothing more to be learned from this any than you would from an old Tex Avery Droopy short.  Have a good time and don't sweat the details that much.*** outta ****, maybe rated a wee bit too high, but what the heck, it's alotta fun and worth the time.",,Anonymous,Animation

Not much time passes between each laugh and David Spade's sarcasm is brilliant. If you know his past roles on SNL and other movies, it makes it that much funnier.Kids and adults will laugh and enjoy this movie. It is quick paced and best of all there are not a ton of really lame songs like in most Disney Movies. There are also no really sappy parts or any goody-goody characters.

Archaic for its time?,"Made in the year 2000, I wonder why there wasn't effort to cast THE main character with consideration to the Inca setting of the whole movie.I won't rate this film, given that I'm watching over 20 years after its release, but it was disappointing and I really expected better, even for its time. :( Certainly, there will be people who wonder why it matters at all, but representation does matter; for the children watching these movies, for the way we all represent marginalized people in our society; it really is worth understanding and I feel like we knew better even then.Ultimately, I found it distracting; the Inca Emperor is voiced very distinctly by a well-known actor who is a poor fit for the heritage presented. Not a commentary on David Spade himself, so much as it being ""yet another film"" where representation wasn't a factor in casting in a pretty glaring way, without any discernible reason.I was looking forward to watching this movie, but I was really disappointed with Disney, on this one. I guess it's a cult classic, but I don't see why, personally.Voice acting needs to vibe with the content on the screen; that's pretty fundamental, particularly if it's THE main character. Couldn't get into it :/",,Anonymous,Animation
To Sum Up In A Word: Zany.,"I wasn't overly enthused by the previews for this film, but I tend to enjoy a good animated film, so I was still going to give this one a chance.  What I WASN'T counting on is the fact that I would be laughing out loud in the theaters on a constant basis, and even more when I got the movie on DVD.""Emperor's New Groove"" is kind of light on story.  There's no epic feel to it and the situations are silly.  But I think that's what makes the film. It's incredibly fast-paced with a great sense of comedic timing (""reaction"" humor is one of the funniest forms of comedy out there, in my opinion), witty one-liners, and complete unpredictability make it stand out from the other Disney films.  It makes fun of itself, speaks directly to the audience at time, and when it throws logic out the window, it doesn't hold back on pointing it out.  Disney's never done (not to my immediate recollection, anyway) a ""buddy flick"" before, and the fact that it doesn't pull any stops on the comedy makes it really enjoyable.  And to it's true appeal, Yzma and Kronk are by far some of the most entertaining villains that Disney has done in a LONG time.  Finally, bad guys with real personality.  And for those who fear a song-filled Disney movie, ""ENG"" only has one song at the beginning. Everything else is WAY out there.The 2-Disc DVD is worth the money.  Tons of stuff on the animated process. Disney Home Video has come a long way in doing their films right.  I wish the earlier ones had been treated this well.I haven't laughed this hard at a Disney movie since the original ""Aladdin"".",,Anonymous,Animation
Disney as Looney Tunes - Loved it!,"The Emperor's New Groove is quite simply the most entertaining Disney movie in recent memory (Fantasia 2000 notwithstanding).  The deadpan humor of Spade, Goodman and company delivered in... well, spades.Patrick Warburton basically stole the show, however, as the goofy and less-than-threatening henchman Kronk.Highly recommend this insta-classic from Team Mouse.  Check it out.8.5 out of 10.",,Anonymous,Animation
The best Disney film in ages...,"So, what was I expecting when I first went to see this? Well, at the time, I was an eleven-year-old girl, going out to see the latest Disney, with my family, then, the occasion was more important than the film. Now, (sadly), the film, is a lot more important than the occasion to me, which is why I am writing this, although I have to say, when I sat down to watch it with my dad earlier, we enjoyed laughing together :)Not only does this film, have a VERY well-written script, a great plot, some great characters (Kronk is THE best!!!), good animation and a great moral message, it has that original Disney atmosphere, which I don't think we have seen in a film since Pocahontas.Don't watch this if you are looking for a deep-and-meaningful, challenging, intelligent film (well duh, this is Disney!), but if you are looking for a warm, touching film, which will have you chuckling all the way through, its a complete must-see!The only thing I have left to say about the film is, 'Bless you, for coming out in public'!",,Anonymous,Animation
A worthy addition to the Disney lineup,"In this day of computer animation, fine though it may be, Disney bucks the trend to produce another hand-animated feature. And the results are wonderful! Stylistically animated, the results are nowhere near as lush as the Little Mermaid, but seem to suit the film perfectly. Kudos to the cast for wonderful voice-acting. Spade and Warburton shine, and John Goodman is fine in the role of straight-man Pacha. Don't miss this one!",,Anonymous,Animation
"If you can't laugh at this, your ""funny bone"" is broken!","This has got to be one of the funniest feature-length cartoons done in the past 10 years!   The pace of the writing is a laugh-a-minute (which may be lost on some viewers, especially the young ones), and the cast pulls these gags off perfectly.Spade and Goodman make a great comedic tandem, as do Kitt and Warburton as the bad guys.  Right down to the minor characters, such as the wife and kids, Bucky the squirrel, and even the diner waitress, the humor flows like a fountain.I could go on and on but, without a doubt, this is one where you and your kids can sit down together and be genuinely entertained from start to finish.",,Anonymous,Animation
Fun Fun Fun!,"If you have not seen ""Emperor's New Groove"", I have to recommend it. But, before you watch it, let me give you some advice... 1) Do not look for any profound, groundbreaking animation. 2) Do not expect a complicated story with plenty of plot twists. 3) Prepare yourself for a lot of laughs.This is a funny movie. From beginning to end, I just kept enjoying it. My kids loved it too.It was very refreshing to see Disney move away from some of its old establishments in film. Here, the lead character is a jerk. His plans are cruel, and his transformation into a llama seems justified.David Spade, John Goodman, and Eartha Kitt provided excellent voice performances. (Please forgive me for thinking that Eartha Kitt died years ago!)The price of Disney videos is not that bad. Go ahead and buy this one. You will want to see it again.",,Anonymous,Animation
Funniest Disney Animated Movie Ever,"I am not a fan of Disney. I hate movies in which the characters sing at every opportunity, which, coincidently, is just about the only thing that Disney produces. ""The Emperor's New Groove"" suspends, however temporarily, this annoying characteristic of Disney animated films. Only one such song occurs in this entire movie, and it works surprisingly well with the flow and rhythm of the film. The movie's background music contrasts with the happy-go-lucky, artificial-sounding music of most Disney films. It is an excellent blend of swing and soft jazz. The movie itself is hilarious. It is filled to the brim with humor that is often intellectually-stimulating and irrelevant. Yzma's thick-headed henchman, Kronk, is the best part of the entire thing, recalling the weird and sometimes baffling funniness that existed in the old animated series, ""The Tick."" 4 out of 5",,Anonymous,Animation
Comes close to Monty Python - You'll be laughing 'til the Llamas come home...,"When Disney started touting this movie, my first reaction was ""Weird"". The previews didn't do it justice. I don't think Disney quite knew how to market this crazy rollercoaster laughter trip. We finally had an afternoon free to see it as a family at the dollar movies. To my surprize we all enjoyed it, and were laughing out loud at this great off-beat comedy we weren't expecting. Fabulous performances by Eartha Kitt (Yzma) and Patrick Warburton (Kronk). She's the best Disney Villain since Cruella, but silly rather than sinister. And Patrick's performance as Kronk is priceless. So after watching it again a couple of times on DVD I realized that the comedy is so rich and clever, it reaches the wit-level of the classic Monty Python (but without any of the crudeness). So many great lines. The most memorable part that had me in stitches? When Yzma and Kronk follow Kuzko and Pacha's map trial. Great visual humour. Has to be seen - classic stuff! Well done Disney for breaking the ice and pushing the envelope. I think the fresh approach and stupendous success of Pixar's masterpiece ""Toy Story"" really woke them up. (Note how there are no main characters singing in this one either. Would have been unthinkable for a Disney animated feature a decade ago.)",,Anonymous,Animation
Funnier and better than I expected,"I was tricked into taking two nine-year olds and a seven year old to this movie.  However, I laughed out loud many times.  It wasn't quite worth the $29 I spent on snacks, but that's another posting.Most of the time we laughed together but occasionally I would guffaw at something completely lost on them while they would scream with hilarity at something I thought was dumb.Great family movie.",,Anonymous,Animation
A Disney feature that is just funny ... so VERY funny.,"In The Emperor's New Groove, Disney has finally managed to succeed in making a kids' movie that is just as much fun for a viewer of any other age group. The Emperor's New Groove is just plain funny, with just a bit of a moral and emotional undertone, but whenever this comes to the surface, it is quickly quenched by a sidesplitting oneliner.Disney's recent animated films have been syrupy sweet, drop-dead boring love stories, but this time 'round, we get a much better film that instead utilizes the concept of friendship instead of love. Ripping to shreds a long-enduring Disney tradition, The Emperor's New Groove sports an almost song-less soundtrack by Sting, and the couple of songs that made the cut are entertaining. Otherwise, it just embarrasses me to hear a song come out of nowhere.The Emperor's New Groove is a refreshingly funny change. The human Kuzco even looks like David Spade, and acts a lot like Spade's whiny character in Just Shoot Me. Maybe there's still hope for Disney.",,Anonymous,Animation
Hilarious gem of a movie!,"Okay, when I was eighteen and first saw this movie with my high school friends and fellow movie theater coworkers, we were all laughing so hard we feared that we would get kicked out and we worked there. This movie is a very funny, cute movie with great gags that funny because they're witty or visually amusing, not gross or stupid. It's a great kids' movie and an awesome movie that adults can watch too without being bored senseless.There's an awesome cast, Yzma and Kronk are often funnier than Spade and Goodman, but the chemistry of these characters, the animation, and the jokes are wonderfully witty and original. The squirrel by itself could make this movie.I recommend it to anyone who is tired of watching the average Disney cartoon with less than the best adult-included humor. This movie is funny for all and a sweet movie too.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Funniest Disney film, since Hercules!","My budding hatred of Disney has been cut short with this film. Ever since they had started putting out home video movie sequels (All of which suck)I have begun to lose respect for Disney (with the exception of the Toy Story movies, and It's a Bugs Life, but that was Pixar really, not Disney). Well, it all stops here, with The Emperor's New Groove, a film which is so full of different gags, both kids and parents will be laughing till they can't breathe. To compare the style to Toy Story, but it's actually cell animation (remember cell animation?) which makes it a lot brighter, more vivid, and more detailed. It runs more like an old Looney Toon (those catoons that were on Nickelodeon before the PC police ripped them of and replaced them with Rugrats reruns). Even the voice of David Spade can't turn people away from this movie. Just take my word and go see it, if you don't find it funny, well, I feel really sorry for you",,Anonymous,Animation
One of the Greatest Animated Comedies of All Time...SERIOUSLY.,"If it hasn't already happened, I anticipate it will: ""The Emperor's New Groove"" will become a cult hit. It's spectacularly funny. Why so? Jeez, take your pick: David Spade, Eartha Kitt and Patrick Warburton do unbelievable voice jobs. And the animators have out done themselves with the gags that just keep coming. So many of them in fact that even if you've seen it once or twice, look closely. You'll see more like the NO LLAMAS sign as Kuzco and Pacha exit the restaurant.An absolute classic that is right up there with the BEST of the old Warner Brothers set. Those expecting ""uplifting"" Disney fare ala ""The Lion King"" will be sorely disappointed. All others will get a very unexpected and welcome surprise.",,Anonymous,Animation

BOOM-BABY!,This is a true Disney masterpiece.  While I enjoyed Disney's usual animated formula which is basically cartoon musicals; this move is a refreshing change of pace.  Dave Spade is perfect as the Emporer. And all John Goodman and Ertha Kitt are great in their roles; Patrick Warrburton absolutely steals the show as Kronk the more loveable than evil henchman. I rate this ***** out of *****,,Anonymous,Animation
Nicely surprised...,"The Emperor's New Groove sees Disney take a very large step away from the tired Hollywood-musical formula.  Upon hearing this I was quite eager to see what the studio had up their sleeves, and I'm happy to report that I was pleasantly surprised.This film is an all-out comedy and it doesn't fail to provide.  There were some moments that didn't draw much of a giggle and it was somewhat slow to start off with, but by the film's climax the laughs are coming pretty hard and fast.Also breaking with tradition, there is nothing ground-breaking or state-of-the-art with the animation.  That's not to say that the animation is bad!  It's the standard Disney work, beautiful and subtle, just no CG eye-candy trying to make up for a lack-lustre story.The background music fits in well but there are no show-stopping musical scenes.  A welcome change.  The tunes are nothing memorable which isn't necessarily a bad thing either.As for the characters, Yzma and Kronk in my opinion, steal the show!  There are some hilarious scenes between these two.  I loved Yzma right from the start, and Kronk really does grow on you.  I'm not a big fan of David Spade (or his sitcom ""Just Shoot Me"") and to be honest I walked in feeling a little skeptical about him, but he did a really good job in the role of Kuzco.  Thumbs up to John Goodman as Pacha as well.I can really only sum this film up as ""different"".  But different in a very good way.  The Emperor's New Groove is not about the fancy-schmancy animation or the music or the big-name voice actors.  It's about the story, and a good one at that.  After Tarzan I was beginning to think that Disney had really lost the plot for good but it seems as though they could be back on track, breaking some new ground as well.As with all Disney animated flicks, this is one aimed at the kiddies but it seems as though the humor has matured just a bit (seems like the current trend), so young people and adults are bound to get a few laughs.  Well worth the admission price, definitely worth a rental.",,Anonymous,Animation
"by all logical reasoning, it doesn't make sense...","The premise of The Emperor's New Groove sounds bizarre, stupid, and definitely not funny. However, between well-crafted characters and many many great lines, this movie ends up being far better than it deserves to be. There are so many absurdly hilarious moments that it is one of my favorite Disney movies. It may not rise to the classic level such as films like Aladdin (the best disney movie ever), Beauty and the Beast, or even Mulan, but it is a very funny flick that is worth seeing. 7.5 out of 10.",,Anonymous,Animation

The other reviews complain about the plot not making sense, I want to remind them that first- this is a disney film, and second- it is a animated cartoon for children!

Most of the of best humor in the film comes from the henchmen Kronk (voiced by Patrick Warburton).

Pretty funny,"""The Emperor's New Groove"" is another Disney movie with a pretty cool twist. At least it's not prince-saves-princess sort of thing. The voices are really cool, as is most of the story line. I think the coolest person is Kronk - he's so funny and silly and the movie wouldn't be worth seeing if he wasn't in it. The jokes are for older people but the characters are for youngsters - it's pretty much a movie for the whole family.",,Anonymous,Animation
great movie,"I saw a sneak preview of this film.  Great movie, but, it still doesn't match the greatness of the old Disney movies, plus Aladdin, Lion King, Little Mermaid or specially Beauty & The Beast.  Disney has lost it's edge a little, but still seems to dish out good movies.",,Anonymous,Animation
Aladdin's successor?,"OK, so every modern Disney animated film is about ""being oneself"" (based on the understanding that ""oneself"" is actually quite a nice person really). So take that as a given.Funny. Very silly, very funny. General slapstick and obvious impossibilities abound. As many have pointed out already, it's reminiscent of Warner Bros. (Bugs Bunny et al.), but also of the more stupid ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" or ""Dangermouse"" variety.Disney moral overtones are kept to a minimum, which is refreshing in itself. And they managed to avoid the slew of schmaltzy songs usually destined for the Academy Awards. Now if they can only avoid ""The Emperor's New Groove 2"", I'll be very happy.",,Anonymous,Animation
not so new but worth the groove,"On the first viewing of this movie, I was disappointed with the film, especially when compared to films such as The Lion King.However, after video release, I gave it a second chance and found the groove.  The one liners are great in this movie and I find myself laughing through repeat viewing.  The visuals are stunning and as a lover of old school animation, it's a joy to enjoy a non-computer animated film.My favorite character is Kronk, voiced by Patrick Warburton.  His bits with his shoulder devil and angel are the best moments of the movie.TENG is nothing new from Disney and may not be a masterpiece, but it's fun family viewing and if you relax, you'll find the groove.",,Anonymous,Animation
A new direction for Disney?,"I was lucky enough to snatch a couple of tickets to a sneak preview to this movie in Toronto on December 11. Actually, ""snatching"" might be a little too strong a word--although I *did* take the time to go to the cinema and buy advance tickets, the theatre was not even half full.Too bad for those who missed it, I guess, because The Emperor's New Groove is a pretty good film. In my opinion, it marks a stark departure from previous Disney movies, not only because of its release date, but also because of its style, which includes only two very low-key songs and is a continuous sequence of sketches that might have well been taken out of Saturday Night Live (of the old type, of course).The lack of a significant budget and clear direction--which shows not only in the quality of the art (still splendid and yet a little lower than one would expect from a Disney movie), but also in the fact that the script seems to have gone through a lot of change--make me wonder if this represents a new direction in which Disney movies are going: a sort of ""experiment"" that moves away significantly from the classic Disney pieces, which--it seems to me--have followed the same routing all the way up from Snow White.Hopefully, this movie will demonstrate that it is possible to hold an audience captive with an animated movie even if it's not a musical and be successful enough for Disney to continue on this path with more ""experiments""!",,Anonymous,Animation
"More wit, less songs","A funny and well done entertainment.  Witty dialogue and hilarious scenes. I particularly liked the diner sequence.  David Spade is excellent as the egocentric emperor.  Unlike most Disney animated features, it has only one song, a welcome relief.",,Anonymous,Animation
Just for fun,"This is an amusing (and almost unrecognizable) take off on SNOW WHITE with Kuzco as Snow White, Yzma as the evil witch, and Pacha as all 7 dwarfs rolled into one big lug. The film is lots of zany fun for adults and kids without a terminal case of cutsies and the instant songfest soundtrack.It's good to see that the Disney company can make a savy, fun movie that combines expressionistic art with traditional Disney imagery. The movie is lightweight and a lot more fun than many recent Disney offerings.",,Anonymous,Animation
Disney's New Groove? I Hope So!,"While Disney's feature films are, with a few exceptions, masterpieces, very few of them provoke genuine laughter. The Lion King has a few chuckles in it, and Robin Williams' Genie in Aladdin is nothing short of hilarious, but something always seems held back. Not here. Perhaps Disney is learning a few lessons from the witty and wonderful folks at Pixar.Everything is here: sight gags, clever dialogue, slapstick, screwball, satire, and lots more. Even when the movie resorts to clicheed plot devices, they are actually pointed out so we can all laugh at them. This movie is something special.Even the animation is brilliant. Stylish, bright and bombastic, the style reminds one of the similarly flashy but painfully unfunny Hercules. There are some obvious caricatures involved, and the effect is wonderful, blurring the line between fantasy and reality.The voice cast is wonderful. David Spade joins the long line of entertainers who have had little relevant voice-acting experience, and yet excel, even though few of their other projects are kid-friendly. Others include Eddie Murphy, Demi Moore and Jerry Orbach. John Goodman plays it straight, even heart-felt at times, but still retains a genial charm and never seems too mushy or rigid to be funny. Together, Spade and Goodman have marvelous chemistry and have their personal touches to add to the funny scenes and yet can handle the more dramatic scenes with dignity. This is fine work. Eartha Kitt and Patrick Warburton are likewise hilarious. Kronk is just one in a long line of ""Disney lunks"" and yet is one of the few that every member of the audience goes home liking. John Fiedler, a Disney veteran, shows that he still has what it takes, even at 75.Stereotypes are thrown out the window. (So is an old man, but that's another story.) Kuzko is obviously an orphan who has no intention of taking his responsibilities seriously, and for the longest time seems beyond redemption. Only at the end, do we feel he deserves his happiness and his surrogate family. This is a ""poor little rich boy"" who doesn't realize it through his self-delusion and immaturity until very late in the movie. Kuzko is not given a pretty girl to pursue and win the hand of. Such corny plot devices have no place here. A further nice touch is that it would be too easy to make Pacha a single father, but his whole family is not only included but empowered.Little touches mark the loving care placed into the project. The scene where a broken-hearted Kuzko is forced to eat grass like the other llamas reminds us of the Prodigal Son (which, of course, he is). The scene in which Yzma and Kronk attempt to fly across a ravine owes more than just a nod to Chuck Jones.After the appalling Dinosaur, Disney pulled this out of their storage room and surprised and delighted us all. Let us hope that they use this flavour in the future, and remember what animation is truly all about. Not to be pretentious, but to be enjoyed.",,Anonymous,Animation
The Emperor's New Groove delivers,"""The Emperor's New Groove"" is one of the best throw-it-all-away-and-enjoy-it movies I've ever seen. It is in your face, it is funny, it is deadpan, and the animation is that same gorgeous Disney animation that we have always known and loved.In a nutshell, spoiled brat Emperor Kuzco breaks the news over the head of selfless, caring Pacha that he is destroying his village to make way for Kuzcotopia, his ""ultimate summer getaway"". His plans are put on halt when his ex-advisor, Yzma, and her assistant Kronk, plot to kill him with poison over dinner but turn him into a llama instead. Kronk has the llama in the bag, with plans to kill him outside of palace grounds, but then trips over a cat and the bag ends up riding out of town on Pacha's cart. Once he is discovered, Pacha and Kuzco the llama are stuck in a four-day journey together back to the palace to turn him back.Everything about this movie is great. The humor is so dry, and so realistic. (Scenes to look for: The dialogue between Kuzco and Yzma in the dining room once Kronk runs out, realizing his spinach puffs are burning; The dialogue between Kuzco and Pacha the morning after the first night they spent in the wilderness.) The animation is also fabulous. (Scenes to look for: The opening, narrated by David Spade, with the big-eyed pitiful llama slopping around the rain and mud that makes you actually feel bad for him; The zoom-out scene when Kronk has just dropped the bagged Kuzco the llama into a river and, on an impulse, caught him again to keep him from dropping down a waterfall which must fall for eternity.)I also enjoyed the voices that were cast in this movie. All the roles seemed tailor-made for them. David Spade, of whom I am a big fan, was spectacular with a lot of lines, even scenes, that could have fallen flat without his deadpan, right-on voice. John Goodman's resonant voice was the perfect fit for humble, sweet Pacha. Eartha Kitt, with her spitty, articulate, scratchy voice, brought the character of Yzma to life. And I enjoyed Patrick Warburton as the clueless, dumb yet entirely endearing Kronk to no end. In fact, Kronk and ChiCha (Pacha's wife, voiced by Wendie Malick), were my two favorite characters. (Scenes to look for: Any time Kronk is cooking to see him in action; for a glimpse of ChiCha's personality pay attention to Pacha's homecoming.)And this movie was surprisingly funny. To kids AND adults, and everyone in between (which is where I fall). In fact, many of the adults in the theatre were laughing harder than the children. (My favorite joke in the movie? The recurring ""Okay, why does she even HAVE that lever?"" is great, especially the second time, when the llama emerges with the crocodile gnawing on him.)I liked this movie so much that I saw it twice. (The second time was an accident; Cast Away had no empty seats, but this movie was my next in line to go for.)I can't think of any criticism for this movie. Oh yes, and I also enjoyed Sting's music very much -- I am a big fan, but even if I wasn't, the songs are catchy. This movie is very well done, and very, very entertaining. After all, it's not really meant to give you something to think about; it's meant to entertain, and ""The Emperor's New Groove"" certainly delivers.",,Anonymous,Animation
