Compelling and Layered Costume Drama,"The Duchess is a superior slice of costume drama which manages to craft interesting, multi dimensional characters and an involving storyline from the well worn confines of the genre.Keira Knightley plays a very similar role to the one she played in Pride and Prejudice, a feisty, modern woman trapped in a male dominated society. However, whereas Lizzie Bennett's heart and character inspires affection, the Duchess of Devonshire's fosters only reproach and punishment from her traditional and patriarchal husband. Her performance is a standout and demonstrates why she is so highly rated in the face of many disappointing roles in other films. She brings both strength and weakness to the character. Able to deliver withering put downs at her husband and others, whilst showing the pain of her loveless marriage etched into her face.If Knightley is the lynchpin of the piece then it is Ralph Fiennes that elevates it above a crowded genre. Resisting the temptation to play his character as evil, instead he simply plays him as a man of his times. In Fiennes' hands the Duke feels no need to win any bouts of verbal jousting with his wife as he is secure in the knowledge that, as a husband, he is in complete control of the relationship. The Duke also clearly sees very little wrong in his treatment of his wife and acts, as he sees it, in a logic manner making the whole film feel more believable and, as a result, tragic.In terms of the cast the only misstep is Dominic Cooper as Charles Grey, who lends the wide eyes of a political dreamer but doesn't have convincing chemistry with Knightley and plays one of the more one dimensional characters in the piece. However Hayley Atwell impresses by playing her character so well it is possible to describe her as scheming, and manipulative as well as sympathetic and loyal without it seeming a contradiction.The film is deliberately paced so as to give characters and events time to breathe, encouraging the mood that the marriage is a car crash in slow motion, inextricably drawing all the characters further into the muddled mess of their relationships. Overall it's a fully recommended slice of real life costume drama that draws a multi layered drama full of compellingly deep characters from what could easily have been a one note story.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Knightley terrific,It's 1774 England. Georgiana (Keira Knightley) is arranged by her mother Lady Spencer (Charlotte Rampling) to marry the older Duke of Devonshire William Cavendish (Ralph Fiennes). She is eager for high society but finds him personally cold. He brings in a girl who is probably his bastard child. He is bitter that Georgiana delivers him a girl. She becomes a popular figure. She befriends Lady Bess Foster (Hayley Atwell) who is desperate to get back her children from her abusive husband. The Duke starts an affair with Bess in a long line of many mistresses and he is able to get her back her children. Georgiana starts her own affair with Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper).This is a solid costume drama anchored by a powerful performance from Knightley. The other cast members also deliver led by Fiennes. He is a layered villain and a real human being. Atwell is also great as her character is caught up in an impossible situation. This is a slow deliberate burn. The beauty of the costumes hide an ugliness underneath it all.,8.0,Anonymous,History
An entertaining film which promises much for the future,"The career of Keira Knightley has been somewhat of a mixed bag. She has had strong moments, invariably under the direction of Joe Wright, and she has had her less brilliant moments, mainly in the later ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films. But, in ""The Duchess"", an entertaining and moving portrait of Georgiana, the Duchess of Devonshire, she truly shows signs that she is coming of age with a performance of subtlety and nuance.The film has been marketed with not so subtle emphases on Georgiana's relative, Diana, Princess of Wales. The tagline for the film, ""There were three people in her marriage"", is not only, by my count, a miscalculation (a serious miscalculation if you count the dogs) but also guilty of creating a subtext which simply isn't in the film. Anybody looking for a film about Diana will be disappointed. Anyone looking for an entertaining film won't be.The film is a moving portrait of a very tragic figure, brought to life by a career best performance from Keira Knightely. Her abilities have grown over recent years, with ""Atonement"" being her previous best, but here she shows great potential. She is ably supported by Ralph Fiennes, who is on fine form. His performance never descends into caricature or cartoonish villainy, but maintains a sense of humanity, no matter how selfish it is, underneath his characters various inexcusable actions. There is also a fine performance from Charlotte Rampling, though there is a weak link in the person of Dominic Cooper, who is too young for his part and struggles with it.The witty and emotive script has a lot to recommend it and its characters are put into an engrossing and lavish world, successfully created by the director Saul Dibb. Extraordinary costumes fill the extraordinary locations, and there is a beautiful score by Rachael Portman to accompany it. The result is a fairly stylish affair.The film's exploration of unfortunate innocence and the loss of freedom is at times poignant and adds to what is an extremely satisfying experience at the cinema and provides a great deal of promise for the future from its director and its star.",8.0,Anonymous,History
like a  jewel,"a beautiful film. not great or remarkable. only beautiful. for costumes and correct acting. for the light to dark rooms of period. for the flavor of Anna Karenina. and for the atmosphere before the storm. a movie like a jewel from 18 century. more complex than a nice adaptation of a book, almost fascinating for the science of Keira Knightley and Ralph Fiennes to explore theirs roles possibilities, special for performance of Charlotte Rampling and for the air of portrait of a life. a movie like a drop of perfume. noble, seductive, charming. and a different tool for discover the past in a profound way.that is all. a beautiful film about a special universe and remarkable force of a woman to be herself .",,Anonymous,History
"Visually stunning, if lacking in the story","I saw this film for the first time this weekend, and overall I liked it a lot. The story is a little uneventful, with some parts feeling as though they were skimmed over(the political life) or only briefly explored, and the pacing can be pedestrian. That said, it is a visual feast really, as the costumes, sets, scenery, cinematography, interiors and even the carriages are spectacular, while the music gives a lovely touch to the proceedings too. The script is well written and gripping, and the direction is fairly good. Kiera Knightley is great as Georgina, really quite dignified, while Ralph Fiennes is perfect as her philandering husband. To conclude, a visually beautiful film. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,History
More fun in corsets,"The latest slice of period drama to grace our screens is this biopic on Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, who during the 1770s was patroness of the Whig party and prisoner of a marriage which made her, among other things, suffer the indignity of having her husband's mistress living under the same roof. These heritage dramas are an industry all by themselves; the armies of prop hirers, wig and costume makers, researchers, production designers, location scouts and (mostly) British actors who go to make them must find themselves in almost permanent employ. The BBC does them, the Americans have a go at them, and the public can't seem to get enough of them. The Duchess is a superior example of the genre, though nowhere in the league of Kubrick's Barry Lyndon, and combines the spectacle of Keira Knightley looking glamorous in a range of frocks and wigs, while at the same time honing her acting talents (no more those rictus grins), with the guilty pleasure of following the uncomfortable parallels between the fortunes and indiscretions of the ancestress of Lady Diana Spencer with those of the Princess of Wales herself. Lowering over the whole proceedings is the truly superb presence of Ralph Fiennes's Duke of Devonshire, Fiennes an actor who can convey polite discomfiture or threatening ire with slightest twitch of the mouth. In his hands the Duke becomes far less a melodramatic villain than a product of his time, and you almost feel sorry for him. Go and see The Duchess; only those who have had children will balk at the liberties taken with childbirth and breastfeeding. But not even that will spoil the fun.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Stunning,"This is one of my favourite films of all time. Keira Knightley is superb in this role.

"ignore the critics, the duchess is spellbinding","After reading copious amounts of mediocre reviews for ""The duchess"", I wasn't expecting much from this film. However, from the first scene I was utterly absorbed.The film isn't ""just another period drama"", it is an absolutely beautiful and heart-rendering tale of the tribulations faced by Georgian woman. Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, who although is the key character in the film (as you can probably infer from the title), represents the situation of all woman belonging to a patriarchal society, not just the aristocracy.Keira knightly is exemplary in this role. Her facial expression tells more than a script ever could. I enjoyed her performance in ""atonement"" but this was in a whole new league. Ralph Fiennes was also excellent. My best advice is to ignore the critics and come to your own conclusion. My only negative criticism was the rapidity with which Georgiana bonded so intimately with Bess. However, I don't know enough about the social context of the time to really make a judgement.All in all, a deeply moving tale that shouldn't be neglected.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Good story. Interesting and mostly believable in presentation.,"The Duchess - Set at the end of the eighteenth century, The Duchess is based on the life of Georgiana Cavendish (Kiera Knightley), Duchess of Devonshire. The film delves into Georgiana's passionate and doomed affair with Earl Grey, the future Prime Minister, and the complex love triangle with her husband (Ralph Fiennes) and Georgiana's best friend, Lady Bess Foster (Hayley Atwell).Kiera Knightley again does a period piece and again looks mostly out of place. She's British alright, but a few stone away from looking like she belongs in 1770's Britain. It's augmented by the fact that her character, based on a real woman, was supposed to have gone through about 6 pregnancies, 4 of them successful. Knightley's emaciated form is just wrong. What is right though, is her performance. As a mother, as a chasismatic political presence and a woman desperate for a happy life she nails it absolutely.I could have seen a little less focus on the love triangle and a little more on the ""hows"" and ""whys"" of this woman becoming such an important and popular cultural icon in British society. The film glosses over how this came to be, and asks us to take it as a fact after one brief scene showing the Duchess's political shrewdness. It's another case of Hollywood ignoring what's different about a film, preferring the safety of delivering what people have seen before.Fiennes gives such a quiet performance right from the start but it grows and fills the area. It's often a mesmerizing performance because of his rigid adherence to societies expectations and rules at the cost of all else. Fiennes occupies the screen whenever he's in a scene. When he and the Duchess argue, she's like water smashing up against the unyielding cliff. Ralph Fiennes is aw-inspiringly scary in one scene without seeming in anyway over the top or demonizing of what his character represents. Ultimately his character is human and believable; purely a man of his times. His character is so down to earth and in the end simple. All he wanted from his marriage was a son and to be left alone to play with his dogs.A mesmerizing turn from Fiennes in a likable, if familiar film, The Duchess gets a B+",8.0,Anonymous,History
Stunning Bath,"The locations, specially Bath are the most cinematic aspect of this opportunistic tale. The Duchess, it seems, was a distant relative of Lady Diana Spencer's and there is a certain symmetry in their stories but Keira Knightly projects only an ""actressy"" air. She was superb in ""Pride and Prejudice"" but here she just simply poses and stares. Ralph Finnes's awful Duke is much more believable. The extra marital doomed love story between the Duchess and Dominic Cooper left me completely cold and perhaps that's were the problem resides. Their relationship, their ""love"" should have consumed us for the sketchy tale to work, but it didn't. Still, the locations, I repeat, are breathtaking and ""The Duchess"" can be seen if you don't expect to be other than an spectator.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Too old for the role,The was a good one in most parts but the use of Ralph Fiennes as the Duke was wrong at 46 he was far too old to play the Duke of Devonshire. When Georgiana Spencer was 17 she married William Cavendish the Duke of Devonshire a man who was only 26 so a 46 year old was way too old. fun fact her son became the 6th Duke but never married William Cavendish oldest son of third son of 4th Duke who was married to Georgiana's granddaughter,6.0,Anonymous,History
Underrated Film,"""The Duchess"" is a very good film which probably has not gotten the recognition that it deserves. The cinematography is wonderful, the costumes grand, and the acting top notch. Knightley gives one of her best performances and is well cast, and all of the other actors are great as well. This film is more of a psychological drama between spouses and those around them, so there is not a lot of overt action or business in the plot but that is ok. This is about the inner life of a wealthy couple and how it's not always great. Those on the outside sometimes look on with envy, but the reality is often more grim. Georgina is trapped by a bad husband and a societal structure that gives her few options, but I think that it is also important for the audience to remember her ""suffering"" pales in comparison to what many in the world go through. After all she has food, clothing, money, housing, family, servants, etc. There seem to be many of these historical dramas which seek to show the bondage that even the upper-classes face, especially women. But strictures bind everyone to a degree and again a proper perspective should be maintained. The weak point of this film is that it is a sad story, with the husband so unlikeable, but it still made for a good drama or soap. I rate it a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Plop, Plop, Fizz, Fizz","Greetings again from the darkness. The film fascination with Royalty continues thanks to the coolness of costumes and the grand scale of palaces. Of course, a thread-thin relation to Princess Diana doesn't hurt at all either.Somehow the man's world of the Duke of Devonshire, played by Ralph Fiennes, allowed for multiple affairs even to the extreme of having one's favorite side dish just move right on in to the main house ... including meals with the Royal couple!! It would be quite funny, if not so sad.Keira Knightley plays the Duchess with fortitude and the proper amount of reservation. She has become quite adept at the period piece. Fiennes, on the other hand, plays the Duke as if he has a constant stomach ache and is in need of Alka-Seltzer. He totally lacks charisma or even many human traits, save lust for those other than his wife. The third wheel who is promoted to second is played well by Hayley Atwell, a desperate and alternatingly cold and warm mother and friend. Rounding out the cast are Dominic Cooper (Mamma Mia) who plays future Prime Minister Charles Grey, and the true love of The Duchess' life; and Charlotte Rampling as the too proud mother to Knightley, who dispenses very weak advice with a stiff upper lip.The film is well done and the similarities to Princess Diana's marriage are inescapable, but there is just not quite enough substance here. Easy enough to watch, but lacking in historical details ... more of a soap opera approach.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A good story beautifully filmed and with fine performances - especially from Keira Knightly.,"I came away from the cinema after seeing The Duchess feeling I had had my consciousness of what life must have been like for the aristocracy of 18th century England dramatically raised (both literally and metaphorically). The story of Georgiana's marriage unfolds by subtle degrees amidst the most sumptuous of interiors and landscaped gardens - all beautifully filmed and realistically recreated. Apart from the main characters, there appear a rich selection of characters from neighbouring strata of society - aristocrats, political activists, servants and children (as babies and older) both legitimate and illegitimate - all of whom contribute to weaving the screenplay into an immensely fascinating narrative. I was already a fan of both Keira Knightly and Ralph Fiennes before seeing The Duchess, so I was pleased to find that their performances were well up to - and in the case of Ms Knightly even surpassing - my expectations. Even those who aren't normally 'into' period dramas (like me) should, I feel sure, find much to appreciate in this excellent film.",9.0,Anonymous,History

"Saul Dibb presents ""The Duchess"" as an incredibly emotional woman, somebody who has a lust for life","What rather wonderful about this story is that Georgiana Spencer (Keira Knightley) discovers a way to exult in victory over things and to get back some kind of power in a time where, really, women had very little Being someone of great vitality and liveliness, she was very much a dreamer and an idealist, a woman who loved being the center of attention, who loved the fact at some point that her picture was in the paper, that the clothes were always talked of, that her every move was commented onWe are immediately impressed by her presence, by her personality She wasn't behaving quite in accordance with the way in which other 18th century women were expected to behaveBut there was something incredibly sad about this self-conscious lady She was a victim of herself A victim of her own innocence A victim of people using her for their own profit Even though she seemed to have everything, we realize that it was not that simple And with all of her privilege came a lot of moral obligation and things were never what they really appeared to beThe Duke (Ralph Fiennes) was a misanthropic man, rather cold, unemotional and quite cruel He seems to like better his hunting dogs to his young wife Of course with certain values, that he believes were absolutely right and that he strictly held toThis sumptuous period piece also presents the Duchess of Devonshire as a political hostess Saul Dibb's film shows us her dinner parties, her evening events, her fame and its extraordinary effect on her It made her both desperate to please, terrified of doing anything wrong and shocked at her own celebrity and unable to figure out in her own mind why she was quite so famous And we see the crippling effect it has on her sense of self",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Beautiful to behold, but rather soulless","When Quentin Tarantino presented Reservoir Dogs at Sundance in 1992, he famously stated that Merchant-Ivory productions were a major turn-off for him, much like on-screen violence could be for someone else. No one else seems to agree with him, though, or at least not openly, since lots of British directors are trying to become the next James Ivory (the real one lost his mojo with The White Countess, which also marked his last collaboration with the late producer Ismail Merchant). And while Joe Wright hit the jackpot with Pride & Prejudice and Atonement, his colleague Saul Dibb doesn't fare as well with The Duchess, an elegant but frigid costume drama which fails to be particularly dramatic.To secure some kudos, Dibb cast Wright's go-to leading lady Keira Knightley as the film's heroine, Georgiana Spencer, whose life changes radically when the Duke of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes) asks for her hand in marriage. The quality of her lifestyle improves significantly, and all she has to do, as she's frequently reminded by her mother (Charlotte Rampling), is to be a good wife. Unfortunately, that task proves more difficult than expected, since the Duke insists on having a male heir and Georgiana keeps giving birth to boys. All that's left for the poor man is to find a mistress, who happens to be the Duchess's best (in fact, only) friend (Hayley Atwell). Georgiana would like to retaliate by having an affair with her former suitor Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper), but common decency suggests she shouldn't. Why? Because she's just a woman.Unhappy marriage, sex seen as a mere reproductive device, lust for freedom, society of the past seen as a mirror of contemporary events. Sound familiar? yes, the blueprint is obviously Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette, a far superior period piece that manages to speak to the audiences of today. Coppola did that thanks to the soundtrack, which emphasized the idea of the Queen of France being a rebellious teenager; Dibb's approach involves parallels with Georgiana's famous descendant, Princess Diana, as well as a political subtext suggesting the Duchess was one of the world's first feminists. Fair enough, as long as he has the substance to back that up. Does he? No. He puts all his energy in highlighting the natural beauty of 18th century England, and in that sense the movie can be mentioned in the same breath as Room with a View or Howard's End. Elsewhere, though, it's pretty basic, with a story that's been told many times before and has no new twists that can add to its dramatic resonance.The performances are another problem altogether: Knightley might have seemed like a perfect fit for the role and she tries her utter best, but it feels quite theatrical (in a bad way) and overstated, and sh isn't helped by Atwell and Cooper's emotionless staring as support. Fiennes and Rampling, on the other hand, are amazing, especially the former's apparently cold but really entertaining and moving performance - if Bill Murray did period dramas, it would look a lot like that. It's also a bit ironic: the film aims to be female-driven, but is completely stolen by a man.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A question of expectations,"I'm of two minds about this film. On the one hand, Saul Dibb has managed to turn a book into an entertaining film about the trials and tribulation - and, let's keep things in perspective, extremely privileged life - of the frolicking Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire (Keira Knightley). It hits all the targets of the romantic genre, and does so with a nice mix of emotional scenes, witty banter, and even some interesting discussions.Some, because on the other hand the film fails to step beyond the confines of its genre and to really engage with the historical period in which the events take place. The female protagonist gets married to a Duke (Ralph Fiennes), is supposedly unhappy (but wastes little time exploiting the new social options presented to her because of said marriage), and soon the viewer is on board with Georgiana for a ride through all the familiar scenes: her husband's mistresses, her own dalliances with young dreamers, an unexpected pregnancy, etc. etc. The political scheming in the background is mentioned, but there is very little interaction between the events of the story and the historical context. In the final minutes of the film, lines of text assure the viewer that Georgiana was one of the most influential women of her day (in England, one assumes). Unfortunately, not much of that supposed influence is shown in the film, where Georgiana has to make do with a short scene in which she rallies a crowd of a few dozen spectators at a political campaign event.It's all the more unfortunate that this angle of Georgiana's character was left underexposed, because in the first few minutes of the film she quickly finds herself in a rather witty back-and-forth with one of her husband's political allies, Charles Fox (Simon McBurney). Those scenes, so teasingly shown in the trailer, are sadly moved to the sidelines soon after. If those reading this felt similarly disappointed by this, I can recommend Patrice Leconte's 1996 film Ridicule. It's an excellent and very witty look at the French court in roughly the same time.So all in all, if you're looking at this film as a romantic historical drama, it's actually not all that bad. But unfortunately it's also not much more than that. A shame, especially because this is an era in which there should be no shortage of great characters from which to draw inspiration for far more interesting stories and films.A final note on the acting: Ralph Fiennes is great as William Cavendish, Duke of Devonshire, as is Simon McBurney as the politician Charles Fox. Dominic Cooper and Hayley Atwell gave two decent but unexciting (which isn't necessarily bad) performances as Charles Grey and Bess Foster respectively. As for Georgiana herself? I can understand directors are reluctant to use different actors for the same role, but wanting a 22 year old Keira Knightley to portray both a 17 year old newly-wed and a 35 year old mother was perhaps a bit too much to ask. Knightley makes the most of it, and some scenes are well done indeed, but on the whole it wasn't really working out for me.Recommended for easy romantic watching, not so for an engaging historical drama.",5.0,Anonymous,History
"Decidedly good, if slightly one sided....","Not sure why more people didn't like it. Really. It certainly is a handy piece of work featuring both interesting characters and highlighting an interesting life. Maybe people are a bit sick of period pieces from England, especially if they featuring Kiera Knightley and concerns love triangles and such. Lets face it, we have seen most of what is presented here in one form or the another.Still, i found myself very much caught up in this drama. Its hard not to. The costumes (most deservingly awarded) and settings are really beautiful and there are some interesting characters that move in and out in the background, i especially liked (or loathed?) the parts with Bess. Films that are based on true evens inherently tend to be a bit less clichéd and harder to foresee, as i think was the case here, although this certainly cant be said for everything here.I mean, take the part where Georginia wants to feed her babies her own milk. WHY?? Why does films like this force modern views on their protagonists. Because we couldn't sympathize with them otherwise? Please. Stop. Its just annoying.On the whole though its a fine drama with good performances. Knightley proves herself more then worthy, don't believe the haters. Dominic is OK but needs more scenes to flesh out his character. Ralp Fiennes on the other hand manages to make The Duke if not charismatic, at least interesting, even though his character isn't explored as much as it should have been. (seriously WTF is his problem). This drama is rather one dimensional in this respect and though its sibling, Sofia Coppulas Maria Antionette did a better work capturing much of its thematical meat without resorting to pinpointing. That said, its still a very nice film, and if you are into period pieces you owe to yourself to check it out.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Does not catch fire,"A British costume drama - now, there's a surprise. And Keira Knightley in period dress - more surprise. So, why make it? The novel angle in director Saul Dibb's work is that this is a true story about the life of Georgiana Spencer who became the Duchess of Devonshire in a loveless marriage so there is much resonance with the experience of Diana Spencer in our own times.In a sense, this is a movie which cannot fail - after all, there is a steady market for period drama with wonderful English stately homes and repressed English sensibilities. On the other hand, it needs to be rather special to stand out from so many similar outings - and there's nothing unique or outstanding here.Although there is a good supporting cast - Ralph Fiennes as the Duke, Charlotte Rampling as the mother and Dominic Cooper as the lover - this is very much a starring vehicle for young Knightley (still only 23) who is rarely off the screen. This is not her best performance (that was probably ""Atonement"" with ""Pride And Prejudice another success) but it is perfectly competent, even if - unlike her wig - it doesn't catch fire.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Drag Out Your Period Garb for Another Uninspired Stroll Through History,"Keira Knightley has become the go-to actress for portraying spunky feminist characters in period dramas. In her latest, she plays the Duchess of Devonshire, who challenges her husband's right to openly philander by doing some open philandering of her own. But of course she finds that double standards reign supreme, and we are shown the sacrifices a woman is willing to make in order to stay with her children.The movie is period designed to the hilt, and everything else about it (writing, acting, directing) is fine, but none of it is exceptional. Mostly, it just made me want to watch ""Barry Lyndon"" again. The movie doesn't distinguish itself from a hundred other period films you've seen that are just like it, and beyond the specifics of the Duchess's life (which may be enough for some viewers), it doesn't tell us anything we don't already know.I take that back -- it did answer one question for me. If you're wondering whether or not all of those towering wigs surrounded by all of those burning candelabras ever resulted in a pyrotechnic mishap, they did.

"A great period piece, Kiera pulls in a fantastic performance","I couldn't wait for The Duchess, I am just a huge fan of period pieces and Kiera Knightly is becoming a fantastic actress in this genre. I was looking forward to this film mainly because I studied Georgina a little bit in college for my history class and I always thought she was such an elegant and strong woman that stood out from the others. She was like the Madonna of her day, she had a great sense of style, self, and strength. While the movie is not completely accurate, it still was a fine movie to watch. Kiera truly held her own as Georgina and was absolutely stunning. One of the underlining stories that I appreciate in this film is the battle of the sexes. Ralph Fiennes who plays the Duke of Devonshire does a fantastic job as well and he plays this anti-villain, shows the true side of the pain and pressure men felt but how they looked at women as nothing but property. This story truly touches you and makes you grateful for our present day.Georgina is born into a high class family of royalty who is about to be married off to the Duke of Devonshire and everything seems great, G is going to live the high life of class, culture, and being a lady of the people. She comes across the price though: her husband's affairs that are practically rubbed in her face, her life is constantly watched and judged by people, she must be perfect at all times to keep up her reputation as a joyful lady, she is forced to be the mother of the duke's child from an affair he had, as well as she cannot birth a son for the Duke and he will find every opportunity to rub it in her face. All this and Georgina has found another love who she cannot give her heart to fully for the love of her children and people.The Duchess is a fine film that I truly enjoyed. I wouldn't be surprised if Kiera was nominated for best actress during the academy season. I would highly recommend this movie, especially for the period piece lovers. Like I said, this film makes you appreciate what we have today in our modern society and truly makes you feel for the pressures both men and women had to face in that day. Georgina is a figure that I think is very looked over in history when she is one of the strongest presences in England's history. The Duchess, even though not entirely accurate, does a very good job of telling her story and was a pleasure to watch.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Excellent costuming, BUT Knightley is not the actress for this","Fantastic settings: Althorp, Chatsworth, Bath etc; amazing budget on costumes - without a doubt the best since Sophia Coppola's Marie Anotoinette - and a feast for the eyes with it's detail for Georgian times.However, and it's a huge however, no matter how great the production values, and this looks pretty expensive, nothing can disguise the fact that Knightley is beautiful but fails to be more than than a good actress. She is not a great actress. This may be an unpopular comment, but in the scenes with Rampling or Fiennes she lacks depth. As a young ingénue thrust into a marriage she is perfect; as the most political women of her day who found herself in probably the most famous triangle before Prince Charles, not so.She is in no way bad, and this is watchable, but it is not brilliant. It is a great shame. Knightley must find a way to really convey the smallest gesture to mean more. She loses her temper reasonably well, but not completely. One senses there is no madness, it is all too self-conscious and shows too much control. One gets the sense that she is an actress, but not a fully developed one.We enjoyed this, but my wife's comment on The Duchess was the same as mine: looks brilliant, lacks power.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Duchess Looks May Keep You Going,"In a nutshell this is the story of the Duchess of Devonshire. She had a very controversial and lavish lifestyle from marrying at the age of 17 to a much older man who expects nothing less from his new bride than 18th century aristocratic behavior and for her to bear him a male child. Georgianna, the Duchess, is not complying. She enters into society, uses her beauty to advance a political undertone and indulge her own whims whatever they are and at whatever the cost to herself. Her actions eventually undo her wants and when the Duke exerts his wealth and power he brings to bear the power of an 18th century man over a woman.The story is a tragic tale that looks absolutely stunning. Keira Knightley is beautiful as the Duchess. She has been in more than one period piece where her look is akin to wearing drapery. Though very uncomfortable looking in the 18th century garb, Knightley plays it well and appears as though she were made for the costumes. She plays opposite Ralph Fiennes as the Duke and holds her own. The film is a large undertaking for relatively new director Saul Dibb, who also wrote the script for the movie.The film is surprisingly good. At first glance it looks like a total bore, but once Knightley hits the screen there is no doubt your attention is going to be held. There is no urgency to run out to the theater for this one. Save your money and watch it on HBO. **/****.As for the poster it depends on whether you like to look at Keria Knightley. It is a little disappointing that even with an 18th century period piece that the poster designer couldn't find a scene that was usable. The poster is pretty, but could have been so much better.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Great hats and hairstyles!,"Superb job by the costume designers, hairstylists and location spotters. Nice to see Charlotte Rampling in a big production again as well. What of the two leads, Fiennes and Knightley? They really try and some of the scenes are quite moving, but, overall, a second rate script defeats them, which, basically, does not have enough 'meat' to cover the entire length of the movie (meaning that we get lots of scenes inserted on the same principle as 'The Tudors' TV series - 'ten minutes up, undergarments down' and time for a bit of carnal viewing for the audience). Overall, I came away feeling the script writer/director had tried to be just a little too clever in getting the 'parallels' across: a beautiful, young member of the minor aristocracy is 'auctioned off' by her parents to marry a (much older) member of the 'top of society' (have you got it yet?) Her family name is 'Spencer' (have you got it now?) The old fogey she marries only wants her to produce a male heir (come on!) and it becomes apparent he has no interest in her at all as a person. In the end, he forms a relationship with another woman (who has lots of strapping, healthy sons) and they form a 'menage a trois' under the same roof (Ahh, now you've got it!!!!!!) In the end, she fights against love and following her heart (and going for cruises on big yachts in the Mediterranean?) and instead sacrifices herself for the sake of her beloved children. MORALE: women in the 18th century had it rotten and is it not lovely to live in an enlightened, blissful era like ourselves instead??! As I said, I would concentrate on the hats (how DID they keep those things on top the massive haystacks of hair piled up on their skulls???)",,Anonymous,History
Lacking,"While there is much to say about the Duchess of Devonshire, the movie chose to focus on her unhappy marriage, instead of focusing on her role as a political, scientific and social influencer.

"Overall, a highly entertaining film.","I must start by saying that I love Keira Knightley and I think she is a very talented young actress. In fact, the only reason I really even decided to watch this movie was because she was in it. And she does not disappoint in the Duchess. She plays the role of Georgiana, the duchess of Devonshire, perfectly.. and a lot of the time, even when she is not speaking, her facial expressions tell all. Ralph Fiennes also plays his part very well as the Duke of Devonshire, who only wants a son from the Duchess. At times the Duke may seem cruel, but Fiennes also portrays how he was also human, with feelings deep down inside.The movie is beautiful filmed and the costumes are gorgeous. Even if you don't fall in love with the movie, you will admire the costumes, and the scenery.If you love movies such as Atonement, or Pride & Prejudice, you will most likely enjoy the Duchess.",7.0,Anonymous,History
All I wanted from this film and more,"Okay, so let's put this in context, if you don't like period dramas, don't go and see this movie, you probably won't like it, and it is NOT Diana's story, nothing like although some in the marketing department thought so ...But i love this film, having being dying to see it since the first teaser trailer. I love everything about it the costumes, the characters, the acting, the whole package.Keira Knightley in a corset again, but then i think these are roles she is good at, this role required her to have this real sense of melancholy to her and she did it beautifully.Ralph Fiennes is funny, repulsive and endearing in his role as the duke you feel one thing for him and then another, you can't write this guy off as anything in particular. All i know is that i wouldn't want to be married to him.I hope that both Knightley and Fiennes get their second and third Oscar nominations for this respectively, as they are well made parts.As for the others:Dominic Cooper, is lovely as Grey if perhaps a little underused, Hayley Atwell's character is again one you want to hate but really can't, and Rampling is great as the mother.All in all a great period flick, i say 10/10, but if i wasn't so into this kind of thing i'd probably still rate it quite highly, it is a fine piece of film-making.",10.0,Anonymous,History

"Yes..forget the critics, and enjoy the beauty of THE DUCHESS","THE DUCHESS is a simply beautiful film, with lush English locations and costumes that are out of this world, along with a cast of actors that you can thoroughly enjoy. Ralph Fiennes is at the top of his game as the Duke, and Kira Knightley continues to grow in stature and grace in a role as the Duchess which makes you immediately think of the late and extraordinary Princess Diana. Charlotte Rampling once again graces the screen with a regal air, and Dominic Cooper brings a solid performance as Mr. Grey. And, it is in the cinematography and sets and costumes that brings THE DUCHESS to life and gives it the sheen and polish of that era of opulence and lushness of the Royals. THE DUCHESS, like MARIE ANTOINETTE, serves up a rich piece of elegance, set around a story that makes you want to have a happy ending, but that would be a fairy tale.So, forget/ignore the critics, the soft reviews, and take in the story and intrigue which is THE DUCHESS.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Too hard to get into, and all too easy to walk out of.","The period drama never has been a genre that has offered cinema attendees high octane thrills and pacing, instead opting for a much more subdued, elegant formula to tell whatever historically placed story it may be willing to explore. To say that much of the genre as a result is usually unfairly deemed as dry to the point of uselessness would be somewhat of an understatement; in fact the vast majority of such films, although slow and exceedingly dry, usually make up for their blandness in story with well rounded, memorable and exciting characters. The Duchess however, is not one of these films. No, this is dry turkey with an ostensible glaze created by superficial juice. Going through the motions at every turn, director Saul Dibb fails to create anything worth noting here; it's an extremely straight-forward, standardised period drama with little to no interesting characters whatsoever. So not only do you have to sit through a soap opera plot that feels about as fresh and exciting as seeing Keira Knightley in another period costume, but you have to do so with inane personas that never do anything but pamper about in their big mansions, shouting at their servants. Dull, dreary and utterly disposable, The Duchess is as boring as the genre gets, and while there are some good elements present, they fail to mesh coherently to disguise the fact that the script has no intrinsic value inherent in its thin, formulaic design.To discuss the premise of the movie is almost futile; if you have seen any movies from the genre, you have pretty much seen The Duchess. Revolving around yet another privileged woman who in turn marries a man of prestige and obviously finds out he is interested in her only for the chance to birth an heir, the twists and turns that take place here are stunted and all too obvious. Throw in the ambitious dreamer that whisks the duchess to her dream fantasy land where the sex is just so much better because, well, he's rugged and a little more emotionally viable, and you can see that not much out of the ordinary is set to take place over the next couple of hours. At this point in discussing the story I would normally diverge onto something that works a little better, and yet I can find no opposing tangent to bring up here. Aside from the happy error of making the film's quietened antagonist more empathetic and compelling than the lead woman, The Duchess is straight forward, no risks involved, period drama; all the staples are here and yet never before have they all felt so lifeless, tired and irrelevant.Indeed, in order for such a film to work, one must bridge the massive gap that separates the culture of today with that on the screen. Many of the most memorable movies residing within the genre have managed to do this, but The Duchess never does. Sure enough, the script does well to put character and themes of love and regret in the forefront of focus in order to tell a story of humanity rather than history, yet in direct contrast with this year's much more engaging The Other Boleyn Girl, this outing feels emotionally mundane. Lead actress Keira Knightley is no stranger to these types of features, but unfortunately her whole performance this time feels perfunctory and useless; her character is ruled by emotion to that the point that she is perceived as weak and without reasoning. When you have a central character who asks for sympathy in every scene without doing anything to warrant such a thing, you have a troublesome predicament. As a personality The Duchess of Devonshire is banal and the antithesis of compelling. She never surprises and shows less personality than in her ridiculously fake beauty spot that she sports in one scene. During this sequence I was enraptured by this giant obstruction on Keira's face, and then I remembered where I was. To scream irony at this point would have been befitting.To be sure, there are audiences out there who will eat up this sort of thing for what it is; cheap, seen-it-all-before drama that demands little and offers not much more in exchange. Behind me sat two older women, both of whom I deemed aficionados of the genre going by their hoots and wails during certain scenes that tickled their fancy. Sure enough, I would guess that they at least were entertained, yet I was not. Again, I blame culture difference. And yet with major worldwide successes this year from the likes of Iron Man, Indiana Jones and Batman, one wonders if the period drama will ever manage to draw in the demographic that such movies have thus far managed to do. Going by The Duchess however, which prompts one to believe that things are only getting worse for a genre that is by now churning out the same story time and time again, this potentiality seems unlikely. Perhaps if the historical setting and themes present here were delivered with more poignancy and an overall conviction or sense of modern relevancy, The Duchess could have at least dispelled my apathy towards the genre by the likes of The Other Boleyn Girl. Unfortunately this is not the case; esoteric and emotionally stunted, this movie is too hard to get into, and all too easy to walk out of; only for those who haven't seen a period drama in the last five years.A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)",,Anonymous,History
Lavish Costume Drama,"Kiera Knightley is a familiar face in these period pieces and she's quite wonderful and beautiful as the strong willed but trapped Georgiana. This story is based on fact - she did live in a triad within her marriage but her other personal issues, health and debt come after the story ends. I liked the movie- visually gorgeous with a good cast but perhaps lacking in the writing as I never connected much with the protagonist. Fans of the genre will enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Queen Keira,"Although another movie with Keira Knightley and Donald Sutherland, which was a period piece, was something I didn't like that much. Especially because I thought that the only saving grace of the movie was Donald S., with Keira not being up to the (acting) challenge. Well this movie proves me wrong (to myself).Keira is really great in this movie. She pulls off her role quite well. And it doesn't even matter who her screen-""partner"" is, she is always on top of her game. The story is told quite nicely and even the bit players are great. If you are into period dramas, you will love this anyway, but even for people who haven't watched that many, are going to have an eventful watch. As an extra bonus (if you want to call it that), the movie is based on real events.",7.0,Anonymous,History
What it feels like for a girl,"It seems that with each passing year, there comes a point in time when we will inevitably find the young and beautiful, Keira Knightly, in yet another period drama. It also seems like every period drama these days, whether it features Knightly or not, feels the need to disassociate itself from the conventions of the past and assert itself as fresh, with a unique twist on the genre. This is particularly challenging when the story is one we've seen a number of times prior. The true story of Georgina Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire, as told by director, Saul Dibb, in THE DUCHESS, is one where a young girl of ""modest"" heritage is married off to an esteemed Duke for a price. Her duty is to serve his grace and provide to him a male heir. As a woman, she is nothing more than a decorative commodity and should she not be able to fulfill her wifely promises, then she is essentially useless. Dibb is smart about it though. With the point already made before the film even begins, he chooses to focus instead on the reality of this kind of imprisonment  what it feels like for a girl beneath her binding bodice.Knightly carries the weight of this film on her shoulders while carrying the weight of the wigs on her head with poise and prominence. Her big brown eyes go from playful to shy to distraught and defeated. When we first meet her, she is free and seemingly unaware of the heavier world outside of her backyard games. Before long though, she is face to face with adulthood. This particular face belongs to Ralph Fiennes as the Duke of Devonshire. It is here that Dibb steps in to add another layer to the played out trajectory. With an age difference that is only matched in vastness by the distance between them, the Duke undresses his Duchess and asks why women's clothing must be so complicated. There is no better occasion for small talk than before two practical strangers go to bed for the first time. Knightly, trying desperately to hide her nervousness, replies to the obviously rhetorical question though, claiming that this is the only way for women to express themselves in the times they live in. It is clear she is not sure that a reply is necessary or even allowed but it is also clear that she speaks to ensure that she is seen, that her person is present. Her clothing falls to the floor and the imprints of her corset can still be seen on the smooth of her back.Dibb follows this form of unexpected intimacy and insight with commentary about celebrity and how little the adoring public truly knows about their icons. The Duchess of Devonshire, or at least the one in THE DUCHESS, was an immense influence on her people. Her presence at events guaranteed crowds while her fashion determined the trends. Even her association with particular people could sway public and political opinion. She embodied grace and extravagance while remaining humble and the public ate it up. In their eyes, her life was perfect but those who traveled in closer circles knew better. They knew that there was little love between the Duke and Duchess and increased strain as she was not able to provide a male heir. Even they didn't know just how bad it was though. The wait staff on the other hand could have made millions on a tell-all. Like Stephen Frears' THE QUEEN, Dibb shows us what goes on on both sides of the castle gates, highlighting the drastic disconnect between the two close worlds. The Duchess was made to make many horrific choices and concessions that would have broken many a lesser person. What makes them so harrowing in the context of the film is the plainness with which they are expected by the Duke and subsequently accepted by all involved.THE DUCHESS is shocking on many levels. It is shocking how harsh it is underneath its polished finish and how new this old tale feels. It is shocking how well Knightly can hold her pain and her own. And it is shocking how little value and worth was once afforded the women of the world. But it is perhaps most shocking that the manner in which women were once seen as a male possession, with purpose and function that only serves the male agenda, still exists today, no matter how you dress it up.",9.0,Anonymous,History

The real Georgiana was a dynamic individual very active in the social and political movements of the day, yet here we are provided merely with a cliched and predictable lightweight romantic melodrama. This quality cast is capable of so much more, and yet we're given mostly style but no substance, which really undercuts our ability to empathize with, and feel for the Duchess.

sumptuous visual feast,"""The Duchess"" tells the tale of the beautiful young Georgiana Spencer (Knightley) who, in the late 18th century, is married to the much older Duke of Devonshire (Fiennes) and attains wealth, status, and prestige, all at the price of being condemned to a loveless marriage. It's familiar ground: the duke is the typically phlegmatic English nobleman, unable to express or perhaps even experience emotions, while his wife is in every way his superior: in intellect, courage, self-reliance, devotion to children, etc.Most of the story revolves around the inequality between men's and women's lives: the former openly flaunting their mistresses while the latter are forbidden such dalliances. Men don't come off very well in this movie: they beat their wives, threaten them with separation from their children, and treat their girls with utter indifference while a boy is the ultimate prize.While the plot is not altogether scintillating, the acting more than makes up for it. Knightley is at her best, able to convey all the emotions the role requires. But the star of this movie is Fiennes, who in spite of playing a truly unlikeable character, manages to keep him from being utterly detestable. At the end, his humanity finally breaks through just a little bit, and one wishes the script would have allowed a few more glimmers at earlier points in the movie as well.But even if one were to magically delete all dialogue from the film, and just watch it on the big screen with the soundtrack, it would be well worth it. The constant parade of fashions, primarily women's but also men's, is like a documentary of late 18th century clothing. Each scene seems to outdo the other. It's like walking through a museum full of Gainsborough and Reynolds portraits, and seeing each one come to life; wonderful! The stately mansions, the magnificent teams of horses, the sweeping vistas of gardens and sheep on the pastures, it's all England at its very finest. The soundtrack was beautiful, lush and romantic and very apropos. I particularly liked the inclusion of much period music which was intelligently (though not always accurately) paired with the era. Was Bach played in England in 1775? I rather doubt it, but still it fit nicely and sounded gorgeous.Do see this on the big screen; don't wait for the DVD.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Adored by the public for her extravagant lifestyle, Spencer endured a troubled marriage and was eventually driven into the arms of Charles Grey, a senior Whig politician.

Similar Sagas,"THE DUCHESS (based on Amanda Foreman's book ""Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire"" which in turn was based on historical fact) has been well adapted for the screen by Jeffrey Hatcher, Anders Thomas Jensen and writer/director Saul Dibb. What was basically snubbed by the critics of the theatrical release as a 'fashion show with little else going for it' turns out to be a quite beautiful period drama. The fact that the story is based on the life of the outspoken feminist and political thinker in the late 1700s - Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire - who happens to be an ancestor of Princess Di whose life in many ways paralleled the Duchess, makes it more interesting than most costume dramas. And yet, even without the obvious parallel in stories, this film stands well on its own, due to a smart script and a fine cast.Lady Spencer (Charlotte Rampling) coaxes the marriage of her beautiful daughter Georgiana (Keira Knightley) to marry the very wealthy Duke of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes), a rather boring dog lover whose only interest in 'purchasing' a wife is to gain a male heir. Caught up in the dignity and lush homes and gardens of the Duke, the new Duchess charms all who see her - and the manner in which Keira Knightley wears the vast number of gorgeous sculpted costumes gives credence to her appearance popularity and enhances her personal popularity as she looks beyond the surface to the hearts of the people around her. When the Duchess is unable to produce live boy children (two stillborns don't count, nor do the two daughters she births), The Duke turns to dalliances both with the household maids and to the Duchess' newest friend Lady Bess (Hayley Atwell): the Duchess seeks solace with her childhood love Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper) and the tension in the household comes to a breaking point. British etiquette rules, and the 'wife' must bear up under the pressure of society, a position the Duchess obeys but continues her popularity with the politics and social comments of the times - quite a daring feat for those revolutionary years in England, America, and France and the world in general. How this singularly intelligent woman copes provides the resolution of the story.Keira Knightley is ravishingly beautiful and continues to impress with her sensitive acting skills. The contributions by Ralph Fiennes, Charlotte Rampling, Dominic Cooper and Hayley Atwell bring finely honed characterizations to life. Rachel Portman is responsible for the musical score that fits the production like a glove. There is, then, far more to this film than a panorama of elegant costumes. It is deserving of a larger audience. Grady Harp",8.0,Anonymous,History
Spirited and stylish costume drama with heart and soul.,"A girl of nineteen (Georgiana Spencer Cavendish played by Keira Knightley) is to be married-off to an older titled man (The Duke of Devonshire played by Ralph Fiennes) as a form of provider-of-male-heir business arrangement (brokered by her mother - played by veteran Charlotte Rampling), rather than as a union based on true mutual love.Based - loosely - on a true historical story.(Parallels to the doomed marriage of Diane and Charles being played upon in the marketing and - in my opinion - in some of the acting on-screen!)I am a bit hesitant over costume drama. Too often the thing plays out like a fashion parade with too little moving central drama to keep my eyes from my watch. This isn't too bad, even though the mounting and costumes ARE still the only real prize winners on display. You feel that you are really going back in time. The well preserved mansions of England doing sterling service to the cause.To date this is KK's biggest - and most taxing - dramatic role and she handles it very well. A solid and polished performance without needing to clear her mantelpiece for awards. Although hard to believe that she is - later in the piece - a multiple-times-mother. She would have put on weight to play a rickets victim.Fiennes is better at playing not-very-nice than most actors and here he plays a man with little to no moral fibre. Indeed by today's standards someone for the Sex Offenders Register. Blame his over-privileged background and parents as much as him!Two previous films came to mind while watching: Barry Lyndon and Amadeus. Films with more money to spend and more plot to follow. This does not give the social context of these films although this might diminish sympathy for The Duchess. Who is - at worst - a frustrated and loveless bird kept in a gilded silver cage, rather than living in the disease, filth and poverty that the vast majority of the population had to endure way back then.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A moving story,"Flawless. This is so much more than a pretty costume piece. Yes, there is only one linear plot, but Kiera Knightly takes us so deeply into the story of her character, The Dutchess, that we are completely absorbed.This is no comedy of manners, as we are used to in so many period pieces. This is the story of a girl excited about her future, learning blow by blow what it means to be the wife/property of a powerful man. I was impressed that Kightly was able to portray the pain of her marriage and the deep love of a mother.Ralph Fiennes was perfect as the Duke. A man so used to his own power and privilege that it allowed him to live with no consideration for others. You don't like him, but you do understand him.I saw the love interest of the Dutchess, not in terms of an undeniable passion, but more as an attempt to snatch some shred of joy for herself in a life empty of love. In that respect, it was played convincingly.I am not sure that men will be able to relate to these themes, but women who have been married and have children will have their hearts torn by each painful compromise and decision. Somehow Knightly and/or the director manages to lead us through this tragic tale in a way that is moving instead of depressing.Despite its historical nature, this is not a family film as the sexual themes are for mature audiences.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Powerful,"Fiennes has been a reliable actor since his breakthrough appearance in ""Schindler's List"" a little more than a decade ago. His diabolical Nazi had a complex personality that transcended some of the stereotypical portrayals seen before. For most of last decade, he has continued shining with films like ""The English Patient"" where his romantic sensibility permeates the entire movie. ""The Duchess"" proves once again the caliber of his acting. Here, the technical details are flawless, but it is how he reaches into the soul of the character that dazzles us. He inhabits the role, bringing out every possible facet and detail. The portrayal of the duke leaves no room for doubt or questions. The man was the human embodiment of power, and he commanded respect and fear, never fully understanding how he had to make his moves. Yet he knew that handling this power could have enormous repercussions on his political, social, and personal lives, and the burden was at times unbearable. Fiennes shows this man had the ability to deal with, but he knew it was important to show that his actions and consequences did affect him, too.The movie is supposed to be a portrayal of the woman who married this iconic figure, and Knightley shows she keeps growing as an actress. It could be argued that Fiennes would need an acting partner who could do this magnificent dance with him, giving a performance that was solid and interesting. Knightley does just that, going beyond the costumes to explore how being a woman during this period was not an easy task, even when she had advantages that other members of her sex could only dream of. However, did she have the control she thought she had? This is the aspect the movie explores, and with both of these actors, it is possible to take a peek into this historical period.The film is elegant, gorgeously produced, with a lavish score that highlights the emotions of the main characters. Fiennes imposes plenty of restrictions on his actions because of the expectations society puts on him. Her other half is the emotive one and he knows he needs a partner like that, going beyond his initial design for his wife. They make an excellent couple and a great partnership. If only things were this easy...There is much to admire in this interesting recreation of a period and a society that has changed quite a bit. The best thing about the movie is again how wonderful Fiennes is, and how the film revolves around him, even though there is much to enjoy by watching Knightley bring the legendary woman to life. It ia all about what is being allowed during a period in time, about who is able to execute that power discreetly enough to retain the mystique, the respect and the necessary authority that has kept these people at the top of their elite. It is a delicate balance, and the film allows you some insight.It is a good movie, come, sit, and learn that not everything was pleasure for people like the duke and his wife.",,Anonymous,History
Does not harm anybody but it will not surprise as well,"The Duchess is a nice movie, which tells us something about the Duchess of Devonshire. I was engaged, how realistic are kept all the traditions, especially etiquette, which were sometimes funny to me (for example the standing up and sitting on chairs). Unfortunately the film became after the first hour predictable and monotonous; love stories appear either from Georgiana or from the duke. It seemed to me that the director has forgotten about other events which could possibly happen. Very interesting are also the actor/ actress performances: Keira Knightley has done (as always) a great job, but I was “captured” by Ralph Fiennes, who represented strangeness and distance.

The location filming in London at Devonshire House, Chatsworth and Bath are sumptuous. Devonshire House has been rebuilt since the 1920's however Chatsworth is reputed to be very similar today to the period in question as are parts of Bath.

Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com November, 2008.OVERVIEW:As the movie opens, 17-year-old Georgiana Spenser (Knightley) is playfully teasing Charles Grey (Cooper), the budding politician who is smitten with her and remains so for the rest of the film. In the meantime, her status-conscious mother (Rampling) is arranging her marriage to William Cavendish, The Duke of Devonshire (Fiennes), a boorish nabob whose only obsessions are his dogs and his desire to produce a male heir. Once married, the young Duchess is treated like chattel and only receives husbandly attention as it relates to acquiring a son. Nevertheless, her irrepressible spirit and inherent wit propel her to notoriety among London's liberal elite. She supports the American and French Revolutions and is an ardent campaigner for Whig politicians such as future Prime Minister Charles Fox (McBurney). She also turns out to be a gifted fashion designer, one who wears dresses today that others will wear tomorrow. But she lives in an age where women have few rights, and this sets the stage for the kinds of conflicts that are a playwright's delight.REVIEW: 3 out of 4 Java MugsFrom a leather-clad warrior-queen in King Arthur to a skinny soccer star in Bend it Like Beckham, Keira Knightley has dazzled her way through centuries of British history. And she is only 23. With her recent period pieces Pride & Prejudice and Atonement, one might declare: ""Oh no, not another costumer with Keira!""But this one is different (and just as good), because the compelling story involves real people, including the title character who is an ancestor of Diana Spenser, the late Princess of Wales. In fact, the plight of the 18th century Georgiana echoes that of 20th century Diana: a young girl marries a much older blue-blood with disastrous results. And, remember that play you read in English class, The School for Scandal? The marriage satirized by Richard Brinsley Sheridan is that of his contemporaries, the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire.The casting is dead-on. In addition to Knightley, who is near-perfect, Atwell is beguiling as the Duke's ""other wife,"" while Fiennes manages to maintain interest in a character with few redeeming qualities. The supporting roles provide additional richness, including Rampling's ambitious matron, McBurney's insinuating Fox, and McArdle's subversive Sheridan. Least satisfying is Cooper as Earl Grey, the future Prime Minister (who had a tea named after him). Inspired costuming along with Britain's best castles and estates are put to good use to take the audience back in time.Princess Diana may bring in the audiences, but they will stay for Georgiana.",7.0,Anonymous,History
a timeless tragedy,"A powerful film and a wonderful yet bittersweet period piece. The Duchess tells the story of a woman trying to be free in a time when freedom was impossible. It's heart wrenching and sweet at the same time but also has a tragic undertone to it.
Accompanied by a stunning soundtrack, set on the beautiful backdrop of 18th century Devonshire, Keira Knightley pulls off one of the best performances in her career. An emotional and moving account of one young woman's struggle for a place in society, but more importantly a place in the heart of a man.",9.0,Anonymous,History
The Duchess,"I disagree with the critics in that this film is a perfect glimpse of this period in English history. Not only did it catch my attention and interest from the outset, but it held it. Both Ms. Knightly and Mr. Fiennes were perfect in their roles. Bravo to the casting director! If you're into English history, this film should be on your ""must see list."" It's almost like going back in time and being able to observe what it must have been like during this period. If you like costumes, pomp and circumstance, you'll enjoy ""The Duchess."" Although the story may have its slow moments, the grandeur of the setting, the costumes and the acting make up for what's lacking. Get thee to your local theater -- go and enjoy!",8.0,Anonymous,History
The Duchess,"In theory, a more sophisticated period drama based on the true story of Georgiana (Keira Knightley), an aristocrat married off to a loveless marriage with the enormously wealthy and politically influential Duke of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes). She is treated little better than a brood mare in fancy dress but has way to much independent spirit to settle for that and is soon having an affaire de coeur with Dominic Cooper ""Earl Grey"" (yes, he of the tea...). Meantime, the Duke has taken a mistress and so the film depicts how our multiple ménages-à-trois work out. It very much emphasises the (very) limited choices of women in 18th Century Britain - regardless of their status - but unfortunately, save for a few brief appearances by Charlotte Rampling - the characterisations were way too sterile for me. It is a great looking costume drama, though - some of the finest stately homes shown off to their best effect but in the end it was much more style than substance.",6.0,Anonymous,History
The book is much better.,"Having read the book that this film is based upon my expectations were high although I thought that the short running time could not possibly do justice to the 450 pages of the book, and I was not wrong. It barely skimmed the massive detail contained in the book and was a big let down for me. It was beautifully made with seemingly no expense spared on costumes or locations but to give one example no mention was made of the huge gambling debts run up by the Duchess, which was of course a major problem for her. The author of the book must have been severely disappointed as after seeing this poor film few would want to read her excellent book assuming it to be as bad as the film.",3.0,Anonymous,History
BBC is so clever,"Once again the British show how a costume drama is to be made. Every detail in furniture, fashion and hair is perfect. Much of the acting is made through eyes and gestures. So very clever indeed.This is about the duchess who marries an emotional desert. Not strange according to the times and her class, but she starts to oppose it in a rebel way. It becomes more of a rebellion than is suitable to the times and the surroundings.And the actors get much out of this rather limited problem. You start to care about this poor aristocrat and once again there are proves of class issues never being the only platform for a drama. It's irrelevant, if it hasn't got living people in it.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Beautiful but slow.,"Went to see this with the promise of Dominic Cooper *licks picture* and a period drama.I was not disappointed on either count, but something made it move incredibly slow, and seem incredibly long-winded, when it didn't have to be. However, it redeemed itself by being visually stunning. Some of the symmetry was breath-taking and setting was gorgeous. Very pretty :D.Enjoyable, not boring in any way, but just a little slow for my liking.I was a little surprised at the 12A certificate though. I think my glasses steamed up on several occasions :P Far too lewd for people under the age of 12 ^^ or maybe that's just me being prudish.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Dutches Not Bad,"I went to see this movie with my friends not knowing what to expect (I hadn't seen any previews). I enjoyed it, however. It was well put together, and the costumes and cinematography were top-notch. Keira Knightley delivers a wonderful performance; not over-the-top. She is clearly a smart actress and makes many great decisions about her character -- there's a certain sensibility to the way she interprets the duchess. The story itself is not as interesting as I would have liked -- not too original, and nothing that I haven't seen before. But the production value and performances are good enough to carry the film.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Another tale of misogyny,I literally would have thrown that man down a flight of stairs or at least his live in mistress. Back then: no cctv no forensics or dna just me behind going down the stairs with my foot in the small of his or back. I spent the film imagining all the ways I could have done away with him and his mistress and got away with back in those days. I would have thought women would have stuck together rather than stabbing each other in the back. But very well acted and the scenery is lavish. Very good film.,10.0,Anonymous,History
.. like they say.. doesn't always bring happiness,"Boy, did this gal ever have it coming at her from all directions.. the royal (pita) husband.. mom.. and then finally her 'best friend.' Then she has to go pick someone not just to jump-bones.. but has to go and fall in love with a guy's got no resources..(and ya know what she's going to have to deal with the hubby).

Underrated and Brilliant,"It seems to be a common consensus on here that this film was unfairly savaged by the critics. I have to agree.I expected nothing from this due to the hideous revues it had received. However, when it was on the TV recently I gave it a try.Simply marvellous. I was hooked from the beginning. Sumptuous sets and really good acting from Keira and Mr Fiennes as usual. What a bastard ! I would have shot him if I was his wife. There were plenty of guns and swords around his house.I couldn't fail to compare it with similar snore fests like Age of Innocence and Dangerous Liaisons which bored from point one, and never achieved what they did here, and both of those films were critically received.",,Anonymous,History
A Duchess's progress,"Just another bodice-ripping costume drama...? Well, perhaps, but this latest entrant into a historically crowded field has such a strong narrative (based on a true story, so the legend has it), that taking into account the customary high production values this type of film usually engenders, the final result is a quality movie, with contemporary resonance as issues of child access, infidelity, class division, male-dominated relationship issues and a little bit of celebrity populism and more are presented for our delectation.The high-society-at-play opening on the lawns of England is merely the entrée to the more serious sport of class politics as aspirant mother Charlotte Rampling thrusts her innocently ambitious 17 year old daughter Keira Knightley into an arranged marriage with the older, colder Duke of Devonshire, old dour-face Ralph Fiennes, rich beyond belief and a major power in contemporary Whig politics whose sole expectation of his new bride is to sire a son to prolong his family line.Knightley's and to a lesser extent Fiennes' characters' stormy progress from this starting point to a sort of understood peace at the end is effectively the story in a nutshell, taking in, as it does, the affairs of subsidiary characters who cross their paths, like the Duchess's soul-mate, Lady Bess who will go to any lengths, including the bedroom, to win the Duke's influence in getting her infant sons returned to her from her in-possession separated husband and aspirant young politician, later Prime Minister, Charles Gray, the Duchess's ardent admirer from her youth who remains her passion in adulthood plus other contemporary historical figures like Whig Prime Minister Fox and Restoration playwright Sheridan, always making appearances at some grand ball or somesuch. The point where Knightley's character realises she must make the same sacrifice for her children's welfare that she decried her friend earlier in the piece is the nexus of the film.Knightley is very good as the young ingénue who learns the hard way, despite a native intelligence, just how little prepared she is for her deep-end entry into the man's world of Regency England. Fiennes' journey of self-exploration is shorter, but hints at the later concessions society would make to legitimate feminine demands in marriage as well as society as a whole.Interior and exterior shots are beautifully set and lit. Many shots are well-composed including variations on the almost clichéd long-table shot of breakfasting husband and wife not communicating with each other. Ditto the costumes and particularly the extravagant hair-do's of the women of the day! I did however find the background music not always redolent of the era and so all-embracing that you often got the impression that a string quartet was playing just off-camera in almost every scene. Too much of a good thing.A bitter-sweet tale then of female/motherly sacrifice which ends, rightly, on the side of the angels.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A nice looking costume drama.,"The Duchess was advertised on the back of a very controversial advertising campaign, using Georgiana Cavendish's famous relative Princess Diana as a part of the marketing campaign. Despite this The Duchess is a decent, if standard costume drama.Georgiana Cavendish (Keira Knightley) is an intelligence young woman from noble stock. At a young age she marries the much older man the Duke of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes), one of the most powerful peers in the House of Lords and a wealthy landowner. She only marries him so that she could bore him a son. There marriage is complex, the Duke is cold and distance to his wife, particularly when she has daughters and he has affairs, including with Lady Bess Foster (Hayley Atwell), Georgiana's best friend. But Georgiana becomes a major figure in England, being a fashion idol and a major supporter of the Whigs (in very loose terms Liberal) party. She is an idealist and she forms a close relationship with politician Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper).I first thing I had to say is The Duchess is a very beautiful looking film. The costumes are grand and wonderful to look at. I'm sure there was a great amount of research and love and care from designer Michael O'Conner (who deserved his Academy Award). The Art Direction was also of a high end and there was a lot of detail put into this film. They wanted to get the feel for the period. The director Saul Dibb seemed to be influenced by Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon with the amount of candle light shots and wonderful historical settings in Bath and the countryside. Dibb did a good job trying to keep a good pace and there solid attempt to make an interesting film.There is a good cast and Keira Knightley is growing as an actress. She has proved her talent in Pride and Prejudice and Atonement and she gives a really strong and believable and her range was tested. She is becoming the biggest name young costume actress around. Fiennes was good as always playing a emotionally distance man who only cared about himself. But we do not get to know much about him and is really much there in him. Many of the to other performances were typical and decent in a costumer drama and many of the characters are the usual characters that you would find. Charlotte Rampling has an interesting character as both Georgiana's best friend and the Duke of Devonshire's lover in what is a very complex relationship.There are big ideas and themes in the film. The phase 'there were three people in our marriage' is taken to a new extreme with Georgiana having to life with the woman having an affair with her hubby. For politics and history nuts there is plenty to sink your teeth into with Georgiana becoming a major political campaigner for the Whigs and reform and even more surprising considering women did not have any say. Political ideas and philosophy were discussed in the film. Sexual politics was also a major theme in the film, showing the hypocrisy of the age that it was of for a man to have a mistress because it was the done but it was social suicide for woman to have affair. The Duchess also show that marriages in the aristocracy were made for political reasons and ensure that a land owner could give their land to a son: not love. If a landowner gave their land to a daughter then the people their married would inherit all the land. No many how intelligence a woman was men still held all the power and influence in the land.I also have to praise Rachel Portman's string based score, which was fitting music for the time.But as strong as film as the Duchess is, it does not do anything that stretches the genre.",7.0,Anonymous,History

A decent soap opera,"This is a decent enough film, but I guess I expected more in the way of historical context and social contrast.In Duchess we have a few very rich people acting mostly in accordance with the dictates of their time and class. If the spirit of revolution is in the air it hasn't reached them yet. Duchess is something like ""Dr. Zhivago"" without the Revolution-- basically just a soap opera.I was disappointed with the heroine's choice between children and love. I thought the plot would take off at that point. I was expecting... what? Anna Karenina? Duchess is Anna Karenina Lite. Very lite.Don't know why I have the Russians on my mind.

I thought at first Keira was a bit too theatrical, but she continues really really well I think. In the end ... I didn't know why I haven't liked it better. Was it the acting? was it the script? well, in the end, I thought it was just how it was all put together, too slow for the duchess character who seemed more fiery then the film is, the love affair but where exactly was the love, why did it end and it seemed nothing really had happened.some weeks later I saw it again, and this time I felt better and I think I know why it doesn't click at full potential, unfortunately.

Not a bad movie,"Kind of an overdrawn costume drama.The problem with most historical films or books is that they impose a modern sensibility to the character's plight. In our modern, post-feminist world, the plight of Georgina, Duchess of Devonshire, seems quite absurd. Her husband can have a mistress, openly display her in front of all to see, but if she takes a lover in secret, it is a great scandal for which she is severely penalized. To us, this seems quite unreasonable, but at the time, people dealt with it.This takes place in the period of revolution in America and France, but it seems (much like Sophia Coppola's ""Marie Antonnete"", history is something that happens to other people. These folks are too busy with their own soap operas.The costumes and sets are very nice, and BBC productions have come a long way in production values since the 1970's, where shows like ""I Claudius"" or ""The Wives of Henry the Eigth"" were clearly shot on sound stages on the cheap.

"Interesting idea, spoiled in the telling","The British have long been known for top-notch period dramas: the lovely clothes, the palatial homes, every detail of food and drink and music spot-on. So far so good. But how did the director manage to turn a rattling good political/social story set at a time of great unrest in all of Europe and slow it down to a trudge through the sludge?Perhaps part of it was the camera work, particularly all those shots through windows that ""just happen"" to blur the one thing the viewer needs to see? Or the terrible sound, which allows us hear every footstep and slurp of wine, but always blurs the dialogue at its most vital point? The needless implied lesbian sex scene? Or simply the wooden performances on the part of all the actors? Shoddy directing, shoddy writing--of course it got an Oscar.To be honest, for a story where so much might have happened not a lot goes on.Longest 98 minutes I've sat through in a long time.",3.0,Anonymous,History
"Suffer, suffer, suffer","I wonder if I will be considered as having written a spoiler if I hereby give away the whole ""plot"": The duchess suffers. Then she suffers again. A little while later, she suffers some more. That's it. I enjoyed watching this movie in a passive sort of way for the beautiful architecture and interiors and the ravishing costumes. But there is no drama and no characterisation. The duchess is first a naive girl, then a spirited girl. The duke is a cold, selfish bastard. That's it. You can feel sorry in a detached sort of way for the duchess, but since the whole movie does it seems superfluous for the viewer to do so as well.The script is not embarrassing, but neither is it very ingenious, and in several places the modern sensibility beneath the surface bursts out in the form of anachronisms typical of our age of self-aggrandisement.",,Anonymous,History
"A good period film, visually magnificent, but with several flaws from the point of view of accuracy and historical rigor.","Georgiana Cavendish, born Spencer, was one of the most interesting, remarkable and charismatic personalities in British society at the end of the 18th century. She made an enviable marriage, for the period, by marrying the 5th Duke of Devonshire, one of the richest and most powerful British peers. However, they had nothing in common: the duke was a man of few words and saw marriage as a means to an end: to have a legitimate male heir. Georgiana, on the other hand, was not content to be just a decorative figure or a child-bearer. Unhappy, she found herself so lonely that she decided to accept the sexual affair that her husband started with her best friend, Lady Foster, who moves in to their house and has adulterous children with him, in a humiliating ""ménage à trois"" which the Duchess supports in exchange for the friendship of Lady Foster, on whom she becomes emotionally dependent. To this day, the moral attitude of both women is debatable, and also the extent to which Lady Foster didn't seek, from the beginning, to replace Georgiana, whom she envied and befriended in equal measure.For the rest, we know that the three elements of this love triangle were not faithful, keeping, each one for himself, other affairs and sexual engagements outside this arrangement. When the Duchess became pregnant by one of her lovers, the much younger Charles Gray, she was forced to travel to France, where she gave birth, maintaining for the rest of her life a close but discreet relationship with her adulterous daughter. Upon returning to London, Georgiana changed: by accepting her conjugal situation, she began to look for a series of escapes and distractions that would make her existence bearable: her presence at parties and balls made her a fashion icon, and her support for the Whig Party influenced the course of British politics at the time. The hapless Georgiana developed a ruinous gambling addiction, perhaps depression and even an eating disorder, factors that greatly contributed to her rapid decline in health. She died early, with many debts, many admirers and some literary works published.All this is the short story of this intriguing historical figure. The film, directed by Saul Dibb and starring Keira Knightley, takes a very light approach to her life, and sometimes fails to be faithful to historical facts (warning), even though it delights us visually. In fact, the production values are high, and the highlight is clearly the detailed and well-made costumes, and the sets, many of them handpicked from the most luxurious palatial interiors, capable of instantly transporting us to the time. And context. Also, the cinematography and filming work were well done, as well as the soundtrack, signed by Rachel Portman, is very good, making good use of various pieces of baroque music. The biggest negative criticism I feel I have to make is the editing work, which makes us waste a lot of time on minor details, causing the film to take on an uneven pace. The sense of time passing was not done properly either: we never quite understand the passage of years, since the characters don't age and nothing changes.As for the cast, I think it's fair to congratulate Keira Knightley's work. The actress already has a long history of period films and seems to have developed a certain predilection for this type of dramatic work, so I felt quite comfortable with the role and the character. The way she played opposite and related to Ralph Fiennes is very good, and the actor is excellent in the way he assumes the reserved, distant and sometimes rude ways of the duke, whom she makes an unpleasant and morally controversial figure. Hayley Atwell was also very good in the role of Lady Foster, although she was not able to give the character the moral nuances and ambiguity that the historical character deserved to have. The film also has good minor appearances from Charlotte Rampling and Simon McBurney. Dominic Cooper did what he could in the role of Charles Gray, but I couldn't help but think the actor was too old for the character, who was several years younger than the Duchess.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A Nutshell Review: The Duchess,"The trailers had tried to market this as drawing some parallels to the late Princess of Wales Diana Spencer's life, given the subject matter being a lady of royal lineage being subjected to a loveless marriage which comes complete with affairs and scandals. It had even superimposed her portrait on the trailer to suggest a deja-vu of history, given that the story here is based on real people and presenting a dramatized snapshot of their lives. Until of course Keira Knightley had to stand up and say that this movie tells its own story without the need for such cheap promotional gimmick.But frankly, the life of the Georgina, Duchesss of Devonshire (Keira Knightley) in late 18th century England, couldn't be anything less than similar in certain ways, if based on Amanda Foreman's biography which formed the basis for the film. At a young age and to the delight of her mother (Charlotte Rampling), the Duke of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes) proposes a sealing of families through marriage, where his sole concern is to have a male heir. He wastes no time in impregnating his young wife, and treats her nothing more than a baby- producing factory, given a girl baby after girl baby, in addition to stillborns and miscarriages.It's also a sign of the times where women have no rights, and are expected to perform their duty, of being a wife and mother, which also translates to having no say to what their husbands are doing. For the Duke, it means spending a lot more time with his dogs with no effort in communicating with a factory worker, and being the sex addict that he is, takes pleasure in bedding chambermaids within his castle, or even the Duchess' good friend Bess Foster (Hayley Atwell), who succumbs to trading her body for powerful influences in order to see her children, taken away by her estranged husband.As with most period dramas, it's a tussle between duty and love, and affairs of the heart. While the Duke's dalliances have taken a toil on his marriage, given that the Duchess one headstrong woman, we slowly see her relent and slide into resignation of her fate, but not before trying to perform a tit-for-tat with her lover, future Prime Minister Charles Grey. From the slate of movies in the period drama genre, it seems that such stories are becoming quite popular to be translated to the big screen, and I recall Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette, who was betrothed in similar circumstances just across the English Channel.Keira Knightley stars in yet another period drama, and she's quite an old hand at it already, which no doubt translates to her delivering her best performance thus far in the genre. She presents the pain of living a lie quite convincingly, having to put on a front in public, while behind the scenes get surprise after surprise at the revelation of her husband's true character. Ralph Fiennes seemed to be quite stoic this time round with nary an emotion, and given he is Voldermott, has no difficulty in playing the bastard of a character, using his influence and power for his personal gratitude, making no negotiations to wanting things his way. In fact, one wonders men in high positions back then, could get away with a lot of things, and their wield of influence no doubt carries a lot of weight.The Duchess doesn't present its themes in depth, and sought instead to have breadth in covering a broad range of topics, from social standing to England during the cusp of elections, and while it certainly has no lack of material to last its run time, it certainly hinges on its big name stars to carry the film on their collective shoulders. It's a very straight forward film, like watching the life and times of someone unfold in chronology, and those looking for some satisfying, compelling drama with deep tussles involving heart and soul, might want to look elsewhere instead. Nothing fancy here, but it works.",8.0,Anonymous,History

"A snobs' picnic, methinks","Call me obtuse, but I will never understand the fascination so many people experience when confronted with the lifestyle and behavior of the so-called nobility, one of the worst species of parasite on our blighted planet. This movie concerns, by and large, the antics of a 'duke', equipped with more money than sense, whose main interests in life seem to be young women (preferably naked in bed) and dogs. Predictably, his young, naive and perhaps not terribly bright wife is the victim of the duke's callous, capricious behavior, and, in spite of some attempts to assert her trodden-upon dignity, she is finally discomfited in the end: a bit like Winston Smith in the last chapter of Orwell's '1984'. The playwright and the director have missed a unique opportunity to highlight the obscene contrast between the majority of the British population and their idle, parasitical and cruel 'aristocracy'. Worse still, peasants and the urban working class are occasionally shown while wildly cheering 'progressive' candidates to a general election when these pussyfoot around, promising some vaguely-worded 'reforms'. How the undeserving class known as aristocracy could be (and alas, still can be) respected and generally admired, will always remain a complete mystery to me.",5.0,Anonymous,History

"Beautiful, charming movie.  Bravo to Keira Knightley.","Move over Scarlet O' Hara. Here comes Georgina Cavendish, bringing with her enough emotional baggage to overload a convoy of ships, in an intriguing and engaging period piece movie. Keira Knightley is superb as the heroine Georgina and Ralph Fiennes gives a commanding performance as Georgina's emotionally frigid husband, Lord Devonshire, who must have a son. This movie grabs and keeps the audience's attention and provides a glimpse of what life must have been like for the English aristocracy in the late 18th century. But the central character of this movie is always Georgina as she negotiates the rough waters of a loveless marriage and the infidelity that follows. Georgina is wonderful, she is heroic, she is persevering, she is of nobility yet is a champion of the people and a character who the audience can like and even love. Keira Knightley's performance does full justice to the life and times of Georgina Cavendish, and the story reminds us that despite their wealth and titles, the English nobility were people too.",10.0,Anonymous,History
It Doesn't Get Any Better Than This,"Despite the flack on this film being compared with the exploits of Lady Diana,Princess of Wales, I found this a most fulfilling piece of period cinema. Anyone who gets their groove on (or ever got their groove on)with any of the Merchant/Ivory adaptations of English costume dramas from the 1980's will certainly be knocked head over heels here. Saul Dibb has crafted a finely told tale of an arranged marriage destined to be a bad one. Keira Knightley absolutely shines as Georgiana Spencer (who was,in fact was to be a far distant cousin to Lady Di),Duchess of Devonshire. Ralph Fiennes, as the Duke manages to pull down yet another winning portrait of a cold,loveless,womanizing bastard with no feeling for anyone for himself & his dogs.

Ralph And Keira.,"There is much to be said for the acting here. Ralph Fiennes, and Keira Knightley are so genuine as the Duke and Duchess. The movie has strong characters and beautiful sets. The cinematography is to be admired. The history in the story is a bit less than it was in real life. The Duchess was an ardent gambler. This was not added to the story. Apparently she was in lots of debt. However, given the current climate regarding gambling and the adds everywhere, I'm not surprised it was not made part of the movie. It's a good movie, apart from Dominic Cooper, who, in my opinion, faced with Keira Knightley, is unable to act his way out of a diaper.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent period drama,We went to the NZ premiere last night at the Lido and thoroughly enjoyed this. Knightly isn't my favourite actress but I must admit that she carries this. I hadn't realised her face was so expressive and she appeared to handle the role with ease. Fiennes as the Duke was also excellent and in keeping with what I have read about the Duke's character. And there is a wee hotty for those who need it. My only disappointment was that the movie used sex a bit too much to gloss over some difficulties but overall whomever watches it will gather some understanding of the standards and life of an 18th century man or woman. And probably have a lot of sympathy for the footmen. What a boring life!,8.0,Anonymous,History
"Very flat, Norfolk","Yes, Keira looks good in costume dramas. Just because she's so un-busty we like to see her bones squeezed in corsets. The contrast makes old viands taste more contemporary. But at the eleventh period piece in a row the Knightley effect is losing its sting fast, and however nuanced her acting may have become in the process - dashing with poise - this spice alone can't cover the staleness of the product. For the enduring vitality of a period piece - as of any other movie, but more than most genres - rests ultimately on the screenplay, not on the star appeal or the production values, and ""The Duchess"" is no exception. The sheer fact that its subject is taken from life - a biography, in fact - and not based on one of those immortal Austenian novels already studded with witty lines, which would stand any treatment and still sound fresh, should have advised on some extra writing effort, but the authors thought otherwise. They seem to have believed that putting Sheridan, the Duchess of Devonshire - the most admired literate beauty of Georgian society - and her lover, a future Whig Prime Minister, together into some Adam interior would have produced instant wit, and dispensed with literally putting it in the script. Unluckily for us, it proved not to be so. Poor Georgiana, a chatty character we must presume, and a writer in her own right, is always left with nothing to say or to do, but sobbing, inhaling, glancing and - yes - pouting. Even the usually infallible charm of English buildings and landscapes suffers severely from the general lack of character: the countryside is shapeless, neither sunny nor cloudy, hour and season are nondescript, and Palladian architecture looks wearisome and predictable - you can't endlessly revisit the staircase of Holkham Hall throughout the movie and escape boredom. The overall impression is that of a comedy of manners staged by the National Trust, a well-meaning stint at reliving the splendours of centuries past - coaches, valets, hounds and wigs for the benefit of tourists: the whole ""Georgian experience"" - in some stately mansion from which life has been drained away long time ago.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Not a Duchbag of a film!,"Costume period dramas are a constant bore so why should I spend my time unclothing this one literally style. Because ""The Duchess"" is a pretty good one I must say your highnesses. Keira Knightley stars as Georgiana, the Duchess of the Duke of Devonshire in the 18th Century. However, this Duke and Duchess are not the happy aristocratic couple as they do tend to verbally duke it out from time to time. In fact, they are both opposite ends of the spectrum. Georgiana is charismatic, humorous, and enchanting; while the Duke is lifeless, demanding, and egotistical. His only concern with the Duchess is for her to labor a son to be his heir. When the Duchess can only deliver junior duchesses and no mini-Dukes, the Duke chaos follows. Not to mention, the Duchess longs for a charming politician named Charles Grey, but the Duke makes it very difficult for the Duchess to fall into The Grey Zone. Director Saul Dibb does not dibble dabble too much with the same ol' period piece plot. Dibb does a stellar job in characterizing the protagonists so the focus is not primarily focused on the usual elaborate art direction and whopping costumes of most period pieces. Not to say Dibb did not have some help in accomplishing this by hatching out handsomely to Screenwriter Jeffery Hatcher appealing script of the film. Knightley's commanding performance as Georgiana was of extraordinaire reign. Keira is quickly becoming the acting queen of the period piece genre. Ralph Fiennes was pitch perfect as El Duque. And there were some nice thespian supporting touches by Charlotte Rampling as Georgiana's selfish mother Lady Spencer (for hire to have her daughter marry the Duke), and Dominic Cooper as the aforementioned Charles ""Not in Charge"" Grey. So my concluding exclamation is that ""The Duchess"" is one surprising period film that makes its mark! **** Good",8.0,Anonymous,History
Battling Nature In Her Heart,"Saul Dibb's 'The Duchess' is very much a typical English costume drama. The focus here is on the Duchess of Devonshire, Georgiana's marriage to the Duke and her affair with Charles Grey. Dibb's depiction of the marriage is what engages the viewer most. How this loveless marriage costs Georgina her friend, love and, in the end, her freedom is executed effectively on film. However, some of the subplots were underdeveloped, like the romance between Georgina and Charles and Georgina's political influence. The dialogues are well written with wit and sarcasm.The art direction deserves special mention. The set designs, interior decorations, scenery, makeup and costumes are stunning. The background score, though pleasant to the ears, can be intrusive at times. The cinematography and lighting are brilliant.Keira Knightley does a fine job. Even though I don't think she's physically the most suitable actress for the role (because of her extreme thinness), her acting here is much better than her usual performances. Ralph Fiennes is outstanding as the quietly powerful duke who knows he has the marriage under his control and will do anything he can to keep Georgina within his confines. At the same time he does seem to feel some sadness for the damage he has caused her. Hayley Atwell too does a superb job as the manipulative yet sympathetic and loyal Bess. Dominic Cooper is the one who delivers a poor performance.Overall, 'The Duchess' is a decent costume drama that is stunning to look at. I would have liked it more had the focus of the main story also expanded on Georgina's political influence.",,Anonymous,History
Knightley and Fiennes give the performances of their careers.,"Before viewing 'The Duchess' I was expecting another period drama with all the usual scenarios and clichés.I was greatly mistaken.'The Duchess' gives us a very personal insight into the marriage of The 18th Century Duke and Duchess of Devonshire.Keira Knightley is astounding as Georgianna the Duchess of Devonshire. She gives a raw, emotional performance showing her struggle against the constraints of her marriage and what is expected of her in society, which moved me deeply.Ralph Fiennes plays the Duke perfectly as a cold and quite frankly despicable man. Yet despite the many nasty things he does to Georgianna he still manages to portray a slight vulnerability - that he too is not free.Hayley Atwell, Charlotte Rampling and Dominic Cooper are all on top of their game and add even more depth to the story.The costumes and sets are fantastic and the score is beautiful; it really tugs at your heart.A wonderfully touching drama, which everybody should watch. I doubt you'll be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"An underrated gripping, tragic, true must see tale","Unfortunately, The Duchess appears to be quite an underrated film considering the gripping tragic true tale it offers.The film tells the tale of Georgianna as an innocent young lady who's mother insists for her to be married to the Duke of Devonshire. Dragged into to this new world where she is pressured to produce a male heir by her new unloving husband, her personal life and political take a drastic turn.Georgianna is portrayed convincingly enough by Keira Knightly, although perhaps begging for an Oscar at times, she manages to perform the full emotions the young Duchess experiences with enough heart. Ralph Fiennes portrays the Duke of Devonshire, although not required to do or say much, he possesses enough substance to bring a sense of presence to his character for the audience to feel angered by his callous behaviour.Enter Dominic Cooper and Hayley Atwell playing Charles Grey and Bess Foster. Grey being an old acquaintance of Georgianna for whom she has always had a soft spot and Bess being Gerogianna's new best friend. Both actors play their part well, particularly look at for Atwell's portrayal as Bess to which she plays it with enough kindness in her heart and good intentions despite her devious streak.The film offers convincing actors and beautiful costumes as well as a gripping plot that is clearly well paced for enough time for us to get to know he characters, relate to them and most of importantly care about Georgianna's life. The fact its a true story makes the film more saddening at times which adds to the human drama and emotion for the viewer.Overall a excellent underrated period piece that will play with your emotions and leave you more than satisfied by the end.",,Anonymous,History

Knightley and Fiennes are spellbinding,"Normally, I'm not a huge fan of biopics, but I took a gander at this one because of the presence of my all time favorite actor, Ralph Fiennes, and the most talented young actress of her generation in Keira Knightley. Featuring two very strong leads, outstanding tech, and a gripping script, The Duchess is a spellbinding film that showcases a ton of talent and really knows how to show off.Following the incredibly emotional and true story of Georgiana Spencer Cavendish, Duke of Devonshire and distant relative of Princess Diana of Wales. Georgiana's struggle through betrayal, lies, deception, and her careful walking the line between ""loyalty and personal gratitude"" is chronicled over the course of ten years from her life.Our main actors here are no strangers to the roles they are playing. Knightley returns to the powerful period piece genre that gave her an Oscar nomination a few years back and even more acclaim in last year's ""Atonement"", while Fiennes is at his best playing yet another memorable villain. Knightley's gripping, powerful, and incredibly strong portrayal of one of the strongest characters ever depicted on film is spellbinding. I knew Knightley was a sight to behold in the looks department, but her ability to almost 'seduce' her audience into loving her character is uncanny and unrivaled right now in the business. The conviction and strength of her performance and character is worth the price of admission alone. Fiennes, known as one of the best villainous actors of all time, throws away the mantles of Amon Goeth, Francis Dolarhyde, and Lord Voldemort for his newest masterpiece, the calm, silent, mysterious, and ultimately disturbing Duke of Devonshire. I don't want to say he is frightening, but at the same time, I couldn't help but become frightened as to what he might do when events in the film didn't go in his favor. His deadly quiet delivery of some of the most cruel lines you've heard will leave your blood cold in your veins.The supporting cast features Dominic Cooper as future UK prime minister Charles Grey, Charlotte Rampling as Georgiana's mother, and Haley Atwell in a role that can be best described as cruel. Cooper's likability as Grey is a key component in the film, despite Cooper being absent for half of the movie, while Rampling is a strong force as well.What I enjoyed most about the film is the fact that I felt like I was in the late 1700's while watching. Everything from the lighting (it seemed as if all the light in the film was provided by the sun and/or candles), to simple things like Georgiana drinking while she was pregnant (because they didn't know the consequences of this at that time in history) made the atmosphere of the film perfect. The actions of Fiennes' character are heavily influenced by the time period. Georgiana is portrayed, to me, as a wonderful woman ready to change the world, but she was born in the wrong time period. A victim of circumstance, if you will.Don't even get me started on the elaborate sets and costumes, as well as the make-up. It's all Oscar worthy, and if all three don't get Oscar nominations, there's no dignity left in the world. Knightley's extravagant wardrobe, along with picture perfect wigs and hairstyles, coupled with incredibly realistic and terrific sets, add even more to the atmosphere of the film.The Duchess may have a ton of very strong points, but it is not without its weaknesses, such as the pacing of the film, which wasn't the best. Though running well below two hours, the film felt much longer because of repetitive party scenes that only serve to make us hate Fiennes more and further build other relationships in the film. I also found the score to be lacking in some parts, but it was still relatively strong.I don't see the film gaining a Best Picture nomination, but it should threaten in numerous other categories. If you respect the art of film-making, especially acting and the other technical areas, The Duchess will be a shining example for you. It's a gripping story of depression, loyalty, and ultimately, the choices people make. If you like Knightley or Fiennes, or period pieces in general, you'll love it.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Why didn't more people like this film?,"The Duchess (2008), directed by Saul Dibb, is a period film with a difference--the events actually happened. Keira Knightley portrays Georgiana, a young 18th Century aristocrat who entered a loveless marriage with the Duke of Devonshire, played well by Ralph Fiennes.The first surprise of the movie is that Knightley is able to look like the real Georgiana, Dutchess of Devonshire, whose likeness was captured by Reynolds and Gainsborough. The second surprise is that Knightley can act! (It's no surprise that she's strikingly beautiful in lavish period costumes, but I didn't know she had talent.)I don't pretend to be an expert in English history of that period, but the outline of the plot is historically accurate. In fact, the only overt historical discrepancy I could find is that Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper), who is in love with Georgiana, is portrayed as relatively poor and low-born. In reality, his family was powerful and well-connected.Hayley Atwell does well as Bess Foster, the Duchess's closest friend, and the incomparable Charlotte Rampling portrays Lady Spencer, Georgiana's mother. (Yes--it's the same Spencer family. Princess Diana in many ways reenacted the role of the Duchess 200 years later.)I enjoyed the film, and gave it a vote of 9. The IMDb average for the The Duchess is a mediocre 7.0. This is an excellent film. Why didn't more people like it?",9.0,Anonymous,History
Surprised by this piece,"I recorded this from TV months ago and only got round to watching it last night. My wife and I loved it. I was not expecting anything like so good after reading so-so reviews and hearing about the parallels with the Charles and Diana story. Yes there were parallels and I assume that there was that motivation for the movie. However it was more than that, a true story well told. I have never been a great fan of Keira Knightley but she really nailed this one. She went from young innocent to world weary woman through the course of the film and acquitted herself well her best performance since Atonement. Fiennes was great as her unfeeling, rigid husband too and avoided the cartoon villain that he could have been. However the weak link for me was Dominic Cooper - he just did not look right and was rather unconvincing as a possible (and eventual) Prime Minister. That aside a most enjoyable and absorbing movie, shot in the most gorgeous of stately homes (sets?).",8.0,Anonymous,History

Ralph really was fantastic, because as the film went on and you saw what really happened in that time period of the 18th century and the way is character is represented makes you realise how horrible men could/can be, he made his character have many sides though, and underneath all the anger and power that the duke has in the film, he is just a softy that is miserable and wants people to get off his back about things. this film has taught me a lot, how the fashion was, the politics and how the government was run, but most of all how badly women were treated and how selfish parents were back then, all because of money and rank.

First Class Film POSSIBLE SPOILERS,"Not having read Georgiana, the Duchess of Devonshire, I'm left wondering whether the obvious parallels with the story of Princess Diana were as pronounced in reality as they are in this film. Georgiana, splendidly acted by Keira Knightly, was herself a Spencer, like Diana -- and like Diana, she is married off to a high ranking personage, the Duke of Devonshire, played by the formidable Ralph Fiennes, who doesn't love her in the least and has only acquired her to produce a male heir. There is also a menage a trois -- inside the house -- involving a woman who initially wins Georgiana's heart and then betrays her with the Duke because that's the only way she can regain the children she lost to a husband less powerful than the Duke. And, of course, there's an illicit love affair between Georgiana and a rising Whig politician by whom she has a daughter that she must surrender to the father's family so as not to bring disgrace on the Duke or her own family. I guess I'll have to read the book to discover how much is true and how much is contrived.I'm beginning to wonder whether Keira Knightly regrets having earned all that money in the Pirates of the Caribbean series. Why? Because it has caused many critics to overlook her very real skills as an actor. From the moment she came to widespread attention as a teenage soccer enthusiast in Bend It like Beckham, Knightly's talent, as well as her remarkable physical beauty, have been obvious. She proved it in Pride and Prejudice, again in Atonement and once more in The Duchess. I trust that she will begin receiving the credit she is due -- even if she did enjoy commercial success in several quite forgettable films.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The most underrated film of 2008 ...,"I've always appreciated movies set in the eighteenth century for their aesthetic value on the surface and in the content, for their depiction of a world disguising under a mask of elegant sophistication the hideous face of decadence. This kind of ambivalence is so appealing that the odds of me enjoying a period film are generally very high. And Saul Dibb's ""The Duchess"" didn't disappoint me.I remember the first time I saw it in 2008, in a French movie theater during a very rainy day; I left up the place with delighted eyes and a broken heart. ""The Duchess"" is a dazzling celebration of the weirdest and fascinating world of the eighteenth century's European aristocracy, through a lead, Georgiana Kavendish who, beyond her Duchess of Devonshire title was a real Queen of fashion, and the story manages to betray the very feeling provided by the art and costume design by depicting this world as a golden prison endured by the heroine, played by Keira Knightley in a performance that should have earned her an Oscar nomination.I still wonder why the film was overlooked by the Academy, except for a lousy art direction and costume design nomination (a deserved win) when the epic ""Benjamin Button"" bore garnered much more accolades, I guess the film didn't have much more a drama except for the constant evolution in the relationship between the Duchess and the Duke of Devonshire. ""The Duchess"" might have disappointed the aficionados of the genre who were waiting for suicide attempts, duels, war, anything but bloodshed! But sincerely, even this relative peacefulness is handled with the sincere poignancy of a Bergmanian character study minus the philosophical undertones.""The Duchess"" never falls in the melodramatic trap because Georgiana is indeed a strong character. In the beginning, while she's playing with boys and girls of her age, her domineering personality leaves no doubts, she outshines everyone. Ironically, at the same time, she's seen through a window by her to-be husband, William, Duke of Devonshire, an affable ad quite-sinister looking Ralph Fiennes and the other girls all appear out of focus, literally. Georgiana's mother, Charlotte Rampling is praising both the physical and intellectual merits of her daughter, promising that she would be a credit to the Duke, as she already is to her, and we do believe her. The core of the story is foreshadowed when what preoccupies the Duke's mind the most is mentioned: having a son, the happiness of the couple would only rely on Georgiana's capability to give a son to the Duke, and history can be very capricious.""The Duchess"" works on the Fiennes – Knightley total opposition, he's reserved with a seriousness so icy it confines to indifference, while she's elegant, flamboyant with a level of wit that matches her style. During a dinner, she admirably retorts to one politician's pompous rhetoric in one of these particular scenes full of ambiguity, especially when the Duke leaves the party, is he upset by her behavior? No, he simply doesn't fancy these displays of political smartness, he's a practical man, who enjoys the company of his dogs, manly pleasures and more than anything wants to have a son. ""The Duchess"" would eventually overshadow her husband until he'd become the only one not in love with his wife, and the constant irony of ""The Duchess"" is that her popularity would always stop in the walls of her own house.The tense relation with her husband made of hypocrisy, cheating, and sterile conventions, constitute the golden cage in which she's condemned. One of the merits of the film is to portray not just the hellish marital existence of a woman, but the constant need of love, of friendship consequent to that privation. The nuptial scene is a demonstration of how unaffectionate and careless of the Duchess' nervousness, and in a way, it represents her marriage lifestyle in microcosm, something that invites the Duchess to find other ways to compensate a cruel lack of affection, popularity, fashion, parties, politics, and a heart-warming friendship with Bess Foster, the woman who'd ultimately become her rival, she obviously has some appeal for the Duke, or is it because she had three sons? Ralph Fiennes beautifully portrays the antagonism, pushing the degree of vileness to historical standards that almost make him look vulnerable. Totally, incapable of having sons, his harshness is like the awkward demonstration of his own weakness.The film doesn't portray the Duke in a harsh way either, in one scene, he's having some time with Bess' sons, teaching the older on the way to use a gun. We feel sorry for a man who can't fulfill his own dreams and by extent, for a couple who seems miserable in its incomparable wealth, both imprisoned by a poisoned dream that never seem to happen. The script manages to detach itself from the 'having a boy' plot by exploiting the real core of the film, which is simply the need of love. When the Duchess lives her first moments of pleasure with Bess and when she makes love with her real lover, the scenes are graphic as to illustrate the real contrast with the nuptial scene. The Duchess feels that this world is capable of love after all. The film evolves into the crucial conflict between what is done in the name of love and in the name of those we love, two elements that sometimes doesn't match.The film works as beautiful display of real human relationships trapped in a world of conventions and obligations, even more pitiful that they could have been avoided. I wish I'd find something that the movie lacked or that could have justified its overlook by critics and Academy, but I can't  I for one, think it's one of the best of 2008.",9.0,Anonymous,History

She always has the same approach of the character. And with this English costume drama, with a great cast, she was the weakest link.

Ralph Fiennes wasn't just the ""evil husband"", he was a man of his times, giving a complex and sympathetic edge to his character.I wasn't overly impressed with Dominic Cooper as Charles Grey, a flat forgettable sort, for such a heart wrenching love affair. I did like the introduction of Bess Foster as the other woman or other wife as the case may be and definitely felt G's frustration as her husband continued his adulterous liaison right in front of her while at the same time refusing to allow her to have her own, threatening to take the children.What an involving soap opera-ish storyline with the servants standing and listening in to all the arguments and scandal, forgotten by the players like they aren't even there. 10/12/15",9.0,Anonymous,History

Costume and Physical Beauty,"I despise the idiots who think that Keira Knightley can play a beautiful woman of any time period before 1980, so despite the fact that I have read a number of books about Georgiana and despite the fact that the time period is one of abiding interest to me, I was not going to watch this film. However, I could not resist the lure of the costumes and so finally I capitulated.The costumes are often very wonderful and although KK looks like a badly-put-together praying mantis in some of the outfits and hairstyles (particularly the early ones and the taller hairstyles, less so in the hedgehog variations which she quite suits to a 21st century eye) and although she does not resemble Lady Georgiana in the slightest, she does a very credible job of portraying the characteristics of Georgiana as most historians understand her to have been.Unfortunately, even when she looks divine in an outfit, she still looks nothing like the person whom she is portraying nor like someone who would not be pitied for her face in the time period in which she is supposed to be representing a great beauty.",8.0,Anonymous,History
One of the best period dramas in ages.,"A brilliant ensemble highlights this period drama about one of history's most interesting members of royalty. Director Saul Dibb does an excellent job of creating this extensive, intricate universe and the cinematography and score are the best of the year, but it's really Keira Knightley's performance that drives the film to the level of greatness it has achieved. She is absolutely phenomenal. She's never had a performance with this much fury, both external and internal, and she nails the delicacies of this without a second of hesitation. She knows exactly when to bottle up the pain and express it through her eyes and when to let all of the pent-up aggression out without ever going over the top. A shatteringly emotional performance that remains impressive all the way to the end. I'm tempted to call it her best performance, but I can't manage to say it's better than her work in Pride & Prejudice. Still, it's a close number two in her career. Of course she's not the only member of the cast, and the rest of the ensemble all does a great job of supporting her. The most impressive of that supporting cast would be Ralph Fiennes, whose piercing eyes shook me to the core whenever he came on screen. Two perfect performances in the best period film about royalty in quite some time.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Just A Poor Film,"I'm guessing this film was designed as a star vehicle for Miss Knightly. I'm not a cruel person but Kiera simply is not up to carrying such a weighty role. I believe Cate Blanchett, Emily Watson or Gwyneth Paltrow would have each had different takes on the character and come out on top. But KK simply doesn't have or has not yet developed the ability.There's a 1998 film called DANGEROUS BEAUTY set in 15th century Venice which is very similar to THE DUCHESS in that it centers on a women's fixed and extremely limited role in ruling class, aristocratic society (especially the concept of the mistress). DB succeeds because it focuses more on the society itself (not to mention a far stronger female in the lead role).Rather than say that this film is bad, its better said that it is just weak all around. And what an awful waste of Ralph Fiennes, who pretty much just struts around and mumbles when hes not making poor love.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Brilliant costume drama!!,"I went to this film at the cinema with my friends with not very high expectations of the film, mainly because I very rarely watch these genre of films. However, about fifteen minutes into the movie, I found myself completely astounded with the fantastic storyline and the terrific performances from the actors.For me, there was nothing that was unsatisfactory about the movie itself, however, I think many of the passionate love scenes were unnecessary but still, that is just my personal opinion.Generally, I thought the film was riveting and would recommend anyone to see this film even if you don't think 'it's your sort of film'.Keira Knightley has never really been a favourite actress of mine, but her performance as 'the duchess' was phenomenal and she made the part her own and acted it so well.In conclusion, this was a 10/10 movie, loved it!!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Being a princess not all it is cracked up to be,"I saw The Duchess on Saturday night, the latest English period piece (this time late 18th century) starring Kiera Knightly as a woman in a bad relationship. This time she is Georgiana, a slender, attractive, fashionable, emotional woman who is all but sold to the Duke of Devonshire, played as an ice-cold, aging, brute by Ralph (he would like you to call him ""Rafe"") Fiennes. The Duke of Love he is not, at one point he defends his disinterest, his rampant infidelity and his abuse of the power of his birthright by saying: ""I love you in the way I understand love."" As he understands it, the intent of marriage is nearly exclusive to produce a male heir which Georgiana fails to do on numerous tries. While he is waiting, he produces an illegitimate daughter and invites another woman to comes to live in the palace and attend social functions with the two of them. Georgiana takes solace in the future prime minister Charles Grey. They produce Eliza, whom she must give up or lose the children she has with the Duke. Georgiana eventually lives out her life quietly and is officially replaced as wife after her death. The movie is interesting largely because the relationship bears such a striking resemblance to the Prince Charles / Lady Diana Spencer (who is a descendant of one of the characters) / Camilla Parker Bowles affair. Diana/Georgiana are fashion icons both beloved by the nation (""the only one not in love with Georgiana is the Duke"" as one character describes the common wisdom). Charles / Duke are both dull (in most ways that word can be defined), plodding remnants of a once powerful royalty who would have risen to not a quantum of the power they possessed if left to their own devices. Of course, modern divorce laws and the continued marginalization of the monarchy meant that Diana would not share Georgiana's fate. The movie, and to some extent the modern story, put the lie to Disney's princess stories my girl's favor and suggest that Prince William may not be dreamy as you might think.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Poorly scripted with bad performances,"I decided to watch this movie on the hope of a great performance by Keira Knightley as she did in the 3 POTC. However, I found it sorely disappointed and deeply upset with the way this movies was written. As I always love movies that base on true stories, I truly think that if this reflects precisely the life of the Duchess, her life, I dare say, boring. Keira has little expression even on her face or her act to show any grief or sorrow or whatsoever. It makes me so sleepy to watch any part of the movie that involves her. How could a professional and well-known actress to be that amateur? The script is also boring and tiring as it was cut suddenly in various scenes which should have been longer or contain more dialogue. I would not recommend this movie to anyone I know except people who think every movie with KK is brilliant.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Good for viewing lavish costumes; poor script & acting,"This was made after Kiera became a star from 1st ""Pirates"" franchise. Budget was spent on her wardrobe, nothing else. Ralph makes silent/ few worded cameos. Kiera is thrilled with her wardrobe. Story & acting are all lacking.",2.0,Anonymous,History
Depressing stuff,"Sense requiem for a dream I haven't had this sensation of ""what the F just happened?"", but after seeing this movie I couldn't help this feeling of despair to get the best of me.The thing is, you will keep watching this movie with great attention, for reasons such as good acting and compelling plot, but when it comes to it and the credits will pop you won't be able to understand, or at least I didn't, what was the big deal.For some reason I feel like I should apologize, and therefore I say: ""I'm sorry, but to me it was just another depressed woman with a depressing story, pretty dresses and Keira knightly's nipple"".",5.0,Anonymous,History
More period less drama,The settings are glorious as are the costumes in this period story However there is very little Drama in the production wether this is due to bad script writing or bland reality I am unsure but the story was very bland and honestly quite uneventful if you discount the production of her having children. I prefer a bit more to my dramas.what is wrong with IMDb lately I have had to add these last few sentences in order to get my review as apparently you must use up no less than 600 characters? Some movies do not require that length of review if it's not great it's not great adding more words won't change that fact!,5.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent Keira in a pitiful movie (tv),"To resume, Keira plays the free-spirited wife of a royal and we should be moved by the injustices she endures ? Sorry but no way for me : for sure, as movies are done by privileged people, some of them can face hard times and maybe that class is interested and praises such movie ! but myself, as a worker and a citizen in a so-called democracy, i just don't give a s...t to the cries of the upper class ! This movie has the value to get into splendid houses and manors to understand their way of life : they have so much rooms for free and servants, maids to answer all their needs while having an really easy idle life that really i just don't care if they are happy or not ! With such privileges, they should be helpful giving hands instead of hypocritical lessons givers ! So this movie really left me cold and i'm a bit tired to see Keira as an aristocrat crying in period movies. But at least, England knows how to look back at its past because in France, i don't see movies about that time !",1.0,Anonymous,History
Pretty to look at,"This movie is pleasant to look at - the costumes and the sets are lavish, and would look even better if they were better lit and the lighting director didn't worry about what lighting was really like in 18th century interiors. This is a commercial movie, after all, not a BBC documentary.And the acting is all very fine. You really feel for the poor duchess, who is trapped in a prison I would not wish on any man or woman.But in the end, the problem with this movie is the script. It doesn't build to anything. Suddenly the movie is over, and I went: Oh? Each scene is fine, well-acted and well-directed. The movie has points to make and it makes them well.But there is no structure, no build. It just moves from scene to scene, with no apparent direction.A shame, as everything else was so good.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Boring.,"Still the most boring movie I have ever seen. I watched it on a long haul flight. Put me to sleep a few times, eventually got through it all but it was a slog.

An  aristocratic woman  trapped in  the social mores of her time..,"Britons might be sorely divided in their desire to be in or out, but there is one topic on which they are forever united - their passion, or rather their obsession with their Royalty. Here's one small indicator. When we rented an apartment in Cambridge, one of the first tasks we had to undertake was to move the huge volume of our landlady's book collection to the garage. More than half of those garage full of books dealt with the Royal family!Of course, the most obsessed over member of that family is undoubtedly Princess Diana. A film, based on the life of her great-great...aunt the Duchess of Devonshire which had an uncanny similarity with Lady D's own life, is bound to generate a lot of interest. Apparently, the trailer of this 2008 movie even used a couple of Lady D shots to ensure that.However, for folks outside the orbit of that royal obsession, this is basically about the life of an aristocratic woman trapped in the social mores of her time, despite all the worldly privileges that came with her rank and status. Unfortunately, the movie could not rise above its curiosity value (even while giving us an excellent glimpse into the English aristocratic life in the eighteenth century) as the events, instead of flowing smoothly, had somewhat of a jerky feel. As if we are given a lesson in history, above all.Keira Knightly, as expected, is a natural in the role of an old-world English Duchess. But Ralph Fiennes is totally wasted in the role of the Duke of Devonshire. Watching this, I wouldn't have believed him emerging with that commanding presence of M in Spectre a few years down the line.",5.0,Anonymous,History
The Duke,"With all the young actresses out there, especially with so many from the UK in what seems like every major role, it was a bad choice for Knightley. Get someone who is no older than 20 to match reality, she's an old looking 23 at the time, the same goes for Fiennes who is 23 yrs older than Knightley, when it should only be an 8 year difference. Unfortunately accuracy isn't a huge concern for the movie makers, which is why they fail so often.Charles Grey was also done wrong as he would have been 10 yrs old when she first met him & they make it appear he was 17.At least 1 reviewer got the reaction the producers wanted to portray, total sympathy for poor Georgiana & a deep hatred toward the Duke.Never mind she volunteered into that relationship for money & status, knowing full well that all Dukes/Kings wanted sons, she could have married Grey in the modern revision of this movie & had her happy ever after moment.I would like to see just 1 movie where M aren't the bad people all the time, this storyline is getting so old propping up every F character with revisionist history.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Nice to watch after a long day of work,"I recently watched pride and prejudice and fell in love with Keira Knightly. I also love movies set in the 18th or 19th century. So a friend recommended me 'the duchess'.First of all i must admit:
It is strange seeing lord voldemort with a nose, though Ralph Fiennes does a good job in his role as the duke.Keira Knightly's voice and acting is as enchanting as always, and made me want to watch even more of her work.With astonishing costumes and nice settings the films atmosphere is in every way received by the audience.I feel the story was a bit rushed, and throughout the whole film it felt as they were trying to tell five books in two hours. Though I must admit I tend to like a slow burn romance, the film still seemed somewhat driven.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Ralph Fiennes the bigoted sexist,"Keira Knightley is the 18th century aristocrat Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, who was reviled for her extravagant political and personal life. Intentionally drawing comparisons to Princess Diana, The Duchess is a lustre of period visuals, stimulating set decoration and amazing costumes by designer Michael O'Connor.There are a few stand out performances and scenes, particularly from Knightley and Charlotte Rampling as Lady Spencer. Whiles the story isn't the most engaging, it is well directed by Saul Dibb and is an entertaining piece that reflects the social works and aristocracy of the time.There are other distinguished films set in the same time period, and while this isn't the best example, it's worth 110 minutes of your time, if only to see Ralph Fiennes performance as the bigoted sexist Duke.",,Anonymous,History
A 3D portrait of the tragic Lady Georgiana,"This film is about the eventful marriage and the untimely relationship of Lady Georgiana, The Duchess of Devonshire.""The Duchess"" has an intricate and well layered plot that captivates me throughout. Lady Georgiana's charm, wit, quest for freedom, endurance and ability to survive such immense psychological hardship is beyond words. Her character is developed very well that draws viewers into her life, and hence into the film. Keira Knightley is excellent as a well raised intellectual lady living in unfortunate circumstances. She expresses her character to the full, creating much resonance regarding the tragic happenings of Lady Georgiana. The lavish sets and costumes also create a visual feast that constantly pleases the eye that demands much visual stimulation. ""The Duchess"" is a great period piece that captivates and engages throughout. I really enjoyed watching it.",,Anonymous,History
Sad movie about sad people and sad times,"Every girl wants to be a princess. They think princesses have many beautiful dresses, a charming prince to dance with and a huge castle to live in. And they do not need to do anything...The Duchess is a interesting costume drama that shows the real life of Duchess of Devonshire (Keira Knightley). When she was 18, she decided to marry much older prince (Ralph Fiennes) whom she has seen only two times before the marriage. She knew that she has only one task: to give him a masculine child, but she hoped that the love come with time. She was wrong...The movie is rather slow-paced, very sad, but interesting. It proofs that the reality behind the palace's walls is not as beautiful as it seems and the real prince not always is a prince from the tales. Sad is that the movie portraits the duchess only as a unhappy wife. She was also a trend- setter and a politician figure. We see some scenes about it but they are too rare...",,Anonymous,History
Period Drama at it's best,"If you want an engine then go to Germany, if you want a fine wine then go to France but if you want a period drama of sublime beauty that will stay with you forever then go to England.Not since Bride's Head Revisited have I seen a film deliver so flawlessly on every level. Every scene, every movement, every nuance of emotion is painted with the brush stroke of a master. A beautiful, bittersweet tale told magnificently.I never tire of Ralph Fiennes and here he is at his best. I always rated Keira Knightley as many others may; namely an averagely good actress that is very pleasing on the eye, but on this occasion she excelled herself.Dim the lights, turn off the phone and if you are not impressed by the end of the movie then ask the Devil for your soul back.",,Anonymous,History
