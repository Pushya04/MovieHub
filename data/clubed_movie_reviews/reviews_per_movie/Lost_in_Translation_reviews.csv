"Didn't get it at first, then 15 years later I totally got it","I was living in Japan at the time the movie came out and I didn't get it at the time. My mistake was thinking the movie had anything to do with Tokyo and for me, seeing Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) be bored in Tokyo seemed so stupid to me.But, I watched it again 15 years later and totally got it. Maybe because I'm lost too I finally got it. It's got nothing to do with Tokyo and everything to do with 2 people feeling completely lost in their lives. Tokyo is just a setting that's different from most westerner's every day lives to try to convey that feeling of ""lost"" to the viewer.Neither of them have any idea what to do any more. Their lives seem meaningless to themselves. Charlotte has been married just 2 years but she's already disillusioned in her marriage. She calls her mom very early in the movie crying because she's in Tokyo, seeing new things, knowing it should be exciting but feeling nothing. And further, her husband is seeming like a different person than the person she thought she married. Her mom doesn't listen and doesn't have time for her (same as my mom, haha).Bob Harris (Murray) is similarly lost. He wants to find some acting project he's passionate about but instead his manager has him making commercials in Japan. His relationship with his wife is clearly not going well (listen to their conversation on the phone about a hour in) and so he's lost too realising his marriage is basically over and they're just two people who happen to be living together.If, like the younger me, you haven't experienced that feeling of being lost, the movie will probably do nothing for you. But, If you ever get in to a point in your life where you're feeling lost, watch it again and you might enjoy it.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Lost Souls,"It's been a long time since a movie has made me hurt the way this one did. Perhaps ""hurt"" isn't the right word.  ""Ache"" is more like it.  I could so completely identify with both characters.Bob is a middle-aged actor caught in a life which has lost its zest and purpose, doing what he ""ought"" to be doing (making money doing whiskey commercials) instead of doing what he WANTS to do (plays).  And then a young, beautiful, intelligent woman enters his orbit.  On that level alone, with its mute longing and sexual tension, I can identify with him.And then there is Charlotte, a student of philosophy seeking herself, her soul lost and adrift.  She doesn't know who she is, doesn't know what she wants.  Her life is a quest for authenticity of self.  And I identify with her because so much of my life I have been seeking the same thing.This movie isn't for everyone.  They will call it boring, lifeless, limp. There are people, I realize, who have never experienced that kind of longing, who had never sought meaning in their lives, and searched for their own lost souls.  They live for the here and now, without giving a thought to the spiritual aspects of life.A friend said introverts will love this movie, extraverts will hate it.  I think that is a fair surface assessment.  This movie is all about the inner lives of two people whose souls connect for a brief time in an alien city. It is a love affair not of bodies, but of minds and spirits.Some this movie will make angry.  Some this movie will make weep.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Sometimes the simplest stories make the best films,"I went through an array of emotions and expressions watching this film; most of them centred around how bizarre I thought it was, yet it was like a good book I simply couldn't put down even if the film itself lived up to its title at times.This is by far the best work Bill Murray has done, and it will be a pleasant surprise for many to see him find a new (to me, anyway) side to his ability as an actor. He captures the role with such precision that you don't realise this is the same guy who, dare I even mention it in the same breath, provided the voice of Garfield last year. You see a few traces of his characteristic smugness every once in a while, but by and large the Bill Murray you see is a lot more serious... and seriously damned good.It's such a simple story... unhappy married man meets unhappy married woman in a place neither of them are familiar with, and suddenly realise that they're all the other has got at least for the time being. In an age where Hollywood is trying (mostly unsuccessfully) to scare and shock us with something new at every turn, Sofia Coppola takes what should be the premise for a typical chick flick and turns it into something that anyone who has ever experienced an emotion of any description can watch and appreciate.A brilliant film in any language.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
What makes a good movie...,"When I used to think of what made a good movie, I would look at a movie from all aspects: direction, cinematography, editing, acting, story etc. The sum of all these parts make up the whole, and are also what lead me to my opinion of a film...Then came Lost in Translation. The first time I watched this movie, I felt a strange sense of depression that lasted for a few days, but I couldn't put my finger on why. I watched it again and again, and felt the same way each time. I thought maybe it was because I have never traveled and would really like to, or that I have the desire to find the perfect woman in a strange world.Whatever the case, I realized one thing. LOST IN TRANSLATION MADE ME THINK. It made me question my life, its purpose, whether I was happy or not, and what I want do with it. Never has a movie touched me in such a way, and for that reason, this is the one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. That doesn't mean its the best movie ever made, in fact, I can name many that are technically better than this film, like the one I named before. But I cannot name a movie that has had more effect on me than Lost in Translation, and that is why I love it and will love it forever.Think of the last movie that really made you think, one that had such a great influence on you that it somehow changed your life, even for the littlest bit. That, to you, is a great movie...",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Lingers for days- sucks you in.,"Few movies make you THINK long after they end. That's OK. Movies are supposed to entertain and most do so without requiring even one ounce of thought. It's sad that maybe some of you out there prefer movies- and life- that way. Thankfully this movie is all about thinking and feeling. This is not a chick flick. It's a human experience flick.This film examines and lays bare the intricacies of love, life and loneliness; the claustrophobia, insomnia and disorientation of traveling to a foreign country. The loneliness that creeps in after life's normality starts to wear thin. The spark of promise that meeting someone new brings. This is what life is about and what this film so flawlessly portrays.How many of you can relate to and have actually been that guy/girl on business, in the hotel in some foreign city, happily married yet feeling alone and beaten by life's banality? How many of us have been tempted in that very situation, to stray from the confines of moral adherence for the lure of a forbidden, if fleeting, joy? How many have felt that tingle- that spark- when a stranger smiles and you think, ""you know, in another life...""? Change the time, place and all of us have been there whether we admit it or not. Maybe single people don't get this movie; maybe it's for those of us who have walked down that aisle and are wiser to the realities of life.The characters here are true. Their dialog is true. The setting is true. It's all tirelessly fascinating because we can all relate to it and it involves us in a way that most movies do not. We find ourselves drawn to every moment these two experience together and apart. We are intrigued by the glances, nuances and words they share.Johanssen is brilliant and beautiful as the lonely, young wife questioning her marriage. Her beauty is classic, not necessarily sexual, though she is obviously alluring in this role. Her bee-stung lips, perfect body and haunting eyes may have something to do with that. Still she's more sophisticated beauty than mindless hottie, even at 19. This is a role tailor-made for her. It could never have been Reese Witherspoon or Jessica Alba or - God forbid- Jessica Simpson, or anybody else in that realm.Murray is simply at his best. He does ""exasperated, middle-aged and depressed"" better than most, with his receding hairline and frumpy body. You really believe that these two could connect in a physical and emotional way, as remote as that may seem on the surface. What other 50-something could ever be believed to be appealing to a young woman as pretty as Charlotte? That's a tough chemistry to fake and I can't think of a more perfect pair. What drives them to this attraction is what's intriguing to watch.Go see this. Turn off your ""Major Blockbuster-Tom Cruise-Action-Pop Culture Catch Phrase-Big Star"" mind and tune in with a more searching self. Watch this with your soul and heart, not your eyes. If you look deeper than the surface you'll find yourself moved by the whole experience. Yes, it's THAT good.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"A great film, but the rating was lost in translation","It's very interesting to see all of the ratings that Lost In Translation received in different countries. In Canada it is only PG, while in America it's rated R! And really, the only explanation for this is a brief scene at a strip joint that shows some nudity. I really look down on that R rating because Lost In Translation is a good-hearted film that should be enjoyed by all ages. Notice how during the 2003 Oscar season two films played the ""only one special effect: the effect on the audience"" card; one being this film and the other being Mystic River. Both are great films, both are rated R in the U.S., but only one of them can carry along its story without brutal murders.So what can I say about Lost In Translation that hasn't been said a million times already? It's all true. It's subtle, down-to-earth, and allows the audience to observe and relate to the characters, Bob and Charlotte. Both of them have a life crisis to deal with, and I guess if you're thousands and thousands of miles away from your problems it makes it easier to take an objective look at them, even if they do follow you. Bob and Charlotte confide in each other and develop a relationship. That's what it's all about, and every scene is precious. It's a real and true to life kind of film. We never hear the lines: ""Oh, Charlotte, I'm so glad I went to Japan. You've changed my life in such a profound way and you'll always be in my heart."" That's because that just isn't the way it goes in real life. The feeling is there, the characters know it, the audience knows it, so it has to be left at that.So, yeah, I love this movie. It's clearly the highlight of Bill Murray's career and marks the perfect first real stand-out in Scarlett Johanson's. It's so rare to see a movie that only has an interest in its characters (and only two of them, at that!) and makes them so charming, lovable, and familiar. This is a great example of non-Hollywood Hollywood films: the well-known actors and producers going to the roots of independent film-making. In an age where half the movies out there are packed with CGI, this is refreshing to see.My rating: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A masterpiece about the mood and states of the characters,"It is not easy to talk about ""Lost in Translation"". Sofia Coppola's second film as a director is in part about things we never talk about. While its two protagonists try to find mutual solace in each other, their silence is as expressive as their words. This is a film that believes that an individual can have a valuable relationship with someone else without becoming part of that person's life. At 19 years of age, I am not married but I can understand pretty well that it is easier for a stranger with whom you share a moment in the bar or corridor to understand your problems better than your husband or wife. Here is an extract from Roger Ebert's great review of the film: ""We all need to talk about metaphysics, but those who know us well want details and specifics; strangers allow us to operate more vaguely on a cosmic scale. When the talk occurs between two people who could plausibly have sex together, it gathers a special charge: you can only say ""I feel like I've known you for years"" to someone you have not known for years.""In this marvellous story, the two lonely individuals that merge the illusions of what they have and what they could have are two Americans. The emotional refuge, Tokyo. We have Bob Harris (Bill Murray), and actor in his fifties who was once a star, and is now supplementing his incomes with the recording of a whisky commercial. On the other side of the telephone, a frightening reality: his wife, his sons, and the mission of choosing the right material for heaven knows what part of the house. When we consider Bob's situation, we realise that Lost in Translation is also a meditation on the misery of fame. Certainly fame has great (perhaps greater than disadvantages) advantages but then there are the obligations, the expectations...We also have Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), a woman in her twenties who is accompanying her husband, a photographer addicted to work, on a business trip. But it could said it is as if she is alone anyway. Her world, just like Bob's, is reduced to strange days in the bedroom, the corridors, the hotel's swimming pool, and the bar, the perfect destination for victims of sleeplessness and wounded soul. The bar is the place Bob and Charlotte meet for the first time. They talk, little, but just enough. Once their dislike for parts of their lives are established, they begin sharing times that feel dead to be able to feel alive.Bob and Charlotte are souls in transition for whom, surrounded and confused by exotic rituals, and a different language, allows them a moment to lose their identities. Both characters provoke similar feelings form different experiences. There are no kisses or crazy nights between them, but only a shared intimacy in which a night out, a walk in the streets, a session of karaoke becomes a powerful expression of their affection an complicity. The relationship we all await only happens in our minds and the protagonists, whom we are not allowed to know everything they say and desire. Tokyo metaphorically speaking is the third character in the film. The bright colours, the noise of the city...just everything evokes the various spiritual awakenings of the characters.It ends on a perfect note leaving the relationship of the characters undecided. A rare gem in modern day cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Filmed in Tokyo, with Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson, one of the better movies I've seen in a while.","For anyone who wants a synopsis of this movie, the critics Ebert and Berardinelli have excellent, complete reviews of 'Lost in Translation', and they both give it their highest ratings.My wife and I saw it tonight on DVD, with DTS 5.1 sound and both think it is a remarkable movie. I like Bill Murray in just about everything, and this will go down as one of his strongest performances, as Bob, the actor in Japan for a week doing whisky commercials. Scarlett Johansson plays Charlotte, the young wife virtually abandoned in the city to do her own thing as her photographer husband (Ribisi) goes to various locations for shoots.What I liked most was the realistic feel. Being in a strange city, with unusual customs and a language you have no hope of understanding. Meeting someone who because of circumstances (age, marital status) will only ever be a friend. Being able to talk freely. Reflecting on where we've been and where we might be going. Many of the negative comments about this movie relate to an impression that it is 'boring.' I'll put on my 'maturity hat' and state that anyone who thinks 'Lost In Translation' is boring simply was not able, at least while they watched it, appreciate the inner beauty of this movie.The scene that made the whole story come together for me was when they were in one of their hotel rooms (doesn't matter which), overhead shot, they were in bed talking, fully clothed, he is on his back staring at the ceiling, she is on her side, eyes probably closed, the tips of her feet barely touching the side of his leg, and he moves his hand and puts it on her feet. Then the scene fades to black. It is the kind of tender, non-sexual touch that tells us how close they have become, and that theirs is a relationship of mutual trust and admiration, not one of lust.People like Bob and Charlotte really exist, and they really do meet up in very similar situations. After a week, they must go their separate ways, he to his family and activities of his kids, she to wait for her husband and figure out how to get out of the rut. We sense that he does not love her the way she needs, and we wonder what will happen.Before IMDb eliminated its discussion feature there was a lot of dialog about what he whispered to her in the street at the end of the movie. To have made it obscure is suitable, it allows each viewer to imagine what they thought he would have said. In real life he is 34 years older, he does have a family, she is still just trying to figure her life out, to me it would have been a comment of genuine affection and encouragement that things will work out well for her, either with her husband or with someone else.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Perfect.,"Death in Vegas' spellbinding song ""Girls"" perfectly sets the tone for Sofia Coppola's second feature film, the bittersweet, intelligent, mature and absolutely wonderful Lost in Translation. Trying to summarize the movie is almost pointless because the emotions the film sparks within you (in my case, at least) can't be described in words. The basic story follows Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), a washed-up, depressed actor and an emotionally confused newlywed respectively, as they accidentally meet on Park Hyatt Hotel in Tokyo. The two form an unusual bond, but a bond that is infinitely stronger than that which they share with their respective wife and husband (Charlotte's partner is a jittery photographer who doesn't pay very much attention to her; Bob's better half keeps calling him, pestering him about which colour they should choose for the carpet back home). Bob and Charlotte's relationship is not really a sexual thing so much as a matter of emotional understanding. They're both stuck in life, unsure of what to do with the rest of it and certainly not very satisfied with what they've done with it so far. It's very touching to watch, in a refreshingly non-sappy way.The film isn't all mid-life-crisis slit-your-wrists drama, though - it is also hilarious at many points, mainly thanks to Bill Murray, who turns deadpan exasperation into an artform in a role specifically written for him. The pressure on him is high because he is basically the heart and soul of the film, but he nails the part and he's so great I was really surprised to see that he was nominated for an Oscar (since the Academy rarely hands out awards to performances that are actually *good*). Scarlett Johansson is stunning and convincing in her role and more than holds her own against Murray. Giovanni Ribisi as the aforementioned dorky husband and Anna Faris as a brain dead actress are perfectly cast and it's hard not to hate them.Sofia Coppola's direction is amazing, both stylistically original, passionate and spellbinding. There are many gorgeous images of Tokyo on display here and she finds the right balance between these eye-catching visuals, Murray's comedy and Johansson's angst. Her style is very different from her father's and shouldn't be compared. She clearly shows that she is fully capable of having a career of her own without putting her faith in Hollywood nepotism.Favourite scenes? Bob's ""Santury time"" scene is pure comic gold, and the most emotional part, in my opinion, is the karaoke scene during Bob and Charlotte's night out, when Murray sings his version of Bryan Ferry's ""More than this"". The scene, the way I see it, says so much about the characters and what they're going through. In fact, I'd call it the most important scene in the entire film. Then again, maybe Sofia Coppola just wanted to hear Bill's awesome singing voice (he's actually really good!).Overall the film is just perfect. The acting, the direction, the soundtrack, plot, themes, humour, visuals... what's not to like? I know some were turned off by the supposedly ""slow"" pace, which I just thought helped the movie become more captivating. The central relationship needs to take its time to feel realistic. Honestly, what do you want, car chases? It's an existential drama, not Run Lola Run. Sheesh.For relaxing times... make it Lost in Translation time.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A tale of two souls,"A story about a man and a woman who, despite their age difference, have more in common than it first appears. Both suffer with feeling lost and disconnected from the lives they live. Bob is a movie star who no longer does movies and instead does commercials. While this provides more than enough money to live comfortably, it leaves him feeling unfulfilled. Married for 25 years with kids, life seems old and uninteresting to Bob, which contrasts sharply with the bright and loud Tokyo streets.Cut to Charlotte, a young woman with a philosophy degree that is also in Tokyo with her husband, who's there for work as a photographer. Charlotte feels lost and unsure about her next steps in life. One night, they meet at the hotel bar and strike up a conversation. This interaction leads to them becoming friends, and from that moment, you see Bob change; it almost seems as if a spark is lit, and life becomes more exciting.Both feel neglected in their lives: Charlotte doesn't feel understood by her fiancé or her mom, which we glimpse during a phone call. Bob faces similar issues; his conversations with his wife seem more focused on trivial matters, like the color of the carpet, than on how he's doing. To me, the relationship between Bob and Charlotte isn't romantic. Instead, they are both very thankful to one another because they guide each other to a better understanding of their paths in life.Overall this film explores finding meaning in unexpected places.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"A Quiet, Personal Film","Being in a profession where there is constant noise, I enjoyed this movie for a very odd reason. The characters are pulling away from a hyped up society, away from a world, much of which is based on needless, trivial noise. Everywhere they go there is more numbing action. Watching the director of the commercial gyrating, trying to act like a real film director, despite the fact that they are doing a 30 second liquor commercial, typifies some of what this movie is about, a world where people are worn into the ground by a type A culture that is as vapid and unnecessary as we can imagine. I thought the Bill Murray character developed tremendously. While this trip to Japan was excruciatingly dull (money isn't everything), I believe that he began to see things he hadn't seen before. I liked that while he was struggling with his marriage, the crises were simple, day to day things that living brings to us. The young woman he meets shows through a whimsical kindness, that he is worth something. She is refreshing to look at an to be with. He, like many middle aged men, has self doubts. Because she has a sense of purity and can talk to him honestly about her world and his, he should go back to his life a little more sustained.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Lost on me...,"I usually agree with the general consensus on what makes a good film and what doesn't, but very occasionally I find myself watching a widely popular film and wondering what on earth people saw in it. 'Lost in Translation' is one of those films. It did nothing for me and I thought it was very average and even forgettable.It doesn't matter to me how slow or subtle a drama film is, but I do expect it to connect with me and make me feel something. 'Lost in Translation' left me cold. I found it to be dull and uninspiring. The characters are wooden and emotionless. The plot does nothing and goes nowhere.Maybe I will rewatch this film on another day and see it in another light, but on first viewing, 'Lost in Translation' is lost on me.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Sad, funny, magical and irresistibly moving","I had been well aware of this film's reputation as a masterpiece for some time, and when I finally saw it I was so glad I did. I have seen it three times now, it improves each time. Lost in Translation is a brilliant film, but also a film you need to see more than once to appreciate it.Lost in Translation for example is a brilliantly written film. The script is wonderful, with a healthy balance of energetic humour and bittersweet soul-searching. The story, driven by its characters, is slowly-paced but purposefully so, any faster it would have detracted from any magic and poignancy and also would have made the title irrelevant. And I love the ambiguous but very meaningful ending. Lost in Translation manages to be both sad and funny, but it is also in its tone a magical and irresistibly moving film.I can't say I am a fan of Sophia Coppola. I can say though Lost in Translation is her best written and best directed film, and probably the only one I would consider a masterpiece. And speaking of Coppola, she makes some risky but wise decisions such as the balance of the humour and the bittersweet poignancy and altogether it is a rock-solid directing job.Lost in Translation looks absolutely beautiful too, with its skillful lighting, beguiling location work and stunning cinematography. The Japan-pop soundtrack creates a big emotional impact, and just adds to the authenticity Lost in Translation has.The acting is marvellous. Bill Murray gives a delicate, restrained and masterful performance in the lead role, and from his performance here you would never guess he is the same Bill Murray who starred in broader films like GhostBusters. Scarlett Johanssen also gives one of her best performances as the younger woman trapped in a loveless marriage, not to mention she looks lovely here and shares a believable chemistry with Murray.In conclusion, a masterpiece. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"The equivalent of cinematic fishing - once you're hooked, the film isn't letting you go","Lost in Translation details the kind of wayward search for human connection many of us go through in life, sometimes young, sometimes old, or following a traumatic event. It's the time in our lives when we feel the most lost, and truthfully, many of us don't want answers as to how to better our situation, but just want somebody to go along for the ride. We'd like to find someone to empathize with, embrace on a frequent basis, and know that somebody cares about us and our wayward ways and to reciprocate such feelings.With this, Sofia Coppola writes and directs a film about that search for human connection and what it can exactly amount to. We are immediately introduced to Bob Harris (Bill Murray), an older American movie star who travels to Tokyo to film an advertisement for Suntory whiskey. Bob has found himself in the mix of a souring marriage and no real close friends, and it is in Tokyo where Bob sinks deeper and deeper into a midlife crisis. Meanwhile, we also meet Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), a college graduate whose husband John (Giovanni Ribisi) is starting to lose interest in her in favor of all the models he works with.Later on, Bob and Charlotte finally meet and immediately recognize each others unfortunate situation. They spend sporadic amounts of time together, often not talking and simply speaking in fragmented sentences and lying next to one another. They aren't very concerned with long conversation; they simply let their lethargy in their current situations carry their relationship along.Over time, sexual tension between the two builds, though both of them are still caught in relationships, regardless of how mediocre they are. In addition, neither of them are quite sure how to conjure intimacy with one another. The two are much more in tune with being static beings and platonic. This is one of the few dramas I can recall that allows the presence of the characters to take over rather than their actions. Coppola sits back and watches with a keen eye and a sense of mannered restraint how Bob and Charlotte get close over the course of their visit in Tokyo.Coppola's interest lies in Bob and Charlotte's situation moreso than the progression of their relationship, which is a difficult thing to pull off in film without working with more of an impressionistic style. The brushstrokes Coppola paints this story in are more or less minimal, but they craft just enough out of a little so that we can recognize these characters, their feelings, and their current state. They have transcended living life into simply existing within it, rarely getting excited and scarcely finding any kind of mutual contentment.Again, in these situations, all you need is another soul who feels the same way you do, and in this case, that's bottled up angst and complete and total uncertainty. The title represents a lot of things and the cultural gap Bob and Charlotte experience is only a small part of it; these two souls are lost within the translation of life. Life has keep going and two formerly active people who could keep up with the bustle have let it all pass by, letting sadness dominate their lives and fogginess encapsulate the remnants of the future. The translation lost is within the characters here, and that's sometimes scarier than not speaking the same language of the community.The only issue that arises from this is that we get the impression that Coppola either doesn't understand Japanese culture or simply doesn't want to, what with the abundance of cheap stereotypes and archetypal Japanese characters played for nothing but laughs here. Coppola opens by ostensibly getting most out of her way, thankfully, however, through the use of subtle humor, but sporadically doubles back to throw in another jab or two, which can briefly throw the film out of whack. It reminds me of when a really artsy film wants to try and pander and connect with the audience when it thinks it has lot them, and, as shown here amidst others, the action has the opposite effect.However, Murray and Johansson craft wonderful, low-key chemistry here. Murray's subtle sarcasm and overall cynicism are downplayed but in force here, as he employs facial expressions that speak louder than words could. He fully shows how he can be a hilarious comic presence and a fascinating, real dramatic presence and merge the two in one project, proving nothing but great range and ability on his behalf. Johansson, who was only eighteen during the time this was being filmed, bears mannerisms and a self-assured aura that would be more expected from someone ten years older than her. Such lofty material is presented and she handles the task of not being too theatrical or obvious very well, and it's a performance that requires both actors to place a reliance on their body language and facial expressions. This was by no means an easy role for Johansson, yet she breaks out with it and becomes a force all her own.Lost in Translation details a difficult time in a person's life and, in the process, doesn't sugarcoat it. The lack of human connection and the feelings of hopelessness, regardless of short-term or long-term, are debilitating to a person, and this film goes on to show to reiterate my idea about life: if we didn't have at least one of these things - a passion, a good relationship with family, or close friends and people to connect with - we would jump out a window.Starring: Bill Murray, Scarlett Johansson, Giovanna Ribisi, and Anna Faris.

breath taking,"A lot of my friends told me the movie was dull and had no story line. However, i thought it was a moving story about love and relationships and life in general. I believe if people watched the movie they'd like it more for the subtle brilliance that prevails. The roles played by Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson performed flawlessly with enough emotion as necessary. It will now be one of my favourite films though not action - packed it is a masterpiece of emotion and through the use of clever cinematography enthrals the viewer. I would suggest this is more of a chick flick though I'm sure most men will understand the true emotion of the film.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Enjoyable and gentle,"I enjoyed watching Lost in Translation, even though it is (intentionally no doubt) rather understated.It tells the story of two lost souls - Bob (Bill Murray), a middle aged man in a stale marriage facing the all too familiar mid life crisis, and Charlotte (Scarlet Johansson), a young woman just two years into a marriage that already feels like a mistake. Their paths cross during a few days staying in a hotel in Tokyo, Japan, and we follow them as their shared loneliness and inner emptiness draws them towards one another.Having introduced the characters, you may think this seems like a rather cliched 'older man falls for younger woman' story, and in some ways it probably is. However, the relationship between Bob and Charlotte develops around empathy and companionship rather than lust, and for that it can be applauded. Where this movie also scores is the setting, the gentle pace and the space it gives to the viewer.The Tokyo setting works well. Noisy and vibrant at times, cheesy and colourful at others, it provides our characters with a deepened sense of isolation from the world around them. The relaxed pace of the film works too, and it is brave enough to deploy significant moments of silence that feel natural and right, providing a contrasting calm among the city chaos.The two lead actors play their parts well, resulting in believable characters, and though they are both unhappy with their life situation the film is not at all bleak or depressing. There are moments of gentle humour throughout the film, and both characters bring a lightness to their naval gazing.Lost in Translation is not a film that is particularly moving or memorable, but is a film which is refreshingly understated, mature, observationalist, and allows the viewer their own time and space to reflect.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
peace and comfort,"""Lost in Translation"" is a cinematic masterpiece that delicately weaves together themes of loneliness, connection, and the search for meaning amidst the vastness of Tokyo's urban landscape. Directed by Sofia Coppola and released in 2003, the film stars Bill Murray as Bob Harris, a faded movie star, and Scarlett Johansson as Charlotte, a young woman struggling with the ennui of her marriage. Set against the backdrop of Tokyo's bustling streets and neon-lit nights, the film explores the unlikely bond that forms between these two lost souls as they navigate the complexities of life in a foreign land.At its core, ""Lost in Translation"" is a quiet and introspective film that thrives on the nuances of human emotion. From the opening scenes, Coppola establishes a sense of dislocation and disorientation that mirrors the inner turmoil of her protagonists. Bob and Charlotte find themselves adrift in a sea of unfamiliar sights and sounds, unable to fully connect with the world around them. Yet, in each other, they discover a kindred spirit, someone who understands the weight of their solitude and shares in their longing for connection.One of the film's greatest strengths lies in its understated performances, particularly from Murray and Johansson. Murray imbues Bob with a world-weary charm and vulnerability that makes him instantly relatable, while Johansson captures Charlotte's quiet intelligence and yearning with subtlety and grace. Their chemistry is palpable, infusing every scene with a sense of intimacy and authenticity that is both heartbreaking and uplifting to watch.What sets ""Lost in Translation"" apart from other films is its ability to find beauty in the mundane. Coppola has a keen eye for detail, capturing the small moments of everyday life with a poetic grace that lends the film an ethereal quality. Whether it's the soft glow of a Tokyo sunrise or the hushed stillness of a late-night encounter, each frame is imbued with a sense of quiet wonder that invites viewers to lose themselves in the moment.But perhaps what resonates most deeply about ""Lost in Translation"" is its profound sense of empathy. Through Bob and Charlotte's journey, the film reminds us of the universal desire for connection and understanding that binds us all together. In a world where it's easy to feel lost and alone, the film offers a gentle reminder that we are never truly alone as long as we have each other.For me personally, ""Lost in Translation"" has been a source of immense comfort during times of uncertainty and upheaval. Like Bob and Charlotte, I have often felt adrift in a world that seems too vast and overwhelming to navigate alone. Yet, in the quiet moments of connection and understanding that the film so beautifully captures, I find solace and reassurance that I am not alone in my struggles.There is a scene towards the end of the film where Bob whispers something into Charlotte's ear, the words of which are never revealed to the audience. It's a moment of pure intimacy, a shared secret between two people who have found comfort in each other's presence. In many ways, ""Lost in Translation"" is like that whispered confession - a quiet reminder that even in our darkest moments, there is always hope to be found in the connections we make along the way.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"It's a good movie but for my standards, it could be much better.","There was nothing special, I expected a lot more and in the end it was just a story.I like that it was honest and there was no happy ending, that would be the truest ending of this story. This is the most important point of my review and I appreciate it. It's a slow-burn movie, with good photography and the culture of japan catches the eye. 6/10 because i expected much more, I wanted to feel the vibe of the movie more etc.It's a good movie but for my standards, it could be much better.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
the beauty of lost in translation,"Lost in translation - to me is about the fragile connection between two souls. It's about observing the alienation mirrored throughout the mundane events in the lives of these two characters.This movie isn't a love story and i don't think bob and charlotte were soulmates. I just think they're two lost souls in a foreign city who in a simple moment, forged a real intimate connection with each other. They simply were both in a time of their lives where they needed a friend. And these two strangers were able to find comfort in one another, not because they're in love but because they somehow have a mutual understanding of what it feels like to be in a room full of people and still feel alone. Alone and disconnected.They could sense each other's vulnerability and were able to open up to each other. They only know the present version of each other and sometimes that connection with a stranger can be just as intimate because a stranger doesn't need the details, they just listen.In a way, this movie feels so real and familiar. Everyone's had a time in their life when they've felt isolated from everything and everyone around them. A time in your life where you feel stuck and like you're just existing. And sometimes in those vulnerable moments of your life you doubt that there is another soul in the world who understands the way you feel. And that's why bob and charlotte's connection wasn't sappy or romantic, yet still so real.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The best American film of 2003 is a love letter to insomnia.,"LOST IN TRANSLATION is a love letter to insomnia. An American movie star (Bill Murray) in Tokyo shooting a whiskey advert, forms an unlikely friendship with the wife (Scarlett Johansson) of a young photographer (Giovanni Ribisi). Their age difference can be charted in decades, but they find common ground in jetlag at the Tokyo Hilton. He is smack dab in the middle of a midlife crisis and she is struggling to discover her newlywed identity. One gets the sense that neither of them is a stranger to hotel rooms, but both are strangers to their spouses. A chance encounter in a hotel lounge brings them together in their mutual discomfort, which dissolves the isolation each feels independently of the other. The performances resonate reality, and this reality overshadows the extraordinary coincidence of their meeting.   Bill Murray brings subtle warmth to his role, reminiscent of his supporting turn in RUSHMORE, but here, in sharing lead duties makes the viewer aware of just how talented he really is. His sense of movement, expression and comic timing are absolutely flawless, and it will be a crime if his performance is not recognized as the acting tour de force it is; it's easy to imagine Bill Murray now having the kind of career Tom Hanks has enjoyed over the past decade. Scarlett Johansson is mesmerizing in her emotional portrayal of an oft discarded newlywed, struggling to find meaning in her life, if not at least in her marriage. Her on-the-cusp-of-womanhood is as central a story mechanic as it is a framing device in many of the shots of the Tokyo skyline.This is one of only a handful films that has accurately captured the feeling of being a stranger in a strange land. The hermetic culture of Japan is a perfect background for this story, and the city of Tokyo is as much a star as any of the actors. Traveling ten or more hours by plane to a country where the language is different, and the culture unfamiliar does interesting things to one's perspective, and this film revels in those differences. Sofia Coppola has proven her knack for identifying these anomalies while recognizing the similarities that exist pan-culturally. Her gift at directing young actresses (both in this film and her first) is as apparent as her intuitive casting and precise use of music. She directs this film in a manner that recollects a memory, both painful and poignant, but uplifting. She has fashioned a story that never ventures beyond the probable, but always surprises. It's themes are universal, and if it recalls any past film at all, it is David Lean's Summertime, albeit with a more drastic May-December slant. It definitely does not look like an American film, and by using a predominantly Japanese crew has managed to instill a very Japanese feel. Marvelous. Simply marvelous.",,Anonymous,Comedy
One of the best movies of the 21st Century,"This is an understated triumph by Sofia Coppola. This tale of an unlikely friendship struck up between middle aged, Bill Murray, and recent college graduate and newlywed, Scarlett Johansson, is set against the backdrop of bustling Tokyo. Coppola, and the actors, do an amazing job at using the setting to truly articulate the characters' feeling of isolation and personal confusion over their personal lives. The relationship between Murray and Johansson is one of the purest and most natural kinships I can remember in modern film. This movie has its very funny and endearing moments. It is a beautifully told story about self-exploration and humanity. I have seen this many times and it never gets played out. This is close to a perfect and timeless movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Give It A Second Chance, If Needed","I admit I found it disappointing on the first look but I decided to give it a second chance and was glad I did. Only then did I appreciate Bill Murray's great performance and the wonderful photography in this movie. The vivid colors in here are really something to see. It's odd how some movies are so much better the second time around.This is a very, very low key film about loneliness and about being in a culture that is totally foreign to you where few people speak your language. In this case, it's Americans - or at least the main character of film (Bill Murray) - trying to cope in Japan.The film is almost two-in-one: a travelogue and a story. The former because you really get the feel of what it is like to be a non-Japanese speaking person in that country and what the customs of the people are in Japan, at least to some degree....and it's interesting.Murray is the star of the story and any plaudits he's received for his performance are well- deserved. His facial expressions alone are classic! Scarlet Johannson is the female lead and she, too, is interesting to watch. These two make for a fascinating ""odd couple.""",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Ever lived in a hotel in a foreign country?,"I thought his movie was well done. My husband had to live in Moscow, Russia, in a hotel room on and off for three years. I visited him several times. We both thought the writer nailed the weirdness of being in a huge, amazing foreign city, time changes, insomnia, and being unable (not unwilling, we both took lessons) to speak the language.I wandered around Moscow, (while my hubby was at work) rode the subways, visited places I never thought I'd go, (I walked INTO St. Basil's Cathedral!!!) but always felt like a ghost because I couldn't communicate in Russian. The scene where Scarlett Johansson's character went to that amazing temple and just kind of walked around REALLY hit home with me.So, aside from everything else, Coppola did a superb job of capturing the weird, ex-pat lifestyle.

Bored and Boring,"If you like Pina Colada,and other alcoholic drinks,If you leave long pauses,Cause it gives you time to think,If you like bad Karaoke,from collagenous lips,You will love Japan,where you never have to tip.The basic plot is similar to Woody Allen's Manhattan. A beautiful young girl (married this time) has an affair with a much older man, primarily out of boredom, and because his gentle jokes help pass the time.The movie start by discombobulating you by showing how madly different Japan is from America. The movie looks full of comic promise.The movie slows to a snail's pace, and nothing happens. At least a lot less of interest happens than on my own explorations of foreign cities. The film feels sloppily and lazily ad-libbed.The running joke is Japanese people persist in speaking Japanese, because they can't think of anything else to try to communicate with Americans. What is the matter with them? Why don't they speak the English?The biggest mystery of the film is how did it come to be that a young married middle class couple are living in a luxury Japanese hotel next to faded 70's action star there filming a Japanese whiskey commercial.The movie projects a mild racism, sneering at the Japanese, not as different, but as inferior. There is no affection or sympathy for them. They are often portrayed as robots or buffoons.Scarlett Johansson as Charlotte was a good casting choice. She is extremely beautiful, without being flashy or glamorous. She has a unique wholesome look. She confused me only once when she donned a short pink wig, and I did not recognise her. I usually have a lot of trouble telling female actresses apart.Bill Murray plays Bob Harris a faded, restrained, sad, hen-pecked, defeated character similar to Don Johnston in Broken Flowers, his earlier much more emotional and engaging film.The moral of the story is, if you are bored, money will not help.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Not a good movie - listless plot with little to offer.,"It had very little plot, and was not Oscar worthy for acting, directing, writing, or anything else.  There were random funny moments, but they were not amusing or frequent enough to make up for the plot.  Despite the apparent randomness of the plot, it really is fairly cliche in terms of Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson characters connecting.  The ending is obvious from miles away, and the only surprise is that the film ends so soon in terms of running-time (it's only about 90 min).  Visually it's a very bright movie.  If cinematography alone leaves you satisfied this movie might be worth your time.  If not, don't bother.  I'll give it a generous C, but only because it's short and there were some funny points.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Like a dip in the ocean on a cold winters night.,"That is how I perceive lost in Translation, a cold, time stopping, gut wrenching moment in time where it is just between you and the water.But Lost In Translation itself wasn't cold or gut wrenching, it was an experience like no other in cinema, the movie hardly seems to move along; as if stopped in time and allows the 2 main characters to flow freely in this strange, unknown even daunting environment which is Tokyo.What makes this film work so well? It requires nothing but Bill Murray (Bob Harris) and Scarlett Johansson (Charlotte something) to find a relationship based of each other's loneliness and subsequent choices in life that lead them to a particular moment in life which is ending up in Tokyo to fulfill a certain obligation, neither of which are joyful in doing so. The age difference between the two means there's no silly love chemistry, neurotic breakups or overly-dramatic events occurring throughout the film, which some have found to be particularly boring. But certainly not me, these two characters alone are able to support this film the whole way through with just a bond between each other than thats why Lost in Translation is like no other film.These two bond so well together throughout the film with experiences so down to earth yet in turn so uplifting when these two characters experience these to occasions together. Charlotte and Bob are both complete strangers in Tokyo, thats what makes the relationship with them work so well, the essence of surprise when not knowing another individual makes the movie that much more better to watch, from one scene to the next rather than learning about Bob or Charlotte we view them learning about one another from their perspectives.By the end of the film both performances from Johansson and Murray were equaled and satisfying, both showing the glory this film set out to have, and to that, hats off to Sofia Coppola for making such a wonderful film that was driven by effortless timing and character driven emotion.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
wonderful and beautiful,Faded movie star Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is in Tokyo to shot whiskey commercials. He's getting $2 million to endorse the whiskey. He's married for 25 years with kids. Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) is in Tokyo with her photographer husband John (Giovanni Ribisi) of 2 years. He's constant working and she feels lost. She's a recent philosophy graduate. She finds a fellow lost soul in Bob at the hotel bar. They both have difficulty sleeping.Sofia Coppola made a gentle beautiful movie. Scarlett is dressed down a little and she looks gorgeous. Then there is Bill Murray. He's having some fun and making little wisecracks. It's not anything terribly big. I love the hospital scene mostly because of the two Japanese women behind him.

You could learn more about Japan from a Viewmaster film than this movie,"I was greatly disappointed by `Lost in Translation'. I've been in the situation that Bill Murray's character finds himself in: at a loose end in a foreign country. The film captures the sense of alienation and time passing so slowly it seems stuck. It also nicely portrays Murray's character reaching out to Charlotte, the young woman who he meets in his hotel.However, I was disappointed by the film for two reasons. The first is that it has stunning photography of Tokyo and Kyoto but it views Japan like the two main characters do: through their hotel window. Even when they visit restaurants or night-clubs or in Charlotte's case, temples, the characters do not engage in their surroundings. They treat them as a substandard theme park or theme restaurant, poke fun at them and make fun of the people in them. They even poke fun at the doctors and staff in the hospital. (And what was wrong with Charlotte's foot? We were never told if her toe was broken or bruised although she was seen with a bandage on it.) I can see that Murray's character is there just for the money but Charlotte takes the time to visit temples and Buddhist sites so supposedly she has some interest in Japanese culture. The audience doesn't see much of it. The audience doesn't see much of the friends she has of Japan either.All of the Japanese - even the friends that Charlotte visits - are shown as laughable. Even if they don't speak bad English the audience is still encouraged to chuckle at them.I can see why some people would call the movie racist for this reason. But to be fair, all of the people in this movie are shallow. Especially Charlotte. She says that her husband thinks she is a snob because she sneers at the movie star and the LA scene. Charlotte doesn't show much more depth than the blond vapid film star:  the blond vapid film star actually says more interesting things that Charlotte does. Charlotte doesn't open a book once during the whole movie and doesn't say anything with any insight.It is because of this emptiness that I found the film so disappointing. The expression that Murray has on his face when Charlotte leaves the lobby at the end is moving, and so is the final scene. But the film didn't make me like either character. I could feel their loneliness and their culture shock but I didn't have much sympathy for either one of them. Stuck in Tokyo in a top class hotel for a whole week with what looks like an endless amount of cash to spend -- poor them! If I were in their shoes I wouldn't spend that much time in the hotel:  I would get out and try to see Tokyo and try to speak openly to the people I met even if they couldn't speak English well. And I would want to see a museum or two. Or a manga store. Murray and Charlotte don't even go shopping.I would love to know what the Japanese think of this movie. The photography is stunning, but many of the Viewmaster slides I had when I was young also had beautiful pictures of Tokyo and Japan. They showed more about the culture and more respect for the culture too.I would have loved it if before the end of the movie Godzilla stormed the Tokyo Hilton and squashed Bill Murray and Charlotte and all other smug characters who made fun of the Japanese to a pulp.I will say one thing in the film's favour: it didn't have any jokes about the food the Japanese eat. But I guess people have grown tired of jokes about sushi and all the food in Japan having suckers on it when every large city in the West has at least one hip sushi bar.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"""Let's never come here again because it would never be as much fun.""","No other movie has affected me more so than Lost in Translation - straight to my emotions, deep down into the very being of my soul. This film left an ache in my soul that lasted for several days and that continues to do so - this very day. Someone once told me that extroverts will hate it, and introverts will love it - and I tend to believe them. No other film, in my opinion, has divided movie fans, as much as this one has. The film is effectively about two lost souls in a foreign country, unsure of their surroundings, and their direction in life, who by fate meet each other.If six years later; Enter the Void was to represent Tokyo negatively, then Lost in Translation would do the opposite here. It is essentially a love letter to Tokyo from Sofia Coppola. The striking neon lights of Tokyo with the juxtaposition of the beauty of the temples that Charlotte visits. The modernity of Tokyo combines well, with the ancient customs and traditions - to invoke a sense of wonder to the viewer.The soothing use of music in the film, really adds to the sense of isolation and melancholy (I have listened to this soundtrack for the past ten years). Along with such locations as Joganji Temple, Heian Shrine and the Park Hyatt hotel to name a few being utilized. It is just breathtakingly beautiful.

Pretentious trash,"I have loved and hated many ""art films"" but never have I hated a movie so much as this one. Despite all the ridiculously undeserved hype and glorious acclaim I simply cannot understand why anyone would ever like this film. If critics had not given this trash such glowing reviews I would not loathe it so (though, I would still hate it), but I suppose once you ignore the clichés and literal nothingness of the movie then you can appreciate that the director's last name is Coppola. Hm. Frankly, I have watched whiteout dry on paper and water turn to ice and found that far more interesting. At least something is happening. If this is what makes directors famous then I might as well film whiteout and water and at least get rich doing it.Lost in Translation was honestly the most boring film I had ever seen. No exaggeration. ""Hilarious comedy"" my ass. I did not laugh once. My sister fell asleep twice; the second time she did she asked me not to wake her up. Shots of windows and Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansen saying nothing are boring. Empty, clichéd dialogue is boring. Japanese people who always exchange their ""L's"" for ""R's"" is boring and stereotypical.What was Sophia Coppola trying to tell us? That unhappy people sometimes meet each other and depend on each other's presence? That people can't communicate? (Ooh, ""Lost in Translation,"" of course! Clever, Miss Coppola, very clever.) This movie isn't ""subtle,"" it's boring. It does not evoke melancholy and moroseness (the choice emotions of the pretentious nowadays), it evokes nothing. Nothing happens.

A beautiful and subtle film about alienation.,"I, along with those who didn't like the film, found the movie boring. I also found it beautiful. That's because the theme of this movie is boredom. And that's clearly evident within the first fifteen minutes when the camera, the background music and the script depict the two lead characters' boredom with such a detailed illustration, such a deep passion. The beautiful solitary shots (like the one with Bob playing golf in his room) that presents the characters' sense of alienation in a foreign society are the assets of the film. The little things they did together, or the little talks they had are ultimately nothing in the busy everyday life one normally leads; but in their times of loneliness they were like heaven. And if you, the viewer, connect yourself to their boredom, you'll feel that too.This movie is also an example of how an excellent script can take the best out of the actors. See for Bill Murray, he's definitely not one of the best actors in this planet however good he is. But here he delivers a performance that would make any one those best actors quite proud. His subtle withdrawed nature with a sense of fine humor is excellent. Two particular moments: One is when he does the Roger Moore thing and the other is when he speaks to Charlotte about having kids. So contrasting moments, yet so fit together. For Scarlett Johansson, I've seen five of her films and after seeing this one I must admit this performance is of another level. Her character is intelligent and fun-loving, and she discovers something new in this world but she doesn't know how to deal with it. Johansson is flawless in that mood. Their chemistry is the film's another asset. They both come to realize that their relationship has no future, yet they want to utilize their unique bond every minute they stay together. The screenplay gives their deserved treatment (for example, when Bob confesses he doesn't want to go, Charlotte replies, ""So don't. Stay here with me and we'll form a jazz band."").Another interesting aspect of the film is how it describes Japan and the people. The flood of color and sound that represents the technologically advanced city of Tokyo and its fun-loving people are sometimes fruitfully contrasted with the solemn and peaceful atmosphere of the monastery that Charlotte visited. But Bob and Charlotte couldn't blend into any of them and it's nobody's fault. And sometimes their misadventures are quite hilarious, like the scene with Bob, the first ad director and the interpreter Ms. Kawasaki. All the Japanese actors in the film do not have much prior acting experience I believe, but they fit in excellently.Now I must finish my comment mentioning Sofia Coppola's name, because she is the true person behind this movie. As you see all the praises I've done regarding this film, all are her own brilliant work.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
breathtaking,"I'm ashamed to say that this was one of those films that I ""didn't get around to"" seeing in the cinema and somehow there was ""always something else"" to rent in Blockbuster a few months later. I really should be ashamed.The film is stunning, it effortlessly conveys what it REALLY feels like to be away from home, lost and lonely. The use of music and sound (or lack of it!) are touches of genius and the performances and stunning - Bill Murray with depth? who'd have thought it and Scarlet has to be the find of the decade.The use of members of the public as unknowing extras is a well tried trick to add realism into a film and seldom works, but here it adds to the whole mood of the film perfectly giving it the secret ingredient - totally believable characters and situations.Bittersweet in its plot, it kept reminding me of Last Encounter (silly as it sounds) and fears of spoiling it all with a sickly sweet ""Hollywood"" ending were thankfully unfounded.It's one of those rare films that you don't watch as much as let wash over you -never quite understanding what makes it so good or enjoyable. And yes, it passes the true test of a classic film - the fact that you're still thinking of it days and weeks afterwards.This really will go down as a classic and a reminder that Film as an Art form works best when people are its central focus and actors are allowed to act.

Perfect Sympathy in Mysterious Tokyo,"Two lonely Americans who feel isolated from their own partners meet and spend time in Tokyo. Lost in Translation (2003) is the story how they come to be in perfect sympathy with each other in a few special days as they try to plug up the holes in their hearts.The film is directed by Sofia Coppola (The Virgin Suicides 1999), who once worked in Tokyo and decided to use the city as the setting for her film. LiT was given many awards and received acclaim from critics and viewers all across the world.Some reviewers, however, have been critical of this movie because of what they claim is anti-Japanese racism. They say that Japanese in this movie are portrayed without dignity, as funny, ignorant and inferior to the American characters.I agree with some of what they say. For example, some reviewer says that none of the Japanese characters were portrayed as being human or having any feelings. I think so, too. For example, Bob is surrounded by short and similar middle-aged Japanese men in an elevator. They seem to have no feeling. As this, Japanese are described as the movie's background. Undoubtedly, Japanese in this movie are so ridiculous that some Japanese might angry.But Sofia Coppola didn't make the film to criticize Japan. In an interview at www.greg.org (August 31, 2003), she says about Japan, ""I've never been in another place where I really felt like it's another planet."" I think the most important thing for her was to put two American people in mysterious surroundings, someplace like Tokyo. The movie is about feelings of loneliness and sympathy. It has nothing to do with Japan.In fact, I think Coppola loves Japan. During the end credits, you can hear the song by Happy-End, a Japanese band interested in the protection of Tokyo's old street scene. One of Japan's famous artists, Keigo Oyamada, introduced Happy-End's music to Coppola, who liked the song at once. I think she understood not only the song's good sound but also its meaning as well. The song is her way of paying respect to Tokyo and Japan.LiT is surely a strange movie for Japanese, but it reminds us again of the mysterious attraction of Japan.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Beautiful and sensitive and very funny,"I saw this movie in the cinema in 2003 and was blown away by it. At the time I was a bit older than Charlotte. I saw it back recently and by now I am about the age as Bob. It blew me away again. Both characters are completely relatable, both being at a point in their lives where they are not quite sure where they are going and how happy they are. Add to that the alienation of staying in the self-contained bubble of an expensive hotel in a completely foreign culture and you have the perfect setting for a brief encounter. Two people who discover to their own surprise that, while they seem to have little in common, they are somehow completely compatible. Their growing friendship and (non-sexual) intimacy is beautifully portrayed. They both occasionally seem to consider whether they should take things further but that would no doubt ruin their connection and upset their lives. It is beautiful and so recognisable to see their hesitation. Haven't we all had such encounters that we knew would just be brief and intense, with a hint of melancholy about what could have been under different circumstances?The film is shot beautifully, with Tokyo as the perfect backdrop. The dialogues are sharp and witty, and Bill Murray has never been better with his deadpan comedy (the scene in the gym had me in stitches) and tender, melancholic glances at Charlotte. Scarlett Johanson did a great job too, and she was only 17 years old. I liked it that there is not really a plot but rather a meandering storyline in which we see the friendship between the characters develop. The ending is perfect. They both know that they will probably never meet again and that their connection was only meant to happen at that place and time. This was it and it was great while it lasted.

"Contrived, lacking a core of conviction, purpose, or authenticity","In Sofia Coppola's comedy of cultures Lost in Translation, Bob Harris (Bill Murray), a middle-aged American actor, is in Tokyo to film a whiskey commercial and earn two million dollars in the process. When he is not filming, he watches television in his room, goes to the bar, gets faxes and FedEx packages from his wife but there is little connection either to his family or to the world around him. When he meets recent Yale graduate in philosophy Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), the wife of a distant workaholic photographer (Giovanni Ribisi), the scene is set for romance but the only thing that meets is their minds. Both feel a sense of cultural isolation and there is always the suggestion of an adulterous romance but for a reason that is not explained, neither go there and there is little emotional content to their conversation.Bill Murray is one of my favorite actors and he is in top form, using his trademark dry wit to portray a jaded character but the film never really came alive for me, and I was uncomfortable with the many set pieces poking fun at Japanese language and culture. While we know that the attitudes are part of Harris' mindset, nonetheless the outlandish behavior of talk shows, incompetent translators, over-the-top Japanese masseuse, exaggerated stereotypes, and endless use of ""l"" and ""r"" language confusion only feed the fires of smugness and condescension. The director spent some time in Tokyo and experienced what it felt like to be alone in a foreign culture. While her experience may have been authentic, something has been lost in translation. I found the film to be contrived, lacking a core of conviction, purpose, or authenticity, a sorry contrast to Tsai Ming-liang's films about urban alienation that ring with a truth based on a profound understanding of place and time.Bob and Charlotte have the resources and time to travel, to discover their own humanity and the beauty of the culture they are in. Instead, all they do is go from one party to another desperately looking for fun. Coppola shows us the city's garish entertainment scene, its pachinko parlors, video games, talk shows, and karaoke but does not show anything that is endemic to Japanese culture. What we do see has been reduced to a class in flower arranging, a Buddhist temple, and a ride on the bullet train. In one of the few scenes that was genuinely moving, Bob and Charlotte sing at a karaoke club with Bob mouthing the words to Roxy Music's ""More Than This"". The moment comes alive but there is little more than this. Other scenes show promise but leave the viewer hanging. At the end of a party, Charlotte is wearing a pink wig and lays her head on Bob's shoulder as both stare into space to seemingly no purpose. Another sequence is at a golf course where Harris practices his swing against the background of the magnificent Fuji Mountains but the scene quickly switches to another as soon as he hits the ball.There are hints of a message but no coherent vision. The characters are lost but make no attempt to find each other or themselves, limiting their probing to a nighttime `Where are you from?' conversation that leads only to Bob's placing his hand over her foot. They watch La Dolcé Vita on television suggesting the comparison between the empty pleasures of Tokyo and Rome but no point is made that the artificiality reflects the influence of Western culture. Lost in Translation has some insightful moments as well as some very funny ones. What is sad is that Ms. Coppola misses every opportunity to allow her characters to grow or to experience something deeper about themselves and the world around them, content to display ennui as the only possible outcome.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A perfect movie,"If you were to go out hunting ""the perfect movie"" this must surely be it. Sofia Coppola shows the story of two people living in an alien world (in this case Tokyo).

Beautiful tale of love and loneliness,"Following The Virgin Suicides, Sofia Coppola turned to Japan as a setting for her next big project: Lost In Translation. The romantic comedy depicts the birth of a friendship (maybe more) between a middle-aged actor and a young woman who is staying in the same hotel.Lost In Translation was a big success back in 2003, earning itself Academy Award nominations, making an impressive profit and putting actress Scarlett Johansson on the map once and for all. Coppola's directing style proving very different to her father's but also very effective. The cinematography and excellent soundtrack give this film a dream-like quality that makes you want to get lost in Tokyo with these two characters. There's a familiar yet fresh vibe to this movie that makes its setting very approachable, very warm and cozy.Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson are frankly adorable together. Murray brings his deadpan hound-dog style of humor to the table while Johansson is not only charming as hell but funny also, giving a genuine, surprisingly layered performance. Both are terrific and give these characters something human, something real we can all recognize in ourselves. And so, the bittersweet ending works remarkably well, leaving you heartbroken but somehow refreshed.The film pokes fun at these characters' failure to quite grasp Japan's culture, but celebrates how different it is to the one that the characters are used to - which is exactly why they love it so much. The film then goes deeper to try and make us understand how these two vastly different people, at completely different stages in their lives, could fall for each other. There's true joy as you see these characters slowly get together, looking freer and happier than they've been in some time, we assume, and then shock when it turns out that the lives they dreamed of leaving behind are not something they are able to fully abandon. Perhaps they'll learn something from this Tokyo trip, or perhaps this short, powerful moment was all it could be.Written and directed with great care and attention, Lost In Translation is a beautiful little gem. So simple in the story it tells and how it tells it, but so inviting and compelling you'll never want to leave it.Cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"All surface, no feeling","Yes, the cinematography is gorgeous. And yes, the soundtrack's great, if not always appropriate. But sadly many otherwise intelligent people have been fooled by this surface gloss into thinking this is a piece of high cinematic art. It isn't.What it is is a mean-spirited little film about two spoiled Americans who, given an opportunity many of us would dream of - a week's free stay at a luxury hotel in one of the world's most exciting cities - do nothing but mope around moaning about how bored they are and how they can't sleep, occasionally breaking off to laugh at those crazy Japanese. The old ""flied lice"" jokes may have been funny when Benny Hill was doing them thirty years ago, but surely things have moved on? As well as an unpleasant vein of racism, there is also a seam of snobbery running throughout. Is Charlotte - lying around in her hotel room, living off her more proactive, more talented husband - really any better than B-movie starlet Kelly? The latter may be an airhead, but she has her own career and is enjoying the opportunity life has granted her while it lasts. And is Bob - who has travelled across the globe, missing his son's birthday in the process, just to prostitute his talent by filming a whisky commercial - in any way superior to the Japanese director and TV presenter he sneers at? Coppola clearly thinks so.Ah yes, Bill Murray. How ironic that an actor whose reputation was founded on the film Groundhog Day should spend the following years endlessly playing the same character with diminishing returns, fooling critics into thinking he's more than a one-trick pony with that hangdog expression. Which brings me to irony no.2. During the video shoot scene, Murray's character pokes fun at Roger Moore, as if to say that Murray himself is the vastly more versatile actor. He isn't.The film's one saving grace is Johansen who, despite the blankness of her character, lights up the screen every time she appears and has you looking at your watch when she leaves. A stunning performance, wasted on such otherwise vapid material. A film which promises an intellectual fix but ultimately says nothing.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A feast for the pseudo-enlightened?,"The weird dichotomy of reviews here seem to indicate a growing rift between film experts and we dull-minded amateurs. After all, the consensus among film critics and students seems to be that 'Lost' is a masterpiece, but the rest of us either 1) fell asleep, or 2) stayed awake by struggling to figure out the point. In fact, only a handful of the 300+ reviews here say it's just an average movie (the ruling IMDB elite say ""Oscar-worthy"" and the mindless masses say ""booooring""; few fall in or near the middle).So what? So we read the reviews and expected something uniquely brilliant, forged by a legacy of cinematic greatness. So we were let down and misled.I really get the feeling - and I'll just say this and shut up already - that the initial round of glorious reviews were hatched from a tiny elitist minority who, like us, struggled unsuccessfully to grasp the point but, unlike us, didn't have the courage to admit it. So instead they glossed over the missing plot and hailed the movie as something high-minded and profound, the vision of a beloved director (whose name they dare not condemn). And so then the oracle was passed to the indie squires that they too would praise this snoozer, lest they too expose their wretched lack of artistic sensibility.Here's to the brave folks who dared set the record straight on this one.

Am visiting Japan in a few weeks and can't wait to see some of the locations. I feel like Tokyo and Japan is just that sort of place.

Manhattan Of The 21st Century!,"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Her. Both of these movies have style, themes, or ideas which are similar to that Lost in Translation has. Therefore, either of them would make perfect bittersweet double feature with Lost in Translation. And I loved these two movies so much; however, I have some issues with each one of them.Don't get me wrong; Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind's script is more genuine and creative, but the main issue I have with it is that it lost its balance between humor and subtle pathos at some point. Lost in Translation, by contrast, doesn't have this problem. In fact, the perfect balance between humor and melancholy. The movie deals with heavy themes such as loneliness, insomnia, emptiness, existential crisis, and more hefty themes, but nonetheless the movie never feels gloomy or bleak. Actually there are some funny moments due to the movie's smart dialogue that made me laugh many times.As for Her, I think it is a very unique, and has an idiosyncratic style and screenplay, except for its third act. It chose a familiar and conventional way to end its one-of-a-kind story. That didn't just disappointed me, but that also made the movie feels inconsistent near the end. For a moment, I felt that Sofia Coppola would make the same mistake in Lost in Translation. That's because at some point at the third there was a scene that feels if it sets a subplot that would end the movie in a stereotypical way. And I think this was an unnecessary and manipulative. Also, this is the only main issue I have with Lost in Translation. This movie is bittersweet, but its ending is Just Like Honey!Both Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson at the top of their games. They may gave their best performances in their respective career. Scarlett Johansson did a great job in playing the Philosophy graduate Charlotte who is twenty-something. I felt she's really at this age. As for Bill Murray, his role is far more complicated, and he just killed it! I've never seen him giving such a powerful serious performance. His character suffers from something like a midlife crisis, and there are many great actors played characters like this before. But Murray's terrific comedic abilities adds to this character, and made it more complex, yet more amiable.Aside from the fact that this movie looks gorgeous, it's exquisitely directed by the talented director, Sofia Coppola. Just try to notice the visual tools, how they work, and utilized, and what they imply. You will find out that Lost in Translation is a well-directed as it's a well-written film, maybe the direction is what deserves the highest praise. Also, the movie is consistent in tone. As I mentioned, the balance between between humor and sadness, and while the smart screenplay has a major in that, the meticulous direction has a role that isn't, by any means, less important. The soundtrack is sweetly hypnotic! This is now one of my favorite soundtracks put in film. The words of every song match the current state in every different phase in the movie.I loved Lost in Translation so much! I can't praise it highly enough, or maybe I can, it's Manhattan of the 21st century!(9/10)",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
My personal favourite,"We follow two people in different stages of life. Their bond grows so strong over the course of this movie, that it feels so real.For me, this movie hit all the right marks - sentiment, melancholy, sadness, happiness, anger, loneliness and above all, deep, deep love for each other that is more than a sensual hunger.Charlotte and Bob couldn't have been more perfectly cast - Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray, respectively - and Sofia Coppola knew that well; she wouldn't have made the movie if Bill refused to take the role.But he accepted and what we ended up with is a nihilistic, romantic story that goes beyond the dialogue. We know the feelings of each character before they meet each other, and it's not hard to relate to them. Are you the young person, striving to be something bigger than yourself but not quite sure exactly what? Or are you the person that's a little fed up with life, slowly and quietly lives it out, seemingly numb to the good things in life?The brilliant mix of these two types of characters couldn't be expressed better than in a foreign place like Tokyo: lovely, beautiful but confusing and belittling, the perfect background for someone to have their heart on their sleeve. But only those that understand each other - both literally and figuratively - can read each others' heart.Bob and Charlotte connect quickly when they find out they have a lot in common, such as insomnia because of the jet-lag, a soulmate that seems to have lost their initial soul and their interest in each other, and they decide to explore the city together. Bob is a mentor, while Charlotte is a playmate that lets him appreciate life more than he did before.Their happiness won't last longer than a few days, because then they'll have to go their own ways again, but with some marvelous experiences to make up for it. This looms over them.Yes, it's quite a simple love story and not a lot of exciting stuff happens on screen - but what *does* happen is so sincere, so beautiful and detailed, and not to mention, it'll give you the occasional chuckle.What I might find most interesting about this film is that Bob Harris sounds a lot like Bill Murray and Charlotte is close to Scarlett - the line between acting and real life has, to me, faded so much that it's hard to tell the distinction. Bill Murray used to be a huge hit-actor and hadn't seen as much success around the time this movie was made. Bob Harris is Bill Murray. Charlotte's character is based on Sofia Coppola herself, and Scarlett, despite her young age, moves her character forward with so much grace and relatibility - for me, as a young person - that it's not hard to see why she became as big of an idol as she is these days.To me, this is my staple movie, the movie that makes me feel everything I want to feel and shows me everything I want to see. I can hardly put it into words. Needless to say, a movie worth watching.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A movie with aimlessness at its core...Murray is grounded but film intentionally meanders,"Despite an occasional misstep, I felt writer-director Sofia Coppola's sure-hand throughout this slight, occasionally lovely film about isolation finding an outlet in admiration. While not a love story per se, ""Lost in Translation"" is charming and almost-romantic as it ambles along, bringing two kindred spirits together. Coppola seems to excel in a forlorn melancholy that is as beautiful as it is perplexing (you may wonder, ""where is she going with this?"", but then just as quickly realize that a schedule here isn't the purpose). Bill Murray has some funny moments, and he is surprisingly at home with Coppola's low-key approach. There are a few awkward stops (an outburst at a party is perhaps more fuzzy than anything else), but Murray is comfortable in his scenes with quiet, dreamy-eyed Scarlett Johansson, and their repartee is beguiling. The simple plot--about the alienation any human being would feel in a foreign country--is character-driven, so it seems very slim (particularly in retrospect). Coppola lets sequences breathe and take their own shape; she stays out of Murray's way, but also manages to keep the actor grounded. The alt-rock soundtrack is moody and interesting, and the picture has an unfettering eye for the craziness of a desperately with-it Tokyo. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Poignant and smart, clearly somebody knew what they were doing!","Everything about this movie was both refreshing and original. The treatment of the setting (Tokyo shot entirely on location) was one of deep respect and honesty. Japanese culture, especially in relation to American culture, was portrayed intelligently as the lead characters tried to interact and break through the language barrier- thus the title ""Lost in Translation"". Bill Murray can't disappoint with his impeccable timing and smart delivery. Young Scarlett Johansson proves to be quite capable of holding her own with even an actor as experienced as Murray. The two contrasting personalities were able to carry the complex story as their characters found each other and formed an unlikely but solid bond.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Lost On Me,"Everyone seemed to be praising this flick when it came out, though why I'm not sure. I was just watching it again on cable and it just plain lame. The real title should be ""Stuck In Hotel"". It just doesn't go anywhere. The whole film should have been like that scene when they go out on the town, which is the only good part of the movie. But even that seems amateurish, with shots that are focus pulled in the middle (not rack focus either) and shaky shots and wild camera swings. It looks like it's edited together from outtakes only. And the writing . . . ? Was there actually writing involved here? It seems like it was all Bill Murray improvising, though if he actually had it probably would have been better. And the atmosphere scenes and the scenes of Murray working are forced and paced strangely. I know that Sophia Coppola was going for a disjuncted faded photo album feel here, and on that she succeeded. But was she also going for a boring, pretentious, student film feel as well? Because if she was, she succeeded beyond he wildest dreams. This is also a Chick Flick in a HUGE way, because Scarlett Johansson's character is cheating on her husband without actually having sex. Oddly as much as I dislike this movie, I don't hate it nearly as much as I should. Perhaps I just long for it's lost potential. I long for it to achieve something. This film, like many in modern cinema, crys out for some sort of triumph. Most people get enough disillusionment and disappointment in their everyday lives without having to go to the movies for it. Perhaps Coppola leads such a charmed life that 'Real Life' is what she longs for. The only real triumph in this movie is that Murray and Johansson's characters get a little slice of what a different life would be like.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Not What It Appears To Be,"On the surface, Lost In Translation is an excellent movie. After the first view however, it gets more complex.The plot is this; Bob Harris, a middle-aged actor whose star is fading, takes a trip to Japan to do a whiskey advertisement. His wife chooses not to come presumably she must take 'care' of the children. Charlotte is a newly-wed whose workaholic husband neglects but doesn't have enough courage to admit he doesn't want her there. Charlotte and Bob are both lonely people, unable to find company or solace in their work/partners. They meet by chance in a hotel bar (they are staying at the same hotel) and strike up an unusual friendship.Sofia Coppola has perfected these characters, and gotten inside them completely, so that when watching, one can actually FEEL what the actors are feeling. The immediate attraction between Charlotte and Bob is obvious, and what they have is more than a friendship, its a total acceptance of each other, and who they are.Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson have great chemistry on screen chemistry together and perhaps this, and the excellent script, is what makes the friendship so plausible. While i watched the movie, I felt like I was there beside them each step of the way, and, I'm not ashamed to admit, my eyes did well up at the end. Truly a masterpiece.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"A very real, human film. It could happen to you.","Let's take a moment to appreciate how real this movie is, no Hollywood westernized gimmicks that I could perceive. This movie is very human. I forgot I was watching a film, and instead had an experience that I was totally involved in, which rarely happens. This is also a movie with a high rewatchability rate. It is perfectly shot, and the style of storytelling hides in the details. It's not pretentious, as a lot of movies of this caliber and style are, nor does it dumb things down. It was very warm, in fact. Finally, it reminded me why I've always wanted to go to Japan. The thing is, you don't have to go to Tokyo to feel lost in translation with people. But you do have to feel lost in order to be found. I would say that Tokyo, besides being a real place & setting in this film, can be used as a metaphor just as effectively. But really what I enjoyed the most is the connection between Charlotte and Bob. At first there's a mutual understanding. There's definitely friendship. Then there's an odd father-daughter relationship, which finally moves onto romantic attraction. But the whole time the two characters are somehow on the same page, on the same level. They have more in common with each other's existential state, which can be seen as the most profound kind of connection two people can share at any time. Unfortunately, it's not the kind of connection than can go anywhere, realistically. They can't be together in the normal understanding, and they never initiate their relationship or cross any boundaries. I don't know, man. This movie is like Zen Buddhism. It's satisfyingly simple and minimalist, yet it contains the deepest truths about the human condition. WITHOUT being pretentious. It's the kind of experience you feel. We may watch films with our eyes, listen to them with our ears, but Lost In Translation speaks to another kind of sensory perception, if you can call it that. It is very ambient and sensuous. You feel as if you're there. I think it's great. There were some genuine laughs and there were a lot of scenes that I feel like weren't acted at all, there's a strong authentic feel to every scene that is extremely rare to come by in movies these days.

Unusually platonic love story,"Lonely in the biggest city in the world, two disparate people find companionship in Tokyo. Bill Murray is amusing as Bob Harris, a middle-aged, po-faced movie star who is 'reduced' to making whisky ads in Japan (albeit for two million dollars) and his interactions with his handlers and with the more offbeat aspects of Japanese media-culture provides most of the film's humour. Seventeen year-old (and pre- Hollywood-superstar) Scarlett Johansson's character (Charlotte) is more subtle, and her vulnerability and uncertainty is a perfect foil to Harris' superficial 'wise-guy glibness'. Not a lot happens, and although it has 'aged-well', I found the film a bit slow-moving on a second viewing but the characters are engaging and the odd trajectory of their 'romance' is compelling.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Murray is the man!,"Really one of the best films I've ever seen. It exemplifies how we are all different, yet very similar at the end of the day. Bob and Charlotte could be anyone anywhere on the planet, but I think choosing Tokyo was important because it is such a diverse cultural hub with people from all walks of life as we see displayed throughout the film with the business men, singer, actresses and actors ect.Everyone in Tokyo is seemingly so energized by their career and what they are doing in life that Bob and Charlotte become connected due to sharing how lost they both are in life, love and their own happiness. It was less about sexual and physical energy or attraction and more about the intellectual bond and understanding of two Americans out of place not just in Tokyo, but in life and their place In it. Sofia Coppola really made a masterpiece here which anyone whose ever risked it all in life and gotten spit out can empathize with. Charlotte spent all her time at Yale majoring in philosophy and Bob spent his life making movies and both were thrown away by their respective industries. Bob professes to Charlotte how he could be doing plays back in the states ( his passion of acting) and Charlotte is listening to useless philosophical CDs trying to help her define what exactly her place or passions even are!I think when I was younger it was hard to grasp the nuances of this film. One being Bob is an older man with a wife and kids who is kind is hitting on someone much younger with her whole life ahead of her. I think optically it looked funnier then because I couldn't see how Bobs wife and even kids have essentially thrown him away and are fine without him during his time in Tokyo. Charlotte is also essentially thrown away by her Husband, Giovanni Ribisi who openly flirts and disrespects her in plain sight. They are being treated like trash by a world that worships success and laughs at those who didn't make it, got thrown away or don't know what they want in life.Murray was perfectly cast as the movie star now having to do soulless commercials in Japan he doesn't care about the work aside from keeping the money rolling in for his families lifestyle. His deadpan delivery and aloof attitude make the film. Anyone that's been at a job and just no longer gives a damn knows what he's going through. As they leave each other before the credits we can speculate on what Bob whispers to Charlotte as they both go back to their sad existence.I would speculate they shared love for one another and perhaps Bob will come
Back to Japan to start a new life with Charlotte. Maybe they will buy a house by the Sea of Japan and live out the next years in happiness and love. Alternatively, they go on with their lives and are unhappy/ miserable; perhaps Bob goes back to acting in Plays and perhaps Charlotte gets involved at a university in Japan where she can become a teacher, unfortunately they would still be thrown away and not cared for
By those they held dearest because the natural progression of their life has drifted them apart from their current spouses. Don't miss this film, I could cry at how wonderful of a story this is,

A film that challenges the meaning of purpose in clear contrast with perceived notions of nobility and traditional expectations of commitment,"It would serve better as a film to be called 'Caught in the headlights'.

Over the course of their stay they uncover a shared depth in one another which gives birth to an inevitable but unacknowledged friendship which blooms into something that could be so very much more. The irony that both are tied by social expectation and convention elsewhere and yet clearly anchored together by a much deeper connection and sense of understanding for the emptiness that surrounds them makes it all the more challenging to watch without hoping for them to make the right choice.

"Sexless, Vulnerable, Extraordinary Intimacy","A couple distills, develops and preserves an extraordinary intimacy with their unspoken but deliberate and determinate decision of not having sex. For grownups who have learned how to handle sex, emotion, and relationship, this sexless intimacy may be possible only conditionally. In the case of Lost in Translation, Scarlett Johansson's innocence and Bill Murray's sense of lost snowballs untouchable vulnerability between their interactions. It's fairytale-ish, miraculous, obviously rare, but highly coveted, proven by the film's smash hit (in a small budget film scale).The description of Tokyo, especially its subculture scene, is surprisingly unbiased and harshly real. Kudos to director Sofia Coppola who captured the very true moment of a Japanese punkster, singing a Sex Pistols line ""There is no future in England"" in a karaoke bar.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Interesting but not too deep really,"Well the Oscar crew went wild for it because it was a bit different and a bit more thoughtful. Bill Murray and the cast do a great job, there are lots of clever moments and funny ones too. American Beauty seems to have kicked off a trend for more meaningful films from Uncle Sam but the probability is that Big Business in movies will always want ""blockbusters"" with ""stars"" to get maximum profits. So this type of film will always be a quirky minority film which the Oscars will flirt with now and again, but not too often.A pretty good film but there are loads of good films being made all the time outside Hollywood that are just ignored, this film was fêted because it was American.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I Was Lost in the Eyes of Scarlett and Bill,"This is a film, written and directed by Nicolas Cage's cousin, about either absolutely nothing or absolutely everything. Two strangers meet in Japan where nobody speaks English - not even subtitles - and both conspire to cheat on their spouse, though neither of them admits it or ever really acts on it. Bill Murray plays a washed-up alcoholic actor who suffers a mid-life crisis and enjoys long walks on the beach. Scarlett Johannsson also stars, being primarily a scantily-clad young vixen who is placed in this film for no really obvious reason other than to sexually frustrate the male audience for months on end. Despite the fact she is hideously deformed in real life, her Hollywood beauty shines through in this film. Anna Faris appears playing Cameron Diaz and being just ditsy enough not to be appealing or interesting. Lots of really cool things happen, but the bottom line is that life is simply a series of phases - in one, you love ponies - in a second, it's photography - and in the third phase, you lust over a wrinkled old lush twice your age. This movie is really highly recommended by both myself and the critics, though damned if I know why.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A different kind of love,"Yes, it has its slow parts.But this movie leaves one both happy and melancholy.Bill does an OK job and Scarlett does a really good job. The rut of Murray's character is deeper than his counterpart's.Just the same, the growing liaison which develops throughout, is uniquely charming. It's merely a bond of friendship with a smoldering flame of romance underneath the surface that can never be realized, but certainly dreamt about. That's the best way I can describe it.Bill's character merely has fun with her, ever unassuming, which leads to the growing endearment of both to each other with each meeting.They give the audience more time with Bill's plight in life than Scarlett's. With Bill's character, it's a marriage of many years that is apparently one of love, but where all romance, passion and laughter has long since been lost.Scarlett, being decades younger of course, has a love as well, but seemingly in its infancy and her Beau is still at the age where he likes to party with his buddies. Just the same, a good and caring fellow.The Climax fits the movie perfectly.Finally, since the location is Japan, the activities and culture are kind of fun.This movie defines 'bittersweet' quite well.It's not a DVD we put in the player too often, but we do enjoy and appreciate its quasi love story. It certainly is a welcome departure from most movies in the romcom genre.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Lost in Boredom,"I was appalled that Sofia Coppola won an Oscar for her drab screenplay. First of all, the characters were unsympathetic and out of touch with the world.  An actor receiving 2 million for a few days work and a directionless Yale student tagging with her photographer boyfriend.  I doubt many of us here have the privilege to be bored in the most expensive hotel in Japan.The stylized ennui of the whole pic was so pretentious.  Scarletts panty shots and staring at the window didn't elevate or convey any emotion at all. I really had to force myself awake at times when the whole film veered into an extended travelogue or a home movie.  I kept on waiting for the nonexistent plot to arrive.Finally, the 'crocodile dundee' style racism showing the Japanese as one dimensional morons or subservient.  The prostitute scene was a cheap play for laughs.  Much like, most of the Japanese scenes which were the 'look at the wacky Japanese' variety with the help of Bill's snide comments.  If Sofia wanted to portray loneliness and isolation, she could have easily done it without the racist undertone.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The reviewers and pseudo-intellectuals like it because it's soooooo real.  If I want real, I'll walk around town or sit in a hotel bar.  If I want Murray in a comedy, I'd much rather watch Groundhog Day over and over again............now THAT was funny and poignant.

Sometimes You Have to Be Lost to Be Found,"Lost in Translation is one of those movies that you walk out of and buy another ticket for the next showing. It is storytelling at its finest, with beautiful direction, an enchanting script, and a perfect cast. Writer/Director Sophia Coppola's magic story keeps you wanting more, even after the movie ends. The only thing more astonishing is that it is even better upon your second viewing.In a part written directly for him, Bill Murray is flawless in the role of Bob Harris, a movie star going through his midlife crisis. But Murray doesn't just play Bob Harris, he is Bob Harris. He looks deep into the soul of Bob's character, and makes us forget about the Bill Murray we know him to be.Scarlett Johansson, in her first major role in a motion picture, is absolutely fabulous. When you look into Scarlett's eyes, you can see the trouble she is experiencing with her husband John, and you can see her desire to be a free spirit once again.Bob Harris (Murray), a movie star on the downside of his career, travels to Tokyo in order to film a commercial for a whisky company. He has a wife and children who are all dissatisfied with him, and he's dissatisfied with them, as he goes through his midlife crisis alone on the other side of the world.Charlotte (Johansson), a recent philosophy graduate from Yale, moved out to Tokyo with her husband John (Giovanni Ribisi). John, a photographer, seems to spend more time working with starlets than with his wife, causing Charlotte to question not only her marriage with him but also her very existence, looking at a dark and cloudy future.As if by chance or because of their dissatisfaction with their lives, Bob and Charlotte meet in the bar of their hotel. They are able to form a relationship with each other, despite the age barrier between them. When Charlotte's husband has to leave for the weekend, Bob is all she has. Their experiences over this weekend, alone, are what make Lost in Translation.Lost in Translation may seem like your typical love story, set against an age gap separating two lovers. But it is so much more than that. It is a love story that was never meant to be. Fate is what brought these two together, and although short, their time together was unforgettable. Whether they are together in the end or not is irrelevant, because the time they shared together is all they needed.Sophia Coppola will no longer live under her father's shadow. With a modest four million dollar budget and little experience she managed to make a masterpiece. Two lost souls manage to find happiness in a city foreign to themselves. Sometimes you have to be lost to be found.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A masterpiece,"Lost in Translation tells the story of two lost souls, one an aging film star played by Bill Murray and the other a newly-married graduate played by Scarlett Johansson. Both are stuck in emotional torture because of neglect by their respective spouses and both are suffering from insomnia in a Japanese five-star hotel. These common-bonds result in the two of them forming an unlikely, but electric, connection in the hotel bar. The pair then take in Tokyo together, their friendship developing brilliantly but they are never being able to take it one step further.This is perhaps the best 'indie' film of the 21st century so far. The acting is superb and Coppolla's smart script and even smarter direction put the characters across brilliantly. Ultimately the film's biggest asset is the subtlety of its stars' performances and the subtlety of its direction. This subtlety made it a let down for many people. The film was marketed as a kind of slapstick, lighthearted rom-com and admittedly the moments with the Japanese ad-men are utterly hilarious but the film is a character study. I remember expecting the former but being surprised, and delighted, when I found it to be the latter.Its a triumph for all involved. Anyone who doesn't feel moved by the 'goodbye' scene clearly has no heart, the acting is outstanding. Coppola's tight direction, and good use of music, ensures that the film never drifts into schmaltz and that real emotion is what carries us through the film.I feel sorry for all involved that Return of the King came out in the same year. If the Acadamy knew their arse from their elbow The Two Towers would have got the trilogy's Oscars, allowing this to clean up in 2003.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Sarcastic and Slowly PacedA Narcissistic New Wave Type Film,"As Professional Movie Critics Pour Over Countless Films, of which most are Mediocre, Awful, and a Few that are Good to Great, it is Believably Refreshing to Encounter Off Beat and Against the Grain Film-Making and a Euphoric Sense of Finally...something Different. Praise the Lords of Movie Making.That seems to be what has Occurred here as this Dry and Sometimes Delightful Slice of Upper Class Life has been Awarded Highest Honors Across the Board.Some may be Bored but Anyone who Watches a lot of Films and are Formulaically Frustrated by So Much of the Same will most Likely be at least Grateful for a Change of Pace.Pacing is the Thing here, as is a Laconic and Laid-Back Style that is Contrasted between Two nearly Catatonic Gazers and the Brightly Lit Tokyo with its Flashing Colors and Confined Spaces. Bill Murray is Spaced Out and Scarlett Johansson Relates.These Two find Each Other and Their Pain is Subdued somewhat in a Budding Relationship of Shared Melancholia. The Nightlife, Through Karaoke and Get Together, Enliven the Displacement of Their Situation and Both manage to Rise above the Strangeness of the Land.The Film is a Confident, if Narcissistic, View by Director/Writer Sofia Coppola, and She manages to Make a Myopic Movie that Simmers with Delight but Never really Consummates. It is all Low-Key and Frustratingly Introspective most of the Time and its Charm is Bill Murray's Performance that is Spot-On and Sarcastically Funny.This is Japanese Bashing that could be Called Racist and most of the Humor is Laid at the Small Feet of Tokyo's Citizens. Maybe a bit too Much. It Brings the Thing Down somewhat as the Humor is often Cruel and Borderlines on Subtle Sadism.But it is Saved by its Quiet Quirkiness and as Stated Above will be More Embraced by Those who Watch a lot of Films.

Unspeakable Disaster,"I could not watch all of this film - in fact I stuck it out for about 45 minutes before I threw in the hat. I kept saying to myself, ""This film won an Oscar for best original screenplay?"" I could not believe it. I could not believe that such a banal, vapid, incomprehensible and utterly dull script won an Oscar, but then Hollywood in general has descended into the lower depths of Hades where apparently it will languish forever. Sofia Coppola, of course, is a Coppola and a female and she can make a film. With credentials like those who cares if the film is a blistering bore with a storyline so whacked that trying to make sense of it is utterly impossible. Ms. Coppola knows nothing about life - like virtually all of the young people in Lotus Land - and because she knows nothing about life she couldn't tell the truth even if she were threatened with decapitation.

Finally... a film that is human.,"At first I was confused and a bit disappointed when the credits began to roll. The movie had no climax, no real breakthrough, no resolution. But... as I realized, sometimes neither does life. What this movie does spectacularly is make you feel in a way you've never felt before, the bitter melancholy of life, the knowledge that things could have been and perhaps never will be. The setting in Japan makes the two protagonists feel even more isolated, and perhaps drawn to each other, two lost souls in an unfamiliar place. In consistency with the theme of the movie, I offer a word to describe the emotion which movie makes you feel - Saudade, the feeling of distance and loss suffered by the families of men off at sea during the age of Portuguese discoveries.Also, if you like this film I recommend listening to the song EDEN - rock + roll.

How lives of two different people gets mixed up with genuine looking incidents and how they are a support to each other is beautifully demonstrated. The frustration of not understanding the language is very natural and this thing steals the show. The acting was good. Although some of the roles were shown to be inserted unnecessarily. People get bored and get into activities and thus meet some new incidents. From the starting I was waiting that something FAST would happen. But nothing like that happened.

Coppola's breakout film still translates nearly two decades later,"The early 2000s were filled with films in which middle-aged actors who were perhaps just starting to reach the outer limits of their careers were recognized for quality work in indie films. 2003's 'Lost in Translation' is exhibit A of this trend, as Bill Murray played what could almost be considered a caricature of himself as a ""past his prime"" actor who finds work across the Pacific in Tokyo.Sofia Coppola's first major, critically acclaimed effort as director generated a lot of buzz (and biz) around its release, and its Academy Award for best original screenplay was well deserved. At the center of 'Translation' is the relationship that forms between Murray's Bob Harris and Scarlett Johansson's twentysomething Charlotte - a role that is really considered a breakout by many (sorry 'Eight-Legged Freaks'). Both Bob and Charlotte feel like prisoners in a foreign city, with neither of them really wanting to be there. Yet over the course of the film, we see an unlikely friendship develop, with some lessons learned along the way.The fact that 'Translation' is set in a city in which English is a second language also adds to its uniqueness, as it's another element that makes the two protagonists feel even more isolated. It's interesting that this film did not set off a domino effect of many others trying this out for effect.'Lost in Translation' is a little quirky, a little unorthodox, but a lot entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I'd rather be lost ANYwhere else,"I now know what it's like for those who didn't enjoy ""Return of the King"" and thus are in the minority opinion, exasperated as to how the masses could love it so (I found it to be one of the finest examples of moviemaking on record).  Despite the lauding of this movie as ""beautiful"" and ""perfect"", I found it to be highly uninteresting at its best, nearly pedophilic at its worst.This is just NOT a good movie.  I feel like George and Jerry when they're describing their collaborative sitcom as being ""about nothing"".  Well, this isn't far off.  The completely unbelievable premise of a sad-sack, whiskey-soaked Murray and his troubled 18-year old co-star forging a bond that ultimately comes close (but doesn't get there, thankfully) to sexual is made worse by obviously inexperienced direction, a cliche-riddled script and slower-than-molasses pacing.  A few scattered dalliances around town and a lot of grimaces and despair between the two leads ultimately ends up in -- you guessed it -- nothing happening.  Goodbye, back home we go, our unnatural attraction unrequited.I know that the tendency is to believe the majority and discard the voices of the few dissenters, but this is one of those rare cases where the majority is deeply in the wrong.

Simple but conveys so much,"Sofia Coppola has made many interesting films but Lost in Translation is the one I hear about the most. Having finally seen it, I can say it's pretty great.Lost in Translation follows Bob, a married actor, and Charlotte, a young married woman, who form a bond after meeting with each other in Tokyo.It's crazy to think that a low budget film like this which was shot within a month with a relatively unknown actress at the time is still being analysed to this day. It goes to show how amazing stories can be told regardless of the budget you have.This is one of those films I feel will grow on me over time and with repeat viewings. There's so much to appreciate with the way Sofia Coppola made this film. Choosing Tokyo as the setting was a wonderful choice. Staying in an unknown part of the world as well as the language barrier present made me understand the loneliness felt by these two characters. The struggle Bob and Charlotte go through with their troubled marriages is conveyed beautifully by Coppola. It's done in a way that doesn't draw much attention to itself but we're still able to understand the thoughts and feelings of these two people. Coppola's script is also fantastic. The interactions between characters feel so real and play such an important role in creating and developing the bond between Bob and Charlotte. There were obvious routes Coppola could've taken with a story like this but I liked how she didn't resort to those clichés.The acting is extremely good. Scarlett Johansson did a great job conveying the loneliness and depression of her character. She really proved herself here to be an amazing actress. Bill Murray is the one who stole the show for me. His performance is not showy at all but so much can said about his character through the subtle expressions given in his performance.Lost in Translation is brilliant. Sofia Coppola proved herself to be a talented writer and director here. The only reason my rating is an eight eight now is because the film didn't connect with me as much as I would've liked. There are other movies like Her and Anomalisa which have resonated with me more but I feel after a few rewatches, Lost in Translation may bring out the same effect those two films did to me.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Adults behaving cautiously.,"Fading movie star Bob Harris ( Bill Murray ) arrives in Japan for a big pay day doing a whiskey commercial. There he meets Charlotte, the bored wife of a photographer on assignment ( Scarlett Johanssen ) and the two spend of the rest of the picture alternating goofing on the Japanese and treading lightly around intimate feeling.Writer, director Sophia Coppola infuses Translation's melancholy bent with some striking imagery, energized editing and carefree nature as the two leads contend with Tokyo neon and culture in basically an action-less film where confusion and monotony is the catalyst. The late night bar scenes at the hotel create an ideal atmosphere for quiet desperation and tempered by Murray's craggy face dead panning evokes Antonionni with a sense of humor. The simmering sexual tension between the two begins to wear thin after awhile though and Coppola's compromising positions and pregnant pauses begin to repeat and fail to move the story forward. The open ended climax informed by an inflated music score and a step up in the emotion department simply fails to register or live up to the film's first hour and Lost just wanders to its mottled conclusion.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Bored in Japan as under-written and over-directed by Sofia Coppola,"Yes, Bill Murray, in a tailor-made role, is excellent and memorable. Even in a weak movie, he was probably worth of being considered for an Oscar nomination.   However, in my humble opinion, this is a wanna-be art-house film masquerading as a movie that succeeds in neither endeavor.  The Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay nominations are ridiculous.Scarlett Johanssen and Bill Murray are two bored, disaffected, cynical, and self-absorbed Americans who are emotionally distant with their spouses. We spend two hours watching them make fun of a Tokyo they refuse to make the effort to understand or get personally involved with.  He's there, his acting career 20+ years behind him, to film a series of Suntory whiskey commercials.  She's there because of her husband's work as a photographer. They make fun of friends and acquaintances and their own spouses for their superficialities. She quickly diagnoses that he is in typical middle-age male crisis; he quickly admits to it.  They poke fun at the absurdity of life, and basically enjoy a platonic ""affair"" -- a loose and transitory union of two lost souls with little better to do, who recognize that misery loves company.That's it -- that's the entire script of the movie.  Period.  The rest is all ""intriguing"" camera angles revealing the shallowness of Japan, about 36 of Bill Murray's best deadpan facial expressions, all three of Ms. Johanssen's facial expressions, and an uninspired soundtrack.In short, nothing happens, and unlike better-albeit-flawed art-house films like My Dinner at Andre's, nothing intriguing or remotely philosophical is explored.  This is actually reminiscent of 1973's ""a Touch of Class"" without the sex or the contrived situations.  given a choice of watching relentless ennui or sex and contrived situations, I'll take the latter every time.All of this, and most especially the absence of traditional contrivances such as plot and resolutions, makes it hip and original and a darling of the critics.  For those of us who travel for business, it's a two-hour compilation of the evenings we spent in various cities between appointments hanging out at hotel bars with nothing better to do.  This is boring in your own life and even less interesting watching two people who give you no reasons to care about them -- since they don't care about themselves or anybody else -- being even more bored.This also reminded me quite a bit of 2002's ""About Schmidt"", but not quite as pathetic.  About Schmidt made an additional mistake not made here -- casting Jack Nicholson as a midwestern Mr. Everyman!I think it's ludicrous that no American female has ever been nominated for Best Director before Sofia Coppola.  The only thing more ludicrous would be if she were to win the award for this pretensiously underwritten time-waster.This should have been called Bored in Japan -- just a tad more interesting than watching your Uncle Mike's vacation movies -- and even then, only if your Uncle Mike were not played by the ever-amazing Bill Murray.  If you are an industry professional trying to impress your colleagues, you probably will enjoy ""Lost in Translation.""  If you wish to be entertained, rent something else.",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A movie about two people stuck in their marriages,"Well! I couldn't say if the two characters are actually stuck in their marriage i.e. Are out of love with their partners or just facing some sense of disconnection with them. Bill Murray's character is going through a midlife crisis whereas Scarlett Johansson's character is feeling detached with her husband besides also feeling unsure about her future. Both of them feel lost in the city of Tokyo as the culture and language is very alien to them. The two strengthen their friendship while bonding over the fact that both of them are experiencing a foreign culture as well as feeling dissociated with their partners. The themes of romance in the movie is definitely not conventional.For me personally, the movie was quite boring as I couldn't relate with the plot at all. But I'll give it the benefit of doubt as I'm very young and I wouldn't have the experience to understand the nuances of the film. I believe for people in unhappy marriages, this movie would portray their reality and for them it could be a masterpiece, for me, not so much. The movie was very slow paced and I believe it was intended to be that way. Even when the characters were having fun it felt very monotonous to me. It isn't a film for the average audience in my opinion, would like to see it again after10 years to see if my aging has changed my opinion.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Such a zen experience,"I've given Lost in Translation an 8/10, but the more I think about it and digest it the more it starts to creep towards a 9/10.It's just such a calming movie experience. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson were excellent. They were so easy to sympathise with, to relate to, and to enjoy spending 90 minutes with. They played their roles with such tenderness and thoughtfulness, and crafted such interesting characters. Their interactions felt so real and genuine, which is a testament to Coppola's excellent writing.As well as this the direction from Sofia Coppola was brilliant. The entire film had such a cool vibe, tone, and style. You could pretty much pause the film at any moment, print out the frame and hang it on your wall. Lost in Translation is highly accomplished from a technical perspective.Fantastic!",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Hype aside, this is an okay film, but nothing to write home about","I'm flabbergasted by the hype surrounding this film. It does indeed have some charm and the opening shots of Tokyo remind one of Woody Allen's 'Manhattan, but as a love story? Not! It's easy to see that the camera loves Scarlett Johanssen, and she is lovable, but the plot goes nowhere and the blood of this film is thin and watery, rather than red and robust. Bill Murray's acting as a sour old codger doesn't remind me of anything but someone wandering around on tranquilizers. The screenplay is not exceptional, but the director does show promise and some genuine talent that is really her own. I give this film a 6 for effort.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Boring, boring, boring.","A boring movie about boring people acting bored and being bored and boring the audience. A few good lines in the movie where one might crack a subconscious smile, but not a real smile, certainly not a giggle. There is no action, just Bill Murray playing Bill Murray, moping around Tokyo, boring everybody he meets. Scarlett Johanson sitting around looking bored. This is the worst movie I've seen since Neighbors. Anyone who watches this movie will sit there thinking, hoping, that eventually something will happen, that there will be a laugh, or something, anything, will happen to break the slow motion dragging along, wondering if they should get up and leave now or have faith that maybe something is going to happen, but it never does. If theaters gave refunds when people were dissatisfied with a movie, this turkey would have been dropped like a hot potato the third day out. I have lost all faith in critics. I guess they think this movie was deeeeep.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Offensive and overrated,"A lot of reviewers here have remarked on how ""boring"" this film is. It IS boring, but the way I see it, that's only the beginning of the problems with this movie.I found it offensive the way this film portrayed Japanese people. From the bizarre, creepy behavior of the female masseuse to the hyperactive photo shoot director, this film seems to delight in poking fun at the Japanese. (Never mind the fact that the depictions have no basis in reality and are, in fact, based on shallow, inaccurate American stereotypes of the way the Japanese supposedly behave).As far as Bob Harris's ""plight,"" I found it hard to understand, relate to, or even care about. This is someone who seems completely miserable and like a fish out of water in a totally alien and foreign culture. The problem is, it's hard to have sympathy for his character. After all, this already-rich character is getting paid $2 million for a few days of ""work,"" (which in his case means sitting in a studio being photographed for a few minutes).It's hard to care at all about either Bob Harris or Charlotte. Neither character has anything interesting to say. Neither character makes the slightest effort to connect to their new surroundings. Neither can be bothered to even learn a couple of Japanese phrases (although Harris is constantly annoyed that the Japanese can't always speak perfect, fluent English).Harris is, in fact, a major jerk. He can't either be bothered to chat a few minutes with a couple of fans in the hotel bar. (One thing that always annoys me about Hollywood prima donnas is that they tend to forget who signs their paychecks). Speaking of the hotel bar, Harris seems to spend most of his time there, wallowing in his ""misery,"" instead of getting out and exploring his surroundings. (Which is a shame. I know from experience that Tokyo is in fact the world's most exciting and fascinating city---it makes LA or New York seem positively dull).I also found it hard to relate on any level to the Charlotte character. Scarlett Johansson drifts through this film with a vacant, deer-in-the-headlights expression. She simply doesn't seem very bright--and she, like her co-star, makes absolutely no effort to connect in any way with her surroundings. In fact, I've traveled with people like her in the past (they're the ones who're always wondering where the nearest McDonald's is in places like Europe). In short, they're boring folks, and I certainly have little desire to see such people depicted in a film.Speaking of which, I can't comprehend why this film garnered such rave reviews. I can only guess that it has something to do with the fact that Hollywood is so completely creatively bankrupt these days.Either we get films based on comic books or video games or 1960s TV series, or we get mindless explosions and violence. If you're looking for a film that doesn't have a target audience of adolescent boys, it's pretty slim pickings these days. So a ""serious"" film like ""Translation"" isn't exactly faced with a lot of competition.Bottom line: I absolutely despised this film. Hollywood is so in-bred and disconnected these days. I really wonder if the studio honchos have ever considered bringing in some fresh, outside talent.Just because you're the daughter of a major film-maker doesn't mean you have talent. And on the basis of ""Translation"" Coppola should find another line of work (although with her inherited millions, I suppose she doesn't need to work at all, really).",,Anonymous,Comedy
Japan is just a decor. But what a decor!!!,"I watched the film without any influence from anyone. The plot and the actors were absolutely wonderful. I particularly liked the way Japan is described. Personally, I don't think it affects the image of Japanese people at all, it's just a humorous way to illustrate a situation where a man and a woman are getting bored in a world in which nothing is understandable.In fact, if you like action, suspense and special effects, this is NOT your film. However, even if it looks calm and descriptive, this movie is full of feelings and thoughts. I'm glad to realise that Sofia Coppola's third film is just a work of art! I love it and I hope it will get all the rewards it deserves.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One of the best (and weirdest) romcoms I have ever seen,"""Lost in translation"" is a very beautiful and poetic title. It gives the impression that the film is about cultural differences.Partially this is true. The film is situated in Tokio and the two main characters are lost in this big metropole in which they have great difficulties in communicating with the inhabitants. At the same time we see Japan trying to imitate Western culture. They import an American actor (past its peak) to make a commercial for an originally Western product (Whisky) and in the bar of the hotel a Western singer performs the worst version of ""Scarborough Fair"" I have ever heard.The intercultural confusion is the ""comedy"" element of the film, and this is in my opinion not the most important element. The film has also a tragical component. The two main characters are not only lost because they have difficulties communicating with the inhabitants of Tokyo. Also the communication with their partners leaves much to be desired. Bob Harris (the aged actor played by Bill Murray) is alone in Tokyo and the only thought he has by the frequent phonecalls of his wife is how he can end them as soon as possible. Charlotte (played by Scarlett Johansson) is in Tokyo together with her husband. Her husband, who is celebrity photographer, however forgets his wife completely when one of his clients comes in close.With Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson the cast has an established star (Murray) and an upcoming star (Johansson). For Scarlett Johansson ""Lost in translation"" was her breakthrough role as a full grown actress. She is playing very well and is undeniably beautiful. Not a perfect kind of beauty but a natural kind of beauty. Nevertheless ""Lost in translation"" ultimately is the film of Bill Murray. His character can be funny, but most of the time he is too tired to do so.Despite the age difference something beautiful grows between Bob and Charlotte and the film takes on the character of a romcom. It is however one of the most strange (and one of the best) romcoms I have seen, because all the genre conventions are violated. Bob and Charlotte do not have sex, but all the same Bob feels guilty after having a one night stand with the afore mentioned singer at the bar. In stead of having sex Bob slightly touches the foot of Charlotte when they are talking in his hotel room, and (believe it or not) this is far more intimate then it sounds. There is also no happy ending between Bob and Charlotte. In saying goodbye Bob whispers something in the ear of Charlotte. What does he say? That's none of our business!",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Made me fall in love with movies all over again,"Let me be honest; this is my first review and this will not be an objective review. I will not even try.Like so many other reviews here on iMDb, I first saw this movie in the cinema, and I was spellbound. The best way for me to describe my first encounter with Lost in Translation is an 'awakening'. Yes; I fell in love with Scarlet (and Tokyo), yes; I've binge watched everything with Bill Murray in it ever since, but what affected me the most, still to this day, is that I learned that movies does'nt need to be plot driven. Not even to be perfect. And Lost in Translation is, to me, a perfect movie. The music, the acting, the locations, the ambience and the pacing is just pure perfection. So, thank you Sofia Coppola. You made me fall in love with movies all over again.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A personal film,"I have watched God knows how many films in my life, but I believe this is the first time I have actually understood the characters. I felt what they felt at every minute of the film.Bob and Charlotte are surrounded by people who don't speak the same language as they do, and they can't communicate with anyone, until they find each other, not only because they speak the same language but because they are interested and worried about the same things. They share what's on their mind openly and sincerely without any fear. How many times do we find ourselves alone, in a sea of people, of friends and family, and we can't seem to find anyone to talk to, someone who will understand us, and we them.
I think this film captures that loneliness and yearn to find someone who understands us perfectly well, I feel understood, listened to.
It's nice to find someone, even if it's not for so long with whom we can speak the same language.
It's a very personal film and I believe that's why Sofia did so great.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Lost in Transasian,"Wow. Kind of a 'cute' movie, riding on that independent film vibe of the individual's search of meaning in life, struggling mightily against an ignorant and heavily cynical world. Sounds like a downer? Never fear, this movie spends 85 percent of the time making fun of japanese people.If these were scathing attacks, perhaps this movie could almost pass as parody, making fun of stereotypes by overkill is quite effective. Except these were literally, 'let's make fun of the Japanese as bizarre little benign aliens who want to become like us.' This is about two white people trying to have fun in an alien land, shaking their heads at the ridiculous customs of these funny little people, marvelling at how the Japanese could be so different from our own sensible caucasian perspectives. There is no japanese character in this movie who is not grossly caricaturized. Also, whenever Sofia Coppola directed a long lull in the film, hey, insert reocurring joke about height/accents/culture and make the audience laugh, again! There is no such thing as a tired joke in this movie, some jokes are methodically inserted every 15 minutes.Actually, it's really worthwhile to watch Sofia Coppola deftly direct the profoundly subtle relationship between a 21-year-old yale philosophy major and a washed-up 55-year-old actor. Sure...they both...don't like their lives, do like to drink at the bar, eat food (hey at least no more jokes about monkey brains, huh? good thing this wasn't a korean movie), crack jokes about the japanese! The movie should have the tagline, ""How any two white people, no matter how different in age and personality could become soulmates once thrust into this horrible technologically advanced but spiritually backwards world."" Or ""Peter Pan and Wendy in Captain Hook's Oriental Nevernevernightmare."" This movie can be metaphorically summarized by how any two people can fall in love on a deserted island, a deserted island full of poisonous snakes, fetid water, quicksand, and erupting volcanoes.I challenge anybody in the world,including any type of funny little aliens, to logically prove that the particular setting of Japan was necessary to the plot of the movie. Would the relationship between Bill M. and Scarlett J. be any different, if say, it took place in manhattan? Absolutely not, but we wouldn't have the 'comedy' aspect of the movie. And what makes it comedic? Are you laughing at comedy, or are you laughing at the Japanese, these common, stereotypical jokes? I challenge somebody to find any shot in this movie of a japanese person (or perhaps apes in japanese costumes) who isn't acting silly or over the top, as part of a joke, a joke in which the japanese are the being punched by the line.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Ba patient and give it a try,"When I sit to watch it first time, I was pushing myself to watch it to the end: the pace was soooo slow that I thought what a strange and boring movie. The next day I caught myself thinking about it, it just planted in my mind and didn't want to leave. And also it had after-taste: I realized that in fact the movie was inspiring and kind of interesting.
So I immediately watched it again. This time I liked it and noticed and understood moments that did not before. And since then I watched it many times, every year or two.I recommend it if you are true introvert (not because it's a fashion nowadays) , or if you like to be alone, or if you like to think, or if you don't have many friends and actually ok with that, but sometimes you are sad, or if you feel lonely, or if you're trying to find yourself, or is you like to expand your horizons, or if you are looking for your soulmate, or if you don't live by someone's expectations and choose your own way.For me Charlotte is so real girl and so pretty (the looks and inside), and full of harmony. This is the best role of Scarlett. I also liked her in Match point, but this one is better.
Her hobbies in Japan, her tears, her local friends, how she is watching local ceremonies or sits on the windowsill and looks over the city... I would feel the same. I felt so connected to her.
And the music is great.Also, there were some words from Bill's character that shocked me ahead of time: when he said what happens with your life when you've got the first child. This is so true.I don't like to hear that this is ""independent movie not for everybody"". I never liked independent cinematography and never hang out with people who like it, but this one is very good - so I don't care about labels that were put on it.",,Anonymous,Comedy

Two more cents to this mountain,"There obviously has been almost as much as one could possibly say about a single film already posted in the close to 200 pages of reviews, so I will take the liberty of leaving the majority of my opinion out of this one. My opinion will still be included, just not most of it. I could have written these 200 pages myself with how much of an effect this film has had on me.Strangely enough I agree with those that say it is boring just as much as I agree with those who say it is captivating. It really is just a movie about life, which can most definitely include overwhelming situations of both respects. Though my interpretation of these characters was far from describing them as bored.After many hours of pleasant pondering over this movie, my final word on it, and the reason why I enjoyed it so much, is that this movie makes me feel amazing. I'm a hopeless dreamer sort of person, and when I first saw Lost in Translation I shamelessly imagined truly being there. The mere thought of being in that beautiful place, hanging out and singing karaoke with crazy Japanese pot-heads,falling deeply in forbidden love (with Scarlet Johansen no less)! If and when I make my way over to Japan, I can only hope that my trip goes over half this well.What's more is the very tasteful balance of realism. All throughout studying film, every one of my teachers declared that a good film ""makes you forget you are watching a film. And that's what it did for me. I didn't just watch this movie, I felt it. The emotions it evokes are powerful and downright lovely. But hey, everyone's different.On a last note, I would like to clarify for all those who complained about the movie ""poking fun at Japanese people"": the quirky ways of the Japanese have always, to my understanding, been one of main reasons for many people, including myself, why the country is so unique and beautiful. You wouldn't accuse Monty-Python for being mean-spirited for being as ridiculous and British as they were, would you?",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"""Everybody wants to be found""","It's hard translating this film into a review, it really is. The movie doesn't really need one, because the beauty is held within and never needs to be let out. So I'll try my best to translate the feelings the movie provokes from you...The acting was actually some of the best acting I've seen in a film, ever. You actually need to know the voice of subtly and use it, because the film doesn't need a clichéd relationship to carry it onward. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson were wonderful for this role, and something about it just provokes you to feel something you can't exactly put a finger on. I hate seeing bad reviews on here and elsewhere just because people didn't understand the clear message rolling out of it. It almost hurts me to see people finding this a bad movie, but that clearly states they have no heart or soul. The best thing about this film, besides the wonderful use of subtly and the acting, was the ending. The strangest thing is that I didn't want the film to end, kind of like how the characters felt in the movie. It made you CONNECT in a strange way, but you never realize it until the end before they break apart. They executed the ending just how real life would break itself apart, it was actually a perfect ending. I also really loved the setting of Japan. I mean all these movies show relationships in America, while sucking in all these American clichés, but the setting of Japan completes the film. It was such a strange sight to see, but see that was the point. I see Lost in Translation as a character study of two characters that completely randomly set out to find themselves. And it does exactly that. So what else do I say? I really don't know. Wait, isn't that the same feeling the characters in the movie were pressured to?I could go on and on and on about how profound the film really is, but I'm going to make this straight and to the point: see it if you can understand the use of subtly and realize it's not going to be like anything you've seen before. Expect realization of people. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Wonderful story about 2 lost souls,"I thought this movie was great. 2 people lost in a foreign city looking to find them selves again.  The friendship between the 2 characters and the obvious sexual tension really makes for great viewing. Bill Murray was great in this, really showing his ability as an actor. Scarlett Johansson was gorgeous in this film and you got lost in her eyes. Together they really made this film into a fine piece of cinema history.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Strangely Pleasant.,"Lost In Translation (2003) -.This film feels like Peter Venkman from 'Ghostbusters' (1984) got a job on a Whiskey advert in Japan. So while Bill Murray is quite enjoyable to watch and he genuinely is, without my being able to say why, it's also not really a new performance or anything we haven't seen from him before.Giovanni Ribisi and Anna Faris don't bring anything fresh either, but Scarlett Johansson is very good in her role.The story is slow and artsy and if it had been a 30 minute ""Short"" film, I could have seen what the fuss was about, but for me it just ran too long and without actually seeming to go anywhere. It does have a fun ""I'm with them"" kind of vibe to it though. You feel like you would be facing the same struggles if you were in their place too.But in some ways it shows up the Japanese and actually almost seems to take the Mickey out of them racially. Although you do get to see a wide aspect of their culture too.I was under the impression that the Japanese were all taught English when they are young, but the film shows them to just be a people that chat incessantly regardless of misunderstanding that don't bother to try and interact with the American visitors properly. It seemed like that was just a gimmick to make the story harder for Bill and Scarlett's characters, as I'm sure that the Doctors and Hotel Concierge's would know at least a little English.The ending also fell a bit flat too. I think it could probably have had a more definite ending with his return to his family or something else to make it absolutely clear that his life had gone back to normal.It is quirky and doesn't take too much brain power to watch and follow and it has a pleasing feel to it, but it will not be made a permanent part of my collection and will instead be sold on eBay.646.09/1000.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

slow and sleepy but good and colorful 6\10,"The first 10 minutes of the film made me realize from where shawn mendes's song ""Lost in Japan"" was inspired by. if you look back, you'll see the same images and scenes from the song in the movie. when I was asked what this movie is about, I seemply ansered that the film is about an actor in his fifties or sixties who doesn't act anymore and a young lady who doesn't know what she wants to do in the future. eventually the two characters find comfort in each other's company. now I realize that the movie is about loneliness and how people can find comfort with people they like. I also love the idea that the film happnes in Japan where the characters can't comunicate easily with the people in tokyo, so the title of the film makes sense cause of the lost of the characters and how they can't understand anyone. also the colores of the film were really good and gave the film a colorful tone. overall i feel like the movie was fine, not my top choise to watch but fine.

Cinematic masterpiece: So beautiful it hurts,"""Lost in Translation"" is what the art of moving pictures was created for. This is a trip unlike anything you've rarely taken before. Sofia Coppola actually makes you feel more in awe of the very real city of Tokyo than Peter Jackson does with his imaginative Middle Earth! Maybe because she manages to get under our skins, really conveying the very sad feeling of being... lost. But thankfully she sprinkles it with wonderful elements of comedy. Not surprisingly she wrote the screenplay with Bill Murray in mind, and he truly delivers the part of his life. Scarlett Johansson is devastatingly beautiful and together they make one of the oddest and wonderful screen-couples you will ever see. So all-ready from the get-go this movie has a lot of great things going for it.""Lost in Translation"" would however not be what it is if it had not been for the very keen eye of Sofia Coppala. Her observations of the human spirit and everything Tokyo'ish borders on uncanny. The daughter of Francis Ford Coppola actually leaves you with an extreme gratitude to the invention of cinema, just like her father did with his ""Godfather""-movies three decades ago.Probably never before has a tale of two people lost in the big city seemed so fascinating on the big screen. Emphasis on BIG SCREEN because this is the only way to experience ""Lost in Translation"". This is one of those movies that could loose much of it's impact on a TV-set.When the movie was over I had bonded with Murray and Johansson's characters so much I felt really sad having to leave their company.

Beautiful Timeless Indie Film,"A film about isolation, loneliness, romance and unrequited love. Not for everyone due to its quietness, minimalism and sparse narrative.

The movie has a good cast with Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson giving stellar performances with the city of Tokyo epitomising the crisis that both characters are facing. Though they do touch on a romantic sort of bond but more than romantic its a connection of two souls that know that this one week together can perhaps change the course of their lives forever or they weather out the problems that they have for good. I guess it's the ending that brings the rating to 6/10, I guess because it confused me, hopefully I'll get it one day but I still think its a good movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"First time was beautiful but slow, the second time I loved it, third time....","Before I saw this movie a few weeks ago for the first time, and I thought it was a comedy. If you want to see a comedy don't watch this one. This is a very serious movie. It does have some funny moments, and of course Bill Murray is funny as always. The reason I wanted to see this movie was because of the great reviews. And because of Bill Murray (on of my favorite actors) and Scarlett Johansson (I was curious about her). Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is in Tokyo for a commercial and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) is in Tokyo with her husband, who is there for his work. They stay in the same hotel and meet each other a couple of times. They really like each others company, and they both seem not happy in their marriage. When Bob and Charlotte go out they become close friends in a few days. The scene in the end is just one of my favorites of all movies, I just love it. The first time I saw it, the movie was a bit slow, what a lot of people think. But a few days ago I saw the movie again, and I just loved it. The filming was beautiful, the music is just beautiful, the actors are great. And some scenes are just funny, when Murray is on the home-trainer, and his conversation in the waiting room, with the old Japanese man. And of course his 'Suntory Time' commercial. The first time I gave it a 7/10, now and 8/10, after the second time, and I bought the DVD so the third time....maybe a 9/10 or a 10/10. Just watch it, and I you don't know what to think of it, watch it again.And if you can and you enjoyed this movie, watch the making of.

Didn't quite live up to high expectations,"It's often the case that your expectations of a movie can influence your enjoyment of the movie. I generally steer clear of detailed reviews before seeing a movie, but do look at star ratings. It was clear that the critics certainly rated Lost In Translation highly and it was also the type of movie that I really enjoy, so I had very high expectations. I've got to say that I was slightly disappointed with it overall.Bill Murray plays Bob Harris who is a movie star whose best days are behind him.  He's in Tokyo shooting a commercial when he befriends the recently wed Charlotte played by Scarlett Johansson. No other characters play a significant role in the movie. Whilst the acting by the two leads is excellent and the script is very good there isn't really a lot that happens during the movie. The jokes about not being able to understand what the Japanese are saying start to wear thin by the end of the movie. Overall a 7/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I love this film.,"I'm particularly fond of quiet little movies with no special effects or billion-dollar ad campaigns, and this is one of those. The characters drawn by the writers and performers are beautifully crafted. Bill Murray is at his non-clownish best, and Scarlett Johansson is exquisite...and not just for her looks (Yes, I have a slight infatuation with her. What straight man doesn't? I didn't realize until this week that she was only 17 when this movie was filmed (gasp!)).This is a very true tale of two people who are bound together almost by accident: first out of boredom, then out of mutual interest and respect. They have a strong affection for one another, but engage in no sexual activity beyond a couple of kisses. I cannot recommend this film strongly enough, for any viewer mature enough to appreciate it.I was delighted to learn that Sofia Coppola's efforts were rewarded financially.

I cannot understand all the great reviews of this!,"I cannot understand all the great reviews of this film, but then I have seldom agreed with our local newspaper critic.  This time around, most of the critics around the country praised the film and the acting. My best friend loved it while I wanted to walk out, but then I often dance to a different drummer. I have never been a fan of Bill Murray as a comic and this film did not make me a fan of his dramatic talent. I assume there must be some there.  It was boring, slow-moving and whoever told Bill he could sing has an enormous tin ear. Yes, I understand the loneliness of two people in a strange place, but for two hours, it gets to be a bit much!  The romance has left me in my old age, I guess.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
What?,"This film just further proves that I simply do not understand film critics. Lost in Translation is horrible.  What exactly is this thing supposed to be about?  Nothing happens.  The characters do not develop, change, or even engage in anything relatively interesting.  I don't need a movie to enjoy a ""snippet of life"", all I have to do is look around me.  If there's supposed to be a message in this movie, it's either way beyond my comprehension, or it's simply ""people that are unhappy and alone sometimes find others to share their misery with"".  I'd like to find someone to share my misery after watching this debacle of a film.  Sure, the scenery is sometimes pretty, but that's Japan's fault, not Coppola's.  It manages to be effective in spite of her, not because of her.  1 star out of 5.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
My favourite film,"The story - so simple yet beautiful and not boring. The characters - depressed but not depressing. The music - so beautiful and fitted perfectly. The pictures - contrasts between posh and modern vs. Traditional Japan.Bill Murray plays perfectly in this film and so does Scarlett Johansson - their age difference is obvious and yet it does not matter because their love and friendship are pure and honest.After so many years of re-watching this film I'm still amazed and still can't decide - is it sad or is it hopefull? It's delicate, funny and sad, fresh, non-obvious, all at the same time. Definitely my favourite film.",,Anonymous,Comedy
In Short - A Beautiful Film!,"Lost In Translation is the kind of film which after viewing it leaves audience members with a sweet taste in their mouths like they have just had something absolutely delicious to eat. This anyhow is my feelings towards the film, which I'm shocked in this case to find that not everyone agrees with. My taste in movies is quite diverse and I will sometimes adore movies when i haven't read a single good review, or absolutely detest films which have been consistently praised! In the case of Lost in Translation, quite a few of my friends have classed it as 'boring', or 'too simple'. Usually I'll take this criticism in my stride, accepting that everyone has their different opinions but in this particular film I couldn't help but argue against what my friends were saying - After all how could they call such a beautifully made film as this, boring? How can such a comment possibly be justified?...Naturally I asked them to explain.'Yes...Yes Johnny the film does boast some great acting, I'll agree with you there and yes certainly Coppola has shown plenty of skill both behind the camera and in her writing of the script - I found the truthfulness of the language spoken between the two key characters to be wonderfully startling.' This is a relatively vague remembrance of what one of my good friends said to me upon their viewing of the film. Naturally I asked why, when they had nothing but compliments to add, did they not like it and this was the response I got, 'It's just not for me Johnny - It moves along at too slow a pace and I just wasn't satisfied enough by the premise to be willing enough to be taken along for the ride.' My friend spoke this in such an articulate manner that I was left to marvel at his clarity - he understood perfectly why he didn't like the film and it was at this moment when I realized that I just couldn't argue anymore - I had nothing more to say.I understand that readers may by now be getting frustrated at why I'm not really 'reviewing' this film. Personally I believe Lost In Translation is a near masterpiece -It boasts strong performances, great dialogue, a touching yet realistic story and excellent direction. Despite my recommendation though to go and see the film, I should very much like to emphasize that it's not for everyone - there will be some people who will be bored out of their minds and while I certainly didn't feel that way in watching it, I understand perfectly well how there will be those who will be frustrated at its simplicity.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Lost in Translation,"I really enjoyed lost in Translation and found it really easy watching, I was also surprised to find a film that seemed to live in real time and had a steady and realistic plot.However after watching it I began to wonder whether a male director could have produced this film with the same results and whether the fact that I found it so different and refreshing was because it was directed from a female point of view.As I don't know anyone else who has watched the film I would be really interested to see what other people think and whether I am putting too much emphasis on the director or whether I should be embracing the differences between male and female directors?",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A fantastic film about improbable encounters,"Some films are really hard to put you finger on. You sit in the theater, you're taken along a ride, you laugh, you cry, you smile all the way through the end, and a couple of hours later (who counts, they just flied by) you're left with a big ""WOW"" sensation and something to think and dream about.Very few films does this to you, but I'm so pleased to recommend this one to anyone who enjoys the sensation. It delivers!My company at the theater almost fell asleep, and afterwards complained that it might have been the ""most boring film she's ever seen"". So I guess it isn't for everyone. Really - nothing happens. There's no plot, no thrills, no expectations.. Yet it's a warm and captivating film about people who shouldn't have met, in situations that shouldn't be. Very romantic, very funny, very warm.If you love movies, appreciate style, good camera work, awesome acting and probably are ane adult? If you have some life experience and could squeeze in some spare time; do your self a favour and watch it. It's just *that* good!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
lost the plot,"This film came highly praised which always raises ones expectations so by the end I was disappointed. It does have one of Bill Murray's finest performances, it does have one or two hilarious scenes,  and it's presentation of Tokyo is dazzling and enticing. But there was an uneasyness about the film, the way it gets most of it's laughs at the expense of japanese language and culture and the rather big age difference between the two leads (not helped by Murray looking a lot older than his 53 years). You knew the relationship was always going nowhere and when the laughs dry up the film slowly draws to it's obvious conclusion. There are some great lines mostly between Murray and his wife and the soundtrack by kevin Shields is the coolest thing about the film, which is by no means bad, but in the end you wished for more of a story rather than this dreamy vague impression of one.

Still All Magickal,"Just paying my tribute here - re-watched Lost in Translation a few days ago and the magic is still there. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson shine bright in this one. I understand that some people are bored by the movie, but well, not every tune rings a bell in everybody.

"Overrated, But Still A Good Movie.","I totally understand the appeal this movie gets. What I don't get is people calling this one of the year's best and one of the best ever. In no way does this movie push the envelope for what cinema can do and in no way does this elicit extremely strong effects on the viewer. The effects on the viewer are normal, but nothing huge.Francis Ford Coppola's daughter, Sofia, already made a name for herself as a director with the highly impressive ""The Virgin Suicides"" in 1999. Four years later, she makes her most decorated film-a movie that isn't really about anything, other than exploring loneliness.Bill Murray shines in arguably his best performance (this is his most serious) as famous actor, Bob Harris. Tired and bored, Bob spends a few weeks in Tokyo doing a commercial. We get to know Bob pretty well.Bob soon meets young Charlotte, played by Scarlett Johansson. A recent college grad, she is in Tokyo with her husband (Giovanni Ribisi) who is a photographer for a band touring the area. He is always with his clients, leaving her lonely too.Bob and Charlotte's relationship is completely platonic. A blossoming romance would have been too awkward since they are really far apart in age. But a normal friendship is a good change of pace between a man and a woman.Bob and Charlotte doing various activities together that are mildly interesting. Alone, what they do is also mildly interesting. (There is a scene with Bob and some Japanese woman pretending to be raped by him that is one of the most random scenes in film history).One thing that this movie really has going for it is the lovely Tokyo setting. It is almost as if Coppola tries to make this avant-garde, making the setting a character that reflects Bob and Charlotte. If that's what she tried to do, she didn't do that good of a job. The bright lights are nice to look at, but that's it.While we get to know Bob and Charlotte well, the movie goes nowhere. It is just a series of random events that make these two lost souls feel less lonely. That actually sounds nice, but the way Coppola conveys it is decent but not amazing.Truth is, there is nothing amazing about this. The two leads are impressive, the look is nice, and that's it. Everything else is much too mild to spew over.3/4",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Why the Hype?! Focus needs to get into it.,"Sofia Coppola's film is nothing short of bland. It's only saving graces are its perspective of Americans viewing Japanese culture and Ana Faris's acting, albeit her character was nerve-racking.The exposition of setting up each main character worked well, but bringing the two together was executed in far too convenient a manner, nor was the chemistry quite right.As with movies such as ""A Thin Red Line,"" only one scene came across as viable and intellectually stimulating - the scene discussing life, marriage, and future.BAFTA awarding Murray and Johansson, and the Academy nominating the former, just seems purely inane, for neither actor's role carried much challenge or deep performance. As Patrick Stewart says on a TNT commercial, ""Drama is life heightened."" I found no such drama in this film.Focus Features claims to make original pictures, in opposition to the endless cliche movies of Hollywood; however, the three I've seen so far have had unoriginal plots, bland stories, and sparsely challenging roles. Before viewing ""Lost in Translation,"" I had seen ""Gosford Park"" and ""Swimming Pool."" Ludivine Sagnier was the only worthwhile aspect of the latter, and the plot of the former was not ""original,"" as the Academy had awarded it - ""Memento"" was far more ""original"" a screenplay. I just hope that the ultra original premise of ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is not diluted by Focus's inept execution of film.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Masterpiece of Intimacy,"""Lost in Translation"" is unique. It makes me sad to hear people say it's overrated and boring because ""nothing happens"". True, if you want to see car chases and teenage massacres, you better look for the next ""The Fast and the Furious"" or ""Hostel"", since lots of good stuff happen there. Otherwise, you should give LiT a try.This is a movie that you feel, relate to. Bob Harris (Bill Murray), a 50-something year-old movie star, and the young, Yale-graduate Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), meet in a Tokyo hotel and develop an unusual bond. It can be seen as a friendship or a romance, depending on your point of view. They feel disconnected with their respective spouses. They don't speak Japanese and everything sounds weird in that city of blinding lights. But the language barrier is the least of their problems. Human relationships are the hardest to translate, and Bob and Charlotte will realize they have a lot in common and decide to enjoy their time together. Sofia Coppola's wonderful, sensitive screenplay, the gorgeous soundtrack and the beautiful cinematography (by Lance Acord) take us into their world, and we have an unforgettable night in Tokyo - the peak being a relaxing karaoke.I've loved ""Lost in Translation"" since the first time I saw it, by the end of 2004, and when I moved to the US last year (I'm Brazilian and lived in my hometown for 18 years), I could relate to it even more. You don't have to move from your homeland or have to learn a second language to feel lost in translation, though - actually, it's something that you'll probably feel at least for a short while in your life, if you're lucky. If not, you may live your whole life totally lost without even knowing and not enjoying it to the fullest.Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson (it's amazing to see she was only 17 going on 18 when it was filmed) deliver magnificent performances and have one of the greatest on-screen chemistries I've ever seen; Giovanni Ribisi (as Charlotte's husband) and Anna Faris as a dumb blonde actress (the scene in which she sings ""Nobody Does It Better"" is hilarious) give great support. Sofia Coppola crafted this timeless masterpiece of intimacy that'll make anyone who ever felt dull and alone in this world, satisfied. And wishing for more.""You're not hopeless"". 10/10.",,Anonymous,Comedy
"A lovely story, wonderful actor and a genius directing: A Classic!","Did I like ""Lost in Translation""? I absolutely love it! Sofia Coppola reveals herself as a superbly talented writer, an intelligent and skillful director, and a real connoisseur of human nature. She depicts every adult's concerns, hopes and fears in an admirable way, that I would not have expected from someone that young. And the story is full of unforeseeable twists, challenges to stereotypes. You go from some very clever and funny lines, to others that dig deep inside the heart. Though Ms Coppola is not really ""new"" in this business, her career really promises to delight us much further. I am sure that we'll see her creativity and passion evolve into new stories I can hardly wait to see. Bill Murray's performance as Bob Harris was incredible. He amazingly conveys all his feelings (loneliness, regret, urge for someone beyond one's reach, remorse, ephemeral joy, sense of having wasted some of own life) to spectators, and far before the movie has ended everybody in the theater loves the guy. He truly deserved the Oscar (and not because Mr Penn didn't!). Scarlett Johansson is also outstanding in giving life to Charlotte, because that's what she did: she made Charlotte alive, a real person. It would have been really easy to leave the female role in the background with such an amazing male performer besides her, but Ms Johansson admirably overcame the challenge. In summary, this is a surprising, beautiful and touching movie, an authentic classic, and I recommend it with two thumbs up!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Good Film,"The main reason I am writing this review is to find out if anyone knows what type of car Bill Murray is driven around in during the film. It is a black luxury sedan. Thx in advance for anyone who can offer help. In other news, I greatly enjoyed this film. To put it into words, it was kinda like a quiet night spent with friends. Besides that Scarlette Johanson is so beautiful they could just film her walking around anywhere doing anything and I'd watch it. If you haven't seen this film, I do recommend it. Have a good day!!! I don't have enough lines of text so I guess I will tell you more about this film. I personally have never been to Tokyo or Japan in general, but it definitely looks like somewhere that would be very cool to see and experience, of course this comes with a stipulation of having the funds to stay in awesome hotels, like the one featured in the film.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Interesting?,"Bill Murray is Bob, a movie star who is in Tokyo to shoot a whiskey commercial. Scarlett Johansson is Charlotte, she is a young wife who is tagging along with her workaholic husband. When they both become lost in a city where they feel alienated by the culture and the language, they both suffer with insomnia and are left dealing with their loneliness. When they cross paths in a luxury hotel bar they strike up an intimate friendship, and begin to explore the great city together.Murray and Johansson both deliver stunning and insightful performances, and their is some subtle humour along their journey through Tokyo. Sadly, however good each element in this film is, the result is somewhat boring at times, OK the film is about human connection and loneliness, and the character depth is great (even without much development) but this alone does not make a interesting movie. I couldn't help feeling the movie had little real point, it has all the ingredients of a masterpiece, except one - the story.6/10 for trying",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Just the perfect way to guide you through some emotions,"I did have this film in my watchlist for a long time. It was recommended to me by my cousin and I finally watched it when I am approaching the same age that he had when he said it to me.It is amazing how we sometimes watch some films at the exact moment we feel we need to. That is the main reason I love this art the way I do. For those of us that have a predisposition towards it, this may help us to get over the hump and that is exactly the way I feel regarding this movie. It does not force itself onto us the way others try to. This film is an experience that does not intend to please us and you can tell it just from the start. Its slow paced scenes could make us wonder in which direction everything is developing but i quickly felt that it was clearly playing with me. That is the main reason I give this experience a perfect score. There are few films out there that have the power to toy with us in this manner. It does it effortlessly and it nurtures us through a ride full of laughs, joyful moments and sad ones of course. I could sympathise at every moment with both Bob and Charlotte, both male and female lead characters something that is very rare for me. We usually tend to feel for one of them in a stronger way than for the other but this is one of this film superpowers. The ability to transfer every feeling these characters go through of course due to the amazing performances by Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson. They left me in awe from start to finish.I would like to point out that it has one of the most satisfying endings I have seen. It may be shrouded in mystery but it was filled with hope and warmth to my eyes. It has become one of my all time favourites.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Sweet and brimming with atmosphere,"True to its title, Lost in Translation forgoes writing and dialogue in favor of richly textured photography, carefully selected music, and subtly implied significance.It works, up to a point. There's only so much you can convey by implication, and this may leave the movie feeling either pretentious or shallow.That said, there is an undeniable sensitivity to the production. The camera gorges itself on swirls of grainy color, while delicate and precise editing keeps it from being self-absorbed. The musical choices give off all the right cues and frequently carry entire shots.All in all a beautifully executed mood piece, if timid in its exploration of the underlying themes.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Most boring movie EVER!,"What's there to say? This is a movie in which nothing happens. And it happens to a bunch of utterly uninteresting nobodies. Bill Murray is supposedly engaged in ""understated"" acting. Mostly he looks like a man either bored to death, or in one weeklong Valium trance. His counterpart, Scarlet Johansson, is lost in some sort of existential fog. Maybe these are the kind of people who relate to this movie, and thus find some sort of deep, meaningful message in it. I don't.The whole premise is these two are in Japan for a week, he to shoot ads for a local liquor company, she to basically do nothing while her husband, a famous photographer, also shoots ads. They're both stuck in the same plush hotel, so they hook up. Sort of. Mostly, to the extent they do anything at all, they commiserate. She's unhappy with her marriage. He can't even muster up that much energy. He drinks a lot (making him, at least, a good pitchman for his product). Together they, um, well, do stuff. I guess. About the only thing memorable was where they hung out with some Japanese party animals, one of whom does a (bad) Karaoke rendition of a Sex Pistols song. Oh, the hell with it, merely trying to describe what this movie is about is such a dull process it's putting ME to sleep. Better simply to describe what's wrong with it, which is to say, just about everything.First off, Bill Murray doesn't even remotely resemble what he's supposed to be, a washed up action movie star reduced to doing commercials in Japan. Instead, he comes across as some middle class nobody, a salesman perhaps, forced to spend a week abroad on business. Which brings up another complaint. This film comes off as if these two actually live in Japan, and are finding it difficult to adjust. Which would have made far more sense, but a week? Anyone can put up with being in a foreign country for a week! But most important, there's absolutely no dramatic tension at all. The closest they come to doing anything scandalous is when they share a couple tepid kisses at the very end. And she, wandering around in her philosophical haze, could have come up with something more dramatic than visiting a Buddhist temple a couple times. How about a suicide attempt? A big fight with her husband when he's sucking up to the hot, blonde starlet (who I mistook for Cameron Diaz, turns out she's played by Anna Faris, of ""Scary Movie"" fame)? Something, anything!Oh well. This movie plays like ""American Beauty"", if you took that film and sucked it dry of everything funny, weird or erotic. That film, while somewhat pretentious, was at least interesting. In contrast, one gets the sense that this film wants to be pretentious too, but it simply lacks the energy.1/10",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A short film pushed to be a feature.,"This comes across like a short film idea that has been pushed to be featurelength and was done because of the heavy connections of the director. Yes, Bill Murray is in it, so people are searching for meaning when nothing exists. If you like watching long pauses of two people hanging out in a hotel together with no real conversation, this movie is for you. If you were to watch this movie, I suggest you keep your finger on the fast-forward button. To the person who said theywatched this movie 10 times, you are looking far to hard for something that isn't there. The movie description of the characters is far more interesting thanwatching the movie. Without the heavy family connections, this movie wouldhave never been more than a 5 minute short film shoot on digitial video.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Wonderful,"I guess this is just one of my all time favorite films. After watching it for about the tenth or whatever time, I'm compelled to write a rare review, cos it feels good. It's sweet, soulful, poetic, and brings out a lot of good year tearful feelings. Two lost people, in a strange land of vastly different culture find each other for a week. The filming is both an appreciation of Japanese culture and also a satire (I can see why some would be offended). Bill Murray was so excellent with his subtle hilarity, and Scarlett was discovered in her modest and excellent breakout performance. I could go on and on. All of the positive reviews have already covered the beauty of this movie. The negative reviews? I don't know...maybe folks were expecting something else.

Like Real Slumming in Japan,"14 October 2003 (revised January 25, 2019). This movie reminds me of Bridges of Madison County. While the setting is Japan in this movie, the relationship seems similar. What the audience is exposed to is a slice of informal life of the real Japan and this movie comes across more of a documentary without narrative about two people who find themselves in Japan. Without much of a script in appearance, this slow moving, more evocative feeling sensual movie is more about sensations than about drama or storyline. The movie becomes more of an experience and instead evokes the more inscrutable depths of a drama. The mesmerizing backdrop of Japan and the realistic sensation of actually living an ordinary life of two people's experiences and friendship are compelling.

Admittedly you won't like this film...,"Unless you know what it's like to be in another country, feeling separate, detached... lonely.

That someone could imagine the sounds, characters, visuals and connections that so perfectly express what those abroad feel and are drawn to is what's so impressive.So it is a targeted film and one that will not ever be on the IMDB top 150. Because there is only a few that will relate and the rest will look confusingly on in the same way they will to their friends and family that choose to live or stay in another country as something other than a vacation.

"Nomination should have been ""best-connected new director""","I doubt anyone would have seen this had Sofia's last name not been ""Coppola"". (And that would have been unfortunate--don't get me wrong.) The film is well done and worth a look, but it's very much in the category of ""rent, don't buy"".I've never been to Tokyo, and I might think differently about it if I had. (For example, my Dad really enjoyed ""The Sound of Music"" (he's not a big fan of musicals) because it showed so much of Austria, where he had lived for several years.) Very early in the movie it was clear that the film was as much about ""here is what the experience of being in Tokyo is like"" as it was about anything else. That's a perfectly valid thing for a film to be about, but if something gets nominated for best picture, you might expect a little more.Now, granted, the relationship that forms is interesting--it's not like the story is pathetic and Tokyo is the only thing the movie has going for it. But...Best Director? Best Actor? Best Picture? That's just way, way overdoing it.If you want to enjoy it, go into it with this in mind: ""I want to see what being in Tokyo is like."" If that's your only expectation, you'll like the film. If you go in wanting to see why it got the nominations it did, you'll still be wondering at the end.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Lost In Translation is a beautiful work of art.,"I believe that movies are meant to be works of art. It seems to me like these days, movie makers are more concerned about making money than producing a quality piece of work. Not that there's anything wrong with going to a movie and just wanting to have a good time, but sooner or later you're going to want to see something with substance, something with meaning. Thankfully, Lost In Translation is a movie with both substance and meaning to spare. To put it simply, Lost In Translation is a beautiful work of art.Directed by Sofia Coppola, and brilliantly acted by both Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson, Lost In Translation is a movie that is equal parts depth, and subtlety. Bill Murray is allowed to display his true talent in this movie, and plays his role so smoothly, it makes you wonder why he hasn't been cast in more movies like this. Both Murray and Johansson play characters that have a sadness about them, but there is an intensity to their performances that leaves you in awe. The talent of the people working on this movie is truly amazing. This movie is a jewel, and it shines brilliantly thanks to a great story, a great director, and great actors.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"There's nothing really remarkable about the flick, but there's nothing bad about it either.","There's not all that much that can be said about 'Lost In Translation (2003)', a film in which the plot is secondary to the characters and yet even they aren't really all that well developed. The result is a feature that meanders around without ever kicking into gear and ultimately feels almost entirely improvised in a way which seems more due to a lack of proper planning than a spontaneous on-set spark. The focus is placed solely on the relationship that forms between the two protagonists but, while this is certainly a believable and relatively compelling connection, it never felt enough to carry the weight of an entire movie especially since it is painted as platonic for most of the run-time until suddenly the pair - who are separated by a large age gap and are both already married to different people - silently decide it is more than that. There's nothing bad about the flick, though. The almost dream like direction and spur-of-the-moment feel combine with the understated performances to make a film that feels subtly realistic. It's just that there's nothing particularity gripping about it, either. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"So much footage, so little film","A disaffected American actor making a whisky commercial in Tokyo teams up with a young American guest in his luxury hotel. As the trailer shows this isn't a bad premise for a film but unfortunately the writer/director has NO idea how to structure a narrative or pace a film. There's not one arresting scene, memorable line of dialogue or three-dimensional character in the whole thing. I may be exaggerating but if you took out all the scenes where someone stared moodily out of the window the thing would probably only last 25 minutes. You will take away from this film the amazing knowledge that people in foreign countries a)do things a little differently and b) often don't speak English. Why either a veteran movie star or a Yale philosophy graduate would be fazed by this I don't know but those remaining 25 minutes would pretty much consist of their slack-jawed astonishment at the antics of those crazy Japanese (who--hold the front page--sing karaoke and can't tell their ""Rs"" from their ""Ls""). The most overrated film since ""American Beauty"". My wife had to laugh when she saw there was ""bonus material"" on the DVD. ""Bonus to what? There's no movie on there!""",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Miserable,"Hype hype hype. That's all there is to Lost In Translation. There's literally nothing else of value to this film. Sophia Coppola's direction, Bill Murray's performance, the very ""plot"" of this movie... everything you've heard is pure hype, and if anybody tells you otherwise, they're lying through their teeth. This is, without question, the most boring, lifeless snoozefest I've ever had the displeasure of viewing. I could swear it was 3 hours long.I simply cannot force myself to believe that anyone truly loves this movie. It's just... so... dull. Even the ""interesting"" parts that supposedly show how exciting and lively the Tokyo underworld is... they're unbelievably boring and irritating. Tokyo is completely wasted as a setting. This whole segment of the movie was like watching a series of terrible home videos featuring people you've never met, speaking a language you don't know so that when something interesting happens, you aren't even aware of it.And what about the two main characters? All I can say is... who cares??? Both of them are completely colorless, and Bill Murray's ""brilliant"" performance is something most actors could do in their sleep. Neither character gave me any reason to like them, care about them, hate them, sympathize with them, or even bother to watch them.The fact that this was actually nominated for Academy Awards makes me lose all hope for the future of humanity. I can't believe how overrated this movie is. It just blows my mind. I was expecting so much, and I got absolutely nothing except an hour and a half older.The worst part is that someone decided to categorize this movie as a comedy.You have got to be kidding me. Because Bill Murray wears an ugly shirt at some point? Because Japanese people have a strange culture? Murray's character isn't funny, strange Japanese mannerisms get old fast, and don't even TRY to feed me that ""subtlety"" line... this movie is not a comedy, is not funny, and is completely undeserving of all the praise it has received.I had nothing but good expectations for this movie, so it's not like I wanted to hate it and did. The fact is that this film is utterly pointless, ridiculously tedious, and just plain lacks any sort of substance. It's just plain awful. Don't see it. Don't even give it a chance. Don't let the IMDb star rating fool you, and don't give in to critics' sterling reviews. All these people are out of their minds, or they're just gluttons for punishment. This is just one of those movies that people give good ratings because the star is getting old and their time for an Oscar is running out, because they're idiots, or because they like watching something that is as exciting as being in a coma.So there you go.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Ms. Coppola is very talented.,"Not a Bill Murray fan, here, although I've been warming to him since ""Groundhog Day."" At any rate, he gives a very nuanced performance, which is saying a lot for this acerbic comic actor. When I viewed this movie I had no idea that people hate it. I only just got that from reading this page. I found it refreshingly nonlinear. This is one viewer who is tired to death of trite formulas in Hollywood film-making, and this film sidesteps trite by a mile. I'm not a film expert by any means, just a thoughtful person who views with curiosity and an open mind. So take my recommendation at its face value, nothing more. I really enjoyed this film and would recommend it to anyone who's attention span hasn't been ruined by contemporary television.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Like a dream,"This is a beautiful and moody film featuring excellent performances and a wonderful soundtrack. I really love it because it is so simple; it has only a little dialog, yet it manages to leave an unforgettable impact on the viewer; it is so beautifully photographed, it leaves you hoping you were a filmmaker and came up with all these wonderful scenes and images yourself; it is so clever in setting its story in Tokyo, you really live with the characters as they navigate in those almost alien surroundings.All in all, in my opinion this is a near-perfect film. It is mainstream film-making at it's farthest form, really becoming art. Yet it features two big movie stars, both contributing the best of their generation in the film. The chemistry between Murray and Johansson is palpable; it is wonderful how the viewer 'gets' this through the silent scenes. It is the artistry of director Sofia Coppola that combines all these elements so effortlessly and easily. It all feels so true, so natural.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Beautifully Translated,"I have seen this movie several times and it gets better with each viewing. Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray are spectacular, along with Sofia Coppola's direction.This movie could have fallen within two clichés; typical chick flick or typical unlikely friend duo. You do have both, but Sofia Coppola blended them both so well. Both characters give off such great energy and depth they keep you entranced. The city of Tokyo is also an important character in the movie. The city has so much personality and character. The musical scores add some mystery and unknown to the film.Lost in Translation is inspiring and intelligent, and, lets not forget, entertaining.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Beautifully unique,"It's the story of a man. A famous actor, middle-aged, not particularly happy in his marriage. And it's the story of a woman. Much younger, a recent college graduate, also not particularly happy in her marriage. These two Americans meet by chance in a Tokyo hotel. In most movies this is where a cheap, meaningless fling would ensue. But Sofia Coppola's script is much too smart for that. And so Lost in Translation is something entirely different. Something unexpected, a beautiful surprise. It's the story of two lonely people, two lost souls. And in finding one another perhaps they can find themselves.In playing this couple brought together by fate Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson are superb. Murray plays Bob Harris, a hugely successful actor who is in Japan to make commercials for whiskey. He hates himself for it, he'd rather be home doing theater. But the money's good. And home's not all it's cracked up to be anyway. His marriage has grown stale. Bob's a guy in the throes of a midlife crisis. And Murray captures the character perfectly. The sense of loneliness, the sense of disappointment in life and in himself, it's all etched on Murray's face. So famous for loud and outrageous comedy here Murray does so much with simple subtlety. Meanwhile Johansson plays Charlotte, a young woman tagging along with her celebrity photographer husband on his trip to Japan. Even when her husband is around Charlotte feels lost and alone. When he's off working and she's left to fend for herself all the pain and doubt she is feeling threatens to consume her. She needs something to cling to and that something turns out to be Bob Harris. And as this couple embarks on an undeniably interesting and rather unusual relationship the young Johansson proves to be up to the task of matching the veteran actor Murray. The two stars turn in hugely memorable performances which really elevate the film.But as wonderful as Murray and Johansson are perhaps the true star of the film is Sofia Coppola. She wrote a wonderful script. And then she directed it so beautifully. She has a truly terrific visual sense, making the city of Tokyo almost a character unto itself with the way she captures it on camera. As Bob and Charlotte explore the city everything is framed so beautifully. And when the movie briefly veers away from all the excitement of the big city for a few moments in a much quieter, peaceful locale Coppola succeeds in making that perhaps the film's most beautiful scene of all. She has made a movie which definitely succeeds in drawing you in and making you care about its characters. It's not the most exciting thing you've ever seen. It's much more subtle than that, a movie which trusts itself enough to unfold at its own leisurely pace. And in this case that works. It's a great story of two people who initially are lost but end up finding something. What they find may not be exactly what they were looking for but this is a movie too smart for the simple answer, the easy way out. And that more than anything else is what makes this movie a success.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Overrated,"I didn't expect much and I wasn't surprised by what I saw in this vastly overrated film. The story is sweet enough and human enough to win anyone's attention. Meandering through the script like a half-baked zombie in a morgue which was probably his intention, Bill Murray does a fine job in underacting and evoking his alienated movie-star tourist persona. Scarlett Johansson also shares Murray's alienation but channels it in a subtler manner. The best aspect of the film is its visual beauty. The lensing is similar to Christopher Doyle's atmospheric work in Chungking Express, but here the austerity and anoynymous spaces that the characters inhabit match the abstract sense of detached reality Coppola evokes so effectively.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

extremely boring,"I was watching this movie and it came to a point where it had dragged on so long that I was anxious for it to be over, so I checked the time and only fifteen minutes had passed since the beginning of the movie. I spent money to rent it so I kept watching it for another 45 minutes...still no plot after an hour. I would say what the movie is about, but I don't know that it's really about anything. It's a conglomeration of pointless scenes that don't make up a story. I was expecting a great film considering it's 8.0 ranking here at imdb, but for the life of me, I can't figure out how one person would think this movie is in any way good, let alone fifteen thousand. This one has apparently done well at the film festivals, so that should be enough of a sign to steer clear of it. Indie movies are indie for a reason...they suck. This is a great one to rent if you struggle with insomnia.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Mis-sold as a hilarious comedy where really it is a poignant character piece,"Bob Harris is an American movie star at the end of his career who travels to Japan to do whiskey commercials.  Charlotte is the young wife of a hot new photographer who finds herself stuck in the hotel room as her husband works. Both of them struggle with the different culture and language barrier, however they slowly get to know one another and find friendship in each other.The one flaw I found in this film was that it was totally mis-sold as a hilarious comedy.  On one hand this was to it's benefit as the film performed well in the cinema with the multiplex crowds, but on the downside would be that much of the audience expected to be laughing all the way - even to the point that some forced laughs at bits that were only amusing (I hate that!).  I had my doubts as the Coppola's are not well known for their joke writing and I was pleased to be found right but to find that the lack of the promised `hilarity' was replaced by a bittersweet tale of two people.The film is pretty slow and requires patience at times, but for the most part it is paced very well and is driven by the two characters.  The way the two find a sort of understanding between themselves is slowly moving and goes way beyond the rather clumsy jokes about how Japanese people pronounce words differently from us!  Both characters go on a journey - it is hard to describe as it is better experienced than described.  It is touchingly sweet and manages to be both low-key and intense at the same time.Director Coppola does an excellent job, even if her style is more suited to art house than multiplex.  The movement of the camera is very natural and nearly every shot was imaginative in some way - whether it be the camera movement or the close up framing of the characters.  She managed to give the film an unique visual style that I found very appealing despite the fact that I suspect it may not come through totally on video.  Coppola is blessed by Bill Murray in two ways.  Firstly, his presence alone means the film has clout and can be easily marketed as a `hilarious comedy' for the Saturday night lot.  Secondly, and more importantly, he is very, very good.  I wasn't won over at the start as he sort of controls the dry humour, but later, as his character grows, he shows a real ability.  I forgot he was an actor, I forgot he was a character, he just seemed to speak so naturally and from the heart that it was hard to believe he was only delivering scripted lines. I suspect the Academy will only honour him with a nomination but not buck the trend, but I believe his was one of the best performances I have seen in this award year.Johansson is equally as strong and does a surprising amount of acting with her eyes and mouth.  I loved her character and again, it was easy to forget that this was not a real person but an actress delivering lines.  Ribisi is always interesting but has little to do.  The support cast delivers the laughs but I must admit that it was almost a relief to meet Charlie et al - Japanese characters who weren't just used for laughs even if they weren't developed to go anywhere.If you buy the marketing and expect the onslaught of hilarity and belly laughs that the trailer suggests then you will likely leave the cinema wondering what the fuss was all about.  However if you go in with an open mind it is very hard not to be consistently amused as you get to know the characters and bond with them at the same time as the characters do with one another.  The end result is more art house than multiplex but it is all the best for it.  Warm, humorous, touching and very well filmed, Lost in Translation stands out of one of the best films of the year - and it's only January.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Two people who are lost in translating their thoughts,"It seems that Hollywood wants movies to be big and extensive, complex and in a way exhausting. The big movies are rewarded and paid attention to, they are shown in cinemas around the globe and become famous beyond belief. And in this stream of long, elaborate movies only some quiet and unobtrusive, somehow reserved films succeed in entering public attention and approval: Sofia Coppola's masterpiece ""Lost in Translation"" is one of those seemingly small productions that are nearly as much rewarded as they deserve to be. But this picture, having a clever and soft plot, a story that makes you expect the worst, is very big - concerning its contents and the beauty of Coppola's very personal language. We are plainly shown how two Americans that are on the surface totally different from each other - which is summed up in the difference of age that obviously is unmasked as fully unimportant in the course of the movie - get to know each other in a strangely speechless Japanese city. Technically this is reflected by a sound-mixing that seems to stress that all the Americans perceive is either quiet and hard to hear at all or loud and indistinct. The two Americans do not experience any real speaking, conversation, communication with the Japanese. And as the title already hints at it, this superficial problem of not being able to communicate properly in a culture that is entirely strange to them is the topic of the movie. But the state of being lost that seems more vital to the meaning of the picture is the incapability of the protagonists - a young newly-married woman who wants to be a philosopher, staying in Japan because her weird husband, a photographer, has to work there, and a comparatively elderly former movie star who produces commercials in Japan - to speak things out, to say what should be said, to change what obviously needs to be changed. Only in the end does this problem suddenly seem to change, for Bob obviously says something wonderful and significant, but inaudible in Charlotte's ear - though this is not sure and just one possible interpretation of the open ending. It is a sociological, psychological and very personal view that we are given at the same time. An unequal couple that develops something that is - up to a certain point when there should be some words - beyond sex or words, relationship or marriage. It is an adventure in this place where everybody is somehow lost and alone, a joyride through the possibilities of the night in this anonymous city. They come closer and closer without clearing their relation, without any need of it. And when they are lying in bed - a decent and typical distance of a foot or so between them - Bob simply touches her injured foot, saying nothing. And this is the magic of the story: The protagonists do those little things that can change a life, those trivial and small movements, faces and gestures. And Sofia Coppola emphasizes them very indirectly, subtly by showing us pictures without words, sequences in which the distracting sound of the people is faded out and all that is left is this wonderfully emotional rock music. She seems to know what it is like to be part of a flush of feelings and activities, to lose oneself in wild adventures with people, music and looking at each other. And so she takes her time to let those two Americans come closer, making the viewer fully understand why a relation like that is possible, why it is so much better than being married to the young and agile photographer, or being rich and famous. She knows her thing and spends a whole film on a development that other directors would have spent minutes on - to finally deal with something more captivating than just human interaction. And this is what makes this film an unbelievably splendid piece of art: It stresses a thing that is so normal, so average and mediocre: falling in love with the wrong person, not being able to maintain something you truly need, losing yourself in a place and a person for a short and unforgettable time of your life. And it tells a story that is unlikely and interesting, exciting and entertaining: a mature man and a girl being so close and falling so passionately and quietly for each other. It is a lovely, patient, authentic and fantastic film that teaches us what the best and most thrilling moments of your life can be and how fast they are over - but something always remains: the memory of having lived in those very moments that form you more than years can do.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Genuine and Touching,"One of the rare movies which deals with the emotions of people in normal life circumstances.There is no rigid storyline so as to speak,but it is about two Americans having post marital problems meeting up in a hotel in Tokyo.There are some hilarious scenes in the initial parts of the movie. The movie is very natural in the way that emotional and romantic tension between the two characters is palpable..Bill Murray etches out a controlled and natural performance as a middle aged man who is vexed with his married life. Scarlett Johansson plays a newly wed wife who is also frustrated with her marriage life.Both find comfort and solace in each other's companionship during the week they spend in the Hotel. The only weak link in the movie is Scarlett Johansson. She isn't much convincing . Some other actress in her role could have done proper justice to her role.But it is a very warm and heartfelt love story that is not to be missed by fans of the romance genre. I probably will love it more the second time.9.1\10",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Brief Encounter,"'Lost in Translation' is almost like a modern version of 'Brief Encounter': two lonely people meet, and fail to have sex. And if the absence of (implied) sex made David lean's film unusual, then 'Lost in Translation' is even more of an oddity, in today's hyper-sexualised world (and especially in the hyper-hyper sexualised world of the movies). But there are some differences: train travel has been replaced by plane travel (although distance from home is a key part of both films), there's a lower key feel (no romantic music) and, most crucially, the element of tragedy is missing. In 'Brief Encounter', the sense was that the two protagonists really should have had a wild affair; in Lost in Translation', by contrast, although they could have had an affair, there's no sense that their lives would actually have been enhanced by doing so: they're world-weary rather than repressed, even at Scarlett Johansson's tender age. And for me, this took the sting out of the story: it was hard to invest anything emotional in the plot, because the plot's self-evident point was that it wasn't going to go anywhere. The connection of the protagonists wasn't even very deep. Perhaps it felt just too like real, every-day modern life to me (except for the wealth and beauty of its characters). I spend a lot of time travelling, some of it lonely, making brief but essentially insignificant connections. I don't expect anyone to make a film about me!Beyond that, the movie takes a few liberties in inaccurately merging the sense of alienation that comes from being abroad with the very different sense of alienation that comes from staying in a five-star hotel; but that's forgivable, and I like the indirect way that the movie depicts their experiences. Bill Murray deadpans his way through the story skillfully but neither of the two lead characters appears to possess any notable qualities, beyond being alone and in Japan. And while I actually liked this film; I failed to discover its stand out qualities also.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Not a romantic comedy - a movie about friendship,"Contrary to expectations, this isn't a romantic comedy. It's a movie about friendship. And that's what I loved about it.It's incredibly refreshing to see a movie in which men and women are friends without the constant ""when are they going to sleep together?"" vibe of most hollywood flicks. There is a bit of tension between the two, but mostly they're just friends.This is a beautiful little movie. The performances are flawless, not just from Bill Murray, but from Scarlett Johansson. They can both show emotions without the over-the-top weeping and screaming of many 'better' actors, and don't mind making real life seem both funny and sad at the same time - which it often is. It's not a laugh out loud comedy, but if you don't leave the cinema smiling, it's your own fault.This reminded me of Almodovars All About My Mother, not thematically or plot-wise, but simply because they are beautiful, touching, life affirming little movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Murray and Johansson are a fine pair in a good movie- B+,"Sophia Coppola's Lost in Translation isn't a film that moves at a particularly speedy pace, and I suppose I should've expected that. A lot of times her characters seem to be enclosed within the city of Tokyo, the buildings and Asian ambiance shining onto the American characters like some kind of alien presence they're not used to. I liked her usage of the atmosphere of the city, and how she took time to tell the story.  Although at times some of the conversations between the characters either a) weren't too interesting or b) the answers to the questions they asked each other were sort of self-explanatory when we see the characters by themselves within their hotel rooms for stretches of time. While she didn't make a great movie, she did do a competent enough job as a director to let her two leads, Bill Murray and Scarlet Johansson, give off the some of the most touching performances of the year.In fact, this is a film that Bill Murray fans have been waiting a while for (his best work at getting inside a role since 98's Rushmore): a character who is has humor, yet only because it helps him (as well as us) feel comfortable around such odd people. He plays Bob Harris, an actor who can't get work in the states and, like other real life actors, goes to appear in advertisements in other countries. In the hotel bar, drinking the whiskey he helps to sell (regretfully, we learn, as he wants to act in plays), he meets a complete stranger names Charlotte (Johansson), who is tagging along, more or less, with her celebrity photographer husband (Giovanni Ribisi). They befriend each other, hang around each other out of something between boredom and loneliness, and the film chronicles their encounters, a small event or two that would be expected to come out of real life, and it's done without romance one would expect in any conventional story.There is humor in the film, which helps ease the feeling that the film lingers longer than it should here and there, but it's executed with a sweetness, a reality that proves again what makes Murray one of the best of the post-SNL actors. For example, there's a scene where Charlotte goes to get a black toe examined, and Bob waits in the waiting room next to a weird little Japanese guy who's just smiling. He starts to talk to Bob, giving a gesture with his finger to point out something about the world, and Bob follows along imitatively bringing out some earned laughs not at the little guy, but with him like Bob does. Such moments could've made Lost in Translation a great movie, and in terms of film acting it nearly is. Maybe I just saw too many moments where there was pandering, or lingering for the next good scene.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

He also gave me a few chuckles here or there. The young Scarlett Johansson was also good in her role. There were good supporting nods by Giovanni Ribisi and Anna Faris as well.Overall, this is a good film but overrated to some degree. This film was obviously made by a talented director, Sofia Coppola. But, I wanted more to happen. It just seemed like nothing happens in this movie except people meeting each other and being friends.

Some people are never meant to be. Or are they?,"Lost in Translation is a film whose meaning varies with perception. It could be like a piece of art for some; beautiful is its every fabric. It might be an ocean for others, deep and thought provoking. And for a few, it can even be a symphony, well-composed, soothing and touching. Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is an actor traversing the descending slope of his career. He looks haggard, past his fifties, is not entirely happy with his married life and is now stuck in Japan, shooting for an advertisement for Suntory whiskey. Charlotte is a newly married girl, just done with her graduation. Her husband is a busy man. She is lonely. Bob and Charlotte meet; an unlikely couple. In an alien land where even the language is unknown to them, they find solace in one another - he a father with half his days gone, she a young woman who doesn't know her purpose in life. But some things are never meant to be. Or are they?The movie doesn't have a plot it has a story in the form of observations made through the eyes of its protagonists. The story evokes the tenderest of your emotions as you see two distraught people trying to come to terms with their lives. The atmosphere is melancholy, but it doesn't permeate into your heart. Instead, you can't help but marvel at the subtle perfection of the build-up. There are times when the camera focuses on things in the foreground, but the blurred, Christmas-like red, blue, yellow and other resplendent lights in the background catch your eye, which when keenly observed, not only help in developing the environment, but are also a visual delight. The movie has been shot in a dim-light which suits its air. It is also symbolic of the desolateness encroaching Bob's and Charlotte's existence. The soundtrack is like drops of rain echoing through still surroundings. It is soft, but it resonates with the situation. Every scene of the film has been adroitly made by the director, Sofia Coppola. The things that have been shown on screen are more meaningful than they appear, and as you contemplate over them, things are revealed, the realization of which is sheer bliss.The film handles emotions like newly born babies. It carries them steadily throughout, before reaching a gradual crescendo. Despite its dismal settings, there isn't a moment that causes ennui. It has been tinged with Bill Murray's sardonic sense of humour and causes an odd sense of joy, one that isn't reflected outside but fills you with fuzzy warmth - like happy memories of antiquity.How does one complain against Bill Murray? With his performance in this movie, he just reasserts what a sublime actor he is. He is witty and cynical, but unhappy and despondent. He works with a nonchalant air. Though he is old enough to be Charlotte's dad, he carries the role with grace. Murray doesn't pretend to be Bob Harris; he is the man.Despite the pressure of having a man like Murray opposite her, Scarlett Johansson does an impressive job as Charlotte. She is sensitive, innocent and unprepared for the hardships of the world; that is why you feel sorry for her. She remains silent through all her ordeals, and that shows her inner strength. The two blend well together, each giving a simple, but unforgettable performance in their own way.A subtle yet distinct feature of the film is that the voice of a person speaks about his/her personality. Both Bob and Charlotte are soft spoken and their character is likewise - soft, brooding and thoughtful. They remain like that through the movie - never loud, never brash - and so does their persona. There are others, some overwrought, some morbid and some that talk really fast, which are all reflections of who the people are - gregarious, depressed and overworked, in that order.Japan has been shown in the best light possible, without there being pretension of any sort. Even the mere sight of the monks and temples makes you feel at peace with yourself. They have shown the sunrise against the skyscrapers - the former a breathtaking beauty, the latter proof of Japan's phenomenal growth. The Japanese are a study in contrast to their American counterparts - they are excited, perpetually joyous and very outspoken. They love their guests and are infatuated with their language, even though they are horrendously lousy at it and never get the 'r' and 'l' correct.Lost in Translation is a very niche film. It isn't for those who try and find a purpose in everything that happens. It can only be appreciated by people who notice its serenity and realize that the journey is often worth more than the goal. As for the end, it is truly spellbinding. It will mean different things to different people, like the movie has been specially designed to suit your imagination.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Don't Waste Your Time,"This is a movie based on a lot of media hype.  I don't understand how Sofia Coppola won Best Director for this picture or why Bill Murray was a nominee for Best Actor.  There's nothing even remotely outstanding about the film , its direction, or performances (Murray seems to be sleepwalking through the whole film).  It's mediocre at best.The film is slow and very linear.  Nothing exciting happens.  There are no ups and downs.  No plot.  Basically, I kept waiting for something (anything!) to happen but it never does.  It got to the point where my mind started wandering during the film because it just couldn't keep my attention.It focuses mostly on the budding love of the two main characters, who are both married and staying at the same hotel in Tokyo.  There's nothing original about it, and Coppola's directing is too safe and ""sweet"".There are a lot of good shots of ultra-modern Tokyo that are nice, but its comedy relies on taking little shots at those ""silly"" Japanese by showing all the ways in which they do things differently in Japan.  I guess that never gets old for some.In conclusion, if you're torn between renting this movie and some other movie at the video store...pick the other one.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Glorified Vacation Video,"I know people seem to love this film, and you know, more power to them. But there's just something about it that rubs me the wrong way. I'm all for minimalism... being slow to reveal what happens in your story, etc.... but this film had nothing. It was nothing. It was a completely autobiographical piece where Sofia used Ms. Johansen as her doppleganger to complain about the distant relationship with her then-husband, and to comment on human loneliness.But there's a good way to comment on human loneliness, and a bad way. This, undeniably, is one of the worst ways. Static, quiet stretches where nothing interesting is happening. sure, its artsy and pretentious, but it doesn't really prove anything except that the writer is uncreative, both in her subject matter (a vacation to Tokyo) and the way she spends her time (inane nothingness, rather than productivity).Much like Was Anderson, this film seems to revel in wasting Bill Murray. A comedic genius, he is degraded into acting bored for almost three hours. Why is this? Why do people think Bill Murray acting bored is funny? The man is capable of great things, yet unimaginative hacks make careers on sticking a camera at him as he deadpans. Its insulting.I do not truly think this movie deserves a ""1,"" but with so many people who want to appear intelligent or ""with it"" giving it a ""10,"" I feel its my place to offset it. Much poorer than most people would have you believe, and utterly uncreative. It made me wish Sofia Copolla had never been born.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I loved this movie,"I've read through the comments on this site and I think several people may have missed the point. In fact, I read some of the comments and thought ""did these people see the same movie?""This was a beautiful movie. The cinematography was stunning. And it wasn't just the fact that it was Japan that made it stunning - I live in New York, I'm used to lights, and flash, and crowds..... A lot of people have commented on the stereotypes of Japanese culture - the ""l"" for the ""r"", the ""Vegas"" atmosphere.... yadda yadda. But it's the use of those things (stereotypical though they may be), and the alternating slowness and hurry of the film that give it such resonance, particularly for those of us from Western cultures.The beauty comes through from more than just the pictures. It's both a love story and a coming of age story (to quote a prior comment). These things aren't mutually exclusive. And revelation is not the point. The restraint that another person commented on is part of the beauty. We've all been there. Life is complicated. Touching another person, either physically or emotionally, is complicated. But there's a simplicity to the relationship between Charlotte and Bob that belies the complexity of human relationships. Touching another person is also simple.I cried at the end. The final scene between Charlotte and Bob was perfect. The jealousy Charlotte felt was perfect. If they had had more, it would have been less of a movie. We all expect the protagonists to come together at the end. But they can't and they won't and that's what makes the relationship so real and wonderful. Throughout this movie, you can't help but think that these two have more in common with each other than anyone else - that's why their spouses have to be such marginal figures in the film. They are soulmates, however little they know each other. They recognize each other. And we - those of us who have ever felt the loneliness of crowds, who have ever felt apart and adrift - recognize it too. You, as a film-goer, want them to be together. You're conditioned by the story to want that. But life is equally that simple and equally that complicated.I completely adored this movie. When I saw The Virgin Suicides I thought that Sofia Coppola might be a genius. Now I know that she is. I'm sure she would be uncomfortable with the moniker, but I hope that she continues making movies. Because I love movies of any sort, but I've never been more touched and moved than I have been from hers.And, dear Lord, would that I could have her ability to find the most amazing soundtracks.",,Anonymous,Comedy

An amazing film.,"Sofia Coppola's tale of friendship and loneliness is a near pitch-perfect film and the best I've seen so far this year.  It's also Bill Murray's best performance.  He is nothing short of amazing playing a has-been actor with whom the Japanese are still infatuated.The story takes place over a week period in Tokyo as we are introduced to Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and Charlotte, played with much maturity by Scarlet Johannson. They are both stuck in a culture they don't understand and marriages they aren't sure are working anymore.  Charlotte's husband (Giovanni Ribisi) is a photographer who is always on a shot and leaves her in the hotel to fend for herself.She wanders around Tokyo and Bob keeps himself in the hotel bar where Charlotte finally bumps into him and a friendship is slowly developed.  This friendship saves them from the aching loneliness visually displayed by Sofia in long, beautiful shots of Johannson sitting in the hotel window looking out over the sprawling metropolis of Tokyo and Murray trying to find anything on Japanese television he can connect with.Don't get me wrong.  This is not a downer movie.  It is one of such various and vast emotions that I'm surprised Sofia fits them in to one little movie.  There are moments of great laughter and joviality such as the ""gift"" that is sent to Bob's room. But even when when Charlotte and Bob's adventure begins it is quite apparent they are still not truly happy especially when they end up at a Karaoke bar and you get to see Murray's character singing Roxy Music's heart-breaking ""More Than This"".Some people may find the slight fun poking at the Japanese a little too much, but it's meant to show just how different their culture and ours are so different.  A few scene are down right gut-busting and others just drive the character's actions as they try to something to hold on to they can identify with.  It's an amazing cornucopia of events and emotions.I found out, too, that Sofia went to Tokyo many times with her father, Francis Ford Coppola (you may have heard of him), and I wonder if they story is somewhatautobiographical.  Did she met a has-been actor when she was left behind in the hotel room as her father went off to do some film work?  Either way, Sofia has made a small masterpiece that proves that she did indeed get the filmmaker gene.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
An Existentialist Movie With Purpose,"The first time I saw ""Lost In Translation,"" I found it to be dull, pointless, and rather alienating. However, after having watched it again a few more times thereafter, I finally saw the immense beauty of the film. Bob Harris and Charlotte, the main characters of the film, are in search of meaning...of a translation. They want to know what their lives translate to...what their purpose is. As the two find themselves hopelessly lost in their search, they discover each other. They find out that sometimes there is no certain definition to life and that those who try to define it find themselves losing its essential meaning. I think that's the beauty of this film...the message that so much is lost through translation...so much of the real things in life are overlooked in the process of trying to understand them.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"A moving, sensitive film","It is one of the most moving films that I have seen of recent times. Having spent a little time in Japan, I had a real feel for the way that the Japanese people and their culture is shown, and just how easy it is to feel lost and out of place in a culture that one is not used to. The two main rolls are very believable, and I can't agree with anyone who thinks that it is insensitive to Japanes, it is just the reverse. Full marks to this film. It is good to see a film maker who is prepared to make a film that does not follow all the usual trends and predictable story lines.

Bill Murray's Sweet Spot,"The more I see Bill Murray in roles like this the more I see him playing his trump card. I thank him for picking such great scripts/directors (see his participation with Wes Anderson, ""Rushmore"" & ""Royal Tenenbaums"" for more of his ""sweet spot"" performances).Sofia Coppola scores again with ""Lost in Translation"" (prior was Virgin Suicides). I actually felt ""Lost"" had a Wes Anderson feel to the film. If you did like this film/theme I would also recommend ""Before Sunrise"" with Ethan Hawke (sans the humor).Scarlett Johansson was amazing. I last remember her in ""Ghost World"" (also an excellent film) where she made an impression on me... terrific performance.This has been the best film I've seen in the last three years... great story (though some may not see some of the deeper meanings), great bunch of actors and a wonderful emerging director.I may have had one gripe at the beginning of the film... basically fun at the expense of the Japanese culture... but then later in the film there would be beautiful scenes of the finer more complex points of Japanese culture that said ""we are not just a micro-electronic based culture, but one of a majestic past and rich culture.""This is such a wonderful film, please take the chance and see it.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
This Translation Gets Murky,"Lost in Translation is an interesting film by Sofia Coppola. As usual I won't get into the retelling of the details of the story as that's always thoroughly covered by the vast majority of reviews here. Generally speaking though the two principal leads are Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson. They are presented as lost souls, adrift in their own lives and by chance happen to connect while they are each visiting Tokyo and its their relationship/connection that they forge during this random and brief time that is the focus of the film. Both Murray and Johansson do good work here and Murray in particular creates a real, believable character that the audience can relate to. Or I should say those of us who have actually felt lost and adrift at some point in our own lives. If that is the case then you might also connect with Johansson's character instead, or perhaps in different ways to both of these characters. It's a film that can be prudent with its dialogue but not with its feeling and emotions. This film is definitely not for everyone, it will be too slow, or the feeling that nothing really happens. However, for the rest of us who have also felt lost and adrift it will be an interesting, relatable, and entertaining experience. You know who you are and if you should see this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The worst film I have ever seen,"I should preface this review by saying that my husband and I both have advanced degrees, and we see 50+ independent films a year.  So filmic subtlety is not lost on us.   We drove for an hour through horrendous traffic to see this highly-rated film, yet this is the only movie in 25 years of adult moviegoing that we have ever walked out of.  It reminded me of the worst excesses of 60's French New Wave.  Long stretches of people staring.  Long stretches of silence and monosyllables.  More long stretches of loud noise and incomprehensible voices.  Short cut-in scenes that advanced the story (what there was of it) and characters not a bit.  We get it; we get it--these people are ALIENated. Big deal.Can I care about two people who are supposed to be intelligent, yet they can't think of a thing to do to amuse themselves in one of the world's major cities? Can I believe in a young woman who's supposed to be a recent philosophy graduate of Yale, who can't think of anything to do with her time but stare out the window of her expensive hotel?  Can I believe this same young woman came to Tokyo with her working husband, yet seems totally at a loss when he actually leaves to work?  Can I believe that someone who is interested in philosophy so much that she majors in it in college can only be happy bar hopping, dancing, smoking weed, and singing karaoke?  Can I believe that a faded Hollywood star who is being paid 2 million dollars for a commercial would come to Tokyo absolutely alone, without even an aide of any kind?And most of all, can I call a film that does nothing more than follow these two hapless and uninteresting people around for several days without a trace of drama or art profound?I think not.  Don't waste your money.  This is one of those rare instances when I can only conclude that there is some vast critical conspiracy to hoodwink the American public.  Surprise!

A Japanese reaction,"Well, this is not a review, just a comment, right? I'm Japanese and I was there in Tokyo when Sofia and other clans like Hiromix and Nigo were firing the town in 90's. I didn't say I was with them, I was just living there. So, to me the scene Bob and Charlotte meets Charlie Brown was a bit nostalgic and I confirmed Sofia enjoyed her time in 90's Tokyo. Clubs and Karaoke scenes really have some exciting and romantic feels.Johansson is so like Sofia. I don't know Sofia Coppola personally but the movie makes me feel like I know her well. Nice... work of art.And cinematography. wow. Believe me, Tokyo overall is not cute or bladerunnery as seen in LiT. Sofia just shot it like that. In my humble eyes Tokyo or Kyoto is like the same old gray, faceless, nervous big city, but in her eyes it wasn't. And of course, it's not a matter of true or false.It was kind of itchy when I saw this film. It's like a tale of Pygmalion, people never get to know each other completely. We know just what we are ready to know. But often we want others to know ourselves completely and immediately. The great Bill Murray looked like saying 'scratch my heart'.It was so hopeless when I was in a foreign land and lost the life track and someone who meant so much to me. I imagine how hard Charlotte needed a person like Bob at that time.Glad to have a film like this from LA.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The film that kick started my obsession with Japan,"I saw this film when I was 23, I loved it, I remember when the credits started rolling, I stood up but paused half way walking out of the cinema then stared at the credits with a big smile on my face knowing I would rave about this film to friends, although I did not have to, everyone in my friends circle at the time loved this film.Went to Japan a year later and was blown away, I think Japan was at its best from the late 80s to the 2010's I visited a month before the big 2011 quake, how this relates to the film, I think the actors are great however I think the spirit of tokyo city plays a big part in this film, the title lost in translation is how you feel sometimes in Japan, a complete stranger who finds themselves in strange and wonderful situations but can only observe to see what happens as you sometimes don't know how to interact, what the expectations are or values behind each interaction, a perfect setting for a film like this, pure genius on Sophia's behalf, if you see the making of Lost in Translation you could tell Sophia was very excited because she knew exactly what she was making and it turned out great, probably one of the top 5 films of the 2000, 2010 era, at least its always been at the top of the list for me. 10/10 a perfect film, its perceived flaws with its incidental settings are its silver lining.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Found in Translation,"Two nights, two Sophia Coppola films. First one, ""Somewhere,"" inspired harakiri. The second film, which is ironically set in Japan, was beautiful. Truly, this is one of the best films I have ever seen. For all the lonely souls, and we've all been there, this translates on every level. Murray and Johansson, I'm a guy, so especially Johansson, are just wonderful -- magic really. Check it out.The system says I have to write ten lines or my review won't be accepted so let me say a few more nice things about this film and the first film, ""Somewhere."" I can see now why Sophia Coppola used the long camera shots in Somewhere. She was conveying the boredom experienced by a lost person who is living an improbable and empty life. We're all ""somewhere"" but it's a drag when that feels like nowhere. I was probably a bit harsh on ""Somewhere."" The film just sort of works on you after a day or two. I appreciate Somewhere more after seeing Lost in Translation. Murray and Johansson share a lifetime in a brief fugitive moment of authentic joy -- soul to soul. I am sure Johansson's lips have something to do with it but her character, and Murray together was something to see. What a lovely experience. Thank you Sophia Coppola.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Good movie, but not for everyone because of its subtlety","Many reviewers say that some people don't get this film, because they cannot understand its purpose, that of a slow and subtle story that tells about loneliness, aimlessness and feeling detached from your own life. Thus there seem to be two kinds of people: those who love this movie for its ability to tell a story with minimal plot and those who hate it because it's boring and nothing happens.I'm somewhere in the middle. I didn't think that nothing happens, but I actually thought that it lacked something. There are a lot of shots where people just seem to exist side by side, sitting somewhere or lying around on their beds. Sure, those shots are needed, because they relate the feeling of having nothing important to do, one of the key themes of this film, but they're not very interesting to witness. And that's this movie, intellectually interesting and yeah, I can relate to these characters, because I've had days when I've felt like they do throughout this whole film, but the film is a bit boring.So, is it a bad film? Not at all. The imagery, for one, is extremely pleasing, and the modern day Japan is portrayed beautifully with its old traditions that are beginning to mix with the phenomena of today. Plus Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson are both powerful actors that give brilliant performances. Final thoughts, it's a good movie, but it's not for those that want their movies fast and furious, with high emotions and flashy action scenes.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I've sorta been through this,"Although not through the romance tension I hasten to add. I have a very happy relationship with my golden treasure of a wife.I've been to China a few times now and they have a social etiquette structure very similar to the Japanese when it comes to dealing with Westerners.Not many of them speak English and those that do always give you a very condensed version of what's been said in the local language. The problem is that they always leave out any social nuances.You never really know what they think of you as a person because they generally see you as a strange other species, or as a novelty. They will talk about you as if you weren't in the same room and have no hesitation in excluding you from conversations with their friends.
Westerners consider that rude but it's been explained to me many times that you don't have to be included if the conversation's not about you... go figure!And so you are... ""lost"".You get no clue from the written language as to where you are, or what kind of establishment you're in, because it's not something you can voice and you have no idea as to how their alphabet works. They carry on talking to you in their own language because they assume that you can understand.It's not all a bad experience, as they are unfailingly polite, generous and hospitable but it can be very frustrating to feel like you're the main act in a circus.In this movie that aspect is displayed very realistically and the karaoke scenes could have been filmed in any of the social gatherings I attended during my visits. If you don't participate they just carry on as if you weren't there and assume that you must be enjoying yourself because everyone else is having a hoot.I really like the way they capture the essence of the style of the American chain hotels in the Orient.
They are chrome, glass and velvet with low light chandeliers. They are executive themed, they always have someone on the piano throwing out muzak and each and every one that I've visited reminded me of Hugh Hefner's Playboy Mansion.So the director caught every subtle cultural difference and every nexus.If I had any issue with the film at all, it's that it does leave you feeling unresolved, but I think that's Sofia's point.Murray and Johansson put in excellent performances, they are like air bubbles floating in a champagne glass, which is how I felt most of the time I was in that part of the world.
The story will mean much more to people who have already travelled to countries with completely different symbols for writing and expressing ideas.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
fantastic,"I saw this film at its North American premiere at the Toronto Film Festival, and I'm already telling everyone I know how great this movie is.The screening was great, with the audience laughing at the right moments and quietly observing the dramatic moments. Sofia Coppola and Scarlette Johansson were at the screening (and I'm pretty sure I saw Francis Ford Coppola taking a seat).Bill Murray and Scarlette Johansson give amazing performances, especially in the moments when they convey emotions without speaking. These performances were of course brought on by Sofia Coppola's sensitive and powerful directions.Sofia Coppola has really stepped up from the Virgin Suicides with Lost in Translation. I love almost everything about this film - the beautiful visuals of Tokyo's city landscapes, the music (similar to the Virgin Suicides soundtrack), the unconventional bond between Bob and Charlette, the loneliness of these characters, and their search for meaning in their lives...All in all this is a beautiful film.

Lost Without Translation,"As an American who travels to Japan frequently, I found this film parochially American. I also found it offensive.The parochial part is the fact that the Japanese dialog is presented without subtitles. It is, of course, intended to convey the notion of a totally bewildering environment for the main characters. Unfortunately for the film, I understood the Japanese dialog almost perfectly--as do millions of Japanese, so I cannot feel that sense of bewilderment.It's offensive to the Japanese. There is one scene in the film--at a hospital--that would never happen in Japan. No hospital--I don't care how tiny--would persist on speaking pure Japanese if they sensed the patient did not understand. They would do their best to speak understandably or find someone who can, and English speakers abound in hospitals.Another offensive part is the notion that Hollywood is trying to present its own morality as somehow acceptable and even majestic. The principle character, a washed-up actor older than dirt, finds a normal monogamous marriage somehow draining enough to be attracted to a female child (in her very early twenties) while on a business trip away. Sorry, it may be a normal reaction for an older man to be so attracted--but it hardly qualifies at any sympathetic level. This female child, also in a monogamous married relationship and similarly drained, finds this geezer somehow appealing enough to approach him in a manner that is hard to confuse with anything but a come-on.I'm not going to go into how far the relationship develops, but it can safely be put into the unfaithful category as far as their spouses are concerned.

OK, good story, but Sofia has concentrated so much on showing how bored and sad these two are that makes you bored too.

The Most Overrated Film of 2003,"First of all, unlike many viewers who disliked ""Lost in Translation"", I did not disliked it because it ""lacks plot"" or because ""nothing happens"". Cinema has proved, over 40 years ago, that Cinema is not Literature, and therefore plots can be subdued.However, unlike Films such as ""Before Sunrise"", Lost in Translation doesn't work. You never seem to believe that Bob and Charlotte are having actual fun, instead it seems like they are PRETENDING to have fun. The main problem is that unlike ""Sunrise"", their relationship never feels natural, and you can always tell that there's a script behind their dialogue.This is, obviously, non-intentional, which harms the film to a great extent, specially since it is not as clever or as atmospheric as it think its. Indeed, all the little atmosphere the film has is due to the excellent soundtrack and to the inherent charm Tokyo has, NOT because of Coppola's skills or the extremely dark and plain Cinematography. (the average film goer seems to love it for some reason. Anyone can shoot buildings from inside a car, and the interiors are poorly lit, at all times)While Murray and Johansson are solid in their own respective parts, they lack any chemistry, and the same goes for Ribisi and Faris. In fact, Faris should not be in this picture, but apparently Sofia Coppola felt we needed a little bit of her personal problems (shown in an extremely literal manner) on the screen.To sum it up, this one could've been a Cult Classic, one of the great off-beat Romance Films in Cinema History. Unfortunately, due to Coppola's spoiled-girl Direction and amateuristic skills and editing, it's simply ""cute"".6/10",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Somebody nudge me, I've dozed off...","With all the hype and Oscar nominations, I was expecting something special from this film.  Yes, it's different from usual Hollywood fodder, but different doesn't necessarily mean worthwhile or even remotely good.It's a terribly boring film.  In waiting for something, anything, to actually happen, I thought I'd at least enjoy some comedic moments from Bill or be charmed by Scarlett, but neither happens.  Bill looks as thoroughly bored as the audience, and only Scarlett's dashing smile differentiates her from the background.Self-indulgent tedium.  In a city as happening as Tokyo, it makes no sense for the characters to be bored to tears.  I really hope that this film fails to garner any Oscars - to do so would only encourage Ms Coppola to give us more of this.  I'll tread more carefully with her next offering.....",,Anonymous,Comedy
Solid film produces unique results,"I was one of those who liked this film.  Part of the reason was that it was unlike any other film I've seen.  It is funny, it is occasionally sad as it focuses on isolation in the midst of crowds, sleeplessness in a comfy hotel room.  It is beautiful, but occasionally shows us the ugly side of Tokyo as well.  It makes us like the characters without shirking from their dark sides.Murray put in one of his best performances here.  He is utterly believable, playing a version of himself or a Steve McQueen style reclusive star forced by his financial obligations to a Japanese liquor company to spend a week in Tokyo.Johannsen is showing herself off very well here.... this may well be the movie that makes her mark; at the very least she will have made some kind of lasting contribution to film that will be remembered in times to come.Not for fans of movies that dwell on ""action action ACTION!"", more like Swedish ""slice of life"" films or the Russian epics of Tarkovsky.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Finally a real film,"I've never written a review before but after watching this 10 years after its release I felt compelled to.Sofia Coppola has crafted an extremely gripping yet distant film that explores the very poignant and deep questions about human life. Now this alone doesn't sound impressive or different from many other titles but the characters, bob and Charlotte, are the ones who define lost in translation as a film that REALLY does explore the feeling of being lost.The ideas that are conveyed are thrown right at you, softly and invite you to think and wonder not just about the characters but also yourself. It's thought provoking beyond belief - a trait around 20% of films hold these days.A film that makes you think for days after you've watched it defines a good film for me, and this is exactly what this does.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Once in a long while...,"Once in a great while, even longer that it takes me to write another one of these reviews, there comes a movie that just happens to hit you at the right moment, that perfect space in your life that was designed to fit just a story like this one, told in the subtle and unobtrusive manner that you needed to really let go and feel alongside the characters on screen. Now it could be that I am leading you all down this path only to say, ""Well this wasn't one of those movies."", but that would be just plain mean and I'm not like that... Right?Right. This movie is one of those movies.Written and directed by Sofia Coppola (daughter of Francis Ford Coppola, also the director of the visually poetic ""The Virgin Suicides"") this is a simple tale with very simple feelings told in a setting of mass confusion in downtown Tokyo. We follow two drifting souls, Bob Harris (played wonderfully by Bill Murray, credits are unnecessary) who is a big time movie actor tumbling down the ladder of fame until we pick up his trail shooting whiskey commercials for the Eastern market, and Charlotte (played with smooth seduction by Scarlett Johansson, also in ""The Horse Whisperer"", ""Ghost World"" and ""The Man Who Wasn't There"") who is married to a photographer working in Tokyo and left with little to do and little to feel from her husband. When these two finally meet up, we get to witness that quirky sidestepping routine of small talk mixed with boundary searching subtext. If this story was left in the hands of someone much less adept at keeping a lusciously slow pace we might have found our two protagonists/ antagonists (because to them, they are one and the other) getting some back alley divorces by act two, but Sofia Coppola knows it's about more than that, it's about more than just the hook up. People have so many other ways to prove themselves to each other and show that they care beyond the lusty romp in the sack. As we watch, songs are sung (and not half bad either), glances are shared and even a small touch of hand to foot, but the bridges being built there are stronger by that fact alone.Riding on the wave of success from ""Rushmore"", Bill Murray has not stopped daring to impress and he succeeds here once again. I think this has a lot to do with the general consensus amongst the young and hip filmmakers that Murray is a much deeper fellow than the slovenly groundskeeper he became a star from in ""Caddyshack"". He unleashes a depth in this film, a distance behind his eyes that shows a man who's life is turned out to be everything he didn't want. When he meets up with Scarlett's character, it's that distance that we can see shrinking, collapsing that fading light in his eyes and rejuvenating it. He plays along with being young again around her, but not so much as to truly forget where he is and what his character has back in the states (a emotionally distant wife and kids that are growing used to him not being there). Scarlett's character, on the other hand, is just beginning her trip of self-doubt and aimless wanderings, which is captured on film by numerous scenes (almost too many) of her just walking around to different Buddhist temples or just plain staring out the window. Johnasson's presence on screen belies her youth (she's only 18) and comes at a time when the young and blond market is threatening to be cornered by Disney dropouts. Her voice is is softly graveled and this helps push her beyond her age, but even before that vocal tone developed people were talking about her stunning performance in ""The HorseWhisperer"" at 13 years old. In this performance, she becomes the epitome of youthful doubt and wondering, yearning to find that direction in life after college is over. She handles the screen with Murray without a hint of fear and pushes back with an equal amount of vulnerability and courage, which can sometimes be one and the same. Her career is teetering on the edge of skyrocketing with upcoming performances in ""The Girl with the Pearl Earring"" and ""A Love Song for Bobby Long"" where in both films she continues this trend of being somewhat of a temptress/muse to older men. Keep your eyes and hearts open for this girl.How to conclude a review that is so obviously positive towards the film? I would just say, go see it. There's a handful of moments in this picture that every filmmaker strives for, a true connection without words, or at least without spoken words (a wonderful Karaoke scene exempts itself) and it all caps off with what I feel to be one of the truest endings I've seen in years. I can't honestly say that this would lack much from not catching it on the big screen, but for me, my heart certainly would have lacked from not catching it as soon as I could.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Universal Language,"This is a great movie, but not perfect. The opening butt scene is unpleasantly inscrutable...what's that all about? I'm all for abstraction, butt not for it's own sake. I sense that Sophia Coppola stuck that in just because she could. It makes no sense and is thus offensive- not morally- logically.My other criticism is that the night on the town scene was about 10 minutes toooo long. We get the point, already. It's a wild and crazy town and Americans are disharmonious with it. Out of tune, out of sync.Charlotte and Bob are also out of sync within their own lives. The external mis-fit reflects their internal mis-fit. They are both lost in translation within as well as without.All of which has nada to do with the introductory butt. Sorry, I can't get past that one.The Japanese people were not stereotyped or maligned. They were depicted as vibrant, accepting of Americans, welcoming, and simply dancing to the beat of a way different drummer. They were not even offended at being viewed sideways by two jaded foreigners in their midst. I wonder if Americans would have been as polite if the circumstances were reversed.I loved the hilarious touches woven throughout the film, the tuxedo clips and the ""lip my stockings"" will stay with me for a long time. And forget about Nordic skiing! This is a wonderful film that flows two disparate cultures and people in somewhat the same direction, touching but not touching, connecting but not connecting, lovely but lonely.Sans the butt, this would have been a 10 for me.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A connection in the distance,"Sometimes, a film manages to capture what we feel but cannot express in words. That sense of emptiness and disconnection that, somehow, holds within it a spark of hope and understanding. This story explores the meeting of two lost souls, far from home and from themselves, in a city that pulses like another character, filled with lights, chaos, and a deafening silence. Tokyo becomes the perfect backdrop for a tale where every glance and every pause speaks louder than any dialogue.Bill Murray delivers a masterful performance, portraying a man trapped between the weight of his past and an apathy that seems to consume him. Scarlett Johansson, with her freshness and vulnerability, is the perfect counterpart. Together, they build a connection so subtle and authentic that it's impossible not to see yourself in it at some point. There's a humanity in them that transcends the screen, a chemistry that doesn't need grand gestures to move you.Sofia Coppola's direction demonstrates exceptional maturity. Her ability to find beauty in the everyday and transform seemingly simple moments into unforgettable ones is a gift to the viewer. Every scene is imbued with a melancholy that touches the soul, while the music-especially the closing with ""Just Like Honey"" by The Jesus & Mary Chain-feels like a comforting embrace that simultaneously leaves an open wound.This is a story about improbable connections, about what it means to truly be seen, even when you feel invisible to yourself. It speaks of time and how, sometimes, all we need is for someone to take our hand in the midst of our loneliness. That connection, fleeting yet unforgettable, is a reminder that even in the deepest emotional distance, there can be beauty.Finally, the film achieves something remarkable: it turns the ordinary into something profoundly moving. It reminds us that, in the simplest of moments, we often find the most profound emotions. Stories like this invite us to look inward and cherish the connections that leave a mark on us-those that, even when they belong to the past, continue to beat strongly in the present.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Please see this...,"Subtlety is an art.  When it is recognized, normally people see it as boring.  In the words of Sarah Silverman, it can be ""an infomercial for boring.""  Anyway, Lost In Translation is absolutely captivating.  I have never been to East Asia, but I have been around the world.  At one end, this movie could be a spring break fling (keep in mind that there is no bikini contest in this movie).  I assure you that it is not.  For anyone that has been in dark hotel in another land (not necessarily a bad thing) in the lounge and seen someone across the room and just wanted to know them more than through a simple smile, this movie fulfills that desire.  Most would be scared to leave their other life for a moment and jump into something else head first.  Lost In Translation is not quite head first but just a toe in the water.  It is so damn moving that I feel special for seeing it.  I like Lord of the Rings and Braveheart, but I assure you that the people who said this movie was boring hold a special place for the two movies I just mentioned.  You have to become emotionally available to this movie in order to enjoy it.  I loved several scenes, especially where Bill Murray sings Roxy Music's ""More than This.""  The look from Scarlett Johansson during this scene is as convincing as any I have seen from any movie in years.  Also, the scene where Murray tees off in the valley of Mount Fuji holds enormous value.  What courage he has to overcome the mountain before him.  you will see at the very end.

"Many great aspects, but Charlotte not believable","Sophia Coppola has shown much of her directing prowess in this movie, but I really feel her development of Charlotte (played by Scarlett Johansson) is lacking. There are many great interactions between Charlotte and Bob Harris (played by Bill Murray), but there aren't any times where Charlotte shows any other facet of her character besides her emptiness and sorrow. Her being that pitiful the entire time she's in Tokyo just makes her unbelievable to me. Real people are multi-faceted. Even when they're distraught or sad, or just feeling empty, they will have those up moments when their inner strength kicks in. Charlotte never displays this. Perhaps there are people out there in the world that are this weak. But I just don't believe it.I wish I wasn't so bothered by the character development of Charlotte because there are some excellent aspects of this film. Many of the shots between Charlotte and Bob are perfectly crafted to convey their underlying connection. And Bob's character is developed well, as he comes across as a real person with multiple facets to his personality. Overall, I would still recommend this movie, especially as a rental. Just don't be surprised if you also notice there's something lacking.6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I must say that watching two bored people chat about nothing has never been brought the big screen with such fidelity before.  I mean, it was just like real life!

Well, if you've never experienced that kind of witty banter, then you're in for a real treat with Lost in Translation.

Ambiance of Japan most interesting part of movie,"I've watched this movie when it first came out 10 years ago. I admit I really liked it and watched it many times. But this is mostly due to the fact I found the shots of Japan to be beautiful and haunting.Besides capturing a beautiful ambiance, I felt the storyline to be rather interesting. Two people sharing a plutonic relationship...I find that to be a refreshing and modern take on relationships. It's like telling a love story that never happens or capturing that special someone you've always thought about but never can or could pursue.But in the end, I felt, perhaps because there were so many scenes that didn't contribute to the overall plot, that the movie was mostly style not substance.

"There no crisis, it's just life.","Why is it always deemed a ""crisis"" when someone isn't happy and desires a change? I've never understood that.Here we have an older, successful man who is, essentially, lost. His career ending, his marriage nothing but a room-mate situation. Like he says, ""we used to have fun"". What he yearns for is someone who will show interest in him, to make him feel alive again, to make him want to eat healthier, to be healthier. He says it all quite clearly and his words echo that of so many men his age, lost in a relationship, or worse, having none at all. And therein lies the rub. There's a saying, ""I am more afraid of what I don't know, than I hate what I have right now"". And that is Bob, until he meets Charlotte. And you can see by the way he acts when he's around here, how he changes. She makes him feel alive again, awakening that 30 year old that lies dormant in almost every man over 50.Charlotte on the other hand is wise beyond her years, possessing an intense quality that the ditzy, annoying Anna Farris character could never have. She needs someone older, and most older men need someone younger. The only ones who have an issue with this are the types like Bob's wife.This is a beautiful film, a painful gut punch of reality for those who get it, those who live it day in and day out, the Bob's and Charlotte's of this world. It's a shame some can't see that.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Well... Bill Murray was good...,"Lost in Translation is a film about a relationship between a faded Hollywood star and a bored wife, set against the background of Tokyo.I'm unsure how to view this movie, if it were a book I think I would characterise it as interesting but poorly written.  The film is very much about a message rather than pure entertainment, and that message is put across as much visually as it is verbally.  The basic message seems to be about the problems with communication that exist at all levels of society, with the difficulties that the main American characters have interacting with Japanese society mirroring their own problems with their own private relationships.  The film manages to get this message across, however I found much of the film dull.  Why all the staring out of windows over Tokyo, staring out of car windows, and wandering around Pachinko parlours.  It gets the message across that people are bored/jet lagged, in a foreign culture, and allows for some nice street scenes of Japan, but all this could have been foregone with a bit more dialogue and acting.  Just because the character is meant to be bored does not mean that the audience has to be bored with them.  Therefore I think several minutes could be cut from the film without damaging the message.  Additionally, the relationship between Murray and Johansson didn't make me feel for either of the characters.  The way I saw it they were both quite selfish, well certainly as selfish as their respective spouses.  And I think this is where the film failed.  You were left asking: A couple of people you don't really feel for are having a boring time on a business trip in Tokyo.  So what?'As for the acting: Bill Murray was excellent (and certainly rescued this film), Johansson was nice to look at, but didn't really say anything of meaning - she seemed characterless,  the assorted Japanese characters were all excellent, Ribisi wasn't really in the movie, and  Faris did a nice cameo as the airhead actress.However, overall I felt although I understood the movie, it was too intellectualtoo cleverbasically required too much work analysing what everything meant rather than generating feelings or enjoying the film.  I almost felt that the film needed a little guidebook to let the viewer know the meaning and symbolism of each shot.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Let's never come here again because it will never be as much fun.,"Bob Harris is in Tokyo to shoot a whiskey commercial. Tired and fed up with his life, he meets an unhappy young wife by the name of Charlotte. Both these jaded souls who are wary of the alien city they are staying in, start to form a friendship that goes deeper than either of them could ever have dreamed possible.I'm a late comer to this movie, only just catching it some six years after its release. With that revelation out the way, I have to say I'm rather annoyed that I didn't let this simple, but beautifully tender picture into my life before now. Lost in Translation has proved to be a most divisive picture, but outside of its overuse of stereotyping Asians for its laughs, I personally don't see any faults. In a time, both then and now, when blockbusters were {are} the main stay of bread winning cinema, Sofia Coppola's film is the perfect anti-dote for those tired by sledge hammer cinema. Blending themes such as fidelity and generational divides is a neat enough premise in itself, but cloaking it in commercialism and a hazy jet lagged fog is something of a masterstroke from Coppola {who also wrote and produced}.What makes this such an intriguing and delicate film is not that it's essentially two different people finding each other, because anyone can make a love story, doomed or otherwise. But that in a film that its detractors claim ""nothing is happening"", it's in fact saying so much. Coppola, by way of two top notch performances from Scarlett Johansson {Charlotte} and Bill Murray {Bob} transports complex ideas superbly. Hope springs eternal for our characters, the problems of communication around them are evident, but in their newly formed world it folds together nicely, secular can be such a special and uplifting thing. The joys of pop music is also brilliantly put on to the screen by the makers, including a quite lovely sequence set around karaoke. Here the beauty of a human connection is well and truly realised.The comedy, of which there is loads, is made to measure for Murray and his sarcastic line in grumpy mid life crisis-with Coppola showing great restraint by knowing when and how to drop it into the mix. The soundtrack is first rate, with the use of The Jesus And Mary Chain's sumptuous ""Just Like Honey"" at the films pivotal moment, being pure genius, and the Tokyo location is a ball of light feast for the eyes. But ultimately it's because of its elegance and its multi stranded themes that Lost In Translation won so many fans back in 2003. I myself am glad to now count myself as one of their number. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

It must be nice to have family in show business!,"If this film had been done by someone outside the Hollywood camp and with all unknown actors, I wonder if it would have gotten any publicity at all. Instead, thinks to an inside track and a star with a name, this movie created more buzz and acclaim than was due anyone who worked on it.There was little to no dialogue, and most of the best lines appear to be spur of moment quips from Bill Murray and nothing more. The movie was unsatisfactory in every area imaginable, from dialogue and story line to cinematography and directing. I was left pondering why this movie got any recognition whatsoever.Before I actually saw the movie was I cheering for Sophia as the only female director getting any recognition, which was unusual especially for her age. I ended up wishing that this was not the movie and she was not the director who was getting this recognition, since it was so undeserved.Having said that, this was not a complete waste of film, it was good for what it was, a first film. It wasn't genius, in fact I have yet to meet anyone who actually liked it or found it interesting. And based on the commentary it has received, the only people who liked it and found it interesting were those who had been to Japan and really enjoyed the culture there.To conclude, we should give this film the credit it deserves and nothing more. As someone who has seen several first films done by college filmography majors, that's where this film belongs. The only thing that differentiates this film is a slightly larger budget and better access to equipment and stars. The only credit it deserves is as a nice first film done at a freshman level, with a note by the teacher saying there are some promising things in this movie to work with, but it has a long way to go before it should ever be nominated for any award much less an Oscar.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I agree,"I don't wish to be mean but seriously, what's all the fuss about??

But this is no masterpiece! The film does have it's moments but does not really go anywhere and at times appears completely lost (no pun intended)!Someone from the NY Times suggested that it's about time Bill Murray got his Oscar recognition for this one coz comedy was a serious affair. And I agree with that statement, albeit partially. If Murray had to receive his Oscar nod for this one then that would be really unfair.And as far as Coppola's nomination goes - I hope they are not serious in considering her a strong contender.

I must say it was interesting the first time, but seemed somewhat long and a little bit confusing.The second time I saw the film, I really enjoyed everything about it more... the ambiance, the amazing chemistry between Johansson and Murray, and the basic story. This is both a hyper-modern and meandering tale, and not everyone's going to ""get"" it, or be able to get past the hype. It truly is not for everyone. I believe those who do enjoy it will really like it a lot... in a way, it's a ""love it or hate it"" sort of picture. Put my squarely in the 'love it' camp.

The reverse 'Gigli?',"Being an ""art-house"" kind of guy, I was really looking forward to this picture, having seen the previews half-a-dozen times and taking in all the stellar reviews. So I was somewhat disappointed to find that when I actually saw the film, I spent a good bit of the time a little, well...bored. I'd give it a thumbs-up over a thumbs-down, certainly, but it wouldn't be an enthusiastic one.The big problem for me was the relationship between the two main characters. It just didn't click the way it should have. The character of Charlotte in particular seemed to me to be a little weakly drawn, and though Scarlett Johansson is definitely appealing, as an actress she doesn't look to me to be capable of turning in an outstanding performance yet. (Addendum: I was quickly disabused of this notion soon after when I saw 'Girl with a Pearl Earring!') Bill Murray's Bob Harris fares a lot better, but admit it, for all the praise he receives he isn't one of our greatest actors either. I found the ""evening out"" scene to be interminable--I knew it would be difficult if not impossible for the film to redeem itself totally after being so discomfited by it.I found Sofia Coppola's script to be far more the bigger problem here than her directing. Besides the characters and the relationship not really jelling for me, I was too often distracted by her minimalist (for lack of a better word) style that frequently cropped up. Too many scenes had scant dialog, music or even background noise for a film that was not profound enough to justify it.Having trashed 'LIT' pretty well, let me point out some of the good things in it, and there are a number. As intimated before, Coppola's direction is very nice in many places. The Japanese locale is not just a convenient exotic backdrop, it's an integral, indispensable part of the film. Her presentation of the country is wonderful. She captures the not only the marvelous sights so well, but also the country's culture, both the pure and the Western hybrid varieties. Oftentimes, to great effect, we see some odd happening going on and it's not explained to us. We stay just as bewildered as the characters, and this works very well indeed. And Murray's humor is made excellent use of also, whether he's tossing of the ""ring-a-ding-ding"" one-liners or, in the movie's funniest scene, trying to get rid of a gift of a Japanese role-playing hooker. Another great moment comes when Bob Harris is flipping channels trying to find something comprehensible on Japanese TV when he comes across his own image with dubbed-in voice--it's actually a clip of Murray from an old 'Saturday Night' show. Nice.It seems to me that this film might be a sort of reverse 'Gigli' for 2003: everyone seems as willing to believe the rave reviews about it as they were to accept unquestioningly all the bad things said about the Affleck/Lopez film. 'Lost in Translation' is an OK movie, certainly more good than bad, but don't feel like you have to act like it's a work of genius just because so many others say it is. You're not alone in your lesser opinion of it.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"I just feel so alone, even when I'm surrounded by other people.","Beautifully shot visuals, captivating performances, and introspective exploration of loneliness and human connection, ""Lost in Translation"" has been praised for its unique and thought-provoking storytelling.One of the standout aspects of ""Lost in Translation"" is the exceptional performances by Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson. Murray portrays Bob Harris, an aging actor who has come to Tokyo to shoot a whiskey commercial, with a nuanced blend of dry humor and subtle melancholy. Johansson plays Charlotte, a young woman who is visiting Tokyo with her husband, but finds herself feeling isolated and disconnected from him. The chemistry between Murray and Johansson is palpable, and their performances bring depth and authenticity to their characters, making their evolving relationship at the center of the film truly compelling.The film's setting in Tokyo is also a major character in itself. Coppola masterfully captures the vibrant and surreal atmosphere of Tokyo, with its neon-lit streets, bustling crowds, and unique cultural quirks. The juxtaposition of the characters' sense of disorientation and alienation in this foreign city adds to the overall theme of feeling lost and disconnected, while also highlighting the beauty and strangeness of the Japanese culture.One of the strengths of ""Lost in Translation"" is its introspective exploration of loneliness and human connection. Bob and Charlotte find solace in each other's company as they navigate their own personal crises. They share moments of genuine connection, whether it's through quiet conversations, shared experiences, or wordless glances, and their relationship is portrayed with tenderness and sensitivity. The film poses questions about the nature of human connection, the challenges of communication, and the search for meaning in life, which resonate deeply with audiences.Another notable aspect of ""Lost in Translation"" is its visual and auditory aesthetics. Coppola's direction and the cinematography by Lance Acord create a dream-like atmosphere, with beautifully composed shots, soft lighting, and a muted color palette, which further enhance the film's themes of isolation and introspection. The film's iconic soundtrack, featuring the ethereal music of Kevin Shields and other indie bands, adds to the overall mood and emotion of the film.However, some viewers may find the film's slow pace and minimalistic plot less engaging. The film is more character-driven than plot-driven, focusing on the internal struggles and emotions of the characters rather than a traditional narrative structure. Some may also find the open-ended conclusion ambiguous and unsatisfying, leaving questions unanswered.In conclusion, ""Lost in Translation"" is a beautifully crafted film that delves into the complexities of human connection and loneliness with grace and sensitivity. Its outstanding performances, captivating visuals, and introspective storytelling make it a standout in contemporary cinema. While its unconventional narrative and slow pace may not be to everyone's taste, for those who appreciate thought-provoking and visually stunning cinema, ""Lost in Translation"" is a must-watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Lost In Pregnancy,"I found this movie a breath of fresh air. So many films nowadays leave nothing up to the imagination, where as Lost In Translation lets you ponder all of the possibilities. I thought the casting was great and cannot wait to see Scarlett Johansson in future films.Although the forum has covered all of the likes and dislikes of this film I was quite surprised that the possibility of Charlotte being pregnant was not discussed. I know, I know let me explain myself here! Well, if you do get an opportunity to watch this film again notice the positioning of her hands in several scenes, she seems to constantly have them comforting/shielding her stomach. She is also overly emotional as most women are when they are pregnant and almost seems to be questioning whether or not her husband will be a good father to her unborn child.I definitely had a number of questions running through my mind when leaving the theater. Several being, Is she on the trip to Tokyo to try and approach the subject with her husband and let him know she is expecting? Does her husband already know? Suggesting she should stop smoking early on in the film. Another possibility though much more taboo would be that she has already decided not to have the child and is therefore not concerned with smoking and drinking. Or could it be that no one knows including herself which would explain her bad habits. Not to mention the baggy clothes throughout the movie. Now before you completely try and discount my theory take the time and watch for yourself and this time pay attention. There is a key conversation between the two leads regarding parenting and how on one hand parenting can be scary while on the other in can be absolutely delightful. Listen to this in depth and notice the placement of her hands.Don't get me wrong the bottom line is that I loved this film although I was not impressed with the editing. It seemed to be very choppy and in some aspects out of sequence, which could be a consequence of studio execs not liking the pregnancy subplot then editing it down to 96 minutes, excluding credits. Would the continuity of this film been more fluid with the pregnancy footage? Well, your guess is as good as mine!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"A tale for outsiders, with a couple hiccups","After all the accolades have been done and gone for a year, I finally got around to watching this film. Suffice to say that I was pleasantly surprised by this mood/character piece by Sofia Coppola First of all, Lost In Translation has a lot more to do with the observational documentary aesthetic and storytelling than the regular fictional narrative that's common to Hollywood film, so if you want it looking for the standard formula for story, that is to say, if you're looking for a typical movie, you're going to be disappointed. This here is less about a traditional story and more about watching two people and developing an understanding of who they are, what they're dealing with and how they make a connection. But we get all this from the watching of them, rather than a clear narrative arc being presented to us (not to say that there isn't a story--but rather, it's a background for the characters).That said, the film does an impressive job exploring how our two characters, lost and self-alienated, cope or fail to cope with their situation. They find each other in a foreign environment and make a connection despite their melancholy and find a means to enjoy their time in Tokyo. I was convinced by the leads' portrayals of their characters and participated in the characters' emotions. I like the floating aspect of the direction and the ease by which the atmosphere is captured is an improvement on Coppola's The Virgin Suicides, and although there are still a couple of less than inspired moments, the capturing of the image coordinated with the acting and setups are still memorable.But, I have to say there were several times that I wanted to throw random objects at the screen because of lack of believability, including some of the ""interacting with silly Japanese"" setups that were fairly hard to believe--the humor is weak because it relies on prejudices that aren't informed. Although I understand the ""looking at it through the eye of someone who doesn't want to, nor cares to understand"" the contrast between very real characters and their empathy and the very unreal, often late-night-weekend-TV sketch comedy pieces leads to disconcerting conflict of tone in the film and has a touch of cultural arrogance.But those moments are not as common as the better moments in the film. Which is good, because I very much liked the rest of the film. Maybe it's because I often feel like an outsider floating around this city of Los Angeles, but I, as the third party, made a connection with these two souls lost in Tokyo. And sometimes finding that connection makes all the difference when you're lost in translation. 8/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I kept waiting for this to get good.  I'm still waiting.,"It's the same old story:  pretty Yale grad just can't handle one week in beautiful Tokyo with her husband so she hooks up with a 55 year old SNL alum and sings karaoke.

A great film from Sofia Coppola,"I once talked to a friend of mine at school about this film. He said in simple terms ""Nothing happens man"". I didn't bother trying to explain to him the significance of a film like this, and the point was not intriguing plot lines or a complex story, and that the impressive part about this film is its simplicity. But i just thought these things to myself, anyhow, i haven't seen any other film from Sofia Coppola, but from what i hear about virgin suicides and marie antoinette, i think Lost In Translation is her gem. I didn't think i would like a film like this, and i wasn't exactly obsessed with it like many people (film buffs) i know are, however i can't deny that its a great film. Murray and jOhansson are great, and Coppola's directorial hand is very good. I loved the score from Kevin Shields and cinematography from Lance Acord. It was very good atmospheric film and did well to show how two people can show affection without necessarily being intimate. ---- IMDb Rating: 7.9, my rating: 9/10",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Strangely atmospheric drama masterpiece,"In my review of Casablanca I pondered that does a drama always have to have never-ending talking going on all the time. Well, here's the answer. Lost in Translation is a drama for my taste. It has a lot of quiet, slow, atmospheric moments, and still the story keeps on going perfectly.So, why is the movie so good? Well, I just can't pinpoint anything wrong with it. The acting is great (Bill Murray is always my favorite) and the directing is beautiful. I'm kind of happy that Sofia Coppola can direct a film this good and prove that she is a notable director even if his father's godlike legacy is enough to overshadow anyone.Overall, it's one of those mysteriously magical films that I just love every time I watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Watched it because of Bill Murray.,"I decided to watch this movie because of Bill Murray , one of my favorite actors ever for his amazing movies like Ghostbusters II , Groundhog Day , Fantastic Mr fox and much more.The movie explored themes of relationship and commitment and self deprivation amongst people you see , now the movie has a simple story but I didn't really quite get how good is it I didn't get confused but I was really wondering what is this movie's goal? That I do not know but one thing for Certain is that this movie is written and directed by Sofia Coppola the daughter of the legend who directed the godfather (Francis Ford Coppola) and this movie also had Scarlett Johansson she did a great performance in this film.Overall great film bill Murray as always did a fantastic job in here

Beautiful and believable.  Don't think twice.,"I saw this movie today for the first time. I don't like seeing films when they first come out as they usually come wrapped in hype and (in this occasion) public opinion that demands YOU SEE THIS FILM.The whole impression of this film is that it is greater than the sum of its parts. I felt at times that I was watching different films from different time periods. Mainly the early to late 70s when Ms Coppolas father was at his zenith.For instance some of the ""slapstick"" sequences featuring Murray could have come from a Woody Allen picture circa 1973.French Cinema appears to be an influence. I would urge anyone who has seen this to watch the 1980s film Subway with Christophe Lambert.The beautiful and almost claustrophobic detail of Tokyo is beautifully outlined by Coppolla with many different styles of shots including steadi-cam that keep the whole film fresh and moving.You feel that you could almost read the minds of the people and the plot. Again a feature of French Cinema. The people are far more important than the slim plot.It is entirely believable and this type of complicated and touching relationship is not dealt with too often in Cinema because it is complicated, deep and difficult to convey unless you have been there. I was able to work out exactly what would happen and when as if I had been there before.Heck this is great film, great soundtrack, great location. They really don't make them like this anymore.The best way to rate a film in my opinion is to watch it and see how quickly it goes. If it feels like five minutes as it did for this film you have a winner.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Disconnected characters struggle to connect,"This movie follows two Americans who feel lost in the shuffle of Japan, disconnected from others and lost in the culture. Yet, even as they supposedly bond, I never truly felt a connection between them. Still, I kind of liked it.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
They'll always have Toyko!,"I hate it when they call a film like this a ""Comedy"" because that's misleading. Not to say there aren't funny moments. Bill Murray is always good at making awkward situations funny, but he is mostly playing it straight here. That's why so many people who are expecting a laugh out loud film will be very disappointed with ""Lost In Translation"".This is a film about two people who are not connecting with their spouses. They may have before but some how they have drifted away from each other. Now away in a foreign country these two meet and feel like they actually ""get each other"". Bill Murray plays a has been film star getting a chance to make a lot of money by making a Japanese whiskey commercial. His humor comes from the way he tries to understand and deal with the Japanese. Scarlett Johansson plays a former ivy league grad who doesn't know what to do with her life, other than being a wife to a entertainment photographer(Giovanni Ribisi). We see her move through Tokyo watching the Japanese live their daily life. She's amused by it all but it's still all alien to her. Bill is alone at his hotel and Scarlett's husband is off shooting pictures so she is alone as well. Both unable to sleep meet at the hotel bar and hit it off.The thing I love about this film is that it does NOT follow the typical road that most stories like this would. There is no sex, just slight touches and glances. Even though he's old enough to be her father and she his daughter, they don't see each other like that. They connect on a different level, the mind, for which age means nothing. The movie ended not as I thought or hoped, but as it should have. They shared something meaningful and even though it wasn't long lasting, these moments shared will last them a lifetime. I am also VERY glad that the director/writer(Sofia Coppola) chose not to let us hear the final words of the film that were uttered by Murray into Johansson's ear. We just see her nodding, saying okay, and that final sweet kiss. This lets US imagine what he would have said to her before he went back to the states and his wife.I have always loved Bill Murray. Sofia Coppola wrote this film with him in mind and he does a brilliant job. This film made me fall in love with Scarlett Johansson. I liked her in ""Ghost World"" but now I can't wait to see ""The Girl with One Pearl Earring"". I must also mention the cinematography is fantastic. The sites and sounds of Tokyo were both breathtaking and overwelming. I'm sure it was done that way to give you an idea of what the characters were feeling about what was around them. Thank you Sofia for a truly wonderful original film.PS: Anna Faris who plays the dumb blonde ""action"" star is great. If you get the DVD, watch her extended interview session.

Why does this Movie get a High Rating?,"Having recently seen this movie, I had to ask myself how this movie manages to get a high rating on IMDB. I also have to wonder at times when reading these reviews whether we've all been to see the same film. It has it's funny moments but the story line ambles along at a very slow pace. For most of the film you are kept wondering whether the two characters, an aging actor (Bill Murray) and a very young bored girl, stuck in a Hotel, will end up in bed together. The answer is no. How this movie can ever win an award I'll never know.",,Anonymous,Comedy
How to comment on perfection?!,"The moment the movie opened I was captivated beyond belief.  Tokyo spreads out and fills the screen, accompanied by such haunting music that I was placed slap-bang in the middle of Bob Harris' mind, joining him in his feeling of desolation and ennui.  Though Tokyo's electric city is a common view Sofia Coppola manages to instil an almost immediate impression of weariness - the camera not only shows us Bob Harris' view, but it has become his eyes, and we (de rigueur) voyeurs are suddenly allowed a glimpse not only of who this character is, but who he was and who he has become.  As soon as Bill Murray's world-weary face comes into view, those who have not already grasped the complexities of Bob Harris' character do so now with this first glimpse.  The car pulls into a tall, grey hotel and Bob is surrounded by Japanese concierges, attempting to pull him every way and pressing packages into each available nook.  However, Sofia Coppola chose well in Bob Harris' image-maker, giving Bill Murray the starring role he truly deserves.  He remains the hypnotic eye-of-the-storm, his face never changing from its bleak and tired crinkle, even as the dervishes spin around him.  This first introduction to Bob Harris permeates the whole movie and his whole character - Bob Harris is every job you ever felt was beneath you, every trip you wish you'd stayed at home, every relationship you can't understand how you got in to, and every day that feels like the long, dark Sunday-afternoon of the soul.'The Virgin Suicides' looked great and, for all its faults, was a good story, but if the ultimate aim was connection, then it failed.  'Lost.' does not fail, which is why the main factor for me will always be the satiated feeling I got from watching it.  I left the theatre smiling, and so many trimmings combined to give this to me that the result as a whole is as near to perfection as I've seen in a long time.  Sofia Coppola is rapidly maturing into a fine filmmaker and a sterling writer.  The direction is flawless and, as Ms. Coppola is wont to do, the music perfectly matches the camera flow and character movement.  From its haunting introduction of Tokyo to the ebbing and flowing of the obligatory karaoke scene, the camera and score are so in tune with each other that they appear as one.  'Air' and Sofia Coppola gave a sense of fantasy and wonderment in 'The Virgin Suicides', but here she takes it all a leap further, where the original music sounds so much the better for having being written specifically.Scarlett Johansson is a revelation in the making.  Though not proud, in her own words, of the character she played in 'Ghost World', that is exactly where she first came to my attention, outstripping the wonderful Thora Birch and proving herself worthy of notice.  Again in 'The Man who Wasn't There' she shone, and I am purposely ignoring Scarlett's earlier performances in 'The Horse Whisperer', etc, as I am now dealing with Scarlett Johansson the adult.  She interacts perfectly with the young Giovanni Ribisi (unobtrusively great - he stays in the background as much as his character, rumoured to be based on the erstwhile husband of the Director, Spike Jonze), and transfers this pleasant skill onto the older character of Bob.  This movie shows Johansson at her obstinate, spoilt, aloof, lonely, lost best - allowing her to fill out Charlotte as she chooses with smiles and gazes and body movements so simple you almost miss the glimpses of inner-character she is offering you.However, this is undeniably Bill Murray's film.  Every scene, every moment, he fills with this character and forces you to take stock of his loneliness and unbearable ache of being.  Sympathy goes one step further and the viewer is forced to feel and be Bob Harris, drowning in the pain of existence and willing him to do anything to change it.  That is why, when a girl smiles at him in an elevator, his face instantly lights up and we begin to feel the warmth enter us as it has entered Bob.  Coppola's strength is her simplicity, and moments that stand out for me are the tableau of the two strangers and soul mates lying on a bed, she curled up and he straight as a board, his hand resting lightly on her bare foot.  The moment screams with emotion, but represses it until the final departing, where both characters reveal their underlying fears.  Another scene finds the two seated in a hallway, Bob in uncharacteristically 'hip' t-shirt and Charlotte in a platinum wig, finally succumbing to who they really are.  Not the singer in a karaoke or the drinking woman, but two lost and lonely souls who just need to sit down for a while.Take-on-take, this movie offers one of the most stunningly inventive and intuitive glimpses at human nature and its resistance of fate that I have seen - a stunning portrayal of friendship forged of desperation and the recognition of a kindred spirit. If this film is about anything, it is about two people about to go under, grabbing at the only life preserver they can see - each other.  The writing, though perfectly good, covers a quarter of how the feeling comes across in this movie.  The direction and acting extend this beyond mediocrity to excellence, the actors especially allowing the many quiet moments of reflection to speak for themselves.  Silence is strength itself, and more is shown through the character interaction and facial tweaks than a thousand words could manage.  True life depiction at its finest, and that rarest of creatures - a movie to be truly proud of.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Art of subtle acting.....,"I resisted watching this movie for the longest time. I really wasn't interested in it quite frankly. But over time, finally just gave in the other night when it showed up on TMC. I was totally blown away. Bill Murray has turned into one hell of an actor. The movie is an example of subtle film making at its best. There is really nothing exciting to keep you into the movie. What keeps you into the movie is the performances of Murray and Johansson. Watching these two Americans in Japan, neither doing what they want to be doing but powerless it would seem to change that. Both are not totally happy in their current relationships. These two factors bring them together, an unlikely pair, but given their circumstances, the relationship makes perfect sense.I am glad that I finally gave in and gave this movie a chance. After seeing some dismal movies lately, was nice to watch something that lived up to the hype I had heard.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Surprisingly different, you will not regret watching","Bill Murray the way most of the female audience would have appreciated in his past performances; Scarlett Johansson is subdued and believable, as she faces the fact that her marriage to fashion photographer (Giovanni Ribisi) is less than perfect.Add to the mix, Bill Murray, as a celebrity in Tokyo, tired of his American success; You have an excellent non-pretentious movie (unusual, these days), wherein these two characters simply get to know each other, hang out, and (the audience hopes) eventually get together.Sophia Coppola is to be praised; as are the principal actors; this film gives credit to the audience for having a brain, has suspense, beautiful photography, and no trite endings.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Hate it or love it. I love it.,"Good for you Sophia, for every person who doesn't appreciate this film I hope there are at least five other people who do. In fact I just went back to read comments and it does seem 5:1. I hope so.Every person expressing disappointment with this film say the same things, ""the storyline is pointless"" or ""the actors are boring snobs"". Get over your preconceived notions of what a movie should be and if you don't like it then so be it. So what if there is no point obvious explicit point to the storyline. Boring? That's too bad you find it boring.What I love about the film is how beautiful it is. Not just the shots (which are just incredibly gorgeous) and not just the music (which is simply perfect). More than that, it shows the beauty of a city and of a simple relationship between a man and a girl becoming a woman. The story is simple, not many words are spoken but those that are spoken are sincere. The movie, to me, is about how the beauty of life sneaks up on you when your not looking. It is about sincerity, true moments where people are just looking for something special like friendship. In this case, it's an unlikely friendship in an unlikely place.There is not much happening and not terribly much being said, but really this film speaks incredibly loudly to me. I love it.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
no preference,"I would say this movie is very real emotionally. The relationship between the main characters is very true and natural, it really reflects something. The barrier of doesnt understand Japanese was a bit extravagant tho. I mean I don't really think that real Japanese could lack of the ability to read people's emotion to that level. But I could understand that this is a metaphor to emphasize the kind of outsider situation of the main characters. It is not a big deal since the main philosophy and whole vibe is accurate. The good of the movie is that it really creates a sense of everyday life and catch the tiny moments. There are many movies whose every second is dramatic and a little bit out of reality. While watching this movie, it makes me feel like meditation at some point. And I have to say that scarlet she's a real beauty.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"For people with a soul, not smart people","OK, I gave it a 10. I spent a lot of time in Japan as a gaijin. I loved the soundtrack, which contains a few rarities that I just happen to love. So, if you've never spent time alone in Japan, you might say its only a 9. If you've never spent time alone in any place as foreign as Japan, give it a 8. If the music isn't for you, give it a 7.But, to put it down sarcastically as a movie for only ""smart people"" is foolish. It is a movie for people with a soul. If you don't get it, you need to find a soul. What happens? Lots of things happen, and they do so without F/X or CGI. Imagine that. What is it about? Get a soul, then ask. One hint; when you find yourself alone in a very foreign place, say like Little Rock, in a place when everyone has preconceived notions about you, good & bad, just because of how you look, that really helps you figure out who you really are.I do agree with the criticism of the female lead as more whiny spoiled brat than neglected wife.

Melancholy of Loneliness and Existentialism,"I waited long enough for the right mood to watch this film, because from its description I expected what awaits me, and I wasn't mistaken. I think it is not for spontaneous viewing, otherwise you will perceive the film differently. The film as a whole does not look like something special from the higher category of cinema, a bit smacks of art house because of the unusual narration, editing, and style of filmmaking typical of independent cinema.The movie is light and casual, it immerses you in its atmosphere and in the movie itself. The plot is simple, but you can dig into it. The comedy won't make you laugh, but a grin will appear.It's very hard to say specifically what you didn't like. It dragged a bit in some places, but in other places it was justified.It feels like the film, to some extent, has no goal of what experience to convey to the viewer, as he determines it for himself, and more from a philosophical point of view.

The landscape and photography is amazing... yet not appealing in the communication areas....I guess we are all lost in translation. When these two characters connect.....the chemistry works well.

The cinematic equivalent of The Emperor's New Clothes,"Imagine hearing the major critics on the top of the roof on the skycraper sing boisterous praise for one of the five hundred 'qualified masterpieces', and Lost in Translation somehow received the honor bestowed on Sofia Coppola and company. Big mistake.Lost in Translation is one of these movies that at first you might be seeing a terrific movie, but as it progress it become drab, droll and tedious without justification in substance. There's really no story to speak of -- only paper-thin basic with inanely banterous dialogue.There may be a merit in cinematography that raise the artistic value of this movie, but because the story is non-existent and the characters utterly unsympathetic & boring to watch, cinematography -- stationary in some scenes and moving in others -- somehow negate the enjoyability of the movie by focusing on the ludicrous aspect of tedium as if Sofia could bring back the element of silence inspired by silent films of the early 20th century.Lost in Translation (er, Sofia) abuse the silence element as the expression of meaning when it really add *nothing* of substance to the aesthetics of the movie, artistic or otherwise. It's utterly meaningless if one does not understand the express purpose of silence at the right moment to convey the humanistic value of life in the hectic and modern world. Sofia is being altruistic to the detriment of the audience when it comes to the vanity of the characters as portrayed Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson which generated zero empathy that makes the movie even less interesting to watch in a continuous manner without becoming fidgety or letting out relaxing yawn. There's nothing of interest what happen to the main characters and why should the audience give a care.Sofia made the blunders in filming and keeping the scenes from the fate of being tossed into the cutting room trash bin that are particularly unintentionally humorous in being unabashedly pretentious or idiotically embarrassing. Like the English pronunciation-mangling Japanese hooker in the hotel room and the pointless, unromantic conversations with Bill & Scarlett characters who somehow fall in love while possessing ice-cold personalities that would make Mr. Freeze blush in humbled shame. And the movie moves in the glacial pace that makes it atrocious to watch -- it is the cinematic exercise in tedium for the sake of artistic expression, without tightening up. It drags on and on until the audience feel nothing but contempt for the characters and especially the screenwriter/director responsible for torture by mean of boring the audience to death.Sofia once mentioned her favorite movie director is Terrence Malick. Mr. Malick is a completely different filmmaker who knows how to convey the meaning of silence in the poetic setting because Malick has experience observing nature and human qualities as a former philosophy professor & translator. Sofia did not because she doesn't get the aesthetics combined with silence without the backbone of a rich story and characterization. The Virgin Suicides, Sofia's debut movie, is well-made and competent, but Lost in Translation is such a trainwreck in terms of lackluster substance & poor, drag-on editing that lend to experiencing boredom. This boredom probably reflect the period of boredom at certain points of her life, and she parlay that experience as a form of torture to inflict the mental anguish of tedium on the audience in vengeance.Scarlett Johannson and Bill Murrey, while accomplished movie actors in their right, do the barest minimum except mug to the camera in the aura of exulting ""Sundance Film Festival"" self-importance that elevate this movie to the new level (more like bottom 100) in high art, with moronically sedate monotony & meandering tedium thrown in. Bill's acting is nothing special save comedy and Scarlett is moderately competent but technically bad in dramatic acting (which makes it a safe bet she'll never be nominated for Best Actress Oscar in her lifetime, UK's BAFTA Best Actress award clinch for subpar, vacant, minimalist acting style partially blamed on Sofia's tepid, fumbling directional style & a future hard-*** director demanding spectacular acting notwithstanding).Frankly, I do not know how Lost in Translation screenplay appealed to Scarlett and Bill Murray. It may be a character study, but does it delve into humanities, psychology and philosophy? No. It's more like a staid travelogue populated with non-descript characters that say absolutely nothing but dumb banter then fade to the pretty backdrop with the main characters wandering for a few minutes too long. This script won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for nothing but silence, banter, silence, banter, silence, inaudible whisper, fade to end? When the critics claim the movie have substance that the audience could not spot and decipher and call us stupid for being oblivious, I say the true design of Lost in Translation is that it is an introvertible proof The Emperor's New Clothes carry a valid allegory that apply to Sofia's vapid, utterly worthless filmflam that, next to Corey Haim's 1989 video diary ""Me, Myself & I"", might serve as an ideal audio-visual torture device. Because Sofia wants the audience to experience what she endured, and so we the viewers get the taste of her bitter medicine of a puerile existence, similar to what Vincent Gallo did with the cheerfully self-indulgent ""Buffalo 66"".Zero star out of four",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
'Presence',"S.J. drifts from set to set unsure what to do with herself (or rather, the crew not sure what to do with her) and so was set up with numerous 'strangers' who also knows that, contrary to Dorothy, nowhere is home: not being missed makes you unselfish, being written allover with no sense of attachment makes you a survivor, having some moral ground makes you a loser(?) waiting to be tripped-up, but if you do not tolerate this, your children (if you can convince anyone to have any) is still going to be next by the sheer social force of 'wisening up the kids so they do not get picked on'. Thereby completely sterilising all encounters into roam-antic friendships for the sake of comfort and good hospitality (and why be the cause of any suffering when the medical bill is to be borne by children?).",,Anonymous,Comedy
Why wise introverts will like it,"This film shares an a ""lonelyness in a mertopolis"" atmosphere. Both of the main charachters are looming like they are lonely philosophers in their deepressing reality. Every one of them is lonely inside while outside he is crowded by people. It gives them an a phylosophycal identity which I find very relatable. ""Everyone wants to be found"": what a great demonstration of the main idia of the film. The movie shows how simillar may different people be. I consider that is such an actual idia. Moreover, I really like the way the movie revolving around it. In addition to all I have said, the directing, the locations, the atmoshpere of this picture are magnificent. And Bill Murray in a pair with Scarlett Johansson, have an amaizing chemistry between them, which is building all the film. I have really enjoyed watching this masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
This movie really got me hypnotized,"Having read many of the posts dealing with Lost in translation, I can't understand why anyone would go through fire just to make a point about character-flaws or similar. How anyone could hate this movie so bad, I don't know. But to me it is a GREAT movie, if not the greatest. The story really left me hypnotized. It is a beautiful story of all the small things in life, and the importance of such moments.I couldn't care less whether someone thinks that Johanssons character couldn't be as ""confused"" since she had attended to a philosophy-class. Of coarse she could. Of coarse this story could have happened.Great story, great actors, great props. If you're only gonna see one movie, ever, let this be the one. I feel obligated to mention that if you are an action-flick-fan, and the only thing racing through your mind is movement/action/less-speaking, you should avoid this film at all costs.

Beautiful! A movie that anyone who lives in foreign country will understand completely.,"I'd heard all about it, read about, it but somehow 'the synopsis' and the cover image of Bill Murry sat in his dressing-gown put me off for a while. Anyway, I finally saw it the other day and was really captivated by the emotional depth that this film conveys. The characters, both so different, are displayed in their stark isolation against the ultra modern, exotic, but alien canvas of urban japan. I found myself analising both of them closely. The need to maintain a front of control and geniality despite the emptiness all around. Their attraction - human rather than sexual (but we all sense it!) - is problematised by their ages and personal backgrounds... I, as a male can already empathise with Murry's character and am sure I will more and more as I get older. I'm sure the same is true from a female point of view. It is also (strangely, I suppose) an escapist movie because you can't help experiencing events totally through the eyes of the characters.. The music was perfect, the lighting, the lonely but amiable comfort of a whiskey in a piano bar in a skyscraper at 4am somewhere on the other side of the world....One of the best movies I've seen in ages!",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Pleasant and very well-acted.,"Lost in Translation is not a film looking to dazzle its audience with special effects or make them burst out laughing at anything. This is a simple film about two strangers who meet in a Tokyo hotel and share some quality time with each other while trying to figure some things out. Bill Murray has never been better, and Scarlet Johansson more than holds her own opposite the legendary actor/comedian.Murray plays Bob Harris, a washed-up actor now relegated to doing whiskey commercials and photo shoots in Japan for his income. The film begins with him checking into a posh hotel and being enthusiastically greeted by a gang of hotel employees. After checking in, Bob is left with the predicament of having to find something to do in a strange place when he cannot fall asleep. He looks so helpless in the shot where he's just sitting on the bed staring back at the camera. Also staying in the hotel is a young woman named Charlotte (Johansson). She is with her photographer husband who is in town for a shoot. Even when they are next to each other, he barely pays her any attention. After a couple of days, Bob and Charlotte find themselves sitting at the hotel bar together and both feeling pretty lonely.The relationship that develops between them is deep and thoughtful. Both characters need one another while lost in this strange land. We see them going out to clubs, hanging out with some locals, and having dinner. The whole time we see them growing closer and closer. Thankfully the relationship never becomes sexual, or it would be harder to like these characters. They share an awkward kiss or two in an elevator, and a longer one in their final scenes together, but the relationship is more memorable for what they say to each other. They have one particularly moving conversation about children while lying in bed. Bob is able to shed some wisdom about something Charlotte has likely never given that much thought to before.At one point, Bob sleeps with the hotel lounge singer. He is a married man, but it isn't really clear who he feels the most guilty for. His wife or Charlotte. He is clearly embarrassed when Charlotte catches them together and his phone conversations back home seem less than cheerful. You get the sense that he'd much rather have Charlotte in his bed than the lounge singer.When it's time for Bob to go, he doesn't want leave. He knows he will miss Charlotte terribly and will most likely never see her again. A hot blonde hits on him in the lobby and he hardly notices. All he can do is watch Charlotte as the elevator doors close on her. Somehow as his cab is driving away, he sees her again on the street and he orders the cab to stop. Bob then tracks her down again and the two share a private moment together in the middle on hundreds of people. It's private because we cannot hear what he says in her ear, and we probably have no business knowing in the first place. It's just two interesting characters having a moment to themselves. By then you'll likely feel they've earned it.The film is beautifully shot and modestly paced, to say the least. Coppola has some genuine skill behind the camera, and she will likely have a long and successful career. The film is rated R, but take out a brief scene at a strip club and it barely qualifies for PG-13. With all the accolades this film received, it was bound to attract quite a bit of criticism, also. The best way to enjoy this film is to forget about all the awards and nominations and just take it for what it is. A simple, pleasant story of two people who happen to meet in a strange place far from home.8 of 10 stars.The Hound.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Loved the comedy!,"What a great and moving flic.Loved the subtle comedy. For eg. when stares down her hubbie's ""girlfriend"" the annoying actress, or when the ""lady of the night"" asks Mr Harris to ""Lip my stocking"" and then the theatre afterwards. :) I sit down every now and again when I'm not feeling the greatest, rewatch the movie, and all is better.I think the movie also went a ways to explaining depression and how people can get a bit over it all, only to have some of those nights like the karaoke and associated run around Charlotte and Mr Harris had.I really was rolling around on the couch laughing soooo hard at times during the film.Classic movie and definitely one of the few on my regular rewatch list.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Privileged Melancholy,"Endearing depiction of melancholic story-telling, but couldn't quite shake the underlying autobiographical quality of its writer-director commodifying the tiresome woes of a privileged life. Profoundly punctuated by her father's name prominently displayed under executive producer as the credits roll.It's beauty and downfall both lie in the fact that there are no true villains present, nor are there any heroes. At the end of the day life goes on and it becomes an intimate decision to smile over succumbing to a nihilistic viewpoint.Brilliantly acted, it serves as a masterclass on illustrating the mundane with authentic charm. However, it's ordinariness seems reaching from a filmmakers standpoint; as though a voyeuristic study of what celebrities think the average person desires which could only be displayed through the juxtaposition of a fictional celebrity's experience. An undeserved and under-explored take on ""celebrities, they're just like us.""",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Recipe for success: cast Bill Murray,"I'm probably wrong, but honestly I can only think of one reason that critics and the movie industry seemed to love this tedious, contrived, and artlessly racist movie: Bill Murray.Here's the basis of my theory (please forgive the name-dropping, it's required to make my point): Celebrities are often spotted in New York. I've bumped into Harrison Ford on Madison Avenue, dined near Nicole Kidman , seen Uma Thurman browse jazz records and (separately) Ethan Hawke knock back neat whiskeys, etc. But in thirty years, only once have I ever seen a celebrity actually cause a stir--and not among the general public, but among waiters at a very upscale restaurant, where celebrities are commonplace.It was Bill Murray. While waiting for a friend, I happened to occupy a barstool that was near both the waiters' station and Murray's booth. The waiters were actually arguing over which of them got to fill his water glass next. They were neglecting other patrons. They were whispering and giggling. They were thrilled.The point is: Everybody likes Bill Murray. He's no Laurence Olivier, and he's made some real clinkers (Zissou, Where the Buffalo Roam, Quick Change, Charlie's Angels, Get Smart), but he seems to float above them, a cynical, comical everyman that nobody hates.If his ""Lost in Translation"" character had been played by, say, Kurt Russell or Michael Keaton or Jeff Bridges (they're about the same age, and all have comic/dramatic range)-- I suspect critics would have treated ""Lost in Translation"" the way they treated, say, ""3000 Miles to Graceland"" or ""Jack Frost"" or ""Nadine."" In other words, they would have had the courage to say, This film is atrocious.The moral: If you've got a dull, callow screenplay and a name like Coppola that'll get you funding, hire Bill Murray.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy

take the time to relax yourself a little with this little pearl,"In 1999 Sofia Coppola made a breakthrough in the landscape of North-American cinema with ""the Virgin Suicides"" in which she walled up 5 lovely female teenagers in silence due to their severe parents and notably their mother. 4 years later, Francis Ford's daughter moves to Tokyo in Japan but keeps the theme of loneliness to give it to her two lost main characters as a means to assess their lives.So, Tokyo constitutes the backdrop for this bitter story. It's a city brimming with lights and people and from a Western standpoint, one often imagines the image of an uptight city. Sofia Coppola rather showcases us a laid-back, carefree vision in which the modernism of the city symbolized by a highly advanced technology and tall buildings is next to a preservation of old traditions and customs. Japan has a strong power of fascination on Western society and I've heard several times some of my peers that they would love to go there. If their dreams come true one day, it is highly likely that they will feel puzzled on the first days of their stay, just like Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson). The former is a prestigious, seasoned actor who came to Tokyo to pocket a few millions of dollars for a whiskey brand while the latter is a fresh philosophy graduate from Yale who hurriedly married a young photographer. Both are somewhat jettisoned by their native close relatives. Both wind up in a four-star hotel amid a country with a culture and a language they don't understand and both are sleepless due to jet lag and in prey to a deep inner turmoil. Nothing at first lets suggest the success of this May-to-December relation but each of them found a soul mate to provide them solace and relief. Charlotte doesn't know what to do with her life but perceives Bob as a solid rock while Bob who is at wits' end considers Charlotte as a reminder of his youth.From the arrival of the two heroes in the chic hotel to their first moments together to their exploration of the city through the mob, colorful places and with their mutual support, Sofia Coppola reused a formula which proved its worth in her precedent work and here it shines again to give astounding results. Everything in her directing breathes delicacy, fragility and she favors a low-key cinematographic language. So it entails a sort of complicity with her two leads. A good pack of her sequences rings thoroughly true like for example when Charlotte rings her mother to tell her her first day in Tokyo. Then, the fax and the telephone are the sole means of communication with their native country for her two heroes and lets the audience suggest the state of their own relationships, especially with Bob whose private life and particularly his marriage goes unravel. Looks, gestures have a big intensity while the suggested has a meaty part in the dialogs. To make the dish more appealing, the female filmmaker had also recourse to a discreet humor like when Bob tries to follow the Japanese director's instructions through the interpreter. Sofia Coppola was right not to steer her film towards a well-worn master plan which would have seen the two characters almost at once in each other's arms. Actually, I must admit that I didn't think of this perspective during the major part of the film. It's much more novel to see two human beings finding their bearings in the throes of a whirlpool shrouding a noisy city and a seemingly indecipherable culture that they timidly tame.The evocative original soundtrack is in perfect adequacy with the images and was discerningly chosen. The lyrics of ""More Than This"" by Roxy Music could apply to Bob (you have to see his performance on a karaoke) and Charlotte. Specialists of noise such as ""My Bloody Valentine"" and ""the Jesus and Mary Chain"" are a perfect musical illustration of the urban chaos in which the two characters happily wrestle.This is also Bill Murray's most ground-breaking role since ""Groundhog Day"" (1993). Like in this ingenious comedy, he acts a cynical man who eventually transmits joy and happiness to the ones he meets. Here his deadpan humor and his sense of restraint could justify the screening of the film. Beside him, Scarlett Johansson epitomizes grace and fragility. This trip to Tokyo was bracing for them and also for the viewer. This prizewinning indie remains etched on his or her memory and this is one to ponder.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Where the Hollywood is going to?,"This is pretty fair movie, Sofia Coppola is young promising filmmaker, good acting, etc etc. But, this movie brings absolutely nothing new to cinematography. Everything it's saying has been already said many times. Take 3 Woody Allen's movies, cut them in pieces, glue together and you get Lost in Translation. A man in middle age crisis has already solved all his dilemmas regarding younger woman in ""Manhattan"". They have already been lost in strange country in ""Everyone Says I Love You"".Besides, all other characters except the two leading ones are linear and totally made up. All Japanese characters are clichéd, I've never been there, but I really doubt that people there are really like that.I mean, the movie is OK but Hollywood should stop and think for a minute where it has come to is when this is one of the best movies of 2003.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
When Bill Met Scarlett...,"This review has been seriously edited to remain within IMDb's word limit. Please refer to wiredonmovies.com for complete, and much better, review.""I just don't know what I'm supposed to be."" ""You'll figure that out. The more you know who you are, and what you want, the less things upset you.""Dialogue from ""Lost in Translation""When you're young you think you know what you want to be. When you're out of college you suddenly realize that what you wanted to be was an unrealistic fantasy. Then, when you're old and frail, you look back upon your life and see that you wasted everything with worry and ended up becoming something you never wanted to be. You could have been what you wanted to be all along--you were just too scared and naive to realize it. In a way, you were at your smartest when you were young, even though you thought it was the exact opposite when you were older. And now that you're really old, you realize that you're also a lonely old person who wasted their life.I imagine that 50-something Bob Harris looked at 20-something Charlotte and saw a bit of himself in this woman. Their relationship wasn't so much physical as it was subtle and romantic. Their conversation about the future and what it holds is one of the fine points of American cinema. The people who say, ""He's too old for her!"" miss the point. Love knows no bounds. But they're not just feeling love anyway--they identify with each other, something they don't with their current spouses. (""I don't know who I married!"" says Charlotte. She isn't married to Bob Harris but she knows him more than her own husband by the end of the film.)Indeed, the film's true points are lost on many viewers who see it is a film bashing Japan, or a boring character piece, or a stupid metaphor for some larger picture that audiences don't care about. They should. Because a lot of true things about life are in ""Lost in Translation."" The title implies more than it seems to after an initial glance.Sure, it has to do with an older man falling in love with a younger woman, but there relationship is never Hollywoodized. They both know there's a boundary they fear to pass. Look how they stare at each other with hesitation at the closing of each meeting. They want to express their true feelings, but marriage and age are both holding them back.Harris is played by Bill Murray. He's a frustrated, lonely, sad, droopy, middle-aged, washed-out actor visiting Tokyo to promote a brand of Japanese whisky. (""You know Rat Pack?"" his Japanese director asks him. ""Oh, yeah, sure. A ring-a-ding-ding."")Charlotte is played by Scarlett Johansson. She's a young lady who is visiting Tokyo with her husband John (Giovanni Ribisi), who is a photographer and leaves her in a fancy hotel for a few days when he must leave for a photo shoot session.What essentially follows is an unconventional love story in the vein of ""Harold and Maude,"" only more realistic. The two main characters soon find themselves falling for each other, although not at all in the way that you are undoubtedly imagining after reading that sentence. No, the two people in this film--and I call them people because they are more than just characters to any person watching the movie--are too real to fall into the clichéd Hollywood love story rut, where there's a lot of romantic discussion and some passionate interludes. Without spoiling much at all, neither of these characters sleeps with each other. We don't know if they're going to sometimes, but to see such a refreshingly original and realistic love story--where the two people don't fall into a bed caressing each other minutes after meeting--is exciting. It's as if we've returned to the core of all romance films. Finally, no more stupid Hugh Grant rubbish--here's a real love story. Tender, intriguing, interesting, and realistic, powered by two alarmingly convincing performances. (Murray is somewhat himself in this movie, but also adds some more sadness to his character; Johansson, really a 19-year-old actress, is amazingly mature and acceptable.)Many of the characters from ""Lost in Translation"" are supposedly based on true people. For example, Charlotte's husband, John, is based on Sofia Coppola's ex-husband, Spike Jonze (director of ""Being John Malkovich""), who directed Cameron Diaz in that film and, according to her fans, had an affair (somehow I doubt it, but...you never know). Kelly, the ditzy blonde movie star, is allegedly based on Diaz--which has not been confirmed, of course, but just reported in interviews and from fans who ""overheard her talking."" Hmm....We'll never know for sure, but the caricatures are seemingly blatant enough. No translation is needed to separate the facts from fiction.Whether or not Sofia Coppola is just trying to tell a mass audience that she was an abandoned wife is up to speculation. Some may cringe at the way she so blatantly molds her characters after real people. But whatever her purpose was with ""Lost in Translation,"" she has certainly succeeded, creating the best film of the year--more touching than any installment of ""The Lord of the Rings,"" more dramatic than ""Big Fish,"" and funnier than a lot of the crude comedies you're likely to find out there. Here's a movie that refreshes the audience in a way that makes them unsure of what they're feeling. The climax is a sort of loose end, as if Coppola is letting the audience translate what is going to happen to these two characters for themselves. Each to his or her own, I suppose. Either way, we're not supposed to undoubtedly know what is going to happen. And for me, that is quite brilliant.5/5 starsJohn Ulmer",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Do reactions need to be so black and white?,"I have read a lot of the comments since at last catching up with the movie this week. Audience reactions seem to be polarised between those who love it and those that found it boring. I have neither of those reactions.On the whole I enjoyed watching it. I have no problem with movies which take their time and each scene had something to like; whether it was cinematography, acting or situation.But I did not love it. I was not left with a feeling of satisfaction at the end because the characters did not go on a journey which I could appreciate. I suppose the question is: do we want movies to reflect life or to tell a story. Most of the time when I am in the cinema, I want to be told a story even if the plot or resolution are somewhat unrealistic. There is enough real life out there for us all to experience. I am not asking for a conventional romantic drama but as least some conflict or temptation.I would contrast this with another Scarlett Johanssen film, Girl with a Pearl Earring, which I enjoyed much more. This also was a slow burn of a film, but there was an outcome of sorts (the picture) and there was more love shown for the setting. Here Tokyo is caricatured and the lack of script seemed to distance us from the characters.I don't think watching this was anything like waste of time and Copolla has talent to spare, but I wonder if I shall ever feel moved to see it again.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Realism doesn't entertain,"When I first saw this film, I connected with Bill Murray's character, which isn't a good thing. The main characters are disenchanted with life, and watching their boredom made me feel even worse about my own boredom. Having lived in Japan, half of the people who learn about my travels ask me if I've seen this film. It is a popular film to like among philosophers and travelers alike, going against the mainstream Hollywood bang. Many of my favorite films are far more depressing than Lost in Translation, but Lost just seemed to be lacking a real message. The film has great cinematography and the characters certainly have their moments, but unless you are a huge fan of realism, this film may leave you feeling empty, one scene after another.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
This movie is NOT for the Japanese viewers,"In this website, I wrote for ""The Last Samurai"" that I very much enjoyed the movie regardless of some of the minor ""inaccurate"" depictions, and even went on to say that the movie gave me the impression that it may have infact been dedicated to the Japanese viewers from the start. By contrast, this ""Lost in Translation"" movie gave me the impression that the movie may not have had the slightest idea of the impression that the Japanese viewers may have after watching this movie.The only message that this movie can deliver to the Japanese is ""I have spent some time in Japan and this is what I find so ridiculously strange and funny about your people. Yes, I know I haven't spent enough time in Japan to know better about the REAL Japan. Yes, I know I did blow up the situations to make it an easier laugh for the American viewers. But I don't really see why not. After all, I don't really care what you think about what I think about you, because you're not the main subject of this movie. This movie is about two Americans who just happen to be in Japan at the time, and not about you at all. Therefore, don't take it too personal."" How can viewers in Japan, after gradually digesting the above message in the course of watching through this movie, still be able to fully appreciate the main story of the movie concerning these two lonely Americans and connect with them?Imagine this, a Japanese version of ""Lost in Translation which goes on in the following manner:All Americans appear wearing cowboy hats, eating hamburgers everyday and are extremely overweight, with no lines in the movie. The situations are being blown up and they are acting very silly, providing Japanese viewers an easy laugh. The only American who gets to speak in the movie is Hulk Hogan, the wrestler (playing the ""Matthew Minami"" role in the movie) who does his usual performance on the ring. Can American viewers still be able to appreciate what the movie was actually trying to deliver (i.e. two lonely people)?Meanwhile, I have nothing against Bill or Scarlett. I think they did a decent job.All I can say is that this movie is definitely NOT for the Japanese viewers to watch. Coppola may say ""If you don't want to watch, you don't really have to and I wasn't expecting you to."" and that is everything that she is.Sophia, grow up and stop pretending to be a cosmopolitan when you are only more American than anyone else.

From the first scene Charlotte's butt to the Big Bed (the director made everything very nice and reasonable, so it was never too much), but along with the story's telling, then you feel it's not gonna happen, there is no passion of that kind of feeling.

Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson are perfect for their roles and could not have done a better job! Bill plays the depressed actor pitch perfect with his usual quirky humor along the way. Scarlett is incredible as the young woman questioning her marriage and trying to find herself along the way. She really brings a sophisticated kind of sexiness to the role.

Tokyo holiday,"Obviously, when we go to a foreign country, we're likely to experience some unexpected things. I guess that there's nothing outlandish about the possibility of a burnout actor and a neglected wife growing attached to each other. In ""Lost in Translation"", that's just what happens to Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson). Alone in the glitzy world of Tokyo, these two souls find in each other just what any isolated person seeks.Along with being a relationship story, ""Lost in Translation"" is also a look at Tokyo, much the way that ""Roman Holiday"" was a look at Italy's capital. My favorite scene was the commercial scene. Maybe this movie wasn't any masterpiece, but it certainly was an interesting look at how surroundings - and previous experiences - can affect peoples' relationships, whether positively or negatively.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One cinema's very best,"I'm not accustomed to giving movies such a high rating (actually, I'm not accustomed to giving any films any rating...this is my first one), however this film truly deserves it. It's striking in its simplicity, deeply moving, and wonderfully acted. Never has a movie made me think about what a ""relationship"" truly means. It is NOT boring, as some have suggested. Crawl inside of this film. Watch it more than once. You'll be glad you did.Other recommendations: The Shawshank Redemption Million Dollar Baby Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Almost Famous, Match Point, Before Sunset, Before Sunrise",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
This movie has a good heart,"I liked this movie for its aspirations to tell a love story with the exotic backdrop of Tokyo which at the time this movie was made was kind of rare for an American movie. Ironically, Kill Bill (which features Tokyo scenes) also was shot in the same year. And that is also around the time the director Sofia Coppola and Kill Bill Director Quentin Tarantino began dating. Maybe just a coincidence.I like Sofia Coppola. She has the genetics for movies, is smart, understands characters, has enough of a of a Lubitsch.erotic sensuality to this movie while not pushing the limits of the characters.Coppola is respective to the young Scarlett Johansson. She gets the best out of Bill Murray, who underplays his character while doling out his great physical comedy skills and tricks. I don't think this movie could have been made today.At the same time, a lot of this story is unrealistic. There are some holes in the script. My understanding is a lot of the movie was written on the fly with improvisation and not a lot of dialogue.The relationship between Johansson and Ribisi could have been fleshed out a little more perhaps.The ending is totally unrealistic again which makes this a 6 for me instead of perhaps a 7.It's a great effort but not a great movie, But worth seeing.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Lost In the Hype,"Finding time to see only a few movies a year, I made a point to see Lost in Translation.  I wish I'd read the comments on this site warning that this would be the most boring movie I've ever seen.  While I usually like slower movies without lots of action, this film was interminable.  Lost in Translation must be the most overrated movie I've ever seen.... Against my better judgment, I watched the film a second time - I thought at the first viewing I had completely missed what everyone was raving about.  Sadly, the second screening did not get better.Here's hoping someone out there will save their $3.99 or rent Six Degrees of Separation instead.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"""Lost in Translation"" Not Lost in Translation","I'm a Japanese and has just returned from seeing ""Lost in Translation,"" which opened today in Tokyo. Having read some negative reviews, particularly from the perspective of ""stereotyping"" of the Japanese, I expected the movie might not be very enjoyable, but I find it fascinating instead and actually laughed many times watching the movie.I think that the movie captures fairly well how contemporary Japan, in which modern, busy parts are mixed with old, serene traditions in a chaotic way, looks to the two Americans who have little knowledge about or interest in the country they are staying. I can understand well that they feel lost, surrounded by a language, people, and customs they are not familiar with.With regard to the pronunciation of English words, I think that any Japanese who has once learned English knows that it is very difficult to make a distinction between ""L"" and ""R"", as there is no such distinction in Japanese. And I understand well that would be funny to native speakers of English, as the two Americans in the movie.But I think that would be the case when you hear foreigners speaking your mother tongue, not limited to English. I'm happy to tell my friends coming from abroad that it is not easy for Japanese to make distinctions not only between ""L"" and ""R"", but also between ""B"" and ""V"", ""TH"" and ""S"" and some others.On the scene of the elevator, showing that the leading actor is taller than the Japanese around him, I think it is true that the Japanese are shorter in average, and this scene suggests that he feels a little out of place. Actually, being too tall does not necessarily has positive implications in Japan.I think the scene of the prostitute is a little overdone. And the scene of the nude dancers would not be really necessary to the plot of the movie. But such dancers do exist in Tokyo, and you could go to see them if you would like to, however disturbing that might be.I think it is true that Japanese characters in U.S. movies tend to be portrayed as one-dimensional, lacking emotional or intellectual depth, but that is not new, and Japanese are all aware of that. As far as I understand, the focus of the movie is not on forming a relationship between the two Americans and the Japanese surrounding them, but rather lack of it, corresponding to their lives back in their home country. In that sense, I think it would be appropriate for the movie to emphasize that they don't understand what the Japanese are talking or doing around them.Some people might enjoy laughing at the Japanese who mix ""L"" and ""R"", but as far as I'm concerned, I'm rather amused by the Americans who are confused in a foreign country of which they have little knowledge. I guess there might be even some Americans who are offended by this portrayal of their fellow citizens as being ignorant and arrogant.YARIME Masaru",,Anonymous,Comedy
Sofia Coppola's Dad Taught Her a Little Something About Directing,"O.k. so maybe Sofia Coppola can't act, but the girl sure can write and direct.""Lost in Translation"" is her sweet, melancholy story about two strangers at very different points in their lives (Bill Murray and Scarlett Johannson) who nevertheless form a deep connection brought about by the culture shock both keenly feel while adrift in Tokyo. There's no ick factor here due to the age difference, because Coppola's screenplay does not fall into the cliché of having this be a romantic adventure. Instead, it's about two different people who find a friend in an unlikely place just at the point in their lives when they both desperately need one.Murray's trademark hangdog humor is put to perfect use, while Johansson gave us an early indication of her acting chops.Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The most beautiful lovestory I´ve ever seen,"The movie is very calm but because of the simplicity, the feelings it wants to transfer feel very real. It´s an outstanding mix of romantic, subtle humor and melancholy. It has never been too cheesy or cliché. The story is easy and the love of the characters is too, but the circumstances aren´t, or maybe they are? The movie left me happy and sad at the same time but mostly with confused feelings (in a good way).

A mirror of nuances,"""Lost in Translation"" is by all accounts a huge film. Telling of a 50-something married man (Murray) and a 20ish married woman (Johansson) - both Americans stuck in a hotel in Tokyo with too much time on their hands - who come together to soothe the yearning they both have for companionship, ""Lost...."" is a sometimes funny, sometimes poignant, and always sensitive look at the importance of being human. Masterfully struck from little more than nuances with slick art and technicals, this Coppola coup will tell you more about who you are than about the two principals. ""Lost in Translation"" will speak most loudly to anyone who has ever experienced the love which could never be. (A)",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The Universal Language of Lost in Translation (2003),"Lost in Translation (2003) - [10/10]I really don't know what to say. It's incredibly hard to put into words the experience I just went through and witnessed. I guess I'll start with where it all began: the Coppola family. Jeez Louise what on Earth are the Coppola's eating for breakfast? Francis Ford Coppola and wife Eleanor Coppola must be feeding their children some sort of filmmaking breakfast, because all three of their children (themselves included) are spectacular filmmakers. Roman Coppola, Sofia Coppola, and Gian-Carlo Coppola all have done something remarkable in film; particularly Sofia. Whatever it is they're eating, I want some. Sofia Coppola crafted an exquisite piece of cinema in the form of Lost in Translation (2003). This film is so remarkably written, I am not at all surprised she won Best Writing, Original Screenplay at the 76th Academy Awards. In my opinion I would have loved to see her win more, such as Best Director (she was actually the third female director to ever be nominated for that category) but Peter Jackson definitely deserved it. I don't think I would have been able to decide between Coppola and Jackson. Everything feels so natural in Lost in Translation (2003). It doesn't feel scripted, and that's how amazing it is. The events that unfold are unpredictable, simply because life is unpredictable. It is so subtle, everything she sets up I mean, yet at the same time it isn't. It takes multiple viewings to pick up on some of the subtleties because there are so many. Things that are mentioned, seen, or even thought from our leads come back in new ways. It's really the subtleness of the film that impacts the audience the most. These subtle things suddenly reappear right before the audience's eyes and it's beautiful to see. The direction is masterful. Clearly she's picked up some things from her father, and improved upon those things. She's able to conjure emotions in her characters and in the audience, emotions that have never crossed the cinema screen. It's spectacular in that way. I felt things I have never felt before. This film is real. It is incredibly real, to the point where it's almost as if you're watching a documentary and a small portion of two people's lives. We're able to really empathize with these characters as a result. These characters are real people that could exist, and probably do. For a large portion of the film, I forgot I was watching Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson acting. Masterful direction and writing makes you feel lost in this film. Lost in the beauty. This film completely changed the dramatic romance genre. It wasn't focused on a man or a woman. It was focused on both at the same time. It doesn't feel like a romance, yet at the same time it does. It's really interesting. The characters in this film aren't necessarily in love with each other, but they need each other. They need each other for that portion of their lives and it changes them. Just as it can change the audience that views this film. We get the sense that this is not your typical romance film from the very first, opening shot. It isn't about physical love, but emotional love for each other's well-being. The impact this film had can be seen in many other films such as Her (2013). Spike Jonze actually wrote and directed it, Sofia Coppola's ex-husband. A lot of Lost in Translation (2003) is actually based off of her experiences in Tokyo with Spike Jonze which is quite interesting. I actually prefer this film over Her (2013), but both are really similar. I think it can be said that without Lost in Translation (2003), pieces like Her (2013) would not have been made. The casting in this film is perfect. No one else could have pulled this off if Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson weren't cast. The age gap was not a problem. It wasn't weird or disgusting, but oddly beautiful. We smiled with their characters. We laughed with their characters. We cried with their characters. If someone else played Bob Harris (Murray's character) it would have been creepy. He was perfect in this film. He truly became his character (partly because Coppola wrote his role with him in mind). His mannerism, eyes, facial expressions, how he sits, stands - everything is purposeful and believable. I was able to tell what his character was thinking just from his eyes, and I knew exactly what he was going to do next before it even happened. There's a reason he was nominated for Best Actor. He should have won. This is probably my favorite performance by him and is actually his favorite film he's made. He's hilarious, serious, but at the same time you can tell he's pained and that something is terribly wrong. Masterful acting on his part. Scarlett Johansson is really good in this film as well. She utilized the same techniques that Murray did, as she also became her character. She was only 17 when this was being filmed, so to be able to pull off the things she did is quite incredible. Her skill as an actress can be seen in this performance at a very young age. A lot of this film is just that - incredible. A lot of people become upset with this film's depiction of Tokyo. It relies on a lot of Japanese stereotypes in the form of animated caricatures of people. I didn't find it disrespectful at all. As a tourist in a foreign country I know that that's how I've felt towards the different peoples and cultures. You really only see the stereotypes because you don't quite understand their people. It is no different in this film. We center on two Americans in the foreign world of Japan, so it only makes sense that we only see the stereotypes of Japan because that is what out characters see. It isn't meant to be insensitive, it is meant to be true. (I know the length of this review is long, so I'll try and simplify other parts if the film.) The cinematography is really beautiful and meaningful. The soundtrack is perfect to place us in the shoes of our characters. The editing is perfect. Everything about this film is perfect. I truly enjoy and love this film. It's probably my favorite romance film ever. It's a masterpiece. It is the small moments that hit hard. Such as the moments where, typically, the love interests in a romantic film would get intimate, but in this film they don't. Instead, our two characters simply talk. They talk about their problems, and solve them for each other without directly knowing they did so. These are the types of moments that come together to form Lost in Translation (2003). Some phrases aren't always the same when translated into different languages. Films aren't always the same when translated into different languages. People aren't always the same in different, new locations. A lot is lost in the act of this translation (or relocation in terms of people traveling). But what is never lost and what is the universal language, is emotion. Emotion is never lost in Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation (2003). Sometimes it will hit you like a brick. Other times it will softly tap on your shoulder - or whisper in your ear. But emotion, emotion is constant throughout this film. This universal language whispers into your ear as you watch this masterpiece, it whispers and whispers until the words are incomprehensible. And at that point, the film resolves. (This film features one of my favorite endings in film history). These final words stay with you as the credits roll, and as the experience that is (and was) Lost in Translation (2003) ends - it only just begins. Coppola plants a seed in your soul that begins to sprout as the credits roll. It begins to sprout seconds after the film is over. Minute after minute. Hour after hour. Day after day. Week after week. Month after month. And in some cases, year after year. This seed is the universal language - emotion. That is what a film should do. The best films begin when you walk out of the theater. This film has the power to change you through that seed, if you let it. It will open your eyes to new ideas, feelings, peoples - and emotions. Lost in Translation (2003) is a film that will become a part of you after viewing it (you'll be bilingual in a new universal language as well). It is incredibly hard to translate how I felt to words, because it is such an experience. So I highly encourage each of you to watch this film for yourself. To feel what I felt. To experience what I experienced. (This film is very much not rated R. There is only one sequence in this film that makes it R and it is completely useless. It lasts for 1 minute and 3 seconds, but it is pointless. If that is the main reason why you haven't seen this film, I can send you the timestamp and explain what happens so you can skip over it. You need to see this film). Even as I finish this review, a lot of how I felt is indescribable. I fear that what I have translated from this universal language will be lost.

"About two empty and emotionless people ""not"" having a good time in Japan","(2003) Lost in Translation
DRAMAPlot less but showcases two aimless people while staying at a developed city such as Tokyo! This is the soul searching of motionless people of Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) struggling to find some purpose while staying on a foreign city! Everyone else who're around them seem to be inconsiderate a-holes! This plot is nothing new and had already seen something like this from other film's and are better which consist the same caliber such as the neglected wife since the husband's always working leaving the wife to find other means to keep herself entertained etc.. with the only difference that this film imposed traits Bill Murray would normally act in real life and Scarlett Johansson except Scarlett's role is somewhat contained and would never act like this in real life- she is not that ignorant! Also, read a previous review (I forgot who I read this from) which I can totally resonate with in terms of it's criticizing of this film which is somewhat of a semi- autobiography of Sofia Copplola spoiled privileged child hood life while hanging around her famous director father Francis Ford Coppola whose made a name for himself on such films such as ""The Godfather"" and ""Apocalypse Now"", where he had once went to Tokyo, Japan with her little sibling daughter Sofia with him and besides being ignorant about Japanese culture with gorgeous places to look at like for instance the gorgeous view of the city, she was instead bored to hell! I don't know anyone can get bored by staying at any well developed city such as Tokyo even if one couldn't understand the language as opposed to a poor oppressed one like Haiti! Besides this film being totally overrated and saved by the ending, that while I was watching this, I was wondering how much had her dad had his hand in the process of making this film as an executive producer which means that even though he was credited as exec. Prod. By name only, he may have helped her in directing parts of this film! And unsurprisingly Sofia hasn't done much of anything else, after her Oscar win for Best Screenplay. One of the contradictions this film display is if the characters were that bored, would they turn their head to gaze out their window while riding on a cab for instance or would they not look at anything at all.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I think I know what he whispers at the end.,"Bob (Bill Murray), a fading movie star, and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), an unsettled newlywed, are two very different people, with something very real in common - their loneliness. They inadvertently find each other in a hotel bar in Tokyo, as Charlotte is left alone by her jet-setting photographer husband, and Bob struggles to get through his $2m dollar contract to promote various products with a sense of humour. Although attracted to each other, their growing feelings are not based on lust, rather on mutual respect and understanding. Key scenes in the film display this brilliantly - from Charlotte smiling innocently at Bob in the hotel lift, to Bob tenderly caressing Charlotte's foot in one of the most character-revealing moments in the film.Bill Murray well deserved his Oscar nomination for his portrayal of a fading film star - a part extremely close to home, perhaps, given his somewhat fading status himself before this film. Johansson gives a sophisticated, heart-breaking performance of 25-year old Charlotte, with a maturity far beyond her real-life 18 years at the time of filming. Her face is one, for some reason or another, you simply have to watch.Murray and Johansson have amazing chemistry. At times, they only need to look at each other to communicate how they're feeling - in fact, they don't converse that much at all. This is refreshing in a day and age when communication is so impersonal - we rush off a quick phone call, we punch in a text, we fire off an e-mail; when do we just stop, and look into someone's eyes? This theme is made all the more poignant by the surroundings of Tokyo: in a land of technology and new inventions, Bob and Charlotte's quiet inter-play is played out against a background of innovative architecture, flashing lights, and natives enthusiastically absorbed in the latest noisy gadgets.Some critics and viewers have claimed there is no definitive plot to Lost in Translation. This is perhaps true, but what can be more real, or more plot-inspiring, than human nature? Bob and Charlotte's subtle exchanges are worth ten explosions in some of the more mindless action films. However nor is this a typical will they/won't they rom-com fare - although there are some comedic moments interspersed with serious concepts, LIT doesn't fit neatly into any genre.Writer and Director Sofia Coppola has created something very special here, and something as close to perfection as a film can be. The imagery is breath-taking and the score perfectly apt. The unpredictable ending will break your heart, and you'll want to watch this film again and again - though you may not quite be able to put your finger on why. However this is again a reflection of life - unexplainable emotions; just like those contained in the film. Watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
much to appreciate if we watch with an unbiased view,"Set in the city of Tokyo, Lost in Translation introduces us to Bob, an alienated middle-aged actor, who meets an equally alienated young lady by the name of Charlotte. Their shared unease and anxiety stem from their unfamiliar surroundings and their displaced families. This film describes how they find modest relief through their encounter.Director Sofia Coppola produced this film on the basis of her own experience in Tokyo. Inspired by the mood and view of the city, LiT is a record of what she perceived and felt, honestly described from her delicate point of view. The Tokyo she depicts is inorganic and also creates a stateless atmosphere filled with neon and locked rooms, like a karaoke room and a parlor. She also includes comedy elements developed from what she found amusing and funny in Japan.Some people criticize the way Japanese are portrayed in this film, arguing that they are portrayed too one dimensionally. Indeed there are some portraits that create unpleasant feelings and are not convincing. For example, the scene in which a woman suddenly comes into Bob's room and tries to seduce him goes too far, even if it is intended as a joke. Although non-Japanese viewers may be naively amused, some Japanese viewers may feel unpleasant and insulted.On the other hand, the portrayal of Japan in this movie may be truthful to the experience of foreigners, who may at first find Japan queer, eccentric and mysterious. To see in the same country within a matter of days neon cyberpunk scenes in Tokyo along with traditional Kyoto temples and gardens must be striking for visitors. And scenes such as Bob's head jutting out of the crowd of small Japanese in an elevator can be seen almost anywhere there are westerners in Japan.In the end this movie, though, is not about Japan and or about cultural differences but about alienation in a foreign environment. Bob and Charlotte, who share a sense of loss, could never be attracted to each other except in this kind of foreign environment. If they were in their homeland, they would live without being aware of a sense of loss for themselves and would not approach each other. Their encounter is possible and valuable because it takes place in a foreign environment in striking contrast to their own.Lastly, the overall atmosphere of this film is very attractive. The scenery of the city is especially attractive, even to Japanese used to seeing it, and the music adds a tasteful and melancholic air. There is much to appreciate if we watch with an unbiased view.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Terrible movie. Complete waste of my time. 0/10,"I have to say I am absolutely gobsmacked by the fact that this movie has won so many awards. It is just utter rubbish. Basically it's about a spoilt brat and an ageing perv who get it together because they are so stupid that they are incapable of doing anything but feeling sorry for themselves. You're in a different country - go out, go sightseeing, try the local food, go shopping, learn about the country, or even go and spend the day at the hotel pool, reading a good book - don't sit there feeling sorry for yourself and look for someone to cheat with. I have to say that it is beyond me how any self-respecting intelligent individual should relate to these characters. The very fact that this movie is liked by so many people is a sad reflection of our society.

A subtle masterwork from a sophomore effort,"When ""Lost in Translation"" opens, Bill Murray is riding in the back of a hotel limousine along the Ginza Strip, looking like the jet-lagged visitor to Mars that he feels like.  The hyper-bright and colorful animated signs surround him, but he's simply too groggy to comprehend, much less construct defenses against them.  A stranger in a strange land, indeed.The limousine arrives at the hotel and, in an almost throwaway moment the tone is set for the rest of the film: a hotel employee, wearing white gloves, carefully waves the limousine into position, as if the safety of a jet full of passengers depended upon his direction.  Although the car stops a little short of his intended placement at the curb, the ""conductor"" waves ""stop"" after the fact, as if he intended it all.  Perhaps this was an homage to the great director Jacques Tati, but regardless, it is as hilarious as it is subtle.  Those who perform, do so without really satisfying, no matter how earnestly they try.Bill Murray's character--""Bob Harris""--is clearly modeled on Clint Eastwood, if Eastwood had stopped starring in films in the late '70s rather than going on to be a good dramatic actor and fine director.  More about this later. ""Bob Harris"" is a ""movie star"" who hasn't made a film in years, but has joined the ranks of so many other Western performers, making their living as pastiches of their former selves, making appearances and shilling products in Japan.  Bob Harris has been brought to Tokyo to film a few commercials for the giant distillery Suntory, to promote their (rather characterless) whiskey.  Being paid $2 million for the ignominy of parodying his past roles barely makes up for the bruising to his ego, but temporarily escaping his unhappy marriage is a definite bonus.While staying in the hotel, he happens to meet a 20-something American woman (""Charlotte"") who has come to Japan with her vapid husband, a trendy fashion photographer.  Bob Harris recognizes in her the unspoilt beauty of youth and innocence he (and his harridan wife) lost long ago.  She sees in him a charming, sophisticated rogue who is her intellectual equal--in short, the man her husband will never be.  Their relationship develops in fits and starts, by intention but mostly by accident, as they face insomnia, alienation and the feeling of redundancy.About the Eastwood connection: not only is ""Bob Harris"" clearly a tough action movie star, he even catches himself on late-night TV in a regrettable movie from the '70s where his sidekick is an ape--a transparent reference to Eastwood's flick ""Every Which Way but Loose"".  Suntory has hired Murray to pitch their product, but no matter how he tries to please the commercial's director, he cannot follow his lengthy Japanese instructions.  Likewise, ""Charlotte"" finds herself unable to perform her role as wife and recent college graduate (with a degree in philosophy), as life has neglected to specify exactly what it expects of her.Coppola has said that she wrote the part (she wrote, directed and co-produced this film) with Bill Murray specifically in mind.  In this, she took tremendous risk, as she did not know if he would accept or appreciate the role.  Her casting--and his acceptance--of the part was a doubly-serendipitous move.  It's hard to imagine anyone other than Murray in the part, and I've never seen him do more with a role.  When one thinks of him in roles other than broad comedies, ""The Razor's Edge"" usually comes to mind.  Murray did the best he could with Maugham's story, but it was not the ideal vehicle for his dramatic abilities.  ""Lost in Translation"" however, is that vehicle.  If he never does another dramatic film, this would be as good of a role for him to be remembered for as he could hope for.  He is simply marvelous in it.Scarlett Johanson is luminous and fragile, while maintaining a certain underlying strength.  Perhaps her role could've been filled by one of a number of different star or starlets, but the fact that she isn't TOO pretty or too well-known works in the film's favor.  I cannot fault her performance.There is a hilarious running gag about the lounge performers at the hotel. The usual entertainment is a female singer and male pianist who call themselves ""Soulsalito"".  Most people won't get this, but the woman performer must be based on Maria Muldaur, the singer who had a hit song with ""Midnight at the Oasis"", back in 1973.  Muldaur lives just a couple of miles north of Sausalito, of which ""Soulsalito"" is a pun.  Beyond the physical resemblance to Muldaur, the singer even warbles ""Midnight at the Oasis"" in a scene in the hotel room.  Surely Sofia Coppola met Ms. Muldaur at a party in Marin County, where her father, Francis Ford Coppola often visits friends. But I digress.""Lost in Translation"" has moments of great beauty, such as a scene set in a Shinto temple complex where Charlotte watches a wedding procession and a heartbreaking gesture where the groom extends his hand to help his bride up the temple steps.  Blink, and you'll miss it, but it's there as a point of reference for the hopes encapsulated in new relationships and fresh love. There are also moments of hilarity, from a scene set in a strip club to a brilliant scene of Murray swimming in the hotel pool while an aquatic exercise class takes place nearby.  This is a film so well-balanced as to be uncatagorizable as ""comedy"", ""drama"" or anything else.I strongly disagree with other reviewers who claim that ""Lost in Translation"" or its characters criticize or lampoon the Japanese people. This is an unfairly shallow reading of the film.  I found great affection for the Japanese people expressed here.  Making a joke about the Japanese pronunciation of English does not constitute criticism, and the jokes expressed by the actors are more a reflection of their own feelings of alienation than anything else.  In fact, the film is much more critical of American culture, from its cult of celebrity to its institution of loveless marriage.  Interestingly, the more damning the review, the more poorly it was written.  Draw your own conclusion from that.This is not to suggest that ""Lost in Translation"" doesn't have a few faults, but that some entirely missed the boat on the tone of the film, and then disparaged it for not meeting their expectations.  It's like criticizing ""My Dinner with Andre"" for not being a cooking show.  If you are expecting a comedy (which in Hollywood today can only mean ""screwball comedy"") or fast-paced entertainment, don't bother going to see this film.  There's plenty of crap being pumped out by Hollywood that's sure to satisfy you. The fact is that ""Lost in Translation"" is a film for a more sophisticated audience, those who have the patience for subtlety, for carefully nuanced characters with actual character development, and those transcendent moments of ""a-ha!"" that come so infrequently these days.Sofia Coppola proves without a doubt that she is more than a one-shot wonder (with ""The Virgin Suicides"").  Hopefully we will have many more such films from her.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Underlayers,"We never know when we'll cross paths with someone that will leave a mark on us, and we never know for how long those paths will coincide, but when feeling isolated or depressed, that real genuine connection is what saves us.Charlotte and Bob experienced the disconnection of life and the depression that came with it , their attempts to express their feelings came unnoticed by their partners ""jon and lydia"" , and were considered lucky to enjoy a ""vacation"" in Tokyo.It is interesting to see how depression evolves in foreign environment and how ugly it is when the person is stripped from their culture,environment and sense of security.How they only came to feel comfortable with in their own isolation in their hotel rooms.It's not about a romantic adventure..this movie tends to throw it in that direction but I think it interprets the human desire to fight off depression by seeking understanding ..finding companionship.. fighting depression was a mere acceptance of it by experiencing it with someone else.
And the end scene !!!
such a beautiful ending... and sad at the same time. Both Charlotte and Bob developed a deep connection between them (they understood each other). To say goodbye to someone like this is very difficult... I've been through it and I can say that knowing you'll probably not see someone special again is very hard. The moments only stay in the memory... and the person in the heart.They didn't reveal what he whispered to her because we all experienced something like this one way or another and perhaps we never had a chance for goodbye ..so we all have our own version of what she may heard.Thank you Mo for recommending this!",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Amazing Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray, complex multilayered relationship","Two very solitary characters, both with marriage in crisis, bored in Japan and listening people talking all the time a language they do not know. As the woman mentioned either directly ot indirectly, the man is in a mildlife crisis, while she is in a crisis of confidence typical of the youth at its twenties. As they met in the hotel, a strong, acceleratedly intimate relationship, with several complex layers, emerged. The film is delicate and remarkable, and not only because of the good awarded script. It would not have been possible without a competent direction by Sofia Coppola and, I must highlight it, without actors such as Scarlett Johansson and Bill Burray, skilled enough to be able to be so precise in each facial expression of various feelings. Both had unforgettable performances.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Sofia rocks,"The movie takes place in Tokyo, Japan. It is about two persons who stay in the same exclusive hotel not knowing about each other at the very beginning.One of them is Bob Harris (Bill Murray). He's an aging, burn-out film-star who has come to Tokyo to shoot a 2$ whiskey commercial. Most of the time he's plagued by jet-lag and sleepless nights. In addition he feels trapped in Toyko because he neither can speak Japanese nor he has someone to talk to. His marriage has reached an all-time-low and he's in the midst of a midlife crisis. Consequently, for him there seem to be no more challenges on horizon. Obviously he feels lost in his life and trapped in Tokyo. This isolation becomes very clear when he's shooting the commercial or when he sits alone in his hotel-room not knowing what to do. His situation is an air-conditioned nightmare.The other person who stays in the same hotel is Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) who's at the age of 25. She accompanies her husband who has come to Tokyo for business reasons. In opposite to Bob she's at the beginning of her life. She's newly wedded, has graduated from Yale and she's looking for her place in life. Like Bob Harris everything in this city is absolutely alien to her. On one hand there is this strict cultural tradition in up to every gesture and on the other hand there is this amount of technology which over-floats Tokyo. For her Tokyo seems to be a shifted version of western modernity. In addition she's most of time left alone because her husband works all over the day. All these circumstances strengthen Charlotte's feeling of isolation. You can say that she experiences a similar air-conditioned nightmare as Bob does.As YOU can guess -All these parallels are just waiting to be connected:After a few days they discover each other in the westerized hotel-bar in the middle of a sleepless night. Bob Harris is glad for having found someone he can talk to. On the other hand there is Charlotte who needs Bob's humor and attention. Out of their kind conversation develops a strong friendship. I think that these little moments of the development make the film very interesting. After the bar, better said their discovery they meet each other more often. They enjoy Tokyo's nightlife for example by doing karaoke in special bars, once they visit a strip club which they leave fast or they just meet in the bar or in Bob's hotel-room. With every conversation they are more connected to each other and at the end there develops a slight sexual tension between them and both realize that the time in Tokyo is running out ...-----------Great FILM-------------",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
An existential moment...,"I ran across Lost In Translation on cable in March of 2007. Not much of a movie-goer, but this one was worth the wait. Murray is at his best. We see him being human in a way that we rarely allow ourselves to be--real.As the movie unfolded, I became more and more incredulous-- I was experiencing exactly what the characters were experiencing in real time (albeit scenes created for the movie--but then life is a movie, isn't it?) and experiencing it the same way they were. Absolutely wonderful, wonderful existential moment on film. Felliini would have loved it. If you are at all connected to your soul, or wanting to connect to your soul, you will want to watch this movie. Thanks to Ms. Coppola for writing it, and pushing Murray to do it.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Solid, but trivial","It is curious how some reviewers here deride those who did not like Lost in Translation, practically insulting them. Lost In Translation is not a movie for everyone, especially those with a decent knowledge of modern Japan. Nor is it a subtle masterpiece that only emotionless brutes are unable to enjoy. Western cinema must be in a sorry state indeed if an average film like LiT is lit up as the movie of a year because it dares take two steps away from standard formulas like the age-old love story or a clearly defined main character. Those two steps are not enough, they won't take a movie anywhere.Coppola should be given some credit on creating a solid movie and directing an actor like Murray, but the film itself is too void of meaning and message to leave an impression. The main characters are not probed more than shallowly, which is a lost opportunity with an actor such as Bill Murray, and expected with a choice such as Scarlett Johansson, whose young age is so obvious as to harm the credibility of the film. Even with a setting like the futuristic Japan, the movie is not able portray anything which is not already old and rugged from repetition. All in all, if you are expecting an insightful or a masterly directed film, you could very well end up disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
They find each other while both feeling adrift in their own lives.,"What a shame that Bill didn't win his Oscar that year. He delivers one of his most understated and nuanced performances as Bob Harris. His portrayal captures the weariness and disillusionment of a man grappling with his past and present.Scarlett Johansson's Charlotte exudes a sense of quiet introspection and vulnerability, making her character's emotional journey all the more relatable. Scarlett was just 17 when she played this role.Bill and Scarlett have this undeniable connection, making their moments together a blend of sadness, humor, and closeness that you can really feel.""Lost in Translation"" really gets into the whole cultural shock thing. The characters dealing with Tokyo's strange customs, language, and vibe act like symbols of their emotional confusion. The movie shows how being in a totally new place can make you feel even more alone and lost in the big questions of life.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Enjoyable And Innocent,"What's most appealing about this movie is the innocence of the relationship between Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson). The opening half hour or so of the movie sets the stage well for what's to come. Both Bob and Charlotte are essentially ""fish out of water"" characters. Bob is a movie star who's in Tokyo to shoot some commercials, while Charlotte is a young and recent Philosophy graduate who came to Tokyo with her photographer husband who then leaves her for a photo shoot. They're both lost in this strange, foreign city, and while they share that, they're developed very differently. Bob's story is semi-comic, watching him trying to understand his Japanese director and generally adjust to this bewildering city while at the same time contemplating what seems to be a more and more distant marriage, while Charlotte is more of a sad character, alone and lost and also questioning the direction she's taken and her marriage. Eventually, the two of them meet in the hotel bar and develop a semi-romantic and yet always innocent relationship as they help each other deal with their loneliness.This probably could have been developed as a straight romance. In spite of the obvious age difference, Murray and Johansson worked well together and seemed to share a real chemistry, and yet going the innocent route was the right decision. There was a sweetness and even innocent intimacy to their relationship. The innocent intimacy shone brilliantly in a simple scene where they lie fully clothed beside each other in bed, Johansson curled up in a sort of fetal position and sharing her fears of inadequacy, while Murray merely reaches down and strokes her foot. To me, that summed up what they were about together as they helped each other cope with their plights. I found myself wondering if their relationship was going to move to a physical level, and yet spent most of the movie hoping that it wouldn't because that would have spoiled what made this movie work.Murray and Johansson both offered excellent performances in a movie that is simply enjoyable to watch. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Most overrated film of the last 5 years,The film was ponderous and slow moving. One can read anything into a movie and I feel that's what most critics have done with this one. Bill Murray is detached and as unemotional as he could be in his performance. One could say that this is what his character was supposed to be. Does that mean it's a good acting job? I think not.,1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The more you are sure what you want to be.........,"Bill Murray is my main man. I dig him. There are only so many actors in this pathetic world that I will go see EVERY film they've been in. Johnny Depp, Tom Hanks, Will Ferrell are a few others on the select list. I'm not quite sure what Bill is doing in films like Charlie's Angels, or the upcoming Garfield (is it wrong to judge a film before it comes out?) but I'm glad he balances his meaningless Hollywood dribble with things like Lost in Translation, the sophomore effort from Sofia Coppola, after the delightful debut The Virgin Suicides.Lost in Translation, in a sense, contains very positive aspects reminiscent of two of my favorite films from last year: About Schmidt and the best film of last year, Punch-drunk Love. Like Punch-drunk Love, Lost in Translation stars a former Saturday Night Live star (PDL- Adam Sandler; LIT- Bill Murray) in a dramedy about the loving connection two people have. Like About Schmidt, Lost in Translation tackles issues about life, aging and remorse in a very slow, simplistic fashion. Plot is not the central point of Lost in Translation: it is about the characters and their interactions.I have always enjoyed the dry witticisms of Bill Murray. Like what Punch-drunk Love did for Adam Sandler, this film epitomizes Bill Murray's body of work. This has got to be the funniest Murray performance since Groundhog Day I kid you not. Murray shifts from self-loathing, sarcasm, shock and sadness within minutes of each other, sometimes with the simple use of his eyes and his tone of voice. What would Murray be without a strong female actress to carry the torch of the film with him? Scarlett Johansson has been good in great films before (Ghost World, The Man Who Wasn't There) but this performance blows those supporting roles away. She is quite possibly better than Murray though it is hard to compare such unique and wonderful jobs. Her role is more difficult than Murray, in that we forget about Scarlett the actress and think only of Charlotte. Bill Murray plays a serious, touching Bill Murray, but he's still zeikjesus good.The true master behind the film is Sofia Coppola. Not since Tarantino has a second directorial effort been so outstanding. She achieves what most filmmakers strive to do (and if they don't strive- they surely should). Coppola infuses her plot with extremely personal elements that make this film semi-autobiographical. The viewpoint of Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) is very much the same exact viewpoint Coppola shares. When watching a film, it's always helpful to see what point the director was in their life while making the picture. For instance, look at the works of Polanski directly following the murder of his wife. Watch Chinatown and Macbeth. In the case of Coppola, we learn much about her and Charlotte by reading simply into what is going on in Coppola's life. Then the question is: who is Sofia's Bob Harris (Bill Murray)? Is there a Bob Harris?Charlotte and Bob Harris have a connection. It is a brief friendship, completely platonic, above the means of sexuality.  They love each, perhaps, but a sexual consummation would only lower the film to being nothing more than an oddball romantic comedy. Coppola is smarter than that. These are two characters, through ten days in Tokyo, are able to understand and appreciate one another. Is it short? Yes. Is it no less meaningful? No. It is almost tragic when these two persons leave the film to rejoin their separate paths and the lights go up in the theatre. It is poignant yet depressing in the end. Life's problems cannot be resolved in a simple movie, no matter how hard we try. I was pleased the filmmakers here were aware of that. Little things like Bill Murray gently placing his hand on the sleeping Scarlett Johansson's foot make up this film. THAT is the true essence of the film. Cute particulars always overcome age differences. Take note.It has been described as a `postcard' to Japan. While watching the film, you get some truly amazing shots of Tokyo, including a very bizarre sequence in a video arcade. Bill Murray's interaction with the obsequious and the silly Japanese persons is nothing short of pure hilarity. However, I wondered, `Are there no decent Japanese people in Tokyo?' The answer apparently is no. But the movie is not about analyzing and synthesizing with the Japanese. It is about being lost and attempting to find anew. What better way to externalize how lost you are than to be in a truly foreign city, not even knowing why you're exactly there.Should Lost in Translation be around come Oscar time? Damn well should be. Will it be? If this is a snub, I'm holding a siege on the palace! Hold me to my word, friends. It's on. This film lives up to the buzz and hopefully will avoid the backlash. It is a sweet, character driven piece. Two strong characters, superbly acted, with a subtle, intelligent script and an enticing setting makes Lost in Translation one of the most intelligent films I have seen in a long time.

If we had more time ...,"A famous actor meets a young wife in Tokyo ... that's the story that Sofia Coppola has in ""Lost in Translation"" (2003), a film that its focus is to find the purpose of life and the pursuit of happiness. It has two main characters played by Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson, we see them both as two lost souls and know each separately, but we realize that they share very personal things between them, mainly loneliness. They are neither good nor bad, they are just two people who are going through a difficult situation. Is a plot tender and sad while linearly develops. All that shows is credible: the characters and everything they do. We see them share their sadness and loneliness, struggle to feel better but not solve their problems.It is a film that offers an experience through empathy: both the characters with the audience, like the characters between them.Both performances are excellent, they make great film, as the director dreamed it to be and help that everything is flowing quite naturally, so that the two characters feel real enough. Bill Murray plays a movie star, and despite that, he is not acting like himself, he created the character as such, who is simultaneously happy and sad with his life.It is a simple story that surprises us because it does not fall into the ""clichés"" that anyone would imagine, goes its own way (very realistic) and has an ending that the viewer is less expected.These are two characters who are lost and alone, but when we see them together that's all that matters, regardless of where they are or what they do, because what is striking is the fact that they are happy to see because they are accompanied and because they know that someone cares about them, someone found them.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Murray Overrated...Again.,"The 7 is based on the script, the ambience that has been captured and heavy lifting by Johannsan to carry what could have been a masterpiece over the finish line.The -3 is because of Bill Murray. Truly one of the most overrated yet beloved American actors of our times. An incredible achievement that alone should be applauded.LIT was a bore to watch when it was released as we were living through this aesthetic. To review it now, when this film has stayed in retaining a cult following, especially aesthetically under the inherited nostalgia of the Millenials into Zoomer generation, gives a perspective that will be divisive.LIT is a boring film, even though it's 'meant' to be. But there are ways to create 'ambience' in cinema that carry a film. To stay closer to the source, Coppola IS an incredibly talented director and visionary. Marie Antoinette is one of the greatest American films made, and to this day the push back against it is more indicative of viewers inability to grasp that film in its entirety. I wish this for LIT but the Coppola magic doesn't land as is does even with Virgin Suicides or Beguiled.Johannson truly drags this film to the end. She is fantastic. She was very young but mastered the character brilliantly. The aesthetic built around her is iconic and a touchstone for young people today wanting to capture that magic. Her reoccurring giggle/laugh is such a simple but engaging signature. It constantly warms the viewer to each scene that has been detailed by Murray's feigned dead-pan comedy schtick.Naturally, the weight of Murray is inescapable as part of that aesthetic yet that character really could have and should have been played by anyone else. It couldn't have been that hard to find a tired former Hollywood star spiralling out of a bad marriage.Always wished this film could be more palatable but everytime it just grates.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Maybe this is art?,"First off, nothing really happens in this movie. For an average shallow theatre-goer it may even seem completely uneventful and therefore boring. And I'm positive it was meant that way. There are no heroes, explosions or dramatic scenes. Only ordinary people set in exotic environment. Main characters are apathetic or sad most of the time. They surely have their reasons for that. But there's a tiny little diversion waiting for them.Simple as that. Strongest aspects of Lost in Translation are images and music anyway, dialogs and/or acting are somewhat pushed aside. Suprisingly enough the movie is still entertaining; one moment you're dull just like the characters are and then you find yourself smiling. It's simply an easy film for an easy evening, if you're in the mood.There's really no point in raging about how it is all stupid and dumb and lame and clueless like some of the reviewers did. This flick is only meant to leave an impression and if it is not positive for you, well, tough, you may be lost in translation. There's nothing especially bad about this movie.I do recommend it. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A flair of true friendship,"Lost in Translation is an amazing movie that has won an incredible number of awards, including the 2004 Oscar for Best Screenplay.This is a film about a flare of true friendship. Just like passion flares up, so does friendship sometimes. And if in passion, the leading motive is physical desire, then in friendship, it's most likely the consonance of mental waves. These people simply feel good to be around each other, they have a similar sense of humor, similar values, and a similar world around them. They don't even have to talk, they can just sit together and look at the city. And they know that their thoughts match at this moment.Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is a middle-aged, accomplished actor who came to Japan on an advertising contract. Charlotte, played by 17-year-old Scarlett Johansson, is the young wife of a famous photographer. You can't say that they are lonely. They're just waiting for something. And when they see each other, they understand that they have found.This type of a relationship fills you in, it doesn't break you and it is easy to let go. It doesn't drag you to the bottom like a dead weight, but it lifts you up, showing you the sky above your head. Alas, like many good things in this world, it is short-lived. After returning home, each of them will plunge into their everyday life: family, work, friends. There will be no place in it for such friendship. But they will keep the memory of it for the rest of their lives, and it will warm them on cold winter evenings.Could Bob and Charlotte stay together? Unlikely. Physical intimacy is harmful to a relationship like this. It doesn't add anything to it, rather makes it worse. And even if they ever dream of each other, then only as a family, a person you feel good and peaceful being around.And the alien environment, like Japan, only gives them the opportunity to reveal character traits that have been hidden before.This movie is a great way to make your soul feel at ease. It shows that anything has its place and time in life. It does not give you guidance for the future, but it helps to realize that a human being is something more than physical desires or desires of the mind. They are something elusive - a smile, a glance, warmth, purity.The characters went through all this and took this experience with them inside their hearts, becoming a little better.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Not the best Murray film,"The once famous actor Bob Harris is shooting a TV commercial in Tokyo. Being the only American among Japanese, he feels isolated and out of place. But he soon meets a young American girl, Charlotte, who is also lonely in Tokyo. Being the only English speaking persons around, they become close friends, but avoid a romantic relationship...It's almost incomprehensible what amount of prizes actor Bill Murray won for ""Lost In Translation"" - a BAFTA, Golden Globe, BSFC Award, BFCA Award, CFCA Award, Independent spirit award, LAFCA Award, NSFC Award, NYFCC Award, OFCS Award, SFFCC Awards, Sant Jordi Award, Seattle film critics Award, SEFCA and TFCA Award. Plus he was finally nominated for that damn Oscar. Now, Murray really is a special actor, but ""Lost"" is not one of his best films. It's a good drama, but too simple and silly to be profound or brilliant. It raises an interesting point how two ""outsiders"" can become friends because they have some basic things in common ( like a language or mentality ) and how isolation changes people. Also, it's a very refreshing concept from Sofia Coppola ( who won an Oscar and Golden Globe for this for best screenplay ) to avoid a direct romance between a young woman and older man and just show them in a platonic relationship. But I still have a feeling that ""Lost"" could have been a much better film.--------I've been to Japan and I can relate to some things in the story, but I can't accept that the only interaction of that culture and the American characters is reduced to Bob not understanding what his Japanese director is saying to him while shooting a TV commercial ( the line ""More or Roger Moore?"" is funny, but feels out of place and somewhat too silly ) or Charlotte just aimlessly wondering around a Buddhist temple and crossing a street while a Dinosaur is shown on a TV screen on a building. In the end the plot seems a little stiff and aimless itself. It is definitely a good, quality film, but in my opinion Coppola missed an opportunity to put some more sharpness into it and create a really magic spark, which manifests itself only in the beautiful sad ending underlined by the song ""Just like honey"".Grade: 6/10",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Has the world gone nuts!??,"I'm extremely comforted to see the comments of other users here, who have quite rightly pointed out that this dreadful exercise in tedium should be castigated rather than lauded.The movie boasts competent cinematography, and Bill Murray -- always watchable -- sleepwalks through a script (a script!??

How Johanssen won a British BAFTA for her performance in this is utterly, utterly baffling.  To say that she has a finite range, is inferring she has a range that can actually go from ""A"" to ""B"".

Music camouflages it's weak humour and poor script.,"This movie had a very, very small script that I think could have been written within approximately 3 days. How it could have ever won an Oscar is beyond me, but for me it is clear that Francis Ford Coppola's darling daughter needs much work on her writing skills.The most clear sign of weakness was the overuse of music. The movie is chockfull with ""alternative"" rock music, which was mostly nice, but I could not help but think this was an all too easy way to fill up the movie and camouflage the lack of story and pace. And all the music was just existing pop and rock, not specifically made for the film. I think it is weak to just grab you collection of favorite CD's and put the best parts of those in your movie and try to make it better that way. If music is going to play a major role in a film I would like it to be either originally written for the movie or something I haven't heard before. I despise the lack of true creativity here, I had the same problem with the Kill Bill films.Now, of course, there are plenty of motion pictures that use a lot of existing music to add to the atmosphere, like American Graffiti, and I understand that in this picture the intention was the same. However I felt that this movie could have been so much more had it been written less poorly, if it had more and stronger dialogue, and some tragicomical humour which I mostly missed.The humour in this comedy is not ha-ha-comedy, but it does not appeal in any other way either and is therefore failed as well. I know the Japanese can be very odd but this is not something new, nor is it shown in an amusing way. The movie hits rock bottom when Murray and Johansson go out in Tokyo with all kinds of Japanese rent-a-friends and start dancing and singing to various awful music. The scene was tormentingly long as well.On a more positive note, the performances were all right and Murray and Johansson admittedly make the film a lot better than it could have been (i.e. a turd). The imagery of Tokyo is also pleasant though sometimes shortlived.And it won at least one Oscar. So there's your recipe for an Oscar film:-let an actor or actress play a role against typecasting that he/she has not done before (Bill Murray in a serious role, Charlize Theron as an overweight serial killer, Nicole Kidman with a nose job, Dustin Hoffman as an autist and the list goes on and on).-write a weak romantic story with a twist and cover up it's weakness with lots of music to add feeling;(-make sure the Oscar committee will vote in favour of Daddy's little girl because she's the daughter of Francis Ford ""The Godfather"" Coppola.)As for romantic stories with a twist watch the infinitely superior Groundhog Day with Bill Murray. Now that movie actually WAS Oscarworthy.5 out of 10",,Anonymous,Comedy
Coppola explores alienation and loneliness in a fundamental manner,"Sofia Coppola's non-plot-driven Lost in Translation has much more in common with the works of Éric Rohmer than with the American rom-coms the film may have competed with for viewers back in 2003. It explores alienation and loneliness in a more fundamental, literary manner than had been done in a long time in mainstream movies, and Coppola demonstrated her uncompromising, fluidic directorial style, winning several accolades and awards in the process. The relationship between Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) is wonderfully unorthodox, floundering and lifelike. Feeling alone and cut-off in their mutual Tokyo hotel, most everything begins to feel alien and ridiculous to them - from Japanese customs and culture, and their respective partners rambling on about trivialities, to an entertainment industry which seems increasingly superficial. Still, the two are full of differences, as Murray and Johansson themselves would have been at the time, but in many ways they let themselves become more intimate than you've ever seen two people get on film. Their unconventional friendship/romance is explored completely without prejudice by Coppola, before she wraps it all up with one of the most classy endings in the history of romantic movies. The balanced combination of maturity and vulnerability in Johansson's performance belies the actress' tender age of 17 at this point. A great soundtrack serves as the icing on the cake.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
So simple and so great,"This is a prefect example of a movie that's not about a plot, but about a mood. A simple story about two lonely people. It captures a sort innocent awkwardness that's both very relatable and really touching.Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson are amazing and work extremely well together. Their chemistry is subtle and awkward, which works perfectly for the tone of the movie.The karaoke scene is probably one of my new favorite movie scenes ever.I love the ending. I love the soundtrack.

"Brilliant, absolutely brilliant.","Unfortunately this web-side doesn't give the opportunity to give a distinguished 11 of 10 in special cases such as this. The film Lost in Translation is the film of the year, even better than the Block-buster-success Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. Why? Simply because of the way it's made. The film doesn't offer you a lot of action or thrilling moments, but what it does have is beautiful sceneries. You really see that Sofia Coppola is the daughter of the master himself Francis Ford. I think that the film, when we talk about the sceneries, is very similar with Francis' Apocalypse Now, the many views of Tokyo compared with e.g. the scenes from the trenches in Apocalypse Now, the views, the light and the sound.Lost in Translation is a small everyday story which is still unique. The story is simple, yet very complicated. We meet our main characters and get to know them and their problems: he's in a midway crisis, she's married to a man which she really doesn't know. However, the story that lies beyond that shall remain unknown to us.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
very good movie,"This movie is a mixture of soft romance and comedy that makes you think more about your personal life and how lucky one is in this world who has found true love.Amazing performances by both Bill Murray and Scarlett Johannson are the stars of the show. Sophia Coppola has done a really good job in getting the best out these two actors, so much so that, by the end of the movie, you still end up waiting to see more of them.The movie showcases a mature relationship between two adults(the loner Bill and the neglected Scarlett) who know how difficult marriage really is, as they get to find each other in Tokyo.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Lost in Translation, put simply, is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. Something about this movie struck me and I weeped at the end. The cinematography is amazing and the locations visually stunning. The acting is superb, with Bill Murray turning in an excellent performance and Scarlett Johansson giving quite possibly one of her greatest performances yet. This movie will make you think about your life up to this point and everything you have done to get to this point.

Lost in Boredom,This is the second Sofia Coppola movie I've wasted time and money on...never again.Bill Murray was insipid and uninspiring as an actor. Scarlett was beautiful and luminous.

Strangers In A Strange Land,"This is a romantic comedy that is unlike others. Director Sofia Coppola feels confident and in control of her vision, which is unconventional. She establishes a tone that is gentle and patient, full of atmosphere immersed in Japanese culture and isolationism.Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is a fading cinema star who is in Tokyo to make a whiskey commercial. Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) is there because her husband is a photographer on assignment. While he is working, she wanders around or looks out over the city from her hotel window. Bob and Charlotte are coping with alienation and doubts about their marriages.The screenplay (which won an Oscar) allows the characters to live in their solitude while the viewer watches, wondering if the two will recognize the similarity of their situations. Eventually, they do bond because of his humor and a companionship originating in their shared isolation. But what will become of them?Not everyone will enjoy the slow boil that this film employs, or the unconventional nature of the main relationship. But there is a payoff in the tenderness of the film for those who enjoy genuine connection in any form.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Very touching cinematography, acting, sound, music, story.","Lost in Translation is my favorite movie so far. Everything in it truly connected for me. Coppela successfully reproduced many of the most memorable feelings and experiences I have from visiting Japan and my relationships there. Something I never thought could be documented or explained to others, yet there it is on screen, on DVD, for anyone to enjoy. Everything about the entire movie just hit very close to home for me.Although the movie portrays the protagonists as pampered and well-to-do (living in their Hyatt ivory tower), this actually lends to the believability of their work (in real life I'd guess Coppela and these actors -are- pampered and well-to-do) and it lends to the sense of distance and alienation of the characters, a central theme in the movie. Adding in a believable love story, some phenomenal cinematography, sound, music, cultural insight, etc. and summing it all up in about 100 minutes was a very impressive feat if you ask me.One thing worth mentioning before I continue, is that despite its accuracy and realism depicting Japan, the movie isn't really about Japan, or even Japanese people, as much as it's about the kind of introspection, personal confusion, and perhaps bonding, that can take place when all other elements of familiarity are removed. I think it's to all parties credit that in fact this personal side of the story is told with such subtlety and so believably that it goes without much criticism. Despite this, having traveled to nearly a dozen different countries, I have to say Tokyo is one of the cities that feels most foreign for me (even though I lived in Japan a few years), so frankly I can't imagine a better location for filming this kind of story. Again though, it's worth pointing out that this isn't so much about Tokyo as much as it's about two people helping each other feel not quite as lost as they'd otherwise have been (not just culturally, but emotionally as well).The movie is a brilliant combination of personal and shared experience. The polite Japanese formalism and expressions which leave you feeling you've met everyone but don't really know anyone. Its a phenomenal introspection and brilliant depiction of being emotionally lost in a new marriage, or in mid-life crisis, accentuated by being lost in a strange culture.The scenes at the Karaoke parlor, heading home that night, and a later discussion on the bed are all very endearing and extremely well done. Depiction of the younger couple's differences, as well as Bob's handling the grind of his home life, I think were very accurate, introspective and tie well into the overall sense of isolation and confusion felt by the characters.The movie's cinematography is phenomenal. It does a great job showing Tokyo's modernity, it's crowded gray expanse and cool urban feel, its taken for granted technology and glowing neon glitz. The huge advertisements, videos and signs which blare their messages to the illiterate visitor. The extensive hotel footage and sense of living from a suitcase on top of a bed represents real life for most visitors to Japan. Wandering here and there and making no sense of it, is also the common experience for visitors, and it's conveyed extremely well. Being led by friends to their favorite clubs and hangouts in Japan is a rare treat for Japanese visitors, and for moviegoers to watch. It's simply wonderful to follow the characters as they swim through such a personal and unique experience.There's also very insightful use of sound. The chimes, automated voices, whirs and wisps of cars, trains, automatic doors, elevators, ventilation systems... the troubled English, continual street noise, poor karaoke and constant Japanese spoken in the background, even the international programs on Japanese TV... These truly capture the sound of the foreign experience in Japan, and compliment the internal confusion the characters feel.The dreamy, synthesized music also matches well with the confused, frustrated and sometimes dazzled feelings a person has facing modern Japan alone. The combination of the music with the scenery rolling by (in the train, etc) help convey what it feels like to be pulled around through the country without much control over the trip. The scenes which depict the traditional beauty (in temples, traditions, ceremonies, even flower arrangement) without true comprehension, are amazingly accurate depictions of what an outsider feels in Japan. I'm very impressed with the combination of cinematography, acting, sound and music all driving in a consistent direction to communicate the story and emotion in this film.Some have complained this is a 'stereotypical' depiction of Japan, and of Japanese people. However that's extremely unfair to everyone involved with this movie. The Japanese people are very homogeneous and their culture only involves outsiders at a very surface level. Frankly this 'stereotype' seems honestly the most accurate and truthful way to portray an American's experience in the country. Of course not every Japanese person fits the stereotype. They're not all friendly, polite and hoping to serve rich foreigners. Not all of them are clean-cut students, workers or businessmen. But to Coppela's credit, she introduces a more than generous number of these stereotype breakers as well.I've been sad to read how few people appreciate this movie. Perhaps some people lack the insight, experience and introspection to appreciate the kind of love story, cultural struggle and personal isolation that pulls the characters together. However I truly think this is one of the most thoughtful, insightful, beautiful and touching movies I have ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
What most people were not ready for...,"Lost in Translation is a very misunderstood movie. If you are expecting to have a plot with bunch of twist and suspense, you WILL be disappointed. Its energy doesn't rely on the narrative aspect itself, but more the emotion that it provide. The atmosphere is simple on the first glance but yet very profound in terms
of loneliness and boredom. The film is not boring, but represents the lethargy of Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) and Bob Harris (Bill Murray). Sofia Coppola's goal was probably to emerge an empathy in the spectator, without having to make an effort. Because whoever you are, you highly most likely felt loneliness at one point in your life. It might have been a good feeling or a bad one, but it happened. Lost in Translation provides a nostalgic response to give you a break.You know what? Maybe it's okay to be lonely, to be bored.Two americans in Tokyo; what else to redefine your identity markers. A chance to reborn, a new hope to change a painful or empty life. In a city with multiple possibilites, this movie excels in making you feel something if it isn't by the music, the settings or the well-acted characters.Take it as it is, don't expect a narratively suspenseful movie and you will enjoy where it takes you.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Interesting and dull,"Lost in Translation is a depiction of that easily relatable state of life where we find ourselves completely lost and overwhelmed.

Meanwhile, charlotte, recently married and accompanying her working husband to Tokyo, finds herself desperately abandoned. Both happen to be staying at the same hotel, and amidst their dull lives, they end up sharing a subtle romance.I found the film interesting but not particularly entertaining; in fact, I found it quite dull and slow, especially during the first half.

yes it happens but so what?,"I kept waiting for this movie to have substance.  Would the mismatched couple who find each other in a strange land connect on some meaningful level?  Or would they find that the marriages they had were not so bad - that they had been expecting too much?  Something.  Instead, the only thing they really had was loneliness - in marriage and in a foreign country where they didn't know or understand the culture.  So they found someone who feels roughly the same ... 90% of all in their situation, probably do.  Of course two people from the same culture would connect when having a life crisis amidst strangers.Although I appreciate the subtleties in the acting, the way Murray and Johansson communicate non-verbally, I didn't see many levels of understanding.  What does he know about Ivy League and philosophy?  Nothing. What does she know about being a middle aged, family man or acting?  Do they have anything at all to talk about?  Is life all about such unspoken connections or are those mostly illusions?  I have been in similar situations several times and have come to realize that feelings of connectedness are natural but fade completely from memory and turn out to be silly mirages, later.  The film would have done better to focus on how we imagine we've found someone special under such circumstances, but it's really just common humanity from a familiar country.  Under any other circumstances, the relationship would fall like a house of cards.  This ""story"" is really just a portrait of dissatisfaction, dislocation and drifting among travelers.  So they felt like they found a life raft in a sea of emptiness.  Most of us know better.  The movie made way too much out of nothing, in my opinion.  But the acting was very good, given the lack of script.How I wish Americans (my people) would learn to study and appreciate other languages and cultures more, so that this mentality of looking for ways to avoid strange foreigners is not so common.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Sancta Simplicitas,"I guess I must be shallow, thick and slow. Notwithstanding all the hype around this movie I have so far failed to like it much.I suppose that for those who haven't been to Japan very often & consider it as an exotic or even ""closed"" country (and, hence, who may be stuck in the pre-Meiji era...) there's a fair bit of fairytale in the story. I, however, tend to see the plot in terms of the following two meandering storylines:1) Has-been actor experiences a pang of (post-)midlife crisis in Tokyo. Lonely delectable young abandoned wife hooks up with him. The two are emotionally attracted to each other, but the impermissibilty of a sexual encounter keeps them back. Instead, they live out a few days of Freudian father-daughter infatuation.2) Japan is such a strange and wonderful country!!! 1 1/2 hours of tourist tour of the idiosyncracies of Japanese social life, complete with karaoke bars, game consoles and the social acceptability of meeting your colleagues in striptease bars.On the first account - point 1), that is - I guess the film comes our more convincing than American Beauty, but.... it would have been sooOOOO much better if we'd had a couple of good actors to play the lead parts. Imagine, say, they young lady being able to appear a bit emotionally torn?

What a film.,"This is a movie that will stick with you. At first, I didn't think I would like it. But that night, I thought of how much of an experience this movie is. The emotions captured and the world it brings you to is phenomenal. The acting is amazing. The relationship that Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray have feels very real. The feelings I get from the movie are quite mixed. The main characters are almost never upset with each other, but before they met each other they were miserable. Now, the world this movie is in feels so distant, and yet so close. I guess we can all relate to the story, if we stripped it down and examined its basic premise, but the place the movie is set in is what strikes the audience as unfamiliar. Well, the main characters are unfamiliar with the place they're in. They're two lost souls, in an unknown land. I think that's what makes the movie work. The environment and the story seem to differ so much that they compliment each other. If this wasn't set in Japan, it would seem like an average romance flick. But it's a lot more. It's a bitter-sweet film that can show what the real world is like, which is quite refreshing, compared to all the happy endings nowadays. To be honest, there aren't really any parts that stick, no high points. However, this means that there isn't really any low points either. The ending is also bitter-sweet, I love it. I won't spoil it for you, It's just, realistic, i guess is the best word to describe it. This film deviates every norm of a movie of today. It's one of a kind. It's a different kind of love story. Except it's more of a friendship story. How two stranded people find each other and begin to care for each other more and more as their own lives seem to become less and less of a reality. This movie will stick with you. You will love it more and more as time passes. And I am certain that I will be watching it again in the very near future.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

There's Something Sublime About This Flick,"Anyone who's every travelled alone to a foreign country will heavily relate to this movie and will love it. People who don't ever or don't like to travel probably won't enjoy it. There are so many shots of the characters just doing things by themselves to pass the time--having a bath, swimming, laying in bed, being bored, being confused by strange things around you. This movie is so accurate to the lonely travel experience it's miraculous. I don't see this as anything like a ""romance"", there is something higher going on here--a story about love for another human, an almost stranger... the relationship is so complicated yet very simple--it is the same love that lovers have, that is between friends, that a parent would have for a child. It lets us know that we're all in this together.There is a scene where Bob is singing karaoke and Charlotte is simply looking at him. It is an unbelievable look of love. I rewatch that scene all the time--Scarlett transcends as an actress in this movie. So does Bill, he reminds me of myself.This movie has funny moments, serious moments, intense moments.

LIT draws a fine line between subtle and boring!,"Lost in translation is about many different things and to enjoy it completely you need to be able to identify with most if not all of these things.You need to have some understanding of Japanese culture (or at least of a different culture) and also what it is like to spend time away from home, working, in a foreign country within a foreign culture. You also need to identify with either Bill Murrays mid life crisis or Scarlett Johansson 'just out of college' lack of direction. A slightly uncomfortable marriage would also benefit you with respect to the overall enjoyment of LIT. A desire 'to be found' is also essential!If the above is a good description of you then you will probably find this a very intelligent, subtle and enjoyable movie. If on the other hand you are lucky enough to be completly happy with yourself, your marriage, your work, your future and your life in general, then you will probably find this to be rather slow at best and boring at worst.I was somewhere in middle (found it a bit slow, but very subtle) and will probably watch LIT again in 20 years to see how I react to it then.The movie certainly accomplished what it tried to accomplish but is certainly not for everyone but at some point in everyones life it will probably be for them!",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

It's so much easier finding a purpose of life, if you live just for the sake of surviving and don't live just to entertain or chase status.

But that was all, after the first half the movie started to lose pace, to reach an anticlimactic ending. It seems like a lost opportunity for a really enjoyable movie.

This one is hard..,"On one side, it is a well directed movie with lots of atmospheric context being said with little to no words. A piece of art, of sorts. On the other hand, it's a very simplistic movie with not much going for it.No one is chewing scenery. There are no particularly memorable lines or set pieces. The dialogue is just too realistic, which is great, but also very bad.. unless you want to feel depressed! Then it's great! It's about two people that feel alone somewhere just casually grabbing each other's sleeve in a hurricane.. or something.Also, is it a love letter to Japan? Or is it making fun of it? Was it chosen (as one of many available) places because of the language barrier, the extremes of how dull some of it's places are (mostly housing, if you've been there) and how ""foreign"" it is at places? But this movie would work anywhere, so it ultimately doesn't really matter. As a fan of the culture (and being able to say I've been in some of those places Scarlett stood), I can't say I find it that displacing, but I get it. So, the movie is more about how you are lost somewhere (even in a state of mind), dipped in depression, and how there is nothing like making a connection to get you by. Still, throughout its duration, I can't help but think Bill Murray is having a ""I'm too old for any of this"" moment with Scarlett, and the connection doesn't work for me. But that's also probably the point.. because we tend to find anything we want to attach ourselves to, no matter what it is and how little we actually care. The ""best of what there is"".You know who you are and if you'd like it. Just.. don't expect a cheerful movie, a comedy, or even drama. There's just no enough of that.

Lost in its beauty,"I don't think I have ever seen anything quite like Lost in Translation. Certainly, I have never experienced such calmness after finishing a film. I don't really know how to explain it, there's just something about the way this film moves and flows, and the mood it sets. Something that made me feel extremely content and happy.Since it was the most notable thing about this film to me, I'll start with how it made me feel. Although, it can at times be hectic and fast, at the end of the day, Lost in Translation completely calmed me down. By the time the end credits started rolling, I felt like I had been lost in a whole other world. A world that I would've liked to have stayed in for longer. It's impossible to explain the feeling I had. Some words that might begin to start describing it could be tranquil, content and happy. The mood that this film has is simply magical. It all feels like a dream, and as the final scene comes along, I felt like I, and the characters, woke up to a reality better than the one before.It's hard to describe how I feel about this movie. I think that it's much more an experience than it is just a film. And as with all experiences, they tend to be very personal. I got something out of this film that no else has. And anyone else watching will do the same. The scenes and moments will mean different things to everyone, and we will all find our own meaning in it. I have really learned to love these types of movies lately, and perhaps that's the reason why I liked this one as much as I did. There's something special about a film that is different for everyone. I think it makes the movie stay with you longer, and it ends up being a much more meaningful experience.The only thing that bothered me about this film was the way it significantly slowed down after the first hour or so. Although this film is quite slow at all times, those 20 minutes after the first hour felt a little too slow. However, even though I would've preferred it to be a bit quicker at times, the slowness does allow time for reflection. Something that greatly benefits the film as a whole.I'm sure that many people will find this film to be too slow. It does indeed require a very certain mindset to be enjoyed. But, if you do have that mindset, or if you like slow films that are meant to be experienced, Lost in Translation is wonderful. It's funny, it's sad, it's fast, it's slow, and it's everything you'd want it to be.

If you have an understanding for a feeling of loneliness which doesn't stem from actually being alone it might be very important for you to watch it. Sofia Coppola describes this feeling and the hope that still exists nonetheless in visual perfection and, by that, captures it perfectly. The colors, the music, the humor, the strange scenery and the two main protagonists, amazingly portrayed by Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson - everything falls into place.

As in the earlier movie, though, the characters here remain distant and their motivation vague. One does not empathize with the two main characters; one simply observes them.I would like for Bill Murray to win an Oscar for a dramatic (or comedy) role, but I don't think this is the one. His comic scenes, particularly the shooting of the whiskey commercial, are classic Bill Murray, drole and very funny. However, his rendition of a burned-out actor in midlife crisis, like Jack Nicholson's performance in About Schmidt, substitutes simple passivity for any sort of deeper emotions.There are also some troubling anomalies in the storyline. Why do Bill Murray and his wife have such young kids after 25 years of marriage? Time zones seem confused when he calls his wife at 4 a.m. Tokyo time and reaches her at breakfast.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Quintessential 'Urban Life' Film,"More than any other, this film encapsulates a feeling common in contemporary urban areas: surrounded by people, but completely alone.

"Great acting, great travelogue, draggy second half.","Both the lead actors do a tremendous job, as they must when what they register on their faces has to carry the second half of the movie. But after the first ten minutes or so of these scenes, I understand their feelings and begin to count the hours they have yet to spend with each other before his plane leaves. (I'm also puzzled by why a sophisticated, well-educated young woman can't find anything to stimulate her intellectually in such a novel and rich culture.) The travelogue value of the film pretty well compensates for the unnecessarily repetitious bar- and hotel-room scenes, however.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
This movie moves me,"I am a huge fan of Sofia Coppola. This is my fifth time seeing this film. It always moves me. It's subtle and strong simultaneously. She has a way with the soundtrack, also displayed in Marie Antoinette, another one of my favorites. She captures emotion at a deeper level through music, visual, and the actors. This film is so simple and has such depth. It's so real. I know I will watch many more times.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Lost in Translation,"Lost in Translation
A faded movie star and a neglected young woman form an unlikely bond after crossing paths in Tokyo.Two Lost Souls Met in Tokyo was enough for me to go for it as The Third Lost Soul, it's also directed by Sofia Coppola which is a big plus obviously.I love Japan, especially Tokyo, I find it captivating particularly back in the 90s in Tokyo Vice, a series by HBO that I watched lately, Tokyo is stunning in this movie too in the early 20's, it's a small detail, but it really makes a difference to me.Talking about the movie, it was slow-paced for the whole time, you just have to go with the flow and watch those two crazy lost guys, get to know each other, and have fun, It also makes you wonder what if you were in their place, what would you do!I think I'll never have the answer because having a new fun relationship with someone in a different country, the kind of fun and happiness you've never had in your normal daily life, looks far from happening and if it ever happened, I don't think it would last long.However, this movie can show you that choosing your partner isn't a simple mission, you may end up unlocking new dimensions, and new things are always more interesting, but you should manage to make it last, find something to love about the life you've already chosen, and you just can't simply get away from, here you'll find peace that can make your own happiness.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

lost in boredom,"What a let down this movie was. I was expecting this great story since it was nominated for so many awards.  And it totally sucked.  Awful, boring, stupid.  And what is all this praise for Bill Murray in this.  It was not great acting. IT was just a toned down, unfunny Bill Murray. There was hardly any range to his character considering all he does is shoot alcohol commericals and follow Charlotte around in Tokoyo.  Clearly this movie got hype because of who Sofia's daddy was.  Her other film Virgin Suicides was much better.FINAL VERDICT:  This was terrible. I barely stayed awake. Do not bother watching it.",,Anonymous,Comedy

Found In Japan,"Once upon a time as a young woman, Sopia Coppola no doubt visited Japan and was very lonely there. The two main characters, Bob Harris (very well acted by Bill Murray) and Charlotte (well acted by Scarlett Johannsen) find themselves in Japan in the midst of a midlife crisis (Bob) and a life transition (Charlotte). Each is finding life meaningless and confusing which is compounded by their Japanese setting. (It IS a hard language to master, it is a difficult cultue to relate to, and all of those little gifts the Japanese keep pressing on us -- just about bore us to death.) The pace of their developing friendship and the use of music lyrics to portray what they are feeling is masterful. The first image we see is the behind of a woman with her ""groove thing"" showing though a pair of gauzy pink panties. This movie will have sex (and sex sells). Yes, there is a little sex, but not what you think, and that was a nice surprise. It was a great look at Tokyo (esp. Ginza district) and Kyoto, with vignettes of Japanese night life and pop culture (such as pachinko, arcade games, karaoke and an inane talk show). But there were too many jabs about the Japanese substituting ""L"" for ""R"" -- ""lock and loll"" for rock and roll, ""lip"" for rip, etc.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Sublime,"Everything in this movie are remarkable, the scenes, dialogues, music and characters!

I hope I can do it someday!Funfact:
NOBODY KNOWS FOR SURE WHAT BOB SAID TO CHARLOTTE IN THE END.Some digital processing performed by curious Internet folk have drawn different conclusions. Some versions indicate that Bob tells Charlotte to tell her husband John ""the truth."" In the script, Coppola wrote Bob's line as, ""I know, I'm going to miss you, too.""

Not Cassavetes...,"Okay...I understand the genre, have internationally traveled etc. etc. etc., and I can relate to most if not all the criticisms as well as some of the praise here.One thing I will say is that the critics seem to have it and in this case clearly explain their boredom much better and to a greater extent than the yaysayers who explain that the rest of us just don't get it etc. etc. and I have to wonder without all the great connections Sofia Coppola has...would this film ever had been made?This is not the Godfather and to have even put her in the same league as her old man is insulting to what he did. What I will say in praise though, is that this does not seem a sophomoric effort at film-making. The ""Virgin Suicides"" did not either and was more fascinating for me, though this certainly does not lose merit.One of the top 250 of all time rated here, however? Was there anything groundbreaking in this work except the fact that she made boredom much more beautiful than say Todd Haynes ""Safe?"" Outside of the wildly imaginative reviews that see something so deep inside this that cause others to go ""say what?"" I found it also boring.Yes I know much of life is, but it has been represented in much better, and thought out ways (or with no forethought perhaps at all), at least for my opinion and review, like in the works of Alan Ball in ""American Beauty,"" or his new HBO series ""Six feet under,"" or the works of John Cassavetes in which my favorite, ""A Woman under the influence,"" had so much potential to make us look at life's boring aspects and remind Hollywood ""uh hello-you do want us to pay for this right?""Sometimes it's a matter of something on which we cannot put our finger. All we can say is ""this was dull, boring and/or I don't/didn't like it."" On this level, I can say that at least Cassavetes created characters we the viewers cared about (and remember Hollywood didn't always see him in the light he is viewed today...)Coppola created characters here that a lot of viewers eventually came to loathe.For example, Murray's character was seen as ""boo-hoo, I'm so bored here earning my crummy 2 million dollars...,"" where at least Johansson had an excuse...Still, most people rather than allow themselves to feel trapped in a foreign land might at least try to get out and understand the culture and experience a little beyond trying to make everything their own and look for the nearest McDonald's (which is pretty damn disgusting in its own right) as one reviewer observed.No, I did not expect young Miss Coppola to make this for my sake nor Hollywood's and though I find it all political, I have to wonder if this was part of her purpose and therefore brilliant, i.e. did she want to choose and create characters with whom we would find utter disgust by the film's end? Again, in referring to Cassavetes, at least by the movie's end, we had empathy and cared about the characters, even if we did not relate to them.Here all we could think was ""when is he going to jump this hot young thing's bones?"" Well maybe this was just my observation...and clichéd or not, it certainly would have made things more interesting and real since both characters were up for a good roll...If you want reality with flair, take a look somewhere else like in ""American Movie"" or ""American Splendor."" (hey, what the heck..three movies with ""American"" at the forefront..!). If you want to fall asleep and see until that point what all the fuss was about, take a look at this fish out of water, and groundbreaking or not on fronts, it was still like a mouthful of barium chalk. ""Sedative out of water"" would have been a much better title for this work.I hope she creates people we can at least care about in the next one, because all I wanted to do was see Murray crashing through the skyscraper window with about as much enthusiasm as I can muster, like Julianne Moore's character's head into a wall in ""Safe.""Of course that's just me. I expect to at least be entertained for my $7.50...",,Anonymous,Comedy
A heart-warming movie with a great sense of meaning,"SkullBallMovies review of Lost in Translation:I watch movies to have a new experience, to enjoy the time watching it, and to get a feel of how I want to make a living in the future involving movies.

I have had struggles with finding myself and one line in the movie was completely true to me. 'The more you know who you are, and what you want, the less you let things upset you.' I've found myself recently and I know that if I saw this movie before I did, it would have changed me completely. This movie still greatly impacted me and I love it.

One Of The Many Contemporary Goods,"I love contemporary movies.The reason I liked ""Lost in Translation"" was because the movie wasn't explained to me rather than shown to me. The movie was an experience rather than an explanation. An adventure film in the city, ""Lost in Translation"" was the contemporary start to the revolution of modern humanistic film-making in 2004, which resembled films like ""Sidways"" and ""The Door in the Floor."" More relative to ""Sidways"" this movie is also good because of the exploration of Japan, exploration of Bill Murray's confusion, and de-sensitized involvement in the characters of Bill Murray and Scarlet Johansson.The things that are evolving more so in acting quality and human screenplay in these recent years is the realism of acting, and subtle feelings delivered to viewers.These recent years have shown us that special effects and virtually new films aren't required for cinematic artistry.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Nice, but not great","I've just seen the movie and it was fun but didn't moved me.The movie is about homesickness and not much more. It is a bit predictable and nothing much happens, but maybe that was the directors intention: to present just a bit of the characters' lives, without a very deep analysis.The best of all were the actors. More than half of the merit is theirs, especially if they, as I've read, improvised some of the dialogues. I also liked some scenes very much, but a sum of beautiful scenes is not necessarily a beautiful movie.""Lost in translation"" reminded me a lot of Doris Dörrie's ""Erleuchtung garantiert"" (Enlightenment Guaranteed) in many aspects (first of all, the setting, and the general feeling, too). The problem is that Dörrie's film was made in 2000, and the story is so much better than ""Lost in translation"". At least for me, this movie arrived too late. If you enjoyed Coppola's one, try the other one, even if you find it too similar, and you'll see it's far more complex and fresh.My impression, with all due respect, is that Sofia Coppola can afford to make movies because of her last name. I'm not sure that people would be thrilled about her movies if she weren't Francis Ford Coppola's relative. In my opinion, if I think of ""Virgin suicides"" (movie that, BTW, I hate, it bored me to death; I didn't get it at all), she is making progress: this is a richer movie, with more flavored dialogues and more round characters. But I don't know if that is enough to win awards. But she is young. Maybe, with time, she'll come to make the sort of movies at least I love.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Are our two subjects soulmates?,"I don't have much to add to the top reviews; they're really excellent, especially ""Didn't get it at first, then 15 years later I totally got it"" (8 stars) and ""Lost Souls"" (9 stars).The ACHE that these two (lost/lonely) people feel when they realize the power of their bond, and how they're both probably too far gone and/or committed to change course is SO well done here. It's powerful and happy/sad (I don't think ""poignant"" is the right word). Their (brief) friendship transcends their age difference. What they feel and share is more than affection; it's sadly muted love.It seems to me that this movie touches on Existentialism, given how lost our main characters feel. There's no evidence either feels any great purpose in life. However, there are probably MANY sub-themes at play here. This movie would be good for school essays.While this movie might be a poster child for why ""slow burn"" movies are made, the pacing isn't ideal; I think slightly more aggressive editing would have helped. But Bill Murray and ScarJo are fantastic, and the ending couldn't be more appropriate*. I think this movie will stay with me for a long, long time. It's sublime.I give this eight (8) stars. My hat's off to writer/director Sofia Coppola.* Avoiding spoilers, there's an ""ambiguous element"" to the ending. It's hard not to think about it later, and experimentally fill in some details.

Perfection,"Lost in Translation's real power comes in its ability to elicit such a range of emotions from its audience whilst remaining so subtle in everything it does. At once beautiful, tragic, heart warming and funny, it is underscored by a wonderful soundtrack, spectacular cinematography and magnetic performances from its two leads.Bob and Charlotte are two people lost in the maze of their own lives. The feeling of isolation from their true selves is perfectly reflected in Tokyo's alien culture, people and surroundings. The film is set at a perfect pace, which allows you to consider what may have come before. You are able to mull over how their lives have panned out up to their chance encounter in Tokyo and therefore untangle their respective emotional messes. There is no judgement present in Copolla's script or direction, and none is expected of the audience.LiT is in the same class as Before Sunrise in its achievement of developing an intense relationship between two strangers over a very short space of time – Copolla replaces Vienna with Tokyo as the postcard backdrop. Comparing the two films is made all the more interesting by the vastly different styles. Where Linklater used almost all dialogue in developing the relationship, Copolla is sparse with hers – relying more on shared experiences and on two characters being in exactly the same place in their lives, despite the generational divide.It's difficult to see any other actors pulling off the roles of Bob and Charlotte. By many accounts, Murray is effectively playing himself, despite being somewhat against type. Johannson was just 18 at the time of filming – making the emotional depth she conveys quite extraordinary. Lost in Translation really is flawless.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Sterile and pretentious,"Are you familiar with the agony of having to confront most of your friends with your (very) negative assessment of a movie everyone loves? It never hit me so hard as with Lost in Translation, a sad monument to vanity and contempt. Two aspects of that film made it particularly unpleasant: the use of clichés, and the very poor tailoring of scenes.I suppose the foggy poetry of the title explains the distance with which everything is filmed, and the particularly painful impression that everything taking place on the screen is in fact happening behind a bullet-proof window. Every time something a little significant threatens to occur (physical or verbal contact between the two main characters, a twist in the plot...), the scene is cut short. Now I very well understand that this may be considered a rather clever technique, and I can appreciate the understated aesthetics of it all, but this is going too far, and turns into a farce: we're asked to PRETEND that something meaningful is taking place between the scenes, or inside the character's heads. What a fraud.Now back to the multitude of clichés that are used throughout the movie, particularly to depict the Japanese, cultural and everyday Japan, but also show-business relationships, what happens after 20 years of marriage, expatriates, the shallow side of young and successful Americans, etc. This is a feature that many people commended, arguing that it was a rather subtle, elegant and ironic treatment of the issue of cultural shock in particular and inter-cultural contact in general. I only see contempt for the world at large, a very crude perception and rendering of other human beings, and a terribly self-indulgent narration technique. No effort of understanding each snapshot, nor any attempt to brush an overall picture: what was the point?!All in all, I did not enjoy this movie. Except during the very rare moments of humor (""for relaxing time, make it Suntory time""), it was not pleasant at all to watch. 1/10",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Overrated Tale of Loneliness,"In Tokyo, Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is a bored middle-age famous movie star filming a commercial of a whisky for two millions dollars. Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) is a bored and lonely wife of a photographer lodged in the same hotel as Bob. Together, they find the company of each other to supersede their loneliness in a foreigner country, and their proximity becomes in friendship and repressed love. 'Lost in Translation' is a sensitive movie, with a great performances of Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson. The direction is precise and secure and the screenplay is quite original. The situation of Bob and Charlotte is very easy to be understood, if the viewer has had the experience of working expatriated alone in a country in the Orient, where the language, culture, behavior and social customs and habits are totally different from the Occident. He certainly will miss his family, sometimes will feel bored and confused, most of the times will have difficulties even to order the meals. I found 'Lost in Translation' a beautiful, romantic and melancholic uncommon American film, since it looks like an European movie, but overrated, maybe because of the name of Sofia Coppola.

"A Beautiful, Funny and Human Story","This is a movie for thinking. After you watch it, you keep thinking about it, about it's characters, about Japan... It's truly a funny and beautiful story about a famous actor who is in Japan for the promotion of a whisky and a girl who's married with a job-obsessed person. They cross with each other a few times in the hotel they're living and one day they start talking to each other, creating a very deep bond between them.This is a movie about humans, talking about their feelings, the way it feels to be abroad in a far away country, how they get along with each other and so. Here the main characters are played by Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson. They're both perfect in their roles. Bill Murray has this feeling of a sad person who wants to make everybody to smile. And Scarlett (in of her younger and better roles I have seen) gives an emotional performance, giving a feeling of innocence but also a person who feels she doesn't fit in the world around her, but when she gets with Bill Murray they both feel like they're in home.One of the best things of the movie is the way it captures the feeling of being in Tokyo, with some moments being filmed almost like a documentary film, taking you to all the different kind of things you can find in this city. And other of the great things is the soundtrack, an awesome collection of music that makes you fly to this Japanese city.Overall, this a movie about human persons, so if you're looking for an action packed film without any substance, you can skip this one, but if you're looking for a movie that talks about humans and tells a beautiful story with some hints of comedy, you'll love this one.

A Good Movie With Some Great Moments. Visually Interesting With Little Dialog.,"To really understand this movie, you need to have had a vacation romance, or a 'summer fling', or met someone in a random airport bar, or met someone at camp as a teenager, or any other romance that was predestined to be temporary. Being in a foreign environment makes us emotionally vulnerable. When you connect with someone it seems extra special because you are in this special place under these special circumstances. Because it's temporary, you never get a chance to see the other person's flaws or shortcomings. A stranger can become an intimate companion in a matter of days. And, then they say goodbye.In my opinion, this movie gets a lot of things wrong. But, the one it REALLY gets right is the goodbye. The goodbye is always awkward. It's so hard. You never know what to say, because there is nothing to say that will ever make it less difficult. Sometimes you want to just avoid the goodbye, altogether - which is probably worse. At the end of the day, it doesn't really matter. Whether you ghost someone on the last day or you share an emotional goodbye in your final moments together, your heart gets ripped out either way.Despite all of the things that I might have found irritating about this film, Sophia Coppola created a sexy film with great shots of Japan, and she filmed a near perfect 'travel romance goodbye sequence'.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

No Translation Necessary{spoilers possible},"At least there was none needed for me,as I thought this film was a pleasant,thoughtful and intelligent study in characters.Bob Harris(Bill Murray,reaching a new frontier in his long career:that of the quietly despairing middle-aged white male)is completely out of his element. He is alone,on a commercial shoot in Tokyo. He knows no one there,keeps to himself and drinks to fill the voids. He is an actor who(we are to deduce)at one time had a much more successful career,but he's making the best of things now. He is separated from his family and probably would feel a disconnect from them even if he weren't separated by an ocean and hemisphere.Charlotte(Scarlett Johanssen,matching the character descript almost to a T)is married to a photographer(Giovanni Ribisi,not really in much of the picture)and her reason for being in the Land of the Rising Sun is fairly simple:her husband is doing a long and extensive photo shoot there and he wants her along. Of course,he doesn't bring her along for his work,and it gives her plenty of time to stay in her hotel room and get bored. She's married young,and(we are also led to believe)she feels like maybe she's done the wrong thing,as much as she loves her husband. Also lonely,unable to speak a word of Japanese and restless,she roams the Hotel to break the monotony.This is how our two main characters meet,and through their meeting,they develop a sort of bonding that's just short of sexual and a little past emotional. To call this an ""Affair of the Heart"" might be over-simplified,but it seems like it might be the closest thing to what is at play here. As the movie progresses,the two understand each other and become quietly pushed to make a decision about that.Very solid acting performances,great imagery(I was in Tokyo once,over twenty-five years ago,and although it was for a very short time,one could get a sense that they were dwarfed in that city even for a short stay!)and a smart,seamless direction and script from capable director Sofia Coppola make this movie unique and valuable. This is strictly a talking,seeing and feeling movie,so people with no patience for pure character studies need not apply.

Then, the title appears and we begin to go on a ride that we have never been on before. Whether this is your kind of ride, the journey is well worth it. Some kind of an art house film, Coppola escapes this dangerous idea by rapping the film up nicely enough to give her audience a treat. The ending finds its moral and makes everything worth wild.

Pictures of empty, rumple beds and evacuated rooms where only a distant sound of a buzzing shaver is indicating human presence.Unfortunately those are rare moments, like I said. The film expects more than just the old-fashioned, simple camera work of Lance Acord. And in some scenes Coppola uses cheapest stereotyped ideas of the modern Japanese culture (gambling houses, karaoke) which is quite annoying.What remains are some wonderful, wonderful cinematic moments and a great Bill Murray who should be set in serious roles more often.",,Anonymous,Comedy

Beautiful,"I saw this movie for the first time a few days ago. It's simply the best movie I've seen in years. It presented something that few other movies have--I saw something profoundly moving in it that's really (sorry for the cliché) beyond words.The producer and writer, Sofia Coppola, skillfully captured something here about relationships that usually goes unspoken. It is a poignant look at a relationship between two people who find joy in each others company while they are isolated in a foreign culture. Ms. Coppola and her crew created a film that evoked a great deal of empathy from me and watching it was an intensely affective experience. These two very real characters and their warm relationship is set off against a beautiful (and beautifully filmed and scored) but foreign landscape which, at times, takes on a sterility that amplifies the isolation of the two main characters--strangers in a strange land.An adjective that comes to mind for this film is 'reality'. It seems to leave behind Hollywood predictability and insightfully looks at a deeper, more real level of human relationships. I hope Ms. Coppola can exercise her insight again and present movie-goers with an equally affective and 'real' movie as this one.If you've ever traveled and formed bonds along the way with people you've met, this movie is a striking window into that experience.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Slow Boat To Tokyo,"First things first. I expected to like this film, and I did like it. But it was not the event I had hoped for. Normally I take to these sedately-paced stories of human emotion and art-house-type presentation. The whole thing is just so painfully slow, however, and I really can't see how it can have attracted such high praise. The direction, scenery and music are all good. And yet there is nothing strong enough about the central characters to make them dominate a slow movie. I certainly admire Scarlett Johansson, having watched her emerge in both 'The Man Who Wasn't There' and the wonderful 'Ghost World'. Unfortunately, in this role, she doesn't quite have the presence to pull off the impossible - that is, make something of a character who seems to have no real soul. Bill Murray, although I still don't like him, is capable, but I found him miscast. This movie needed a Nicholson or a Hoffman, but I know they're too old now. Where have all the young gifted actors disappeared to? I rate this movie 5 out of 10, and cannot fathom why the critics are foaming at their mouths. It does have great 'bits' but there are far too many meaningless slow periods. My favourite bit was the golf drive, which seemed to be heading for the volcano. Even this shot was out of context and performed for effect. I was half expecting some sub-title to tell me that this was meaningful. Worth watching on a rainy day, but wait for it to be free.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Yet Another One of Those...,"Another pedestrian take on one man's mid-life crisis associated with a young woman's ennui.Granted, this is a well-crafted movie. Impeccable acting, great cinematography, good pace... Effective in communicating said ennui but lacking in subtlety, depth, breadth, or interesting human characters. Nominally set in Japan to serve as an excuse for arbitrary beautiful images, but representing a strong ""Western"" penchant for self-absorption.The two main characters have a conspicuously pseudo-romantic relationship (""Oh! Do they love each other? In which way?"") which evacuates anything around them, including Charlotte's husband (""Is he cheating on her?"") and Bob's wife (conveniently absent from the scene). Every character, including the main ones, is a one-dimensional ""faire-valoir"" for a fairly provincial feeling of displacement.Altogether, an inward-looking gaze at boredom and closed-mindedness.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One of the few perfect films,"Lost in Translation either works or it doesn't work for you - and for many people it's a bargain for somewhere in between. It can be seen as a drama, and in many venues it was billed as a comedy - but for a certain segment of the audience it is I believe a profoundly moving and devastating story about an impossible love, told with simplicity and attention to detail; and with such careful modulation that the ground shakes during it's final moments.The criticism I've heard leveled at the film most often is that it dwells on the problems of the 'super rich', when the film isn't about that. The fact that these characters are from this background was the only way Coppola could tell this story in earnest; these characters are extensions of herself, and like it or not she was born into this kind of world. The purpose of the story isn't to evoke sympathy for the problems in these people's lives - rather, there's a universality to this idea that no matter where we are in this world, no matter how well things are going in our lives, we all have the ability to feel stranded. And no matter how stranded we feel in our lives, when the light of a human connection finds us it has the potential to illuminate our entire being.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
An ordinary episode of global commuters,"Have you ever been accosted by strangers of your opposite sex when taking international public transport, let say airplane, train or boat, especially when there are only a few people of your skin colour or language? Exchanging business card, having drinks after office hour... romantic encounters, so to speak.  In actuality, ""Lost in translation"" is ever-playing on this world stage of intensifying human mobility.Linguistic knowledge, nationality and age are determining factors of a viewer's opinions and feeling to this movie.  Catharsis cannot show me its smug smile because personally I know some Japanese and German, besides, both Asian and Western ideas are not unfamiliar to me.  Regretfully, even if I were in Charlotte or Bob's shoes, I would not feel anything too annoying.  I am not lost in translation, anyway.  Perhaps, if the setting is changed to: Asians, Chisinau (Moldova), I may have empathy.What I like the most about the movie is how the characters deal with their growing feeling to each other.  What they do is closer to reality.  I never believe that all frequent business travellers are so lustful that they cannot control their hormonal drive when they are in another country as some movies so ""vividly"" depict.  In a way, it reminds me how people maturely deal with their out-of-wedlock relationship, namely Peter Chan's ""Comrades: Almost a Love Story"", Kar-wai Wong's ""In the Mood for Love"" and Ulu Grosbard's ""Falling in love"".  The ending though carries the air of that of ""Roman Holiday"", yet I do think, despite the age disparity, Charlotte and Bob can be friends when they return home.  How can an ordinary journalist see a princess whenever he wishes?Among the 690 comments, someone says it's boring.  Yes, it is, ordinary life somehow is boring.

making great movies is in her genes,"Sofia Coppola,daugther of legendary director Francis Ford Coppola made a very impressive debut with Lost In Translation. Even though this is her first movie you can clearly see he is completely in control. The performances from Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanson were brilliant and the storyline was exceptional. Lost In Translation tells the story of an actor(Bill Murray)who goes to Japan to star in a couple of ads. He ends up in the same hotel as Scarlett Johanson who is on holiday with her husband,it is clearly obvious from the first scene that she is neglected by him. They meet in a bar one night and there is instantly a connection. Not a sexual one, more of a father-daugther one. In my opinion Bill Murray is trying to compensate for not being there for his own kids by being like a father to her. In the scene where Murray insists that Scarlett goes to the hospital to get something on her foot checked out is a great example. Then they go to see all the sights around Japan and that forms the rest of the story. To top it up all the movie is laced with funny instances that don't looked forced but is more natural. At the end of the movie there is a famous scene where they are hugging and they are saying something that is rather muffled. I don't know why but the movie struck a chord with me, I can't remember the last time I saw a movie where I got emotionally involved. LIT is a completely fulfilling experience about strangers spending time in a country that is alien to them.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Truly fine film--except for that pesky boom mic.!,"This film is unique in many ways.  What I liked most is the effect that has lingered with me since I saw the movie last week.  It's a feeling that I was in Japan with some people I got to know--but now that I'm home I miss them and wish I got to know them better.  So much was said without dialogue: A smile, a glance, a yawn.  Both the leads were perfect.  Not flawless characters, but real and likeable people.But why the boom mic in so many scenes?  Was everything done in one take? Couldn't the tops of the shots be cropped?  Did nobody notice?This came sooo close to being a perfect movie.  But that intrusive, pesky boom forced me to give Lost in Translation a ""7"".I truly hope things will be cleaned-up for the director's cut.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Two hours gone from my life that I will never get back,"I am an introvert who has felt longing and sought meaning, but I still found this film boring. Like so many films, it started out alright. There were some funny parts, like when Bill Murray was trying to use the exercise machine. Then the film died, and we had to stare at its corpse for an hour. Did they really have to show every performance at the karaoke? Talk about a scene that should have ended up on the cutting room floor! I would rather have watched paint dry.In response to another reviewer: No, I am not a die-hard Disney or Sci-fi addict. I do not need explosions, guns, CGI effects, or rampant sex. There is no way I am going to sit down and watch this film again. Forget it. I am in touch with my feelings. I am deeply sensitive. As far as how westerners view Japan, please speak for yourself.

If you want a movie to play in the background of a funeral or lulling a baby to sleep, this is your movie. I understand the idea but it was executed horribly. If you want a movie with actual drama about marriage, watch Marriage Story.

A truly transcendent movie experience to touch your soul (or not),"At work we just made our top 10 movies of all time lists and my usual faves all figured (Star Wars, American Beauty, Matrix, Forrest Gump, Lord of the Rings, The Sound of Music, Back to the Future, Being John Malkovich), but then I remembered this movie, which I haven't seen for ages, but it had to be the one, above all others because it just touched me in a more profound sense. In fact, this movie transcends all the usual criteria, (plot, script, acting, cinematography etc.)Although those aspects are actually stunning, there is something else, which goes beyond those things that completely nails it for me personally. Some people say they just don't get it or that it's boring because nothing happens, but maybe it's just that they just don't relate to the mood of the film, which is cool. Everybody is different after all. Personally, I'm a sucker for melancholy, self-indulgent slush that lets me wallow in self-pity. I seek it out and gorge myself upon it ;P , But seriously, I yearn to get far away from all the bullshit and find some space where I can really get in touch with my real thoughts and feelings, and totally find myself. Then, to find a genuine connection with a like spirit, that is totally safe........Well, it's a dream I have. Maybe this is the closest I'm gonna get. I hope not, but in the meantime, I wouldn't give a 10 for any other movie I've seen.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Superb,"I was wondering what all the fuss was about this film but after seeing it i see why. Its a nice film that makes a change to see. I'm sick and tired of the standard Hollywood turd movies that get made. But this is special. The cinematography is beautiful as said and makes Japan look an amazing place.Firstly i guess if you don't like Bill Murray then you wont like the movie. Scarlet Johanson is stunning, beautiful and lost in Japan with bill Murray.There's nothing more to the film than two people being lost. what can you do when you are lost? you can try and move on or you can stay put. At one point in life we all feel lost and this film is just showing two people lost or trapped in lives they realize they don't want anymore. Scenes of Scarlet Johanson's character looking out into the city OK Tokiyo are amazing and show the loneliness of being away from home in a big city.I must admit i couldn't take my eyes of Scarlet Johanson she really was stunning, captivating. This is what makes the movie work is the chemistry between the two. They know they like each other but are afraid to make the next move, afraid to change their lives.I loved this movie and its one the best films I've seen in the last year. Some people wont like it and thats there loss but it really is a wonderful film. Its great to see a film so refreshing and new make it.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Bill Murray, Scarlett Johansson and Sofia Coppola -  perfect combination","Bill Murray's best performance, Scarlett Johansson's debut to fame and equally brilliant performance and Sofia Coppola's top notch and unique directing really make this movie worthwhile. I was mostly impressed with Sofia's directing, camera angles and truly breathtaking and brilliant screenplay. It's not very often you get shots as good as these in movies.This is a story about two people, an old, washed up actor Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and a twenty-five year old woman, Charlotte, (Scarlett Johansson) both in Tokyo in the same luxurious hotel. Bob is being payed 2 million dollars for a commercial and photo shoot to promote his whiskey, when he could be at home with his wife and kids doing a play, while Charlotte has been dragged along by her husband who is mostly away on business doing celebrity photographing. When they both meet, they click immediately. They both explore and try to fit in with the Japanese culture and mingle with friends of Charlotte's.With a huge gap of age difference and both of them married (though Bob is somewhat estranged from his wife and kids) they form a relationship that is much stronger than physical aspects. They share a mutual understanding of the confusion of both their private lives and the difficulty of trying to adapt themselves to a foreign place.A young woman trying to find her place in life and an older man past his prime, looking for something he used to have. Many people can relate to these characters, and that's what I love about movies. You feel the realness of their situations. This film is like American Beauty set in Japan. It lifts you high up from the ground and you'll want to remember the journey, and the message it sends.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Over-rated movie about nothing,"The only thing truly great about this movie are the reviews. The movie itself is artsy-fartsy and lacks a storyline - it has no beginning, no end, no crisis, and no resolution. It has funny moments, lonely moments, tranquil moments, but no story to support these moments.  The cinematography is okay, and the acting is not particularly demanding - how hard can it be to sit in a bar and say nothing? Or to lay in bed and say nothing?  Or to stare out a window and say nothing.  A mannequin can act the part just as well.  For cinematography and a unique cultural experience, I give this movie 6/10 stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I don't normally do emotional movies.,"I don't normally do emotion led movies.  I'm vastly more a pixar, or Naked gun, or even Tomb Raider kind of person.  The likes of Big Fish are usually about my limit.I watched this because it looked from the trailer like it would be quiet funny and because I had a feeling Bill Murray would be 100% brilliant.I was right on one of these counts.  Bill Murray is right on top of his game here.  Right from the start I never doubted for half a second that he WAS Bob Harris.  He makes Scarlett Johansson look almost average which is grossly unfair on her for a very good performance.This movie is not funny.  Most would even find it dull (and in parts of the middle I would consider agreeing with them) but it has become one of the few movies of this type I not only enjoyed but which actively moved me which is astoundingly difficult to do.I'm not claiming it's perfect and fans of this type of movie may not even consider it one of the better ones but coming from the outside I loved it and would recommend it to anyone who ""wouldn't normally watch something like this"".",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Some good, some bad, all-in-all not the movie of the year","After watching this movie, I had a feeling of confusion.  I thought to myself, ""is this really the great piece of American film work that everyone is talking about?""  Personally, I do not think that this is one of those top 10 movies.  The movie had a very low-key tone that, at times, felt long and boring.  I was a little befuddled about Charlotte and Bob's relationship as by the end as throughout the movie it seems to waver. But its a unique relationship and its a little refreshing to see something a little different, one based on shared boredom and loneliness.  However, its frustrating at the same time because you cannot figure out what direction they are taking next.Besides from that, you can really relate to their loneliness throughout the entire movie.  I had a little added enjoyment because of my experiences in Japanese class where I had to listen to my teacher babble in Japanese and every once in a while speak in broken English.  In this respect I can REALLY relate to the characters.  The background shots of Tokyo are well done and add to the tone of being lost in a crowd and alone.  Also, Bill Murray fits the part of Bob like a glove and was enjoyable to watch.Although this movie was beautifully made, its not particularly exciting and is in need of some direction as it just feels flat throughout.  I give it 6.5/10 since it was professionally made, but really falls short in terms of a great/interesting story.  Maybe on a second run-through, I might appreciate more things.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Humorous Coppola !!,"Lost in Translation (2003) is about Bob, an aging movie star, and Charlotte, the wife of a photographer, who both feel loneliness in the bewildering environment of Tokyo and who gradually come to understand each other and be good friends at last.The film is obviously personal for writer and director Sofia Coppola, who spent time in Tokyo several years ago working in photography and fashion. Her other works are Lick the Star (1998) and The Virgin Suicides (1999).Some reviewers have criticized this movie for making fun of the Japanese inability to pronounce English words correctly, often confusing R and L sounds. Probably some of these critics feel that they are being made fun of by Coppola, but the director used what is obviously true for humorous effect. While I feel that Coppola is not mocking the Japanese, it would have better if she had Bob and Charlotte trying to understand Japanese and speak a bit of Japanese while in Japan. Other critics say Coppola makes fun of the tiny Japanese with scenes of Bob towering over a crowd of Japanese in elevator and using a shower that is too low, but Coppola only represents reality directly and humorously.Regarding Japanese culture, Charlotte confusion about Ikebana and shrines is an expression of what Coppola felt when she first came to Japan. It is hardly surprising that foreigners find Japanese culture eluding because even Japanese do not understand everything about our own culture.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

'Lost in Translation' left me cold. I found it to be dull and uninspiring. The characters are wooden and emotionless.

As I had read some goods comments, I supposed, after having seen the firsts scenes, that at any moment a sudden change should became interesting the situation. Far from it. One wanted to flee a screen where the characters are unable to communicate between themselves; where the scenes (all of them we can easily do without) follow one another any old how. We see two hollows persons. Nothing else. There is not even friendship, rebelliousness or tenderness. That's why I didn't feel neither compassion nor interest.

Brilliant!,"I usually hate it when I see someone give something a perfect review. Let's face it, most people who do so are what videogamers call ""fanboys"". Maybe I am guilty of this in regards to this movie, but I simply can't help it. This movie is absolutely brilliant. I have never seen a better portrayal of a ""slice of life."" But this movie is so much more. The fact that Bill Murray was beaten at the Oscars is mere politics. He was clearly the better actor. While this is only Ms. Coppola's second venture into directing, it is nothing short of amazing and visionary.What first struck me about the film was the amazing cinematography. The visuals of Tokyo in the second scene are breathtaking. And they don't stop there. The visual flair of this film does such a wonderful job of making you feel right at home in this almost alien existence. Japan is vastly different from the United States and as told in the story, so is it told in the imagery.As for the story, again brilliant. This story is solely told in the characters. These are real people and not cookie cutter performances. You believe their portrayals and find some kind of understanding with them. You can empathize with both Bob Harris (Bill Murrary) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansen) in many ways. If nothing else, you at least get a sense of what it must feel like to be foreigners in such a different world. Beyond that, these are real people who have real problems. And with that, we feel close to them and feel their anxieties. Don't expect to get some kind of closure or big happy ending. This movie ends things like they end in real life. It isn't a tragedy, it isn't cathartic. It just ends.I only wish this film would have come out in a different year. For it to be up against such fierce competition for 2003 was totally unfair. This movie was a sleeper hit and with the build up of the ""Lord of the Rings"" over three years, it was almost unfair to pit it up against such a mammoth undertaking. Regaurdless, as a film, this is the better of the two (or all of the Oscar picks for that matter). I cannot recommend this movie enough. But if this is a sign of things to come from Ms. Coppola, we have a great deal to look forward to.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Gently as the cherry blossom falls from the trees on the slopes of Mount Fuji we watch a story develop of the kind of love non-affair between two people judged beautifully by the the actors and Sofia Coppola of which we could say, 'That was right.' And the music is mixed into the scenes to paint the kind of tone poem/pictures that meld seamlessly into the film.Perhaps ten minutes too long otherwise near perfection.Johannsen seemingly has little to do but appear desirable but she matches Bill Murray's subtle portrait of ennui and isolation with her growing sense of detachment from her husband and their slowly, delicately dance of curiosity and desire.Beatific pacing.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Lost in Translation (2003) - I'm Lost in Japan! I Can't Understand a Word!,"Sofia Coppola writes and directs a tale of being lost, and how to come back to life with ""Lost in Translation"". Now, the story was interesting because it was brilliantly written and casted, and Sofia Coppola really brought a charm and a unique charisma to a story that involves friendship and fixing our life around. But to me it was just another well-written feature, and it just does not contain a real heart to the story, but the cast of Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson created a well-known chemistry together. But even with great chemistry, writing, casting, and an imagination by the daughter of the 'Godfather' director, the film was kind of losing heart, and it was impossible to search for the love, but the message of the movie was uplifting. Anyways, the movie was kind of funny, but most of it was really trying to make me think that the movie was more like a comedy, instead of a heartfelt drama. The film does have its moments, and the Coppolas never disappoint. ""Lost in Translation"", in my review, ""imaginative writing, but loss of heart"".",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Slow, boring, empty","This movie really has nothing redeeming.  The acting is fine, but nothing is demanded of the actors.  The movie is filled with mundane conversation, (e.g. ""'where are you from?' - long pause - 'New York'"") and already dated cultural slapstick ""humor"".It is basically the story of a slow, uninteresting, and depressing intergenerational romance, except without any compelling dialogue or believable interactions.  We are forced to watch the inside of Tokyo night clubs and late night apartment karaoke - scenes which interesting only if you have spent the last 10 years reading Chaucer in a coffee shop.

Dubious haiku,"Lost in Translation is about the absurdity of failed communication. Faxes and long-distance calls substitute for actual exchange. Bill Murray, an over-it actor in Tokyo to make a whiskey ad, strains to articulate his need for change to his wife, a hectoring voice more interested in scolding Murray than in listening to him. Scarlett Johansson calls an American friend, wanting to convey her bewilderment at being abandoned by her husband - he is away on a fashion shoot - in a strange city. Tears rolling down her cheeks, she fumbles for words: oblivious, her friend excuses herself, with a rejoinder to ""Call me when you get back.""It is funny, then, that the film should be so reserved. It reminded me of haikus, three-line poems that set a concrete image next to some larger idea or feeling. The reader draws the connections, makes the meaning. As Johansson wanders among women arranging flowers, or later, tours Kyoto, there is no obvious narrative end to the scenes. Often they are wordless. We are taken on a mini-tour of Tokyo as a foreigner without any language might encounter it. Johansson is our escort, unobtrusive yet intended to make our own reactions more acute. In Kyoto, she watches a traditional wedding: this reverberates with our knowledge of Johansson's ambivalent feelings toward her own marriage. This is directorial shorthand, a dubious haiku  feelings are rarely dramatised, but gently evoked. I would gladly have exchanged the lightness of touch for some conflict, a story.The director, Sofia Coppola, has described the film as a love-letter to Tokyo. It is a fairly ambivalent Valentine. We have a hoary old routine while Murray is making his whiskey ad: the director gives him long, emphatic instructions in his native tongue, which an assistant then translates in two or three words. (The film goes in for soft comic targets  there is little wit in the treatment of a blond starlet who sings off-key karaoke and talks at length about Hollywood diets. She is meant to serve as contrast to Johansson, but really Johansson is not much more articulate.) We are meant to smile at Tokyo's sweetly misguided idea of Western culture. An escort is sent to Murray's room: she assumes that he wants a sexual assault fantasy. She writhes on the floor of his room, begging him not to hurt her. He stands bemused, not touching her. It is the idea of the accommodating Oriental taken to scary lengths.",,Anonymous,Comedy
I guess that Lost in Translation is probably the best movie ever,"This film surprised me, and it obviously surprised quite a number of people. Some liked it, some didn't. I love it. It's this certain tenderness with which every single movement in this movie is choreographed. And at the same time, it's not one of those art-movies which you don't understand unless you have studied Literary Sciences or Arts for at least four years. It's a simple movie about attraction, love (I guess), and life. Bill Murray proves how great he is as an actor. It's odd to see him make fun of himself in a way by playing an actor in his mid-life crisis. Scarlett Johansson is wonderful. Her voice, her smile, and her very special beauty give this film yet another aspect to make it one of the very best (if not the best) movies that I have ever seen. And in addition to that: It contains the most beautiful love scene ever - on the hotel bed just before they fall asleep - his hand.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Apology of aesthetics,"Good acting (although it must be said that Bill Murray excels more in comical scenes than in those that require dramatic intensity), impressive music score and outstanding camera work. As to the story itself namely alienation in general, the difficulty of communicating verbally let alone of conveying emotions, the viewer would probably have experienced intense empathy with the characters had they been more down to earth ordinary people. An actor with a two million dollar contract in his pocket and a young girl who could afford to obtain a degree at Yale just don't seem to be the obvious subjects to dabble in superficial philosophical or psychological reflections. The movie obviously focuses more on aesthetics than on ethics and in my opinion leaves the viewer with a faint feeling of disappointment.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Excellent job!,"I love this movie, it cooperates with my inner feelings just perfectly.What can I say more, there are souls in this world that feel the same way as the characters in this film. I am confident to say that every person in this world is alone and has to deal with his own things. The world is a stage and we are actors or gladiators. You may have family or not but it's up to you if you feel good or not. You can never ask someone else to decide because they just don't know how to respond. Well similar things are happening here in this film - two lost souls find each other and they don't desperately try to resolve their it with sex or drugs but with spending time the right way together trying to find out how to go on. Good rhythm and acting! Bravo!",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Bright Mix Of Story And Film,"Sofia Coppola's efficient yet quirky romance is a very good engagement of two mediums, the short story and cinema. Using the technique of linking her converging story (two abandoned souls meet and form a gentle relationship while adrift in a foreign country) with short yet open-ended scenes, Coppola stays on course and doesn't descend into the dull trap of exposition--she succeeds in capturing the essence of a budding relationship, not the deep, complex flavor of it. Her script finds a popular American action film star (Bill Murray) in Tokyo to do some advertisements for a whiskey company; he meets the stranded young American wife (Scarlett Johansson) of a photographer (Giovanni Ribisi) and together they stumble into a relationship borne partly of their isolation and partly out of growing frustrations with their respective marriages. For all the usual observations and forced absurditities about foreign countries (naturally, the Japanese are seen as odd and other-worldly, pale imitations of Americans), Coppola's script is smart: she has insights that belie her youth and she circles the awkward relationship, allowing it to sneak up on you; by the end, even though it's still awkward, it's become accessible and you can easily infer what she doesn't want to tell you. Coppola gets an excellent performance from Johansson and a superior one from Murray; she seems to have captured him at a vulnerable point in his life--he's so in tune with his character's alienation that it appears to reflect his current point of view and not merely a function of the role. It also helps that he's frequently hilarious: his deadpan confusion gives the film a cinematic boost that makes Coppola's film seem less weighted down by its prose. It's a gently lulling picture, with unhurried rhythms; you never suffer the demand to feel that so many modern romantic films constantly thrust upon you and though there's an ambiguous, huddled ending, Coppola openly invites you to share your interpretation with her.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Lots of merit, but not for everyone","The film looks at alienation from many different perspectives and for that reason alone it is worth the price of a video rental.  A somewhat dark, introspective rental, but it does have its points.Having lived in Japan for six months, I found many of the sight gags particularly funny including references to the Japanese fixations of shoes, gadgets and pachinko. There is no way this film could have been written without first hand living experience in Japan and it does a nice job of condensing some of the unique twists a visitor might find on arrival.  The use of the alien background sets the stage for the inner alienation each person experiences.Bill Murray's character is effective as a tutor to Scarlett Johansson's; his character has become adapted to living a life in isolation in a crowd, while she is confronting the reality that the realtionship she has with her husband is not going to be the ideal that she envisioned.  Bill Murray's off-camera wife distills their relationship into control issues of guilt and minutia, to which he is all but numb.  This is perhaps the best character for Murray since his overlooked role in ""The Razor's Edge.""  It's about time for his characters to mature and I hope his next venture is another drama.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
An below average plot that can bore even those that like slower paced movies.,"Watching this movie was almost torture it moved so slow and I kept hoping it would get better. I don't think since the English Patient have I been more disappointed after some have hyped this movie. I saw this after the Oscars and was hoping it would win since I wanted to see Bill Murray say something funny up there and Sofia just seems like an interesting person. But WOW after finally viewing this I am at a lost of words that some would even call this ""Hilarious"" it was slightly amusing in one or two scenes, but doesn't excuse the weak plot. Bob Harris Bill Murray's character in the movie is so shallow and uninterested in everyone and everything from talking to his family to pretty much all the Japanese people, to even the admiring Americans in the bar. He spends most of the movie making cracks or smirks about everything, he is usually much better at this in other movies however. Then we have Scarlett Johansson's character, Charlotte who is just as bored and lonely as Bob, but is at least a little more likable, she is shot in her underwear throughout the movie, a cheap way to keep people interested in a otherwise borefest of a movie, she stares hopelessly out the window. At one point she is in tears on the phone yet it is never understood why she is so unhappy living what seems to be an extremely privileged life in a new marriage with a husband that is just slightly busy with work. The only thing that they share is being bored,lonely and slightly hot for each other in Japan, ""oh boy what storytelling"". I don't really wanna touch the stereotype issues, but if you love laughing at certain stereotypes of certain races or minorities maybe you will love this film or as long as the jokes not on you. So whether you are a young grasshopper or an old grasshopper be wise and avoid this turd,the most overhyped movie of the last 10 years.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
racist?,"I thought ""Lost in Translation"" was kinda--dare I say it?--racist--not in a malicious way but in an ignorant way.  I get that the film is supposed to be yet another ""fish out of water"" story--two Americans feel isolated, alienated, and lonely in the Land of the Rising Sun, so they turn to one another for comfort.  But here's my problem: Asia is always the setting for this type of film.  Asians are always portrayed in the media as the strange, mysterious, incomprehensible ""Other"" to whom nobody in their right mind (i.e. white Americans) can relate.  Hey, Sofia!  Asians are people too, you know!  i don't know if you know this or not, but the world is getting smaller and smaller every day (gone are the days of Commodore Perry opening medieval Japan to the west for the very first time!), and the smaller the world gets, the more people realize that hey, maybe we're not so different after all!",,Anonymous,Comedy
lost in translation,"Lost in translation was a very touching movie that had some nice heartfelt moments and also some good character build and rich dialogue between them,bill murray showed that he can be great actor and more dramatic and serious role did a wonders to him and it may be his best one in history,or at least it is tied with groundhog day for a title,biggest plus and surprise was scarlett johansson and she showed how even in her very young and early acted days she was talent to be admired and full of potential,also use of location to be put in japan was also great cause we saw a lot of pretty sceneary and their culture,if i would nitpick i would say that runtime is little short and becase of that their relationship is rushed in moments,lost in translation was a very rich emotional film",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Caught me by surprise,"This was one of those ""caught me by surprise"" movies. First of all, I had no intention of ever seeing this movie...EVER. The reviews were mixed, most people I know that saw it said it was ""boring"". In fact, ""boring"" was the most common word used in describing this movie. Whenever I'd flip through the movie channels I'd catch scenes of the movie and, sure enough, they looked boring. Even though I'm a huge Bill Murray fan, I had absolutely no intention of seeing this movie in its entirety.Then I got the flu last week.There I am sitting in bed flipping through channels and absolutely nothing is on...I've already read all the magazines within reach 3 times...then I happen to catch the start of a Cinemax movie. I realize I'm about to watch Lost in Translation and figure, since my Nyquil wasn't working, maybe this would put me to sleep.All I have to say is that I was immediately immersed in the movie and when it was done and over with, it was like my life had changed. I'm not gonna dwell into a huge review of the movie...let's just say I loved in from every angle...acting, directing, cinematography, etc. What I am going to tell you is that when this movie was over, I felt like I was happy, sad, and somber at the same time. The effect has worn off a bit, but for a while I felt like I was walking 6 inches off the ground. I haven't had a movie affect me like this since I was a teenager and watched Summer of 42 and Edward Scissorhands. Back then, I was young, innocent, and naive. Now, I'm 30 years old and MUCH more cynical and less impressionable. And this movie hit me like a ton of bricks. On the flip side, had I seen Lost In Translation as a youngster, I doubt I'd have made it past the opening sequence...or maybe not.Here's why the movie worked for me...in a nutshell: When Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanssan's characters were together in a scene, you never wanted them to separate...when they weren't together, you wished they would bump into each other again. You felt their comfort and their anticipation.You may find this movie boring, absurd, and a complete waste of time. But you could also find yourself unable to move, blink, or even breathe...just WISHING you could jump back into their world again...when they were together.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Not a masterpiece, but very good nevertheless","Good to see that so many people rate this film highly, in spite of the depressingly familiar reaction from others to what is a deliberately slowly paced study of displacement in an alien environment. Are those who found it boring really so used to fast editing and special effects that they cannot just sit still for ninety minutes ? The irony is that the two central characters find themselves at sea in a culture - modern Japan and Tokyo - which epitomises the very empty garishness that is typical of so much modern film.My problem with Sofia Coppola's film is not that it is boring, or racist (though those with a social-political axe to grind may find it so). It is that the nature of the relationship between Charlotte and Bob is formed mainly out of shared awkwardness and alienation rather than affection, and that Bob's character intimates sexual desire rather than emotional affinity. Apart from in the final sequence, which, tellingly, was improvised rather than scripted, the characters are not allowed to just be with each other; rather, we see them dance around each other's need for connection, without actually connecting. For example, when Bob carries Charlotte to her hotel room, he does not need to look disappointed when she goes to sleep, simply accepting of their age difference. It's not that a physical relationship between them would be offensive, it's just not necessary. (In the strip bar scene they leave after only a few minutes.)The contrast between Charlotte and the blonde movie star, and between Bob's one nighter with the hotel singer and the Bob-Charlotte relationship, is well made and sufficient to tell this tale. Sure, Bob's family and domestic trivia await his return, and Charlotte has been left to her own devices; but that's no reason for a full-blown affair, and the understated - until the last scene - affection between them is what carries the film.My other problem with the film is Bill Murray himself. Perhaps it's that I never have liked him much, but I think it's more that he is, simply, being himself - or, rather, Bill Murray playing Bill Murray. So we get his typical facial grimaces and expressions, put to good use in the ironical and comic whisky commercial sequence. We see only the Bill Murray that we know, rather than a Bob that the actor might have been allowed to create.So, a sensitively and beautifully shot portrayal of a putative relationship in a foreign culture. Scarlett Johansson is clearly destined for very great things, still and self-aware beyond her years, and Bill Murray will have done himself no harm by this self-portrayal. Ms Coppola has created a controlled and individual work with talent compounded of experience (instigated by her father ?) and observational skill. A pity that the surface of the film, typified in the title shot of Ms Johansson's prone behind, is at variance with its centre.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Sofia's Laughter,"I still believe that Sofia Coppola did an effective acting job in ""The Godfather  Part 3"". Not that I am crazy about her acting abilities, but although she was resourceful, Sofia was treated so viciously by viewers and by most mainstream critics, that she must be laughing out loud now that she knows better, especially with the reactions to her second movie. People have loved this film, but in my case I think it's a fine movie that's overrated. Sometimes it's just plain blank, with a couple of sequences and many single shots that could have been left out of the final cut. It is a joy to watch Bill Murray in an excellent performance, and seeing Scarlett Johansson grow from the days of ""Eight Legged Freaks"", but after a while the Japanese jokes become tired and the emotions between their characters become redundant. It may be new to those who have never even considered the possibility of establishing a relationship like the one described here, of friendship between a man and a woman and an older man and a young woman-, but not to those who have always respected the opposite sex on the same level and as their complement. It could have been a better film with 20 minutes less.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Everyone wants to be found,"Francis Ford Coppola is one of the most recognized directors in the cinematographic field and it was to be expected that his daughter, Sofía Coppola, would follow the same path, although in her own way and with her own personal stamp, as demonstrated in 'Lost in translation'.
The film has a simple premise, two people lost in his life meet in Japan and a relationship arises between them.
It is admirable how Sofía Coppola instead of trying to imitate her father does the opposite, trying to differentiate herself from him. And it certainly succeeds, having a much more expressionist staging, with great attention to detail and a really beautiful composition of the shots. All these elements, part of a great direction, she uses to give depth to his protagonists, but always in a very organic and subtle way. Since the film more than represents a romantic relationship, it shows two lost souls who meet or see in the other a way to continue living.
Sofía Coppola's proposal hides an unexpected depth within the simplicity of the story and that makes it acquire a beauty beyond the obvious. This gives the film a special connection with the viewer, something that only a great filmmaker can achieve.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Fabulous Movie,"I hope that anyone who has not seen this movie was not been discouraged by the comment above. This person obviously cannot appreciate quality films considering he bashed both 'Lost In Translation' and 'American Beauty' in the same post.Just because a movie is dry and does not have overly dynamic characters that does not make it a bad movie. 'Lost In Translation' has very beautiful and unique cinematography and has a refreshingly realistic plot. Two Americans, who are very different, find a common bond through their awkward feelings in a foreign country. Bill Murray portrays an American actor who is hired by the Suntory company in Japan to advertise liquor. He does not assimilate very well into the Japanese culture and finds himself alone, until he meets Scarlett Johansson. Johansson is a newleywed who is being dragged to Japan by her photographer husband who constantly leaves her on her own. The two meet in the hotel bar and continue to experience the country in many hilarious ways.Even though the movie is mainly set in a hotel that does not stop it from having great scenes. The hotel itself, the Park Hyatt in Shinjuku, Tokyo, is one of the most beautiful hotels in the world.The director's portrayal of the Japanese culture and people stayed very true to what it is actually like. I have visited Japan and my grandparents are Japanese so I can state this and have experience to back it up. Anyone who has visited would be able to sympathize with the character's inability to sleep from jet lag and the character's surprise to how different the culture really is. We may find the situations stereotypical but that does not necessarily mean they are untrue or patronizing to the Japanese people. I believe the director was just trying to make the film as realistic as possible. Which is a respectable action, to me.Not everyone will like this movie because there are many people who cannot even begin to understand what a good movie really is, but if you enjoy dry humor, Japanese culture, and / or Bill Murray this film will definitely end up being one of your favorites.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A lightning in a bottle look at love and Tokyo,"The little film that could, Lost in Translation somehow managed to make a friendship/romance between Bill Murray's downtrodden actor Bob Harris and Scarlett Johansson's meandering Charlotte be both believable and lovable, as the two kindred spirits find solace in one another's company against the backdrop of the sights and sounds of one of the world's most vibrant and unique cities, Tokyo.From humble beginnings as a $4 million dollar film, through to a box office worldwide smash and Oscar winning critical darling, Sofia Coppola's considered and heartfelt love letter to the Japanese city and lost souls that can inhabit it holds up today as deeply personal and affectionate drama that would be hard to repeat and features arguably career-high moments for all involved.Following up her well regarded debut The Virgin Suicides, Coppola instills Translation with a sense of wonder, everyday pondering and minuscule, yet wonderful as we witness the birth of a friendship between Harris and Charlotte that comes about through a mutual feeling in each of their lives that something is not quite as it should be, extenuated by the fact the alive, bustling and colorful city of Tokyo has awakened their feelings of loneliness and unhappiness in a life altering moment of time that will see the two's lives changed for ever.The film is lovingly directed by Coppola, there's not a lot of flash or pizazz here, Translation is very much an intimate film but by placing it within the surrounds of Tokyo, every inch of Translation feels alive and filled with moments of gentleness, wonder or whimsy that is memorably played out by its two leads.It could be justifiably argued that Translation features the last truly great Murray performance, with the esteemed comedic actor fitting perfectly into the shoes of the deadpan Harris while Johansson has gone on to feature in some of the era's biggest films, there's a vulnerability and rawness to Charlotte and her performance that hasn't been mined to the same depths since Coppola did here with the two A-listers enjoying their time playing out a script that won Coppola a well-deserved Oscar.One could watch this Oscar winning film and say that not much happens, there's a lot of time dedicated to both Bob and Charlotte wondering around experiencing the sights and sounds of Tokyo or simply stuck in a dive of a hotel bar with bad cover singers, while the two main characters don't even really interact till around 30 minutes into the film but there's a dreamlike quality to what Coppola has done here, allowing us as an audience to be swept away by the otherworldly like nature of the city in which our on paper mismatched duo find themselves in.Come the films emotionally charged and much talked about and debated final segments, you quickly begin to realise that Translation has the powerful ability to grasp the viewer into a daze like state that's meaning and heart become more apparent as you sit and ponder the one-off magic of Coppola's lightning in a bottle film.Final Say -Lost in Translation isn't a perfect film but it's a heartfelt true to life tale that acts as not only a showcase for its director and two leads, but the magical city of Tokyo that represents another world entirely filled with hope, dreams and the potential to find oneself in amongst the flashing neon lights and bustling streetscapes.4 angry barman out of 5",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Seriously flawed,"I like the understated, quiet feel of the film and the story line, and thought Sophia Coppola did a good job as director. But for me, the film was seriously flawed on 2 counts. One of these is Bill Murray's lacklustre acting. Some people who liked the film saw a middle-aged has-been actor who has nothing to look forward to except waning years of mundane domesticity, but all I saw was someone who fell asleep in his role, a fact that even the technique of the camera zooming in to show disaffectedness couldn't save. To me, his character just did not come through. By contrast, Scarlett Johansson's subtle, textured performance delivered the goods. From her, you do really get the sense of someone who feels lost in her own life, not just in Tokyo. The other problem with the film is the caricaturisation of the Japanese as little people who spoke funny. There's absolutely nothing intelligent about that.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The movie everyone said I just HAD to see ... but I wish I didn't,"This is the movie that everyone told me I MUST see, yet after seeing it I wish I didn't. To understand this, please take into consideration that I am a western person, dating a Japanese person for +5 years and having spent quite some time in Japan.Now, all my western friends urged me to see this movie, telling me it was funny and sad at the same time and gives a perfect depiction of how life in Japan is for western people, the interaction between western people and Japanese and lots of cultural references. So finally my girlfriend and I rented the DVD and sat down to watch it... all I can say is, I wish I could get my 100 Yen back from the rental shop.First problem: I don't know what kind of movie this is and what the message is they are trying to convey: it's not funny, it doesn't contain any deeper message, it's not realistic and it's ultimately boring. I can only hope this was some kind of experiment to make a satire that makes fun of Japanese, and even in that regard it's a bad movie.The way Japanese are portrayed is just plain wrong: professional translators are depicted as nothing more than idiots who feel the need to 'edit' messages. I speak both Japanese and English and know full well that one cannot always just translate literally from Japanese to English, but they exaggerate this to a point that it becomes comedy. Japanese translators should be very offended by this movie.Our main characters are totally egotistical and make no effort whatsoever to adapt and blend into the country/culture they reside at that time. After only watching the movie for 5 minutes my thoughts were: guys, just go home already.The general Japanese society is depicted in such a racist way that I find it offense even though I am not Japanese myself. Having spent many years studying the language and culture of Japan, I cannot help but feel offended that a country with such a rich culture and language is portrayed as if it were an alien planet on the original series of Star Trek, with people that are retarded to the point they just can't work with foreigners. Anyone who has been to Japan and has taken the time to adapt oneself (which one should do or just not go there at all) knows this not to be an accurate representation. Sure, Japan has it's problems, but Lost in Translation exaggerates them to a point it isn't even funny anymore, making it borderline racist! Next time Ms Copolla directs a movie, I hope she will at least be more respectful to the culture her movie plays in and she will at least perform a tiny bit of research before packing and moving over there to tape meaningless scenes totally disconnected from reality.The funny (or sad) thing is that I've been to a lot of the place they've taped and have also stayed at the Park Hyatt hotel once but unlike Mr Murray and Ms Coppola, I didn't fill my days by drinking at the bar and staring aimlessly out the window like I've just been lobotomized. I basically just went there to sleep and take a shower, like normal people do and the rest of the time I was out in the city doing my business. The shooting locations in Kyoto are also places I've been. Ms Coppola somehow manages to be at some of the most attractive tourist scenes by her lonesome self ... perhaps she went there just before there was an announcement that a 9.5 earth quake was going to hit Kyoto and everyone evacuated ... and even then there would be more visitors than in the movie! But of course she needed those quiet scenes to depict the 'zen' part of Japan, as any new-age hippy would do.At some point in time, I was wondering whether I was still watching a movie set in Japan or a fictional story playing in the head of some acid-junkie who just came down from a bad trip.For those wanting to watch movies that REALLY portray Japanese life, I suggest renting or buying Japanese movies like My neighbor Yamada (Yamada-kun no tonari), which albeit being an animation has the advantage of showing a correct image of Japanese society in a funny way (a bit like the Simpsons parody US society while at the same time containing a lot of truth).Seriously, I want my 100 Yen back from Ms Coppola!",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Forever Lost in Translation,"Maybe it's an age thing .... or maybe my age group are unimpressed by Sofia's family's clout, but without exception everyone of my friends who has seen this movie are totally in agreement:  a painful flop.

There is no electricity between the two characters; at no point did I ever get the message that anything was ever going to happen between them, their late night romp through Tokyo was just an attempt at creating something memorable (like the restaurant scene in ""Pulp Fiction"") that is just static and noise.Francis Ford Coppola has such standing in Hollywood that I think no one dares say ""actually, this is a turkey"".

"Stereotypical, but engaging","Despite the stereotypical portrayal of the Japanese, this is an engaging film about love, intimacy and companionship.

One Of The Decades Best.,"Across this feature a beautiful narrative of friendship, loneliness and love unravels across the hectic array of Tokyo, driven by Sofia Coppola's masterful directing and Bill Murray's and Scarlet Johansson's career defining performances.The beauty of this film is so beyond others, the simple colouration done on classic film feels so sincere, and yet, delivers on the loneliness and then later the love, and caring that develops between the two main characters. The clever cinematography delivers the foreign dynamic, the wonder and bemusement of an entire wold lost in translation, yet being in the middle of it. This immersion is on a level that only few films ever could achieve.This films beauty stretches to its heartfelt screenplay, which characterises its figures so successfully, so clearly and delivers upon their lives complexities and worries so masterfully. A wonderful story, though some may say it meanders, I truly understand and grow to care for the characters more deeply, and thus in my opinion it strengthens the feature. The screenplay also delivers upon the initial awkwardness, when shot in tandem with the cinematography, the tone for each scene is display and inferred enough for the audience to immerse in the emotions more deeply than in other films.The acting is truly of the highest league. Bill Murray has even said this was his favourite performance. Together, coupled with the beautiful screenplay, Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray have such a sweet, colourful and loving chemistry that clearly shines through into the final product. Theres so many scenes to display this combination, what comes to my mind most is the scene following the party where Charlotte leans her head on Bob, and the final scene between the two. In addition to this, Giovanni Ribisi is fantastic as always, and the rest of the supporting cast deliver upon their characteristic functions to the plot, in the upmost quality.Unlike many post 2000 films, the music in this film is truly of remembrance, the slow guitar and quiet melodies and motifs that repeat and develop throughout the scenes truly compliment the feature. The music does not dictate the emotion, this is up to the audience, it acts as a vehicle to stratify whatever emotion the viewer feels in the scene. This is a highly uncommon achievement, which is worthy of great praise.This film evokes different thoughts and responses from all people, as it has a mature subject, children would not enjoy it. But I feel very personally about this film and truly it holds a special place in my heart as one of my favourite films. Due to its beauty, decorum and truly pure craft.Despite this, no film is without flaw. On the subject of meandering, some scenes were executed to near perfection, however on some but not all repeat viewings certain scenes lack the same impact, particularly in the first half of the film, though the later scenes grow in their meaning and emotion upon repeat viewings.Overall, I truly love this film and give it a very high 9/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

12:34 AMLost in translation
It's about a middle aged American actor and a college graduate who meet in japan.
I am glad that I watched this movie. Though its looks a bit old as more than 15 years have passed since it's release. But the screenplay is amazing. The story line, music, dialogues everything still holds true at present. The acting looks effortless. It's not the quintessential romance were people meet and fall in love. It's about how they meet when they have their own crisis going on and how an unknown culture and country binds them into a companionship. It offers you everything drama, romance, emotions mixed with a dash of comedy. The story line flows smoothly and transitions so well from them being just
acquaintances to developing a platonic relationship and ultimately a deep sense of affection for one another. There is no mushy love or heartbreaks which one might expect. There is this soothing connect and bond between the leads mixed with a certain amount of lingering sadness. It ended on a pretty satisfying note according to me though I will always wonder about it.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Masterpiece,"All my friends said the movie was slow and very bad. But when i saw it I felt happy in a way I never felt before. Sophia Coppola has made a movie that has a tempo that is floating all the way and the screenplay is the best ever. The only director that is in her category is her father Francis Ford(The Godfather). Bill Murray does an incredible performance and Scarlett Johansson does the best performance by a female actress in history. If you think the movie is slow, think again. Because it is not too slow, it is perfectly slow. Nothing in history can compare to this film that shows that there's still a chance for great movies to come. It is a movie that must be seen. My friends thinks I'm crazy when I say it's one of the best movies I've seen. I'm 18 years old and should like action and comedy. But nothing compares to a drama, specially when it's done by Sophia Coppola",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
True sense of Humanity from young Sophia,"Amazing how Sophia has captured humanity so intensely and so true in Lost in Translation.Despite her relatively limited experience, she has brought to life a wonderful and believable story about two people who slowly overcome the incapacity to believe in love. It is breathtaking how Sophia has managed to keep this story at exactly the right pace. You see the characters slowly but surely opening up and reach out for a short and intense moment of happiness (the final sequence).Filmmaking at its best which reminds me a lot of Antonioni but also some of the more recent Italian directors. And yes, some of the best acting from the last year(s).",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Overrated but OK,"There's no doubt that ""Lost In Translation"" is a ""good"" film. However, i definitely didn't like up to the amazing word of mouth I have heard about it.Simply put, it's just not directed that well at all. For one, there are many parts of the film in which nothing ""happens"" and many empty stretches where what you see is nothing more than space filler. Some may see this as ""artistic"" but there are ways to do this and keep the viewer interested. Sofia Coppola fails to do that here.She also fails to get the most out of the actors. While Bill Murray pretty much saves the picture, Coppola just doesn't get that much out of him or Scarlett Johansson it seems. Scarlet looks absolutely amazing so that helps, and she does well, but it just seems that a better director could have gotten more out of these two. They do fine, but both would have been better under someone else more capable. Murray, who is absolutely fantastic in ""Groundhog Day,"" just looks way to bored in certain scenes. He does drama very well, but he's not *that* good, leading me to believe he was bored as hell making the movie.The plot moves along very slowly and grudgingly, as if the movie really doesn't want to make the effort but because there are people in the theater (I think?), it has to show some sort of progression. It just seems very forced. This is where Murray and Johansson save the film, despite not being used to their fullest extent. They even save some completely useless and silly scenes, like the one in the stripper bar with that ridiculous song playing.The film tried to be a ""thinking"" person's film and would have succeeded have done properly. It still managed to be a good film, but in no way does it come close to some of what I had heard about it previously.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"boring movie, inaccurate view of Tokyo","I think the film makers have spent a few weeks or months in Japan maximum, and did things like go to night clubs, weird parties, and the usual tourist spots. Probably due to this the movie comes off with a view of the country like Americans usually have of other countries-- inferior to their own and things that they encounter and do not understand, instead of trying to comprehend they just brush off as quirky or act like they are putting up with something.  The only American who fit into Tokyo really well was a freaky American actress there giving interviews for a new martial arts flick.And the plot... a wife goes on a business trip with her husband and gets p***ed because he is working all the time? A father's kid runs out of the room and refuses to talk to him when he calls home? What kind of father is he when he is home to have a child who reacts like that?I had no sympathy for these characters whatsoever.I further got annoyed when they reflected their own insecurities onto their host country. Made jokes about Japanese people (both in their presence and not) and sulked around. And the film makers didn't even get the jokes right -- one really not funny one was how the 2 main characters went to a hospital and no one spoke English.  Bill Murray made some crack about how they were not going anywhere else and the female looked blankly at the doctor.  Ha ha. Americans making fun of non-English speakers in non-English speaking countries is not humorous to begin with. Especially in a country where the language is so far different from English and really difficult for native speakers to learn.  Would it be funny if Japanese tourists came here and laughed at Americans because they cannot speak Japanese? And it was actually inaccurate because Japanese medical doctors pride themselves on their English ability-- they are taught quite a bit of English in medical school. And the hospital most likely would make sure to give the non-Japanese speaking American tourist visiting a hotel there a doctor whose English is especially good.And the translator for the advertising company, in the first scene her English was quite good but then she could not translate the simplest things the camera man was saying to her.  The camera man was saying really simple things in Japanese, things like-  you are waiting for an old friend as you drink your Suntory- it does not matter if he turns from the right or the left- this is a top of the line expensive whiskey, treat it that way- (when he said this the translator said something like- do it more slowly).  How could the previously adept English speaking translator not get any of it right.And is doing group exercises really that funny?  Maybe that is one of the reasons Japanese people are not as fat as Americans because they exercise regularly (and eat healthy food, which the Bill Murray character did admit).Japanese people cannot pronounce 'r' and 'l' sound? Don't we all know this? (and don't think it much of a curiosity. very few in the audience laughed at this one) Incidentally, Japanese has a sound that is actually pronounced somewhere between 'r' and 'l' and it is a rare Japanese-speaking American who can get it right.I think the goal of the Kyoto scene was to add a (gratuitous) touch of the exotic. Japan is in the mysterious Orient, after all.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A very demanding movie,"Not only the movie was torturously slow, I was torn by the demands of the movie.I was supposed to care about the two characters. Bob was having a mid-life crisis (what's new?) while Charlotte was trying to figure out what to do with her degree in philosophy (she gained my sympathy right away).Although their spouses were presented deliberately in the background by the director, I couldn't help but had more interest and respect for the spouses. Bob's wife was back home managing a home improvement project and parenting (isn't a happy childhood important to anyone?).  Charlotte's husband was following a concert tour, photographing.I was supposed to understand while Bob and Charlotte were hanging out in Tokyo with the ""so what"" or ""now what"" attitude.  Out of all places, am I supposed to believe Tokyo (or New York City for that matter) is a boring place to hang around for a few days?I was supposed to laugh when the movie was making fun of other people's accent.

Two lonely people connect.,"Lost in Translation is the perfect film for anyone in a lonely period in their life. We have all had someone who for a fleeting period has given us a platonic connection the likes of which we cannot find with anyone else in our lives. The cinematography is beautiful with the cold use of melancholic blues and static, wide camera that creates a feeling of isolation I think many films struggle to capture. Sofia Coppola used real world locations in Kyoto in order to create a raw, documentary style feeling. I genuinely think anyone who wants their feelings put into a setting and two brilliant characters will love this film. Thanks.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Well worth finding,"A warm and quietly compelling portrait of two people trying to navigate their own changing circumstances and the strange new culture –Tokyo, circa 2003 - in which they suddenly find themselves.Bill Murray, as Bob Harris, portrays a world-weary film and TV actor who's on yet another job to pay the bills and who looks as confused by his latest workplace as any new visitor. He gives probably the most convincing portrayal of jet lag I've seen.Scarlett Johansson is so good at portraying characters who are 'outsiders' in some way, and here she is excellent as the bemused, curious and disoriented Charlotte, newly-married to a young photographer and accompanying him on a shoot. Her character especially benefits from Sofia Coppola's proved skill in portraying young women on screen, while her character and Bill Murray's are equally well-observed and well-acted.The film has some nicely-observed comic moments while convincingly conveying the sense of being 'lost' in a foreign culture and trying to find one's bearings there and in the wider world, and even in life itself.And it must be said that Tokyo comes over as a really vivid and 'live' place – it's only strange to the two visitors because it is what it is.All in all, a real gem of a film, excellent.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Film Liquet on Lost in Translation,"An American movie star (Bill Murray) and a young, married college graduate (Scarlett Johansson) are both stuck in Japan, not knowing a word of Japanese, they seem to be lost in translation, as the title suggests; however, it seems that they are out of place with both Japanese people and foreigners. One day, not able to sleep they encounter each other in the hotel and their friendship begins. The film portrays an experience that most people can relate to, the feeling of not belonging and being lost (whether in life or abroad). Edited with a lot of jump cuts and focusing on making the viewing experience seem alienating, Coppola based much of the story on her experiences in Japan.Aesthetically, the film shows many different sides of Japanese culture, showing both the youth filled night streets lit by neon, and the hard working adult environments during the day. The shots are well done, some intentionally done handheld to relate to the characters and some completely still to focus on them or their actions. The film was shot in an improvised, almost documentary style manner and the Director of Photography (Lance Acord) minimised the usage of artificial lights, not using the conventional Hollywood way of shooting, in order to maximise the realistic setting. This way it feels simple and alive, allowing you to see yourself in the characters and feel them.There are no subtitles present, to put the audience in the same conditions as the protagonists of the film, absolutely lost and without an idea of what to do. Nonetheless, the film is an absolute pleasure to watch and it makes you think and question your life and your purpose in it.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Slow and personal journey,I finally watched it after it stayed on my watchlist for too many years. It was a surreal experience as the movie explores two entirely different characters and their emotional development in a busy society.One is enjoying fame while other is turning into a woman and becoming aware of her self. Two characters meet in their own story arch and instantly connect. Emotional connection that is deep and further explores the bond between them. It is some achievement by director Sofia who had to live upto her family name. But one can see her own unique style in this piece of art . Overall it is worth your while.,7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
amazingly bad,"I have seen some truly awful films in my life, but this scrapes the bottom of the barrel.It's as if a bunch of film-school try-hards were sent to Japan, without a script, and told to produce the most pointless cinematic experience possible.  Partway throught the film,  these film-school rejects meet a representative from the Japanese Tourist Board who pays them to insert further meaningless 'postcard' views of Japan.So, what could I learn from this film? - Gee, aren't the Japanese quirky and strange - Gee, isn't it difficult when I am in another country and I can't speak the language - Gee, isn't it strange that I feel alienated when I am in another country and make no effort to genuinely appreciate the culture or people -  Gee, even shallow people can 'connect' when they meet other shallow people and decide to have a good whinge.The most insulting part of this whole mess is that it is currently rated, on this website, as the 175th best movie of all time.I weep for humanity.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Lost in Boredom,"In the beginning, we see Bob's (Bill Murray's) arrival in Japan. Soon after that, he is sitting on a chair, posing for pictures for the commercial he is doing. He is given direction about what to do, but it is all in Japanese. A lot is said, yet the translator says practically nothing. It is frustrating for him, since he knows the person said much more. It is frustrating for us also, since there is no translation for us either; however I assume that is the intent.Note that the reason there is a translation problem is that there was no effort to translate. I get that impression of the movie also; there is relatively small effort (compared to how ""big"" the movie is) to communicate what is happening.There is not much effort to show cultural differences, which is what we would expect, based on the title. The story is about two bored people, as if Japan is boring (is it?). We see images of Japan, but not much about difficulties relating in Japan, other than being bored.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Sofia Coppola has done a good job,"I didn't see Sofia Coppola as an important director. I can't say that I liked her movies I've seen before. But I found this movie quite mature. It is impossible not to be impressed by the beauty and acting of the young Scarlett Johansson. It's not a very deep story, and it's also simple to predict what will happen. But you still want to watch and finish the movie because the tempo is very well adjusted. Bill Murray's performance is great.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Much better the second time........................................................,"I would have to agree with others on this site that ""Lost In Translation"" is often better appreciated on a second viewing. I wasn't much impressed with the movie the first time I saw it. Initially, the""Charlotte"" character seemed to be much too self-interested. She came across (as acted by Scarlett Johansson) as nothing much more than an awkward if precocious child. I also thought that the relationship between Charlotte and the Bill Murray character (Bob Harris) was a little too cute and contrived. The Tokyo presented in the movie seemed a weary and confusing way-station on a journey to nowhere. My attention continually flagged on the first viewing.When I viewed L.I.T.again (six months later) I came away with a much better opinion. The movie is very effective- after all -in telling the story of an unlikely friendship between two people drawn together completely by chance but both engaged in a common struggle to come to terms with their lives. Coppola has to be given credit for the clarity and thoroughness of how the story is told. There are few if any purely incidental scenes that I can find--every step is set out with a purpose (often with a dual purpose). As an example -the scene with Bob Harris and the Japanese ""premium fantasy girl"" is,at first glance, done just for laughs --and it is funny. However, coming as early in the movie as it does, it was designed to show that the Bill Murray character is not a pig (not all of the time at least). When offered a prostitute --he sends her back. This idea is reinforced later as Bob and Charlotte form a bond which doesn't quite reach the level of sex. The movie does have a clear ""women's sensibility"" in that respect.The idea of intimacy without sex intruding is not something that many male directors have explored. It isn't till late in the film that we see that Murray's character is indeed interested in sex.... He does sleep with the hotel lounge singer for the express purpose of showing the audience that he does have the impulse.The relationship between Bob and Charlotte is cloudy in some respects. It remains platonic however there are hints of the ""sex thing"" lurking out there. Curiously enough Coppola goes to the trouble of offering some ""cover"" for Bob and Charlotte to have sex by letting us glimpse their marital frustrations. This is especially true in the case of Charlotte as we are shown her husband's mild infatuation with a Hollywood bimbo. In the case of Bob we are allowed to glimpse the cold nature of his marriage by comments his wife makes (or doesn't make) as they talk over the phone. But --in the end--this ""cover"" is only used to justify the intimacy of Bob and Charlotte's friendship.The Tokyo of the movie, for me anyway, comes to represent life. Life is sometimes like being a foreigner in Tokyo --with all its excitement(and dreary boredom), confusion--the feeling of being lost and adrift - and the seeking.One aspect of the movie that I have not seen discussed in the IMDb reviews is the effect of Bob's celebrity on Charlotte. He is described as being ""washed up"" -however everything is relative. He is still making $2 million dollars for a couple of Tokyo photo shoots --he is still an easily recognizable celebrity. One wonders if Charlotte would have approached and sought a relationship with Bob if he was just a 53 year old businessman visiting Tokyo. In ""real life"" Bob's celebrity would have been the crux of the relationship--but In the movie it seems almost incidental to the story. It is interesting to speculate as to what the movie would have been like if they had chosen to dispense with Bob's celebrity status.I usually don't like ""women's movies""--romances etc.......I think everyone can agree that the saving grace of the film is that the two main characters don't sleep together---It gives the movie a sweet tilt....... O.K.-I must be getting soft or having a mid-life crisis. It does however give me a warm and fuzzy feeling to think that there must be some girl out there--fresh out of college -who might adore me for all of my sensitivity and vulnerability--..well...I hope my wife doesn't read this review.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Charming with Great Chemistry,"I thought this movie was solid and achieved exactly what it was trying to portray. I resonate with feeling ""lost"" at the moment so to see it portrayed so well between two characters who are at least two generations apart but come together with the same pain of hitting a rut in life. The chemistry between Murray and Johansson was so well done for a couple of actors with a large age gap. I didn't rate it higher because it just wasn't my style of film and seemed pretty aimless most of the runtime but I also see the charm in how it's shot. The ending is brutal and I think the chaotic style of random scenes bringing together two unrelated characters on a weekend of finding themselves worked so well. 3.5/5 stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
the most romantic story ever translated.,"When this film came out at the cinema, I was torn between going to see it and waiting at home, thinking about whether romance was still alive. In hindsight, I now see that I made the wrong decision in not going to see it, as seeing it would have let me know that love can still blossom.Charlotte is a young newlywed, staying in Japan with her photographer husband. Neglectful of her and swanning off around the busy Tokyo streets, Charlotte meets Bob, an old, washed-up actor advertising Santori whisky. in Tokyo by himself, he joins Charlotte on her tours of the city, in sitting in the hotel bar when suffering from insomnia and in sharing marriage troubles that he has with his wife at home in the states. Will they kiss or won't they? You ask yourself this the entire way through the film.Many people see this film as boring and pointless, but it really is a story about love and the fact that it is still alive. I think this is one of the most romantically silly films ever made, and the chemistry between Johansson and Murray is amazing.The Tokyo mise en scene is breathtaking, and the attention to detail from Coppola is close to perfect. Every shot seems to be carefully planned out, from the metropolitan yet tranquil view out of hotel windows, to the busy arcade scene.This is truly a feel-good film which rekindles your interest in silliness and the things done for love.

Finding our selves,"Lost in translation is a film about two American people, who meet each other in a foreign country  Japan. They become friends and help each other to make their stay as comfortable as possible. The main hero is Bob (Bill Murray), a middle-aged American actor, who arrives to Japan to do a promotion of a Japanese whisky. The person he meets is a young woman Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), who comes to Japan with her husband, who has some work there. All the other roles are unimportant; the whole story is between Bob and Charlotte. They live in the same hotel, they are completely lost in the foreign country  they don't know the language, they cannot understand the culture and the people. They are alone. Bob's wife is at home solving silly problems via phone with him and the husband of Charlotte is at work all the day and he goes away for few days later.Bob and Charlotte meet in the hotel bar, where they try to forget all their problems; they are bored and have nobody to talk with. They have the same problems at the moment and so they understand each other well and become friends. Charlotte has some Japanese contacts and so they visit a few parties, talking alone in the hotel room after that. Bob is becoming a young guy in the moments with Charlotte, she is starting to think more seriously with Bob, they influence each other. They start to think about their life and about their future in the foreign atmosphere. They spend a few interesting unforgettable days, but they stay only friends nothing more.I think Lost in translation is a very good film. It is very slow, there is no action, but it is no mistake. There are many very good dialogues, a few jokes with Japanese people trying to speak English and mainly it is a film from a real life  something, that could really happen.

Great.,"Although this is not the greatest 'movie' I have ever seen, and by no means should it win the 'Best Picture' award, I found it to be quite the piece of art.Lost in Translation had no beginning, middle or end; in my mind, there was no conflict, nor was there a climax. This move merely ambulated along, not making any specific impact story-wise, but being more of a film for analysis than 'enjoyment'.It seems to me that this was a real-life style story- the dialogue was choppy and at times seemingly uncomfortable... but excuse me if I am wrong, isn't that what most conversation in life is like? There is little obviously contrived, Hollywood-ized content and, to be honest, I found the acting to be delightful; Bill Murray was wonderfully understated (it reminded me at times of Billy Bob Thornton's performance in The Man Who Wasn't There) and Scarlett Johanssen was equally as formidable in her part.All in all, i never sat in the theatre feeling bored, but more content- i feel that I experienced something different and, to be honest, quite wonderful. You don't need profundity to have an impact, nor do you need structure or message to make a good film.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Really nice,"I thought that this film had a really nice subtlety and feel about it. Just the right amount of humor as well. You could see the way Murray was feeling at the start; sort of bored and finding it hard to be enthusiastic. I know the feeling and to see it on-screen felt good.Johansen is, well, Johansen after all- the best looking girl in the world. Pretty hard not to like her. Acting like that at age 19? Absolutely amazing.It really is beyond me how someone could hate this movie, and I love reading some of the 1 star reviews on here (You've got to look for the one that starts with ""Me and my husband have high degrees and watch 50+ independent movies a year."" I also loved some of the scenes where they were meeting people and being random, it had portrayed that perfectly, and I really felt it. And the ending was so emotional and great.

A narrative without an expiration date.,"Many years ago, during my youth, I held no particular affinity for films of this genre. It would be more accurate to express that I couldn't fathom their underlying significance. However, as the sands of time have shifted, and I find myself navigating through the currents of a distinct life situation, these movies have gained a profound resonance. ""Lost in Translation"" now stands as not only one of my personal favorites but also among the finest cinematic experiences I've encountered.This cinematic masterpiece, replete with emotion, vivid depictions of life, poignant moments of solitude, the omnipresence of fears, and an array of life's inevitable truths, unfolds through the lens of two characters. The story is told through two characters-one young and lively, the other older with loads of life experiences, both lost in the moment.The narrative weaves a beautiful tapestry, akin to the story of our lives-interwoven with the multifaceted aspects of human existence. It delves into the intricacies of what we encounter in our life journey, encapsulating a timeless reflection on the human condition.""Lost in Translation"" isn't just a film; it's a narrative without an expiration date, a timeless exploration of the human experience, capturing the essence of being lost in the intricate dance of life.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Lost in Translation,"I watched it, it's the best movie of this month,
because I'm 20 years old and I'm trying to do what I want, I always ran away,
I couldn't find what I was looking for. I called, it's been 20 years,
I'm in a void right now, what can I do,
this movie gave good information, do what you want in life, do what you think, keep it in mind.But we are judged according to our actions,
there should be no moments in life that we feel ashamed of.Anyway, let's get to the movie, the character Bob is bored with his wife. And he came to another country for money and got bored here too.Charlotte's character is similarly bored, so the two get along well.Sometimes a woman comes into our lives, you know her for a week, but it feels like you've known her for years.I've always wanted to experience this feeling but it's so rare Ehhh.Is it nice to watch movies?

"Ok, but Lost Translation is a suffering film that is very overrated","Lost in Translation was a decent film with a little of any comedy. I have always wondered to my self why this is so overrated. That gets to my mind a lot. I don't why it is overrated. What's so special about it, just because they have Bill Murray or the location in Tokyo where they were at. People are forgetting what is special in comedies. Well that was my negative response. My positive ones were that, yes I did like the screenplay of how it was written and the type of culture that was focused in Tokyo. The opening scene of the film was good if you know what I mean and I thought the japenese people were funny. This was an ok film but i thought it could've been better with Bill Murray in it especially.5.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
This is perhaps the best film of 2003.,"This is perhaps the best film of 2003. Even as an 'indie' film, or as a 'popular' film, you can't deny the unbelievably good job Sofia Coppola did in this film. Not only did she give Bill Murray his best starring role since Groundhog Day, she also made note to include the remarkably understated Giovanni Ribisi and 'newcomer' Scarlett Johansson [you can also spot her in Ghost World, among some other films before this one. She is drop-dead gorgeous because she pulls off that natural look so perfectly.] Anyways, if there is any reason you haven't seen this film, go buy it. The cinematography could rival that of Lord of the Rings, except it's modern day Japan. The scenes with the monks and the marriage ceremony will leave you in awe, if you understand the profundity of it.In a time where movies are lacking any real plot [Chronicles of Riddick? Walking Tall? The final Matrix film?], it's nice to see a classic angle get reworked so wonderfully. The interactions between Murray and Johansson are fantastic, and truly prove why they are the best in the biz. Go see this film, now!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Based on all the hype--this wasn't that great,"This is a movie about a dull self-centered person on a boring trip who is ""not yet a girl, not yet a woman.""  (I believe Britney Spears already did a song about a girl in a similar predicament.  Mercifully, that song was only a few minutes long while this movie is significantly longer.)  Charlotte, our protagonist, has no talents of which she is aware (""I can't write, I can't take pictures"").  To further accentuate her uselessness and lack of skills, she tells us she majored in philosophy.  She tags along with her husband on a trip to Japan and while he actually WORKS and socializes, she sits sullenly in her hotel room staring out of window.  Ho-hum.  She does this a lot so get used to it.  My major impulse through most of the movie was to slap the girl and tell her to ""GET A DAMN LIFE.""  Oh, the troubles of being attractive, young, intelligent, with a cute husband who makes a lot of money and meets rock stars and movie stars.  Oh, how horrible that existence must be.  I do not blame the failings of this movie on Scarlett Johansson, a young woman who displays flashes of talent.  She plays the part as gamely as she can.  To make a whiny, boring person tolerable for over an hour is an accomplishment.  The faults in this movie I pin squarely on the creator, Ms. Coppolla--a pampered, sheltered child of Hollywood.Overall, it's not a horrible film.  I just didn't think it was as good as the reviews led me to believe.  On the plus side, Bill Murray gave a fantastic, disaffected performance of an actor just past his prime who is all too aware of it.  The Japanese supporting cast is used stereotypically to some comic effect.  Anna Faris is definitely a young comic actress to watch.  Whether she meant it or not, her dead-on impersonation of Cameron Diaz made the movie jump alive.To sum it up, this film will remind you of every boring vacation you've had in which you met one person who made it a more bearable experience but who in the grand scheme of things, didn't mean much other than a small memory.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"""Roser""!","That's ""roser"" as in ""loser"" with a Japanese accent -- according to the movie, the Japanese switch their r's and l's.

Bittersweet and innocent - romantic without all the romance,"I think this screenplay is beautifully written, with wonderful characterization. So many movies now are actually only a series of events with people acting them out; this movie is very different. Coppola takes plenty of time to develop her characters. Bill Murray is excellent as a witty, charming, middle-aged actor, and Johansson is equally wonderful as a pensive and sensitive young woman who is trying to find herself. They find in one another a sweet friendship, a deep connection, and answers to questions they did not realize they were asking themselves, it seems. It is easy to relate to the characters; they are going through many of the things that we as the audience also experience in our lives. This is a story about...life.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

THought it was good,"Johanssen is good and beautiful as the lonely, young wife questioning her marriage. Her beauty is classic, not necessarily sexual, though she is obviously alluring in this role. Her bee-stung lips, perfect body and haunting eyes may have something to do with that. Still she's more sophisticated beauty than mindless hottie, even at 19. This is a role tailor-made for her. It could never have been Reese Witherspoon or Jessica Alba or - God forbid- Jessica Simpson, or anybody else in that realm.Murray is simply at his best. He does ""exasperated, middle-aged and depressed"" better than most, with his receding hairline and frumpy body. You really believe that these two could connect in a physical and emotional way, as remote as that may seem on the surface. What other 50-something could ever be believed to be appealing to a young woman as pretty as Charlotte? That's a tough chemistry to fake and I can't think of a more perfect pair. What drives them to this attraction is what's intriguing to watch.Go see this. Turn off your ""Major Blockbuster-Tom Cruise-Action-Pop Culture Catch Phrase-Big Star"" mind and tune in with a more searching self. Watch this with your soul and heart, not your eyes.

Found in Translation ...,"First off let me say that this is the first time writing a review of a film since Vanilla sky.I will not write a review unless it impacted me in some way.This movie indeed did.Although my thoughts of this film are not entirely positive ,I will say I came away from it thinking a lot and having many different emotions floating through my head and heart while watching.That being said I thought it was a great film.I relate to this film entirely,within the last 2 years I have been in many hotel rooms and have received treatment beyond my wildest dreams but have come away feeling as empty as a person can actually be. Why is that ? Because at the time being at these places I have been in a very vulnerable time in my life.Lonely above all and without the person i really care about.I'm a male but relate more to Scarlett's character.The time she spends sitting on the window sill of her hotel room ledge glaring down to the beautiful city made me shake being I related to it so much.The Phone call near the beginning of the film to her friend and the tears she let's out were so real.Overall she is feeling completely lonely and needs something or someone to make her feel alive.How many times have you smiled at someone and made a nice gesture towards them but have never truly gotten to know that person.This film breaks that barrier.Bill and Scarlett share a warm moment in the elevator where they trade smiles, while Scarlett departs with no intention of ever advancing that smile into a conversation or a Hello to really find out about each other.Only until later at the bar we find out that these two people truly need each other emotionally and not sexually to become actual people again.Bill and Scarlett still care for their spouses, it is evident throughout the movie.We see Scarlett flipping through photos of the seemingly good times her and her husband have shared , while on another occasion towards the beginning we see her snuggle up to her husband on the bed only to hear him snore rather loudly without any regard of his wife being there.While with Bill we hear his wife scolding him or being very direct almost in a parent sort of way with each conversation they have over the phone with Bill trying almost reaching to make something real of the conversation , but in reality Bill normally agrees in angst and heartbreakingly hears his wife hang up the phone before him each time with no warm goodbye at all.Now we don't know what kind of husband Bill Murrays character really is at home , maybe his wife is cold for a reason.But on the other hand we do see Scarlett's interactions with her hubby with her seemingly stretching for affection with no luck.I can only guess it is the same way at home for Bill Murray's character.People are unfaithful for a reason, it just doesn't happen spur of the moment.These two characters give their hearts to someone else to make them feel alive again and you can never ever bash somebody for wanting to feel like a person again.I felt the laughing and joking between Bill and Scarlett was very uncomfortable at times,But this is only a minor setback to a great movie.What really made this movie come together was the scene at the very end where the two characters engage in a heartbreaking hug along with a whisper from Bill to Scarlett which for a reason is very hard to make out.I feel it is up to us , the viewers, to imagine a perfect goodbye message from our own experiences in life.To end off i would like to say Great acting by both Bill and Scarlett.They truly captured the feeling of two people lost and refound but knowing they will be lost again but now with great memories of the time they spent together. That's all you can ask for in life when you are not with the person you shared something special with.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Lost The Plot,"This film reminds me of the rubbish I used to write as a teenager. Interesting to nobody but myself. The fact that millions of dollars have been lavished on it simply gives it credibility it does not have. I like the central premise of a one off meeting between two people that stays with them for the rest of their lives. But when that happens in life it's usually down to a spark... something happening. Here nothing happens and Sofia Coppola isn't brave enough to contain the film to the time frame of one night. I even suspect this was a play that Sofia turned into a film.The poignant moments aren't very poignant. The comedy isn't very funny. To spend time with either of the two lead characters would bore us into submission. And this despite the fact that it has Bill Murray. And you get the feeling that a much funnier, or more poignant film is happening elsewhere between the photographer, Starlet and lounge singer.Go watch Rushmore ... for Bill Murray's best performance. Go watch Lawn Dogs for an Indie film that knows how to strut it's stuff when it comes to odd couples. Or indeed Ghost World that also shows the relationship between an older man and younger woman. [And also has Scarlet Johansson, pouting in a very similar way.] And go watch Virgin Suicides for a better example of film making by Sofia.It would be wrong to say that this movie is awful, but it comes pretty close.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Brilliant!,"This movie worked on so many levels. It correctly identify the ""craziness"" that Japanese culture has to a Westerner. This is why the lead actor/actress looks uncomfortable when out in Tokyo. I lived in Japan for 2 years and it brought back so many memories and I laughed out loud at many things it covered. Also, the setting helped isolate the leads to make them seem more alone, despite being in a major city. The clever use of silence in the scenes also helped enforce this perception. The storyline was as poignant as I've seen for a long time and it is one of the few movies to come out for a while without gratuitous sex or violence. I found it very endearing and the best movie I've seen released since ""Life is Beautiful.""",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Good, but slightly disappointing","It was hyped up to be the critic-favorite of the year, the little film that went on to capture the elusive taste of the Academy. The rave reviews and the prestigious honors piqued my anticipation, but at the end it all resulted in a slightly disappointing viewing experience. I still enjoyed the film, but it just failed to impress.After a few initial jokes, the movie, having worn the façade of a romantic comedy, turned itself into a serious drama that ponders on much bigger issues in life.The pace of this film was extremely slow, but purposely so with the intention of conducting a character study of two strangers who befriend one another in Tokyo. Thus, the story only turns more interesting when the two main characters, who are almost devoured by their own boredom, finally come into interaction. Stuck in respective plateaus in their lives, Bob and Charlotte long for a counterpart that understands their feelings.While immersed in a world with completely different cultures and language, they look onto the other for a trace of solace and most importantly understanding to their miseries, their isolation, loneliness and dissatisfaction in life. In this aspect, the film delivers, but to a much more successful extent through Murray and Johansson's facial expressions and subtle gestures than Sophia's much extolled writing (dialogue), presenting us with a poignant and realistic relationship of two people, lost in life yet not completely hopeless.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Not typical love story,"This movie gained a lot of positive reviews and awards. And I think it deserved all of it.

No.. there you aren't going to hear ""I love you"" or ""I couldn't live without you"" and so on... No! There you will see two people, who found each other little bit too late, too late, that the love would be unfolded... However, they are not sad about it, they don't feel some sort of pain or grief.

The Best Part is Missing,"This could have been a very funny movie, a la Alberto Sordi's ""Un americano a Roma"" or his ""Un italiano in America"", with all the silly hilarity inherent in an ethnocentric character finding himself in a foreign land. But no, Sofia Coppola wanted to go for the kind of sappy relationship movie that gets Oscar consideration--she succeeded, of course, but at the cost of shedding a good deal of the movie's comedic potential.  For those of you who see this movie on DVD, not to be missed among the bonus extras is the spectacularly funny, full-length version of ""Bob Harris'"" appearance on ""Matthew's Best Hit TV"" (Matthew is absurdly touted in the movie as the ""Johnny Carson of Japan"",setting up the comedic scene).  This scene had us rolling in the aisles(feigning, as we were, that we were watching it in a theater), and it is illustrative of what the movie could have been: a blast of a screwball comedy.  And the fact that the very funniest scene was cut to the bone only shows how misguided Ms. Coppola was in her conception of this movie--trying to take it in a ""serious"" direction when neither the script nor Bill Murray's acting could possibly sustain that orientation.  Again, well worth the cost of the DVD rental just to catch the full version of the interview on ""Matthew's Best Hit TV.""",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A bit underrated movie..,Here is a masterpiece of romantic dramas. The climax reminds me of Roman Holiday and rarely do we find such movies. Differs significantly from the usual romantic movies which have a predictable ending. I wonder why this movie did not win an Oscar. Scarlett Johansson showed some serious talent for powerful roles and was just brilliant in some scenes. Just the first scene was quite strange. I wonder what the director was thinking.

Respectability is alive and well ...,"Set largely in the Park Hyatt Hotel in Tokyo, with some interesting panoramas of that great city, Lost In Translation presents as a very real life-like set of circumstances a lot of us could easily find ourselves encountering.  The film follows a week in the lives of two quite different people - Bob Harris, a middle-aged actor, in town on business, having left his wife and family at home, and Charlotte, an attractive girl young enough to be his daughter.  She is visiting Tokyo with her husband, but he is totally preoccupied with his work as a photographer, and we see as little of him in this film as she does. Bob and Charlotte are drawn together, as they both feel marooned and very alone in the big foreign city, and simply find solace in each other's company.  Despite the obvious generation gap, they become more attracted to each other.  But he is not about to throw away his 25 years of marriage, nor she her much shorter but equally devoted commitment to her young partner. The temptations are there, make no mistake, and on occasions their silent thoughts appear almost as clear to us as if they were subtitled on the screen. I found it uncannily easy to identify with the older of the lead players, as the situation, dialogues and behaviours were so believable - not exaggerated or over-the-top, as in so many similar films.  Part of that identifying was a hope that, if in his position, I would have the strength to react the same as Bob did, right up to the very satisfactory ending which we were all quietly wishing for.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Charlotte by her side is a newly married with a guy (photographer) that is always going out taking photos to places; Bob in the other side is married have children and it's passing by a crisis of the middle age.What I like this movie is how the characters get meet and going out just like a mature way, knowing maybe each other, that the difference of age, mature, marriage, etc. makes that relationship ""just like friends"", and that get evidentiated in a beautiful scene when Bob and Charlotte get in the bed the two of them with clothes, and Charlotte put the tips of her feet touching the leg of Bob, and him touches gently her feet.But the loneliness of both makes them get closer, not physically but yes emotionally as the movies goes on. At the end of the movie (a really good moment of the movie), both say bye (or maybe a until soon...) and a song plays while Bob gets to the taxi that takes him to the airport.Finally this movie has a magic, touching and content that few movies have.

Word of Mouth Review: Lost in Translation,"Review Score: 9/10 – Beautiful Cinematics and an alien culture create some of the best atmospheres for a uniquer love story than most movies.Lost In Translation is the story about aging actor Bob Harris (Bill Murray) as he goes to Japan to film some whiskey commercials. Along the way he meets and shares a deep relationship with Charlotte (Scarlet Johansen) in a down to earth and adult relationship.Where Translation manages to wow and impress is largely in its visuals. There are several expanses of the movie that simply observe the city of Tokyo and other areas of Japan. It examines its plant life, parks, industry, religions, cultures, all without a single word of explanation. This works as it allows the viewer to take it in and form their own opinions about these things. They aren't just placed out of context however, they are always following a character or both the main characters and have reasons for being there.This also plays largely into the comedy of Translation, as Bill Murray winds his way through various media sets from photography to film to TV and even his encounters with a Japanese prostitute and hotel staff are rife with cultural humorous and add to the entire shroud of being misplaced.Being misplaced is a huge central theme of the movie. It accomplishes this by having its American characters in a Japanese setting and going through the most zany and out of whack parts of that culture. The characters both feel misplaced in their relationships and their futures (Bob Harris' failures as an actor and Charlotte's useless seeming position in her marriage and job (she has a degree in Philosophy)). But I do wonder if this effect can truly be felt by everyone especially a person from Japan perhaps, might understand the physical comedy of things like a shower that's too short for Bill Murray, but what about the cultural displacement? So as such, this is the films only true downfall is that it does rely on cultures to shift the difference and apply the alienation to its characters. While this could probably be easily observed by anyone, I do wonder if it can be felt by audiences that aren't innately so Americanized. Of course, that being said, its like having a Japanese person watch an episode of Jersey Shore, and even most Americans know whats wrong with that public face, right? A bit off track there, oh well.Anyways, Lost in Translation is heavy with cinematic sections, a good unique love story, and a very rich and powerful setting that impresses even as it enchants. It is a great movie, and no one should miss it.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Art,"Lost in Translation could easily be compared to a painting. The cinematography is the background with two beautiful centerpieces (Murray and Johansson). The canvas is the bustling Tokyo nightlife. Like any work of fine art, this film is very delicate and full of emotion. The breathtaking location shots are the perfect compliment to the stars performances. Murray is absolutely brilliant in his adaptation of the Sofia Coppola character, Bob Harris. I believe he was snubbed at the 2003 Academy Awards. Coppola has successfully stepped out from the shadow of her father in an incredible way. Lost in Translation is a mixture of great performances, outstanding cinematography and substance; all of which are brought to life by the appropriate soundtrack. The best film of 2003 can only be described as one thing, and that is a work of art.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Bathed In Hype -- I wanted to like this movie more than I did!,"Don't get me wrong -- this is not a bad movie; it deserves a thumbs-up.  I really wanted to fully embrace this movie.  To me. it's a drama - not a comedy - with some humorous, whimsical moments.  That's fine.  My favorite movies are human drama ( I just wrote an evaluation of Secrets and Lies - which I loved - that epitomized human drama.)  Now, I didn't expect LIT to stack up against Secrets, but it fell way short.The good news:  very good performances by Bill Murray (one of, if not his best, role) and Scarlett Johanssen (sp?) -- (this actress has an old soul, wise way beyond her years -- the sky appears to be her limit).  I admire the relationship/friendship between the characters; there is humor (well, a little), good-nature and warmth between them, and I admire the restraint shown in how their relationship played out, or didn't.  I also like how the world-weary actor (Murray) kind of discovers that he actually has some wisdom and perspective to impart to the newly married, disillusioned Johanssen.The bad news:  The back stories seemed to be all cliche, not very compelling stuff w/ no great insights or even great humor.  Admittedly, his wife and her husband are minor characters, but there is just no depth to their stories, conflicts, conversations, decisions -- nothing new or even irreverently different.  And then, the on-the-surface 'Lost In Translation' stuff - showing cultural, language differences between US and Japan -- was just a run over weak, hackneyed turf.  Now, I did not want to watch this w/ a jaded perspective, but how often can you trot out the ""l/r"" thing?  The humor and cultural insight just never ran much deeper than that.So, while I cared somewhat about the two leads, there was just no great compelling story line other than what I felt was Bob Harris (Murray) discovering some goodness and self-respect within his own jaded soul.Re:  Murray's Oscar nomination:  from what I saw it was deserved  (in fact, the part seemed to be perfect for him, a la Groundhog Day.  I thought Groundhog Day, although maybe more 'Hollywood', was more compelling, more humorous and at least as profound as this!).  Yet, I shed no tears for his losing out to Sean Penn, who gave a more rangy, more interesting performance in a much better film, Mystic River.  I do also think that Johanssen's acting (more support than lead, I thought) was nomination caliber, and I hope she will continue to command some great roles moving forward.I rated it 7/10 on this site; it's probably a 7.5, but no more.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Lost In Translation,"A pure film.Throughout the film there is a sense of realism, every aspect is just on point, the cultural and language barriers and the different cultures. The actors don't seem like they're in our world, they seem immersed and connected with that world, that reality. The two main characters have this connection and seem really pure on camera which really makes this movie stand out. Another element is the vivid and fluid scenery which creates a dynamic atmosphere which carries this movie to what it's known for today. In my eyes the movie is about losing connections with others when you lose the sense of being there, communication doesn't work well through a phone and fax machine. It's also about how completely two different people can still create a unique bond and find something interesting and common within each other. Overall a great idea, film and story.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
An effortless movie and an effortless joy to watch.,"Murray and Johansson give two of the most natural performances you will see. Murray who's character could conceivably be autobiographical (and perhaps is why he's so convincing) plays an 80's movie star who's career is on the wane doing some lucrative commercial work. Johansson plays a character who's been married for two years and accompanies her photographer husband on a work trip to Japan.
Both characters are struggling for sleep removed from their time zone. They're struggling with an unfamiliar city and with regret and loneliness. They find solace and kinship and relief in each other.
They are seen sometimes together sometimes apart negotiating life and fun in Tokyo. These moments feel intimate. You as the viewer feel you are there in the moment, just as lost and fascinated as our lead characters.
The pacing is almost soothing, in a bustling environment. The soundtrack is as brilliant and quirky as the city. Tokyo is just as big a star and influence on our enjoyment of this movie.
Though more classically a drama it is at times very funny indeed, albeit with a couple of obvious, if understandable pronunciation gags.
It's warm and layered and mature. It's engaging, it's not forced, it's tonally ""just so"" and I'm struggling to find anything I don't like about it. Maybe that it's too dreamy, velvety and subtle to properly knock your socks off, but that is the sleepy deprived, twilight world the characters are experiencing.....so that's probably worth a mark up rather than down?

Lost in translation,"The first time i saw LIT i thought it was the most boring movie as i ever saw. That was when i was like 16 and two years later i watched it again and i had a totally different thought.The movie is boring but it is a true reflection of life. Drama is life with the dull bits cut out, but this movie portrays life as it is with every scene is realistic and i can almost imagine myself in exactly the same situation as the characters.The movie is about two lonely characters lost in life where they have lost interest in their lives and now they are lost in a foreign city together. Japan where the film is set in a country where the modern and tradition meet. the movie shows scenes set in both the traditional temple and in the busy streets with neon lights flashing. The characters have lost in this separation, they are on the brink of everything, and are indecisive of where they want to go. Bob at the start don't know what he wants and relies on his wife (e.g. with the carpet choosing) and directors to tell him what to do. Whereas Charlotte doesn't have any guidance and no company despite she is in Japan with her husband.The two end up running through the streets of Japan and they seem to find their places and what they want in life. The audience see how they have changed day by day and take actions to take control of their lives again.The cinematography reflects truly of the plain angles that people take to view life as it is. For example there is a scene where Bob has spotted Charlotte being lonely with her husband and friends. The angle is far away but at the same time it also focuses on Charlotte and one can notice her loneliness. This is what Bob has noticed and become interested in her.Overall, the film is a great piece...however it can be a little shorter because from time to time the audience would get a bit bored in some of the scenes.

"Beautiful cinematography, not  the greatest plot.","Well, the movie was shot very beautifully.I do wish ,however, that at the end of the film, the Japanese culture could have been explored through the eyes of less shallow, changed American people.Why should I feel sorry for a girl who is bored with her life and who is a snob? And why should I feel sympathetic towards a man who is making 2 million dollars and is whining about it? Right there, one can easily see how unhealthy the modern American society is! At the end of the film, I do not see them changing their internal worlds. He is not any happier or nicer, she is still a confused person. The truth is these people were not working on making their family lives happier and I doubt that Bill Murray's character would go home and try to be a better husband or a happier father.What was so bad about Giovanni Ribisi's character or his friends' that Scarlett's character had to laugh at them openly? I, as a viewer was not given a reason to think that she was any better than them. I understood the whole searching for spiritual life on Scarlett's side, but for somebody who was Yale educated, it was foolish for her to think so low of people. The problem with a storyline is that it had two lives that intersected for no purpose but for some unrealistic hanging out! The story line started well, but the characters could have taught each other something useful.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Sofia's Coppola personal mark,"The entire movie is marked by some feeling that goes around Sofia Coppola. Scarlet's acting is a proof of that.The movie is pretty nice. Aspires to be some underground critic movie.

An Artists Illustration of Film's Greatness,"A spectacle which embodies the beauty and art of writing in the cinema industry - Sofia Coppola creates a masterpiece in Lost in Translation.An American actor Bob, lands in Tokyo for an ad film and ends up meeting Charlotte, who's left behind by her photographer husband. Gradually, the two discover a friend within each other.Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson are the central figures of the picture (Bob and Charlotte), and possess the organic aura of a telepathic nature that allows the film to flow and add to its rigid structure. The movie is one that is slow-moving, and where there are few scenes of thrill and fire, but instead a collection of well-polished pieces that come together to jigsaw a sensational plot. Coppola also casts Murray in her more recent production On the Rocks also starring Rashida Jones - a film which boasts a similar tone and rhythm to Lost in Translation, reinforcing Murray's prowess of the type of role.Winner recipient of the 'Best Writing' Academy Award, Sofia Coppola - daughter of film icon Francis Ford Coppola - demonstrates that the writing/directing quality very much is a gene that runs in the family. A carefully crafted script that allows its audience to immerse themselves in the words spoken on-screen. Almost written for Johansson and Murray, the film seemingly changes the face of the romance genre, with a complicated connection displayed under difficult circumstances.Ultimately a detriment to love and culture, Lost in Translation utilises setting as a spotter which guides the film throughout its course. The bright lights of Tokyo inputting a sense of vibrancy as well as providing an extra shine to the expertly performed acting portrayals.A film that reflects very little, but holds a great lot.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One of the best films to come out of modern cinema,"This film shows that you don't need a constant stream of events to keep a film interesting. What I mean by this is that there isn't a great amount of story however you are drawn in by the characters and there constant mix of feelings from alienation, to loneliness and eventually to love and happiness.The film also uses great and yet subtle cinematography where its not until you look deep at each shot you can see how much thought has been put into it.And as you would expect from the two leads there is a great performance put in and you see a real connection of friendship.

"Beautiful slice of life movie, not a comedy.","From reading hundreds of comments on this movie and having watched it near a dozen times, I sincerely hope they remove the comedy tag from this movie. It's a very simple slice of life movie about 2 strangers in a strange land who fell in love with each other.  It has some comedic elements but to those who think it must be another Groundhog's Day, well, it's not.  It's a beautiful drama piece with a lighthearted story and wonderful shots of Tokyo.  It's about information and culture shock, where the 2 main characters tried but failed to interact with, simply because they knew they were not there for long, and instead, they interacted with each other. Living in the same hotel, they had only each other.  It might be a lolita relationship, it might be that they're aloof, but they are definitely not as cold as some heartless souls made them seem from some comments.It's also not a political statement about how short Japanese are, no matter what some on the board try to say.  Those scenes are only about how different he is with his surroundings, as are many other scenes in the movie.  If only people can take it more lightly, it wouldn't be as ""overrated"" and ""racist"" as it's proclaimed.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Downbeat character piece that meanders,"Just saw LIT the other night and was blown away. The visuals were stunning. Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray were excellent. Unfortunately, too often in this movie the ""plot"" meanders and the characters too often become part of the scenery in the many beautiful set pieces. It's a bad sign when in watching the deleted scenes (I saw this on DVD) you can think of entire sections of the movie that could have easily joined them on the cutting room floor.The comedy is that of the downbeat and jaded. Ignore any critic who uses the word hilarious in his or her review.Bill Murray plays a washed-up actor in Japan to film a whiskey commercial. Scarlett Johansson is a twenty-something wife of a hot shot photographer who leaves her to work in and around Tokyo. Murray and Johansson meet and begin a whirlwind relationship, exploring a Tokyo that is a profusion of light and sound.Unfortunately, Murray and Johansson have no chemistry and there is little sexual tension between them. Watching them together is like watching an awkward middle-aged man hiring an escort for the first time. Their relationship hints at nothing deeper. The only eroticism in this movie is generated when the camera, apparently run by someone with a fetish, focuses on Scarlett's legs as she, in panties, lounges, lonely and sad, for long stretches in her apartment.The movie wisely avoids the typical older man have a mid life crisis meets younger woman trappings, but fails to offer anything engaging in its place.Coppola apparently shot with an 80 page script and improvised many of the scenes. It shows. There is a slow, pointless section that takes place at a hospital and a wild montage of a night out that, while fun and gorgeously constructed, is entirely expendable. The movie relentlessly sets up the Tokyo landscape, exploring its nuances. Unfortunately, it does this at the expense of a subplot involving a third character that would have enlivened the airless relationship between the two main characters.The movies makes you feel the characters' boredom and aimlessness, but never transcends it to make you care about them. Indeed, this movie has zero narrative drive. That Coppola won an Oscar for the script is laughable.The best movies strike a balance between character development and plot. LIT is top heavy with the former. I couldn't help thinking this would have been a better short film, but with no market for those, this had to be expanded into a feature film.7 out of 10 stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Fairly real and the direction is superb, but is there really a point?","I'll make no bones about Sofia as a director. She sets a mood and is very skilled.My gripe with the movie lies in the story. If I were to give this movie a grade based solely on that, I would give it a 6. It's very realistic and has some parts that made me crack a smile. I even laughed a couple of times. It's pure and believable, for the most part. Some argument has been raised on here as to whether or not it isn't, and although you could argue both ways, I think it was truthful for the most part, and not too fantastical.Even if it isn't or is, however, what's the point? The storyline is a guy in a normal marriage looking for spice and a girl in a marriage that she is questioning start spending time together. There is an attraction beyond friendship, but both somewhat realize that there's point to delve into it. A bit of emotion, a bit of fun, and we have a weak story that really doesn't say much. It's just indulgent directing carried along by a bland but well-told story. I would have cast Murray too, as his quirky humor did lift this movie on occasion.As for all the people who think that the humor borders on racial stereotyping, if you were in Japan, and you finally found someone you could identify with after many days of quasi-alienation, I think you'd quickly try and find a way to identify as well as you could with the only person who is willing and able to give you attention. The barrier of language is tough, and that point is made well by the movie.However, this movie suffered from the beginning. There really is no story. It's subtle, but more because it's not really inspired; there is no contention.I got a very Salinger-esquire feel from it, in a way. It's just a story that tries to make something out of nothing. It's not particularly aware, it's not particularly funny, it's not particularly enlightening, and yet there is a tiny piece of all of that in it.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Absolute Rubbish,"This must rate as about the most disappointing film in recent memory. Absolute nonsense. I strongly advise anyone who is seriously considering wasting their money on this sorry excuse for a film to save their money and spend it on genuine quality such as Mystic River or 21 Grams. The very fact that this film exists demonstrates that nepotism is alive and well in Hollywood, does anybody seriously think that directionless nonsense like this would have been made had it not been a Copolla at the healm?? I think not.Now onto the film itself. At the end of the day this is simply a concept film where the concept is seriously deficient. OK, I get the message - all out relationships, with one another, with our family, our work colleagues, our neighbours are, to a lesser or greater degree, 'lost in translation'. By transposing the film to Japan where the language barrier further accentuates that concept we are forced to consider the other barriers that exist between us beyond that of language, i.e. emotional barriers.And I get the fact that the lack of dialogue is supposedly used to further demonstrate that language is never the key barrier between individuals, that people don't connect through words but through their attitudes, ideas, emotions, beliefs etc. The problem with this film is that Copolla doesn't know how to express this concept in any meaningful way. The lack of dialogue does work on occasion but it needs to be supported by powerful emotive performances on the part of the leads (Bill Murray deserving of an Oscar?? - you have to be joking!) and at least a hint of dialogue, however subtle, to pull the strands together (how on earth Copolla won Best Original Screenplay for a film without dialogue is beyond me). The only dialogue that exists is trite and shallow. Maybe that was the intention, that the characters can't express themselves in words, but I just found myself crying out for the characters to reveal a little more of themselves and their situations.Ultimately, the film comes across as a series of set-pieces that just feel like fillers. Bill Murray striding mournfully across a golf course does indeed express his disconnection from his own and others lives but then so does him lying on his bed night after night after night unable to sleep, and so does him sitting at the bar alone, and so do numerous other 1 minute scenes. The same applies to Scarlett Johansson. We don't need it hammered home quite so tediously and repeatedly that the prime characters are feeling lost and removed from time, people and place - we get it in the first 15 minutes. Copolla should move on and build the film around that fact but instead wallows in this single concept, very boring and very disappointing. I think you'd call it flogging a dead horse.It also struck me as a film bordering on the racist. I read a few reviews that suggested that this was a comedy - well the only alledged comedy I saw was all at the expense of the Japanese and the supposedly hilarious fact that they don't speak English. After about the 10th shot of Bill Murray looking bemused at a Japanese speaker I felt angry more than amused, I thought we'd left that ignorant brand of comedy back in the dark ages of cinema where it belongs.Ultimately, I left the cinema feeling that in the hands of a more accomplished writer/director this film *may* have worked but as it stands it couldn't be any wider of the mark.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Race with Boredom,"This was an incredible race to see whether the two boring lead characters were going to be as bored as the audience, some of whom walked out. Unfortunately the person with me was of the type who hopes against reason that something will eventually come along to redeem the film and make it worthwhile.  This virtually NEVER happens.  I confess I am not a fan of Bill Murray.  His atrocious acting in the awful remake of ""The Razor's Edge"" (*) was almost matched here, but he convinced me he was bored with his work as an actor (getting $2 million for the whiskey commercial he was to do in this movie might make some at least try to conceal their boredom), bored with his wife left behind in the USA, and bored with life altogether.  Such people get no sympathy from me.  With the vast richness life has to offer, anyone who cannot find some area of interest to get excited about or at least seriously interested in is pathetic.  The female lead, ignored by her husband, is equally bored.  They make a fine pair.  At least they develop a little interest in each other, but I could not care less about either character or where this was going.The film gets a 10 for photography.  Delete the story and the actors and it would have been a beautiful travelogue of Tokyo.I have appreciated ""arty"" films in the past but this one left me totally unimpressed.

Sofia Coppola's First,"I remember seeing Ms. Coppola in Godfather 3, opening night. I was living in NY City (Soho) in a tiny flat; 4th floor walkup. I thought she was poorly cast (not her fault; her father's). Regardless, she has a terrific eye, which is a valuable tool, for her job. This film, which I did not see until years it's release, totally blew me away with it's overall vision. When you consider this was made on the tiniest of a budget, with a very small cast and crew; plus it is all shot on location in Tokyo (and surrounding areas), and stars Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray: This is quite a feat. Of course, the actors, which also include Giovanni Ribisi, who is very good at playing a workaholic photographer married to Ms. Johansson's character (woefully oblivious to the needs of his brilliant and beautiful wife). I know Ms. Coppola is helped by people who know her father. By this, I mean it must help her in the choices made for her crew and casting. That noted, I don't care who her father is or isn't; she is extremely talented as a director, which is proven by this film especially (her first, no less), and her subsequent work. Looking at the money only, I noticed the budget was only $4 million, but the worldwide gross is well over $100 million. That is a tremendous success financially. This is great, but from my standpoint as a seriou film fan, (and I'm sure hers, as well), she has made a remarkably good film that anyone would be proud of-I surely am. Having met Bill Murray, (a co. I owned in NY City worked for him in 1990), I can tell you he is a truly authentic actor: What you see on the screen is pretty much what you see if you talk with him for a couple of hours. He is a hilarious and charming person; no pretension at all. I know how good Bill Murray is. Scarlett Johansson truly stunned me, considering she was only 17 years old when this film was made, and, first realeased. It is a special, one of a kind film; a must see.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Life, Actually","This is an excellent movie about how real people act everyday. Whether or not this is an actual autobiography of it's writer/director Sophia Coppola, it is something everyone can relate to. Set in Tokyo, it's the story of Charolett, a young woman who is newly married and on her honeymoon. Alone for most of each day in a big hotel, she finds herself constantly running into Bob. He is the other side of her story. He leads a completely different life than her but they bond over the fact that, though they are different, they both feel lonely in the same way.The acting is the spectacular part of this film. Actually, it's Scarlett Johansson who deserves most of the credit. Bill Murray is his same character, and though he plays it very well, he has in truth, a lot longer to work out the kinks. Johansson plays Charolett with a subtle manner that more than holds its own against Murray.The screenplay is good. Not great, but good. In my honest opinion, the Coppola is what won this movie its one and only Academy Award (Original Screenplay). It's neither clever nor is it funny in an outright manner. But this movie is a dipiction of life and life is not usually any of the above. Still, the poetic dialogue only survives because of the skills of those delivering it. This should be seen because it's very real and is easy to relate to. ***/****",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Bill Murray was amazing...very funny scenes happened when they were shooting his commercial. The bar scenes dragged but the music was good. The landscape and photography is amazing... yet not appealing in the communication areas....I guess we are all lost in translation. When these two characters connect.....the chemistry works well.

That's why it says in the trailer Friendship NEEDS NO TRANSLATION. You can just have a friendship. Period.That's what also makes it deep: Friendship. It's not about LUST or LOVE. It's the fact that a friendship can work even without having anything in common or anything like that.The great thing also is the fact that though they had nothing in common, or things you most commonly associate with having to be friends, they had a special bond. That's why the ending can make you cry.Scene-wise, the best and greatest parts are the one of silence and when the characters are just staring out. That shows the film's beauty.Excellent performances by the whole cast and PERFECT soundtrack by Phoenix and Kevin Shields.Kudos to Coppola for making the front-runner of best film of the decade.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
a simple look at a movie about life.,"looking over some of these comments, i can tell lots of people love this movie, and lots hate this movie. to tell you the truth, if you (like me) are totally in love with all things Japanese, you'll love this movie simply for giving a slightly different view on Tokyo than you might have seen before. The basis of the movie is a friendship between two mismatched people stuck in a city which they find confusing and a little scary. if you have ever been to Tokyo (or Japan for that matter), it is surprising how anyone can be bored, but it does happen. This is an emotional and funny story about two people becoming friends and discovering more about themselves and life from each other, whilst trying to comprehend a city which to them makes no sense. it might not be very actioney and some people will probably find this boring but it's a nice look into the minds of people forced to look at themselves in a different light, and i'm sure we've all felt like we don't belong at least once.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Need of Translation,"People today have become more and more stupid, easy things need to be translated into even more easier things. This film draws from peoples willing of not knowing, so everything is translated into something they can understand.We get pretty pictures, but nothing special, we get visual actors to translate the words of the screenplay to pictures. We have a unexperienced director with a great idea but too complex for her to understand so she loses some of the genius in the translation there as-well.The use of pictures is clever, but not necessarily remarkable, since you don't really need to translate pictures, you only need to translate the token confined in the picture, such as culture, but token-to-token translation is easy.In my mind this would have worked better with a more experienced director. The other thing that didn't work for me was Bill Murray. I think that Kurt Russell was better suited for this part. Largely due to the fact that this isn't what we would expect from his, just picture him doing the kareoke scene.The point of the film was lost in translation. Since it is based on the target audience not understanding Japanese or Japanese culture. This alienation of people is dangerous.We also have different media in the film, as video games, commercials, kareoke, and the play with-in the play is a bleak shadow of that played in In the Mood for Love.This is a film in a row of wannabe-deep-films, Ghost World is one example, but since the directors aren't experienced enough it's pointless.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
the Bitter sweet taste of encountering..,"Such a great film.. ""just like honey"" - like the song from Jesus & Mary Chain of the soundtrack.. What is beautiful is that Coppola surpasses the obstacle: usually it is very hard to depict the connection that can occur when you meet certain people - the interaction between people is something vague and fragile but very substantial at the same time. Sofia Coppola manages to show the bitter sweet taste of sharing things that need not be told in words between two total strangers. I loved it. And the reason is that it combined the pulse of American filmaking with the aura and beauty of European cinema. Tokyo is the best background, Both Bill Murrey and Scarlet Johansson are great, and DO NOT forget to buy the soundtrack.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
casually racist,"Lost In Translation is a very well-crafted film. Lance Acord's cinematography is nothing short of masterful. The acting from the leads is nuanced, characters memorable.The film's casual racism, however, is deeply regrettable. Almost every scene revels in the throwaway mockery of the Japanese: accents, language, culture, stature: all are subject to a torrent of snide belittling by the film- makers. What's more shocking is that more attention hasn't been called to this. Put another way: if this film was set in Africa and contained similarly juvenile mockery of the populace, there'd doubtless be uproar.All in all, a well-made film severely let down by an unforgivable streak of crass racism.",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A movie based on absolutely nothing new.,"After watching and deliberating over this movie, I was left completely empty. Based on the reviews I have read, which claim this is Bill Murray's acting triumph, I was expecting a plot that had creative dialog. What I received was an empty movie filled with the same thoughts and inner turmoil we all struggle with on a day to day basis. The only aspect of this movie that offered anything refreshing was the couple never consummated their relationship. This movie was 9 1/2 weeks without the sex.All people feel insecure at times. All people wonder if the decisions they have made are the right ones. Who doesn't believe that what they want will be fresher and more exciting than what they have? This movie is based on typical experiences that everyone feels throughout their life. It's not worth the celluloid used in it's production.Bill Murray's acting triumph? maybe, if you compare this role to Caddyshack and Groundhog day.This movie is dry, boring and uneventful. I was waiting for an ending which would give me some degree of satisfaction. A kiss on the cheek, a smile, and the taxi drives off. Hasn't that been done a million times before?1 Star.

Classic Bill Murray,"As a life-long Bill Murray fan, I was drawn to this title. A quirky film, but very watchable. Not too deep, but it is engaging. I would recommend to any Bill Murray fans. Scarlett Johansson is very believable as the ignored wife of her photographer husband on assignment in Japan. We get to see many of the sights and sounds of Japan as the two main characters travel around the country. I was hoping Bill's character would stay true to his marriage as would Ms. Johansson's, but you will have to watch to find out. The hotel and customs of the Japanese to the visitors is quite different than those we have become accustomed to her in the US.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Before Sunrise II,"I don't know how many of you who remember the Reality Bites ""Sequel"" - Before Sunrise, starring Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke. However, i found that particular movie captivating - two twenty somethings meet on a train in Europe and get to be together for just one vibrating soul searching inlovegetting night in Vienna. I felt that it captured a certain ""feel of the time"" for myself and my generation.

And now for something completely different,"It is quite ammusing to read the comments written by people about this movie, and also a nice surprise to see that with all of the hate for it, it still manages to get into the top 200. In my opinion this film was great, because unlike with all the other romantic comedies (in my opinion it is not really a romantic comedy, but i can see how it can be seen as one), this one knows what it is doing. It's not a movie that can be enjoyed by everyone, or always. Its quality seriously changes depending on the mood you are in, and most of the times, when you cannot in anyway relate to the emotion, the film is booring and slow. But if the film has meaning its great. It seems that for a film such as this one people expected to get more immature humour, as is typically associated with romantic comedies. You can't expect two people who are having problems with their marriages to go around joking the whole time. Its not racist in any way (matrixfighter's comments), it only attempts shows Tokyo the way it actually is (Japan's younger generation is eccentric) and you are contradicting yourself when you say johanson's character is ignorant if all she does is cultural tourism. The acting is great, and all the humour that is there is adult because you have to be able to understand the situation and I highly doubt that anyone under 18 could like this movie at all.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Review,"An American actor and a beautiful woman meet in Tokyo and they are getting familiar with each other. Both of them do not get used to the stay in Tokyo and they are worried about each future. This film describes the difficulty of human relationship and of understanding cultural difference. The story tells us the importance of telling our own honest feeling to people, especially friends and families, for if we do not tell the honest feeling each other, we cannot communicate and understand each other. What is more, I am interested in the description of Japan and Japanese. I feel that the descriptions of Japanese are excessive from the viewpoint of Japanese, such as an interpreter and a director. But the whole Japanese society are described well, so they may be helpful for foreigners to understand the society of Japan. I recommend everyone to watch this film because I think everyone has experienced such feeling once.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Very good but slightly flawed,"I enjoyed this film but thought that the director didn't handle the many solo actor (filling in the background about strangers in a strange land) scenes very well.

Lost in Muzak,"The Emperor and his tailors must have been working overtime, such were the levels of hype accompanying this meandering, mediocre offering in which Murray's jaded Hollywood actor bonds with Johannson's restless philosophy grad in Tokyo. If Murray coasts along in a lazy by-the-numbers performance, Johannson rarely convinces us of her character's 'hidden depths': perched on hotel window ledges in her knickers, like a bored Vogue model between photo shoots, her appearance suggests not so much 'yearning' as deeply cynical direction; had this been made by someone other than Francis Coppola's daughter, without Murray or a glamorous female lead, you wouldn't have known it existed. (It wouldn't, in fact, have existed.) While the depiction of Tokyo is so glibly stereotyped it effortlessly manages to insult both native and tourist. The critical plaudits this received would seem to have much more to do with the nostalgic good-will levelled at any release starring Murray, and a wistful hankering for Johannson among male, middle-aged film critics. Little more than Love Actually for the 'Art'-conscious middlebrow market.",,Anonymous,Comedy
"An Funny, Ultimately Elegiac Masterpiece","I don't remember the last time I felt so fiercely, emotionally protective of a movie. It's too bad that we live in a time when subtlety is sometimes mistaken for boredom, but this film is anything but. It's exquisitely rendered with a knowing eye by the gifted daughter of a gifted man, who knows how to paint with quiet, hushed emotional colors. It's a bittersweet examination of two lives going in opposite directions: Bill Murray is a once popular, now fading movie star whose life, both professionally and maritally, is in stasis, while Scarlett Johannson is trying to figure out what it's all about. These two people cross paths and give each other hope and love in a crazily foreign land, and in unpredictable ways that are by turns witty, ironic, tender, and finally heartrending. Never has Bill Murray's gift for finding the pathos underlying his brilliantly hip comic sheen been so generously and perceptively uncovered. Bob Harris is a guy I can fully understand and relate to, leading his life of quiet desperation and weary resignation. The luminous Scarlett Johannson is an old soul in the body of a rapturous 19 year old who perhaps reminds Bob of what he once thought he was or could be. Charlotte brings back Bob to life for the brief time they are together in Tokyo and it's one of the sweetest, smartest, and wisest screen pairings the movies have given us in ages. What Charlotte receives from Bob is the truth about life and marriage: it doesn't get any better, just more complicated. Now that's love. Sofia Coppola and her unforgettable cast have made a film that will stay with you for a long long time.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
delightful. boring yet exciting. i loved it.,"i love this movie essentially because it's so close to home. I think I can relate to it.Lost in Translation is about 2 people, Charlotte and Bob, who are staying in the same hotel in Tokyo. Bob is a former action movie star who is filming a commercial for whiskey in Tokyo. Charlotte is a newlywed who's workaholic photographer husband is away for a few days.Bob and Charlotte see each other in bars and elevators, but don't talk until Charlotte confronts him in a bar one night. The two go on escapades and parties together. They go to dinner, they become very close friends.Bob has to leave Tokyo. Charlotte stays for a few more days. BOOM. Bob is out of her life. He says goodbye to her in the hotel but on the way to the airport he spots her in a crowd. He runs to her and gives her a hug. THE END.Sofia Coppola's masterpiece mainly informs us that some things, though they are not always with us, last with us forever.Great acting on Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansen's parts.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Its one of those films that you don't want other people to see because it feels like it belongs to you, like a piece of music you have just heard for the first time.

Everybody wants to be found.,"Last night I watched Lost in Translation for the first time. It was very late and I couldn't sleep, so I went past all the movies that were on the shelf and noticed Lost in Translation, which I wanted to watch for a long time - and I don't know if this is something that I share with other people - but I never really was in the mood for it, last night I was and so I did.The funny thing is this is the first movie that inspired me to review a movie, and give advice to other people to watch it. The movie's been around for ten years now, but hey who knows, if someone hasn't watched it yet, I strongly recommend you should, because you are - like me a day ago - missing out.This is a great film which resonated with me, and I'll explain why without giving away the plot. It wasn't until a couple hours after I watched it that I came to the conclusion that it's a romantic comedy. The reason for this delayed conclusion is that it's not in the way you would expect a romantic comedy to be. All the elements are there though: you have the guy, you have the girl and you have the glances. But something happens within the film that contributes such an amazing almost depressing atmosphere that words like genre almost fade away.Using Tokyo as the backdrop for the story was a great choice, for me it felt like it was a character in itself, and added this feeling that at any moment the main characters would wake up and just resume their normal lives. Also have to mention the side characters in the world, they really embody the strange bizarre parts of the world and help make my theory of the fugue state in which the characters live in all the more convincing.I think another element that was brilliant is putting in feelings that basically everyone has felt at one point. Especially the feeling of being lost or helpless on this particular level is very strong and very well depicted in the movie. So my hat's off to Ms. Coppola.Finally, stellar performances of Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson really transcend the film into being able to shift from on the surface to very deep, or from funny to serious without noticing when the changes appear. I personally feel very lucky to have watched this film and would wish that with the multiple viewings that are going to happen in the future, to have that same mixed feeling of happiness and melancholy every time the film ends.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Acting is great, but the story is lacking",I thought the two leads were incredible.  Bill Murray deserves the accolades and I hope he starts getting more work again.  Scarlett plays the ingenue to perfection.  She is definitely on the rise; the camera loves her and she has the acting chops to continue. The story to me was lacking.  I liked what Coppola was trying to accomplish but I felt substance missing two thirds through.  It seemed she did not know what decision to make with the characters. I will say the photography was outstanding as well. I just don't think the movie is a great as some are praising it to be.,6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Unforgettable,"This is one of the most beautiful love stories I've ever seen in a movie. It's almost magic: shy stares, a sweet caress, long silences that tell us everything...

"Walk, Don't Run To See This","""Lost In Translation"" got a lot of good critical buzz (including last week's LA Weekly cover), so I rushed out to see it.  It wasn't that good.  It had its moments, but it wasn't very memorable.  I'm not sure why critics were falling all over each other to praise it.  Bill Murray is funny in a very subdued way, and Scarlett Johansson is pretty and charming throughout. Nevertheless, ""Groundhog Day"" still remains Murray's best performance, and ""Ghost World"" is still Johansson's.Sofia Coppola directs the film quite skillfully, but the problem is her script.  The relationship between Murray and Johansson just isn't that interesting, and rather contrived.  The ""cultural differences"" they run into don't resonate very much, if anything, Tokyo comes across as much too capitalistic and westernized.  I didn't find anything particularly memorable about this film, but it is entertaining and fun to watch.  For fluffy entertainment value, I give it 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
It should have been lost!,"A film that never gets going. I felt that I wanted to get up and push the main characters to go faster. Neither of the leads gave their characters any substance. The story line is un-interesting and the acting so animated that paint dried quicker. I have never seen a film where nearly ten minutes was wasted listening to an inane, mobile phone call made from the bath - what was the point? It was obvious before that, that he and his wife were on different planets. A pity the film wasn't. In one one word this film was insipid. The following week I went to see Jack Nicholson's ""Something's Gotta Give"". Lost in Translation should take note. Jack was 1000 times funnier, the film had more substance and the characters were totally believable. Lost in Translation is an ideal film for those pseudo-intellectual yuppies who couldn't tell a good film if they were told it was. If you are a normal thinking person, avoid this film like the plague.",,Anonymous,Comedy
"A bittersweet, independent and excellent film, combined with an excellent title, performances and direction.","I recently saw this film and I have only positive things to say. The title ""Lost in Translation"" is very fitting, no matter how you look at it. I felt that there was a parallel between the communication of the two protagonists, as well as their lives in Japan.Two Americans go to Japan, whose culture is completely different from their country and they feel out of place, they get culture shock. They cannot be adjusted easily. Mainly the female protagonist, as she's more sensitive. At the same time, the two have a big age difference and again there is this gap in communication. They get ""lost in translation"" both in their mindsets as Americans in Japan, and with each other.One is middle-aged and going through an age crisis and the other is a woman who lives in a country she can't adapt to and is neglected by her husband, who works all the time. They find ""comfort"" in each other's face. He, seemingly depressed, seems to live through her again. Through her youth. She, among strangers, finds an ""ally"", a ""companion"", a person who understands her and possibly teaches her some things from his point of view, being more mature.A typical example is that after Bob lives for a short time carefree with Charlotte, he begins to feel that not everything is over and that he has the right to live carefree, without thinking and overthinking situations. So when he talks to his wife on the phone and tells her what he did in those days, she, in addition to a cold attitude, also shows an icy indifference, something that makes him come back to ""reality"".He, mostly rational, depressed, thinker and lonely. She, mainly emotional, needs to find herself. Even if they had no age difference, they would still be ""lost in translation"". However, oxymoronic it may sound, one complements the other. One finds meaning in the other.Another typical example that shows both their age difference and the maturity of their thinking is when Charlotte seems to be jealous of Bob and being ironic to him, and he gives her the answer ""Wasn't there anyone else there to lavish you with attention?"" This scene shows that they have a different way of perceiving situations. Their relationship is not based on the sexual part. Their relationship is primarily spiritual. Romantic too. But it is presented in a very innocent way.Some things I liked about the movie are as follows.1) The first and last scene. The first scene, because it is a physical representation of a painting by John Kacere. It was a very original move by Sofia Coppola. The last scene, because it makes us wonder what Bob might have whispered to Charlotte. Instead, Bob makes a cliché, more impulsive and not for his age move, which is beyond even him, showing us that in order to go through with this move, he has quality and pure feelings for Charlotte.2) Louise the owl. Need I say more?3) The atmosphere of the film is not like typical mainstream American films. It's more artistic, with an aura of an independent film. I would venture to say that it is closer to European cinema than to American cinema. This particular film is a purely artistic intervention with romantic elements in a purely minimalist context.It is a film that, if nothing else, makes you think. It does not present anything obscene and the result is perfect.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Lost In Translation: 9/10,"Sofia Cappola is one of Hollywood's directors that can make silent pauses and no dialogue in between movies so irresistibly watchable. Her takes in writing and directing movies within movies isn't new, but there's something new in this, maybe it is in a foreign setting. Movie star Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is going through a mid-life crisis. He went to Tokyo, Japan to promote a liquor drink that was going nowhere. Staying at a hotel and drinking at the bar downstairs everyday, he started seeing a newlywed who's also having a complication in her relationship, Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson). Perhaps the movie's main element isn't the top-notch award-winning script that shaped the movie in every way, or the stylish directing from Sofia Cappola, perhaps it's the unbelievable chemistry between Johansson and Murray (nominated for an Oscar).

"Disliked the characters, but liked that fact I did.","I recently saw this film. I had wanted to see it for awhile, particularly because I had lived in Japan.

As an American who blends well into Japan, I have grown to dislike Americans who behave in the manner that the main characters did. I'm glad it didn't have a Hollywood ending, and I'm glad it wasn't a sleazy romance. The characters were both flawed, fairly mean and annoying--but that was a good thing about the movie.I also feel that the movie relies too much on setting, without the ""weird"" world of Japan the story would be pretty boring (unless moved to another exotic locale.)

Awful movie!,"This movie, for the most part, Sophia's fault. Then again, this film is the work of a wealthy, very very lucky woman who only had a chance in the film industry through blatant nepotism. The ending product is exactly what people must expect from someone like her.Tokyo Japan is an illustrious, breathtaking world class city with its very own character. Anyone in this would want to try out different cultures can enjoy the city without having to team up with someone of their kind. Only completely miserable bigots that need therapy will not enjoy the city as tourists. It is more than an aesthetically pleasing tourist trap, as the film implies. If Bob and Charlotte were believable, enlightened creatures, they wouldn't need each other to appreciate the city and life itself. In the ending it absolutely astounds me as to why a Yale grad with a philosophy degree can't even figure out what to do with her life (law school?), and why the old timer couldn't just retire if what he did made him miserable.I only pitied Charlotte's husband, who actually had a direction in life and true passion, yet got married too soon; and Japanese people from around the world for being mocked in a film that gained subsequent accolades.The movie's concept is a great idea, but when you stick the main characters in a real city and treat it like Alientown, it doesn't work, and even seems borderline racist.

The glances and deliberate acting all works.

If you like the idea of suspending animation for 90 minutes to find out who these two are, you'll probably fall in love with this movie. It helps if the title alone imbues you with a sense of loss and brings a bit of a tear to your eye.9/10 for me. As I say, not for everyone -- but better than 9 out of 10 people find it well worth watching. For some reason, with this movie those who saw it and didn't like it are particularly talkative.Edward",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Sweet and offbeat,"This movie reminded me a lot of 60s foreign films.  I had not realized how far away we had gotten from movies like A MAN AND A WOMAN and JULIET OF THE SPIRITS.  Despite the big budget, LOST IN TRANSLATION is an intimate story that is told from a very distinct point of view.  It's slow moving, but nonetheless has an eccentric charm that keeps you watching.  Not a lot really happens on the surface.  It's very much to the stars' and Coppola's credit that what's going on inside the characters is very clear, yet never directly stated.  Ms. Coppola has a subtle eye and ear that have allowed her to skewer a lot of contemporary types along the way.  I wouldn't call this a really hilarious comedy, but it is, nonetheless, a sly and amusing almost-love story set against an alien backdrop.  I liked Murray's good-natured performance, but I think it is young Ms. Johanssen who emerges as a genuine star in this film, the first true star to come along since Julia Roberts.  She has both natural beauty and an intelligent quality.  She reminded me a little of both the young Ingrid Bergman and the young Isabel Adjani.  I believe she has a major career ahead of her, which is why this film will always be around.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Great Performances in a Moody Comedy-Drama,"LOST IN TRANSLATION (3+ outta 5 stars)Well-handled comedy-drama about two lonely, confused (and married) people who develop a bond during a stay in a Tokyo hotel.   Bill Murray plays a famous actor in Tokyo to film a series of bizarre commercials... Scarlett Johansson plays a young wife accompanying her husband, who is on a job and too busy to spend much time with her.  Unable to sleep and with too much free time on their hands, they turn to each other for comfort and companionship.  Bill and Scarlett both give great performances... naturalistic and effortless.  There really isn't much of a plot... beyond the obvious question of ""How far is this relationship going to go?""  Sofia Coppola (daughter of Francis Ford) wrote and directed and, on the basis of this, there are probably some really good films in her future.  Bill was definitely robbed at the Academy Awards this year... no way should Sean Penn's method over-acting have been chosen over this.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Totally affected, I couldn't even finish it","It's a rare day that I can't finish a movie, because I like to see even the bad ones through to the end. But what is this nonsense? The movie wreaks of affected directing. The whole adage of ""show don't tell"" is flipped on its head here, because the writer/director is ""showing"" so much she is in fact telling. It is constructed in a very cynical way that breaks the illusion of the characters and the world that should be created around them. So many moments wreak of the director trying to say something implicitly, thus you are thinking more about the direction than the characters. I can just imagine some of the explanations. ""Look as she sits on the window sill, looking out towards the town all alone... it marks her isolation from those around her."" And in this smug directing, the characters are forgotten. They don't even interact for the first 30 minutes of the film, and it's just clips of anything almost randomly. Ooh look, there's a character receiving mail, there's a character walking through a lobby, oh look there's a character eating. Dull and pretentious.All in all this is a travesty. Pompous directing left the characters way down the list to the point of not even being needed. I gave up after 45 minutes as it was going to another 45 minutes which was light on story, light on characterisation and heavy on amateur, over the top, affected direction.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I was also particularly impressed by the way the film was directed, eg use of camera angles, set design and sound track.The script I beleive, was quite short for a feature.

The Coppolas still delivering the goods?,"A middle-aged actor, with his career in its downs, finds himself in Tokyo for the shootings of an advertisement. There, he'll meet a just-married girl, who left everything back in the States in order to support her photographer husband.It seems as Sofia Coppola is trying to prove from the very beginning of her career that she has far more talents than her famous last name. After the almost autobiographical Suicide Virgins, she comes up with a story that is a model for our era. And this is the era of easy solutions, of emphasizing on body pleasures and on the unconditional expression of feelings. She is dealing with a love story that many people would think that has never existed, just because there weren't any physical proves. But if there's a reason that makes this movie so special, is exactly because it portrays all these things that would never happen in front of our eyes, the things that no one would say, but all of us feel in the inner part of ourselves. Inside one of the most crowded cities of the world, our heroes feel more lonely than ever before. They find on each other the compassion they seek, not just because of the same language, but because they share something deeper. They both are face to face with life's choices. It doesn't matter that she's in the beginning and he's in the middle of the course. The circumstances are the same.Although Coppola is touching perfection as far as the script is concerned, from a directorial point of view she's unable to cover certain weaknesses. In its biggest part, the film is nerveless and the few emotional breakouts of the plot aren't followed with intense scenes. However, these weaknesses are well-hidden thanks to an astonishing Bill Murray. The way he combines a psychotic comic personality and a gloomy tragic character in the same role is admirable. Johansson also shows that she has a lot to give in acting, as long as she continues with the series of great choices that has so far made.Lost In Translation, without coming up to the unprecedented reaction that the movie spawned to critics all over the world as it ain't The motion picture event, it can easily excite the viewers with its melancholy, humour and lyricism.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Massively over-rated.,"It astonishes me that so many people would love a film where nothing actually happens at all. The reason is simple-most people rightly love Bill Murray, and Scarlett Johansson has a growing reputation. When the chap is wavering about watching the film, she is thrown in as a bonus, and he agrees to see it. From there, once a film acquires a reputation as undeserved as this, it is almost compulsory to love it- the middle classes sit around their dinner tables, and all smugly agree how good it is, no matter what they actually think of it.I am angry that I have seen this film, and I am angry that it is so popular; it simply reflects how low our society has sunk, and how little we expect from popular entertainment.The 'R' word should not be lightly thrown around, but as well this film being extremely annoying, I wonder if I am alone in being very disturbed about how disrespectful the movie is to Japanese society and culture?",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy

One of my favorite movies,"Well, this is weird. Not the movie, me loving it, because I am a manly man (I think I am at least) I like movies with violence and nudity. What people don't know is that movies with a great story and characters are my favorites. So let me tell you why I love this one. First of all I hate the same exact love story over and over again. Which is why I like this one, it focuses more on Bob and Charlotte's relationships instead of when will they kiss, when will they do it, when will they have the liar revealed story. The two characters are the most important part. Most people who don't like this movie complain about the beginning where they just walk around lonely. I feel it helps the viewer feel like the characters, lost and out of place. The cinematography is some of the best, Sofia Coppola really took advantage of Japan's beautiful scenery. The thing that surprises me the most is Sofia Coppola 's directing ability, she is the woman people were mad at in the Godfather part three. She surprised me, I can't wait to see what she'll do next.

"Worth seeing, but not spectacular...","This film is about the bond developed between between two people while spending time in Tokyo.  Both characters seem somewhat confused about life, and this seems to be what draws them together.  Overall, I thought this was a good movie, but not a great movie.  The performances by Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson were wonderfully executed.  I often got the sense that I was not watching two actors exchange dialogue, but instead was eaves-dropping on a real conversation.  The film was creatively shot and visually interesting.  There were a couple of very funny scenes, but I'm not sure if I would classify this movie as a comedy.Ultimately, the positive attributes mentioned above could not make up for a lackluster story.  I found neither character to be particularly likable in the end.  I found the brief glimpses of Japanese culture to be one of the more interesting aspects of the movie.  The story largely ignored this.This movie is worth seeing, but in my opinion was a bit over-hyped. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
lost in transition,"Travelling for work, staying in cookie-cutter hotel rooms, negotiating soul-crushing airport transit lounges, enduring forced bonhomie in stilted conversations with people we hope never to see again...Modern working life alienates and dehumanizes us on distant shores. At times like this, we may reach out and take succor in a human connection that could only be forged in such circumstances. Lost in Translation depicts one such connection.Charlotte and Bob meet in Japan. Some aspects of that arena are conveyed in ludicrous, hilarious detail - the uninvolved translator, the kitschy hotel lounge, the indecipherable menu. Other details are less well conveyed, such as a cringe-inducing and borderline racist depiction of a Japanese call girl. But the fact is this could be Dubai, or Bangkok, or Mexico City. Two troubled individuals wash up in an unfamiliar and alien land without the will or skills to navigate their way through. The landscape they explore is their own under-realised lives. They give each other the strength to go on.Subtle but powerful performances from the two leads, and an understated but steady hand from Coppola, make this a fine achievement. Some wonderful comic moments, especially a hospital encounter between Murray and a local that was surely ad-libbed, are finely balanced with pathos and emotional depth.

"Very funny, never Hollywood romantic","If you're surprised by the subtleties of Bill Murray's acting here, then you can blame your surprise on most of his previous directors, who always had it available to them but rarely chose to showcase it. Sofia Coppola's direction dips its toe in a documentary style that compliments well her script, which never verbalises what doesn't need to be. With this approach, Murray and Scarlett Johansson are left to show us a hesitant relationship whose only foundation is a shared feeling of being lost in life's choices; of having no direction and no one else around to understand them. This is a film that captures boredom, that explores companionship, and that recognises the need for a special moment being left as just a moment. Very funny, never Hollywood romantic and almost constantly affecting, once this arrives on DVD it could well be a film to wallow in on the sofa.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A movie for those who love to suffer silently,"Am I missing something?I love Bill Murray, and Scarlett Johanssen is maturing into one of the better new stars, with a delectably ""human"" shaped figure and expressive face.  You have solid direction and cinematography displaying a tapestry of Japan's pop culture.  Maybe it was a poor plot that failed to inspire.  No, couldn't be that, because there was no plot to speak of.Without giving away whatever plot outline there was (because an actual plot was non existent), Bill Murray was the cliched rich guy who long ago settled in to a married life that was depressingly mundane at best. Scarlett Johanssen played the very bored, bright educated young woman who seems early on, to have surrendered any personal direction in life.  Rather she chose treding time as an appendage to her vocationally preoccupied equally young husband.  In short... a future divorce waiting to happen.These two environmentally alienated people meet in an unfamiliar environment and slowly grow on each other.  It seems that neither can sleep, probably because deep down, they realize that life is ticking by like an old regulator clock with a broken chime.  In some ways, you might say that Bill Murray's character sees Scarlett as the embryo of his present existence. Scarlett bonds to Murray for a taste of her own developing life drama.Yeah... so what.  If you're a teenager with limited witnessed time on earth, all this might seem intriguing.  But in fact, if you strip ""Lost in Translation"" of its Japanese environment and planted it in Chicago, or Atlanta, or Boise or anywhere else, it would be crashingly dull.Funny Part: The Japanese hooker.  Earlier funny part: Long winded director of a whiskey commercial.Tasteful Theme: No gratuitous sex.When the film was over, my wife and myself scratched out head, because there really wasn't an ending in the true sense of the word.  But then again, there wasn't a beginning or a middle either.For very good acting, direction and cinematography, I give Lost in Translation a generous 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
An uninvolving experience,"I'm a big fan of Bill Murray and have a diverse range of film interests, but I found this critically acclaimed movie shallow, empty and, above all, pretentious.Basically its about two people (Bill Murray's washed up actor and Scarlett Johansen, whose photographer boyfriend is in town working) who are ""trapped"" in a city (Tokyo) most of us can only dream of ever visiting. What ticks me off about the movie is the way in which this ""predicament"" is presented as being a bad thing and, not only that, but the entire film is based around the idea that the city is boring, not to mention implying all Japanese folk are idiots.Aside from several gags early on (one particular scene involves Murray's character being repeatedly shouted at by the director although what he actually says is very little) I found very little to be able to class this as a ""comedy"". By about the halfway point I was struggling to stay awake, the introduction of Anna Faris's annoying character further increasing the woe.Were it not for Ms Coppola's relation to a well known director, I don't think this movie would have been made in the first place.

Shining Example of the Beauty of Silence,"How often do you watch a film these days, and truly appreciate the silences? Those moments when you're forced to truly look to the characters' faces, their glances, their quirks, to read the characters' minds.  Even the great American directors of our day -- Spielberg, Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorcese -- tend to focus more on either dialogue or on sound and images separate from the characters to make their point.  Yet how much of our daily interaction with those we know and love (and even those we don't) derives from just those types of silences.That's what makes a picture like ""Lost in Translation"" so special.  Scarlett Johannson and Bill Murray spend a substantial amount of time together, and yet it's remarkable how little dialogue they actually have with one another. Instead, the bulk of their scenes together consist of silences in which the entire span of their relationship -- their semi-awkward meeting, their recognition that they want to spend time together, their growing sense that there is a mutual need that each fills for the other -- is reflected on Murray's and Johansson's faces.The plot of the film is not all that complicated: burned-out popular actor Murray is in Tokyo to do a Japanese whiskey commercial for $2 million; Johansson is in the same hotel staying with her husband (Giovanni Ribisi), a photographer spending so much time on the job that he has no meaningful time to spend with her.  The film is about Murray and Johannson crossing paths, and making each other's lives more enjoyable for the few days they spend together.The importance of their silent relationship is not difficult to see. Compare their scenes together with those between Johansson and Giovanni Ribisi (as her husband) -- these consist mostly of talk (primarily Ribisi) and yet there is no sense of connection between these characters.  There are numerous other examples, although three are particularly worth noting: (1) Anna Faris as a bubbleheaded movie star who talks constantly and says nothing; (2) a hilarious scene in which a Japanese director, who is shooting Murray in a whiskey commercial, apparently needs thirty seconds of dialogue to say ""turn your head to the right""; and (3) Murray's sad telephone conversations with his wife -- words can't bridge the distance when personal contact is absent.   In their scenes together, it's clear that Johansson and Murray are relying exclusively upon what their eyes, their gestures, their smiles, and their expressions can tell each other.And none of this would work without two outstanding lead performances. Johansson is subdued, yet radiant, as a young woman whose mind and spirit are incredibly vibrant, but has been beaten down by the needs of her husband and his friends for idle noise, masquerading as conversation.  Murray is remarkable in a performance that, as in ""Rushmore"", transcends Murray's familiar persona and blossoms into a real performance.  Indeed, if you follow his progression from ""Groundhog Day"" to ""Rushmore"" to this film, the development as an actor is exciting to watch (now, try to imagine if he did ""The Razor's Edge"" today, instead of twenty years ago).These two actors are guided along beautifully by Sofia Coppola's direction, which beautifully transposes the noise and expanse of the outside world -- where neither Murray nor Johansson truly fit -- and their own intimacy.  She avoids the common inclination of many directors to quickly push the relationship in a sexual direction; instead, she chooses to focus more on how these two characters fill the respective voids in each others' lives.Nothing about the choices in this film (either from the actors or the director) is ""safe.""  After all, how many directors would make sure that what is ostensibly the most romantic dialogue in the film is inaudible to the audience?  And yet, doing so makes all the sense in the world -- the characters have been so intimate all along, and yet we've been privy to their feelings.  It only seems right that they be allowed to share just one thing between themselves, and themselves alone.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Charming Story of Friendship,"'Lost in Translation' is a poignant film that deals not with mid-life crisis, but life crisis at any age. Whether it be the aging action-movie hero (Bill Murray) or the young newlywed college grad (Scarlett Johannson)--feeling lost happens throughout life. Writer and directer Sofia Coppola captures this delicate story in the sometimes chaotic surroundings of Tokyo Japan. While the characters are literally lost in a sea of cultural differences, these differences are metaphors for the harder to articulate feelings of being lost in life. Sometimes the dialogue and flow of the film are lacking, but there is something to be said for a director that chooses silence over redundant dialogue. Filled with charming and well-delivered scenes by Murray and Johansson, 'Lost in Translation' is a touching story, ultimately about friendship.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Nothing is lost, everything is gained","As a writer/director, Sofia Coppola is endowed with the wonderful gift of confidence - she is able to resist the insecure temptation to over-tell her stories, opting instead to allow the characters and the situations to unfold organically and naturally, without artifice, heavy-handedness or contrivance.  She achieved this in The Virgin Suicides and she takes this concept even further here, managing to create superb emotional resonance that rings true in every frame.Bill Murray's quirky talents have never been better utilized; Coppola inspires him to give a stunningly restrained performance, letting his true subtle mastery shine.  And Scarlett J. is wonderful here as well, infusing Charlotte with just the right amount of desperation without letting her become a victim.

A flick of genius,"Lost in translation lives up to its name for best picture. The scenes, the beauty, everything is captured so wonderfully.Some people might think Lost in translation is lacking the notion of a plot.But please do not misunderstood, basically the movie speaks about two people isolated and lonely, trying to find company in each other's hand. And that's what it's trying to convey to the viewers. And the feelings are expressed in what viewers might think 'lacking plot' scenes.I have to comment on one fabulous scene where Charlotte sits facing the hotel and the camera just zoom around her and the city. Here, we can all feel's Charlotte's pain and loneliness. And i think that is one hell of a film that trys to touch people's heart, and succeeding. It gives a feeling of 'this girl lost in this big city' feel.Bob and Charlotte just wanna be friends, they just want to know they are not alone. And japan's spiritual traditions and their living in also captured in this film.What more do u want in a film? This film has it all!! The beauty, the culture, the friendship, the love, the loneliness. And even the veteran actors. Even at 17 (or 18), Scarlett johansson captures a 25 woman so well, and this is why she's one of Hollywood's up-rising star.So please think again if u think this movie is lacking a plot.2 thumbs up for the best film of 2004!!!!

A visual and aural film that conveys emotion with images and acting rather than plotting and characters,"As is aptly covered in many of the other reviews on this website, Lost in Translation is very much a love-it or hate-it film. I know a lot of people find it boring and pointless and generally just a huge waste of time, but it's my favorite film of all-time. I catch my fair share of flak for gushing like a schoolgirl about how much I love the film, with people accusing me of being pretentious or a film hipster or whatever for liking it. Rather than retread ground already covered by the thousands of review on this website, I thought I'd cover why the film appeals so much to me in particular rather than trying to analyze it from a more objective perspective.There was a blog entry (http://marc-mike- movies.tumblr.com/post/47911260711/a-moment-stretched-to-eternity- sofia-coppolas) I came across not too long ago that really describes why I love the movie so much:""Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation (2003) is one of the great mood pieces of recent cinema, a wise, tender, and melancholy delineation and evocation of what it means to be 'stuck,' to be adrift both in a foreign land and in life. It depends not on narrative, but on feeling, on compositions that express more than a thousand words could. We see in certain scenes, and even certain glances, a range of emotional terrain effortlessly conveyed by the remarkably controlled acting given by a never better Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson.Consider this scene (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsj9sMDgh-A), begun after a night away from marital issues, crisis, and existential ennui. To describe it would take away its magic. But what makes it so magical? It is a short sequence. Nothing really happens. And the scene doesn't call attention to itself in any self- consciously artistic way. Why then is it so effective? Perhaps it is simply Johansson's face that sells it so well. Perhaps it is for the evocative music of My Bloody Valentine. And perhaps it is for what the scene itself evokes: those respites from a life of uncertainty, basking in a moment that you wished could stretch to eternity, taking it all in before it's gone. Coppola captures those moments of bliss that we've all had, and we all cling to, as well as the knowledge that they can't possibly last forever.""And the film is packed full of scenes that affect exactly as the one listed above.I've seen thousands of films in my life thus far and it's my absolute favorite of all-time. It's the only one I can watch repeatedly and never get tired of. Something about the way the movie makes me feel when I watch it is what attracts me to it. The dialogue, photography, lighting, and score all combine to give it this ethereal, relaxing, and slightly melancholy feeling that I can't get enough of.I watched it literally dozens of times last year, so I specifically made a deal with myself not to watch it at all through 2014 in order to keep myself from potentially getting sick of it. If that's pretentious, then I guess I'm a pretentious man. But I'm not going to stop watching this movie several times per year... Beginning in just a few days.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Why is this a film?,"What actually happens? I had a day like this 3 weeks ago. No one critically acclaimed that. If I wanted to see some one make a friend and walk around I'd watch some CCTV. Who cares if it was a good acting performance and great chemistry etc? They didn't even really become friends, just sort of knew each others names. I think almost everyone in the world has experienced making a friend, I want to see something in a movie I can't quite achieve myself. It is not at all entertaining. I would like my few hours back, because I could probably have an experience more worthwhile than Bill Murray's character had in this film in that time.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Cannot understand what the fuss is about,"Watched the DVD. I didn't care for this movie. Then (as usual) I began to doubt my own sanity since ""the whole world loves this movie"". I came to IMDB 'User's Comments"" and was very comforted to see that others felt as I do. I cannot fathom why Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanson got mentioned in Best Actor categories. As someone else pointed out, he acts just like Bill Murray. The first thing I noticed about Scarlett was her puffy lips, then later I noticed that she seems to be trying to look like Uma Thurman. But best actor? And the story ... I guess I feel very let down, and have a strong sense that the story could have been much better.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Locations in Tokyo and Kyoto?,"Lost in Translation is one of my favourite (this is how we spell it in Australia) films. Interesting to see that someone has compared it to Wong Kar-wai's sublime In the Mood for Love. In the Mood for Love was the obvious comparison for me too. However, I don't see it as a rip-off, but rather enjoyed the similarity of the themes of what is left unsaid between the characters or not revealed to the audience. What better location than Japan for a script imbued with such subtlety. The contrasts between the traditional and modern Japan were handledbeautifully. I loved the scenes in the shrine near Tokyo and the temple in Kyoto but which ones were they? Does anyone know?",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Should have seen it sooner,"Lost in translation is the story of two people who are stuck. At first glance, it appears that our two characters have a comfortable, rich life; but as the story progresses, we see that they lack the spark in their life.Scarlet Johansson puts up the performance of her life. Never before have I seen her act in such a delicate and touching way. Her emotions and her expressions are spot on during the whole film and she portrays a likable, smart, sexy character.Bill Murray is Bill Murray. He brings a fantastic comical side the story; one that's funny and sad at the same time. His performance is fantastic as always and draws the viewer into the character.The film begins with a really odd shot: Scarlet Johansson's ass. I personally thought it was delightful and its quite a nice surprises for the beginning of the film. All throughout the film, we see really nice shots of Tokyo and its landscape and the people.The language barrier that the characters of the story feel can be felt and seen by the viewers as well, so it gives that since of reality that we're really submerged in Tokyo's environment with the other characters. SJ's character is newly married and has moved to Tokyo with her husband who is a photographer. The issue here is that her husband is a work- orientated person. Therefore SJ is feeling lonely in a city where she does not know anybody and has trouble communicating because of the language barrier. BM's character is a famous Hollywood actor who is in Tokyo to shoot a whiskey Ad and get paid 2 Million dollars. But with all his fame and money, he still seems stuck and bored. It's an enjoyment to watch these two people find each other and start to connect and build a relationship. You better agree that it's an enjoyment, because that is pretty much all that happens in the film. The movie has a slow pace and all we get to see is this two people building a relationship. You might think to yourself: ""that's the most boring plot ever created"" and you could be right, but I personally found a delight to watch and I can honestly say this is the one and only romantic movie that I truly enjoyed. Fantastic directing combined with fantastic directing gives you a 5 star film.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Great Film!,I lived near Tokyo from 1985 to 1987 and I was struck at how Ms. Copolla captured the mood and texture of the city - I felt like I was there!  The character development was outstanding and the acting impeccable - a taught character study for the thinking viewer.  Just great!,8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Lost in Japan, in culture, in language, in themselves.","What a refreshing movie that presents another perspective in experiencing a cultural crash to bring along the language as an ultimate communication tool. Or yet, can we probably make it without even speaking a word in that foreign language? As an ESL instructor, I love to show this movie to my students as a vehicle for them to value how important is to learn a second language while applying the cultural context as an important complement to understanding meanings. However, something else goes beyond linguistics in terms of feelings, emotions, and psychological crisis between two people from different generations in a bonding and desperate self discovery. Well, the end will let us think and my students always talk about it with interest and lots of words.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Less is really less,"After watching this film, I came away the idea that everyone who liked this film had woke up with a horse's head the next morning.  The dialogue was downright pathetic and so was the acting.  The ""look-how-quirky-the Japanese-are"" was as unoriginal as it was boring. Bill Murray has done the same character for all of his recent films, some of which his character was better suited such films as  Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums by Wes Anderson. Scarlett Johansson has the same shtick, pout her lips, say very little, and hope that people don't notice she really can't act.  For a character supposedly being a Yale graduate in philosophy, one would think they would show they had actually learned something.  Did people actually believe Ribisi was a) her husband; b) a photographer on assignment in Japan? I actually thought he was her little brother.  This film should have never been nominated for any of the awards, much less come away with best screenplay.  That award should have gone to American Splendor, a far better film about two people in a relationship, and with far better dialogue and story.  It seems like Sophia believes that understatement is the way to fool the critics by letting them believe there is more to her, but I do believe by the next film, they will be shocked to the lack of talent and depth in Sophia's film-making.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A great must see movie!,"This too was a hard movie to figure out. It's not quite a comedy but it's not quite dramatic either. It lies comfortably in between the two.Though the plot, Bill Murray's career slump and Scarlet Johansson's marriage, are somewhat dramatic, there are some great hysterics. Whether it is Murray trying to master the treadmill or understand what the photographers are attempting at saying or Johansson's cynicism with listening to self help CDs or discovering cross-gender pseudonym and making sarcastic attempts at revitalizing her fresh and failing marriage to a photographer.The movie starts with Scarlet Johansson laying on a sheet less bed with nearly see-through underwear.The movie starts (some may say at a slow pace) when Bill Murray is shooting a commercial for Japanese liquor after establishing the fact that he is a now failing action actor.Down the hall, Charlotte (played by Johansson) struggles with her marriage. After only graduating last spring from Yale for psychology, Charlotte seems to be looking forward to wait for her husband to return in the dark of night after numerous photo-shoots.As luck, and irony, would have it the two meet while Murray drinks the alcohol he is promoting. They form an odd friendship when Charlotte takes Bob (played by Murray) to a hip Tokyo club-party.After other adventures into strip clubs and bad karaoke parties the two have their first fight in a sushi restaurant. The character development is wonderful and their relationships shine with a country of extras and two shining stars.Sophia Coppola, who also directed the 2000 instant indie hit The Virgin Suicides (based off of the best selling novel by Jeffery Eugenides), establishes herself not only as a great indie film writer/director but an all around great film maker. Coppola's writing is wonderful with a satirical plot and funny scenes. She has great character development and takes on writing an uncommon and simple friendship between the two characters that seems so right.The movie is something to see and should not be missed. It is a movie for not only independent film goers but major film goers as well. The movie hits ultimate status and can dance on your heartstrings and in your inner most emotions. This movie also establishes Scarlet Johansson at a higher status than she was before and she is one of the most beautiful actresses of our time.The final scene is nothing that you would expect from a romantic comedy/drama but that is because it isn't a romantic comedy/drama. It isn't a romance movie at all in the sort of accepts that we are used to. When we hear 'Romantic movie' we think of a sensual love between to people sexually attracted to one another. But in this movie the romance aspects is above that and is a link between two unlikely friends with a friendly love between one another.Grade: A : This movie is a touching movie with the 'Long ways from home' feel. Of course, with Bill Murray as one of its stars, the movie has to have some mild, inner laughter comedy. The movie is a must see and should not be missed by anyone.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Poetic Photography,"This is a film about loneliness. I haven't seen another movie where loneliness was portrayed with such subtlety and frankness. It is like every scene of the movie is like a ""lonely still photograph"". Sofia Coppola manages to show us photography embedded into cinema. If you watch it carefully you can actually print photographs of scenes into your mind, and can later look at them and see how they come together and build a story about being lost in a remote, noisy, strange world. You can also see a story about a man and a woman who find something that can be described as a flow of mutual emotions without using words to describe them. Sounds poetic, doesn't it? Well, thats what Sofia Coppola has achieved with her directing: Poetic Photography. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Enigmatic Emptiness.,"Lost in Translation is an anomaly to cinema, at least the cinema that I know. So much can be said about it and yet so little needs to be. There is an allure within the world created by Sofia Coppola that is entirely unique. I can't say I remember very many specific 'parts' or particularly memorable pieces of dialogue, despite having seen it on a number of occasions. I am, however, almost endlessly drawn to the near-enigmatic nature of what does happen, perhaps because it is so easy to relate to. Of course I'm not implying that I empathize with Bob's actual character, but rather, I feel connected to his plight (or lack thereof).If you've ever wandered your neighborhood alone in the early morning hours and felt somewhat indifferent to the world, there may be a small part of either of these characters locked inside of you somewhere, longing to find someone that shares your own troubling sense of apathy - someone that may also lend you a whisper, a bittersweet sense of hope, and a truly private moment that would have the potential to make everything a little more bearable.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
My Favorite (so far) of the Decade,"It's probably predictable that some people would watch Lost in Translation and say that the emperor is wearing no clothes. Films like this, which bring wild applause, media hype and an original means of delivering the message are often ridiculed by those that don't get the point as being all fluff and wankery. Lost in Translation was never made to please the masses. It doesn't involve one car chase, puts emotion over lust, and forces you to think for yourself as to what is going on in the characters' minds. Deal with it.Bill Murray is Bob Harris, an aging US movie star traveling to Japan to endorse Suntory Whisky. Clearly his life has seen more interesting phases, and he's only here for the quick and easy cash payoff, but Bob doesn't really need the money, and he sure as heck doesn't need to be sitting around, alone, in a Tokyo hotel while his wife faxes designs for his new office furniture for his approval.Up a few floors, a different story is playing out. Scarlett Johansson is Charlotte, a bored young wife of a boring young rock photographer (Giovanni Rbisi). At some point she obviously thought this artiste she's married to was a creative genius, but as his career takes off and his attentions wander to movie star Kelly (Anna Faris), Charlotte begins to lose it altogether. Alone in her hotel room, listening to self-help tapes for some kind of inspiration, she and Bob meet and something begins to brew.At this point, your typical Hollywood writer/director begins the passionate lust, the secret meetings, tongues in ears and boobs in cameras. But Sofia Coppola has shown, not least of all with her first big directing outing, The Virgin Suicides, that she's not a cookie-cutter director. Lost in Translation is full of dialogue that you don't hear, voices that say nothing, and emotion that is kept inside. And that's what makes it great.Look, reality is far different from a Ridley Scott movie. While most films are made with a rule in place that if it isn't said, it doesn't exist, audiences aren't always requiring such things out of their stories. I don't need Bill Murray to say ""I'm sad and lonely and, though I can't have you, I really enjoy pretending that maybe I can,"" out loud, I can see it in his darn face when he looks at Scarlett Johansson across a karaoke box. And that is something I respect, because it respects ME enough to catch it, without shoving it down my throat.Lost in Translation is consistently funny, consistently sad, consistently impressive and spooky. The music is a film in itself; I can say this, because I've listened to it on repeat for almost a week and I'm not sick of it yet. But it's the quiet moments, when nothing at all is spoken, that appeal to me the most. Watching Murray and Johansson engage in an across-the-bar conversation without moving their lips is the stuff that only a daring filmmaker would write, and only a nutbar would put to film. Thankfully, a daring nutbar filmmaker is simply a long way of saying 'a genius' and, in my opinion, that's Sofia Coppola down to a T.Shot on location for less than $4m, this is the kind of film-making that inspires generations of up and coming filmmakers to copy. Like Linklater did with Slacker and Smith did with Clerks, Lost in Translation will bring in the new wave of young filmmakers who realise the power of emotion and introspection and the audience thinking for themselves. And I, for one, can't wait.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Dazzling Wisp Of A Film,"David Lean's unforgettable 1946 film ""Brief Encounter"" set the standard for cinematic love stories concerning characters who meet by chance in way stations, be it the dingy train depot in ""Encounter"" or the austere luxuriousness of Tokyo's Hyatt Hotel in Sofia Coppola's new movie, ""Lost in Translation"". Nearly 60 years separate the two films and yet they share a kinship that makes both films unique. Unconsummated love is not a popular subject among today's screenwriters and even a classic on the order of ""Brief Encounter"" was met with some derision by critics and audiences alike. Seen in 2003, ""Brief Encounter "" still has the power to grip audiences with its tale of an unhappy suburban wife and mother who fatefully meets a London physician while waiting to take an afternoon train home and starts a timid affair with the man, himself married. Furtive meetings ensue until the woman , racked by guilt and self doubt, ends the relationship. In 90 minutes of sublime film-making, master director Lean transported his World War 2 audience into a world of newfound love, simultaneously exciting and dangerous and finally heartbreaking in its finality. A deceptively ordinary story of two ""ordinary' people was made riveting through brilliant directing , acting, editing, scoring and sound.Sofia Coppola's ""Lost in Translation"" does not reach the artistic level of David Lean's masterwork but it is a very good movie. From its ravishing opening shots of nighttime downtown Tokyo as observed by Bill Murray in a cab to the closing shot of another cab speeding away from the city leading Murray to the airport and home, this new film consistently engages the audience's attention, even when the screenplay seems almost non-existent. An American movie star in Japan to film a whiskey commercial, Bob Harris (Murray) arrives in a jet lag stupor from which he never seems to fully recover. Ensconced in Tokyo's spacious but sterile Hyatt Hotel, Harris gets only a fitful night's sleep, then arrives at the studio the next morning to film his whiskey commercial. This sequence, one of several, showcases Murray in spectacular fashion. An increasingly frustrated Japanese director and a genial translator try to convey to the American actor what they want in the scene. Murray's reactions are priceless. His performance in the entire film is a marvel and the best acting he has ever done.Complimenting Murray beautifully is Scarlett Johannson as Charlotte, the young American wife of a roving photographer of a rock band. The couple is also staying at the hotel, with husband John often away on assignment. Lonely Charlotte, feeling neglected by John, meets Harris one night in the hotel bar, and an innocent friendship results. Harris is nearly 30 years older than Charlotte but their May -December romance is wistful and consists mostly of late night talks, spur of the moment adventures in the big city and sharing a bed fully clothed back at The Hyatt. Through all this director Coppola casts an observant but unobtrusive eye on the proceedings. The movie is very strong in capturing the cultural differences between American and Japanese sensibilities, often to hilarious affect. In fact Coppola's penchant for concise observation goes a long way in covering for the unsubstantial screenplay, some of it obviously improvised. However, the acting by the principals is so strong, and Ms. Coppola's direction so self assured that the story effortlessly glides along, despite a few detours along the way that threaten to stop the film in its tracks.The crux of the story centers on the Murray/Johannson romance, and it is truly sweet. When Murray converses on his cell phone to his wife in The States, we are privy to enough information to know that the marriage has soured. Charlotte spends a lot of time at the beginning of the film sitting on her hotel window sill, looking down on the vast Tokyo cityscape, her eyes brimming with tears. This is a movie about two lonely souls looking for fulfillment. Technically superb, with dazzling color cinematography, gorgeously ambient sound and an eclectic music score, this loosely structured film ends on a fairly pedestrian note, but even so it is deeply moving.Bill Murray's great performance has a lot to do with that, and he is ably abetted by the lovely Scarlett Johannson. When these two look in each other's eye's, it is the most sensuous sight imaginable.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
beautiful film,"this film by Sofia Coppola was so hyped up, I thought it can't be that good (although I liked ""Suicide Virgins"" very much). But straight from the first shot away I was captured by this great film and the excellent actors, the melancholic but somehow optimistic atmosphere, the outstanding photography, the beautiful Scarlett and a superb Bill Murray. I always thought, how could Bill and Scarlett go together, but they are great. You wouldn't believe that it is an American production if you wouldn't know, sort of european style, in the way of ""A bout de souffle"" by Godard.Next to ""Twilight Samurai"" by Yamada so far the best film in 2004.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Wow!!,"My friend & I had to go out of our way to see this film, as it wasn't playing near us. We got a tad lost, so we ended up missing the first 5 minutes.

Rapturous Masterpiece,"A striking, adult and poignant love story for the modern audience, Coppolla's sophomore effort demonstrates talent, intelligence and art way beyond her years.Everything from the title, the setting, the actions is designed for multiple interpretations and is filmed with such understated brilliance that conveys both the loneliness and the chemistry the main characters are going through.Lost In Translation might not be an easy film, but the way it asks you to discover, interpret and connect with the characters and their silent struggles makes the effort to make sense of it all the more rewarding.
