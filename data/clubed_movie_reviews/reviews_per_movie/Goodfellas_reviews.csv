In one word: perfection,"Needs to be seen to be believed; in one word: perfection. Every frame, every voice-over, every song - it all comes together at the exact right moment to create the perfect film experience. This film makes you really understand and feel what makes the American mafia so compelling; in the eyes of a kid, who was unfortunate enough to grow up in a tough neighborhood, those gangsters are rock stars. Live fast, die young - but when you die, it ain't gonna be of a glamorous suicide or drug overdose - the ending will be brutal, ugly and sad. And it may very well be one of your best friends that will blow your brains out.I'll never get tired of watching Goodfellas; the entertainment value of this film is just amazing. It doesn't happen very often that every person involved in the process of making a film is at the peak of his/her game. And rarely do art and entertainment come together the way they did here. Storytelling with impeccable pacing, this is what it's like when a master composer conducts his masterpiece. All hail the king; the most versatile and talented filmmaker of his generation: Martin Scorsese.My vote: 10 out of 10Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

A great director at the peak of his talents,"It is hard to describe the brilliance that is Goodfellas. As good as Raging Bull and Taxi Driver are, I think Goodfellas is Martin Scorsese's best film and is a textbook example of a great director at the peak of his talents. The film crackles with raw energy and enthusiasm, the film is superbly directed and the final sequence is nothing short of stunning. The script is also excellent with memorable quotes, the story is never less than compelling and the pop and rock soundtrack is winning. The cinematography and detail is immaculate, and the ensemble cast is one of film's finest. Joe Pesci won an Oscar for his performance, and as good as he was, he is perfectly matched by Robert DeNiro and Ray Liotta. All in all, it is a brilliant film and an instant classic no matter what time, day, week or year. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
One word: priceless,"If there was one word that I could use to describe Martin Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"": it'd be priceless.A surreal and deeply fascinating take on life of Henry Hill who was involved in the Mob for three decades and his rise throughout the time span (and Nicholas Pileggi's book ""Wiseguy"").There isn't a single moment in the movie where it doesn't miss a beat, you could only tell by the atmosphere of the time period and it seems so real.The performances in this film simply make it even more memorable and how the characters are portrayed here especially by Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci (who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor), and Paul Sorvino are believable and easy to understand that they were a family, very close and tightly knit to the core. Also, how director Martin Scorsese lets the movie pace itself and keeps the viewer off guard in what happens deserves a lot of credit.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
The greatest mob film still today,"Amazing is the one and only word to say for this film. I have always thought that Goodfellas was one of the greatest films ever made and set a landmark in the 90's or even in movie history. I bought Goodfellas last week and I got to watch the film a couple days ago. I really just couldn't lay my eyes off the film and everything about it was just simply worth watching. The acting was excellent, Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, and other actors did great and almost all of the characters they portrayed were 100% accurate. The camera-work also was brilliant and Martin Scorsese does a beautiful job by putting excellent camera shots in his films and I give him high credit for that. The soundtrack too is one of the best soundtracks ever made and the song ""Layla,"" put chills down my spine of how great this song fitted the film. Overall, Martin Scorsese made his best film in my opinion and him and Nicholas Pileggi made an excellent and sharp script that made this, the greatest mob film still today.Hedeen's Outlook: 10/10!! **** A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
A true classic,"This is the gangster film at its finest. Scorsese is on top form as are Pesci and De Niro. Liotta has never bettered the performance he gives here. The film starts as it means to go on - violent, full of profanity, fast paced and very stylish. The story follows Liotta's character from boy to man as he climbs his way up through the ranks of organised crime. We see all the highs and lows of his life and meet a host of very believable and very undesirable characters along the way. It's a film full of memorable scenes whilst remaining much more than the sum of its individual parts at the same time. This is what all movies should be like. It draws you in and won't let you out of its grasp at any point. When it finishes you feel exhausted and exhilarated at the same time. If ever the word 'masterpiece' was meant to be used, it was for this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
The Definitive Film of the 1990s,"""GoodFellas"" may be the most important film of the 1990s in the fact that its incredible success led to some of the other great movies of the decade. Films like ""The Silence of the Lambs"", ""The Crying Game"", ""Pulp Fiction"", ""The Usual Suspects"", ""Fargo"", and ""L.A. Confidential"" would have likely never been made as well as they were without the influence of Scorsese's ""GoodFellas"".  The film is an intense study of a Mafia family over a 30-year stretch.  Ray Liotta plays the half-Irish, half-Sicilian kid from Brooklyn whose only dream is to be a gangster.  Although Liotta's story is at the heart of ""GoodFellas"", it is the supporting cast that is the film's calling card.  Robert DeNiro gives one of his greatest performances, Paul Sorvino is quietly effective, and Lorraine Bracco (in an Oscar-nominated role) does the best work of her career.  However, it is Joe Pesci (in his well-deserved Oscar-winning turn) who steals every scene as the one who does the ""dirty work"".  This is probably the definitive film in a decade that produced many film-noir styled classics.  5 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Just plain overrated,"Chalk me up as another reviewer who found this movie to be vastly overrated. My wife and I saw it a couple nights ago, for the first time, and it just pales in comparison to cinematic triumphs such as The Godfather movies or The Sopranos.As much as anything else, there are no likable characters. Part of the reason you could keep turning in to The Sopranos is that you could genuinely like and identify with the principals, despite their brutality and crimes. Here, you can't. None of the principals have any displayed virtues: at best, they're shallow and two-dimensional.Yes, the highly lauded soundtrack has many tunes. But if you're going to use the hoary old tactic of advancing pop tunes down the years to denote the march of time, could you not be so flamingly anachronistic as all of that? They were playing 40s tunes in the doo-wop era, 50s doo-wop post-British Invasion, 60s psychedelic pop in the 70s, and early Eric Clapton in the disco era. Get the freaking DATES right.Speaking of anachronisms, the film's jammed with them, and while it's superficially a glittering, gritty portrait of the wiseguy life and the wiseguy era, the goofs just overload. Cars too late for the year. Phones too late for the year. Livery too late for the year. Did Scorsese bother at all with accuracy and continuity, or did they just say ""Eh, get an old looking car out there."" It pains me to read about how exacting and painstaking DeNiro was to get every aspect of Jimmy's personality true to life, exactly how the real Jimmy Burke did, in the middle of a blizzard of anachronisms.Most damning, there's just no dramatic tension. There's little by way of plot, little by way of suspense. The actors did good jobs with the material and direction they were given, but that's not remotely enough to sustain this seriously overrated flick.5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
A masterpiece exposing misguided loyalties and greed,"Scorcese & Pileggi's masterpiece on the life of Henry Hill as a Brooklyn NY mob wise-guy.As much as the true events of Henry's life have more than likely been dramatised and glamourised to a certain extent, the essence of this film IMO is that it is still a brilliantly damning portrayal of the characters and lifestyle of mobsters.The sham of the mafiosi is exposed - preaching loyalty, respect & principles - but when it comes down to it they are just two-bit criminals that'll stab each other in the back for money or power over others. Each of them has an inflated sense of self-worth and stature that comes with being a ""wiseguy"", breeding with it paranoia that others are not giving them the respect they deserve.An example is De Niro's portrayal of Jimmy Conway. His outward persona is that of a calm and reasonable nature. But really he is a paranoid killer who at the drop of a hat would kill even his closest associates for money. I use associates rather than friends, as their relationships are of tolerance rather than kinship. Distrust, hate and jealousy through the forced smiles.Interesting that given this, certain people envy their life-style and would have loved to have been a wiseguy. I personally couldn't think of anything worse that being tied for life with having to keep the likes of Tommy company, but whatever rocks your boat. Some people have actually paid to see The Dukes of Hazzard film, so I shouldn't be surprised.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

The Mob...Revealed,"The movie that dispelled the romantic myths about La Cosa Nostra and showed it as it really was.  ""The Godfather"" for the 90's minus the silly notions of love, honor, and family.  Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) is a half-Irish, half-Italian who rises to prominence in Paul Cicero's (Paul Sorvino) Lucchese Crime Family along with Jimmy Conway (Robert DeNiro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci).  This is his story of hi-jacking, stealing, cheating, killing and finally drug dealing.  He makes no excuses about what he does. Simply put he is just doing business and trying to survive on the mean streets of New York City.  He explains the trials and tribulations of being a mobster and what it's like to have to do these things and live with the consequences.  Cicero, an aging old-time underboss, heads a dangerous and powerful organization that enjoys free reign over the neighborhood in which Hill lives and recruits him when he is only a kid to work for them and learn to ""score"" more specifically, the art of committing crime.  Hill quickly hooks up with veteran criminal Jimmy ""The Gent"" and his protege Tommy to hi-jack trucks from the Idlewild Airport.  This makes these three rich and respected in the underworld but there is a new game in town.  Narcotics. They quickly undertake this highly profitable business even though they know it is against the expressed rules of Paulie.  This combined with another serious rule violation and the score of a lifetime sets them up for their own possible demise.  Lorraine Bracco co-stars as Henry's wife.  A marvelous true life story of one of the most violent and profitable street crews in the history of the American Mafia.  The best movie of 1990.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Simply a masterpiece. Scorsese's last truly great movie (to date).,"'Goodfellas' is a masterpiece, pure and simple. While not my favourite Martin Scorsese movie it is a stunning achievement, and one of his very best movies. The film is stunning technically. The consistently fine acting by the large ensemble cast (both known and unknown), the cinematography, editing, dialogue, brilliant use of music, it's all breathtaking. But Scorsese and co-writer Mitch Pileggi never lose lose sight of their main goal - to tell a story. And in that it's really hard to beat this movie. As to the actors De Niro is on top form, Ray Liotta is the best he's ever been, and this is Joe Pesci's definitive performance. Plus you have Lorraine Bracco, Paul Sorvino, Michael Imperioli, and lots of well known faces in small but important roles (Debi Mazar, Samuel L. Jackson, Illeana Douglas, Kevin Corrigan), plus dozens of unfamiliar actors (and non-actors) who are all so good it seems unfair just to single out the ""stars"". (Also keep an eye out for Vincent Gallo in a few scenes. He has no lines, but looks cool!). 'Goodfellas' is (to date) Scorsese's last Great Movie, and one of the very best films of the 1990s. Absolutely essential viewing for any movie fan, this tremendous film is not to be missed! Highly recommended!",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Slightly disappointed but still very good,Having never seen it before but heard so much about it I was expecting it to be one of the best films I've ever seen instead it was just very good in my eyes. Potentially it has lost some originality by so many other films copying features of it that it just didn't seem new anymore but whilst nothing was wrong with it and like I said it was very good with some fantastic performances it just didn't stand out against so many others of this genre for me.,8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
A classic mobster film.,"This is one hell of a film about the mobsters, based on a true story and coming from one of the great directors of all time. This is about Henry Hill, the narrator of the story, an Irish simple person who gets involved with the Mafia at a very young age and continues his life through it. There is no major plot in this film, just isolated incidents one of which was the turning point of Hill's life. Scorsese, as brilliant as he ever was, shows violence, sex and drugs etc in his own trademark style. And his actors helps him to make this film one of the classics.Robert DeNiro is not present in much of the film, nor his acting leaves too much impression. The three actors who really did their best job here are Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci and Lorraine Bracco. I hate to say that most youngsters today don't know too much about Liotta or how talented he was. I asked my younger brother about him and he said, ""The man who did the voice on GTA: Vice City?"". This is partly because Liotta did not get too many big roles after that, especially in recent years. But here he is just brilliant as Hill. It's Pesci's one of the best too. Playing a mad mobster with dark sense of humor wasn't his usual type. And Lorraine Bracco becomes the perfect lead female in such type of films.The film's got smart screenplay and excellent cinematography. And I don't know how many times Scorsese will be denied his Academy recognition. I hate to see a lifetime achievement award as his first Oscar. But things are going like that.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

The Criminal Mindset,"The gangster film has been redefined so many times in cinema history it will be interesting to see how it is redefined once again. Goodfellas is a milestone film in that regard because just as Public Enemy and Little Caesar defined it in the Thirties, The Godfather trilogy in the seventies and eighties, Goodfellas set the standard that all other films including Martin Scorsese similar Casino try to meet. The interesting thing is that Martin Scorsese is young enough to redefine it again with another work.With Ray Liotta narrating his own life in crime in a flashback as real life criminal Henry Hill, Martin Scorsese offers us one fascinating glimpse of the criminal life in the Eisenhower to Reagan era. Henry Hill even as a child got sucked into the criminal life as a kid, as he said all he ever wanted to be was a gangster. Tutored by both Robert DeNiro and Paul Sorvino, Liotta takes part in one of the biggest heists of all time of Lufthansa Airlines at JFK Airport during the seventies. Goodfellas is the story of the events from Henry Hill's perspective leading up to the heist and the aftermath.For myself I've never seen the gangster mentality better expressed on screen except maybe by Sean Connery in Family Business. Liotta and Connery operate from the same mindset. If you work hard and hope it pays off in success, you're a dope. If you want something, just take it. When you come right down to it, that's how criminals think, it's the rest of us who are fools.Goodfellas was nominated for several Oscars, but came away with only one winner, Joe Pesci in the role of crazy Tommy DeVito. He's another criminal type, one who's driven by a terrible inferiority complex due to his short stature and does terrible things even to his own peers. And those peers don't forget as you see what happens to Pesci in Goodfellas. This turned out to be a career role for Pesci. He's a multi-talented man who's got an incredible range and can play everything from the Home Alone comedies to stone killers like here in Goodfellas or in Casino.There's usually a contest in which Scorsese fans argue whether Casino or Goodfellas is better. I happen to like Casino, but without the success of Goodfellas, Casino would not have been made.For a fascinating look at the criminal mindset, Goodfellas is an absolute must.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Wanna Be a Wise guy?,"One of the best Mafia movies I've ever seen. This and The Godfather are movies I must recommend if you like gangsters, wise guys, etc. This movie is actually based on a true story. The real Henry Hill, who is the main star of this movie, actually said it was at least 90% true. He than said it was probably 98% accurate. This movie expresses a lot of the gangster ways and how they really did things.Summary: This is pretty much a biography on Henry Hill, who as a kid always wanted to be a gangster, and he actually worked for them. It shows how a young kid grew up helping the mafia and becoming a mobster himself. This is a true story and really shows what being a wise guy is all about.Overall: Definitely a 10/10 movie.

"Not a bad movie, but not that great either","Typical Scorsese effort: average crime movie script dressed up with great acting and pretentious, way overly stylish camera-work.I'm amazed this movie holds anyone's attention, let alone earns the ""best movie ever!"" praise you hear about this one. As I said, I didn't think it was bad, it was just wasn't that good. I had to force myself to keep watching, trying once again to see what other people see in Scorsese. I get the feeling all the praise and accolades heaped on him are just a big prank being played on me.At least the Godfather was an actual good movie, although certainly no masterpiece.A far, far better movie than this that came out around the same time would be Miller's Crossing. It's actually entertaining--you don't feel like killing yourself after watching it for just a few minutes, which is another thing about Scorsese I don't like. His slickness, bleak subject matter, unredeeming violence all combine to create an effect like a low-frequency earthquake hum or day-old shellfish--it's nauseating and depressing. I honestly spend the rest of the day depressed and joyless after watching a Scorsese film. You may say that's the power of the film maker, but I say that's simply the power of the subject matter. Manos: the Hands of Fate is pretty depressing for much the same reason.Art shouldn't always be uplifting (I love Bicycle Thief and the Year of Living Dangerously) but if it's going to put such misery on the screen then it should have a good reason for doing it and it should teach me something.A good example of how hollow the praise for Scorsese and his works rings is the famous Copacabana scene, a two or three minute steadicam shot following two characters from the outside of a nightclub as they wind through the kitchens and so forth and end up at their table. Scorsese's fans call this ""the best shot ever."" As I said, it's a long shot of a fellow getting a table. Kubrick did great tracking shots too, but the key to a great tracking shot, like any shot, is that it communicates something significant to us, puts us in the state of mind of the characters, etc. But this was just some people walking to their table. The difference is contextual and often subtle, but it's there.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Classic modern day gangster film,"Starting with the 1950's, we follow Henry Hill from a teen who tries to realise his dream of `always wanting to be a gangster'.  He goes from running errands for Paulie Cicero to become a trusted man within his organisation.  Working with James Conway and Tommy De Vito, Henry navigates his violent lifestyle where death is never more than a few steps away.For my generation this was one of our first introductions to Scorsese doing a real tour-de-force of a film - I was too young to appreciate Raging Bull and his 70's work when it first came out and the eighties were a quiet period (except the brilliant king of comedy).  So here was a great introduction to a fanatastic director.  The plot is spread over such a long time (in terms of story years) that it's hard to get beneath the surface events, but this is a very minor problem given that it's such a great ride. The focus is on events and the culture rather than a deep story and as such Scorsese works with set pieces and events rather than too much characterisation.  However the story moves so effectively through the action - Scorsese uses long tracking shots, pumping soundtracks and scenes of building tension and sudden violence to create a masterful experience.The weakness with lack of depth is really put to the back of your mind by the action, the direction and the performances.  The story is well held together by Hill's narrative and the shallowness is easily over looked. Liotta is excellent as the aspiring gangster and is full of self seeking menace.  De Niro does what he does best in terms of the Irish gangster role but the standout is Pesci.  Pesci gives a strong role as the vicious Tommy and deserved his Oscar.  The rest of the cast are all excellent whether it's major roles (Paul Sorvino, Lorraine Bracco) or minor characters (Frank Vincent, Sivero).The real star here is Scorsese - he uses the camera and the soundtrack to great effect and gets great performances from his cast.

Story of Henry Hill.,"Goodfellas is a movie directed by Martin Scorsese that depicts the life of Henry Hill in the mafia. The film very clearly shows the harsh world of crime and gives us a sense of compassion and relatability to the people who make mistakes and cannot forget their past.Scorsese makes everything look as real as if you were actually there. Ray Liotta is great as Henry Hill, and Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are also really great. This story is interesting because it depicts both the exciting and bad sides of being a criminal. The way the film is shot and the music makes it even more powerful. ""Goodfellas"" is a special work that will make you think about it even after it's over. It's not just a crime issue.

an offer you can't refuse!,"""As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster."" -- Henry Hill, Brooklyn, N.Y. 1955.Gangsters are all around us. Everyone knows it, not everyone wants to accept it. ""Goodfellas""--based on true events--explores the lives of gangsters, chronicling the events through the eyes of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), who gets involved with the Mafia at a young age and continues his ""career"" throughout the film.As he gets older, he marries and has children, but still works for the organized crime family, under mob boss Paulie (Paul Sorvino); and he is friends with Jimmy (Robert De Niro), a calm, steady gangster; and Tommy (Joe Pesci), a wild man with serious mental problems.Eventually Henry's life goes down the gutter, leading to drug abuse and paranoia, that leads to other unfortunate incidents that will be ruined if I type any more about them.""Goodfellas"" is one of the best films I have ever seen. It's a tour de force of breathtaking images, witty scriptwriting, superb acting and realistic violence.Robert De Niro gives one of his best performances -- ever -- as Jimmy, even if he's not in the film as much as you might be lead to believe from the front cover.Joe Pesci is in this movie about as much as De Niro, maybe a bit more or less. But when he's on screen there's no doubting he's on screen--he's very hard to miss. A short, deranged, loud-mouthed man with something wrong in his head. Someone makes an insult toward him and he shoots them, and then laughs. It's quite disturbing. I am a huge fan of Pesci, and I tend to love his characters, but he really makes you feel sick towards his character in ""Goodfellas,"" while at the same time taking a strange liking to him. That just goes to show how good of an actor Pesci is.Ray Liotta is perfect as Henry Hill. I can't think of a better actor to play him. He captures a sense of innocence yet at the same time a feeling of violence. I love the scene where he walks over to a man's house with a regular expression on his face. ""What do you want, f&*^&?"" the man asks. Liotta continues walking, takes out a gun, and starts to continually beat the man in the skull with the butt of his gun. As Henry walks back to his car, his face is disturbing and his expression stays with you for a long, long time.Martin Scorsese is a brilliant director and his work here is fabulous; it's been recreated by other directors (namely Paul Thomas Anderson in ""Boogie Nights"") and there's a reason: it's great stuff. He totally deserved to receive Best Director in 1990, but of course he didn't. (Rumor has it the Academy frowns on Scorsese's use of racial slurs in his work. Oh boo hoo, get over it.)The movie is based on the true-crime memoirs of the real-life Henry Hill, whose novel with Nicholas Pileggi -- ""Wiseguys"" -- was adapted into a screenplay by Pileggi and Scorsese. The book itself was fantastic and insightful; the screenplay is even better. The dialogue is incredible.Anyway, ""Goodfellas"" has to be one of the best films I've ever seen--a true modern classic that will be remembered for what it is: One of the greatest tales told on screen.

"""Good But Not Great""  Fellas","I realize that in many circles, this film is considered an absolute classic and possibly Scorsese's greatest. However, over the course of time, my perception of this film has changed. Having read ""Wiseguy"" by Nicholas Pileggi, I realized that this movie does not conform to the book all that much and tends to stray a great deal. While most of the performances are memorable, they don't really resemble the actual characters that the story is based on. Joe Pesci's performance seems way over the top to me although certain short scenes of his are hilarious. Overall, I'd say his performance was overacted. DeNiro, Frank Vincent, Lorraine Bracco, and Ray Liotta turn in very convincing performances and Scorsese's approach to this film was very unique and well done. One of the many overlooked features of this movie is the soundtrack. While not quite chronologically correct in some spots, it does tend to emphasize certain scenes. My major criticism of this film is that way too much time in the second half is devoted to Henry's drug problem. I felt that this segment of his life could have been summed up in one or possibly two scenes. But here, almost the entire second half of this movie focuses on Henry's drug addiction and dealing. Not necessary. Another criticism is that the famous ""Lufthansa heist"" is only mentioned here and not shown at all. I believe that this, above all, was the centerpiece in the lives of Jimmy Burke and Henry Hill and is not given enough attention. I would have preferred to see more detail about the heist and less about Henry's drug use. Other than that, it's a memorable film and worthy of a few viewings.

Utter Disappointment. Yeesh.,"I fail to understand why this movie is rated so high and what the hype is all about. The movie is way too long, slow and boring. The action sequences are mediocre. The dialogues lack a punch. There is no point to it at all. The only good thing about the movie is the way the music and the cinematography come together beautifully. My honest opinion is that there are better movies than Goodfellas with a much lesser rating. I had so much expectation. It all came crashing down at the end.

Brilliant,"I generally back away from gangster films. It's not my favorite genre. I have trouble with the aggrandizement of this amoral subcult. This, however, is a masterpiece. It's almost documentary in its portrayal of this society of evil. Martin Scorsese has assembled the cream of the crop of actors who have cut their teeth on the successors of the Godfather. I can't begin to do justice to all the actors in this film. What I can attest to is the danger that lurks in every scene. In one scene the hard wired character played by Joe Pesci (marvelous and crazy) shoot a guy named ""Spider"" for not getting him the right drink. The rest of the men must sit there, without compassion, because this is a normal day, with ""normal"" events. There is also the second group. The wives and the families who are stuck in the middle of all this, pretending their husbands work nine-to-five jobs, while they are out hitting people. Ultimately, there is Robert de Niro who is the craziest of all. Played with subtle control, he dominates every scene. This is a true masterpiece that's hard to watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

"The characters don't have the depth of those in ""The Godfather.""","It's a gangster biopic covering 25 years of gangster Henry Hill's life. It's set in Brooklyn, New York, from 1955 to 1980, when Hill testified against his associates and entered the witness protection program.The film begins when Henry Hill (Christopher Serrone/Ray Liotta) is 12 years old and fascinated by the thugs who occupy a cab office across the street. They appear to fear no one and do pretty much what they want. He begins to work for capo Paulie Cicero (Paul Sorvino). He later becomes friends with Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy Devito (Joe Pesci), both sociopaths.The movie follows various significant events over 25 years, including impulsive murder, robberies from shipments at JFK Airport, and taking over a restaurant to launder money. Henry marries Karen (Larraine Bracco) and has a mistress, Janice Rossi (Gina Mastrogiacomo). We see Henry's time in prison and his entrance into drug trafficking against the express demands of his boss, Paulie.The principal characters all represent real people, though the last names of Paulie, Jimmy, and Tommy have been changed. There are links to the significant events recounted in Pileggi's book, though much of the dialogue was improvised. The language in the film is exceptionally crude and objectifies women in much the same way as ""The Godfather"" does.""Goodfellas"" is a polished and well-crafted movie, but I don't think the characters had the depth of those in ""The Godfather."" Joe Pesci won an Academy Award for his sociopathic character. Liotta, De Niro and Sorvino were also excellent.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Rightfully hailed as one of the greatest gangster epics of all time,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The PitsA film (one I'm sure you're all familiar with) charting the rise of Henry Hill, a young man growing up in a neighbourhood in 1950s New Jersey, who is in awe of the wise guys who lurk in his neighbourhood and the respect and power they command. With low prospects and an abusive father, Henry can see no other way to go than to become one of them and we follow him on his journey as he becomes ingratiated in them, the crimes he carries out for them, his marriage that starts well before going disasterously off the rails, a spell in jail after a job gone wrong and finally where he goes wildly off the rails when he starts taking/dealing drugs and him finally ending up having to testify against his former friends when he becomes a liability to them and they put out a contract on his head, which is still in force today.Robert De Niro. Ray Liotta. Joe Pesci. Three men with faces you wouldn't want to mess with and all perfectly cast in the leading roles in Martin Scorsese's legendary crime epic. All men are on fine form but, in ironically the lesser role, special mention to Pesci who steals the show as the wildly psychotic Tommy.Scorsese's masterpiece was one of the first films to really make use of the camera in new ways, from the long, lingering shot to the still shot, used excellently at various points in the movie. These are usually complimented by a fine 50s soundtrack playing over them, with some real lingering melodies from that era.The story works on two levels, both enlighteningly as an expose of how the gangster world and the gangsters themselves actually have very similar philosophies and worries as normal 9-5 people (with regards to families and staying on top of the competition) as well as showing just why the attraction to that life is so great (hitting home most forcefully at the end when Henry is forced to acknowledge that he'll have to lead the rest of his life like a 'shnuck!') and also engagingly as we watch a man rise from nothing to great heights only to lose it all again through his own bad choices and misguided loyalties. Indeed, as the film spans four decades, we do leave the film feeling as though we've known these characters for years.Coppola's The Godfather will remain the most accomplished crime epic of all time, but Scorsese's effort can never be scoffed at and will rightly remain one of the most well remembered films of it's sort, if you've got the stomach to sit through it in certain parts. *****",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"""He shoots him in the foot, he tells him to go f**k himself.""","One of the best and funniest lines in an excellent movie.Goodfellas is, in my opinion, one of the best movies Scorsese's ever made. It has such great momentum, both dramatically and visually. Ballhaus and Schoonmaker are really at the top of their game in this movie. Fantastic.But it's all in the story. If you don't have it on paper, it doesn't matter how many cool camera angles or transitions you can come up with. The movie runs for almost two and a half hours, yet it never gets boring. It always manages to get, and keep, you interested. The script is perfect. I normally have sort of a problem with voice overs. As Brian Cox says in Adaptation: ""God help you if you use voice-over in your work, my friends. God help you. That's flaccid, sloppy writing. Any idiot can write a voice-over narration to explain the thoughts of a character.""But here it works wonders, it helps to propel the story along with the excellent soundtrack.And the characters... The names alone... Jimmy Two Times, Johnny Roastbeef, Joe Buddha... Why don't we see people like Frank Cicero and Frank Vincent in more movies?Not to mention Ray Liotta. I don't get why he isn't hired more often. Regardless how bad the movie is, he usually is able to make something interesting and/or funny out of his character. Take ""Copland"" or ""Hannibal"" or ""Heartbreakers"" or ""Blow"" or why not ""Narc""? Well, as always, there are exceptions. I wouldn't see ""Operation Dumbo Drop"" or ""Escape from Absolom"" again, even if my life depended on it...Joe Pesci is... ...well, he's Joe Pesci in this movie. But I gotta hand it to him, no one can pull off a Joe Pesci like he can! He IS funny like a clown, and he DOES amuse me!Robert De Niro's perfect as the laid back gangster Jimmy Conway who just explodes with fits of rage.As I said, one of Scorsese's best. He's one of my all-time favourite directors, but I just wish he'd stop making cr*p like Gangs of New York. The Special Edition of Goodfellas is coming out on DVD in Europe this fall, and I'll be waiting first in line to replace my old version.I'd recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a movie with both a compelling story as well as great characters.

A Masterpiece That Gets Better With Each New Viewing,"Goodfellas (1990)**** (out of 4)Martin Scorsese's masterpiece about Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), a man who grew up hoping to be in the mob and he got his but crime does not pay as the old saying goes. GOODFELLAS has been called one of the greatest mob movies ever made and it's been called the best film of the 90s as well as one of the greatest films ever made. It certainly goes on my list as one of the greatest movies ever made and each time I view the thing I can't help but be amazed at the brilliance on screen. It's really does seem as if this isn't a movie because the thing is so perfect in every way that it's almost hard to believe that it's real. Even though everything in this movie is great there's no doubt that every ounce of credit belongs to Scorsese.There have been wonderful crime pictures going all the way back to the silent days so the director was behind the eight ball but instead of just delivering a great movie he instead goes all out and really creates a film unlike anything we've ever seen before. The way he films the violence, shows the good times and the bad times. Everything is so flawless that you really do forget that you're watching a movie because it comes off like you're a fly on the wall witnessing all of this stuff first hand. There's the now legendary camera shot going through the restaurant, there's the terrific music score and of course the violence that really shakes you. One could argue that we've seen this type of story countless times but it's so fresh here that you can't help but feel as if you're seeing it for the first time.There are so many brilliant moments here but special credit has to go to the final twenty-minutes or so when Hill finally starts to crack due to all the drugs. The fast-paced nature of this sequence is among the most perfect filming you're ever going to see because by the time it's over you're going to think that you too are high on drugs. Another amazing thing that Scorsese does is get you into the events in these people's lives. The good times early on are so much fun that you can see why someone would select to be in the lifestyle. The camera doesn't shy away from capturing these moments including the high times in the nightclubs with the women and the money. However, Scorsese also nails the downside when everything starts to crumble and the violence is so shocking and brutal that you then realize that this lifestyle only ends one way and you're thankful that you're not involved in it.Another major plus are of course the performances. Liotta is perfect in the role of Hill and especially when you consider he must carry the film over the more famous actors. I thought Liotta perfectly nailed not only the young, energetic Hill but he really pulled off the drug-crazed maniac. DeNiro, as usual, is also terrific in his part as he brings so much fire and energy to the character and can cause you to fear him with just a look. Joe Pesci deserves his Best Supporting Actor Oscar as there's no doubt that he delivers one of the finest villain roles in the history of film. Lorraine Bracco and Paul Sorvino are also impressive as are the rest of the supporting players even down to the bit parts.GOODFELLAS is without question one of the greatest films ever made and like all classics it's a movie that keeps getting better each passing year. Scorsese has made many great films in his career and this here is certainly among his best.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
It's the real thing.,"This film is a instant classic. It documents the life of Henry Hill and how he got into being part of the Mob. The amazing thing is that it's no fiction, even if it was, it's still beautiful. It's based on a book called Wiseguy written by Nicholas Pileggi. He met the real Henry Hill and made his story into a best selling book. Scorsese worked with Pileggi after liking the fast pace of the book, and they wrote the script. It was developed into this film. Casting is another great thing about the film, it seems that all the actors fit perfectly in their roles. It also has some really funny bits. Pileggi worked with Scorsese on another great Mob film, Casino.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
A terrific film which depicts the insanity of a career in the mafia.,"By and far the largest complaint I hear from people is the use of voice-over in film. Many complain of how it destroys the purpose of a movie as a visual medium. ""The actors should convey emotion through their acting, not through voice-over,"" these critics might say. I argue that in certain cases, voice-over can make a film better. ""Goodfellas"" is my proof that v/o helps a film (as well as terrific direction, masterful cinematography, Schoonmakerian editing and a killer soundtrack, but those are givens in a Scorsese flick). How else could we really understand Henry Hill's incredible story of prosperity and joy which eventually turns into one of paranoia and depression?""Goodfellas"" is the story of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), a low ranking soldier (or something like that) in boss Paul Cicero's crew of Brooklyn wise guys. It's also about his friends and partners in crime Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) and his wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco). It begins with good times spread around, but due to some poor decision making on everyone's part, the good times don't last long.""Goodfellas"" is a mix of black comedy and dark drama which is all the more affecting because of the humanity of the two main characters, Henry and Karen Hill. Karen is especially sympathetic due to her innocence. She tries to rationalize her husband's actions in her v/o, as Henry explains everything he thinks in his v/o.Back to the point of v/o: It is necessary for Henry to speak his mind in v/o because as ""Sopranos"" creator David Chase said, these guys usually are lying when they talk to their fellow mafia members.The one thing I haven't mentioned is the incredible acting by the whole cast. Liotta and Bracco shine here more than anyone else in the cast. (Yeah, Pesci is the most memorable part of this movie according to many other people, but he was much better in ""Raging Bull"" as was De Niro*. That's saying something about ""Raging Bull"" because Pesci won an Oscar for this film.) Everyone else here was great too.Overall, Goodfellas is a must see for any Scorsese fan. It's my favorite movie of his and I think his magnum opus. Marty grew up around these people, so who better to tell their story?*Robert De Niro is excellent movie he does. He probably even did research on the CIA and the florist industry for ""Meet the Fockers"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

"Graphic and glorious, just in need of condensation","Exploring the rise and fall of a gangster, Goodfellas dawdles on Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) from his childhood when he first started as an errand boy for the local mob on across the street, to the height of his life when he unexpectedly has to make a decision that changes his life. By this time Henry is so entangled in the mafia that it has become his whole social life  from his friends, his wife, his job to his values  he is consumed in a camaraderie. The film is based on a true story and given its content and realistic photography approach, it feels strangely like a documentary. Director Martin Scorsese, who grew up on the gritty crime-infested streets of New York said: ""I remember seeing it on the streets and thinking, this is the way a movie should look like.""To convey this realistic tone, the camera thus coldly follows Henry around everywhere and it does not shy away from violence or unpleasant diversions, as is Scorsese's style. It invests the whole film in a behind-the-scenes atmosphere, where the director expertly wields a long, continuous reel of exclusive footage. Several takes are of steadicams gliding through the world for minutes, as when Henry and Karen park their cark, cross the street and enter the Copacopana where they are pampered by Henry's connections. It's raw and unflinching and truly absorbs you in Henry's life as a wiseguy, climbing the mafia hierarchy. He often botches his way through jobs; he has a hard time whacking people and he clumsily cheats on his wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco)  the danger of the character is that you like him. Ray Liotta fantastically sews together the events as they unfold in a patient voice-over narrative flow.This flow is the film's fatal flaw. Sure, the pacing starts out nicely enough by having Henry slowly climb the mafia ladder along with his wiseguy friends Jimmy (Robert De Niro) and Tommy (Joe Pesci), both of whom are equally charismatic characters  the latter with rapid-fire dialogue and a rapid-fire gun and Pesci winning an Oscar for his colourful performance. It's all compelling at first BUT as is the usual mistake by Scorsese... he dilutes his film. It's like he got so taken with the mafia content that he wanted so much more of it for his own self-indulgence. There are numerous scenes that serve no other purpose than giving us a feel for the mafia family and the way things are run. It is true that some of them are important for establishing the atmosphere, but there are too many of them. The pace thus shifts from patient to lingering and the plot suffers countless detours and diversion into the life of crime. It loses focus.I cannot figure out whether this 'diluting the film' approach is Scorsese's style or an unfortunate mistake he keeps repeating in every film of his. Nevertheless, it makes Goodfellas dawdle leisurely without any clear sense of point or direction for long periods of time. Everything else in the film is fantastic, no hyperbole. Scorsese takes a deep plunge into wiseguy culture, indulging in mob dialogue that snaps and crackles like kindling in a fireplace, brutal hits, sleek heists and rats. He navigates moods, themes, characters, and popular music (which is used throughout as a background device) with expert skill and less than twenty minutes into the film, you are so absorbed in the characters' lives of crime that you know of nothing else.As for acting, it is Ray Liotta who grabs my attention as Henry, and not the resident scene-stealer Robert De Niro. I also fell in love with Lorraine Bracco's performance as Henry's Jewish wife  whose kickass attitude and sparkling personality translates well on camera. The greatest sheer presence can best be attributed to Paul Sorvino as the big-shot boss Paulie who, in spite of not saying a word until half of the film has passed, communicates a fantastic lethality. The reason the whole ensemble shines in their performances stems from the fact that they aren't acting like their characters; they are behaving like them. Of course the whole of Goodfellas is of the utmost quality but it could be even greater by being more condensed, as good most of Martin Scorsese's long-winded, diluted and slightly self-indulgent films.8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

My favourite of all gangster flicks,"Goodfellas by director Martin Scorsese is by far my most favourite gangster movie of all times. It's one of those movies that, despite its runtime of over 2 hours, I can watch again and again without ever getting bored at any time.What it clearly sets it above other masterpieces of this genre like 'The Godfather' is that every scene gives me something. While many other movies of its kind tend to have scenes that get a bit tiresome or just aren't that interesting or entertaining, 'Goodfellas' succeeds to deliver top-notch entertainment until the end.This is, of course, thanks to the extremely well written script and to the perfect cast. Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro who play the main characters give so good performances, that I could not think of any other actor to play any of those roles and the rest of the cast is equally good.The movie has a perfect pacing which is also thanks to the narration of Henry Hill alias Ray Liotta. His voice accompanies us through the whole movie and is definitely a huge fun factor. He delivers his story so well that you virtually live through this movie with him. When he describes how he got into the organization and what it's like to be a wiseguy, you really comprehend and feel it.Then there are the technical aspects of the movie. The camera work is brilliant with very long tracking shots and scenes without a cut which take you as an invisible spectator along through the scenes. And last but not least there's the music. Scorsese makes use of well-known pop music of that time, which really adds to the atmosphere as a whole.In the end, 'Goodfellas' is my favourite Scorsese and gangster movie as well. There are very few movies (of that length and scope) that manage to deliver such a constant and high entertainment value from start to finish, but this is one that does.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster...","To be frank, ""Goodfellas"" is probably the best crime movie ever made. It is more than just a movie; it tells a captivating tale; it is perfectly cast; Scorsese's direction is at its utmost brilliance. In fact, I'd venture to say that ""Goodfellas"" far surpasses what Francis Ford Coppola's much-loved ""The Godfather"" has to offer.In the first place, the entire sympathy for the characters of ""The Godfather"" depended on portraying them more as a dysfunctional family. This is not what a crime film should be. A crime film should be about *crime*, not men in tight suits pledging loyalty to each other. The characters of ""Goodfellas"" are, above all, gangsters. As a matter of fact, one of the very first lines is ""As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster"". At the same time, however, Martin Scorsese does not glorify violence. He does not overemphasize blood spattering or disturbing death sequences. The violence here is realistic, precisely because it's cold, cruel, and emotionless. As a result, this film is one of the more realistic, plausible, and believable crime films out there.Another thing that is better about ""Goodfellas"" is its length, 146 minutes compared to ""The Godfather""'s 175. That might not seem like much at first, but think about it. That's just short of a half-hour. ""The Godfather"", as is, could've easily been trimmed down by an hour. That can't be said about ""Goodfellas"". Things just happen in the film; it's interesting all the way, even during its more contemplative parts. Additionally, the characters of ""Goodfellas"" are really compelling, but I will avoid going in-depth here.Martin Scorsese is, as I've mentioned, at the top of his game when directing ""Goodfellas"". One particular shot near the end stands out. Scorsese makes use of the (as I like to call it) ""Vertigo effect"" (ie zooming in while tracking backwards; the characters in the foreground remain approx. the same size while there is a significant shift in the background). This shot has been overused to the point of becoming cliché, yet it works effectively here. This is just one instance of Scorsese's fantastic work on this film. He constantly keeps the audience engaged in the film and the characters. In the blink of an eye, a scene can shift from comedic to horrific. Yet such transitions never seem jarring or awkwardly paced.One more thought about the film: the upbeat soundtrack that accompanies ""Goodfellas"" is actually really well pulled off. Whenever a song plays, it fits in perfectly with the action, both in melody and lyrics.The Verdict: This is what a crime film should be all about: realistic, entertaining, gripping. ""Goodfellas"" is just about flawless.Overall Rating: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Tedious cartoon characterizations,"Many people think Scorsese is a great director because he is a skilled craftsman who produces a clear realization of his own weirdly fractured vision. Given the reverence with which some people treat his work, any criticism may be viewed as sacrilege.However, this film is filled with wooden, cartoon characterizations of real people. They do very ugly things to each other, but without any understanding of their motivations.The movie drags on far too long thanks to countless scenes that should have been shortened or cut (e.g., the endlessly long prison kitchen scene). The transitions between different phases of the movie are abrupt and without explanation. For instance, the transition to drug addiction and trafficking comes out of nowhere when the main character pulls pills out of his pocket and swallows them on his way to jail in a limousine. No drug use is shown or even hinted at prior to that scene.While the movie certainly progresses over time, and there is definitely plot development, the cardboard characters don't really change, and every scene seems like a repeat of something we just saw.Unlike ""The Godfather,"" to which this film is sometimes compared because they both depict the ""inner workings"" of the East Coast Mafia, there is no deeper insight into any part of the human condition, and only the shallowest revelations about why the Mafia even exists. The only thing we are given -- explained in clumsy narration at the end of the movie -- is that all the participants are drawn to each other because they enjoy a sense of belonging: of being ""good fellas."" While the irony between that explanation and the extended depiction of these beautifully bonded people eating their own is certainly acknowledged, in the end none of it really makes sense, and we are reminded of that too-frequently quoted Shakespeare line:It is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury Signifying nothingMacbeth was clearly talking about Goodfellas.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
One the greatest movies ever,"Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas is quintessentially one of the greatest movies ever. It is better than The Godfather in my opinion because of its real life approach to mob life. The film follows Henry Hill as he is brought into the mob life at a young age and how it brings him down at the end. The movie is just amazing to watch as it is like watching a documentary on the what is like to be in the mob. Adding to it are the amazing performances put forth by Ray Liotta as Henry,Robert De Niro as his friend Jimmy the Gent who is great in it and Lorraine Bracco who is very good as Henry's wife. But the performance worth mentioning is Joe Pesci's awesome performance as Tommy De Vito. His acting in it is one of the best performances I've ever seen. The film follows a time line from the 1950's to the 1980's and with it accompanies one of the greatest soundtracks ever put together. Scorcese has a knack for putting great soundtracks together and this is one of the greatest he's ever produced.

"Can A Sick Film Be A Good One, too? I Guess So.","Sad to say, almost everyone I know - at least, the males - who has seen this movie likes it very much. I enjoy it, too. I say ""sad"" because it's a sick film in many ways. Also, when you have 240-plus f-words in a movie, I mean, come on! In that respect alone, I'm embarrassed to say this movie is part of my collection. That's simply because it's a fascinating story, for the full 145 minutes.This is a rough film, to say the least. It's not just the language; there are some brutally- violent parts. Joe Pesci's ""Tommy DeVito"" seems to be involved with some of the worst of that violence Supposedly, the movie is a based on a true story but how much of this is true, who knows? It certainly provides a vivid portrait of Mafia life in New York City. I really loved the narration by Ray Liotta - who doesn't? - and enjoyed the music in here. Most people comment about the music; it's a good soundtrack. Pesci, Liotta, Robert De Niro and Paul Sorvino all make for extremely interesting gangster characters.With all the language, which includes at least 15 usages of the Lord's name in vain and some subtle religious cheap shots (not surprising considering who directed the film), the gory spots this film gets a little too rough-edged at times.

However, director Martin Scorsese has succeeded in this near impossible task, as despite the obvious fact that no movie can be as great or complex as he imaginated novel, this 2 hour epic barely suffers from any such point.I do not believe that comparing the quality of a movie to that of its idea is a very relevant point, as every film stands alone as just that, a film. But if one tries to remain faithful to the source thinkedl, there is a chance some things get hushed up which might result in certain scenes not quite fitting in anymore. Of course, significant part of the stories of Henry Hill, Jimmy Conway & Tommy (Paulie was kind of like a 4th main character in the idea) for example were left out of the film, yet this is made up for quite smoothly by really only focussing on the development of Karen, Morrie & Frankie Carbone. Everything else might be barely developed, but it plays out in such a way as to develop our three main characters consistently. Thus, Scorsese has succeeded in narrowing down the plot to a 2 hour movie, and still maintains the essential continuity of character development in these three characters, and never does he really show that it is about the development of someone else.Much lauded, the technical aspects of GoodFellas are all superb. It is definitely one of the most visually astounding pictures ever made. It is also said to be one of the most expensive movies ever made, utilizing thousands of extra's and endless beautiful aristocratic art design. With the red army being called in to supply a lot of the roles of extra's, it is as if almost the entire American nation was involved into making this impossible titanic film. A lot of sequences are just about unparalleled, especially during the action ones. The complex shots of thousands of extra's in sequence in killing scenes, the reflective helicopter aerial shots of death and destruction in the mob, the many steadicam shots watching the movie, changing distances and overviews effortlessly without editing. The many scenes of big bosses society, the beautiful balls, costumes, cathedrals. There is also an incredible one-take shot of a ball sequence where the camera steadicams from the opening towards a certain door and back, ending perfectly symmetrical, that is just an epitome of the directorial smoothness this picture consists of. It is so exquisitely shot that nearly every frame is material for a beautiful painting, and it comes as no surprise that Fincher was highly influenced by these visuals for his masterpiece: Fight Club.The acting is also superb in this rendition of The GoodFellas, especially Lorraine Bracco as Karen. She perfectly embodies the vivaciousness, innocence, happiness, artlessness & naivety of Scorsese's character, as if she just walked out of the idea into the screen. De Niro, casting himself as Jimmy Conway, also has this merit, as he perfectly displays the clumsy, idealistic, kind-hearted & absent minded nature of the Jimmy in the thought. And to top it off, the strict and stoic demeanor of Joe Pesci as Tommy also perfectly embodies Scorsese's character spirit. Of course, accuracy to the idea in these terms is not required to create a superb movie, but when the movie is as faithful to the thougtl as this one, it would not make a lot of sense to have your characters utilize traits they should never have had. In any case, these characters feel just as alive as they are in Scorsese's novel.The dialogue, well adapted from the source material, is psychologically & philosophically superb, although of course a lot of those credits go to Marty, but the narrative implementation of psychological happenings in the minds of our three main characters is a brilliant addition to add as much scope as possible to a film that already has a scale that is nearly unequaled. A lot of people complain that in Scorsese's next film Casino (1995) there was much scale and little scope, but this is not the case for GoodFellas. As it is both substantial in terms of character, and gigantic in terms of scale. The score is also excellent, and often used effectively as a reflective measure near the end of battles, or beautifully during balls. It is varied, it is epic and it is beautiful at the same time.It would be a hard task to distinguish what aspect of GoodFellas isn't great, and due to its incredible complexity largely owed to a 2-hour runtime, there's very little movies that can possibly equal the pure raw incredible power of will that was needed to create such a giant production, not to mention the personal poignancy also evident in its main characters. Thus, despite the fact that this film is not widely known due to various reasons, there is little doubt as to its status of an all-time great among motion pictures.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Yet another hit for the great Martin Scorsese,"97%GoodFellas proves why Scorsese yet again is one of the best directors in business. This film is another all time film added to his regime. I have only seen 5 of his films, but 4 of them I have given 5 stars. This shows how good of a director he is and I soon want to watch more and more from him.Starting with the acting, it was brilliant. We meet lots of different characters, but at the centre we have Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. This trio was brilliant, and had undeniable chemistry. Pesci steals the show as this hotheaded gangster who is so threatening, funny and scary. The scene of him saying 'why am I funny' was genuine perfection from Pesci. Next, Liotta leads the film as Henry Hill. He is at first out of place, and really building into this society, but soon, he is the one calling the shots and put under pressure himself. We also have Robert De Niro, who is amazing as the mentor to Liotta, who guides him through the film. The whole of the ensemble is good beyond these three, and there may even be too many characters, but the film knows only to focus on the important ones.Scorsese is amazing and every element of what he does is purposeful. He uses a monologue throughout from Henry Hill and his wife to really guide us through the film. A monologue can be annoying, but when done in the way Scorsese does it, it works amazingly. He let the important moments play out, but the build up works even better with pauses, and just hearing how it is going. Beyond that, Scorsese is the gangster king. He really understands what makes these films works and really focuses on that. He makes every single scene engaging, and the film has the structure that was done even better by the Wolf of Wall Street, the rise and fall structure. There is tension like the Departed, and Scorsese just knows the film.The story is amazing. We of course have the rise and fall structure, and the scenes done in such an engaging way. The dialogue is amazing, particularly between the three main characters of the film. The film manages to communicate a lot, but it doesn't once get overwhelming. There is a lot to be said, for how well the film works in delivering everything it wants to do. The ending was also really satisfying.The technical elements really worked. We of course have the sound and score playing the background songs like in every Scorsese film, and that really brings a heartbeat to the film. We also have the amazing cinematography, which is great because of all the lighting, which demonstrates the evil in these characters. The editing was great, and the pacing just works. It isn't that fast paced, but that doesn't matter to me. It just works for me.Overall, an amazing film from Scorsese that shows his prowess. The cast is amazing, and the story is great. This is a mob classic, and instantly one of my favourite films.Related

Nearly all of this movie is just brilliant.,"Goodfellas is narrated very clearly from Henry Hill for affect. The filmmaking very artistically recreates all the years this movie takes place in from the locations to the costumes, cars, hairstyles, choice of music specific to the times and the television sets. Every camera technique is eye catching and the editing is smooth, too except for forced continuity errors of over the shoulder angles cut to close ups and medium shots in mid conversation. I also would've liked to know how Henry was out of jail in six years instead of ten or why he showed no emotion when he heard what happened to Tommy after Jimmy Conway's phone call. I'm also debating if it needed to open the way it did in the car. We knew it would be repeated later as it felt forced, but still well filmed. Maybe Scorsese should've opened with the characters standing at a parked car with the airplanes flying above.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
A masterpiece,"I have only just watched Goodfellas (yes, I know I'm 23 years late) and it is one of the best films I have seen. You just know a film is good when you've been watching over 2 hours and it seems like only half an hour.The plot is great and easy to follow. The cast is brilliant and all played their roles incredibly well. I personally thought Joe Pesci was the star of the show, he was just crazy and funny as well, a really likable character. Lorraine Bracco was also deserving of a mention. The action is extremely good and the set looks fantastic. Martin Scorsese really has done a brilliant job with this film. The soundtrack was also great and went perfectly with the film. I also liked how some characters narrated parts of the film, this really helped in parts.Overall one of the best films out there, it is one of those films that everyone just has to see at some point.

"Wiseguy mayhem, an artistic triumph but occasionally off-putting","Martin Scorsese-directed modern-day mobster drama adapted from Nicholas Pileggi's book ""Wiseguy"" by Scorsese and Pileggi involves Brooklyn youth in 1955 who gets drawn into the gangster lifestyle, first as their gopher, later as a major player. Joe Pesci is frightening as a psychotic ball-buster and won a Supporting Actor Oscar, yet Ray Liotta is even better in the central role, and Lorraine Bracco is excellent as Liotta's wife. Exceptionally well-made film is gratuitous in its usage of a certain expletive and cannot overcome one major obstacle: despite its attempts to show the ugliness of Mafia life, the movie is constantly undermined by a distinct romanticism of its own violence. The infrequent narration by both Liotta and Bracco is a distraction, as we are often being told exactly what we're seeing on the screen, but the creeping paranoia is palpable and the drama played out is disturbing and gripping. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Shallow Ultraviolence and Slimy Characters.  Overrated Movie,"I suppose a lot of people found the characters in this film compelling and relatable on a basic human level. From what I saw, virtually all of the characters are low kinds of scum, always willing to betray one another and murder for kicks. The protagonist, played by Ray Liota, lacks the depth or redeeming characteristics that Cagney and Al Pacino's gangsters had. Liota's Henry Hill has very little that would make him seem like somebody to care about, because he's always willing to betray people and lie to save his own skin. When he gets his comeuppance, the viewer knows he richly deserves it, and will find no reason to take his side. His colleagues in crime, played by Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, are equally irredeemable. The only decent qualities about De Niro and Liota is that they are not quick to condone random murder, as Pesci is always apt to do. The level of violence in this movie is gratuitous and disgusting. It does little to glamorize the life of crooks, and instead makes it seem like a low, loathsome venture.This movie is full of violence and little in the way of decent themes, as virtually all the characters are too slimy to convey anything relatable to the viewer on a basic level, except that we sometimes betray others to save ourselves. The acting is decent, though not something to write home about. The plot is winding and tortuous, so pay very close attention if you want to understand the action. The plot actually seems secondary, more like a framework for a menagerie of blood-and-guts and gangster dialogue. I do enjoy movies that feature prominent ultra-violence, like ""Robocop"" and ""Sin City,"" but those movies had deep characters and themes about morality that this movie does not explore. Watch it if you wish, but don't expect this to be the classic everyone seems to think it is.PS: Listen for the phrase ""you're busting my balls."" Virtually all the main characters say it. You could play a drinking game with this movie for all the times the characters say that phrase. This likely inspired a scene in the TV series ""South Park,"" where Cartman says this phrase to people who refuse his offer to buy aborted fetuses. Good times.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
A Must See,"I recently watched Goodfellas for the first time and just like The Godfather, I was blown away by how good it was. This is easily going to be one of my all-time favorite movies and I honestly can't think of a single thing wrong with it.As of writing this, I haven't seen many of Martin Scorsese's movies but from what I've heard, he is a legend and this movie proves it without a reasonable doubt. This film is a biopic about a mobster named Henry Hill and his friends Jimmy Conway and Tommy DeVito, played by Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro, and Joe Pesci respectively. It spans 25 years in his life of crime, and what I love about this movie is that unlike other biopics, it follows the same structure of any film that isn't based on a true story. If there's one man that can make this happen, its Scorsese. Much of the film is narrated by Liotta himself and while the dialogue is dirty, it fits the tone of the film perfectly. It also has some narration done by Lorraine Bracco, who plays Henry's wife Karen. This is an interesting choice because it allows us to see the story from the perspectives of more than one character. Every character performance is nothing short of phenomenal. It's also very entertaining which makes it hard to find a good moment to pause on, you'll just want to keep watching till the very end. Every scene is fun to watch and it makes you want to live in their world too and join them in their activities. Another thing I liked was the first act of the film where Henry is a teenager because the actors for the younger versions of Henry and Tommy looked just like Liotta and Pesci. It was so convincing. And just like The Godfather, it portrays Italian Americans in a positive light even though crime is one of the core themes.All in all, Goodfellas really is a Good movie, and definitely one of the greatest of all time and the pinnacle of Scorsese's filmmaking. If you haven't seen this movie, please do because it is one of few films I can describe as ""flawless"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Did Not Disappoint,"I've been recommended this film more times than I can count, so much so that I thought it would be overacted when I finally laid eyes on it.Wrong.It was a really solid film all the way around and definitely didn't feel old or out of style. The narration helped keep the viewer locked in through the time jumps, which could have easily become confusing. The performances didn't blow me away but they all felt like they should be there. They were all a part of what made the world and atmosphere instantly enthralling.After watching Sopranos, it was cool to see the crossover cast members appear here and there. While the show covers around 6 years, GF covers almost 30 and it was so impressive to see it all feel satisfying in the end despite the jumping around.

Or great action? Great dialogues?

Perhaps it really did in the past decades? These are people who steal money, and murder each other mostly over small arguments. They have no grand visions, grand confrontations or dilemmas.

Plot shy but still a decent movie.,"""As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster.""-- Henry Hill, Brooklyn, N.Y. 1955.Starring Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro.Written by Nicholas Pileggi ( Novel) and Martin Scorsese.Directed by Martin Scorsese.First of all I'll say that this isn't normally the kind of movie I watch. In fact I think ( apart from Bugsy Malone which probably really doesn't count) this is the first Mobster movie I can remember watching, It's a proper guys movie. I'm a guy but I'm not that much of a geezer. This is probably to movies what Top Gear is to TV.It's quite long but it did keep my interest all the way. The acting performances are decent without there really being any stand out performances. Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci ( is he really not related in any way to Joe Paquale?) were probably the pick of the bunch amongst this star studded cast of big nosed very Italian looking actors.Robert De Niro didn't really play a big part and for most of the movie it felt like he was just going through the motions and doing a pretty decent impression of himself, if that makes sense.The cinematography was good and there there lots of laughs, shocks, blood and twists along the way which I'd expect from a Scorsese film. The big problem from my point of view is that there isn't much of a plot. It's very artsy but there isn't much of a plot to keep me that interested. And I prefer a plot to grab hold of. That's probably because its a true story and they didn't want to make up too much stuff in case they offended the wrong people. I mean would you want to p*** off the mob?Overall this is a decent movie if you like this kind of thing.

"As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster...","Who would you call a nice guy? Probably a work colleague who, to the detriment of his time, agrees to drink a glass of beer with you and listen to crazy talk about lost love. And after the third glass of beer it becomes clearly clear to you that this is, in general, a nice guy. The heroes of this film will not negotiate with you, will not show understanding, and if you owe something to these people, then death becomes not the worst way out of this situation. This is a film about the life of the mafia .Even when Henry was in school, he saw how simple it all goes to people from the "" family "". They robbed, cheated and even killed people, but their opinions did not change. They were afraid, and therefore - respected. They were not afraid of anyone and they had good reason. Naturally, young Henry was struck by such a life, and in his heart he had long since matured in order to start his own criminal career and, finally, to become a real gangster. And this story is dedicated to his ascent, his victories and his collapse.Despite the fact that the events of the film occur predominantly in the 70s of the last century, this picture makes us recall our nostalgic memories of the unforgettable computer game "" Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven "", where events took place in the 30s. In addition to the general atmosphere in these works of art, some scenes from the film frankly migrated to the screens of computer monitors. Remarkable is the fact that the protagonist of the film - Ray Liotta was subsequently involved in the sound of Tommy Angelo - the main character of the already mentioned game.According to many sites that are directly related to the field of cinema, and some film magazines, "" Glorious guys "" - this is the most realistic film about the mafia ever created. In this aspect, it is difficult for me not to agree with them, when scenes of beatings, which the Godfather trilogy and the painting Once Upon a Time in America often neglected, are often swept across the frame. Martin Scorsese took the story based on real events, reworked it into a script, and created from it not a banal tale about the mafia, but a hard interesting film that is worth watching several times.Henry . The protagonist of the film, through whose eyes we see everything that happens in the film. His character performed by Ray Liotta is laconic and not too emotional. But this does not mean that he is boring. His acting potential is revealed closer to the second half of the film, when Henry's life begins to lose its former stability, and now he has to really survive in order to stay afloat.Jimmy I have already seen so many films with the participation of Robert De Niro that it would seem there is nothing surprising. This actor perfectly showed a variety of images, from comedies to strong dramas. And yet, Robert is surprised. He is fully revealed in the film. His character is a gangster with experience, who has engaged himself in all areas of the criminal life of society. His preference is robbery, however, if necessary, he is capable of anything, including murder.Tommy . The brightest character in this movie. In all likelihood, this is the best role played by Joe Pesci . Here he was given a real revelation, which cannot be said about such paintings as "" Home Alone "" or "" Deadly Weapon "". His character is small, obviously with a chronic neurosis, a gangster, with a complex youthful fate, who is very proud of what he has achieved. He does not allow anyone to insult himself, while he will allow himself clearly more than acceptable, at any convenient occasion grabbing a knife or a gun. It is necessary to mention that this is also a very talkative, and therefore very funny character. Honored Oscar for Best Supporting Role.The director of the film, Martin Scorsese , the author of such masterpiece films like Gangs of New York and the Oscar-winning ""The Departed, "" created a film that perfectly complements Godfather , telling the most tough and interesting story about the life of the mafia. I recommend viewing this film to anyone who likes masterpieces, to all sincere cinema fans, since this is a really interesting film, which doesn't need a half-hour buildup at a time of two and a half hours.

I'd crack under the pressure and would probably wind up getting whacked (I've not a drop of Sicilian blood in me either, so would never be a 'made' man). I'm far safer sat here at my Mac typing film reviews.Real life mobster Henry Hill (portrayed by Ray Liotta), on the other hand, had always wanted to be a 'wiseguy', and lived the dream to the full, making all the right connections and bags of cash in the process, at least until his greed got him into trouble with mob bosses and he was forced to turn state's evidence to save his skin.As directed by Martin Scorsese, this account of Hill's exploits is extremely gripping stuff, with great period detail, a superb soundtrack, and a standout cast (including Robert De Niro, Paul Sorvino and Joe Pesci) all putting in great performances, Pesci in particular giving it all as loose cannon Tommy DeVito, one of the scariest characters ever committed to film (his classic 'funny like a clown?' scene is unbearably tense). The film is also incredibly violent, showing the harsh reality of the 'business' in unflinching detail, opening as it means to go on with the brutal stabbing and shooting of some poor sap in the trunk of a car.Nope a life of crime is definitely not for me.

Classic gangster flick and it shows,"I love the way this film is shot, it looks like a moving Italian painting, and I think the cinematographer did that on purpose, my favourite shot is where Henry's wife was abused and he's walking up to the abuser, there's no dialogue just the sound of his shoes tapping the floor. There are no bad guys in this film the only bad guys are the main characters, and somehow you root for them, that's how you make a good bad guy, you can understand their intentions.And the acting? Oh my god. It feels like the cameraman's a ghost and he's just recording these people's daily life, they're all distinct and natural, even the background actors add to the realism of the world. There's narration throughout the whole film, films use this as a tool to dump exposition but this one uses it to explain the thoughts and feelings of the characters, it also shows how insanely twisted these gangsters are. Even though there isn't a main goal except for Harry wanting to be a gangster, this film manages to be entertaining through and through.It's another classic gangster flick.

Great film,This is a really great film that was amazing on release as it is now 30 years later. Beautifully shot movie with high production values and what a soundtrack through the times it's like a jukebox for all generations. Added to the Stellar acting its one of the greats. Would not be made as good today. A Perfect movie. You don't make them like this anymore that's for sure. Can't say anything more on how powerful and Brilliant it is.

True gangster saga packs a wallop...,"Based on a true story, Martin Scorsese turns GOODFELLAS into an engrossing gangster saga that provides a lot of intense actors with some meaty acting roles--among them, RAY LIOTTA (""I always wanted to be a gangster""), JOE PESCI, ROBERT DeNIRO, LORRAINE BRACCO and PAUL SORVINO.The strong narrative follows the career of a youth, Henry Hill (RAY LIOTTA), an Irish lad living in a neighborhood ruled by the Italian Mafia who wants the easy life of crime and money and fancy cars and life in the fast lane. He enjoys the life of crime until it threatens to jeopardize the security of the life he has as a married man.It's a film very similar in theme to ""The Godfather"", but not quite up to that level of achievement. RAY LIOTTA has never gotten enough credit for his leading role while most of the acting awards went to JOE PESCI as the gun happy hood with an explosive temperament in an Oscar-winning supporting role.If you like this sort of thing, this will be your ticket. Some of the scenes have a strong impact with startling realism as far as the violence goes, and it moves smoothly toward a satisfactory ""crime does not pay"" conclusion.

Goodfellas,"I have been looking at the top 100 movies list of IMDb and it is becoming so disappointing. The top 6 movies are of crime, murder, action and mafia. Casablanca is the only movie that is of its own category standing out alone at 7th place; but this time I at looking at GoodFellas at spot 17 - all time great movies.The story is based on true events and characters from a novel named ""Wise Guy"" written by crime reporter Nicholos Pileggi. It is about this boy Henry Hill born (Ray Liotta) in 1943 in a poor working class family who wanted to be in a gang since his boyhood because that gave him freedom, money, and respect from people. He joins hands with Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) and Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro). This trio starts by hijacking, stealing and selling goods from huge truck loads. Once arrested Hill starts dealing in drugs in prison and when out continues to do so. In the end, with difficult times, of police after him, with new enemies and having difficult times with his wife Karen (Lorriane Bracco)  he decides to be an informant to avoid prison sentence and gives in most of his gangster friends  good fellows! The movie is directed by Martin Scorsese, who like Tarantino has earned his reputation with cold blooded killing of people and mafia movies. He directs the movie well in all departments and combines with ample social, family and drama scenes to balance the dark narrative.All the actors have acted well, but the best in the lot is Joe Pesci who has played the weird cranky character of Tommy with such conviction that it should be remembered just for its sheer portrayal of characteristics. Ray Liotta who gets to play the central character is okay and his career till date shows that he has lost himself into mundane small roles. Robert De Niro is as good as ever and shows his brilliant insight to understanding deep dark characters  he loves to play.The movie progresses from 1950 till 1980s and Martin captures all those eras with much ease and details.Even though his movie is in the top 20 list - lately, seeing many of these mafia movies  I do not feel that much excited. It has become routine and mundane for me to watch the cold killings, glorifying killings, blood everywhere  showing crazy characters who pull out gun at any point to shoot someone. I feel sick at times for the world and the good directors who have not got over showing it on big screen.Just a trivia, Henry Hill is still alive but suffering depression and fighting alcoholism and spends most of his time in rehab centers.(Stars 7 out of 10)",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

I loved everything about this movie,"Goodfellas (1990) is definitely one of my top 3 all time favorite gangster movies and one I recently watched again from my personal collection. The storyline follows a group of friends who work together and quickly work their way up the organized crime ladder. As they grow it quickly becomes hard to identify who can trust who versus who is working for their own personal interest. This confusion can cause problems for business. This movie is directed by Martin Scorsese (Casino) and stars Ray Liotta (Blow), Robert De Niro (Raging Bull), Joe Pesci (Lethal Weapon 2), Paul Sorvino (Nixon) and Lorraine Bracco (The Basketball Diaries). The depth by which this storyline is delivered is absolutely amazing. The details around every character, the nature of the business, the writing and dialogue lead to a rollercoaster of emotions as the film unfolds. You really get wrapped up and rooting interest in the characters. The acting is absolutely phenomenal by every character and the film locations are perfectly selected (I've actually visited a couple). The soundtrack is also very good.

One of the great mob movies,"This film tells the story of Irish/Italian mobster Henry Hill; from the early days when he worked for mobsters as a teenager in the 1950s, through the sixties and seventies to his arrest in the eighties. We see the ease with which he slips into this world; the rewards and dangers it brings. During this time he works with fellow mobsters James Conway and the psychotic Tommy DeVito; he also marries Karen. While Henry isn't a killer he isn't unaware of the violent side of their business.This is often described as the greatest mob movie; I can't say that but only because there are other very well-known mob movies that I have yet to see. The story is gripping from start to finish; there are moments of humour which frequently turn to extreme danger in the blink of an eye; this is usually due to Tommy's hair-trigger temper. The violence is usually sudden and bloody; as a character points out they don't waste time talking before they waste somebody. The cast is brilliant; Joe Pesci stands out as Tommy, it is hardly surprising that he picked up an Oscar. Ray Liotta and Robert De Niro are great as Henry and James; also particularly notable are Lorraine Bracco as Karen Hill and Paul Sorvino as ""Paulie"" Cicero, the mobster Henry works for.

"""Bustin' balls""","The gangster movie has gone through a lot of changes, especially since being reinvented as high drama with The Godfather pictures in the 1970s. Such classics soon become clichés and in the 80s gangster movies were often spoofs (Prizzi's Honor, Married to the Mob). Goodfellas opened a new chapter of serious yet very stylish crime flicks.Goodfellas was, back then, a comparative rarity in the genre in that it is based on a true story. And storywise it is as a much a documentary as it is a good yarn. Most scenes, when considered individually are simply revelations of gangster life, and the almost constant narration more or less acknowledges this. It's only when viewed as a whole that an entire story arc starts to emerge. But there is also continual structure in the arrangement of each little anecdote. Take for example the pair of scenes in the bar with ""Spider"". These go together, but you need to know that some time has passed in between them. Writers Nicholas Pilleggi and Martin Scorsese throw in a quick in-between-scene of Ray Liotta and Lorraine Bracco arguing. This demonstrates that other events have gone on in the meantime, but also keeps the tense, gritty atmosphere riding along. The vibrant language and frequent diversions into wisecracking make this a forerunner to the dialogue-for-the-sake-of-dialogue school of screen writing which Quentin Tarantino would soon specialise in.Martin Scorsese's direction closely follows the narration, both in its content and its snappy pace. Like Hitchcock his camera is constantly roving around, leading us by the hand and making us look at things. In effect he's illustrating Henry Hill's words. And often he's showing a little more than that. Sometimes there's a cheeky counterpoint between words and images. There are also some clever pull-back-and-reveal shots. In one early shot we see a close-up of some liquor changing hands. The camera pulls out to show that the booze is being used to bribe a couple of cops. We are continually bombarded with ideas, continually pushed and pulled through the narrative. Of course, a lot of Scorsese's technical business here – the zooms, jump cuts and lengthy tracking shots are just cinematic wheelies, and headache-inducing ones at that. But so long as you can put up with them you have to admire the rhythmic precision with which the whole thing has been put together.There is however another downside to the overtly technical style at work here. We don't really get to see the performances at their best. Poor old Ray Liotta probably did the best work of his life here, but it's all chopped up in little bits, and all we get is occasional looks, flashes, half-gestures. The same goes for Lorraine Bracco. Robert De Niro apparently did extensive research into his character, but there doesn't seem to have been much point since he is more or less the same as all the other Italian American gangsters he has played in his career. The only player who really comes out well here is Joe Pesci. Pesci has such charisma and presence that he commands attention even in small doses. It also helps that his style is very much in tune with the punchy dialogue and staccato rhythm of the whole piece.Coming from the peak in Scorsese's abilities as a director of tight control over every aspect, Goodfellas could easily have fallen into the trap of being nothing but a showy technical exercise. The only thing that saves it is the fact that its subject matter is so interesting. Old and established as the gangster movie is, this one reveals so many sordid truths and fascinating facts about that lifestyle, and does so in such a direct, never-a-dull-moment manner, that it gives the whole genre a jolting jump-start.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
how can a masterpiece be underrated? here's how...,"Goodfellas is one of the top movies in the history of cinema, nominated for best picture (and five other Oscars) considered by many the top movie of the 90s, so how can it be underrated.put simply, it is underrated because the Godfather (parts I and II) are so brilliant. The sad thing is that, because Goodfellas is a gangster movie, it will always be compared to other gangster movies. for some reason, movies in that genre (gangster/organized crime) are never looked at as individual pictures, but are forever compared and put up against other gangster films. The only exception to this rule, is the godfather of all gangster movies, the Godfather. this is probably because it is the first of its kind (not the first gangster movie, but the first modern-style gangster movie), most gangster movies made after the Godfather are complete rip offs of the Godfather, but every once in a while a movie like Goodfellas comes along that may be similar to on the surface, but is then written off by many. when I say, written off, I mean that it is not getting the credit it deserves. it is a masterpiece, yes it is a gangster picture, no it is not the Godfather. Many people admire it for what it is, but if the Godfather hadn't been made, or even if this film wasn't always compared to it, it would take its deserved place in cinema history. that place is not as a good film, and a great gangster film, it is a artful, entertaining, and near flawless film, and one of the top two greatest gangster films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

One of the best Mob movies ever,"One of the best Mob movies ever. Robert De Niro can always look dangerous. Ray Liotta, as always, looks like a total weasel. Good casting. Lorraine Bracco was great here, as was Paul Sorvino. But the real performance came from Joe Pesci, as the Academy recognized. I first saw him as the buffoon in the ""Lethal Weapon"" movies. Here, his unstable dangerousness (it's a word, look it up) oozes menace right off the screen. This film is very different from the Godfather films in that these characters are blue collar hoods, rather than top bosses. To me this brought home even more the evil, law of the jungle, credo of the mob. Very powerful stuff.NOTE: I have the DVD, and the sound on it is not so good.

A definitive gangster film,"Goodfellas is a pretty mesmerizing film. Martin Scorsese at his best is an incredibly dynamic director and Goodfellas is most certainly one of his greatest achievements. For a film that clocks in at two and a half hours it sure moves at a fast pace. This is a movie that never lags. There is no waste. It's a master-class in how to keep an audience glued to a screen.It documents the story of Henry Hill the real life gangster. Like the 30's gangster films it's a rise and fall epic, but unlike these the resolution is a lot more ambiguous and the overall presentation is considerably more complex. I'm not sure how close the film is to actual events, but I do realize that some principal characters have had their names changed for some reason. Ultimately, the level of actual authenticity doesn't matter very much as this is a superlative film either way.Scorsese has never been afraid to go to extremes. This film like many of his others is very raw. Language and violence are strong; the latter, very much so in the murder of the character Billy Batts. The brutality adds an undeniable visceral appeal to the film. Yet it does still seem entirely justifiable within the context of the story. Acting is universally top drawer with everybody giving terrific performances. Although special mention does have to go to Joe Pesci whose character Tommy is seriously unforgettable. Tommy is a pint-sized sociopath with a pretty monumental chip on his shoulder. Most film-makers would never have recognized that an actor as small as Pesci would be ideal for the role of this character. But Pesci's size and high-pitched voice only add to his menace somehow, it's as if these defects of his character make Tommy even more at war with the world and make him an even more bitter and dangerous guy. Scorsese's trademark use of popular music is excellently incorporated into the film. The tunes by turns indicate the time period, parallel the events and add an ironic backdrop to proceedings. It's a textbook example of how to compose a soundtrack with contemporary music but in a way that adds depth and meaning.In a nutshell, Goodfellas is arguably the best gangster film out there. As a piece of cinema, it is thrilling. Recommended unreservedly.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
A timeless masterpiece.,"GoodFellas, directed by Martin Scorsese in 1990, is a true masterpiece of American cinema. This film is not only a gripping crime drama but also a deeply insightful and richly textured portrayal of the American mob culture.The movie is based on the real-life story of Henry Hill, played by Ray Liotta, a young man who aspired to become a member of the powerful New York mafia family. The film takes us on a journey through Henry's rise and eventual fall as a member of the mafia, showcasing his relationships with fellow gangsters Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci).What makes GoodFellas truly exceptional is its flawless execution. From the casting to the cinematography, every element of the film is expertly crafted. The performances by the actors are stunning, particularly Pesci's explosive and terrifying portrayal of Tommy. Scorsese's direction is masterful, keeping the pace brisk and the tension high throughout the entire film. The use of voiceover narration, music, and editing are all spot-on, creating a richly immersive experience for the viewer.One of the greatest strengths of GoodFellas is its attention to detail. The film is meticulously researched and accurately depicts the world of organized crime in New York City during the 1960s and 1970s. The script, written by Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi, is both informative and entertaining, weaving together complex characters and storylines in a way that is easy to follow and deeply engaging.Overall, GoodFellas is a true classic of American cinema. It is a film that stands the test of time and continues to captivate audiences today. If you have not seen this film, I highly recommend that you do so immediately. It is an absolute must-see for any movie lover and a testament to the power of great filmmaking.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
A Disappointment,"I did not see ' Goodfellas ' back in the 1990's and a day after seeing the great ' The Departed ' I was to be honest bored by it. I felt I had seen it all before in other films, and its being based on a true story and having actors to play real people did not give me a bonus interest. Why ? For me I think it depends on the acting, and the pace of the film. ' Goodfellas ' has a similar opening as ' The Departed ' with a kid on the block being introduced to mob crime, and pursuing that way of life. Similar too that at the opening we witness a brutal killing, this time of a brutalised man in the boot of a car. Maybe I should have watched ' Goodfellas ' first, but I feel that I would have considered ' The Departed ' the better film. For a start I feel a film is as good as its actors and their energy, and other than the late Ray Liotta I was not charged up by the other performances. The off the cuff dialogue seemed tedious, and the four letter words seemed frankly lazy. I read that Scorsese let the cast use ' natural ' dialogue and edited the best, and I found most of it just covering empty time. But Liotta shines as the kid grown up, and it is from his perspective and that of his wife who are in the forefront and narrate the film. Robert de Niro was a disappointment, but at least he bothered to have ageing makeup. The film covers from the 1950's to a couple of decades later. Maybe trivial, but laziness in filming important detail can lead to disbelief, and Liotta remained as young as when he started. I could also have done with less songs of the times on the soundtrack. And unlike ' The Departed ' I did not find outstanding set pieces. I am willing to believe it is one of the greatest films but not for me. I longed for DiCaprio and Damon to explode on the screen and to be completely honest I was bored by most of the acting. One last dislikeable detail was the killing of a black man for no apparent reason that I could account for. A very ugly short scene committed while the killers made a cup of coffee. It left a sour taste in the mouth and maybe then I switched off interest in the characters.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

"""You insulted him a little bit""","Martin Scorsese's 'Goodfellas' (1990) is an iconic gangster/mobster movie about the real-life story of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), his life in the mob and his relationship with his mob partners Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) in the Italian-American crime syndicate.It is genuinely a great feeling when you get the opportunity to review an all-time great film such as 'Goodfellas'!
This is the one pure gangster movie that everybody keeps talking about (I don't consider 'The Godfather' a ""pure"" gangster movie)!I am someone whose number one favorite director of all time is Martin Scorsese and I therefore love a lot of his movies! While 'Goodfellas' is not my favorite film of his, it is certainly Scorsese's most iconic and beloved piece! For heaven's sake, this film is one of the top 20 highest rated films! There are so many good reasons why the film deserves this great amount of praise!Let me now explain why this film is so great! First and foremost, the acting performances as well as the chemistry between all the actors are both completely on point!The protagonist in this film is Ray Liotta's character Henry Hill who also does the voice-over explaining the whole process of becoming and being a gangster. Liotta plays a bit of a socially awkward character who has some weird tendencies, yet he fits in well with his gangster group.Of course we also have to talk about Robert De Niro, the acting genius! De Niro is an absolute titan in the film industry. He paved the way for so many young actors who looked up to him thanks to his incredible performances over the many decades! De Niro's most iconic role might just be the one of James Conway in this movie! I don't know how De Niro does it, but he can make anything look cool. There is one iconic scene of him just smoking a cigarette for about 20-30 seconds. That scene alone is one of the greatest scenes in film history! De Niro has always had the incredible ability to stir up the whole scene and be an absolute scene-stealer! Many of these mob movies require actors that bring a lot of charisma with them. Robert De Niro is definitely one of those actors who can fool the audience, making them think that he might not be so bad after all due to his undeniable charm and charisma!When you talk about gangster movies, names like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci usually come up very frequently. Speaking of Joe Pesci, he arguably delivers a career best performance in this film!
Pesci plays Tommy DeVito, a really funny, yet extremely scary gangster who, if you annoy him a little bit (""break his balls a bit""), might end up killing you on the spot. He is THAT crazy! Joe Pesci plays this gangster with such brilliance and precision! It seems effortless the way he just talks and acts. It's like he is a real-life gangster himself! That's how convincing Joe Pesci plays Tommy DeVito! I also find it pretty amazing that I picture an Italian gangster to be someone like Joe Pesci's Tommy DeVito. The way he talks, acts and the things he says.Moving on, let's talk about the genius mastermind that we can all thank for making this film, Martin Scorsese!
Scorsese wrote the screenplay for 'Goodfellas' alongside Nicholas Pileggi. Scorsese obviously also directed the film. Let me get down to the nitty-gritty. This motion picture has some outstanding cinematography! There is one scene when you can see characters walking inside a restaurant through the back and the camera always staying behind them as they move from one room into the next. The way it was shot blew me totally away!The film also has really fitting musical choices with lyrics that can partly tell the story without any voice-overs needed. Now THAT is not something you experience in a lot of movies out there.As if I haven't given the film enough praise already, I need to commend the editing department for doing such a fantastic job with the pacing of the film as well as the great transitions between the scenes!On top of that I definitely appreciate that this is not a predictable film. Furthermore it is a very rewatchable film because, despite being over 3 decades old, it still manages to stay so relevant, fresh, timeless and unique, all at the same time!Before I wrap up this review of mine, I most certainly need to compare this film with Scorsese's other mobster movies! In my opinion 'Goodfellas' is better than 'Mean Streets' (1973) and 'The Departed' (2006) while not being quite as great as 'The Irishman' (2019) and 'Casino' (1995) in my opinion!I only really have two minor criticisms. Firstly the film is more interesting to me when it was about the gangsters interacting with each other. The scenes that were about Henry Hill's family and that whole side story was definitely good, but it was just not on the same level.
Finally this movie wraps up a little too quickly for my taste. I thought the ending was a bit too abrupt. Like I said I only have ""minor"" criticisms!Overall, Martin Scorsese's 'Goodfellas' is one of the best motion pictures ever made! This is an absolute must-see for anyone out there who, for some reason, hasn't seen it yet! 'Goodfellas' has been hugely influential in pop culture and it is still constantly referred to by many people, especially comedians! Martin Scorsese, Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. Beautiful! 8/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Goodfellas - A Superior Crime Film,"Goodfellas has a trio of fine actors in the lead role. That alone makes it one of the best gangster films ever produced. But it was the writing of Martin Scorcese, who unfairly is abundantly talented with both directing and writing skills. He makes these characters come to life with his superb dialog and story line.Robert DiNero and Joe Pesci lead the way here, as Ray Liotta is a bit softer compared to those two actors. Great supporting roles included a very convincing Paul Sorvino and Lorraine Bracco. Pesci is a piece of work in this supporting role (he won the Oscar for it). His dialogue is priceless; as in, ""You think I'm funny?"", which now has become the most famous line in the film. Be sure to catch these bad boys for another viewing.PS. According to IMDB Pulp FIction and Fight Club are superior films to this one. LOL.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Definitely up there with the best of all time,"The first title that will come to most people's mind when thinking of mafia films is inevitably 'The Godfather' - a timeless classic that many consider to be the greatest movie of all time. However, as good as 'The Godfather' is, there's something about 'Goodfellas' that I enjoy more.Maybe it's the way the story is told, or the fact that the violence in 'Goodfellas' is a lot more ruthless and brutal. It also has more entertainment value compared to the plot-heavy Godfather. Whatever the reason, 'Goodfellas' is a film I enjoy immensely and is up there as one of my favourites in the crime genre.Aside from the story, 'Goodfellas' is a near perfect piece of filmmaking, with a witty and intelligent script, brilliant acting throughout, and terrific cinematography.

A Masterpiece Called GoodFellas,"Goodfellas is awesome. I will not say it's Scorsese's best, I think The Departed is kinda better, but I really love that too. Henry Hill is an awesome character, even though he is a villain. I actually really like the ending of this film, although it is not even one of the best scenes in the film. Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, even Samuel L. Jackson is in this masterpiece! Watch it, you'll have fun watching it 2 hours and 30 minutes and you'll never get bored. N E V E R. You could watch it 10 Million times and still having fun! The weird thing is that is a comedy.

Outstanding adaptation,"As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster."" Martin Scorsese's woozy, dizzy adaptation of Nicholas Pileggi's slice-of-Mafia-life book Wiseguy is many things: a social anthropology study, an epic look at the American Dream, a coked-up nightmare, a nostalgic look back at an age when made men were made men, a head-spinning display of virtuosic filmmaking, the blueprint for the modern organized-crime saga and a peerless look at a world where you might be slapped on the back or shot in the face. ""Mob guys love it, because it's the real thing,"" Pileggi told GQ. ""They say, 'It's like a home movie.'"" And as you watch Ray Liotta's Henry Hill go from up-and-coming crook to cosa nostra bigwig to Witness-Protection-Plan ""average nobody,"" you realize you're getting a funhouse-mirror reflection of an old-fashioned U.

"I love Scorsese, but hated 'Goodfellas'.","I was first introduced to Scorsese's work with 'Taxi Driver', and was immediately compelled to rush out and rent 'Mean Streets' and then Scorsese's first, 'Who's that Knockin'?' Although these films were both uneven in places, I still saw the same brilliance. So of course I had to rent 'Goodfellas', right? It is in everyone's top 100. And I was monumentally disappointed. There was no struggle with moral issues. These guys were just violent jerks for whom I had no sympathy. I *wanted* them to get caught so someone would get them off of the street (and off of my TV screen). Ray Liotta is such a pretty boy that he could never match DeNiro or Keitel in my book. And the violence in this movie was just sickening and unnecessary. Sorry, folks, disagree with me all you want, but I'm sorry I ever decided to watch 'Goodfellas' and I haven't felt compelled to pick up a Scorsese flick since.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

A good movie about some bad guys,"Goodfellas is just one of those movies. It has everything from great directing and acting to awesome music and memorable comic moments.

Throughout the movie you get the classic comedy that comes along with Joe Pesci and Robert Deniro and some great music to go along with all these great scenes. A lot of people claim that the godfather is the greatest movie of all time. To me, watching Goodfellas is just as engrossing but more fun to watch thanks to Pesci, Deniro and Liotta.

Most grossly overrated movie ever,"By one of the most overrated directors ever. Mindless, incoherent, unceasing violence. Narration is almost always a bad idea in a movie and this movie is no exception. A little narration can be okay but when it is such a dominant part of a movie, it subtracts and doesn't add. But, more importantly, about half way through, I was sickened by all the violence AND depravity that I just couldn't stomach any more and basically ""skimmed"" (fast forwarding about 5 minutes to watch 30 seconds, repeatedly) to the end just trying to see something redeemable that would validate all the unwarranted hullabaloo that was given this piece of crap.The shame is that Scorcese has the ability to make great movies that include violence and violent personalities (Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull) but these are exceptions which everyone seems to remember and not the stinkers like The Color of Money, The Last Temptation of Christ or Goodfellas.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
A very good movie but a few major flaws.,"When I saw ""Goodfellas"" I knew everything that was going to happen because it was based on a book called ""Wise Guys"" that I had read a few years before. Though I knew what was coming I was pleased with the acting, at it's best. The character were developed and depicted in a way that I though made them almost like heros. Some, like Pesci's , were amusing and sometimes funny. Conway was presented in a truer light, and I think that only an actor of DeNiro's caliber was capable of showing James Conway as the truly mean and vicious person he was in life. Henry Hill and his wife Karen are presented almost as victims and one could almost feel sorry for them. It's hard not to like Lorraine Bracco in any role she plays and I wish that they had cast someone not as likable as her as Mrs Hill. I, being involved in law enforcement for nearly twenty-five years saw them as criminals. The scenes depicted in the jails was as true to life as possible. I just feel that the way the criminals are made into heroes is a bad message to present to young people. More of the needless murder and suffering, the survivors family and loved ones left to pick up the pieces are neglected and ignored. Henry committing felonies on a daily basis, Karen living a glamorous life, and when they finally get caught and ready to be sent to jail, where they belong, become outstanding citizens by informing on their friends. Hill and his wife are no better than any of the others that committed felonies, condoned and participated in murder, robbery, assault, drug dealing and extortion. The flaw is that these characters are made to be sympathetic victims. It wasn't poor Henry's fault that for as long as he could remember he wanted to be a criminal. It wasn't Karen's fault that she felt all the glamour surrounding a life of extortion and theft. Her mother, presented as a mean interfering woman was another victim as was her father, presented as sickly and spineless. They truly suffered, seeing their daughter getting involved in a life with such trash. A message sent to young people that this type of life is fun, great and carefree is not a good message. Lets face it, Hill continues to be a criminal, even if not on the same scale he still goes into stores and steals from the shelf and we, the general public,  have to make up for the vendors lose because of this. Let's present the characters for what they are. Poor Tommy being murdered because he resented being shot by a mean coward. A man trying to make a living running a nightclub having his business being stolen or a poor mailman making his daily round sand being assaulted for doing what he was suppose to do, deliver the mail to the addressee and so many more depicted in the movie not as victims but as an occasional ship passing in the night and happening to be passing a barge filled with garbage. The movie is entertaining, but lets not forget that in real life these characters left a trail of victims and so much unnecessary hurt.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Masterful Manipulation,"It is a great Movie that can have you believing what you saw was not what you saw. It is the genius of Advertising and The Con. Contrary to popular belief this is not a glamorization of The Mob or their lifestyle, in fact, it is just the opposite. No matter how much the narrator/main Character tells us how attractive it is and how desirable it is to be a Wiseguy, the Film denies this in almost every scene.It is the rhythm, the staccato of it all that hypnotizes us into believing what he is saying, but not what is actually occurring. The pulsating Music Soundtrack and the uncanny mesmerizing voice over lulls the Audience into a false sense of a wanting place. It is the work of the Devil. Or at least a devilishly good Film-Maker.There is nothing attractive here. The People are ugly and unpleasant and constantly do ugly and unpleasant things. The Sets are mundane, gaudy and unattractive, as are the clothes. There is not one appealing aspect to any of this Photo-Play. Yet, Audiences are led by this pied piper Scorsese into the rat-a-tat-tat ruminations of a heel and a turncoat and they actually care about this crumb.Such is the magical work of a Movie Maker obsessed with style that cannot be denied His Craft.

The only intrigue is the hope for something worthwhile to happen...,"Quite solid for a biography, but it certainly lacks the connection to the main character. So much so, there are some parts that is not told from the protagonist's perspective, but instead exposed by other characters. The same thing applies to narrating from someone else's perspective. Albeit typical for this type of movie, the narration is monotone, plain and explains trivial things that did not need narration - almost as an after-thought. As if what was shown on screen was not enough, and they wanted to make sure they had convinced the audience that the gangsters were rich and powerful...The protagonist is difficult to connect with, as some actions are not shown until after the fact, and the lack of expressed emotions, thoughts and motives, makes him difficult to find likeable. The acting overall is quite bad, especially at the times where acting were vital.Although some story was told here, it was not really compelling. A lot of names were thrown around, money-bundles were exchanged and bullets went flying, but overall it felt unnecessary. Sure, the fact that the characters were untouchable was already obvious without the reoccurring narrator, but that also ruins any potential suspense and thus, the entire movie is a breeze - regardless of what happens, the character is unmoved and it perfectly fits with the flat acting.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Its influence is incalcuable - you don't get a million moving-camera showstoppers without that Copacabana tour, and you definitely don't get the Tarantino, et al., mix of black humor and horrifying violence without Goodfellas' getting that combination down to a science first. And though Scorsese had made great movies before and would make great ones after this, this Mob-flick hit feels like a summation of his culturally specific, universally thrilling cinema about men on the edge.

The violence, the cutthroat nature of the lives of these mobsters isn't watered down, if there ever was an anti gang film this may well be it. Ray liotta gives the performance of his career, a height he was never able to hit again and possibly should have earned him an Oscar. De Niro once again proves his craft as the sociopathic Jimmy, teaming up with director Martin Scorcese for a fifth time. Pesci undoubtedly steals the show as the blisteringly violent mobster Tommy De Vito.

Trash.  Utter trash.,"Goodfellas makes a strong case for itself as the most overrated movie of the 80s or any decade. Never in my life have I encountered a film less deserving of its critical and popular accolades. After watching it for the second time recently (to make sure my impression from a viewing years earlier was accurate), I feel every person involved in the picture, and particularly Martin Scorsese, deserves to be punished severely for inflicting Goodfellas upon me.Goodfellas has absolutely nothing to offer. It has neither the wisdom nor the compassion to say or reveal anything about life or human beings. Anyway, Goodfellas is not interested in that. It just wants to be smart, hip, and funny. With such lofty goals, it's a wonder this entire star-studded cast of actors and filmmakers fell so very, very short.Goodfellas is not smart. It is not intelligent enough to understand what it think it portrays on an individual or larger basis. It does not somehow explain or explore the mob psyche, the existence of organized crime in America, or anything else for that matter. Despite the fact that it is taken from actual events and people, it seems to desire no contact with reality.Goodfellas is not hip. Apparently Martin Scorsese was not aware that there is nothing less cool than trying hard to be cool. Goodfellas is full of flashy camera moves, tough looking guys in swank suits, and more fast, colloquial dialogue than you could beat out of Dashiell Hammett, but none of it adds up to anything but slime. Yes, that's right: slime. Goodfellas is so obnoxious you want to take a magical eraser and scrub each of its characters back into the pure white on the page from which they sprang. Is this an honorable aim for a film? To make you hate its characters, to make you hate its voice? Let me be the one to say that cynicism is generally a good cover for laziness, and as an approach to life it is one step above nihilism. Real cynicism has no place in art.Goodfellas is not funny. A complete lack of respect for human life is not a secret recipe for brilliant ironic comedy. It is disgusting, really, and those who laugh reserve a spot for themselves in the grime between the cracks under the bottom of the barrel of good humor.The performances in Goodfellas, much lauded, are ridiculously one-sided. How wonderful they managed to span the chasm between looking tough and looking smug - all except for Ray Liotta who has to do the balancing act between being paranoid and annoyed. Bravo.Of note is Scorsese's choice to play pop music over 95 percent of the film, presumably so that we have something to listen to while we are busy ignoring his movie.Goodfellas is trash. Utter trash. The only thing I took out of it is that it is unwise to let a gangster stand behind you.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Titan of gangster movies.,"A decent movie from Scorsese. Contains a rich storytelling with a large amount of details, revealing the characters and moving the plot forward. Actors played well especially Joe Pesci and De Niro of course. The film shot so smoothly and seamlessly so you don't even think about a technical aspect of the movie, because its perfect. All your attent is magnetised to the story, and it is beautiful, touching and not lacking a suspense through the full length of the movie. Definitely deserved it's place among the top movies about gangsters life.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

the best mob movie.....ever!!,"In my mind this is the second best movie ever made after One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest. Most people would argue that the Godfather 1 and 2 are the better mob movies. I must admit that the afformentioned movies are also brilliant and deserve to be in the top ten. I think the things that sways me towards Goodfellas are number 1, the dark sense of humour this movie imbues. The tone of the Godfather's can be much too serious at times. Just because it,s a serious drama doesn,t mean thers's no room for a little levity at times. This movie moves along quite nicely,while the Godfather gets a little bogged down at times....especially the wedding scene which in my mind was about ten minutes too long. Both movies had brilliant direction and performances....i guess i'll call that one a draw. If you like this one check out Casino. It's not as good as Goodfellas or the Godfather's but still very deserving of a viewing. Other mob recomendations are Miller,s Crossing, the Untouchables, Once Upon a Time in America, Scar Face and the Godfather Part 3, yes i just said that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
To say at where I was surprised in this movie.,"If the actor who appeared was DiCaprio or Brad Pitt, I would have thought this would be a Tarantino movie.
I thought that the composition of the story of this movie and the atmosphere of the movie was very similar to Once Upon A Time in Hollywood.
Especially the first half hour. The camera moved very well, and it was difficult for the audience to get bored at the same time. The shooting is very admirable. Each picture is very beautiful. It was beautiful because it was a film. There is characteristic music everywhere. How to use how music is very wonderful. Inundation of music.
The camerawork, photography and music symphony attracted us. If you look at the other films of this director, the scripts are always never a masterpiece. We screenwriters shouldn't try to learn scripts from this director. However. Though, the minimum elements that do not get the customer bored are included in the script.
Overall of those is very similar to Tarantino's Once Upon A Time in Hollywood. I was surprised that the great movie had such a good example. And I think that the director's true greatness is to discover a new atmosphere like this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

A crime movie in the form of a documentary,"Martin Scorsese (director) always loves details in crime films, but he is not primarily interested in the crime itself.

Somewhat other details are visible on the scene mostlyThe film talks about liberation, stereotypes, and entering a new world for humanity. It was Ray Liotta (Henry). He wanted, as I said, to break free from stereotypes and enter the world of gangs.Martin Scorsese (the director) filmed this unfamiliar life and directed it in the form of a film similar to documentaries because he filmed it as if it were a real, realistic life.

The violence which we saw although harsh was artistic and thus a bit detached from reality. In fact we found the style of the film rather too artistic and atmospheric and after a 40 minutes we looked at each other and agreed we were bored by it.

Don't be so dogmatic!,"I've seen this film many times over and it never fails to amaze me how people can criticize Ray Liotta's performance. Liotta's character is pivotal to the overall plot. Because he does not live up to a stereotype of a gangster, people deem his performance as flat and uninteresting. Remember, Liotta's character says ""I always wanted to be a gangster"" not ""I was born to be a gangster"". Over the course of the film, you can see Liotta's character slowly dislike the life he wanted to be so much apart of. The fact that Liotta's character is only half Italian only highlights this point. Other scenes like when Henry sees Jimmy and Tommy after the death of Stacks and when all three are at Tommy's Mother's House further show Henry's remorse for his life decisions. And at the very end of the film when he's commenting on how he missed the old times, he seems to be happy. As the Sid Vicious music starts and we see Henry going back into his house, he does so with a smile, even when he slams the door and we here the slam of the ""cell doors"". Henry is content with the life he has, even if it means he has to remain anonymous for the rest of his life. Liotta's performance as Henry Hill is one of the most subtle and restrained performances I've seen in recent memory. Its a pity that people have to listen to the comments of critics to form their own opinions. People should see the movie and form their own opinions first before running to the newspaper stand and reading the what the critics say. Let's be a little bit more independent in our thought and less dogmatic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

The consistently fine acting by the large cast, the cinematography, editing, dialogue, brilliant use of music, it's all breathtaking. But Scorsese and co-writer Mitch Pileggi never lose lose sight of their main goal - to tell a story. And in that it's really hard to beat this movie. As to the actors De Niro is on top form, Ray Liotta is amazing, and this is Joe Pesci's definitive performance.

Goodfellas: An Unforgettable Masterpiece of Mob Cinema,"Goodfellas, directed by Martin Scorsese, is an unparalleled masterpiece that etches its place in cinematic history as one of the greatest gangster films ever made. Released in 1990, this crime drama weaves a gripping narrative around the rise and fall of Henry Hill, played flawlessly by Ray Liotta, and his tumultuous journey through the world of organized crime.The film's strength lies in its ability to transport the audience into the gritty underworld of the mob. Scorsese's impeccable direction, combined with a brilliant screenplay by Nicholas Pileggi (adapted from his book ""Wiseguy""), creates an authentic and immersive experience. From the opening scene to the final frame, Goodfellas grips you tightly and refuses to let go.The performances in Goodfellas are nothing short of extraordinary. Ray Liotta delivers a career-defining performance as Henry Hill, capturing the character's charisma, ambition, and eventual descent into paranoia. His portrayal is complemented by an exceptional ensemble cast that includes Robert De Niro as the calculating Jimmy Conway, Joe Pesci as the volatile and unpredictable Tommy DeVito, and Lorraine Bracco as Henry's wife, Karen Hill. Each actor brings depth and intensity to their roles, making the characters feel alive and deeply human.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Left me wanting more,"The movie started off with great cinematography but at the halfway mark everything merged together and nothing was striking anymore. The movie had no substance. Nothing stood out about any of the characters, they all were just generically portrayed gangsters. The narration almost got in the way of interpreting the movie on my own terms, it felt like i was being spoon fed the story and not to mention the narration was stale and made the movie seem boring. After watching it im conflicted about what to take from it since it skimmed over everything, the heist that was supposed to be the focal point, turned out to be something that was almost forgettable until i realised that it actually happened in real life which made the movie all the more interesting knowing that these were true events but the movie played no part in portraying the severity. The movie was keen on glamourising the gangster lifestyle but failed to actually show it! All you get is the narration. In my opinion there's only so much you can do w a gangster movie but this was just plain textbook i mean you get the cool and clever lead and when stuff gets too real he's fallen under drug abuse, and although that might've been the reality, this is media portrayal which mainly for entertainment purposes so adding to the character development might have been the right move. The movie showcased the 50's till the 80's without any attention to detail, the music, the wardrobe, the cars etc it all seemed as if they didn't care much about it and the only thing that was important was the well-known cast and the runtime.

Goodfellas,"What's this film called? Asked my mum as we watched this on VHS back in 1991. Goodfellas I yelled. What? Goodfellas!There's nothing good about this fellas she replied. You should have seen her face when De Niro and Liotta started sobbing when Pesci's character is murdered. She was absolutely appalled by their reaction given all the people he had killed.If Godfather III was operatic grandeur. Goodfellas was grimy bluesy dirty rock music back in 1990. This was another movie that was better than the eventual Best Picture winner Dances with Wolves.The Academy could still not overlook that Scorsese made violent movies. No wonder three years later he would make the literary adaptation of The Age of Innocence. It got a U certificate.Joe Pesci won the movie's sole Oscar. Ray Liotta was not even nominated for his dynamite performance. It was the pinnacle role in his career.Once again director Martin Scorsese shows his dazzling technical filmmaking skills. The opening night time scene bathed in red light. Carried over from Mean Streets and Taxi Driver. Itself inspired by Powell/Pressburger The Red Shoes.Goodfellas charts the rise of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta.) Half Italian and half Irish who always wanted to be a gangster from a young age. These guys were respected. Much better than having a crummy 9 to 5 job.Henry starts off parking cars in the cab stand run by local crime boss Paul Cicero (Paul Sorvino) in the 1950s. By the time he is 21 in the 1960s. Harry has worked his way up although not a full member of the mafia as he was not a full blooded Italian.With another half Italian and half Irish Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and the volatile full blooded Italian thug Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci.) They are involved in heists, racketeering and murder. Later some drug dealing without Cicero's knowledge or approval.They live the life of gangster celebrities as they flash their cash. Henry marries a Jewish girl from Long island Karen (Lorraine Bracco) who likes the lifestyle although some of the wives of gangsters repulse her.Scorsese introduces humour when the mobsters and their wives are introduced. They are all called Paul or Peter, the women are all named Maria.However by the early 1980s Henry's life is in disarray. He is a drug addict with several mistresses. Jimmy is paranoid killing any loose ends after major heist at the airport and the police are on their tail.Despite a violent beginning. Scorsese ramps up the violence slowly, there are sudden bursts here and there. You see Tommy lashing out erratically but it gets darker the longer the film goes on.Camaraderie and friendship gives way for every man for themselves attitude. Henry mentions in his narration how you could end up getting killed just over something minor. This is the life of the lower ranked mobsters. You are only protected if you are are a made man.Scorsese is not engaged in morality although he does not glamourise them. By the end their lives are in disarray. You are not meant to root for these people in the way you would for Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) in The Godfather.The real Henry Hill would still do it all again.

An Inside Look,"Goodfellas is a wiseguy movie with them doing wiseguy things. You know: robbing and stealing. Beatings and wackings. Extorting and racketeering. Cussing and swearing. I don't want to minimize the movie to just that but that was the gist of it all.The movie is told from the view of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), a gangster that loved mob life and all it had to offer. Henry Hill is essentially doing a tell all about being a mobster and how mobs operate.What I found most interesting about the movie my second time watching was how sanctimonious mobsters are. Almost like because they have rules that govern their illicit behavior they're better than other criminals. Sure, they'll rob, steal, kill and other crimes but their criminality is not like the criminality of others; almost like there is a nobility to their criminality. The reverence to that lifestyle and the Italian mafioso culture in general could be heard and felt throughout the movie. Henry Hill absolutely loved being a mobster. When I was younger I was fascinated by the lore of it as well (albeit from a great distance, as in from an audience watching on movies) but now I see them as criminals like anyone else. Granted, they are more successful at it than most and they have done very well with their PR but they are still criminals.Goodfellas actually made me see that as Henry narrated about the beatings and killings of criminal and innocent people. Henry was wrapped into all kinds of lowlife activity. His two pals James Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy Devito (Joe Pesci) were savages that would murder anyone in their way. And Tommy would murder just because--he had to be the worst mafia representative ever. So, Goodfellas, if anything, was good for drawing back the curtain on how the seedy world of Italian mobs worked.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Jon Monsarrat review:  too arty & violent,"I admit it; I'm an action movie guy. So a film about the mafia should be right up my alley. But I'm often turned off by dramas. It's not that I don't respect those who like fine art. I do. But personally, I lack the sophistication or training to appreciate the makeup or sets or choreography if the plot is awful and the characters unlikeable.That's what gets in my way when I watch Goodfellas, which I've seen twice now but couldn't get through it the 2nd time. The protagonists are nasty and I couldn't identify with them. This is the same thing that turned me off watching ""Pulp Fiction"".Superb acting, story, some real drama -- but how ugly and why would I want to watch this?Who should see this film:-- art types / drama lovers: a must-see-- action movie types who don't mind when the protagonist is violent and awfulSorry, but at least I've stated some real reasons for giving Goodfellas only a 4 out of 10.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

One of Scorsese's best films that is too good for its own subject matter,"The life and times of Henry Hill and his mob association.'Goodfellas' is Martin Scorsese's classic adaptation of Nicholas Pileggi's book that combines brilliant visuals, memorable dialogue and great performances.I think the subject is a matter of taste based on how much interest you have in violent criminals. The social constructions that attract certain types of people to the lifestyle is one of the strongest aspects and is portrayed in a fairly seductive way by the filmmakers. However, the extreme violence, greed, selfishness, and disloyalty of the main characters is rightly emphasised in scenes that linger in the memory.It is notable for naturalistic and entertaining dialogue that stems from improvisation during rehearsals. Virtually all characters have the opportunity to contribute and there are so many memorable lines it is hard to pick favourites.Visually for me it is a masterpiece. There is so much iconic cinematography, perfectly cut together and enhanced by music from the era. Michael Ballhaus and Thelma Schoonmaker are as much the stars as the actors. I never tire of watching that walkthrough at the Copacabana.Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro, Paul Sorvino, and Lorraine Bracco are all amazing. However, Joe Pesci stands out as a terrifyingly murderous ""funny guy"".It is one of those films that is too good in some ways. It has such an impact that it prompts life to imitate art. Just like 'Jaws' made people go out and kill sharks, I know of 'Goodfellas' fans who emulate the mannerisms and personality traits of characters like Tommy, Paulie and Jimmy (minus the brutal murders) because they think its cool.

"Joe Pesci born on February 9th, 1943","If you have not seen the film, Goodfellas (1990), yet, make it a goal to do so. Robert De Niro was already a huge heavyweight in Hollywood when this film came out. Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta would become household names, once this film was released. Martin Scorsese used his skills, as a film auteur and editor, to craft an amazing piece of Mafia crime drama. It is based on true events and characters found in the book ""Wiseguy"". The film chronicles the story of Mafia associate Henry Hill JR. From the years 1955-1980.As you see young Henry grow up from selling and moving stolen cigarettes, to his days as an FBI informant, it is not the story that totally drives the film, but the execution by director Scorsese and the actors. It is an Academy Award winner that captures the feeling of the Mafia, as well as, the period pieces that it chronicles. Even though it takes place in a recent history, it still captures a charm from the olden days, which probably owes a gratitude to the great vast Italian culture, that gives it that galvanizing, vintage appeal.

Based on Nichola Pleggi's book 'wise guy', this masterpiece directed by the phenomenal Martin Scorsese, narrates the true story of an Irish-Italian mobster- Henry Hill spanning over a period of 30 years.Coming from a working class background in Brooklyn, Henry who always wanted to be a mobster was taken under the wings by a local gangster 'Paulie' at the age of 11. Initially running small errands, Henry gradually went up the ladder to become one of the closest associates to Paulie.
The fascinating mob culture and its ghastly, gut wrenching business hiding behind the glamourous life of new York city mafia from the 50s to the 80s is exposed through Henry's eyes.Henry and his associates had pulled up one of the largest heists in American history- The Lufthansa theft after which a number of mobsters where brutally killed by them out of paranoia.
However greed, deceit, drugs and certain catastrophic choices eventually lead to the downfall of this mafia in 1980.This movie has a stellar cast and mind-blowing performances by the legendary actor Robert De Niro as James Burke or Jimmy- the master mind behind the heist, Joe Pesci who won an Oscar for his role as the psychotic Tommy DeVito, Ray Liotta as Henry and Lorraine Bracco.Probably one of Martin Scorsese's finest mobster movie this classic is a must watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Masterpiece,"Goodfellas is my favourite movie of all time, and with so many incredible movies out there that's the best thing I could ever say about it. Great performances, masterful directing, an incredible soundtrack and a gripping story about rising to the top only to drop right back down to the bottom that really goes to show that all good things must come to an end. This is Martin Scorsese's best movie, hands down. The flawless blend of engrossing drama and flawless comedy with a little bit of drugs and violence mixed in to spice it up makes this a must watch for everyone, except kids it's probably not a great idea to watch this with anyone under the age of 12. Oh and Joe Pesci is absolute perfection.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Must See Movie.,"The best gangster movie ever made for mine. A superstar cast with De Niro, Liotta and Pesci at their very best, with a very solid and good supporting cast. Based on a true story, the movie follows some friends from their teenage years into adulthood. Their journey is a treacherous and murderess one, as they become involved with the Mafia. These Goodfellas live a lavish lifestyle, but after years of greed and corruption eventually their world comes crashing down. The story is interesting and well told, there's plenty of detail, but no overkill. The main characters all have a strong presence, at times they are likable, but don't be fooled. There is lots of double cross's, violence and shootings which is part of the territory in a tale like this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Goodfellas (1990) The best mafia movie in history?,"There are countless mafia films that are well remembered and loved by the public. Many are even considered part of the best films in history. Goodfellas is one of those great titles. The way the story begins already leaves the viewer completely caught up in the plot. The story is very engaging and the pacing is sensational. The film is long and at many points it is not even possible to notice the time passing. The actors are fantastic, there is no average performance throughout the film. Perhaps the only lower moment in the film is in the final hour, where a certain moment seems more dragged out than the rest. In short, Martin Scorsese's direction is perfect, all the scenes are beautiful and this is certainly one of the best mafia films in history, going head to head with The Godfather.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"A Symphony of Crime, Chaos, and Cinematic Brilliance","Goodfellas by Martin Scorsese is an undisputed masterpiece, a cinematic triumph that seamlessly blends drama and crime to create an unforgettable exploration of the mob's seductive yet ruthless world. Every frame of this film is a testament to Scorsese's unparalleled ability to immerse audiences in a narrative that is as gripping as it is brutal. The story unfolds with precision and authenticity, peeling back the layers of organized crime with a raw honesty that few films dare to attempt.What truly elevates Goodfellas to legendary status is its technical brilliance. Scorsese's use of cinematography is nothing short of genius, from the iconic single-take tracking shot at the Copacabana a mesmerizing sequence that perfectly encapsulates the allure and chaos of the mob lifestyle to the dynamic angles and freeze frames that punctuate critical moments, pulling the audience deeper into the narrative. Each shot feels meticulously crafted, serving not only as a visual feast but also as an essential storytelling device.The soundtrack, a masterstroke in itself, transports viewers through the decades with era-defining songs that enhance the emotional resonance of each scene. Every track is impeccably chosen, intertwining seamlessly with the action on screen and amplifying its impact. It's not just a playlist it's a narrative tool that breathes life into the story, making the highs more exhilarating and the lows even more harrowing.Of course, the performances are nothing short of extraordinary. Ray Liotta delivers a career-defining portrayal of Henry Hill, capturing both the charm and desperation of a man caught between loyalty and survival. Robert De Niro brings a magnetic intensity to his role, embodying quiet menace and calculated power, while Joe Pesci delivers one of the most electrifying performances in cinematic history. His ""Funny how?"" scene remains a masterclass in tension, unpredictability, and character work, a moment so riveting it has become etched in the annals of film history.Goodfellas is more than just a crime film-it's a profound meditation on power, loyalty, ambition, and the consequences of a life built on lies and violence. Its rich narrative, breathtaking technical execution, and timeless themes make it a cornerstone of modern cinema. With this film, Scorsese cements himself as one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, delivering a work that will be studied, admired, and cherished for generations to come. Simply put, Goodfellas is not just a movie it's an experience, a masterpiece that transcends genre to stand as one of the finest achievements in cinematic history.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

"Like a great symphony, every note rings true","The closest comparison I can find is Godfather II, a movie in which every bit of dialog in every scene is spot on, and delivered perfectly by a stellar cast. There is no fluff, or a single line that is superfluous or that sounds improbable.As great as De Niro and Pesci are, my pick for best actor is Ray Liotta. His frantic, borderline sociopathic, personable smooth-talking wiseguy turn as Henry Hill is in my top ten of all time great portrayals. Michael Madsen almost got the role and would have been great, but I think too menacing. Ray Liotta had the balance of vulnerability, charm, and violent thug vibe that made him Henry Hill. He was the pivot point between De Niro's calculating Jimmy and Pesci's cowboy Tommy. Perfection.And the soundtrack - oh my - where did Martin Scorsese find the inspiration? Great tunes that transport you right to the 60s and into the 70s without even realizing it.It's sad that Dances With Wolves one best picture in 1990, because while not a bad movie, it didn't have the realism or impact that Goodfellas had for me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

one of the more important films of our time,"When he was asked to name the best films of the 1990s, film critic Roger Ebert not only ranked Martin Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"" as the best next to ""Fargo"" (1996) but also labeled it ""the best mob movie ever."" A friend of Scorsese's, Ebert also labeled the filmmaker as the finest director in the United States today. To me, ""Goodfellas"" is not the best film about organized crime. That reward goes to ""The Godfather"" (1972). But if there ever was a film to replace ""The Godfather"" (1972) as the best mafia movie, ""Goodfellas"" would be it.""Goodfellas"" is one of those rare cases where a true story about violence and ferocity is adapted for the screen but without bringing it to a glorious sense like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962). The said 60s film took a tale of heroism mixed with narcissistic violence to create a sweeping epic. What Scorsese does is take the dark plot of the underworld and the mafia and make it look exactly like what it was and still is today. It is a fabulous retelling of the story of Henry Hill, a part-Italian kid who grew up amongst the mobsters and sought to become one of them.Unlike other mob movies, ""Goodfellas"" does not make heroes or role models out of its characters. The movie centers around the people of the mafia underworld and avoids the civilians who would ultimately become victims of them and their ways. Instead, Scorsese and co-screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi make cruel and dislikable characters and masterfully command the cast into representing them. Most particularly is the character played by Joe Pesci. The character, again based on a real-life person, is like a tender human explosive. Just touch the surface of it and it goes off, tearing or blowing apart anything that provokes it. Pesci's character is the kind of man who if you insult him verbally, even as a joke, he will beat you half to death or just whip out his gun and empty it into your heart and then sit down and finish whatever he was doing in the first place and not shed a tear or let out a sigh of regret over your mangled remains. Like a wild animal, he is unpredictable and cannot be controlled; only put down. And the sickening thing is that Robert De Niro's character is actually fond of this monstrosity of a man. We only learn the bad sides of these men; not their good sides, for they probably lost it all when they joined the mafia. We see them cheat on their spouses, murder people in broad daylight, traffic drugs, destroy property, and again, they do it for their own satisfaction. There's no morality, not even among themselves. The movie opens with a brutal scene of what these men do and yet the Ray Liotta character immediately states afterward: ""As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster. To me, being a gangster was better than being President of the United Statesit was there that I knew that I belonged.""This is a brutal and savage world these men lived in and Martin Scorsese excellently brings this back to screen to give us a new impression of the mafia and reminds us that these kind of people still exist today and are not heroes or images for civilized people not even in the vaguest sense. In regards to the cast, it is perfect. Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, and Joe Pesci (who won an Oscar for his performance) were quintessentially cast in their roles. The only part I thought was wrongly developed was Lorraine Bracco's character. I just felt the character was either too over the top or Bracco overacted a little, but this is a forgivable weakness and it's hardly a weakness at all. There is also the two-and-a-half-hour running time, which I felt was just a little too long. But these few minor flaws aside, ""Goodfellas"" is certainly one of the most important films of the past twenty years in an era where Hollywood seems to have lost its motivation for films beyond the conventional range.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Greatest gangster movie of all time!,"One of the greater if not the greatest gangsta movie to grace the silver screen.

Robert de Niro is as always fantastic as is Ray Liotta a role that made his career and showed his talent as a versatile actor, but the stand out performance goes to Joe Pesci who in the same year had us in stitches as the bumbling thief in Hone Alone here puts on of the most terrifying performances that cements him in cinema history as one of the most dangerous and evil characters.

How do you define a classic? You watch this film !,"I remember that this is one of the first films that I've ever seen that deserved to be called a ""classic."" I was absolutely mind blown, I was even shocked that the film is two and a half hours long but had just been sucked in for so long.This film has some of the best acting you will ever see in your life. Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci (who deserved his Oscar), Robert De Nero, Lorraine Bracco. Everybody was fantastic ! Everyone just deserved an Oscar. Ray Liotta and and Lorraine both gave effective and entertaining voice over narration and even the smaller roles from the likes of Samuel L. Jackson where entertaining.The music was incredible, there is no score, its more of a combination of famous songs from the 50's 60's and 70's (matching the decades in which the film is set) and they all work, none of the songs feel shoe-horned, and they all pleasant to listen to.This is Scorsese's best work, which is a big claim, and well earned. The shots were all great, including the tracking shot that has now become world famous and is taught in film schools all over the world.

Classic!,"Goodfellas:A young man grows up in the mob and works very hard to advance himself through the ranks. He enjoys his life of money and luxury, but is oblivious to the horror that he causes.

All the aspects you look for in a mobster film are just perfect in Goodfellas. From the voiceover in the beginning, to the songs, the acting (from a superb cast), the action, and the visuals; they're all just perfect.

Every time I see Pesci I think Mafia stooge; that's just the way he comes off in all his movies. He plays his role to perfection. He definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. De Niro was fantastic too, although this wasn't the normal role he plays. He was still a tough guy in this movie, but he was really paranoid throughout the whole thing.

Good-Not-Greatfellas,"Another in a series of movies from my list of shame that I'm catching up on. I'd never seen this, but knew some of the famous lines, which is no surprise given the popularity and high status this movie has.Sadly, I grew up knowing Pesci from Home Alone and Gone Fishin' and My Cousin Vinny. I never caught him in these career defining roles. The man is terrifying with the intensity he brings. De Niro I knew from Meet the Parents and Stardust, I never got to experience the powerhouse performances. Ray Liotta.. I've seen him in stuff but he never made much impression on me. Aside from the big three, everyone in this is solid, there's no bad performances bringing it down.Sadly, I think this suffers because I've seen other gangster movies. This feels sooooo much like every other mob movie. A lower grade Godfather, a less stylish Pulp Fiction, not as epic as The Irishman, and not as The Departed, it doesn't even explore the taxing nature of these lives as well Donnie Brasco. Almost all of these follow a young man coming up in the mob, loving it at first and then suffering for it.What Goodfellas has gong for it is a collection of exceptional moments. The overall movie may feel oddly derivative to me but there's no doubt that some scenes are exceptional. It's definitely an odd experience because I know this predates almost all of those but that's not been my experience and it definitely suffers in my eyes because of it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

A mistaken meme brought me here.,"Goodfellas is a terrifying film. This is why I've not rewatched it in decades. I'm here now because a meme reminded me of it, that's terrible reason to watch a film, but it's the truth and it's probably the truth that makes this terrifying. Although this is a dramatised account, it's based on the true story of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta). ""As far back as I can remember I wanted to be a gangster"", that's pretty much Henry's opening line as he shuts the trunk on a dead body killed by Jimmy (Robert De Niro) and Tommy (Joe Pesci) and that in a nutshell sums up the film. People tied together by violent crime. Henry is half Irish, half Italian. Growing up around the local gangsters, learning the ropes, making connections, making money, getting respect. This introduction to young Henry is important. It hammers home the family function of the mob. Once in, nothing penetrates it. It's bred into you. You'd die for each other. You'd kill too. Goodfellas is about more than killing and stealing though. It's about loyalty, vanity, masculinity. You can almost smell the screen. There's a tense underbelly to every scene. Be it Tommy's unhinged temper or Henry's greed. Henry narrates throughout. He meets Karen (Lorraine Bracco). To begin with she seems his equal and that's what he likes. Quickly she learns that Henry is dangerous, but she likes that too... and marries him. Once you're in. You can't get out. Not even if you want to. The dialogue is rapid, you feel like you're in a pressure cooker. The camera too is always on the move, but boy does it move beautifully. Through rooms, kitchens, everyday life and energy oozes from the screen. Let's not pretend it's not absolutely brutal though. Yes it's packed with style, yes it's the characters that make it tick, but when the guns are drawn, or the knives, clubs, anything to hand, it's bloody! Sooner or later, someone's going to make a mistake. Tommy is that someone and the mistake is the body in the trunk in the pre-titles scene. It's one of many mines planted in the story, buried ironically. Left, ticking. The mob lifestyle goes on, but these things are there. Remembered by those biding their time. Honestly it's not an easy watch. There's no good guys, the title is a total lie. Every single person on screen is a scumbag. After setting the scene for an hour, the scumbags start the infighting and the cracks begin to show. The genius of this though is how it keeps you hooked. The pacing is perfection. Henry encounters bumps, does time, his marriage on the rocks, but on it goes. He's digging deeper though and soon digging into coke against Paulie's (Paul Sorvino) wishes. Massive heists attract the FBI. Too many fingers in too many pies. Even as the trio of Henry, Jimmy and Tommy galvanise and try to cover their tracks, it's too late as things unravel to classic American needle drops. They thought they were safe. High enough up the food chain, but they've not spotted their vulnerability. It's a brilliant film from start to end, but you know what? That meme... it was from Casino!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
A timeless classic should be the standard that any film maker should aim for.,"Wow. This film is it. This is everything that makes a good film great and a great film legendary. Based on a true story spanning 30 years in the Mafia, this translation of Henry Hill's story to the movie screen was executed perfectly and stands as an obvious classic 25 years later.Absolutely everything in this film is on point. The directing of 'Goodfellas' by Martin Scorsese is something of a landmark in film itself, how the man didn't win an Oscar for best director for this is beyond me. However, Scorsese's job must've certainly been easier whilst directing this set of actors who absolutely blew me away. The set and costume designs were also fantastic as they create a world that sucks you in and consumes your brain for it's run time.Robert De Niro and Ray Liotta are both superb in portraying their characters and bringing them to life for an audience on the big screen, De Niro is tremendous as usual and Liotta was a perfect casting choice for Henry Hill. Liotta's scene where he walks across the street to confront the man was sexually harassing Karen and then begins to bash his skull in with a pistol is seriously one of the most memorable, timeless and also haunting scenes in the film. Henry Hill's anger and expression stay with you for a while after that scene, despite it being pretty short.Whilst my hat is off the whole cast and crew behind this absolutely timeless classic, the man my applauds have to go to Joe Pesci. Pesci's portrayal as Tommy in this film is sensational, he owns the screen in every single scene he is in and undoubtedly deserved his Oscar for this performance. The improvised ""How am I funny?"" scene chokes you out with tension, tension only really being there because you never know what a man like Tommy DeVito could do and that is something Joe Pesci represented in this perfectly.In my opinion, 'Goodfellas' is one of the greatest films of all time that has the perfect mix of sensational writing, acting and directing, bringing it all together to create a memorable and beautiful film that is re-watchable over and over.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
The Second Pinnacle in the gangster genre.,"""GoodFellas"" is a 1990 gangster movie and is arguably one of the greatest movies out there. I had high expectations for this movie as it was directed by Scorsese, and featured De Niro from ""The Godfather Part II"" and ""Taxi Driver"" and this movie did not disappoint at all.This is along with ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather Part II"" some of the greatest movies out there and really represent the peak for gangster movies. Everything about this movie alone is perfect, from the pace of the movie to the cinematography to the acting. The acting is flawless from start to end and in my opinion, features some of the best performances I have ever seen. The performances were so great that it gave every scene the appropriate level of suspense. Well done De Niro, Pesci, Liotta, Bracco, and other supporting actors.This film is very well-paced and goes at its own rhythm and does not feel rushed o slowed-down at any point, and the story just naturally unfolds and is told to us as we are watching. Another note in the plot, the movie is very unpredictable at times and has a great element of surprise, as it includes some very unexpected events occur.On the technical side of the movie, it delivers as much as the plot and acting, the editing of the movie is excellent, it is just right for this movie, and does not feel like the editing style is trying to fit in this movie. The soundtrack is nearly perfect and delivers along with the performances of the appropriate level of suspense and intensity in each scene of the movie.Overall, GoodFellas is one great movie and automatically a classic in the gangster genre and in general movies as well. It struggles to have a weakness at any moment in this film. Everything in this movie feels like a perfect. Do yourself and at least watch this once in your lives.

Easily One of the Greatest Movies Ever Made,"If you haven't seen it, make an effort to witness what is definitely one of the greatest movies of all time, ever made. This is a true masterpiece from start to finish. It's chilling how well it is made and delivered. Scorcese directs this on fire. It has one of the best prologues and also a great epilogue that ties everything together.Based on a true story, half-Irish hoodlum Henry Hill aspires to climb the ranks of the New York mob in the 1960's and 70's. He teams up with an unforgettable cast of characters lead by Deniro and Pesci to establish organized crime syndicate. While their success grows, troubles begin to arise, and Hill, Tommy, and Jimmy Conway must cover their tracks as the feds, other crews, and other members close in on them.The stylish drama contains some of the best shot scenes in history, scenes as mundane as Deniro puffing a cigarette, a celebrational Christmas party, Pesci's funny storytelling, husband and wife stuff, and one of the best filmed scenes itself where the camera longtracks Liotta and Bracco from behind as they go for their first real date to a restaurant and mobster meet up.One of the most influential crime dramas in history, Goodfellas also has undeniable consistent dark comedy undertones, and the twists are always shocking and entertaining.

There's always one in every crowd,"I didn't read more than a few other reviews and they were all 10 stars. I'm going to be the fly in the ointment and give it a 7, which still ain't bad. And it ain't - I mean isn't - bad at all, by any means. Nor, in my book, is it anywhere near great. Not by a long shot. It may be due, largely, although not sure yet, to Joe Pesci's one note characterization (way too typical of him). A little ""f"" word here and there never hurt nobody but goes just so far. It becomes not so much an aspect of his psychopathology but, with its over emphasis, weakens it, parodying what might be very legitimate. He was insane, and not a joke, but the character becomes jokey. How Ray Liotta did not get acknowledged for a much more realistic portrayal, and get at least a nomination for a part he brought dimensionality to, is a mystery. But, of course, the whole concept of an Academy Award is a mystery in and of itself. I mean, after all - Charlton Heston (in anything)?; Shirley Jones when you have Janet Leigh?; Rita Moreno opposite Judy Garland as well as Fay Bainter and Lotte Lenya?; not to mention the even more outrageous selection of Chakiris vs Clift and Geo. C. Scott?; Grace Kelly vs. Judy Garland????? Now, really! That one is going too far. And so on and forth. Give me Pesci in My Cousin Vinny anytime (not even a nomination). Aside from that - there were moments in the film that were clearly wonderful. Bracco and all the other molls getting their faces and nails done, scanning and re-scanning each of their thoughtless faces; the stop motion a dozen or more times capturing the characters silent, still; De Niro smiling at you with one of his 2 faces barely showing the 2nd face that will soon emerge and become the easy victor; the sense of confusion and then addiction that Liotta captures; the latter part where he describes in repetitive detail, in his drug-addled way, the order of the evening and transporting the pounds of cocaine to another city; dinner table with Mom and the 3 boys while the body in the trunk is writhing.

The truth is, this film doesn't convey anything. There's no central point or conflict. ""Pulp Fiction"", a much better film, pulled off the lack of a main central conflict, but without any characterization, or a sense of a real journey this film suffers the same fate as the boring ""Aviator"". The story of a real person with a lot of glitz and gloss galore in every seen but a severe lack of content. Every seen moves very fast and everything happens instaneously and they use a narrator to fill in the blanks of information they use narrators.

The horrible lives of gangsters,"I am not much of a fan of maffia films but I see the great quality of this film. The acting, the direction, the camera work, the sets and costumes are all top notch. This film kept me interested and engaged throughout, if a bit baffled at the depressingly violent lives that the characters chose to live.We follow the life of a gangster with a voiceover (unnecessary in my view) telling us how young Henry is attracted to the glamour and power of the gangster lifestyle from childhood. It appears to be his only way out of a boring working class life.Henry makes his way up the ranks, although he realises that as a non-Italian he will never reach the top. Other than the money and the power it is difficult to understand what it is Henry enjoys about his maffia life. The mobsters live in a claustrophobic, paranoid world, where supposed friends can turn on each other at any moment. Most of the mobsters are obnoxious, violent psychopaths as well as complete morons. They blow their blood money on tacky homes, cars and clothes, greedy wives and sleazy girlfriends.Henry's wife gets a voice in this movie too, which is interesting. She willingly chooses this mobster to start a family with, despite the danger, the stress and the trauma it causes to her children (which we see crying a lot).All in all, all of the main characters come across as highly unsympathetic and I found it difficult to understand what kept them in the horror lives they were living. But then again, once you've entered the world of crime, it is probably very difficult to get out.So, perhaps it was a morality tale: stay away from the world of crime and drugs are bad, m'kay.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

"A Thoroughly Investigated, Extensively Detailed & Wickedly Amusing Crime Opus","An extensively investigated, thoroughly detailed & wickedly amusing crime opus that's stylishly directed & brilliantly acted, Goodfellas is considered by some to be an even better crime drama than Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather and while I don't share the same sentiment, I don't deny its influence & impact on the films that followed into its footsteps.Goodfellas chronicles the rise & fall of mob associate Henry Hill & his friends from the 1950s to 1980s. The story follows his journey in the mafia world, covering his relationship with his wife and his two associates Jimmy Conway & Tommy DeVito, as the trio work their way up through the mob hierarchy, and culminates with the events that lead to their eventual downfall.Directed by Martin Scorsese, the film begins in the middle and then work its way around it before coming full circle in the end, thus taking us on a riotous journey that's never tiring. The dialogues are sharp & piercing, the chemistry between the trio has a genuine quality & a sense of brotherhood to it. The violence is brutal & unflinching, and the characters are lively & compelling.The filmmaking technicalities are handled really well, giving its images a frenzied vibe as if things may explode anytime without warning, and they do on multiple occasions. Also notable is the neat cinematography that makes its apt set pieces stand out. But the story as a whole still feels longer than it needed to be, and its 145 minutes runtime is severely felt during the second half.Coming to the performances, Goodfellas features a reliable cast in Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci & Ray Liotta, with Pesci stealing the show with a wild, deranged act that overshadows all in his vicinity. Liotta is in as Henry Hill and delivers an impressive lead show that only gets better with time. De Niro chips in with an assured input yet he feels somewhat under-utilised. Lorraine Bracco & Paul Sorvino also provide excellent support and leave a lasting impression of their own.On an overall scale, Goodfellas captures the glamorous & grisly side of organised crime with finesse and offers a consistently thrilling ride to finish as a fascinating example of its genre. The story is at its best when the screen is shared by the trio but loses steam when it focuses on their individual lives. Riveting at first, the film ends up running a tad too long for me and the interest is already lost by the time it nears its conclusion. A well-researched account of a real-life story, Goodfellas is admirable in its own ways but to rank it alongside The Godfather is pure lunacy.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

"Good, but glorifies violence","This is a good movie, but I kind of know I am getting in bed with people I don't want to associate with in praising it.  There are those--many--who will just like the glorification of violence because they are shallow and they have created some kind of false bravado in place of real courage.  In other words, they are the kind of phonies who talk a big game and think they are pimps, but haven't an ounce of sexiness, character or true backbone.Now that I have dissociated myself from this group who likes the film, I will say that Liotta delivers an outstanding performance, and that the movie is very well done.  But it's just a movie, and not a life-changing one.  (Neither is Fight Club, for many of the same reasons).

Did I watch the same movie as everyone else?,"I'm a Martin Scorcese fan as much as the next film lover. Having made at least 1 of the best films of the decade for each decade since the 70's, the director and his oeuvre are legendary. That's why when I finally sat down to watch ""Goodfellas,"" a film that many consider to be in the upper echelons of his work, I was surprised at how underwhelmed I ultimately felt.Now, being underwhelmed does not equate to thinking this is a bad movie. The craft of this film is undeniable. Each setting is lavishly and painstakingly created to transport us into the many different time periods the story covers, the ensemble cast is impeccable, the dialogue is always lively and engaging, and the camera work is timeless. Everything comes together perfectly to portray mafioso life as sleek, stylish, and sexy, as well as cold-blooded, two-faced, and horrific all at once.Where the movie falters for me is in a lack of tension, a flaw of both screenplay and directing alike. All the above-mentioned descriptors can be captured in the first scene alone. Crazy mafia activity ensues, and enthralls us for what is going to come next. But then, at least in my experience, nothing comes next. It's scene after scene that can capture a facet of gangster life: how unhinged a character is, the irony of the lives being lived, etc. But it never ramps up to something greater, either in action or drama.Take the main protagonist, Henry Hill, for example. In the first scene, he utters his iconic line, ""As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster."" So he does just that. He becomes a gangster with ease, rises through the ranks, gets married, experiences some hardships, some betrayals, standard gangster stuff. The movie portrays this all as matter-of-factly as I just did.There's no character arc to speak of here. He never really changes or even struggles internally. The only things that change are the situations he is involved in. But with all the conflict being of a strictly external nature, even where the set-up is begging for some internal conflict, it never truly hit the dramatic boiling point I thought it should have. To be honest, it never even really got close.That was my experience with ""Goodfellas"": all flash and no substance. I can't be too harsh on it, because again, it's about as perfect of a portrayal of the gangster life as there is. For myself however, if I want that experience to include actual drama and tension, I'll be revisiting ""The Godfather"" instead. If I want Scorcese's unique flavoring of the genre, I'll pick ""The Departed"" any day of the week.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Really better than THE GODFATHER ?,"The answer is no. After seeing the hype of the movie and many people saying that ""Goodfellas"" is better than ""THE GODFATHER,"" I watched this movie last night and I say, how can people compare this movie with the epic THE GODFATHER? ""Goodfellas"" is not that great to compare with THE GODFATHER; ""Goodfellas"" is just okay. It's way out of the league to compare with THE EPIC GODFATHER. ""Goodfellas"" is just another average crime/drama film. Why I'm saying that is written in the brief review below:As a cinema lover, I approached ""Goodfellas"" with high expectations, but I found it to be more of a chore than an engaging experience. While the film is praised for its direction and performances, I felt it lacked a compelling narrative and character depth.The pacing was all over the place, making the story feel drawn out and occasionally boring. Instead of building tension, the lengthy sequences often left me disinterested. The characters, while well-acted, were largely unlikable and failed to evoke any empathy. I found myself struggling to connect with their motivations and choices.Furthermore, the glamorization of organized crime felt troubling. Instead of presenting a balanced view, the film often romanticizes a lifestyle of violence and betrayal, which can send the wrong message to impressionable viewers.""Goodfellas"" didn't live up to the hype for me. It's certainly a cinematic technical achievement, but I was left feeling indifferent by the end. It's a film that may resonate with some, but for others, it falls flat.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Joe Pesci, who I usually find funny, began to irritate me but Paul Sorvino's Pauly truly made me feel like I could identify with these characters...he was awesome!

Scorsese at his Best,"Goodfellas is the best Mafia/gangster movie of all time, and one of the greatest movies ever. One of the greatest things about Goodfellas is the very wide range of emotions, moods, expressions, and atmosphere along with the very quick change between them. In a way the ending leaves you with a sort strange feeling, wondering 'should I be happy or sad?' In one way you even want to be a gangster because you see them laughing, happy, having fun and such a good time, but then suddenly it shows them killing or robbing the innocent, and then you don't really want to live like that. Sometimes even a mixture of the two settings to make you feel especially strange. It shows them both so well and at the same time that every person who sees the movie interprets it in a different way. Sometimes the mood they feel depends on the mood before the movie starts.

The Greatest Mob Film Ever?

Martin Scorsese directs & nicely creates the dark atmosphere surrounding this film by making it gritty & realistic but the story, which in simple terms depicts the rise & fall of Henry Hill in the mobster world, felt like going on & on without any idea of where it's headed & soon I found myself completely detached to it. Joe Pesci outshines among the performers followed by brilliant Ray Liotta as Henry Hill. As for Robert De Niro, he wasn't used to his full potential and felt unneeded in this film. Period.

Pesci is not convincing as a maniacal mobster. He is almost cartoonish. Pesci's Tommy DeVito versus Luca Brasi is a huge mismatch. Ray Liotta is mediocre as the character Henry Hill. Paul Sorvino plays his Mafia kingpin character as tongue-in-cheek. Don't compare him to Brando's Corleone. The musical score, screen play, cinematography and directing is slighly above average.

Each of these narratives, while grounded in audacious fiction, left indelible marks on my cinematic memory. But none could quite surpass the experience offered by Martin Scorsese's magnum opus, ""Goodfellas."" A testament to the adage that fact can be stranger than fiction, Goodfellas not only mesmerized me but also reshaped my understanding of the power of storytelling.While Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" is hailed as the greatest film of all time, for me, ""Goodfellas"" ascends a step further. Beyond just being a film, it's an immersive experience, creating a world so compelling that one doesn't simply watch, but rather, becomes a part of it.""Goodfellas"" is no mere movie. It is a high-octane ride through the treacherous, yet intoxicating underbelly of the mafia. Scorsese adapts Nicholas Pileggi's novel, ""Wiseguy,"" to present a gripping narrative rooted in reality, thus proving that a true story, when well-told, can be as, if not more, captivating than fictional works.The dialogues of the film are a tour de force - memorable, impactful, and infinitely quotable. They're a powerful testament to Scorsese's skillful storytelling, etching themselves into your memory and sparking conversation years after you've left the cinema.The cinematography is nothing short of masterful. Each shot, each angle, each frame serves a purpose, painting a vivid picture of a world not many of us know, but are nevertheless intrigued by. Scorsese takes you on a visual journey that's as captivating as it is unsettling.At the heart of ""Goodfellas"" is Joe Pesci's electrifying performance as Tommy DeVito, for which he earned a well-deserved Oscar. His ten-second acceptance speech at the Academy Awards stands as a symbol of his raw and pure talent - no frills needed. Pesci's portrayal of DeVito is arguably one of the greatest performances in film history, embodying a character so complex and volatile, it's impossible to look away.The pacing of ""Goodfellas"" is a masterclass in filmmaking. There's never a dull moment as Scorsese expertly navigates through decades of organized crime, maintaining the narrative tension throughout. The movie flows like a torrential river, carrying its audience through a whirlwind of emotions.Complementing the visuals and narrative is the incredible soundtrack that pulsates through every scene, enhancing the emotional landscape of the characters. From the adrenaline rush of the criminal high life to the unnerving paranoia induced by overindulgence in drugs, the music adds a layer of authenticity that amplifies the cinematic experience.""Goodfellas,"" in essence, is a cinematic tour de force, a triumph in storytelling that pushes the boundaries of film, and the #1 movie in my list.

Just as great as The Godfather,"Ever wonder what inspired the popular crime drama TV series The Sopranos?

It's one of the best crime movies ever made and it is probably Scorsese's best crime movie by far. He made other successful crime movies like The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) and The Irishman (2019). Goodfellas tells us the story of a young boy growing up in a poor neighborhood who aspires to be a gangster, the boy moves through adolescence and joins the mafia. The main and most important character is played by Ray Liotta (R. I. P.) who is also famous for voicing Tommy Vercetti in the 2002 video game Grand Theft Auto Vice City. The cast in Goodfellas is perfect and even has Robert De Niro who played young Vito Corleone. Joe Pesci has some memorable moments and good quotes like the scene where he asks if he is funny like a clown.

Got to be one of the best Mob Movies,"Goodfellas has got to be one of the best mob movies I have seen. Not only that, it is probably the best Scorsese film I have seen so far. The acting, the dialogues, the setting, everything in this film is brilliant. Anyone who watches this film is guaranteed to love it. The plot is based on a true story of a real life mobster Henry Hill. It follows his beginnings as a kid growing up in Brooklyn who eventually works for a crime family. The reason why he wants to work for a crime family, is because ""as far back as he can remember he always wanted to be a gangster."" Henry's life as a mobster forms the rest of the movie. Henry Hill is played by Ray Liotta, an actor that I wish to see more on the big screens. His portrayal of the real life gangster is as realistic as it gets. From the mannerisms to the speech delivery, it is almost like we are all thinking this is a real gangster. Robert De Niro plays Jimmy Gent, who takes Henry under his wing and in a way mentors him. The other guy Jimmy takes with him and who eventually works with Henry is Tommy DeVito, played by Joe Pesci. This to me is the best performance of the film. DeVito is a character with a short fuse and Pesci played the character to perfection. This film shows why he is one of the finest actors of his generation and why he won an Oscar for his role. To me, his performance is what you will think of when the movie is over. All in all this was a fantastic film and definitely one of the best mob movies ever.

Just a Bunch of Neighborhood Guys,"If The Godfather (1972) is grand opera, Goodfellas is Grand Guignol. The violence is sudden and brutal, with no effort at cosmetics. This is a blue-collar crime ring Hill (Liotta) belongs to, with connections to the Mafia. They've got just enough juice to act with impunity. Shoot a kid waiter— don't worry about the law; after all, that's what the payoffs are for. Want to impress your girl with a table up front at the Copa— don't worry they'll make one. These are criminal entrepreneurs, looking to make a buck anywhere, except dealing dope (too risky, I guess), that is, until Hill fatefully succumbs. It's an exciting life, as long as you stay on the right side of the unwritten rules. So, even the underworld operates by a standard of justice, namely their own. As to the rest of the world—that's made up of 9 to 5 schnooks.Liotta turns in a fine controlled performance in the central role of Henry Hill. Ditto, DeNiro as the dangerous Jimmy. But, Pesci is all out psychotic as Tommy. It's hard to see how the gang could put up with a nutty loose cannon like him even if he does furnish the movie with its edgy appeal. Scorcese directs with down-home gusto, focusing almost as much on family life as the criminal. Still, the 160-minute result could easily have been trimmed back. That would have tightened the impact.Nonetheless, the movie is a fascinating look at urban crime, proletarian style.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
This Movie Is Not Perfect Or A Masterpiece,"On and off not very often but on the odd occasion I would hear how great this movie really is, it's one of the best and of course the multiple mentions and references this movie was used on The Sopranos. It wasn't until this current rewatch of The Sopranos that I decided to finally make the time to sit down and watch GoodfellasI wasn't very impressed or fond of this movie at all. I don't see what's so great about it that many others have claimed to see in Goodfellas. What? Just because it was a mobster movie that was surprisingly also based on a true story? That part of it being a true story I found was slightly interesting but man does this movie SUCK!!! The 2 and half hour length doesn't justify how bland Goodfellas isIt's not exciting or engaging. I sat there watching the whole thing and felt nothing but disappointment and confusion as to how others love this movie so much. But then again, this is my thoughts and feelings and my thoughts and feelings for the movie only. I know for a fact when and if this review gets notices Im going to get a lot of intentional people saying this review wasn't helpful based on the fact I do not like this movie at all. It's funny because Im a huge fan of The Sopranos and I do respect that maybe if it wasn't for Goodfellas or even The Godfather that The Sopranos wasn't made and I love the fact there were quite a few Sopranos cast members in Goodfellas. But still, I didn't like this movie one bitIn my opinion this movie is the worst from Martin Scorsese from the others I've seen which were Shutter Island and most recently this weekend both The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver.

GoodFellas,"" scheduled to open Sept. 21 in Chicago, is a memoir of life in the Mafia, narrated in the first person by Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), an Irish-Italian kid whose only ambition, from his earliest teens, was to be a ""wise guy,"" a Mafioso. There is also narration by Karen, the Jewish girl (Lorraine Bracco) who married him, and who discovered that her entire social life was suddenly inside the Mafia; mob wives never went anywhere or talked to anyone who was not part of that world, and eventually, she says, the values of the Mafia came to seem like normal values. She was even proud of her husband for not lying around the house all day, for having the energy and daring to go out and steal for a living. There is a real Henry Hill, who disappeared into the anonymity of the federal government's witness protection program, and who over a period of four years told everything he knew about the mob to the reporter Nicholas Pileggi, whose Wiseguy: Life in a Mafia Family was a best-seller. ""GoodFellas"" is about guilt more than anything else. But it is not a straightforward morality play, in which good is established and guilt is the appropriate reaction toward evil. No, the hero of this film feels guilty for not upholding the Mafia code - guilty of the sin of betrayal. And his punishment is banishment, into the witness protection program, where nobody has a name and the headwaiter certainly doesn't know it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"One Word Review: Scorsese's Another Masterpiece, No Doubt.","One word: priceless
If there was one word that I could use to describe Martin Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"": it'd be priceless.A surreal and deeply fascinating take on life of Henry Hill who was involved in the Mob for three decades and his rise throughout the time span (and Nicholas Pileggi's book ""Wiseguy"").There isn't a single moment in the movie where it doesn't miss a beat, you could only tell by the atmosphere of the time period and it seems so real.The performances in this film simply make it even more memorable and how the characters are portrayed here especially by Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci (who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor), and Paul Sorvino are believable and easy to understand that they were a family, very close and tightly knit to the core. Also, how director Martin Scorsese lets the movie pace itself and keeps the viewer off guard in what happens deserves a lot of credit.
My Rating:10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
A Very Impressive Film,"Inventive, with some great performances throughout, and some brilliant directing from Scorsese, Goodfellas serves its right as one of the greatest crime dramas of all time- and at times can be a very fun film to watch. My biggest flaw with the film is the pacing, specifically towards the end, where it seems to be dragging on and overstuffed all at once. I feel in total the film could have been about 10 minutes shorter, but besides its lack in a very satisfying conclusion, the film can be very entertaining. For a film to be nearly 2 and a half hours long, it seems nearly impossible to be as entertaining as it often is. The writing, dialogue, and narration throughout is sharp and very intelligent, and the performances are pure gold- Joe Pesci especially. Robert DeNiro, Ray Liotta, and Lorraine Bracco also provide some very good performances, as well as the rest of the supporting and main cast. The cinematography is excellent, with some truly inventive and fun shots to follow, that simply make the film more enjoyable and endlessly watchable. The soundtrack is also great, as well as the atmosphere it provides for the film, and you will be sure to have a joy watching the film and its many parts at the very least some of the time. In the end, Goodfellas has its slower moments, but more often than not, Scorsese has made a brilliant crime film with some great performances, and lines that will be remembered for years to come.

Best Gangster Movie,"The movie itself its notorious for being one of the best gangster films ever made. Centred on the book 'wise guy', it focuses on how Henry Hill a former gangster worked his way up through the mob family. Without reading the book I didn't know what to expect from the ending which I thought was brilliant.The combination of De Niro, Liotta and Pesci work excellent in this film as you witness them grow into the film as like brothers working under Paulie. I think this movie provides everything you would want to keep watching....Action, Romance, Suspense and even a bit of humour thrown in.Ultimately I would argue this as one of the best movies I've ever seen.

Joe Pesci's character is one of the scariest characters I've ever seen on film or TV. Robert DeNiro is, as usual, terrific, and Ray Liotta plays his part perfectly.The movie is over 2 hours long, but it goes by so quickly that you want to watch it all over again after it's over.The most chilling scene in the movie is the ""Layla"" scene...I've never felt that way about a scene in a movie before.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
A sharp-edges gangster film that has a script that is one the all time best. One of the greatest films of all time,"What makes Goodfellas such an enjoyable film for me would have to be its hard hitting, witty dialogue. If I have to pick a film that is a winner script-wise, Goodfellas would definitely be one of the top contenders. With a script like this, there are many lines that are good enough to be quotable, and it's very long list to choose from. And the desired effect is not only achieved by the script, it had to be the select number of people who be up to the task at bringing out the sharp wit of the characters and we have a cast that really shines in that department.With Ray Liotta playing Henry Hill, his performance in letting you in on the character by putting you through his perspective with his narration alone is enough to pull you in and become captivated by the film. And as he pulls you into his world, we get introduced to numerous criminals he gets mixed up with such as Tommy DeVito played by Joe Pesci, who he plays with a lot of intensity that brings out a lot of the brutal elements in the film. When on screen, you can always sense something is going to go wrong, and what Pesci brings to this character is deserving of all the praise.Every character evokes that sense of intensity that really gives this film its distinctive edge, but one person I seem to be captivated the most by in the movie would have to be Robert De Niro's performance as Jimmy Conway, who is crazier, but in his own more methodical way that is a lot more subtle than Tommy. What Bob brings to the table is something special that again shows how versatile he is as an actor and gives me another reason as to why I think he is the greatest actor ever. He may not be in every scene, but he is the foundation of the movie for me.These are all great performances that help to bring out this story and to know that these are true events makes this film even more insane than it already is. While The Godfather felt more graceful and has placed a heavier emphasis on subtlety to make the violent scenes have more impact when they happen unexpectedly, Goodfellas is sharp all around its edges. Whereas The Godfather was violent, it offered insight into the human aspects of the criminals and the reasons they murdered for business. That sense of sentimentality is nonexistent in Goodfellas and offers a bare bones, raw insight into the crooked lives these criminals were leading, and with that, you get a story that is sharp like a knife that when it hits you, you'll know you'll never forget it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Scorsese at the top of his game,"A Scorsese classic. It ticks all the boxes. Italians, gangsters, lots of fbombs, the lot. It's very well directed and the style changes throughout the film which compliments the narrative, e.g. romanticised and flowing at the beginning to jerky and unrhythmic at the end. The acting was also fantastic with everyone pretty much becoming a stereotype, especially joe Pesci. The script was tight as well, with a great twist at the ending. however I felt like his downfall cane a little too quickly and it ended quite abruptly. Other than that it made gangster life seem kinda appealing...

Not bad but overrated and definitely not the best of Scorsese,"I've been coming across this Scorsese's movie many times but couldn't make myself watch it for some reason despite its super high rating. But since it became cinematography classic I had to watch it some day. And that day is today.I managed to watch the entire movie. Was I impressed as much as after watching the Departed or the Wolf of Wall Street? Definitely no. I have no questions about the quality. Good actors and good acting. Killings are brutal and merciless. But something was missing. It's lacking a good story which would be interesting to watch. I understand that the movie is based on true story and it looks very real. But not every real story is interesting enough to make a good movie.Any of Scorsese's later movies is better in every way. I don't say it is bad, just don't understand why so many 10/10 reviews.

In this train-wreck of a film, Scorsese has the actors bumble across the screen for 2 and a half hours muttering in God-awful ""Italian"" accents. Scorsese probably thought he could capture the brilliance of the Godfather trilogy when he made this film. To say the least, he failed miserably. I pity those who consider Goodfellas a classic.

The complete and true gangster classic...,"This is one of those movies that you can give as a good example anytime you want to mention movie-making brilliance to anyone.""Goodfellas"" is a true gangster classic; a complete picture of the mafia and its operations. Comparisons to ""The Godfather"" movies are inevitable, but I shall say only this: both are great classics in their respective places and deal with separate stories; ""The Godfather"" movies are a riveting look at the goings-on in the life of the Corleone Crime family, while ""Goodfellas"" is a portrayal of the life of the mobsters who actually do all the jobs that some head of a crime family might want done! Also, ""Goodfellas"" has more of a ""jolly"" mood throughout the movie; you find yourself experiencing a feeling of triumph every time they pull off a job! ""The Godfather"" movies on the other hand have more of a somber atmosphere, enhanced by their sepia overtones, and topped off with a very serious and grave approach to story-telling.""Goodfellas"" is based on the true story of a young man named Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) who grows up to be a gangster in the company of other gangsters he has always admired! These include Jimmy (Robert De Niro), Tommy (Joe Pesci) and Paulie (Paul Sorvino).The movie takes an inside look at the operations carried out by the New York Mob. It also shows how Henry along with his partners Jimmy and Tommy, carries out a number of heists.All throughout the movie, these gangsters seem to be having complete fun, with things going their way all the time! It's only towards the end that things start to fall apart....There are some terrific scenes which have already gone down as classics and only get better with repeated viewings; there's some very witty and fantastic dialog (most of which is hogged by the brilliant Joe Pesci).Acting: Ray Liotta is great in the lead; but the best performances are by Robert De Niro (even though he has less screen presence), Joe Pesci (awesome, the way he mouths off the sharp dialog) and Paul Sorvino.

Filmed with a ferocious verve and cinematic yet fly-on-the-wall feel.,"While an argument could be made that 'Goodfellas (1990)' perhaps comes dangerously close to glamourising the gangster lifestyle it portrays, this sprawling and relentless picture depicts three-decades of mob life through the eyes of a real-life ex-mafioso who entered into the witness protection program in the early 1980s and ultimately manages to maintain an impartial stance by simply portraying all the events the way they are remembered to have occurred. Our protagonist also never actually kills anyone and his desperate, drug-fuelled downfall is just as detailed as his seduced start. Scorsese directs the piece with a real ferocious verve and the improvised dialogue lends a genuinely unpredictable edge to most sequences, leading to an almost fly-on-the-wall feel even though the techniques used are inherently cinematic. When the violence explodes onto the screen, it is just as shocking as you'd expect it to be. The only downside of all this is that the already long film feels even longer due to the fast-pace and sheer amount of scenes - a minor complaint since it's all so entertaining. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
A Masterpiece of Crime Cinema,"Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas (1990) is a cinematic triumph that stands as a cornerstone in the genre of crime films. Based on Nicholas Pileggi's nonfiction book Wiseguy, the film chronicles the rise and fall of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) within the Italian-American mob. It's a masterclass in storytelling, character development, and visual style.From the opening sequence, Scorsese immerses the audience in a visceral world where crime and glamour coexist. The film's pace, propelled by Thelma Schoonmaker's razor-sharp editing, keeps viewers riveted, seamlessly transitioning between decades and pivotal moments. The voice-over narration by Liotta adds layers of intimacy and immediacy, making the audience privy to Henry's internal struggles.The performances are stellar. Liotta captures Henry's charisma and vulnerability, while Joe Pesci, as the unhinged Tommy DeVito, delivers a career-defining performance that earned him an Oscar. Robert De Niro's portrayal of Jimmy Conway exudes quiet menace, anchoring the trio with his understated intensity.The film excels in its authenticity, painting a vivid portrait of mob life with Scorsese's signature attention to detail. From the iconic ""Copacabana shot"" to the explosive violence juxtaposed with moments of dark humor, Goodfellas showcases Scorsese's unparalleled ability to balance style and substance.The soundtrack, a medley of period-defining songs, enhances the narrative's emotional depth, creating a cultural tapestry that resonates long after the credits roll.Goodfellas isn't just a film-it's an experience, a visceral journey into the allure and ultimate downfall of a life of crime. It's a must-watch for any cinephile and an enduring masterpiece of modern cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Goodfellas is great,"'Goodfellas' by Martin Scorsese is a highly entertaining gangster film that takes us as the audience away from the typical representation of the gangster life that we are familiar with.

"Reasonably fun, but overrated.","Gangster movies are always popular; they combine the quick action of the Wild West with a certain degree of politeness and courtesy that makes the whole world seem intriguingly different to anything else you've seen. And it makes for reasonable cinema; but it's not the film many people make it out to be. It's enjoyable, and it probably will hold your attention. The fact that it's based on a true story, too, adds a little quality to it that makes it intriguing. But the character development is limited; only De Niro's character really seems to move during the film, and in that way, reality loses out to cinema fiction here. As a documentary, I think something like this would have been very fascinating. As a film, though, it seems to be lacking something somewhere down the line.When all's said and done, it's a decent and enjoyable film, but there are plenty of better films out there. It's worth a watch, sure. It has some good performances, from an impressive cast - De Niro's performance is as good as you might hope or expect from him - and the film's ending is certainly memorable.

"Great characters, but no message","Goodfellas is a joy to watch. Joe Pesci is in his comfort zone playing a tetchy little New York Mafiosa hard man. De Niro almost takes a backseat to Pesci. Liotta, as raconteur, delivers the story pitch perfect.So why only 5 out of 10 (""bing a bang"")?The characterisations are marvellous but the message is an empty bag. The message is merely that ""might is right"" and life is short. The bigger you are, the more friends you have, the more weight you can throw around. Well, we know that. We knew that when a nuke was dropped on Hiroshima.There is no sincere message from the movie. There are plenty of lovable characters but nothing else to feed us. You get more, much more, from Allen's Broadway Danny Rose. From the Godfather you learn about the organisation of the underworld.However, they say movies are more about character than plot. Maybe that applies to the message too. It's good. It's fun. But you don't learn anything from it other than a few syllables that every other kid at college would know.

One of Scorseses best,"From the film's opening to it's conclusion I was hooked.

Joe Pesci as the murderous Tommy DeVito absolutely steals the show. It is worth the price of the DVD just to see this talented and versatile performer in action.

I'm the first to admit that Gangster films are not really my favourite!,"Scorcese's masterpiece, that's probably the best way to describe it; he takes us on a journey through Henry Hill's (Ray Liotta's) life, from boy to man, as he climbs through the ranks of the mobster scene, and Ray Liotta gives the performance of his life. Supported by great characters portrayed perfectly by Robert De Niro, Lorraine Bracco and the star of the piece Joe Pesci; this movie simply overflows with style, talent and guts.It's incredibly violent and it's brimming with vulgar language, but every bit of it is warranted as a piece of the picture.

Oliver Stone did it with BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY , HEAVEN AND EARTH and NATURAL BORN KILLERS , Francis Ford Coppola did it with his version of DRACULA and Scorsese would continue the style with CAPE FEAR and CASINO . Scorsese directs in this style with just the right amount of excess so the movie doesn`t suffer from being overdirected in the way CASINO was ( CASINO is basically an overlong , inferior remake of this film ) while the script by Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi is just about the right length and - Unlike CASINO - is beautifully paced and allows the audience to make up their own mind on Henry Hill who only seems to be an innocent bystander throughout events - Yeah rightWarner Bros are rightly remembered for their classic gangster flicks of the 30s and 40s .

"Pretty good, but overrated","Goodfellas is about a journey of an outsider who makes it good in the world of Italian mafia, and befriends two mobs for the remainder of his career. Much like Forrest Gump, its a story being told largely through one person' point of view. I conclude at the end that although the movie was exteremely enjoyable, its a bit overrated and it did not bear any lasting images in my psyche. There isn't a single aspect that strikes me as memorable or powerful. Thus it irritates me to no end that Goodfellas is constantly being compared to The Godfather, because I couldn't disagree more. What makes The Godfather so good is that its not really about gangsters running a business, but a deep look on family relationships and how their respective roles and personalities contribute to the family's successes and downfall. Goodfellas is only about three men working together, having the time of their lives, and occasionally punching and kicking their way through obstacles before things starts to fall apart at the end - nothing is out of the ordinary. The only message I get from the story is that becoming a gangster gives you power, but you must pay for that power dearly in exchange for absolute loyalty. Problem is, I've heard of this countless of times already.Goodfellas has a great cast (especially Pesci), nicely paced storyline and unfortunately an average soundtrack trying hard to ""capture"" the feel of the period. I like it and its really entertaining, but at the same time its an utterly forgettable gangster movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
my favorite film,"""I'm an average nobody...I get to live the rest of my life like a shnook."" So says Henry Hill, in one of the truly amazing denouements in film history. Here's a man who could've been easily killed off- at first by his wife, then by his own crew- and evaded it by sneaking out the 'easy' route. Yet Hill hasn't changed. He'll always complain about not having the good life anymore. The wrap-up makes totally clear what this saga is: the American dream realized as a given, and in the form of a corrupted mind-set.Goodfellas is the ""if-you-put-a-gun-to-my-head"" favorite movie for me, and by that token appropriate as there are many a gun pointed at a head during the film, and sometimes with a big result (the most shocking when I first saw it, and still brutal on a big screen, is seeing Sam Jackson's brains splattered all across the room like it's some ritualistic slaughter). It's true bravura storytelling, without a single shot or moment that needs to be excised or missed. To say it's a 'perfect' movie might be overstating it; what is 'perfect', after all? Scorsese does strive for- and arguably succeeds- a kind of perfection in balancing comedy and drama, like a tightrope walker going above a bed of hot coals with a rambunctious Pesci threatening with scissors like the Oklahoma Kid.You're almost afraid to laugh, and a good many times (especially if you've seen the film dozens of times like myself) you almost feel apart of the group of guys laughing about stuff that *shouldn't* be funny. But then there's what could be the greatest shot of the film, where we see a first-person of all the small-time hoods introducing themselves (""what's up guy?"" ""I'm gonna get the papers, get the papers""), where it's like we as the audience are let into the clubhouse, following them along into the back-room as they unload coats...wait, he needed suits, not coats.It's endlessly watchable as a kind of raucous, dangerous pop entertainment, and it feels as though it's gone by in much briefer time than has actually passed in 146 minutes. Maybe as part of a subjective thing I can kind of relate to many of the characters, not so much because of what they do in their criminal deeds or Hill's mistress or feeding people to lions and whatnot, but the little ticks of behavior (a little note like when Hill rushes out of his coked-up girlfriend's apartment, laughing maniacally, is like any given day with my brother).But a personal connection can only be so much to recommend this motion picture like no other. As one of the benchmarks of cinema of my generation it's got everything that many somewhat-to-big-time-sophisticated moviegoers look for: over-done classic scenes (""Am I a clown"" is the ""You're talking' to me"" of the movie, and probably not even as great until the ""last week this prick asked me to Christen his kid"" line), iconoclastic techniques with the camera and editing (everything from the freeze frames to the music and narration to the shots that have the intensity of coke or full on rage and adrenaline in beating a guy's face in with a gun), and performances that should be considered essential to see for anyone becoming an actor years and years from now.If there was ever an American film that could absorb, entertain, enthrall, and interest me on all fronts of style and substance as much as Goodfellas does on every viewing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"Great Movie, But Pretty Overrated.","I did enjoy this film, but I think it gets a little too much praise. The Godfather movies are far superior. This was innovative, but it ranks too high in all lists.Goodfellas is based on the memoir ""Wiseguy"" about Henry Hill's life as a gangster. Ray Liotta plays Hill and gives are star-making performance. Robert De Niro plays Jimmy The Gent and Joe Pesci earns a well-deserved Oscar as Tommy DeVito. Hill grew up in urban New York and wanted to be a mobster his whole life. Only, he wasn't cut out. Tommy and Jimmy were his best friends and extremely brutal. There was reluctancy sometimes in Henry. He marries Karen (Bracco) and their family life is well-documented. As Henry becomes more like the other thugs, bis life crumbles and surrenders to the witness protection program. I thought that the story was great as it cover major parts in Hill's life and some infamous crimes in American history. Scorsese also recreates some bits from the book that come out better in the movie. For example, he adds lots to the scene with Spider.I'm not saying this is the best mob movie ever like Roger Ebert said and I'm not saying it sucked. It will never reach The Godfather heights. Although the editing and film techniques were top- notch, it was not enough. One thing I didn't like was that it practically glorified being a mobster. There's so much loyalty and it makes it out to be fun. Being a gangster is not fun. Sure it's good that everybody is treated better, but they do horrible things that puts everybody in danger. Goodfellas does show that the mafia can be bad, but there's so many circumstances surrounding them that can be learned from.Another thing I didn't like was the music. The music was too loud and too good. Great music such as the Rolling Stones and Bobby Darin were playing. They proved to be distracting and did not fit well with some bit. Why not just use regular background music instead of hit songs that are overpowering?Then there's the flow and story. As I mentioned above, the story is good but does not come across to its potential. Some of the scenes go great by themselves but not all work well as a whole. They jump around too much without giving leads in or out. It just goes from thing-to- thing-to-thing-thing over the course of minutes, plus there's the distracting music. I don't mind 146 minutes, but it seems like 5 hours was condensed in half its time. Some parts could have been cut out and replaced with more flows and better plot development.Goodfellas is a brilliant flick, but not one of the best.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

"In a world that's powered by violence, on the streets where the violent have power, a new generation carries on an old tradition.","Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas is without question one of the finest gangster movies ever made, a benchmark even. It's that rare occasion for a genre film of this type where everything artistically comes together as one. Direction, script, editing, photography, driving soundtrack and crucially an ensemble cast firing on all cylinders. It's grade ""A"" film making that marked a return to form for Scorsese whilst simultaneously showing the director at the summit of his directing abilities.The story itself, based on Nicholas Pileggi's non-fiction book Wiseguy, pulls absolutely no punches in its stark realisation of the Mafia lifestyle. It's often brutal, yet funny, unflinching yet stylish, but ultimately from first frame to last it holds the attention, toying with all the human emotions during the journey, tingling the senses of those who were by 1990 fed up of popcorn movie fodder.It's not romanticism here, if anything it's a debunking of the Mafia myth, but even as the blood flows and the dialogue crackles with electricity, it always remains icy cool, brought to us by a man who had is eyes and ears open while growing up in Queens, New York in the 40s and 50s.

Brilliant,"Brilliant. Up there with the Godfather, Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs as far as gangster movies goes. You can see the influence on Tarantino, and on David Chase's making of The Sopranos (down to using some of the minor actors from Goodfellas in major roles in The Sopranos!).Great script, based on a true story. Scorsese doesn't put a foot wrong in his direction (not that he ever does!).Acting is superb. Ray Liotta, in one of his earliest roles, is very convincing in the lead role. Joe Pesci deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his intense performance, as did Lorraine Bracco deserve her Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination. Despite getting top billing, Robert De Niro doesn't have the most screen time, but doesn't seem to mind, giving his usual solid performance.A great movie.

A genius masterpiece.,"Movies don't get any better then this!The problem with gangster movies is that it always will be compared to the brilliant ""Godfather"" movies. Often when you do that you come to the conclusion that it's a very bad movie, however ""Goodfellas"" doesn't suffer from this curse. It's just as genius and at some points even better as the ""Godfather"" movies.That it's based on true events also makes the movie interesting to watch. Rarely has the live of a gangster been portrayed so wonderfully and interesting. The story is told in a wonderful way without getting boring for a single second. Who didn't wanted to be a gangster for a day after seeing this movie ???Next to the story there are three other truly great things about the movie: The cast, the characters and the dialogue. The cast is full with famous actor that all have been cast perfectly. Joe Pesci of course truly steals the show and it's no wonder he won a Oscar for his role. The famous ""You think I'm funny?"" scene with him is brilliant and amuses me every time, it truly is one of the best scene's of all time. A real classic! But let's not forget Ray Liotta and Robert De Niro who also give an amazing performance. Same goes for Catherine Scorsese as Joe Pesci's character Tommy's mother. She plays really natural and lot of fun scene's with great dialogue are the result. The wonderful stereotype gangster characters also add to this movie. How can you not like characters such as Frankie Carbone, Edward Stacks, Johnny two times, Morrie or Vinnie who puts too much tomatoes in the sauce. The movie is full with sharp and sometimes cruel but funny dialogue. All this things combined makes this a classic and magnificent movie, a movie that you MUST have at least seen once in your lifetime.The movie is full with many great long scene's. Some of the longest I have ever seen. Most of those long scene's are the highlight of the movie. Great directing from Martin Scorsese!Although it's a quite heavy movie it actually is also for some reason a fun movie to watch over and over again without getting ever boring.Nothing short of brilliant!

The Worst Movie I've Ever Seen.,"Unlike other movies Goodfellas is just not a very good movie. The story line didn't make any sense and so did the characters, like really whose called Tommy Devito, Danny Devitos brother? I've honestly watched this movie long and hard and realized that this movie isn't all that funny either. Comedy movies should be funny and this movie just didn't cut it. I highly recommend that if your at the video store anytime soon and your picking a movie do not pick this one because it is fake, unfunny and lame. Joe Pesci was boring and looked old and had absolutely no screen presence. I watch lots of movies and i now know that this is a movie that shouldn't and must not be watched by any living human being who has a brain. Robert De Niro looks fat and uninteresting. Ray Liotta looks like a store robbing punk and Pesci and looks like some fat old guy who bring me my paper in the morning. My favorite part of the movie was when it was over. This has got to be on my top 10 worst movies. That guy from See Spot Run was in the movie but he just played some boring overweight guy who i didn't care for. The guns looked like something you could buy from the $2 shop and the blood looked like tomato sauce. George Lucas should have directed this movie, unlike this movie his Star Wars series especially the last 3 (the most recent) were examples of his directing excellence which made him billions of dollars.

You really are a funny guy!,"IMDb Top 250: 15 Goodfellas is one of the best films ever. It's dramatic, charming, crazy and even a bit funny. Chronicling the rise and fall of wiseguy Henry Hill from the 50's to the 80's, Goodfellas is the best look at mob life... after the Godfather. This is Scorcese's best work that I have seen.The plot can be summarized very easily: Henry Hill wants to be a gangster, and when he becomes one he lives the life, good and bad. A biography like this could be shown in an average way, but it has the Scorcese touch. The presentation of Goodfellas is, in my opinion the most interesting and engaging in film. Period music plays throughout, Hill and Karen narrate with charm, and the pacing is perfect. Goodfellas doesn't have a dull moment.The characters are top-notch cinema, interesting and flawed. Hill, our anti-hero, is a charming Irish-Italian nobody who becomes a somebody. He looks cool, talks cool, and acts cool, until he gets in over his head with products and problems. Jimmy Conwa is the high roller, stuffing everyone's pockets with money, playing it cool until his neck is on the line. And Tommy, dear volatile Tommy, whose voice and actions steal the show, is an Italian fireball who is unpredictable. All expertly acted, these are the guys you wish you could be. Karen is also well-acted, from innocence to involvement. The entire cast of Goodfellas are personalities.This film has its share of incredible cinematic moments. From the pistol-whipping to the montage of deaths, every scene is crafted with care. Two in particular have stood above the rest though: the famous ""How am I funny?"" speech, a highlight of the rapid-fire dialogue, and the long shoot, showing Henry and Karen's date from a single perspective. Genius directing.The mood is wonderful, helped profusely by the music. Starting with oldies to show the golden age of gangsters, the music progresses in the same direction as the plot. It's unbelievable. When you hear songs from the movie, you think of Goodfellas. I hated 'Sunshine of Your Love' until Goodfellas, and when I hear it now I think of Jimmy Conway, smoking his cigarette, thinking, as the camera slowly zooms in.A classic, Goodfellas has inspired countless films even to this day. Every part of this crime masterpiece is top- notch. If you like movies, you have to see this. 9.7/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

One of Scorcese's Masterpieces,"'Goodfellas' is right up there with the best of Martin Scorcese. I recently hauled this out for a re-viewing and I was surprised at how totally up to date it felt. How relevant the plot was, how topical the story.And for a mafia movie of that era, how the women were brought front and centre and given a narrative voice - Karen Hill (played by Lorraine Bracco), the wife of the protagonist, Henry Hill (played by a riveting Ray Liotta) both get to tell their stories.The movie is based on a true story and the cast are awesome. At this later viewing I was particularly interested to see many of ""The Sopranos"" cast, here making their debuts in a similar crime-family drama.The movie is astounding in that it brings complexity, a riveting script, brilliant relevant music (with actual stars performing their hits) and mind boggling tracking shots, the most difficult of all movie sequencing. Scorcese, or his ensemble, do not flinch from the complexity of this and afterwards, one wonders at how many takes were involved.We are drawn into the intimate life of a crime family, the gradual desensitizing to the horror of the life, driven by material greed at any cost, including the callous snuffing of lives.The large ensemble cast (both known and unknown and including both of Scorcese's parents in brilliant sidebits), the cinematography, editing and dialogue are all masterful.De Niro is at his charming best,Joe Pesci captivates as a psychotic, insecure 'made' man Lorraine Bracco is masterful in a fully developed role, Ray Liotta is marvellous in the way he depicts the reality of the hoodlum life, the juxta-positioning of sauce making against the back drop of victim burials. Paul Sorvino, Michael Imperioli, Debi Mazar, Samuel L. Jackson, Illeana Douglas and Kevin Corrigan all add to the over all engrossing engagement of the film.8 out of 10.

Overrated But Amazing,"I had heard many times that
""The Godfather is how gangsters want to be seen. Goodfellas is how they actually are.""
That's not true. At least, from my limited knowledge of the families. Goodfellas heavily glamorizes the criminal lifestyle especially in the first one and a half hours. It literally made me feel like I wanted to be a gangster. It is not a good portrayal of the dirty criminal life.Maybe the final hour does an OK job at making us hate the selfish protagonist but I never felt any fire towards him. I was merely indifferent. It was melancholy but I never felt bad that his life was falling apart because of his choice.Onto the good stuff! It is very funny especially compared to the Godfather where I didn't laugh once. Even at Clemenza. It is fairly fast paced and was just enough to keep me hooked at the whole thing.

"Goodfellas is a very good, if not great, Martin Scorsese picture","While I had previously seen this Martin Scorsese picture before, it was on network television which meant I didn't hear the profanity and the violent scenes were trimmed. Despite that, I remember enjoying the movie very much. Now that I've seen it uncensored and on HD DVD, it doesn't impress me as much as before perhaps because in jumping several years in various segments, you half wonder what happened during those in-between times. Still, Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Larraine Bracco impress with their performances with Paul Sorvino lending gravity with his appearances throughout and nice cameos by up-and-coming newcomers like Illeana Douglas, Debi Mazar, Samuel L. Jackson, and Michael Imperioli. Also amusing were cameos by the director's parents, Catherine and Charles, especially Catherine's as Pesci's mother. Pesci may be the most impressive of the bunch in his Oscar-winning role as Tommy who turns from highly amused to very angry at a dime. Perhaps not one for the mainstream crowd who wants at least one likable character to identify with but a mostly compelling account of the true story of what mob life really was like for someone who lived through it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Too violent.  And Joe Pesci wasn't funny enough.,"I was hoping Joe Pesci would be more like in his comedy movies.  There were some great looking cars and great songs early in the movie, but other than that there wasn't much to make this movie appealing.  I only watched it because of Pesci and the movie's many honors or at least nominations for them.  Paul Sorvino did a good acting job.  But the people in this movie were not very nice at all.

Goodfellas -  A Very slow paced film that has not aged well.,"Goodfellas is based on a book which in turn is based on a real life story of Henry Hill, a person who always wanted to be a mobster and this film tells his story about he went from being a criminal to finally turning into a rat and leaving his whole mafia life behind.I think the overall storyline is very good, it is just the way it is told, too many filler scenes that are extremely, slow, boring and do nothing for the overall plot. In particular the Heist sequence was done so terribly, they introduce members of the heist and minutes later the heist ended and members started spending money, moments later they all end up dead. This whole angle was rushed and so poorly handled. . The love story between Henry and Karen was also slow and took too long to develop and the affair angle was so fast you blinked you misses it. When Henry was arrested the second time, they handled it with a series of jumbled up scenes, that could have been handled in half the time.Add to that the constant and annoying narration. Scorsose likes that style of storytelling, the one with narration but it is way too much here, and occasionally they would pause certain scenes and Liotta would narrate which breaks the flow of the movie, many scenes are events are explained with narration.Ray Liotta is decent in his protagonist but the other two protagonists De Niro and Joe Pesci. Pesci is fantastic and extremely charismatic as Tommy, his scenes are fun to watch and whenever he is on the screen he demands your attention, his lines are also pretty funny. De Niro does great with the amount of screen time he gets but he does not get a lot of it and allow his character to properly develop from a rationale person to a paranoid man who thinks everybody is going to get him arrested. Liotta was not bad he gave a decent performance but there are others who could have done better in his role, he is really good in some scenes, but in emotional scenes and even the funny scenes his poor acting clearly shows, his laugh is terrible and looks fake. Some great sequences regardless. The Tommy death scene and him killing a made man was one of the interesting parts.Overall I don't see what is so special about Goodfellas, it is an average movie, which had a great story with potential but was told in a very average and slow manner, the narrative had tons of filler and was not handled well, the main protagonist was decent at best, leaving the other two main actors to make the most of it and carry the film and steal the show. It is definitely no Godfather.Overall: 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Unparalled Gangster movie,"No matter how many times you watch it, Goodfellas is one of those movies which you just never grow out of. Arguably the best gangster film of the decade (but I think of all time). Martin Scorsese is able to generate just about every kind of tone a film could have; humorous, touching, depressing, grim. This is superbly written and acted, and ten times more down-to-Earth and involving than the Godfather. If there is anyone out there who hasn't seen Goodfellas.....see it.The first thing we see on screen are the words 'The following is based on a true story' or something like that. In the twenty first century, those words are the hottest marketing gig going. Goodfellas was before those days. Next we meet Henry Hill, who became a gangster at grade school age, and went on to become hot stuff. He helped pull off the famous Lufthansa heist, but did he and his buddies get away with it?Goodfellas is able to cover about three and a half decades in two hours, without felling too slow or too fast. The story, is direct and detailed, and allows the viewer to become 'one of the boys'. Goodfellas feels like a party almost, with an occasional ballroom brawl here and there.I'm assuming because of its Oscar snub, that the film wasn't very popular when it was released, but of course brilliance doesn't come right away. It took years for the world to recognize just how groundbreaking Citizen Kane was. No movie is perfect, but Goodfellas is pretty close.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Keep it stacked or get whacked. Your choice.,"Scorsese's Goodfellas is an incorruptible masterpiece with morals, wit, black humor, and cringe-inducing material, some of which the most graphic and brutal the man himself has ever filmed. It portrays the life of organized crime over the course of three decades, showing the central character who grew up idolizing the mob before almost despising it towards the end of the film. The result is a slick, unmatchable look at the way mobsters spoke, operated, and functioned from the fifties to the eighties and is one of the most powerful pictures for not only Scorsese, but for film itself in general.The story revolves around Irish-Italian Henry Hill (Liotta) who, ever since he was a youngster, looked up to the mob in his home of New York City. He says he wanted to be a gangster more than the president, because the gangsters had an untold amount of respect and dignity. The job revolves around persistency, bravery, emotionless devotion where one bad choice could ruin every good one you ever made in your life.Hill is taken under the wing of mob boss Paulie Cicero (Sorvino) and his loyal team of Jimmy Conway (De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Pesci). Conway operates as sort of an everyman mobster who is constantly watching his back, yet at times seems like he will crumble under all the pressure. While Tommy, on the other hand, is animalistic, unapologetic, and simply shameless, reacting impulsively on violence if someone looks at him the wrong way. Pesci's role as Tommy DeVito earned him an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, quite possibly the most violent character to ever win. While Hill is working for Cicero at a young age he learns two of the most important life lessons early on in his career; ""Never rat on your friends, and always keep your mouth shut."" This begins Hill's long, relentless career as a mobster, which involves stealing, plotting, scheming, and constant commitment to the job. He gets married at a young age, to the heart-stopping beauty Karen (Bracco), a Jewish girl, much to the dismay of her mother. Karen falls for Hill's bravery, leadership, protection, and smarts early on, but realizes that once you married a mobster, you're now married to the job as well. That makes you a mob-wife; a position you can't refuse.Throughout the film, we see how Hill manages his mobster duties and his overall position. This is where the very Scorsese aspect comes into play. If you've been exposed to enough of the genius director, you'll know what he does best; the stories of people who rise and fall, or endured a reasonable amount of glory in a specific point in their life. In Casino, it showed a man named Sam ""Aces"" Rothstein, played by De Niro as well, struggle to run a Vegas casino with a number of roadside distractions. He was at the height of his game once, but a few faulty decisions on his part ran him straight into the ground. In The Aviator, one of Scorsese's more recent films, we meet the unsung filmmaker and aviation expert Howard Hughes, portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio. There, we dissect Hughes' glory years from when he directed the most expensive film of all time, to when he plummeted into a sea of nothing, becoming a sheltered germaphobe for a good remainder of his life. In Goodfellas, we see how a man can go from being a big shot to a self-indulgent, paranoid man consumed alive by his own greed, disrespect, and betrayal.Another recurring element, in pretty much every film by Scorsese, is we can see Scorsese's undeniable fascination with the material. We understand why he took the project just by the way he shot the film. We can see he takes a stern liking to the mob lifestyle, and sometimes, we get the faint impression he admires them. On the surface, and if we were to make a broad generalization, untold riches, cute Italian women, different ones every night, close friends, and fancy clubs and restaurants sounds divine to me. But they don't tell you that you must sleep with one eye open, and constantly avoid getting whacked. That part they left out of the manual.The performances, like in any film by the master, are simply divine - not a single one off pitch or even average. One performance that has gone overlooked is Lorraine Bracco. She is in the same position actress Sharon Stone would find herself in when playing Ginger in Casino, five years later. Bracco is in the position to overact, but never does. She is constantly improving as time goes on, and handles her climatic instances well. Not to mention, the male performances by De Niro, Liotta, Pesci, and Sorvino are all absolutely wonderful, always hitting the correct note in every place.Goodfellas is an American classic. Not a modern classic; a regular ol' classic. It is an enriching movie, with stylish writing (by Scorsese himself and Nicolas Pileggi, who wrote the novel the film is based on, Wiseguy), inevitably stellar performances, and an unforgettable score and setting that might leave you breathless at some points. The hardest part in any Scorsese film is picking a favorite scene. I think I've found one. It involves one the best jump scenes in any film I've seen recently. Along with evoking regret, naive instincts, and betrayal. It involves Joe Pesci. I will not say more.Starring: Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Paul Sorvino, and Lorraine Bracco.

GOODFELLAS make a memorable Gangster movie,"If there is a movie with ""goodfellas"" like De Niro and Pesci directed by Scorsese then you shouldn't miss out. This with the Godfather movie were two best gangster movies of all times and they both are based on Sicilian-Americans. The iconic Italinan-kind-of-narrative-screenplay does the trick for Scorsese again. The characters Jimmy, Henry,Tommy and Paulie are memorable and defined perfectly by the director. Joe Pesci was the best among in this movie as he is funny and short-tempered at the same time and no wonder academy recognized his performance.

Paul Sorvino takes the day,"Gangster movies are really about power. We watch movies of this genre because they inspire us to take control. We want to take and express power to those around us effortlessly. Otherwise, what's the point of watching films in this genre?For a film with talented actors such as this, it can be difficult to really see how the characters will play their roles and convince viewers who's really in charge. I like how the cast display their power. However, Paul Cicero takes the crown.Who's really powerful in the clique? I watched this film just for that. I like the scene where Paul Sorvino (Paul Cicero's character) controls the crew without uttering a single word. He gets in the room and everyone in the clique keeps quiet. Now, that's power right there.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Major Disappointment,"The movie is an insight into mafia life. It shows you the different characters a gangster could be rather than the ""so cool"" impression you can get from a film like ""Analyze This"".The performances are all excellent, but the movie lacks a solid plot - there is no story to follow or anything to want you want to continue watching. I basically kept watching to see if anything cool would happen last minute or something.Not impressive at all, I am actually surprised it was on the list.

Possibly my favorite?,"Alright this is going to be a long review because i have so much to say about this film. First off this one of the or the best mafia film ever made. It stars a bang up cast of world class actors, ray liotta, joe pesci, robert deniro, paul sorvino and the list goes on and on. It was written and dircted by Martin Scorscese who is considered by many to be the best film maker of all time.This movie follows the true story of Henry Hill (Liotta) a young man who started working for the mob when he was just a teenager. The movie gives a very detailed view of his life and all the trouble he faced through out it.This is easily Ray Liottas finest hour and this movie is the reason he even got into Hollywood. Also it has a bang up performances from Robert deniro and joe pesci. Mob movies would not be the same without those two in them. This movie all comes together perfectly made possible by the fantastic writing of Scorsese and the immaculate acting of all those involved.

"An excellent story, a better film","Goodfellas, although somewhat exaggerated in a few situations, follows pretty closely, the life and uncertain times of the half Irish half Italian wannabe wise-guy, Henry Hill.

All in all, this depiction of the wise-guy lifestyle, along with the actions taken by these men in order to carry on with this lifestyle, is done in a way that has oft been imitated but never duplicated.

Scorsese worked his magic on the story of Henry Hill, as being a 16 year old by i have become fascinated with. He's an Itlaian-Irish gangster and he produced in my opinion one of the best films ever made. De Niro, Liotta and Pesci shine in the film but i think its Lorraine Bracco who plays Karen who absolutely steals the show, playing the Jewish girl from a quiet neighbourhood, thrown into the world of Cocaine dealing, murders and violence. Its undoubtedly one of my favourite films and I'm sure it will be for a long time.

The note-perfect performances, the technical mastery, the never-aging stylishness, cinematography, and editing; the effortlessly perfect needle drops.

The film has wonderful camera shots, great back story, and a film that I study as a student. This is a must watch film, and something that I think you can watch over and over again.

Goodfellas,"Goodfellas was a great movie and one of the most popular gangster movies of all time. Being that its based on a true story, it shows the ups and downs of life in the Italian mafia. The film makes great use of cinematography such as with the camera work. The musical selection also goes well with the corresponding scenes. The director, Martin Scorsese, use great directing techniques to get the best out of his actors and actresses. The character development is is also set up really well taking you through the best of times in the mafia and the worst of times. The script probably stands out the most, being that the movie was based off of a book. So all the stories are true and all his fellow gangsters were actually based off of real life characters. The acting might have been some of the best that I had seen in a gangster film with Ray Liotta playing the main character perfectly but the actor whose role stood out the most was Joe Pesci. He even went on to win an Oscar for best supporting actor for that role. There were few objections to the movie but many people felt that the language used was too vulgar. I think it just better help explain just the type of lifestyle that these guys were living. Some also believed that the movie should have received an NC-17 rating but it was barely able to squeak by with a R rating. Being a huge fan of the film I would definitely have to recommend it to whoever likes gangster genres.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

a virtual handbook into the life of the mob in its golden age.,"Well - here it goes.. In my area everyone ""loves"" the mob way of life.. Everyone loves ""The Sopranos"" and I also find it enjoyable to watch a great mob movie and then imagine for a minute that Im a part of it.. For most of my life there has been only one movie to even speak of when it came to this subject - The Godfather Epic. For those of you not familiar with it it was the Godfather Parts I and II edited in chronological order.. I've seen it several times and to this day my Dad still thinks that this is the best mob story ever told..But With all due respect..I just watched Goodfellas for the 12th time and - There is no doubt in my mind that Goodfellas is the best mob movie ever made..The story starts off during the Golden Age of Organizied Crime 1955 Brooklyn NY. A young Henry Hill is intrigued by the mob way of life - and let's be honest - why not !?.. They have it all - respect, wealth, and power.. Everything about the movie at this point is made to ""romance"" you about the era.. The music, the cinematography, work so well together..its quite rare that a film can make you actually ""feel"" a part of it.. Goodfellas succeeds at this.. We meet all sorts of characters who add to the environment. Henry as he learns the ropes also decribes to the viewer how it works.. And just about the time your ready to stand-up and declare you wanna be a ""wiseguy"" When things are going so good -Goodfellas smacks you right in the face and says - Whaddasamatta with you..The deceit, the lying, the overall evil that consumes these people is staggering.. The movie shows that in the mob there is no love, no loyality, no care - even amonst themselves.. The biggest mistake the mob made was to include drugs into its ""business"".Goodfellas exceeds the Godfather because of the feeling of inclusion you feel when watching it, it surrounds you and makes you feel like a part of the film.. I felt it's direction, and cinematography, and editing style are second to none.. This is Scorese and DeNiro's best film together..Raging Bull was great too but Casino was pale over this one -  Liotta was wonderful although he hasnt done much since.. and Pesci's best is My Cousin Vinny but his ""Tommy"" is very good - deserving of the Oscar that year - even though you wouldnt want to know him.If your a fan of mob storys in general see if you can spot two Sopranos guys in the movie !

Nothing here is romanticized. They may have had a lot of perks, made a lot of money, but at what cost? That is ultimately the theme that is explored in ""Goodfellas""However it is most definitely NOT for everyone. There is no justice, no happy ending, sometimes no rhyme of reason for the crimes that are committed, except that it's just the way of life. The people in the movie are not sympathetic, you won't like them. You won't like their friends. You won't like their enemies. For some people that can be frustrating, myself included. It's disturbing; some of the murders in this movie made me downright angry.

"The Myth of ""The Greatest Film of All Time"" Brought to Glorious Life","If you hate mob movies, or hate Scorsese, then you probably won't be able to sit through this. But for the rest of us out there, this is arguably one of the best films of the 1990's, possibly one of the best of all time, and without a doubt one of the most influential films of the past twenty years. Every mob movie/underworld saga/generational tale/crime thriller from ""Pulp Fiction"" to ""Boogie Nights"" to ""Blow"" (which played like the TV movie version of a great Scorsese flick) to TV's ""The Sopranos"" owes a debt to this film. Scorsese was at the top of his game here, and what makes this film stand tall above all other movies of this ilk (including Scorsese's own ""Casino""--a great film in its own right) is that there is an overwhelming visceral charge to the film that makes it all seem so enjoyable despite the onslaught of blood, foul language, and unsavory activities. You are made to believe that these gangsters were having the time of their lives. So too were Scorsese and pals in making the film. And lastly, so too are we the audience in watching it all. Everything came together in this film so perfectly the viewer is left feeling oddly giddy amongst all the true life bloodshed. This sense of ""fun"" is the one thing that his recent ""Gangs of New York"" was missing, and may be what keeps that film from being ranked as one of the all time greats.As for the acting, Pesci is all at once hilarious and scary. De Niro is at his best. And Liotta gives a career defining performance (only in the recent ""Narc"" has he been able to recapture some of this magic).As for some of the finer details, I dare you to find a movie that makes better use of popular music or Steady-cam shots. The cinematography, editing, set designs and costumes (that traverse the varied stylings of the 1950's , 60's, 70's and early 80's) are all pitch perfect. Is there a better scene than when Liotta takes Lorraine Braco to the Copacabana for the first time and introduces her to the perks of gangster life while ""And Then he Kissed Me"" plays on the soundtrack? Will you ever be able to listen to ""Layla"" without thinking about mob hits and a frozen body in a meat truck?All these things, a communion with the audience (here we share Scorsese's joy both in making a film and in our watching it), top-notch production values, great performances, and a lasting influence on later films are the earmarks of a great movie, the pinnacle of a great director's career, and one of the greatest films of all time. ""Goodfellas"" may never reach the mythical status ""The Godfather"" saga did, but as great films like this are becoming few and far in between, it makes you believe in the myth of the ""greatest film of all time.""

One of the greatest films of all time!,"If you have not seen ""GoodFellas"" yet, then my question for you is this: Why? ""GoodFellas,"" in addition to being the most accurate movie about life in the mafia, is also one of the greatest films of all time! The film is the story of the rise and fall of real-life gangster Henry Hill (played very well by Ray Liotta), his marriage to Karen Hill (Lorraine Bracco), and his friendship to fellow mobsters Jimmy Conaway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy De Vito (Joe Pesci, in his Oscar-winning role), as well as friendship to mob boss Paulie Sicero (Paul Sorvino). The film is full of great performances, all lead by the one, the only, Martin Scorsese, who is at the tip top of his game in this film. It's entertaining, brilliant, and, above all, a masterpiece.

Goodfellas has to be Martin Scorsese's best film along with Taxi Driver!,"Martin Scorsese is just quite simply one of the influenced film-makers in the business. All his films are done with style and character. ""Goodfellas"" (1990) is a film which felt so realistic (it's based on a true story) and the way it was put together just looked impossible (with the editing,the dialog voice-overs, the angles, the setting, etc...) but that's what film-making is all about: making the impossible possible on the big screen and Scorsese did that and he succeeded. I can now see where Quentin Tarantino came from with his influences which I find fascinating. Goodfellas, in my opinion is better than the Godfather films and any other rip-offs. I just don't understand why this film didn't win best film of 1990 (""Dances with wolves"", what were they thinking!). It was because of the violence and the ironic thing is that's what the film's about: a life of violence in the mafia and all the film is doing is trying to show how violence is in reality (which is very important). Goodfellas is by far the greatest gangster film ever made in a long time and it's martin scorsese's best film along with 1976's Taxi Driver (the film that showed how an individual can be just be a complete nutter). Another great film which has won its place in my 100 greatest films of all time. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
One word: Masterpiece,"This is a perfect movie.It all came together for Scorsese, a true magician of cinema.After brilliant films such as Taxi Driver and Raging Bull, the acting performances, soundtrack, suspense, comedy, violence, setting, were all interwoven to a tee.Liotta must deserve credit, carrying the film the whole way. But there were also mentionable acting performances from his wife (Karen), Mori, and Pauli Cicero.De Niro in my opinion is one of the greatest actors in cinematic history, and Joe Pesci you can't go wrong with in any movie centered around violence/the mafia/blood/humour.10/10 A must watch for ANYONE.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

My favorite gangster film,"When I was younger I couldn't decide which one of these classics is the best film about gangsters ever made. The Godfather or Goodfellas. As I grow up, though I acknowledge the Godfather to be a masterpiece, Goodfellas is definitely my favorite one. I can't find a flaw in this film no matter how hard I try. The story is powerful, exciting, emotional and thrilling. All that without being complicated and without having to remember 100 character's names and situations. The direction by Scorsese is excellent. I can't say much about it, none other than that it's one his best films. I love the narration, I love the acting, I love the film's music.

Like a Fine Wine - it gets better with age,"I have to admit, when I first watched GOODFELLAS 30 years ago, I thought it was ""good"" but not ""great"".The years and subsequent viewings of this epic masterpiece has slowly changed my mind.Directed by one of the finest Directors of all-time, GOODFELLAS is based on the real-life experience of former ""Wiseguy"" Nicholas Pileggi (from his book) and depicts mob life in New York City in the 1960's and the 1970's.Scorcese knows this world and it's looks & feels and you can sense that world while watching this movie. Whether it's the clothing, the set decorations, the vocal inflections or the music choices, Scorcese meticulously blends all of the minutiae of these eras and these people extremely effectively to draw a vivid picture of people - and gangsters - of another era.It helps tremendously that he has an ""A"" cast to inherit the characters. Robert DeNiro shows his ferocious personae as a ""force to be reckoned with"" as legendary (their word) mobster Jimmy Conway. He has a danger to him that could erupt at any time, but he also has something else - probably even more dangerous - he's smart and wily and will meticulously plan his crimes out. This makes him stand out in a world where most are acting out of impulse. Joe Pesci, rightfully, won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his take on psychopathic gangster Tommy DeVito. What struck me on this viewing of the film was how small a role in this film that Tommy is. Pesci is not on-screen all that much, but for the scenes that he is in, he is incredibly powerful. You can see that Tommy is dangerous and needs to be handled with ""kit gloves"".Scorcese took a chance by centering this film on an unknown actor on who's shoulders that this film will stand or fall - and he chose wisely - for Ray Liotta's performance as Henry Hill is fascinating to watch. He has a charisma and charm to him that draws you in, but there is also an air about him that repels you away at the same time. Scorcese cast another unknown, Lorraine Bracco as Henry's wife, Karen Hill, who is drawn towards the power and danger of Henry (and his world). Bracco was nominated for an Oscar and Liotta never came close to this level of performance for the rest of his career.Credit, therefore, must be given to the Directorial job that Scorcese put in on this film. This is his masterpiece (despite what the Oscars say). Years from now when scholars look back on his career, this (along with Raging Bull) will be the films that are shown (not THE DEPARTED - the film that he, finally, won his Oscar for).I find more and more nuance and richness to this film upon subsequent re-watches, and I drank those in on this viewing. GOODFELLAS is like a fine wine, it gets better with age.Letter Grade: A9 stars out of 10 (and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Scorsese at his best,"Goodfellas is an all around great movie. If you don't immediately love it, it'll probably grow on you soon enough. Ray Liotta, Lorraine Bracco, and Joe Pesci all give the best performances in their careers and it is arguably Martin Scorsese's best directorial effort. Sure, it's up there among his best with Taxi Driver, Mean Streets, and Raging Bull, but this one just stands out more. I think what makes Goodfellas so great is it's compilation of elements like the acting, storytelling, character development, and dialogue. My One complaint is that Robert DeNiro is not in the movie as much as you'd expect, and I was always left wanting more. But maybe that's a good thing.Goodfellas is an amazing, unforgettable film that everyone should see. If you haven't already had the pleasure of seeing it, go rent it right now.

One of the Ultimate Mobster Movies,"When Martin Scorsese is at his best, no one can do a gangster movie like him, and ""Goodfellas"" is him at his best.Mind you, I don't think it's his best film (for me, that title belongs to ""Taxi Driver""), but it's a hugely entertaining and rollicking film that spends its first half making the world of mobsters look like an enticing fantasy and its second half making it look like a living hell. There are fierce performances from everyone, but though Joe Pesci was singled out for his outrageous depiction of the ultimate hot head, the film would not hold together without Ray Liotta's commanding performance at its center. Lorraine Bracco's performance as a naive dense wife who turns into an enraged shrew of a wife is like nails on a chalkboard, but I'm guessing she delivered exactly what was asked of her.The film features rapid fire editing and a soundtrack that won't quit, but in the hands of Scorsese, elements like this feel like more than empty stylistics.Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Great cast in a mediocre movie,"I saw a lot of mafia movies and they all are on the same mold. This one is no exception and to me, frankly, it was quite boring. Of course, it is possible that other films under this template are younger than ""Goodfellas"" and that, if I saw them chronologically, this one would be more interesting, and the others that copy it would be boring. But ""The Godfather"" was made almost twenty years before this film, so this theory does not hold water either. However, seven nominations and one won Oscar, baton in the hands of Martin Scorsese and the cast which is by no means inferior to that of ""The Godfather"" rise this achievement above a bunch of similar ones.

Goodfellas: A Masterful Gangster Epic with Unforgettable Performances and Stunning Cinematography,"""Goodfellas"" is an all-time classic that is widely regarded as one of the greatest gangster films ever made. Directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, and Joe Pesci, the movie tells the true story of Henry Hill, a small-time criminal who rises through the ranks of the Mafia. The film is a masterclass in filmmaking, with Scorsese's trademark kinetic energy and visual flair on full display. The performances are exceptional, particularly Pesci's unforgettable turn as the unhinged Tommy DeVito. The movie's fast-paced editing and iconic soundtrack make it a thrilling and immersive experience that captures the gritty reality of life in the mob. ""Goodfellas"" explores themes of loyalty, betrayal, and the corrupting influence of power, while also providing a darkly humorous commentary on the criminal underworld. It is a cinematic masterpiece that remains as thrilling and entertaining today as it was upon its release over 30 years ago.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Scorsese's Ultimate Triumph,"There was a time in my youth when I really didn't appreciate gangster movies. Maybe it was because of the way I was raised or the amount of estrogen present in my mothers womb due to birth order but I never saw the intense violence of that lifestyle as anything but a cry for help. It wasn't until watching Martin Scorsese's The Departed (2006) that my notions of true- to-life crime dramas began to change. I then went back to watch Goodfellas (1990), a film I originally saw bits and pieces of when I was twelve.Today Goodfellas remains to me a revelation. An honest portrayal of the Mafioso lifestyle told directly from the horses mouth.The movie itself takes the viewer through three decades of mob life. Our protagonist Henry becomes enamored with the lifestyle in early adolescence and is hooked with its excesses before costars Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci even appear on screen. Once they do, the trio become the focus of the film as they attempt to climb up the Lucchese family hierarchy. Ray Liotta serves as our narrator and double for real-life wiseguy Henry Hill a half Irish-Italian mobster turned informant who spilled the beans on the Lucchese crime family for the FBI and later writer Nicholas Pileggi. Pileggi would later release his book Wiseguy: Life in a Mafia Family in 1986 which is around the time director Martin Scorsese got wind of the story.The film is told through a series of episodes starting with the three protagonists driving in darkness and killing an unknown man in the trunk of their car. The film then linearly progresses through time, revisiting that gruesome scene halfway through. While the story structure diverges slightly from the traditionally linear, anticipating action, climax, resolution format, the movie keeps interest. This is to the credit of Martin Scorsese's direction as well as his habit of putting bubbly 50's and 60's pop songs over brutal acts of violence. Nicholas Pileggi should also take a bow both for the original book and countless rewrites that made Goodfellas possible. It was his authenticity that brought the characters dimension.but while the writer gives characters motivations and plot, it is the actors that really make them flesh and blood. Robert De Niro's Jimmy ""The Gent"" Conway towers in every scene he's in with equal parts suavity and malice. While De Niro provides the group credibility in the yes of the mob and audience, Joe Pesci is pure id. A trigger-happy sociopath with a red hot temper and a gun; not a combination that leads to good things in a movie of this kind. Pesci would end up winning an Oscar for his work on Goodfellas; a role that was originally offered to Al Pacino.One underrated aspect of Goodfellas is the character arch of Lorraine Bracco's role Karen Hill; Henry's wife. There are moments of the film narrated by the tragic heroine that provide the movie with a sense of perspective just as Henry's objectivity has gone off the deep end. She's an outsider who is at first overwhelmed but becomes seduced by the decadence of mob life and breaks bad. I would argue that the river runs deeper with Karen than with the dejected Henry. Henry wants the fancy cars, excessive Staten Island home and the most expensive artificial Christmas tree money can buy. But when Karen is handed a gun and told to hide it, right after a aberrant neighbor gets his faced smashed with the butt-end, she claims arousal. This is not a woman who craves simple security in the arms of the hero, she wants respect. That's why every transgression Henry or anyone makes is met with hostility. What isn't shown in the movie but detailed in the book was Karen's affair with mob capo Paul Vario while Henry was in prison; little more Lady MacBeth than Ophelia if you ask me.Of course, Goodfellas as a whole is studded with set pieces of violence and cruelty that in a lesser movie I wouldn't be impressed with. But as with good food, its not just ingredients that make the meal, its how its presented. The violence of Goodfellas is presented with a matter- of-factness and purpose that isn't gratuitous. Scorsese doesn't want you to bask in the glory of outright gore, he wants you to experience the world as the characters do, a task which he largely succeeds in.I love this movie if for no other reason than it breaks the mold and sets a gold-standard for other genre movies to inspire to. It features topnotch performances from actors and actresses at the top of their game, and it showcases the uncompromising vision and talent of one of the greatest auteurs of the late 20th century.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

This Movie Is A Drug.,"In the opening moments of GoodFellas, a movie about the tradecraft and culture of organized crime in New York, our storyteller Henry Hill says that for as long as he can remember, he always wanted to be a gangster, that it was better than being President. That he voice-overs his own life, later joined by his wife, narrating her side, is pivotal to the movie's ingenuity. Though the film refuses to judge its characters, it's not an omniscient portrayal, but a frame of reference rooted in yearning for the life. What's more, alternating dual narration causes us to see scenes in different ways. ""These were blue-collar guys,"" Hill's wife rationalizes. ""The only way they could make real extra money was to go out and cut a few corners."" Their influence was, and is, exhilarating. ""If we wanted something, we just took it,"" Henry says. ""If anyone complained twice they got hit so bad, believe me, they never complained again."" After all of his harrowing experiences, Henry, played by Ray Liotta in the stand-out performance of his career, still carps, still misses all the good times. And after literally having seen this film possibly a hundred or more times, I still watch.The screenplay is both based on Nicholas Pileggi's biography of Hill, and Scorsese's own Little Italy recollections. The early scenes showcase adolescent Henry as an errand boy for the local Brooklyn mob. A shot of him peering out his tenement window reflects Scorsese's own schoolday reminiscences of the neighborhood. So does the reverse-shot which utilizes quiet slow-motion for closeups of mobsters' shiny shoes, slick ties, greased-back hair, ostentatious rings, smoldering cigars. In a movie legendary for violence that happens by surprise, one of the most jolting kicks comes when Henry's beaten by his father for missing school. He had to ""take a few beatings"" at home owing to his teenage professional pursuit, but it was a small price. Violence is like the tempo beneath every scene. The percussion is the fruits of unwarranted benefits. Henry's accomplice Jimmy Conway emerges into his first shot with Robert De Niro's special brand of broadcasted constraint. His mannerisms say, ""Don't worry. You'll all get autographs if you're patient."" Henry's other partner is the unforgettable Tommy DeVito, in an extraordinary performance by Joe Pesci, who oversteps his influence rather than letting it imply itself.Henry's enthusiasm for his developing profession is tangible. In the movie's most talked-about shot, he takes his future wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco gives it her all) to the Copacabana. There's a line in front, but he squires her across the street, downstairs through service hallways, the kitchen area, out into the showroom right as their table's being set right in front of the stage. This uninterrupted three-minute shot is not just a cameraman's feat: It's a bold technique showing how the whole world appears to unravel readily before young Henry Hill. There's another particularly extended shot, as Henry acquaints us with his fellow gangsters. Henry leads the camera through a packed speakeasy, calling out names as the characters nod to the camera, mutter to Henry. The camera appears to track Henry, yet appears to be his POV; sometimes he's talking to them, sometimes to us. We're included in the scene. The cinematographer, Michael Ballhaus, was a central accomplice. Cultivating Scorsese's trademark form, he quite rarely lets his camera be stationary. It's so often in motion, if just slightly, making us not cold bystanders but complicit witnesses.Alongside the violence is an account of capitalistic striving. Henry and Karen come from circumstances that couldn't freely result in Cadillacs, Vegas excursions, fur coats. She rationalizes what he has to do to finance their prestige. The movie centralizes Henry's climb through the mob, then down into prison sentences and full-blown duplicity. Initially the mob looks to be an augmentation of his life, then eventually, after he begins selling drugs, there's a hemmed-in diminishing. The camera style in the earlier scenes ritualizes his network of control with all-encompassing grace. Near the end, in an intoxicatingly berserk segment huddled in one day, the form gets hectic and jerky as he hustles frenziedly around the neighborhood on family and criminal errands while a helicopter constantly feels like it's fluttering above. This is one of the most virtuoso film sequences I have ever seen.What Scorsese does that makes GoodFellas so universally adored is infect us with his exhilaration with the material. It has the breakneck propulsion of a storyteller who can't wait to see your reaction. Scorsese's camera embraces these guys, listens to their shoes clicking, beholds the tailoring of their clothes. And when they're plotting the fabled Lufthansa job, he has them whispering together in a tight three-shot that has their heads bent low and close with the rush of their own awesomeness. What a rush it is for them to steal.The film's way is to sever dialogue with brutality. We see some of cinema's most effective cries wolf, as in Pesci's legendary restaurant scene where Tommy would like to know what Henry meant when he said he was a funny guy. Other instants amplify abruptly out of the sheer mob environment: The way a mistaken drink order leads to blood. The way kidding around in a bar leads to a man being viciously brutalized. The way the violence bayonets the everyday lives of the characters is invariably enforced. Tommy, Henry and Jimmy, with a body in their trunk, stop at Tommy's mother's house to get a knife, and she insists they sit down at 3 a.m. for spaghetti. Scorsese feels so in control of his powerful talent here. It describes crime's allure for an insatiable young man who's determined from childhood beatings not to resent power, but long for it. When Henry talks to us at the beginning, it sounds like a classic Hollywood dream-come-true picture.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

A true crime masterpiece,"One of my favorite films of all time, second only to A Few Good men, this darkly comic and boldly violent gangster epic is a true masterpiece. Featuring career-best performances from Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta and Lorraine Bracco as well as a career-making one from Joe Pesci, who fully deserved his Academy Award.The film follows a 30-year period in the lives of Henry Hill (Liotta) and his association with the Italian Mafia. The script features some of the most laugh-out-loud moments ever in a serious crime drama (all the good bits are delivered with extra zing by Pesci), and also some of the most expletive-filled rants (once again, courtesy of Pesci). The violence won't be for all tastes, but it's necessary in this story, especially when the script constantly surprises you and you start realizing that you have no idea who might live and who might die or who's going to jail and who'll live happy ever after.Because as Henry soon finds out, once you're in the family, there's no way out. Special mention has to be made of Scorsese's brilliant directing, which includes some glorious unbroken tracking shots and a 60's Motown soundtrack that's to die for. A classic in every sense of the word.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Goodfellas,"""As far back as I can remember I always wanted to be a gangster.""Every single time we had to do the pointless and awkward introduction in my undergrad classes, Henry Hill's opening monologue was always my response. This achieved a couple goals for me, I avoided having to actually articulate the fact that I wanted to run for office, and I also got to see if there were any hidden cinephiles scattered around me. It never really worked; occasionally I would find another fan of the film, but never someone with a broad film taste who didn't suggest we watch Scarface as a double feature with Goodfellas. Martin Scorsese, one of the Kings of New York settled on adapting the novel by Nicholas Pileggi following the life of Henry Hill as he rose to prominence in the Brooklyn mafia. Starring Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, and Joe Pesci, Goodfellas is the work of a true auteur in top form and has remained a mafia classic 27 years after its release.Growing up in a modest home with blue collar parents, Henry Hill saw a way to make everything he had ever wanted his. Henry saw how the ""wiseguys' in his neighborhood lived, and wanted to be like them and have the freedom to go anywhere they wanted while wearing the best clothes and constantly having hundred dollar bills to flash. Henry started small as a child then a teenager, along with his friend Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) advancing in the mafia with each passing year. Learning the ins and outs, the rules and orders, the intricate details of the mafia--like only one could see from the inside, Henry had no problem paying his dues and earning his place. When Henry is really initiated and deemed worthy of meeting the higher ranks, he is introduced to Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro). Conway, Hill, and DeVito become something of a dream team executing some of the biggest robberies and hijackings the country had ever seen. Henry's life comes crashing down when he's ""pinched"" and must take the fall for a crime. While in jail, Hill enters the drug trade making more money at less of a split than he ever had before. After his jail sentence is complete, mob boss Paul Cicero (Paul Sorvino) assures Henry that he will be fine in the mafia once again. He understood that Henry had to deal in drugs to keep himself and his family afloat while in prison, but he has to give that up as Paulie isn't involved in the drug trade. Living better than he ever had before, however, meant that Hill had no intentions of leaving the drug trade behind. Staying involved in drugs and becoming an addict himself got Hill into a world of trouble and the only way he can get out is by bringing about the downfall of the two people closest to him, the two he had spent nearly his whole life with, Jimmy and Tommy.In an expert maneuver, Martin Scorsese begins in the middle of the story, then traces to the beginning through the end. The story structure of Goodfellas is one to marvel at, and certainly one that wouldn't have been so flawlessly executed without director Martin Scorsese. Goodfellas is so engaging that I can't tell you how many times I've seen it, and yet, if I walk into a room in which it is playing I will watch until the end. From the perfect execution of the introductory scenes, which are often a rather boring part in other films, to the brilliant in-depth character development, Goodfellas is a film to study for its narrative. An astute viewer is given such a complete glimpse into the men's lives that one can see where the character's failings exist that will eventually bring them down. Some of the best tracking shots in cinema history are contained within Goodfellas. The one fans of the film love to discuss are the scene in which Henry and his eventual wife are shown across the street as their car is getting parked and followed by the camera all the way in through the kitchen then through the front of the restaurant. It's a beautiful shot lasting two full minutes, and that's just one example of directorial prowess concerning tracking shots. My personal favorite occurs during the scene in which the audience is introduced to the mafia members. The camera slides down the length of the bar as we learn the names of those in the Brooklyn mafia as well as certain character traits they possess. One of my favorite parts of the film is the way its narration changes seamlessly between Henry and Karen Hill. We go from hearing Henry's voice then his wife's, then back to Henry's voice again all the while changing the point of view but the audience never misses a step and the narrative is never sloppy. Put simply, Goodfellas is a master class in filmmaking from a director who is no stranger to making classic films. Goodfellas on its own would be enough for any director to hang their hat on, but the fact that the same director was also behind Raging Bull and Taxi Driver speaks to the greatness of Martin Scorsese.I'll never get over what happened to Tommy, though.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
One of the best gangster films,"GoodFellas deserves its reputation as one of the best gangster films, and also one of the most realistic: some critics have called it a version of The Godfather without the romanticizing of the gangsters. Based on the actual autobiography of a minor player in the gang hierarchy, the film is one of Martin Scorsese's best, with several sequences of what critics have rightly called bravura film making. As expected from Scorsese, lots of language, some sex and drugs, and intense, shocking violence. But if you want a film like this, this is one you will want. In some ways the film is a trial run for the even longer and more ambitious Scorsese film Casino, which makes it interesting to see both films; personally I prefer the grittier Goodfellas. I saw it on the very good Warner Home Video Blu-Ray.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Another great Scorsese film,"Goodfellas is a great film about the underground world of organized crime. There are great performances from Pesci , De Niro , and Bracco. The movie is based on a true story which makes it even better. There is a great script and never a dull moment. The right kind of music seems to sink in at just the right time. Brilliant film techniques such as narration , freezing , and flashbacks. Definitely one of Scorsese's best. Although he once again got passed up for best director.

One of the most intense and electric crime dramas ever to grace the silver screen,"Godfellas in many ways represents the peak of Martin Scorsese's career as a filmaker. It is a classic in the truest sense of the word. Rarely have I ever seen a film that is as consistently memorable and captivating as Goodfellas. This is due to a variety of reasonsThe acting from all the major characters in this film is unbelievably good. The characters of Tommy, Jimmy, and Henry (played by Joe Pesci, Robert De Niro, and Ray Liotta respectively) in particular are given larger than life, commanding preformances by their respective actors that do wonders to keep the audience on the edge of their seats for long periods of time.The direction and cinematography of Goodfellas is thoroughly exceptional. The camerawork is remarkably engrossing, almost acting as it's own character. The camera in this movie is constantly moving, relentlessly stalking the characters, and it is used masterfully to heighten the suspense and drama of many key moments throughout the story. There are also many unforgettable set pieces throughout the film which perfectly convey just how unforgiving and frantic the life of a Mobster is.The screenplay and writing of the characters is also absolutely stellar. The characters are cleverly written and portrayed so that they are undoubtedly evil and amoral, but not amoral enough to not get invested in their survival. The scenes of dialogue between the characters are also unbelievably tense, and nail biting, to the point that it can feel very hard to watch.The entire pace of this film is incredibly fast and unrelenting. There is NEVER a dull moment at any point during Goodfellas. There is always something going on and the film grabs your attention and holds it like few others.Overall, Goodfellas is, in my opinion, Scorsese's masterpiece. It is a iconic classic of the gangster genre and a watching it is an experience that you will never forget.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Corruption was  everywhere,"The GoodfellasOne of the most amazing criminal movies about gangsters.Criminal life has always been like in this also in other parts of the world . In the 90s in Russia people were killed for saying a bad word.This we can also see in the Goodfellas, when Tommy was insulted by his old friend. Tommy used to work for him as a cleaner.It was so easy to lose your life.Judges, police, politicians, security guards - everyone belonged to a criminal circle. Corruption was everywhere.One could rob and then kill easily.It was easy to lose life. Gangsters didn't care about stupid jobs. They didn't know what it was to pay bills.The Goodfellas shows us the criminal life in those times. It was a great time,people could do anything, but this time changed after drugs were released on the market. In America you could get 20 years in prison for selling drugs. Nobody wanted it.The ending impressed me so much.Robert De Niro and Joe Pesco played their roles so perfect like in Casino movie.

I don't know why gangster movies have this fascination factor. Likely because most of us want to see that life without consequences.I'm grateful this film was made and can be enjoyed occasionally as I grow old. So many great scenes.

Amazing,"To see an artist working at the peak of his power, everything extraneous stripped away, every element there for a purpose, is an extraordinary exhilaration.Martin Scorsese gave us that pure, hot, unquestioned power last in ""Raging Bull"" and, in virtuosity alone, ""GoodFellas"" is ""Raging Bull"" squared. (It opens Friday at selected theaters.)Scorsese has hardly been marking time in the 10 years between the two; ""After Hours"" and his ""Life Lessons"" segment of ""New York Stories"" showed just how much he has matured, grown more intelligently ironic and is even more astonishingly in command of his craft. ""GoodFellas,"" which somehow mixes its horrors with a deep vein of mordant humor, flows with the exuberance of a filmmaker who has every detail nailed and a few new lovely moves he wants to show us.His characters--a savage quartet that includes Robert DeNiro, a truly chilling Joe Pesci, Paul Sorvino and Ray Liotta--are the same ones he has been considering since ""Mean Streets"": the wise guys of his neighborhood, different from us in that pity seems to have been left out of their DNA and an off-handed brutality slipped into its place.Obviously, this is Coppola's and Puzo's turf, too, but Coppola's grandiose characters, rubbing shoulders with senators and popes, are like figures from grand opera. Scorsese's gangsters, his wise guys, are pure street level, they're the stuff of popular song that Scorsese threads through his picture--Tony Bennett, Bobby Vinton, the Crystals.""GoodFellas' "" no-nonsense street tone comes straight from journalist Nicholas Pileggi's book ""Wise Guy,"" a shrewd distillation of 30 years in the Mafia through the eyes of one of its sidewalk mechanics. Half-Sicilian, half-Irish Henry Hill (Liotta) began by running nimbly for the wise guys at the corner cabstand when he was 12; 30 years later, when it became clear that it was either them or him, he turned on them with exactly the same agility.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"First Taxi Driver, then Raging Bull, now this. Simply perfect.","Which makes Martin Scorsese one of the best movie directors in the world. Many may argue which Scorsese movie is the best (for me it will always be TD).I have always loved the crime genre, and the drama, both of does makes excellent crime drama - which is in my opinion the best movie genre ever because I love it so much. This movie takes that genre into a much, much more gritty and dark direction which I haven't quite seen. You talk about Godfather, it may be dark in many aspects, but nowhere is it as close as Goodfellas when it comes to grittiness.This movie tells the biographical life of former mobster Henry Hill during his life from the later 50's into the early 1980's, in such a great fashion from brilliant movie director Martin Scorsese. I feel as if Henry Hill has a radical transformation, and how his life as a mobster changes so fast. Ray Liotta gives a breath taking performance. And what can I say about Bob De Niro that hasn't already been said, he is always great and this movie is one of his later success in his career before he went goodbye as an amazing actor. Joe Pesci? He is such a brilliant actor, and this movie showed his brilliance in acting so much.

"Often imitated, never bettered","Goodfellas is often featured in the 'Top 10' greatest films ever. And, it certainly doesn't disappoint. I suppose the only person who wouldn't enjoy it is someone who really hates gangster films (or perhaps is very offended by strong language and/or violence).However, for all those who can appreciate films which show the darker side of humanity - in this case one that tells the story of (real life) gangster Henry Hill and how he climbs the ranks of the local mob. Yes, there's plenty of foul language along the way, not to mention a fair few violent 'hits' on anyone who gets in his way. So, if you're into that, then this is for you.Not only is the story gripping, but the performances and direction are all up to scratch. You know it's a high quality cast when someone - in this case Joe Pesci - actually manages to upstage Robert DeNiro (the 'waiter' and the 'clown' scenes to start with). But, Pesci aside, all the cast play their parts brilliantly and you can't really fault any of them.If you haven't seen Goodfellas, you really need to. Even if you don't like gangster films, you may actually enjoy this one. It's certainly one you'll need to know about when people are discussing it down the pub!

"Goodfellas... good, but not great","After renting the first three seasons of The Sopranos, I decided to rent Goodfellas, a film I had heard and read so many good things about. After watching the movie, I was a bit disappointed. The beginning of the film worked well for me - one could really get in the head of young Henry and understand what turned him on to the wise guy life. I loved the detail in the first third of the film. The storytelling took a bad turn for me, though. Everything after his marriage seemed to spiral out of a personal reality and into a ""this happened, and then that happened, and then that..."" form of storytelling. The last third just moved too fast for me; I lost my connection to the characters and by the time the end credits rolled around I wasn't connected to the gravity of what was going on. All in all, Goodfellas is a good film, but it is not the mob classic I was expecting it to be.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

One of the Worst Films Ever Made,"Whats the best film by Martin Scorsese? Taxi Driver all the way.Okay, I will disagree with the popular and critic opinion that this is one of the best films ever, in fact, this is one of the worst films ever made. Why? Well, the acting is superb, the structure is superb as well, the cinematography is superb. In a technical sense, Goodfellas is one of the most well constructed and articulated films ever made. It truly grabs you by the neck and takes you on to a journey you will never forget.And that;'s why it is one of the worst films ever made: it is easy to make a pathetically bad film, such as ""Dude Where is My Car?"", it is not easy to make a film that makes you hate the entire cast of characters. The fact is that each one of the characters in this film is terrible: Tommy DeVito is among the most pathetic characters ever made: a guy who kills people due to his own insecurity. I wanted to see him suffer, but the film never let him suffer, that made me anxious!This is a great film, but not great in the good sense, its great in the bad sense.

I'm sure I would have enjoyed it more without the Tommy DeVito character.,"I found this movie quite annoying, mainly due to the Tommy DeVito character acting so stupid.I couldn't believe a criminal organisation wouldn't have been caught before they did, with such a moron in it who would shoot a bar boy in the foot just for not being quick enough with the coffee. If that character hadn't been in it, I'm sure I would have been a lot more believable.I know that there are people like that in the world, but there's no way they would get away with much if people acted that stupid and obvious.It had a good message about how it's better to not get involved with those types and didn't glamorise it as with the Godfather films.

Goodfellas's review,"JUST finished watching this film and I'm still speechless of how great this film is,im glad I live in a world where Martin Scorsese exists I mean he and everyone involved in this film just took perfection into a whole new other level,Scorsese added his own signature and his own touch to this genre his way of telling a story is unique in it's own special way,how he transitions from the beginning the middle and the end is nothing like I've ever witnessed before,the soundtrack fits the plot so much,and the acting is just exhilarating great performances from Ray Liotta,joe Pesci and Robert de Niro especially Liotta's and pesci's portrayals,but I have to say I am saddened to see that Ray Liotta hasn't had a good role since the 1990 crime drama,he's unfortunately one of the most potentially wasted actors in Hollywood definitely up there with Edward Norton,anyways this film's producers and cast delivered some of the best scenes in cinema history,ever since I saw this film three days ago I saw it again twice,as far back as I can remember(see what I did there) I don't think I have ever rated a film a 10/10 but this one truly deserves it",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Thoroughly bad-ass,"This is one of those movies that's pretty much nothing but classic scenes. Thinking about ""Goodfellas"" is essentially re-imagining the entire movie, usually starting of with Joe Pesci. Pesci's is by far the most threatening character in this movie, and the atmosphere gets really tensed when someone gets in his way somehow. He doesn't want to be pushed, and you don't want him to be pushed. The scene where he asks what makes him funny is one of the most uncomfortable moments ever caught on film. This movie often feels uncomfortable in fact. Whenever any secondary character is involved in a conversation, you know something will go wrong. The shady background characters in this movie really drop like flies, this movie has an incredible amount of raw violence and ice cold death scenes. Even by the standards of a classic crime movie, this movie just feels really harsh and unpleasant. Which doesn't make it any less entertaining, by the way, this movie really knows when to move on. I'm not going as far as calling this the best gangster film ever made, but it's up there.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Film-making at its finest.,"Martin Scorsese is hailed by many as the greatest living American filmmaker, but with the passing of Swedish master auteur Ingmar Bergman in 2007, I would argue that Scorsese is the greatest living filmmaker in the world. ""Goodfellas"" is a perfect example of the brilliance of Scorsese, as he takes his audience inside a world that is often misunderstood by the general population.The film feels unbelievably authentic, not just because it's based on actual events, but because Scorsese understands this world as well as any filmmaker ever could. Growing up on the streets of Manhattan's Lower East Side, Scorsese had plenty of exposure to the violent world of the ""Mafia."" Scorsese understands better than anyone the destructive nature of the ""mafia"" lifestyle, but he also understands how appealing it can be. That is what makes ""Goodfellas"" such an incredibly powerful film, the fact that the characters are not portrayed as one-dimensional villains, but are presented as ordinary men who have been seduced by the lifestyle from an early age.Scorsese does a masterful job of creating a world where death seems like an inevitability. The famous ""Funny Guy"" scene is one of the most powerful scenes in movie history because it so effectively captures the volatility of the mafia lifestyle. The truth is, your best friend one day, can become your worst enemy the next. Nothing gets in the way of business, and as a result, friendships are of secondary importance. No filmmaker is better at probing the psyches of violent men than Scorsese. He burrows into the world of the mafia and doesn't attempt to sugarcoat it, which results in a film that is incredibly violent and profane, but never gratuitous.""Goodfellas"" is not only a masterpiece and one of the greatest films of the 1990s, but it is further proof that Martin Scorsese is a filmmaker of incomparable talent.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Just great,"(9.5) Goodfellas is just a great movie all around. Henry Hill, the protangonist played by Ray Liotta, was just a little boy when he started to get involved in the mafia. He played an important role and eventually became an important member. Goodfellas is about the story of this young boy and how he was a key part of the italian mafia. Not only did this movie have great acting but it also had greta characters. Likeable and hateable characters. Henry was a gangster and a criminal but I was rooting for him the whole movie unlike Jimmy or Tommy. Goodfellas relaly makes you understand how crazy the italian mafia really was. These guys could do and get anything without being stopped. Overall a great movie that really made me fall in love with the mafia genre.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
The best film ever made.,"Even when this film was released, there were plenty of Italian mafia films to watch and enjoy. Some good, some bad, and some severely overrated. But only Goodfellas, to this day, has ever handled the subject matter with such an unforgiving amount of raw, revealing truth. This is what ""The Life"" really looks like. It's beautiful, it's enticing, but most of all, it's brutal and depressing. And this film captures all those elements perfectly without adding a bunch of circus-like, drama theater nonsense for the sake of aesthetic. Being authentic and ruthlessly accurate to the subject matter naturally forms its own unique aesthetic; one many film goers could identify with because it wasn't trying to be flashy--it was trying to be real. And by God they succeeded.This film follows the rise and fall of one Henry Hill, a half Italian, half Irish mobster who got his start (as a pre-teen) in the 1950's by parking wiseguys' Cadillacs and Lincolns. His involvement only stayed innocent for a short time. Soon, he was peddling stolen cartons of cigarettes and even blowing up cars with Molotov cocktails. Although the man himself participated in activities many of us view as despicable, he never shied away from telling the truth. His honesty is admirable, and without it, it could've been decades later before we truly had a first-hand account of what it was really like being a mobster during the golden age, and the eventual downfall. Henry Hill passed away in 2012 from complications related to heart disease, one day after his 69th birthday.Henry Hill is the star of the show, but he's far from a one-man band. Joe Pesci's performance as Tommy DeVito shows us how truly psychotic some of the men were in the mafia; willing to murder someone in a split second over something normal people would shrug off without a second thought. At the same time, he can be lovable and down to earth; showing us the facade many of these men could put up at a moment's notice. One moment he's brutally murdering someone, and the next he's having a pleasurable dinner with his elderly mother who's busting his chops about not settling down with a nice woman. All in the same day!Lorraine Bracco plays Karen Hill; Henry's wife. Seeing her get sucked into The Life so easily is quite honestly terrifying. She couldn't have been further from what Henry was, yet the flashiness of the mobster lifestyle attracted her like cartoonish characters on the front of a cereal box would attract a grocery cart full of kids. And once she realizes how deceptive The Life can be, it's already too late. She's in. And there's no turning back.Robert De Niro's performance as Jimmy Conway is quite possibly the one that sticks with me the most. He's the perfect example of how paranoia can turn you into a completely different person; causing you to flip out and cause a scene over something as banal as a man's wife wearing a nice coat after a heist. Or going to devastating lengths when you start wondering, ""Who can I really trust?"" Of course, for many true paranoids, the answer is: No one.This is Scorsese at his best. While many of his films are amazing, and also 10/10's, the lightning in a bottle captured in this film will most likely never be replicated. Not by Scorsese, or anyone, for that matter. This is a film everyone should watch. It's enjoyable as all films should be, but eye-opening unlike any other.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Not The Godfather,"The first 15' are a masterpiece. The good use of voice over helps to create the perfect origin story for the protagonist, remembering his childhood, while naturally dropping needed exposition for the whole story to work. It's perfect.But I have to be honest, that's kind of the peak of the movie. I just don't think Ray Liotta was good enough to make me enjoy the film, nor it was his character. And I know it was based on real life, but that didn't harm De Niro and Pesci, which were awesome.
And Lorraine Bracco tried but couldn't save another terrible and annoying female character ""written"" by Scorsese (with Taxi Driver, a terrible one, with The King of Comedy, an annoying one). To be fair to Scorsese, plenty of his characters are obnoxious, so I'm not sure this is sexism. And yes, the character is based in real life, so maybe, just maybe, he was being true to life to a fault. My point: why she had to have so much screen time if that's all she was (terrible character)? It wasn't really that important to the main plot.Anyways. It is technically, a great movie. It tells a really complex and quite big story, with a brutality that is welcomed, and some scenes are beyond great (all of them involve Pesci and De Niro).But:
He overuses the voice over (it works when the film is a character study or at least when it's only one character doing it).
The insistence on making characters annoying, actually annoyed me.
And the ambivalent performance from the lead (he works well when sentimental and really poorly otherwise), plus the unnecessary large part for ""the annoying wife"", all of them converge to create another flawed masterpiece.

Superb Realism,"The acting by the main three -- Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro, and Joe Pesci -- is brought forward with such realism that it allows you to truly see how ruthless and evil the mafia is.Much like in The Godfather, we get to see a retrospective that shows why people become involved in the Mafia and also the focus is much more on the killings and tense interactions between members if they let down the boss rather than showing their lives and making you feel sorry for them. That aspect is showed a little but not as much as other mafia films.I also want to send high praise to Martin Scorsese for his phenomenal directing once again as in Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and Shutter Island.The music is timed at the exact right moment to allow for the film to seem as if it has been made in one continuous shot and therefore editing looks flawless and seamless.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Goodfellas,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerMartin Scorsese has made some of my all time favorite films. Goodfellas is one of my favorites. The story is slick, funny, brutal, and memorable. The dialogue is sharp and fluid. The characters are deep, relatable, and unique.The acting is masterful. Ray Liotta gives the best performance of his career. Robert De Niro, as always, performs best as a gangster. Joe Pesci gives one of his best performances as the loose cannon Tommy. All the other actors in the film perform masterfully.The pacing is perfect and the runtime is perfect. Everything about this film is perfect.The only downside to this film is that the violence is a little outdated.Pros: Slick, funny, brutal, and memorable story, fluid dialogue, unique characters, masterful acting, perfect pacing, and a good runtimeCons: Some of the violence is outdatedOverall Rating: 9.6",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Pefrfect Film,"Ever since The Godfather first premiered way back in 1972, I find it quite the challenge to call any subsequent gangster film a great one. Not only do such films need to have a really gripping and remarkable story. these films should be orchestrated by a director who has enough knowledge of this crime sub-genre and is able to deftly juggle all of the filmmaking elements to create a truly fascinating motion picture. Goodfellas is such a film. It is a movie that I have a deep affection for. An affection that only increases after every viewing. Goodfellas is one of the best films you will ever see. It is a rich and expansive motion picture that grabs your attention from the very first scene and never lets go. There have been so many films since The Godfather that have tried, and failed, to give us another gangster movie to remember. A few have succeeded, with Goodfellas being one of them. With the distinguished acting talents of Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, and Joe Pesci, along with the masterful direction of Martin Scorsese, this is a really unique gangster film. Whenever I am about to watch Goodfellas, I always get the feeling that I am on the verge of experiencing something grand and exquisite, a characteristic of any great film. Simply put, Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas is an enduring classic for the ages. I'm gonna give THE GOODFELLAS a 10\10 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
As far back as I can remember I always wanted to be a gangster.,"I don't know how I didn't review this movie before. It's still an absolute masterpiece. I just loved Ray Liotta's performance with Joe Pesci; Robert DeNiro and Lorraine Bracca. Based on the true story of Henry Hill, he narrated the story of his life in crime almost unapologetically at times. Martin Scorsese was a genius in recreating the era with sounds, music, costumes. Too bad, the film lost best picture to ""Dances with Wolves."" Liotta's performance of Henry Hill was once in a lifetime for him. He played him beautifully. Robert DeNiro's Jimmy Conway also was brilliant as well. Joe Pesci deserved his Academy Award for playing Tommy DeVito. Mama Scorsese played Mother Devito in the movie. When the film credits rolled, the musical rendition of ""Layla,"" was just unforgettable and intertwined with the scenes of those dead bodies in the pink cadillac and frozen in the truck. The cast was brilliant as everything in the film was. A true classic that we don't get tired of watching ever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"""Just because you are a character, doesn't mean you have character""","Henry Hill's character was terribly written.

Distasteful to put it mildly,"I wanted to give ""Goodfellas"" a fair shake before reviewing it so I did watch it all but I have not changed my opinion about this film. I still strongly dislike it. The characters are all so awful and unlikeable that it gets tiresome as there is no one to root for. And the end is like a slap in the face about mocking average law-abiding people. No one here learns anything or has any moral crisis or remorse, it simply wallows in kitsch, triviality, violence, and shallowness, a sad depiction of Amerian life. And no other sort of life is at all shown. In ""Goodfellas"" world there are only bad people, and only they really live. A poor message and a poor movie about people I don't like or care anything about. So, my rating 1/10. I'm surprised this is ranked so highly on the IMDB top list.

One of the top mob films!,The language of the movie is excellent. Great portrayal of characters. The story is well held together. The film had trademark atmospheric photography and very good acting. The action lacked a bit of reality though. De Niro shines in the film. The film follows Henry Hill as he is brought into the mob life at a young age and how it brings him down at the end.

Like getting a kick in the teeth (in a good way),"""As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster. To me, being a gangster was better than being President of the United States."" I might as well face it. I've become a huge mafia/mob movie fan. Sometime last year, when I worked at my local video store, I purchased The Godfather trilogy box set. I bought it because I felt it was just something I should have. Because I was a huge movie fan, I felt that I needed to own what was regarded as the greatest film trilogy of all time. Did I actually feel like sitting down for three hours and watching one of the movies? No way. So, it sat on my shelf for a very long time. One weekend at college, I was feeling very bored so I decided to put in ""The Godfather"" and watch it. Wow. I've been changed. This may be my favorite movie. Then came ""The Godfather Part II"" which was equal to the first one. I was captivated, because I was not used to film-making that was so consistent, raw, and powerful. Francis Ford Coppola's movies opened the door for me to see film, as well as society, in a whole new light.I'm new to Martin Scorsese, but after being amazed with his movie ""The Aviator"", I decided to rent his take on the Italian underworld, ""Goodfellas"". This movie is amazing. Simply amazing, because it is an example of absolutely pure film-making that hasn't been tainted by time or the latest trends. Scorsese had plenty of opportunities to screw up ""Goodfellas"" with clichés and cheap film techniques, but he decided to stick with his roots and make a picture that was instead fueled by simple, un-adulterated ""camera on actor"" (for lack of a better term) power. Scorsese understands the language of film more than probably any other director still working today. He is amazing, because every shot that he sets up is set up for a reason. He never does anything weird simply for the sake of being weird or drawing attention to himself. Everything that he does is done to tell the story and only that. In ""Goodfellas"", Scorsese does not glorify the life of the mafia. If anything, ""Goodfellas"", is a decidedly anti-mob movie. You see everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, that goes on in this underground business. The film is very very violent, but it is never out-of-line with the story. The characters are violent men, and therefore should be portrayed that way honestly. Roger Ebert calls this ""the best mob movie ever"" and while I disagree with him there, ""Goodfellas"" has earned a very high place on that list.Four stars (****)",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"Great maffia film , one of Scorcese' best films","This is a freat film about a young boy who looked up to mobsters.he figured that if he could become one , people would respect him and fear him also.He started working for the maffia very young and people started to fear , but also respect him.Just like he expected.He climbs up higher on the ladder as he becomes older and wiser.Though one day he has to make a choice : Getting murdered or betraying his maffia friends.This is an excellent film about the maffia.The oscar Joe Pesci received was correctly given to him.It is without any doubt his best role.Robert de Niro is outstanding too.This movie shows how mobsters live and the most important is that , I think , it kind of goes that way.The image is very realistic but we must always see everything with a pinch of salt.The best maffia film after the Godfather and Scarface!

Impeccably well-done,"This review is based on the 2-Disc Special Edition release. I haven't read the novel, nor do I know anything about Hill that this film didn't tell me, but I understand that that this is a faithful adaptation, and that both give an honest recounting of his life. This can perhaps best be described as a portrayal of the environment, showing good and bad alike. The glamorous nature of that way of life is put up on the screen, and you definitely understand its appeal. Scorsese doesn't fail us for a second of this. It is brutal, funny, charming, bloody, intense and entertaining. The writing is excellent. Narration as well as dialog are incredible and highly memorable and quotable. The plot is interesting and develops nicely. Strong storytelling is one of the things that keeps you watching. The characters and personalities is another. Cinematography and editing are top-notch. The scoring is spot-on, with every music piece being fantastic and fitting(directly or ironically) at the same time. Every single acting performance is perfect, not only Liotta, Pesci and of course DeNiro. The pacing is marvelous. Mood and atmosphere are established masterfully. The language doesn't hold back, neither in tone nor in amount. There is some sexuality, not terribly graphic. Violence is unrestrained. This has disturbing content. The DVD comes with four featurettes(coming to about an hour in running time, all put together), as well as two commentary tracks... ""Cast and Crew""(self-explanatory) and ""Cop and Crook""(the actual Henry, and one of the feds who worked against the mob). All of it is worth the time. I recommend this to fans of gangster movies and/or authentic, biographical ones. Just make sure you can handle it. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Hmmm....Over-rated-see this or Casino and you've seen it before.,"I hadn't ever seen this one, save for parts on the idiot box, so I didn't quite know what to expect. To hear the critics drooling about GF, you'd think this was better than the first two Godfathers or Casino or whatever. Well I hate to burst anyone's bubble, but it's NOT. Its too long, Ray Liotta is OK but comes off having as much Mobster credibility onscreen as Potsy from 'Happy Days'. And I didn't feel bad for him one little bit when the Feds got him and his wife.The rest-DeNiro, Pesci, Sorvino-age some in this thing, which after all goes from c.53-the early 80s. But does Ray? Not from what I could see. I donno why that was, as he is about as babyfaced as Robbie Benson, its hard to tell how old the guy is, but I do know he should have shown some aging at least. Its almost as if he's stuck in the same age the whole film and watches the rest of the mob universe parade by.Watch this, then see Casino-you have basically the same movie, with DeNiro and Pesci trotting out the same old characters they have each played scads of times. Yeah you hear all about DeNiro's great versatility, but c'mon-Raging Bull this ain't. He was somewhat more refined in Casino than he was here, he shot more folks in Ronin, he was loonier in 'The Fan', but I think DeNiro's just mailing it in sometimes now. Pesci goes kookoo at the drop of a hat in this, I really despised the vile scene of him shooting the young kid waiter, and wonder what Scorsese was thinking when he put that in. Don't give me that 'its what these guys do in real life, its in character' crap-that is like the equally so-violent-its-stoopid aluminum baseball bats chorus that you get to see at the finale of Casino. Overkill is overkill, plain and simple.Pesci was better in JFK and Casino, but played the same kinda guy too, save in JFK Ferrie was, well....like his name sez.You get the same old Scorsese bag of tricks-his folks play some minor parts, the characters narrate the goings ons, the camera work is flashy, the Mob is alternately glorified then shown for what it is, the shootings, explosions and stabbings are filmed with bravado, skill and from many angles, jest in case you happened to miss them the first time. I get the feeling when seeing Casino or Goodfellas that I'm watching a guy with a PHD in Film School showing off to all us peons. And I'm not impressed. I have seen this all before.Lorraine Bracco was pretty good then kinda shelved as the film went on. Paul Sorvino was probably the best thing about the film, and he just trots out the same old 'Mean Paul' bit you can see in the 'Rocketeer' and 'Oh God', if you want my honest opinion.This film was Not better than Dancing With Wolves, and therefore, was Not unfairly passed over by Oscar, despite the rantings of its many Acolytes.Good movie? Sure. Great? Nahhh. Better than the Three Godfathers? Nope, save for maybe the IIIrd.*** outta ****; somewhat of a big 'So What' reaction by Gazzo-2 this time out.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Not so great,"I know most of people consider this to be a great classic masterpiece, but for me, the story was not very interesting, I felt it was washed down and lack of tension or built up.Neither the characters were interesting, Liotta's was very bland to be honest, not his acting, but the character itself didn't have much going on, to say or to do. He just goes around with not much personality or brains.De Niro and Pesci were more interesting but quite a stereotype and they had nothing new to add to the classic formula of the mafia movie.I do like these kind of movies, I was really looking forward to watch this for a long time, as I watch it when I was a kid back in the 90s, but I was highly disappointed.I found Karen Hill (Bracco) highly obnoxious and overacted, she pretty much ruined every scene where she appears.The trial scene where the fourth wall is broken was an absolute unnecessary absurd, did I miss something there?Overall, just a few scenes were entertaining, I wish they were part of a better story.There are many mafia movies much better than this, why people loves this one so much, I can't understand.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

A very good mobster film...,"'GoodFellas' is an interesting piece. It has the mobster-romance of Godfather and the gritty reality of Scarface all in one. Yet, it is perhaps less than the sum of all its parts. Mob-films aren't typically cheery or uplifting but keeping a safe-zone where the audience isn't too bothered by all the evil things going on screen is something I really missed and something which I think The Godfather succeeded much better in accomplishing.On its own the film is none the less fantastic. It feels like a twisted kind of reality where you're not exactly sure what's real and what's not. Perhaps I get a little squeamish when drugs become an element in the story but that might be just me. There is a great deal of irony in the film but it lacks the likability of The Godfather.On the whole that might not be a fair comparison as Coppola's films made up a saga where as this had to wrap the mobster tale in one movie. It's definitely a great film for fans of mobster films, but not a master-piece and way too gory and bleak. On the whole I thought the performances were, none-the-less, great. Robert DeNiro, Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci are amongst my favorite actors and each deliver a brilliant character to the screen.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Great Movie,"Rating: 9.3
Overall, a Great movie that is incredible for the first 3/4 as you get to see Martin Scorsese work in his natural element to create one of the mob movies that defined him as you go through the life of Henry Hill and his rise in crime, though the final 1/4 of the movie felt dragging and underdeveloped (leaving the audience not as satisfied as they were throughout the film earlier).Incredible Direction (With the ability to handle such fast paced moments with a lot of moving parts at once and the conversations between characters), Great Acting (Very Good to Great from Robert Di Nero (though his character really does not have that much of a presence in relation to his billing for the movie), Great from Ray Liotta (was the right person to drive the story forward, just was not that amazing in the very emotional and sad parts), Incredible from Joe Pesci (in a very Joe Pesci way), Very Good to Great from Lorraine Bracco (though the interjections in narration from her character were not that great), Good to Very Good from the rest of the cast (which is telling considering the number of characters in this movie)), Incredible Story (With Ray Liota's narration being an iconic feature for the movie in depicting the life of Henry Hill, though the final parts of the plot did drag on a bit), Incredible to Brilliant Screenplay (with the language being so fluid yet vulgar, the actions conveying the tone of the film, and the film being filled with iconic moments and lines), Incredible Cinematography (helped with setting the tone and keeping the pace going), Good Sound, Great to Incredible Editing, Plot Structure was good (though more time was spent in the first half introducing elements, the climax and the resolution dragged for a bit; the first half of the plot had a lot of elements displayed very fast while the second half had less elements and took longer that expected to explain them); I feel that the exposition and rising action were the real key points of the movie as that was what the most time was spent on and really shows the development of the characters, Pacing was very quick except towards the end (where the final 40 minutes really dragged on, and it probably could have been cut in half (still felt it dragged even though it was quick)), In my eyes there were 2 real climaxes for the movie (the build to the first one was great as they really laid out the suspense of its nature, the second climax (while not as big) was not developed that well); did not really like the ending because I felt it was very abrupt, Tone and mood of the movie is carried out so well by Martin Scorsese as this movie is a prime example of why this formula/movie genre works so well from him (in what might be his prime example for mob movies), Pretty Good score (despite not officially having one); Good soundtrack (helped set the tone of the movie); the key points of the movie that make it one of the most famous crime/mob movies is the characters that carry out incredible dialogue as it keeps the audience really hooked and care for the main three characters.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

A movie including amazing role performances and a brilliant story but sadly being a bit dull in places,"""Goodfellas"" is Martin Scorsese's highest ranked movie over at IMDb. I had never seen it before 2 days ago and to be honest it wasn't what I expected it to be. Don't get me wrong, it is all in all a great movie, but like Scorsese's movies usually it's over-hyped. ""Goodfellas"" is based on a true story and it tells a story about Henry Hill who grows up to be a gangster, a part of the mob. Along with his friends, other wiseguys Tommy DeVito and Jimmy Conway, the movie tells about how organized the mafia really is and follows the rise and fall of Henry Hill from the beginning till the end.The movie progresses very well with the narration of Henry Hill, who's played by Ray Liotta. The narration's excellent and keeps the movie going in a good flow with it's precise use of words and witty sarcasm. I've never been so impressed of Liotta's performance than I was after this movie, he does his best role performance yet to date and does it by far. Liotta evolves the character so realistically, by emotions and doing the whole progress of the character's corruption in a so believable way. The role of Tommy DeVito is played by Joe Pesci who has always been enjoyable for me, he has that personal voice and essence which can't be compared to any actor. I've never seen Joe Pesci in such a serious role before and to me he did some fine job in it. He also does his best role performance yet to date. Then there's the mighty Robert De Niro, who plays the role of Jimmy Conway, and you can't go wrong with De Niro now can you? He is perfect for the role and to be honest the whole cast is chosen very specifically, each right actor/actress for the right role. Amazing role performances indeed.The screenplay is brilliant, the story in its wholeness is a real treat for you and that's one of the reasons why you can't miss this movie. Sadly, the movie suffers from one significant problem; It's too long and that is pretty much the only reason why it doesn't deserve a 10. The first hour goes very smoothly and things keep on going all the time, you don't get bored in any part. After that it kinda stops, I wouldn't say it's downhill after that but I'd say it just stops the whole smoothness and the flow. I hate to say this, but it does get slightly too boring, hence why I said it's too long. I feel so bad because of it as this would have been a perfect movie without it being too long. The second hour just isn't nearly as interesting as the first, a real shame indeed. What comes to direction, well it's Scorsese and to me it's pretty much as excellent as it can get. You just have to admire that style of his, being oddly joyful in parts where sadness should take place. The whole soundtrack is also very Martin Scorsese stylish, not including any beautiful compositions but some really groovy and great tracks, which also play an important role in the whole progress of the movie.""Goodfellas"" is a great movie, but for me personally it was rather disappointing. Having an average rating of 8.7 at IMDb it should be amazing, shouldn't it? Maybe the slight disappointment is because of the movie being over-hyped, yeah, most certainly. Despite it being a slight disappointment for me it's still a definite recommendation for all of you who love great movies. You don't have to like mob movies in general, as this movie gives the whole mob thing some real depth in it, giving a realistic sort of an inside-look of it. It's not phenomenal, but it's definitely a great movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Brilliant from start to finish,"This movie was excellent in terms of what Scorese wanted his audience to see. The way the mafia world works and how different it is in terms of normal everyday life. The start of the movie was brilliant and done in a way a mafia movie should be done, with a bit of violence. The scenes in the movie were beautifully constructed and shot, like the time Henry takes Karen out to the restaurant and Henry introduces the mafia members, like Johnny 2 time because he says everything twice. During this whole scene the camera doesn't cut which is a piece of brilliance from Scorese as it makes you feel as though you are a part of the mafia family. The acting in the movie is brilliant, Ray Liotta, Robert de Niro and the brilliant and funny Joe Pesci, also Paul Sorvino should not go unnoticed for his part. What I found incredible is that the academy failed to reward Scorese for his work in this movie and they still have not today even with The Aviator.

If Pileggi's book is accurate, this film is also accurate.

"Lacks focus, but lifted up by stellar performances","Upon rewatching the movie, I realized two things.One, the performances by everyone, down to the smallest role, are stellar and memorable. Joe Pesci stands out in what may be one of the most despicable characters ever to grace the big screen. He plays a thin skinned maniac who readily kills people over as much as a misunderstanding.That is the general jist of the movie. Life is cheap in the mafia. People get whacked all the time. Even the suspicion that someone may talk is a death sentence.The movie does a fantastic job portraying life in the mafia. The hierarchies, the shady dealings over meatballs with marinara sauce and the casual conversations between the wives about people getting shot.Scorcese's direction is assured as ever, the sets and production design are spot on, and the trademark montages make the movie pass quicker than its 2 1/2 hour runtime would make you think. But it's still a long movie. And that's where point number two comes in: The movie lacks narrative focus. For most of the runtime, you don't know where the movie is going. It's a collection of montages, monologues, gory killings, but there's no narrative thrust. The movie meanders along until things inevitably fall apart towards the end, but the various happenings never really feel like they have anything to do with each other. We don't see the big heist, we don't get any foreshadowing of the turn at the end, we don't see the effects that the intro scene has on the mafia. 90% of the movie is people in rooms talking, drinking and either introducing themselves or talking about events we never see. There's way too much expository dialogue.It's still a fine movie, deserving to be seen at least once, even if it's not one of the all time greats.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"Classic direction, though schizophrenic.","This film is considered the definitive mob film, probably more because Martin Scorsese is quite possibly the best living American director. If Francis Ford Coppola (director of ""The Godfather"" trilogy) were still alive, he may disagree with this assessment -- and if he did, I would have to agree with him.Granted, the direction is brilliant, especially on the opening credits, the beginning of Liotta's flashback, the psychedelic feel of the end, and the stunning tracking shot that introduces Liotta and Bracco's first date, but there are so many postmodern innovations that the viewer is veritably jarred. With repeated viewings (which have made this film a classic) this alienation is felt less so, but there is nothing here to challenge Coppola's christening scene.Nonetheless, not enough can be said, especially about this movie's acting. Pesci's star-turn is celebrated, but kudos must also go to the always underrated Liotta whose subtley suits his role perfectly. De Niro is wasted but good playing the role he always plays (could he be anything less than good?) and Paul Sorvino is perfectly understated in a supporting role. The real praise must go to Lorraine Bracco, the only character to experience a full spate of emotions. She is the most convincing female character ever in a gangster film and doesn't have enough scenes, to my taste.The plot - what little there is - weakens the film. The main character's ambiguous goal is to become a gangster, but this does not drive the film. Events happen to him, rather than grow out of his own actions making him difficult to sympathize with. The unsatisfying ending is too quick (as if Scorsese knew his movie was getting a tab bit overlong) and also unsatisfying, though he did the latter on purpose as a point of theme.Overall, a must-see film, though I prefer the better-directed and more engaging plot of ""Casino,"" which, unfortunately is often-panned as a rip-off of this film. Both film's are ridiculously and violent unlike the early Hollywood gangster flicks which were juist as - if not more - thematically effective.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"excellent movie, but soundtrack CD is a ripoff","the soundtrack CD for this movie could easily be a 2 or even 3 disc set, so many excellent songs left off. George Harrison's ""What Is Life"", The Rolling Stones ""Monkey Man"", (and dare I say it?) Jerry Vale (whatever song he was singing during nightclub scene with Henry and Janice), and so many others. (I'll even go out on a limb and say ""My Way"" by Sid Vicious. lol.) Few directors used music to compliment what's on the screen better than Scorcese did in this movie, and most of his others, for that matter. A perfect example is when Henry, Paulie, et al are in prison in the 1970's , and Bobby Darin's ""Beyond the Sea"" from 1960 is the background. IMHO, it's a kind of time warp, even though things ""on the outside"" have changed, and our boys are in the hoosegow, they're still living like kings.All opinions welcome, as long as they are coherent. lol",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Martin Scorcese's Best Film of his Time.,"""As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be an gangster."" -Henry Hill. 1955 New York. Martin Scorcese's film of violence and drama spills on the big screen in Goodfellas. The true story of the New York gangster Henry Hill. Ray Liotta plays Henry Hill, who gets enticed through the stages of an gangster when he pursues his dreams with his partners, Jimmy Conway and Tommy DeVito, played by Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. Throughout the film, Henry goes through marrying his wife, played by Lorraine Bracco and having an family. The person who got him involved in the gangster business is Paul Cicero, played by Paul Sorvino. After a while, Henry goes to prison and gets out. Then, after Pesci's character is a made man, the good times of Henry being an gangster begins with an killing of a man. Scorcese's film making shines in the movie. Pesci's performance as well as Bracco, Liotta and De Niro are terrific. Goodfellas is one of the best films of 1990 and it's on my Number 1 Best Film of 1990. Here, the movie never bothers to fall behind or gets dull. It's an absolute masterpiece of Scorcese's cinema. ★★★★ 4 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
A truly god-like masterpiece,"First off, the Academy Awards have been wrong before like with Raging Bull in 1980 or with Gangs of New York in 2002 but the Academy really screwed over Goodfellas in 1990. It received 6 nominations including Best Picture, Director, and Screenplay but it only walked away with Joe Pesci's astounding supporting actor roll. The movie starts with the narration which sort of guides you in the right direction if you don't know what the hell is going on but it is pretty hard to loose track. Ray Liotta gives the performance of his career as mobster Henry Hill who was arrested in 1980 and went into Witness Protection to save his ass from his ""pals"". Scorsese takes the gangster genre to another level with this film, he uses Thelma Schoonmaker to give the movie amazing editing which it also deserved an Oscar for. But...Robert DeNiro steals the show as Hill's close friend and mentor Jimmy Conway who is a veteran at being a thief, gunman, and hijacker. DeNiro steals the show as playing a wise guy/nice guy and a ruthless killer and lets not forget about Pesci who just plays a freakin' psycho who doesn't give a crap about human life. You screw with him, you're dead. You're nice to him, watch out cause he doesn't care. He kills for fun but he;s even crazier when insulted. Scorsese deserved a Best Director Oscar because in my life of watching many films and studying them, there is not quite a film like Goodfellas. It is the modern version of The Godfather.

Is it really a masterpiece?,"I just had the opportunity to revisit Goodfellas after a couple years. I was captivated from beginning to end, but I need to take a somewhat controversial stand on the movie. I thinks it's good, far better than most of what Hollywood churns out, but a classic for the ages? I don't think you should go that far.Here's my main problem: This movie does not contain a single likable character. All the performances are top notch, but that's not my point. I couldn't identify with Ray Liotta. I can understand how his character was seduced my the mob lifestyle, but as an adult he's no better than anyone else around him. In the Godfather, within the encapsulated mob-world with its own set of peculiar rules, the Corleones were actually good people. They respected their wives, they only killed when necessary for business, and their loyalty never wavered. It was easy for me, the audience member, to become entranced and actually cheer them on. In Goodfellas, on the other hand, all the men are essentially a--holes. De Niro is crazy and paranoid, Pesci is insecure and sadistic, and Ray Liotta may have charm, but he has no ethical compulsions (even by mob standards) and will try to get away with whatever he can.I bring all this up because I need to have a character I can care about. The tragic fall of Henry is only tragic if I cared about him to begin with.Secondly, I would have liked a more tangable plot. I don't mean a cookie cutter Hollywood plot, but at least give me something in the first act that gets resolved in the third. The movie plays like a series of unconnected vignettes about mob life. Yes, it's a fascinating glimpse inside the mob, but by 1990 or 91, (whenever this came out) we've already had plenty of fascinating glimpses inside the mob. When Ray Liotta gives us some talk-over narrative like ""Back then we did what we wanted and we didn't care."" I'm thinking, ""Yes Ray, we know. This isn't our first gangster movie.""If this is your favorite movie, fine, I have no problem with that. Better Goodfellas than this guy back at school who once told me that Mel Gibson's ""Man Without a Face"" was his favorite movie. But give Godfather 1 or 2 another watch, and tell me if you see what I'm saying about the likability issue.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Definately Scorsese's best film,"This is one of my top favorite films of all time. Everything about this movie was excellent. It's hard to choose who gave the best performance in this movie, because they were all too good.Based on the actual life of Henry Hill, they go through what his life was like before he ratted out his mob buddies. It's a movie you have to watch to understand.Ray Liotta plays Henry Hill. A kid who wants nothing more than to become a member of the mofia. As he does work for one of the bosses, he becomes one of them. He meets many people along the way. Including his wife, Karen. He knows when he goes too far, but does what he's told.Robert DeNiro plays Jim Conaway. A respected mobster whose seen it all and done it all. At first he appears to be a regular ""wise guy"", but eventually ends up loosing it and turns against his friend, Henry.Joe Pecsi plays Tommy DeVito. A big ""wise guy"" who does things without thinking. He thinks since he is part of the mofia and %100 Italian that he can do whatever he wants. He's good to his friends and family. But ends up paying the price in the end when he messes with a boss.Lorraine Bracco plays Karen Hill. Henry's wife. She's a woman who doesn't take any B.S. from anyone. But puts up with Henry's. After all he does to her, she sticks by his side to the end.And Paul Sorvino plays Paulie. The big boss who controls everything.

Some sentiments,"From Henry said, ""In my teens, I made more money than most adults in the whole street."" Revealing the first level, the most direct thing that gang life brings is money. Overnight, a prosperous life is at your fingertips. and. Along with the ""respect"" of the outside world, the ""extra care"" on the street greatly satisfied the vanity. This point reached a peak when Henry brought his newly engaged girlfriend into the restaurant through the back door. This long lens uses the camera's movement to the extreme. The gorgeous and smooth visual effect makes the audience feel the Henry's smoothness at the moment.
Then the situation changed sharply, and all the characters seemed to be in a madness: Jimmy began to kill a 6 million robbery, Tommy shot the young man in the bar for no reason, and was finally executed by the Gambino family (the beginning of the film has been paved) ... the film enters the second layer, the gang 's hidden tendency to self-destruction, the ease of gang life comes from the material provided by the gang, and the basic way for the gang to obtain material is terror and violence, so the essence of the gang is unethical violence, bringing The chaos makes its structure extremely unstable. This instability makes gangs often lose control when they encounter major turning points such as the drug industry.
This tendency towards self-destruction gradually develops towards the destruction of others, and the interpersonal relationships maintained by material and violence are more fragile than imagined. On the third level of the film, it is also a must-see scene for gangster films: the old brothers sold each other. Eventually Henry also chose to compromise and joined the witness protection plan. Over time, a small society disappeared in self-destruction and mutual destruction.
At the end of the film, Henry said, ""I feel like I can't leave that kind of life"", and then brought the film back to the beginning, again asking questions: knowing that it is towards destruction, why is there always someone willing to try? Because of that kind of life, an ordinary person who is in a muddled state can ""struggle"" to achieve achievements far beyond his ability. Can this gang legend be understood as a twisted American dream?",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Everyone knows it, not everyone wants to accept it. ""Goodfellas""--based on true events--explores the lives of gangsters, chronicling the events through the eyes of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), who gets involved with the Mafia at a young age and continues his ""career"" throughout the film.As he gets older, he marries and has children, but still works for the organized crime family, under mob boss Paulie (Paul Sorvino); and he is friends with Jimmy (Robert De Niro), a calm, steady gangster; and Tommy (Joe Pesci), a wild man with serious mental problems.Eventually Henry's life goes down the gutter, leading to drug abuse and paranoia, that leads to other unfortunate incidents that will be ruined if I type any more about them.""Goodfellas"" is one of the best films I have ever seen. It's a tour the force of breathtaking images, witty scriptwriting, superb acting and realistic violence.Robert De Niro gives one of his best performances -- ever -- as Jimmy, even if he's not in the film as much as you might be lead to believe from the front cover.Joe Pesci is in this movie about as much as De Niro, maybe a bit more or less. But when he's on screen there's no doubting he's on screen--he's very hard to miss. A short, deranged, loud-mouthed man with something wrong in his head. Someone makes an insult toward him and he shoots them, and then laughs. It's quite disturbing. I am a huge fan of Pesci, and I tend to love his characters, but he really makes you feel sick towards his character in ""Goodfellas,"" while at the same time taking a strange liking to him. That just goes to show how good of an actor Pesci is.Ray Liotta is perfect as Henry Hill. I can't think of a better actor to play him. He captures a sense of innocence yet at the same time a feeling of violence. I love the scene where he walks over to a man's house with a regular expression on his face. ""What do you want, f&*^&?"" the man asks. Liotta continues walking, takes out a gun, and starts to continually beat the man in the skull with the butt of his gun. As Henry walks back to his car, his face is disturbing and his expression stays with you for a long, long time.Martin Scorsese is a brilliant director and his work here is fabulous; it's been recreated by other directors (namely Paul Thomas Anderson in ""Boogie Nights"") and there's a reason: it's great stuff. He totally deserved to receive Best Director in 1990, but of course he didn't. (Rumor has it the Academy frowns on Scorsese's use of racial slurs in his work.

A classic gangster biopic that has perfection all in it..,"Goodfellas (1990) :
Brief Review -A classic gangster biopic that has perfection all in it. This one is hailed as Martin Scorsese's best till date or his first ever universally acclaimed classic film for a reason. He does it so perfectly. A biopic of a mobster is told with engaging narration, brutal screenwriting, realistic conflicts and last but not the least the perfection in all cinematic fields. Film begins on interesting note taking you into Henry's childhood days and then to teenage and then to after marriage life. His ups and downs in life were predictable but interesting throughout. The climax too is quite bit sober and predictable unless it could have been over dramatic and unrealistic. Scorsese delivers a Classic Film that left so many influences to Crime genre. All Four male main actors in the film are fabulous especially Ray Liotta and Robert De Niro (smaller role comparatively) while Joe Pesci is outshines everyone with free & wild attitude. As yhe content requires the film is violent, vulgar and brutal causing the underage audience to stay away from it but anyway they are not gonna understand anything about it until they become enough matured. I liked the entire crime World in the film. The production design never lets it look dull for a moment. Goodfellas may be a film of bad-fellas but you have to understand that how they were good-fellas for each other at least for those two and half hours. The only dislikeable thing innthe film is the bad characters but you can oftenly enjoy them on one off day. A story of a man from a common guy to the man who has world in his hands and then again an average nobody.

"Okay I suppose, but didn't really do it for me","After much hassle from the many people I know who love this film, I finally gave in to peer pressure and watched it.  I've avoided it for a few reasons, the main one being that the subject matter just doesn't appeal to me.  One of the others being that of the few Scorsese films that I have seen, I haven't liked the way he portrays women - they are usually whores, junkies or generally corrupted sad creatures.  Of course, that's also true to a certain extent of the men in his films.  I like a little more optimism in my escapism.  Anyway, I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed this film. Yes, it glamourised what is essentially a repellant lifestyle, but it didn't shy away from the nastier side - Henry's children witnessing the drug fuelled screaming rows, and the damage to their marriage being a notable one.  I had heard a lot about the violence in the film, but in today's climate, it didn't seem all that shocking really.  Joe Pesci was impressively scary, Robert De Niro brought out his stock character once again - i really think he has to be one of the most overrated actors in Hollywood,  He bores me rigid.  However, I did really like Ray Liotta, although, a little like De Niro, he's now made a career out of that one character.It's never going to make it into my top ten, but I will allow that it's a pretty good film, and of course, that it was quite a moment in fim history.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Simply great,"What is the formula behind making the perfect gangster movie? It has to be long, short gangster movies seldom work. There has to be a wide variety of characters, movies like ""The Hoodlum"" were dull because there were only a few main characters there. Here even the minor characters are well developed, enough to catch your eye. And last, it has to show some violence but in moderate quantities. There is some violence here, most notably in the ""Billy Batts scene"", but it never overflows, ""Casino"" had far more violent scenes than this film. If there is no violence whatsoever, then the movie can't be an effective gangster/mafia movie.But what is perhaps most appealing with this film is that, in contrast to movies like The Godfather trilogy, Scarface and Casino, this movie is based 100% on real events and characters. Only a few names are altered, the rest is all authentic.Robert De Niro again delivers, even though I think he has been somewhat miscast as Jimmy (Burke) Conway. Jimmy the Gent was Irish-American and even though DeNiro is part Irish himself, he doesn't look like a typical Irish-American. Burke was also a tall and imposing man, unlike DeNiro and he always chomped on a cigar. Doesn't help that DeNiro also has that unmistakable Italian-American drawl: ""Wats da madda wit u?""Pesci is just incredible and a delight to watch, despite playing a very unsympathetic character. Liotta fits his part perfectly as well and what I liked here is that they show his corruption by the mob world that embraced him in the beginning. If he had been shown as just some innocent naive sweet guy, it wouldn't look authentic, would it? Several scenes have since become classics, deservedly so. The ""Shinebox scene"" aka Billy Batts scene is perhaps the most unforgettable, but also the ""Funny Guy scene"". Elizabeth Bracco, even though not my favorite actress, offers a strong supporting role as mrs. Henry Hill, the headstrong and hot tempered Karen. Paul Sorvino is also marvelous in his somewhat restricted but pivotal part as Henry's close friend and first mentor Paulie Cicero. Frank Sivero from ""Godfather II"" is a welcome sight and his character is like a counterpart to Pesci's, a silent and unintentionally humorous sidekick.Scorsese scored big with this big screen adaptation of one of the most intriguing real-life mafia stories. This remains one of his crowning achievements.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
The Best from the Best,"Christmas. The time of year where hearing one more carol or watching one more commercial for frozen ham will surely send anyone over the edge. It's also the time that almost every major film studio tries their hand at making a quick buck by releasing some generic, light- hearted holiday movie you've probably seen in some form already. I don't care for these films at all, which is why I have all the more reason to thank Fox Classics for their Spotlight On Scorsese Week, which ended last Friday with what is, in my opinion, the greatest film ever made by the greatest filmmaker alive today.Goodfellas is the remarkably true story of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), a young boy whose imagination is captured by the prospect of being a gangster. Fast forward thirteen years, and Henry has befriended local legends Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci, in an Oscar-winning performance) as part of the mafia. The rest of the film plays out as a rise-and-fall story as old as the Roman Empire, as Henry's addiction to the good life slowly consumes him and his wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco, whose role in this film led to her big break as Jen Melfi in The Sopranos).Scorsese's two most recent feature films (Shutter Island and The Departed), while being quality efforts in their own right, are very different to his career-shaping masterpieces. They follow a structured plot, whereas his earlier movies tended to focus on a single character (or two) and a series of key moments in their existence, and what impact they had on the character's mental state or, indeed, life (think Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and Casino). Goodfellas follows the same structure, progressing in a chronological fashion but only showing events worth documenting. It makes the film feel like less of a narrative and more of a biopic, but certainly dosen't detract from the entertainment.Pesci is almost unanimously considered the standout, while the smaller-than-expected role played by De Niro makes one forget just how good an actor he really is. In fact, the very young Liotta almost seems overshadowed by his co-stars, despite being the lead actor. That is until the final Act, where he steals the show as a coked-up Henry, trying to get through the hectic day of a mobster while the rest of his life appears to crumble around him. His overt aggression and deep-seated paranoia contribute to his performance being the most realistic and poignant depiction of a person under the influence ever seen on film.Goodfellas consists of some of the most inspired cinematography and editing ever to be seen. Indeed, what makes the use of the camera such a delight to watch is that it is almost a character in itself, so much does it reflect the tone of each scene. When Henry is in a rush to get his date back home, the film cuts from point A to point B showing nothing in between, to maintain an urgent pace. When he takes Karen to the Copacabana for the first time, the camera follows her so that the viewer feels the same sense of unfamiliarity and surprise at just how good Henry's life is as she does.Finally, an excellent soundtrack perfectly compliments Henry's non-diegetic voice-over. Music by Tony Bennett, The Rolling Stones, Dean Martin, Donovan, Cream, Muddy Waters, The Who and Sid Vicious (and that's just scratching the surface) make enjoyable scenes memorable, and memorable scenes legendary. And while Goodfellas doesn't exactly promote peace on Earth and goodwill to your fellow man, I'll take it over The Search for Santa Paws any day of the festive season.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

"A story about a man's rise and fall as a ""goodfella"".","As a teenager Henry Hill's (Ray Liotta) dream begins to come true when he lands a spot during jobs for a local mob. To him, things can only go up from this point and they do. For awhile anyway.Eventually he is turned into a certified member of the mob family. He gets married and starts a family all while working for the mob. He hangs out with many different characters from his mob family, including mob boss Paulie (Paul Sorvina), Jimmy (Robert De Niro), and Tommy (Joe Pesci). As time goes on, Henry comes across a few rough patches.This movie is just an amazing movie. I've never been really into mob movies, but this one is just too good to pass up. Everything is great, the acting, the writing, just everything.The movie has a great cast of characters, all with dramatically different personalities brought together by the mob. Henry is the type that can act both innocent and deadly at the same time. Tommy is a true off the wall psychopath with a crazy sense of humor. Jimmy is you're typical gangster who can go from your best friend to your worst enemy in the blink of an eye.Martin Scorsese is by far one of the most talented directors of our time and this is one of his finest pieces of work. It's worth watching even if you're not much into mobster movies. Although, if you just have a problem with violence or mobsters in general, pass this one up.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Too HIGH on IMDb charts for my liking!,"I will divide my review into following 5 categories each accounting a maximum of 100%(if perfect) ________________________________________________________________Visual Pleasure:[75%] This is a classic mobster movie. I've seen quite a few mobster movies including all-time greats like Godfather 1,2; but i've never been visually pleased with them. They are all smooth but none of them visually stun me.Director's Work:[100%] Martin Scorsese is a legend. I feel everything he does is flawless. With this film again he has done an exceptional job. Any director couldn't have done anything more to make this film better.Acting:[100%] This is the best part of the movie. Every actor fits into his/her role perfectly. The execution and the dialogue delivery from all the actors was truly remarkable.Entertainment Value:[71%] This is the thing that let me down. I wasn't fully entertained by this movie and this factor contributes a lot in my rating. Sure there were some parts that I liked a lot but not as a whole. Maybe people who love Gangster movies will like it a lot more than I did.Script:[90%] The script was again very good. The narration and screenplay was also impressive.__________________________________________________________________My Advice: People who loved Godfather will love this one. Anyone out there looking for a well-acted and a well-directed film, this one is for you._____7.4/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
one of the best films of the decade,"Absorbing, pumped-up tale, based on real life incidents, beginning in the mid-1950s about an ambitious young man who grows up in a mafia-ridden neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. His parents may have high expectations for him, but unfortunately for them his only goal in life is to become a member of the mob. From the moment the movie starts it grabs and holds you with its riveting story, dark humor, memorable characters, colorful dialogue, over-the-top performances, and potent violence. Every member of this cast is superb, and Pesci is a real scene stealer. Runs around in the latter half and loses some of its impact, but overall a gripping, authentic, and startling look at life among mobsters. This is an unforgettable showing and really a must-see. ****",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"An Excellent,Flawless Masterpiece And Classic From Martin Scorsese And One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made.","Goodfellas is an excellent,flawless Masterpiece and a Classic and it's not only one of the greatest Gangster Films ever made and one of the greatest films of the 90's but also one of the greatest films ever made. Filled with masterful direction,excellent performances and a great soundtrack,Goodfellas is one of my all time favorite films and is Martin Scorsese and cinema at it's best.Set in New York,based on the true life book Wiseguy by Nicolas Pileggi and based on a true story,Goodfellas tells the story of Henry Hill(Ray Liotta)an Irish-Italian man who has had a love for Gangsters and gangster life since he was a teenager in his local neighborhood. As a youngster Henry starts working for the Mob and as a he gets older Henry becomes apart of the Mob and living the lifestyle of a gangster. Over the course of three decades Henry Hill along with his friends Jimmy The Gent Conway(Robert De Niro)and Tommy DeVito(Joe Pesci)depicts Henry's easy rise in the Mob and his hard and dangerous downfall.Right from the opening credits and all the way to the very end Goodfellas is a flawless masterwork of a film that pulls you end and does not let go until the final frame. Martin Scorsese has created a film that right next to Francis Coppola's The Godfather as the definitive Gangster film. But where as The Godfather was an epic and somewhat romantic view of gangster like and a Mob family,Goodfellas took a much different direction and gives viewers a darker,less romantic view of Mob showing viewers a world of how a Mobster lives his life as a gangster. What is different about Goodfellas is that the story tells the story from the point of view of the gangsters who works is not a Mob Boss or someone who runs a crime family but someone who works under the Mob bosses. One of the things I love about the film Goodfellas is the way Scorsese plays with the audience showing things from Henry Hill's point of view where from Hill's point of view the Mob is a great way of living and a easy way to make money and live the good life showing the glamour,suits and cars making audiences love the lifestyle. But Scorsese tricks audiences and shows us that Gangster and Mob life can be a dangerous and violent way of living where you can either be killed or sent to prison. Scorsese gives the film a since of dread where there is violence in the air and that being in the Mob is not all it's cracked up to be. Some Films based on true stories while good are most of the time told in a straight forward fashion and if Goodfellas had been in the hands of another filmmaker it would have been more of a straight forward true story but Scorsese being the master filmmaker that he is fills the film with great scenes and moments that are iconic and memorable and Scorsese keeps you glued to the screen engrossed by the film and making you want more making Goodfellas one of the greatest true stories on film. The screenplay by Scorsese and Pileggi is impressive giving the film excellent dialog and scenes with great realism and edge making you as the viewer feel like you are in the scenes with the characters. Goodfellas is one of the fastest 2 and a half hours you will ever go through because when the film starts it never slows down and let's you breath a sigh of relief. The pace is so rapid and quick you will feel like you are watching a 90 minute film rather than a two and a half hour one. I think it's because of the documentary and raw feel of the film and how we as the viewer are in the movie. Goodfellas is like a Rock N'Roll record put on film where you are looking and listening. The main characters in the film are not what you would call likable,but are well-developed and there is times when you can relate to them and you see things from their point of view and you get pulled into their state of minds. The ending and final 20-30 minutes is a classic ending filled with suspense and paranoia that is pushed to the max. It's an ending you will not forget.The cast does excellent jobs in their roles. Ray Liotta is amazing in his career defining role as Henry Hill,with Liotta bringing intensity and wild energy to the role. Robert De Niro is excellent and at his best as Jimmy Conway,with De Niro being menacing and unforgettable. Joe Pesci is brilliant in his Oscar winning role as the volatile Tommy DeVito,with Pesci being scary,intense and funny at the same time. Lorraine Bracco is riveting as Karen Hill,Henry's wife. Bracco has great chemistry with Liotta. Paul Sorvino is captivating and suave as Paulie,the boss over everybody. Frank Vincent is wonderful as Billy Batts,a made guy from Tommy's past. Frank Sivero(Frankie Carbone),Chuck Low(Morris),Michael Imperioli(Spider),Debi Mazer(Sandy),Gina Mastrogiacomo(Janice)and Catherine Scorsese(Tommy's Mother)give good performances as well. Also lookout for an early role by Samuel L. Jackson in the role of Stacks.The direction by Martin Scorsese is masterful and brilliant,with Scorsese always moving the camera and giving the film a great pace and visual style. Great direction by Scorsese.The soundtrack in the film is one of best soundtracks in movie history with classics by The Rolling Stones(Gimmie Shelter,Monkey Man),Donovan(Atlantis),The Crystels(Then He Kissed Me),Cream(Sunshine Of Your Love),The Who(Magic Bus),Harry Nilsson(Jump Into The Fire),Sid Vicious(My Way),Bobby Darin(Beyond The Sea),Aretha Franklin(Baby I Love you),Eric Clapton,Derek and The Dominoes(Layla,Piano Exit),George Harrison(What Is Life)and more. Excellent soundtrack.In final word,if you love Martin Scorsese,Gangster films,Crime Dramas or films in general,I highly suggest you see Goodfellas,a timeless Masterpiece and Classic that you can watch again and again and should be in every film lover's collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
interesting twist on mob-life,"There are several good plot synopses up already, so I'll avoid that and just say what I liked and didn't about it. Maybe the few people who haven't seen it will appreciate this.So apparently this is the one that re-started fascination with the mob. I like how different it was from Godfather. They say it influenced the Sopranos. I can see a little of that, but to me is just not quite as satisfying.Liotta, Brocco, Pesci and the rest of the gang are all great in this movie. It's cool because of Henry--Liotta--'s outside perspective. I dig how it's not exactly easy being a mobster either. It's never quite as glamorous as it seems, and on top of that, the crazy fellas who are in that business are crazy enough to turn on you at any time. Pesci's famous ""Funny how?...Am I a clown? Do I amuse you?"" is classic for good reason.Still, Scorsese has this weird obsession with making at least the last 45 minutes seem like a video for 70s AM radio greatest hits. It really gets in the way of the movie for me...big time. (I'm a musician by trade, so I love music. It's not a prejudice. The songs chosen here are all cool songs too, just way too loud and pervasive.) The big lessons aren't quite so big in this one either. That's fine, but you expect a little more from this crew. On the other hand, maybe that should be seen as refreshing. And in a lot of ways it is.I would recommend it for anyone who wants a lighter mob movie, and one that seems oddly more realistic because of the domestic issues. Also, the time frame helps it stand out in a cool way. It's very good, no doubt.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Iconic and my personal favourite movie of all time.,"Goodfellas is a movie that if it came out yesterday it would be just as relevant and impressive. It has stood the test of time and is still the greatest mobster movie, surpassing The Godfather in my opinion, and I would argue is the greatest movie of all time. The back-way restaurant scene still works beautifully and has I have seen it repeated and mimicked constantly. A must watch for any movie lover. Martin Scorsese has had an amazing career with other fantastic films such as The Departed, Gangs of New York, Casino, Raging Bull, and Taxi Driver. It is not a coincidence that Robert DeNiro has appeared in 4 of these as he has been excellent in all of them starting with Mean Streets. His peak was arguably Goodfellas as well as Ray Liotta who has had trouble duplicating his success of the years. With such an impressive filmography, for Goodfellas to stand out among them really proves just how amazing it was. A must watch for a Scorsese fan, DeNiro fan, Liotta fan, mobster fan, and a movie fan.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Perfection,"This is a flawless movie. Not a damn thing wrong with it. It's awfully hard for me to pick a favorite movie but if I had to, this one would be up there battling for the top spot. Martin Scorsese again proves to all doubters that he is the master. When it comes to making an urban saga, you can't top Scorsese. It's futile to even try. From the first frame of the movie, you're sucked in and vacum sealed until the credits are over. Everything is top notch. Joe Pesci gives one of the most memorable performances in screen history. He takes what could have been a cliched, one dimensional character and gives him life. Underneath all his boasts and jokes you can see a truly insane man waiting for something to set him off. It's scary just to watch him on the screen. You think he's gonna step out and smack you around. It's a damn shame that he hasn't made a movie since Leathal Weapon 4. This movie was so good that Scorsese practically remade it with Casino. To watch a master at work and see the best film of the 90's, watch Goodfellas.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Crime or Consequence,"Martin Scorsese's 'Goodfellas' (1990) is a masterclass in storytelling, bringing to life the gritty reality of the mob lifestyle with unparalleled authenticity. The film kicks off with a narrative style that is both engaging and informative, thrusting the viewer into the world of organized crime through the eyes of Henry Hill, played by Ray Liotta. Scorsese's direction is meticulous, weaving a tale that is as enthralling as it is unnerving.The narrative structure of 'Goodfellas' is a standout, employing a non-linear approach that adds depth and complexity to the story. The film's pacing is exceptional, balancing intense action sequences with quieter, more introspective moments. This allows the viewer to fully immerse themselves in the lives and psyches of the characters.Thematically, 'Goodfellas' delves deep into the allure and eventual downfall of the mob lifestyle. It explores themes of loyalty, power, and the corrupting influence of greed with a nuance that is rarely seen in crime dramas. The film doesn't glorify the mob life; instead, it presents it in a raw and unfiltered manner, showing both the highs and the devastating lows.Technically, 'Goodfellas' is a triumph. The cinematography by Michael Ballhaus is visually stunning, capturing the essence of the era and the claustrophobic nature of the criminal underworld. The use of long takes, particularly in the famous Copacabana scene, is not just a show of technical prowess but also serves to draw the viewer deeper into the world Scorsese has created. The soundtrack, an eclectic mix of period-specific hits, further enhances the film's authenticity and emotional impact.On a personal note, what sets 'Goodfellas' apart for me is its raw portrayal of its characters. Liotta's portrayal of Henry Hill is both charismatic and haunting, while Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci deliver performances that are both terrifying and mesmerizing. The film doesn't shy away from the brutal realities of its subject matter, making it a gripping and at times unsettling experience.After watching this film, one burning question lingered in my mind: Who really holds sway over our world-Crime or Consequence? While the allure of criminality may seem alluring, 'Goodfellas' subtly suggests that it's the repercussions of our actions that ultimately define our fate.In conclusion, 'Goodfellas' is more than just a crime movie; it's a detailed tapestry of life within the mafia, told with the skill and authenticity that only Scorsese could provide. Its impact on the genre is undeniable, and its influence can be seen in numerous films that followed. This film is a must-watch for not only fans of the genre but for anyone who appreciates masterful filmmaking.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"Tell, don't show!","If stream of consciousness, ""tell, don't show"" storytelling is your thing, you'll probably love this movie. It might be the laziest film I have ever seen. Don't get me wrong, I love Martin Scorsese; The Departed is on my Top 5 movies. But this movie somehow fell short in almost every way I can imagine. I honestly don't understand how it is rated so highly.The only thing it got right was the time period-set design, costume, cars, period acting- all of that was on point. Everything else felt... just off. The acting was over the top, storytelling was jarring and totally out of pace for the characters, especially considering their supposed ages at any given time relative to each other and themselves. They say someone is 21 but they look 35. I think DeNiro's character was supposed to be in his 20's at one point but he looks 40. It just gets worse from there-trying to keep everyone's age difference in line as the story progresses because they all look the same age.And the narration. JUST. WON'T. STOP. And it's not even one character telling the story. That I could understand. Not forgivable. But I could understand that. Characters just randomly start narrating their thoughts out of nowhere. It's a jarring whiplash storytelling method of which I have never seen/heard and can't for the life of me figure out.When a character needs to explain how they're feeling: NARRATION! When the audience might not understand someone's motives: NARRATION! If there's even the slightest doubt that someone might have motives other than what you see on screen: NARRATION! So don't worry, the filmmaker will make sure you never feel anything other than what they want you to feel at any given moment through, you guessed it: NARRATION!I get what the narration is, to some degree; It's a distraction from the reality of what's really taking place. It's a deception of what we're seeing on screen, I think. To the audience, if you can drown them with narration over substance, perhaps they will find the overall end result exquisite. Hit them with thougts and platitudes and drop the finale on them as character development. It's like, ""See, they came a long way from where they were before because their thought process changed"". Only, the writers couldn't figure out how to naturally incorporate their thoughts and emotions, so they gave them pages of narration.There were so many scenes that characters had the perfect opertunity to express their thoughts and feeling in a natural way through dialogue in the scene or just through simple expression, and yet here they were, waxing ineloquent on the inner goings on of their minds. I'm sure this has something to do with it being adapted from a book, but I don't think that's a valid excuse for any film, much less a Scorsese one.Narration aside, the acting was severely over the top, especially by Pesci and Liotta. There were several scenes where their characters seemed to play off of each others overacting to the detriment of the overall tone of the story. Some things just didn't make sense, like stabbing a guy multiple times to kill him and then shooting him. Why not just shoot him? Or just stab him? Shooting him was going to draw attention to their location so it made no sense. Things like this stand out in a movie that prides itself on realism and I simply find it goofy and boring.Overall, I found this movie nearly unwatchable due to the lazy storytelling and narration. Even the narrators themselves lacked emotion leaving me feeling numb to the story and characters. It was like they were begging me to ignore them. So I did.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

May always be my favourite movie,"I feel drawn to give Goodfellas a review right now, likely because it's been approximately a decade since I first watched it, and also because it turns 30 this year (oh, and Scorsese's fantastic The Irishman has been on my mind a whole lot since I saw it a few months back). I loved Goodfellas the first time I watched it, and on every rewatch I've given it in the past 10 years, it's only gotten better and better. I could watch it every year or two and I don't think I'd ever get tired of it.Of course when a film this great is loved by so many people, what can I say about it that's interesting or fresh? All I can really do is add my voice to the already existing sea of people praising Goodfellas and offer my opinion that yeah, it really is that good. It deserves its classic status despite not being as old as we'd maybe usually consider a 'classic,' as well as despite of the fact that it really doesn't feel old at all. The main thing that dates Goodfellas is that we know it's old because of how much younger still recognisable stars like DeNiro and Pesci look now.Speaking of DeNiro and Pesci: they're both absolutely fantastic. DeNiro is a little more understated here than he is in some of his best and most hard-hitting performances (namely Raging Bull and Taxi Driver, two other great Scorsese films), but Pesci delivers the role of his career here. He's fantastic: so terrifying and despicable, but also funny and bizarrely human. I think the relationship with his mother (played by Scorsese's adorable real life mum) humanises him to a degree, and Pesci does such a great job at showing why everyone around his character fears and respects him that I think some of that rubs off on you as an audience member. You can't help but like him while you also hate him.Ray Liotta deserves praise too, as he largely carries the movie, and despite not quite being a big star on the same level as DeNiro or Pesci, he really is just as good here, and delivers a performance as good as those two give. His voiceover narration is also one of my favourites out of any film I've ever watched. Lorraine Bracco is also great, and it's good to get a surprisingly compelling female perspective on the mob lifestyle. She's something of an audience surrogate, so well-implemented you might not even realise it at first; her mix of horror and awe at the life she finds herself in I think mirrors what most of us would feel if put into a similar situation. I'm glad she also got a chance to shine throughout The Sopranos too, because she's an immensely talented actress that although having those two great roles, probably deserved better.The rest of the cast could well be worth mentioning too, but then we'd be here forever. Even minor supporting characters with one or two lines are incredibly memorable (Jimmy Two Times, Jimmy Two Times!!) And then I could go on and on about the amazing soundtrack, with every single song choice being absolutely perfect and adding so much energy. And then there's Thelma Schoonmaker's editing, and based on her track record with Scorsese, these two complement each other so well. In all honesty, the editing in Goodfellas is not only Schoonmaker's best work, it might well be one of the best edited movies of all time- the pacing is perfect, and two and a half hours flies by yet without anything feeling rushed or hasty. And Scorsese... he'll always be one of my favourite filmmakers, and I love that even now he's still giving it his all and making great films (his last three as of the time of writing, The Wolf of Wall Street, Silence, and the aforementioned The Irishman were all great and amongst the best of their respective years). Still, Goodfellas might well be his best work. Everything feels so complete and right and perfectly put together. It is an impeccably well crafted film, with every shot, every camera movement, every editing trick, every song, and every line of dialogue adding something and making the film as good as it can be.I always find myself in awe of films when they're as good as this one. The compliments I could throw at this movie may well be endless, but in less than 1000 words here I've probably said enough, especially given it's not hard to find other people who love this movie who've already said much of what I've said and then some. It's absolutely worth a watch if you haven't gotten around to it yet for whatever reason, and even if you have, it's just as worthy of a rewatch. Like I said, from personal experience, I notice something new and gain a new sense of appreciation for it every time I revisit it. It's inspiring and wonderful that a film this great can exist, and it will stick with me and surely remain a personal favourite of mine until the day I die.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

The wise guys,"""Goodfellas"" is Martin Scorsese's movie about Henry Hill, who aspires to be a gangster from an early age and becomes involved with an Italian-American crime family over three decades. The film features interesting and effective cinematography and it was notable how the shots were filmed in the ""drugs"" portion of the film. The soundtrack featured a number of notable songs like the end of ""Layla"" and ""Jump Into the Fire"".The performances in this film are top-notch. Ray Liotta plays Henry Hill effectively as he lives with the perks and dangers of mob life. Robert De Niro delivers an interesting and refined performance as Jimmy Conway. Joe Pesci is memorable as the erratic and disturbing Tommy DeVito. Lorraine Bracco is also commendable as Henry's wife and Paul Sorvino makes a convincing mob boss.This film develops an interesting story with surprising and interesting developments that keep the film well-paced. It explores the tightly contained lives of the members of the mob family. In addition, it has an interesting examination of the privileges afforded to the mob and the consequences of the mob's power. Also explored are the implications of mob life for Henry's relationship with his wife. ""Goodfellas"" is an exceptional entry into the crime film genre.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
A modern popularist classic,"First and foremost, much as many so-called film conosieurs would like to think, Martin Scorsese is not an underground name anymore - and Goodfellas marked his departure from exclusive to mainstream alternative.Try to forget the urban chique that now surrounds Goodfellas and watch with a mind to experience the visceral nature of this brilliant film.  Don't think of it on terms of whats 'cool' or what 'happens'; but why and how these events are occuring.Just try to experience Goodfellas from the perpective it was intended -of Henry Hill, not of a comfortable arm chair perspective where what is, in fact sickening violence and abuse, can appear as glorified and entertaining. Imagine it was you who were at risk and apply this to Scorsese's in-your-face-approach.Joe Pesci is amazing in this film, and once again DeNiro commands each and every moment he does not share with Pesci, with total charisma and power.The benchmark to which many Scorsese and other gangster films will be measured, for years to come, and a certified part of popular culture.Stunning.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Add to that Robert DeNiro with one of his classic performances and Joe Pesci who steals every scene he is in, combined with the beautiful cinematography and top notch direction and you get one of the best movies ever and a film that rang in the 90's as a decade that produced numerous cinema hits and classics.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"Best Film of the Nineties, scratch that, best Film ever!","This movie was so incredibly well made and even though it did not win best picture there are GoodFellas Fanatics (like myself) while Dances With the Wolves has faded from out memories. The movie goes through the life of Henry Hill (Liotta). It starts off with Hill as a child who ""would rather be a gangster than the president of the United States"" We meet Tommy (Pesci) Jimmy Conway (Robert Deniro) who would root for the bad guys in the movies. We meey Pauly (Sorvino), and the whole gangster family: ""Jimmy 'Two Times' who got his name because he said everything twice. 'I'm gonna go get the papers, get the papers."" This movie is funny at times but not haha funny. The movie has Romance, Drama, and oh yes the genre Scorcese perfected, ""Crime""",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Great Mafia Flick,"This is possibly the best Mafia movie you could ever see. Ray Liotta, in one of his best roles, narrates throughout the movie, and it works wonderfully. This movie tries to show the true feeling of being a gangster; you never know who your friends are, and never trust anyone. De Niro is good, Pesci is good, and the direction by Scorcese is good. This movie is hard, cold and cruel. It's highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Like,"In general, everything is fine in the film: the setting, the performance of great actors, and the work of the cameraman. I already wrote about the director, he is the best in this sense!This film is very good even now, and even in the 90s it was just a masterpiece. So if you haven't watched it yet, then don't pay attention to when it was filmed, feel free to watch it. It will still be a pleasure to watch today. There is no doubt about this.It is very interesting to look from the inside at what was really going on in the world of gangsters, realizing that these are not fictions and not fantasies. It's impossible to take your eyes off the screen. In fact, there are not very many such worthy films about the mafia, and ""Goodfellas"" occupies one of the first places among films of this genre. The most remarkable thing in the picture is that we are also shown simple human feelings and relationships, which is why we want to revise it again and again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Absolutely brilliant,"Martin Scorsese has made some of the most enduring American films of the last 30 years, and Goodfellas still stands one of his very best. Arguably the best film of the 90's,Goodfellas delivers laughs, thrills, shocks, and a great soundtrack of pop music ranging three decades. As with any Scorsese film, the acting is top-notch, especially from Liotta and Academy Award winner Pesci. And as with any Scorsese film, there's brutal violence abound. Goodfellas is definitely one of the best gangster films ever, and it's also a vivid look into an era that once was. On top of all that, it's my all-time favorite film. You can't ask for anything else from a movie than what Scorsese's masterpiece delivers. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Best film Scorsese's made yet and probably ever will,"I come back to watching this film every few years and each time I watch it, it gets better and better. This was Martin Scorsese at his best.You can debate all you want about his early films, Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, Mean Streets... they don't hold up to this one. It's as if Scorsese's got everything rolling on this one - seamless editing transitions, intelligent use of soundtrack, clever camera work, sharp script, nuanced acting ... this film had everything he had to give.In many ways, it makes me kinda sad to see how the quality of so many of Scorsese's films have tanked since. Oh, the critics will love the movie he churns out every now and then but really they usually stink.(I mean, films like Kundun - big yawner, Gangs of New York - a documentary disguised as a fiction film, Age of Innocence - enervating drama of manners) Casino is probably the only exception - it's a decent film.It's frightening how a director can slide downhill so fast.So, enjoy this film if you can. Rent it. Buy it. Watch it. Re-watch it. You'll not see a better Scorsese film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Slick and clever,"I found this movie too cute.  The characters are brightly colored but not especially complex.  It's nothing more than nihilistic comedy, albeit done with amazing skill.  The movies that deserve ratings of 9 and 10 engage more of the range of our emotions than this does.  This shortcoming probably has to do with the somewhat eager camera and lighting that put every scene at the same emotional distance from the viewer.Frequent violence and cursing do not have to be objectionable in a film, but here they often seem wanton or voyeuristic.Perhaps rather than ""cute"" I should say ""deft"" or ""neat"" or ""pat"".  At any rate, this is not on a par with The Godfather, and I gave it a 7.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Stylistic And highly compelling film,If someone were to ask you what is Goodfellas' plot what could you say ? On the surface it's the story of Henry Hill but its not really so much about Henry Hill or any other individual or event. Rather it is a cross section of the gangster lifestyle. Henry Hill's narration is directed towards the audience as if he's talking to them personally recounting his story.Joe Pesci earned a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role in the film and while he did a good job playing a psychopath-even garnering the praise of Hill-I couldn't help but feel he was slightly miscast due to his small stature. There is no major flaw however with Robert DeNiro's performance which I found the best in the picture.By no means is Goodfellas the seventeenth best movie ever made it is still a compelling film and one of Scorsese's best.,10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster","One of the best Gangster films of all time. The film follows Henry Hill as he rises through the ranks from nobody to 'wise-guy', and all the struggles he has along the way with friends, family, and the police. Based on a true story (some say at least 90% accurately) this Martin Scorsese film casts Ray Liotta as Henry Hill, supported by Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and impressively Lorraine Bracco - Hill's much troubled wife. The dialogue is brilliant, the pacing of the film is exceptional, action is gritty and raw, in fact the whole film is a masterclass in film making. It's fascinating to watch lives lived to excess, but this in itself is fascinating as the audience is treated to a study of social behaviour in American gangster culture. As cool as they want and aim to be, the main players are always just one rat away from being caught, one bullet away from being shot, one wrong move away from the law.Backed up by a fantastic score and soundtrack the entire cinematography is an experience to behold. Within the 140+ min film you will encounter 200+ F-bombs, there are drugs, there is violence, so I would not recommend watching this with kids or sensitive grandparents. This is easily one of my favourite gangster films and considering it's 1990 release date this film has stood the test of time and is still as impacting today as it was when I first watched it.

Outstanding screenplay (or novel) but flat directing (rental),"When i read the book, i was illuminated by the way it sticks to the golden rule of great stories: unusual character in a unusual place - -- so at the core it's about a teen telling that becoming a criminal is the best occupation in the world at a time when those Goodfellas owned indeed the city... It was an extraordinary inside view of the underworld during the years that follows what was depicted in the Godfather...About the movie, it's a good thing that the author worked on the screenplay and it's true that the narrator comments are nearly what was written... However i found that Scorcese fails to bring a visual punch in his scenes... sometimes it looks like an illustrated tale, other times, the key moments are plain because key facts have been omitted (essentially that they were always on the run to invent new scheme, that they were powerful because they corrupt a lot and that JFK was their store..) and honestly, he fails to properly build a tension! The cast is good and those background team found there the part of their career but in no way, RDN can pass for a Irish man... So the movie exists only by its original screenplay and its talented cast but if you look for a real punch, prefer the book instead!",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Scorsese is overrated,"Like the movie itself Scorsese is like the godfather of Hollywood, nobody dare criticise him or Deniro, life imitates art like a film metaphor for their real places in elite Hollywood.

A depressing nasty movie where the main character continually does awful things, where the good characters are repeatedly punished while cruel horrible people are rewarded, wow so gritty and unrewarding to watch, overrated movie, overrated director, bad storyline. Who cares if it's true why even make this movie, I ended up just watching it for the murder scenes and even then saw a couple dead characters blink or breathe and take me out of it, and the more characters die the less the movie matters just gets to the point of like whatever kill them all who cares, just so overrated. Giving 3 stars for the production quality and acting but maybe these guys are just playing themselves maybe they're all nasty in real life, considering Deniro is mates with Marina Abramovic the self proclaimed dark witch it seems like this whole movie has more to it in reality.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
A gripping tale of a mafia life,"As far back as he could remember Henry Hill wanted to be a gangster. He got his wish and in GoodFellas we get to go along for the exciting ride. Before the opening titles have even concluded we get a clear sense of the very dangerous yet oddly thrilling lives Henry and his fellow gangsters lead. And the sense of excitement and wonder is maintained right up until the bitter end.Ray Liotta is the nominal lead in his role as Henry from whose point of view the story is told. While Liotta is fine in his role Joe Pesci as Tommy DeVito and Robert De Niro as Jimmy Conway are even better. The boundless energy and manic temper Pesci brings to Tommy are absolutely perfect. Pesci's performance in the now-famous ""I'm funny how?"" scene is acting at its best. De Niro's performance is more subtle but also brilliant and his portrayal of Jimmy brings a sense of menace whenever he appears. Even though he is for the most part restrained, you know he is fully capable of exploding at any moment. Also giving fine performances are Lorraine Bracco as Henry's wife, Karen, and Paul Sorvino as the quiet, mysterious, yet undeniably powerful mob boss Paul Cicero.GoodFellas depicts the rise and fall of Henry Hill in his life in the mafia. We follow him from his beginnings as a simple Brooklyn youth through dizzying highs and maddening lows. Henry is in effect telling his own story here through Liotta's voice-over narration and this device works well, filling in some blanks, helping to move the story along and also giving some insight into the motivations which drive his actions. We also get some insight from Karen's point of view as sporadic Bracco narration sheds some light on how a simple, naive girl gets swept up in the mob life.The unique Martin Scorsese touch also adds a great deal to the experience. So many sequences are brilliantly conceived and perfectly executed. None is more memorable than the truly brilliant tracking shot where for over three unbroken minutes we follow Henry and Karen from the street outside the Copacabana nightclub down through the bowels of the club and right up to the front of the stage. Few directors would even imagine such a sequence much less be able to pull it off so wonderfully. Scorsese's use of music is also pitch-perfect as he seems to always be able to find just the right song to perfectly frame each moment. And as would be expected with Scorsese nothing is spared in terms of violence or language. Henry Hill and those around him led ruthless, violent, dangerous lives and Scorsese captures that wonderfully. Proceeding at its own pace, GoodFellas allows you to really get to know and appreciate these characters. Some might quibble and say things move along too slowly, that the pace could be picked up. But there is no denying that, overall, GoodFellas is absolutely terrific.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
The best gangster movie of all 9/10,"From the first words Henry Hill says at the opening sequence of ""Goodfellas"" you are immediately attached to the movie. The classic story of gangsters rising to power in America just to fall apart. This kind of plot has repeated itself many times before in other gangster movies: ""blow"", ""casino"", ""the Irishman"" and more. But Martin Scorsese nailed it the best. The movie has became since then a pop culture movie and a ""must watch"" film for all those who are film buffs. The characters are simply amazing and classic: Ray Liotta does a great work with his character and tells his story with expression and voice over, Robert DeNiro is awesome, he is the perfect actor for playing a mob gangster along with Pacino. Joe Pesci steals the show with his performance and has the best lines in the entire movie. Also many of the actors in the film became later on actors on the show ""The Sopranos"". The soundtrack is great. My favorite sequence is the one with the song ""layla"" by Derek and the Dominos. Overall this is one of Scorsese's best films along with ""Taxi Driver"" and ""The Departed"". Most people will remember this film for its catchy tone and how attempting it is.

Marvelous production values,"There is a lot to like and appreciate in GoodFellas, Marty's cinematic Behemoth, insofar as some scenes belong (rightfully) to the most iconic cinema moments. And I'd argue that this is exactly the film's principal adversary. Make no mistake, this is still a thoroughly enjoyable film, but some of its parts, especially those of which concern Joe Pesci's explosive Tommy DeVitto reach such lofty heights that the other segments look like hollows to them, resulting in a film with a shaky flow: some extremely memorable moments to indulge in, and some scenes you might desire to somehow skip.Another thing that needs to be spoken of is the sheer brilliance of the film's production values, costumes, songs, and overall attention to details. Scorsese uses everything Hollywood industry has to offer here, to make a world not unlike DeMille and Griffith's works.

It's not long for the sake of being long, it's long because it's the only way this movie could have worked.The whole cast is amazing in this, but I really want to shoutout Martin Scorsese because this is possibly his magnum opus and it deserved more appreciation at award season than it was given.

Beyond excellent,"Goodfellas is an unforgettable crime drama directed by Martin Scorsese. The film delves into the shadows of crime, exploring themes of friendship, betrayal, and the complexity of life as it follows the rise and fall of a young man entering the mafia world.Themes of friendship and betrayal are deeply explored in the film. The main character, Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), values friendship and loyalty as he enters the mafia world, yet he also confronts the dangers of betrayal and mistrust.

The fast-paced progression of events unveils the underbelly of the criminal world while maintaining the story's gripping quality.Portraying the characters' inner worlds enriches the film further. Ray Liotta's performance adeptly captures Henry Hill's transition from an ordinary life to the mafia world and his inner conflicts. The performances of Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are also remarkable. De Niro's portrayal of Jimmy Conway helps us understand the fine line between loyalty and betrayal, while Pesci's Tommy DeVito reflects a dangerous and explosive personality.The film realistically depicts the allure and dangers of the criminal underworld. Scorsese's directing style creates a harsh and authentic atmosphere, and the music choices reflect the spirit of the time.Goodfellas offers a profound exploration of friendship, betrayal, crime, and the complexity of human nature.

There will never be another Goodfellas,"Goodfellas is a one of a kind film. That feels kind of strange to write considering that this film has been repeatedly attempted to be copied. The narration, the fourth wall breaks, the over-the-top violence; it all seems like a cliché in the ""true-crime"" genre. Blow, Casino, The Wolf of Wall Street, Donnie Brasco and many more films have tried to capture the same essence that Goodfellas had back when it was released in 1990. But, in this film-lover's humble opinion, they have all failed. That's because Goodfellas holds a style and atmosphere all of its own. But in the minds of the Hollywood ""big-wigs"", if something works once then it must work a dozen more times. Which is why every year we get an eye-rolling remake of a movie that was just fine when it came out. As I am typing this a remake of the 1959 classic Ben-Hur is about to be released. A film that won a record eleven Oscars is being remade! And, needless to say,many, including myself, do not think this film will hold up in comparison to its predecessor. Anyways, I think that the same thing is happening with Goodfellas in a more indirect way. I don't think that it will ever be remade frame-by- frame, but stylistically, it has been remade a dozen times, including a few times by Scorsese himself. It feels like every time Scorsese releases a new film it is trying to top Goodfellas, but no matter how good his films get, they never do. Goodfellas is his crowning achievement and it always will be. Because you can't remake Goodfellas, you can only come close. The acting, the camera movement, the cinematography, the lighting, the writing, and the overall unapologetic grit all come together to make a cinematic masterpiece and one of the best crime films of all time. I'm not saying that this film is better than The Godfather, but if you made that argument, many film-buffs would have a hard time debating you. Joe Pesci's Oscar- winning performance is just one of the many great highlights of this film. Jaw-dropping aggression, unchained violent nature, and unmercifully abhorrent personality highlight the surrealistically vicious world of Henry Hill (played by Ray Liotta). That and his narration which sounds more like reminiscence rather than straight-forward storytelling. Henry Hill describes his time in the mob in a musing tone as if to show admiration for his sinful past-life. Say what you will about how the true story actually relates to the film, but there is no denying that this film captured the spirit of Henry Hill and the mafia lifestyle. And that's what a good film based on a true story does. A biographic film is by no means a frame-by- frame record of every factual event that happened in an individual's life, but rather an homage that sums up that person's life and what impact it had on other people. Even if it was a negative impact, it can still make for a d****-good story. I could write about this movie for a hundred more paragraphs talking about Scorsese's decision in camera movement, the amazing performances given by the various actors and actresses (Robert De Niro, Ray Liota, Lorraine Bracco, Frank Vincent, even Samuel Jackson's small role), the way that the screenwriter, Nicholas Pileggi, nailed the character narration, fourth wall breaks, and witty dialogue just right, and a bunch of other elements that bring this film together so beautifully. But, to be honest, you wouldn't want to read that much text anyways. So, I will leave it up to the film to show you what I mean. And if you haven't seen this film yet, STOP READING THIS AND WATCH IT NOW. Seeing it is always better than talking about. You won't regret it. Even if you do, you can still be glad that it was made. Without Goodfellas, there would be no Sopranos, Boardwalk Empire, Pulp Fiction and any of your favorite TV shows or movies that were influenced by this movie. Goodfellas isn't just a film, it helped make film what it is today.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"'As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster'","This quote opens the movie, based on the true story of Henry Hill, who came from an half irish and half italian family that lived in a bad neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, in 1955. Since his boyhood he has always been fascinated from the mafia life, a life of power, brightness and murderers. He will find in Pauly Cicero and his organisation the family he always desired, a family of good guys, 'Goodfellas', as they loved to call themselves, but behind that term there is a world full of violence that Scorsese manages to tell us in a masterly way, as the violence grows with the age of the main character, who in the end will have to choose one between his two family. Not only a good movie, as his title may suggest, but a Masterpiece of the gangster movies, Goodfellas is in fact a dramatic story that becomes absolut enterteinement to the audience, without never suounding banal, with a fantastic soundtrack, which can count on great tracks like 'Il cielo in una stanza', an italian song by Mina, and the presence of brilliant actors like Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci (who won an oscar for playing the role of Tommy DeVito) and last but not least Robert De Niro, who needs no words to be described.

"Still feels fresh, energetic and innovative 24 years on","During one of the many thrilling montage sequences littered throughout one of Martin Scorsese's most revered films, gangster Henry Hill arrives home at Christmas time with a giant white and tacky Christmas tree and announces ""I got the most expensive tree they had!"". This sums up the colourful characters that inhabit Goodfellas, cheap, trashy thugs who hold more value to material possessions with hefty price-tags than human life. It has been criticised for glamorising these criminal types, all sharp, shiny suits, slick hair and big cars, and it's easy to get lost amongst the glitz and lifestyle. But although Scorsese alludes to the appeal of this live-fast way of life, he doesn't have much sympathy for its characters, and rightly so. Henry Hill may be the protagonist, our window into this world of high-rolling mafioso, but when he's stripped of his 'friends' and cash, he's not much more than a coke-addled rat.Ever since he was a little kid, Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) always wanted to be a gangster. In his blue-collar, Irish Brooklyn neighbourhood, he begins by parking cadillacs for local gangsters, and eventually starts to work for Jimmy 'The Gent' Conway (Robert De Niro). As the years go by, Henry, Jimmy and Italian-American loose-canon Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) form a small crew hijacking trucks and carrying out heists. Henry marries a wild and beautiful Jewish girl named Karen (Lorraine Bracco), and things seem peachy under the watch of boss Paulie (Paul Sorvino). But when Henry starts selling cocaine under the disapproving Paulie's nose, his world begins to crumble and he can no longer trust his friend, and the ugly side of the gangster business rears its head.Looking back at his early works such as Mean Streets (1973) and his documentary short Italianamerican (1974), there was always a sense of authenticity in Scorsese's Italian-American-focused work. All the talk now so clearly associated with Italian-Americans was practically invented by the director, and became so influential it now seems cliché and stereotyping. But Scorsese came from these types of neighbourhoods, and this rubs off on Goodfellas. This world seems so unreal - a world where a character can be beating money out of someone one minute, and then being sent champagne by a famous crooner the next - yet it comes alive in Scorsese's hands. The much-celebrated Steadicam sequence has been much imitated, but it still retains its crown. You get washed away amongst it all just like Karen.The film simply catapults you through it's story, showing snippets of gangster life through some breathtaking montages with voice-over narration. One minute Henry is enjoying new found love, sipping champagne while the glorious soundtrack plays in the background, the next he's on a paranoid and ill-fated drug deal. At the end I felt exhausted, like I'd just lived an entire life within 2 hours, and I've seen this film many times. But still, 24 years after it was made, it still feels fresh, energetic and innovative. Perhaps The Sopranos took its mantle when it took the gangster genre and made it a metaphor for American consumption, but it owes Goodfellas an overwhelming dose of gratitude. It also make it all the more tragic that Joe Pesci has retired from film, as his Oscar-winning performance and the final shot of him shooting at the camera a la The Great Train Robbery (1903) will linger long after the credits have rolled.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

The reason why is because it is essentially a culmination of all the themes and filmic styles he was working with prior to Goodfellas.

Unlike Casino and Gangs of New York, which were also great movies, Goodfellas has a sense of enjoyment and liveliness amidst all the carnage.After Goodfellas, Scorsese made plenty of great movies, but nothing he has done since, and prior to Goodfellas, reaches the pinnacle of this miraculous piece of filmmaking.Long live Scorsese!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Great Movie,"I think that this movie shows a great combination of the rise and fall of the American mafia and how drugs played a huge part in bringing it down. The movie seems to cover all aspects of being a made member in the mafia and the problems that arise between money and greed. It shows how most of these men are complete sociopaths and have no regard for human life. A lot of mob movies show the glamorous side of being a mobster, but Goodfellas also shows the darker sides of these men and their activities. The actors portrayed what a made man was like back in the 1950's perfect.

"Scorsese film with Robert De Niro , hardly the wrong , if it has already wrong.","Goodfellas is without doubt the masterpiece of Scorsese, and is one of the best mafia movie I've ever watched, one thing I liked in the film, was the duration, Scorsese not exaggerate the duration 2 hours and 25 minutes were perfect pro film, it not only helps in the rhythm, which does not leave the tiring film, and also not affect the script, which could be drawn, the cast is very good, Ray Liotta, this great Robert De Niro, excellent as always plus the character that I liked most was the Joe Pesci, he is cruel, and really intimidating, not to mention the impeccable of Pesci operation, the cast also has Lorraine Bracco, Paul Sorvino, Frank Vincent, Illeana Douglas and etc., the legal is that the parents of Martin Scorsese, part of the film, Catherine Scorsese and Charles Scorsese, the soundtrack is very good, the picture is very good, the costumes are great, I really enjoyed the first act, which shows the origin of the character Ray Liotta, plus the other two act are even better, Goodfellas is one of the best Mafia films, the best of Scorsese, I found this movie better than Dances With Wolfes, more does not mean that I found unfair the Oscar for the film Kevin Costner, because both are excellent.

One of the best films ever made,"I live in Emeryville, California (near SF, CA, which is more well known than Emeryville), and one of my favorite ways to spend a couple of hours is to head over to Everett&Jones for Ribs and watch Goodfellas. From the beginning, it draws you in to the mafia life following Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) rise from childhood dreams of being a gangster along with Jimmy Conway (Robert DeNiro), and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci in an amazing role). From the beginning, Scorsese captures the romance and logic of being a gangster. Young Henry Hill saw the beauty of it all. ""It was out of respect"" he says, when kids carried his mother's groceries all the way home for her. ""It was better than being president"", he says. And why not? Gangsters seemed immune to police, law, having to pay bills. That's the beauty that draws you in.Pesci plays the role of a hot-tempered gangster which is Robin Hood on-target. You can tell early on that this is a man who probably got stepped on when younger, and craved the respect given to gangsters. That makes him the most volatile of the trio since he constantly wants the respect from everyone, but sometimes doesn't command it.DeNiro is, not surprisingly, great as Jimmy Conway, but between the central role that Liotta has and the character Pesci plays, DeNiro's character doesn't really stand out. That's not to say DeNiro didn't play the character well, just that the nature of his character, IMO, wasn't meant to stick out.The music is a wonderful complement to the story. The fluid camera shots are amazing, especially after multiple viewings. There's one in particular where it follows Henry and Karen on their first real date. It's amazing. There's also another scene where the piano exit of Layla plays in the background. It's one of my favorites in the movie.Geez, what else can be said. Great acting by everyone. The story flows like water. The characters are drawn perfectly and have a depth. You feel the rationale of these gangsters and even find yourself siding with them. No scene is wasted.This is easily a 10/10, and to some extent, makes me rethink some other movies that I've rated a 9 or 10. Taking from Spinal Tap, this movie should be an 11. It is on my top 5 list of favorite movies. I liked it more than The Godfather (it's close, though). I've seen it a dozen times and it loses nothing with each subsequent viewing. If anything, it gains more and more of my admiration.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Better than The Godfather,"There, I said it. GoodFellas is better than The Godfather. The pace and excitement are a lot faster which makes it more engaging. They are similar in showing the gangster life as a mix of unpredictable violence and temporary glamour. However, GoodFellas focuses more on the perspective of one individual and how the lifestyle appealed to him as a child and onwards. The direction shows this perspective with great skill - there are many scenes imbued with great excitement, paranoia, fear and brutality. All of this adds up to a true to life depiction of what the American organised crime experience is like and how it ends.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Scorsese At His best,"I overreacted in saying that Casino was better than Goodfellas, that is not true. I just said that cause I heard people writing bad stuff about Casino and I didnt like that. They are both equally excellent. now I know why people say they are similar because they are both adapted screenplays from books with the same author. But it is two completely different places that they take place in.Goodfellas has a bunch of excellent performances. Joe Pesci is fantastic as a bad ass. Robert De Niro was also great, Liotta wasnt bad but he was overshadowed by the other two. Lorraine Braccos performance I think is overrated. This movie has a very well written script and deserved to win. Scorseses Direction is very well down in this movie.Now I think Scorsese should have won Best Director for this but the academy thought different. Now hes gonna win for Gangs of New York which is crap compared to Goodfellas. He will win for GONY cause they passed up the oppurtunity on Goodfellas and Raging Bull.

It's a film that is virtually flawless as there's not a single shot or edit that drags. There's nothing you could possibly change or clip from this final cut, you'd be hard pressed to nitpick anything wrong with this 2 and half hour classic.

The masters at work,"Goodfellas shows that you can put great actors and a great director together and make it work,even more so:Make a Masterpiece!My favorite director Martin Scorsese is teamed up with two of my favorite actors:Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. Add to that a great script,great dialogues and beautiful music and you get an all-time classic.The first scene of the movie shows that it won't be always easy to watch,but the violence is never over the top in this movie,although it is often gruesome.But then,Goodfellas isn't a movie about a tea party! The way that Scorsese mixes the scenes with period music is absolutely brilliant.He did it in Mean Streets and would do it again in his other Gangster Classic:Casino. Just look and listen when the scene comes up in which De Niro and Pesci brutally kick and punch a Maffia hood almost to his death.The song Atlantis by Donovan makes the scene even better and gives it an extra dimension.The story is well-known so I won't tell that,although it is very well put together and has no loose ends. Joe Pesci plays like never before,he only reached this same divine level in Casino and De Niro is brilliant as always.Ray Liotta is also very good here and it is a shame that he never surpassed or even reached the same level ever again.Although I think that the follow up,Casino,is an even better picture Goodfellas remains an all-time classic and it is a shame that it never won the Oscar(Best Picture or Best Director!!).

A Mob-Epic!,"There is a fascination with the underworld that exists in everyone. We find ourselves drawn to the headlines of gang wars and those caught in the middle. After all, Al Copone was a crook, but also a celebrity. It is this fascination that has captivated audiences with gangster pictures from the 1930s with James Cagney in ""The Public Enemy"" to the more recent ""Goodfellas"" from director Martin Scorsese. The latter picture, with its sense of realism, like ""The Public Enemy"" stands the test of time. Its characters are every bit as terrifying, especially Tommy De Vito played by Joe Pesci as was Cagney's portrayal of Tom Powers. And of course with Robert De Niro and Ray Liotta, one can only expect explosive portrayals.""Goodfellas"" tells the story of Henry Hill (Liotta), who from childhood had aspirations of being a gangster. He starts out small, parking Cadillacs for wise guys and eventually works his way up to top of the food chain. By the time he is 21, he has more money than anyone else does his age, a sexy girlfriend, and the respect of the mob. Henry soon teams up with Tommy De Vito (Pesci) and the two work the streets with Jimmy Conway (De Niro) for Paul Cicero (Paul Sorvino). What begins, as robbery becomes another crime: murder, extortion, booze, etc. But after Henry gets married and finds himself rooted deeper into the mob, he begins to take on more than he can handle. Director Scorsese grew up on the streets of New York and witnessed the rough life that people could have. He incorporates his own history into the characters of the film. This is a common practice in most of his films from ""Raging Bull,"" ""Taxi Driver,"" and ""Mean Streets,"" as he has a fascination and love for the Big Apple. But the most obvious aspect of that life is the violence. It is portrayed in ""Goodfellas"" from a realistic point of view. Scorsese does not hide the blood. He does not hide way people die or where they may end up. He simply shows the gut-wrenching reality of the mob world as is. The most affective example of that realistic violence is Pesci's performance, which garnered him an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in 1990. Tommy's character is a homicidal maniac, and a reminder of Cagney's performance in ""White Heat."" Pesci is horrifying to watch in action. From the opening scene where he stabs a body that is not quite dead, to his shooting of a young man named Spider who is slow to serve him a drink, the man is simply on fire. Pesci had a similar affect in ""Raging Bull."" As such, ""Goodfellas"" is Pesci's ""Raging Bull."" A scene in ""Raging Bull"" shows Pesci throwing a drink in a guy's face, then after a merciless beating, drags the guy out onto the street and repeatedly thrashes the man with a car door as the man's body lays half in the car and half outside it. The scene is horrific, but also enthralling. What is even more affective is Scorsese's use of music throughout the film. The time frame ranges from the 1960s to the late 1980s and the film's soundtrack plays like a time warp. The best use of music is Eric Clapton's ""Layla,"" in which Scorsese plays the song's last four minutesa piano and guitar duo that masterfully captures the feeling for the events in the film. Ultimately, ""Goodfellas"" is the equivalent of a mob-epic. Like the gangster pictures of the 1930s, there is also social commentaryit is the government that tries to crack down on these criminals, however, it is the police and other public sectors that are hand-in-hand with the moband little is ever done to change the situation. ****",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"""The Best Mob film ever""","This is the best mob film ever.  Scorsese's directing is on top just as are Deniro's and Liotta's performances.  Joe Pesci plays the perfect psycopath and Deniro as usual gives a great performance as  he does in every other Scorsese film.  New generation, old tradition, that's exactly what this movie is all about. In the old tradition a wise guy would never kill a made guy, in the new tradition, a wise guy does kill a made guy but he can't get away with it.Does the Godfather deserve to be in the same category as Goodfellas?  ""I say Yes.""  There are three reason's why I think this is true.  1. The directing in both movies captures the reality of mob life and how their lives end.  2. The acting in both movies is superlative 3. The two movies depict the same subject but with  different stories.I have to admit I think Goodfellas is much better than Godfather because the murder scenes in  The Godfather are too stylish and too made up. Goodfellas on the other hand is based on a true story and the violent scenes look real and you get that feel of reality in those scenes because it really did happen.  I'm not about to say Martin Scorsese is a better director than Coppola, but I feel that Scorsese's film Goodfellas has more emotion than Coppola's film Godfather. Remember that scene in Goodfellas when Deniro, Liotta, and Pesci are beating the life out of that made guy in the bar and you hear the music getting louder? That's what Scorsese does with his films. He uses music to enhance emotion in his movie's. Coppola does not do that, no music, no feeling, just a scene and a person.Some people may not like the ending of Goodfellas. To tell you the truth, I didn't like the ending at first, but I saw it five more times and I like it now. I know the ending doesn't give us a reason not to be a gangster, but Scorsese didn't want this film to have a sad ending like Blow. He wanted to make this film funny and crazy because that's the way Nicholas Pileggi's mob life was, funny and crazy. Scorsese did this film his way, the Martin Scorsese way.I recommend this movie to anyone who is a Scorsese fan.  I give it a 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
In hindsight - overrated,"I've been meaning to rewatch this film for about 15+ years and finally got around to watching it with my gf (her first viewing) and I was kind of disappointed. I grew up loving this movie, having watched it multiple times before the age of 13 everything in it seemed so exciting: the violence, the scary mob guys, the money, the camaraderie amongst the men. But the script / story really isn't that interesting in hindsight. The best part of the movie is probably the first 60-90 mins when all the characters are being introduced and your being immersed into this dangerous world. But after a while, it starts growing old. The bits with the night clubs and drinking, etc have been beaten to death by the time the movie is over. The scene with spider in particular is pointless, by that point in the movie we already know Tommy is a loose cannon, we don't need another 10 minute Segway to tell us that. The characters are all one dimensional and you don't really empathize with anyone, especially Henry and his wife. The acting by Paul Sorvino and De Niro are great and they ended up being more likeable than Henry.I don't know, I know the movies 31 years old at this point but I really wouldn't recommend it to anyone wanting to watch a crime movie, as there's been sooo many better ones released since then, with better action and story telling. It's not a terrible movie by any means and there are stretches where it's super enjoyable and the dialogue is funny but the supporting characters are the ones that make that happen. Overall I feel just meh after watching it. It's a historic movie for sure and at the time of its release was iconic (and still is) but the passage of time hasn't been kind to it. And perhaps I saw it too many times growing up so I'm familiar with all of its tricks, but it just doesn't feel as great to me anymore.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

A classic gangster film in its own right.,"All gangster movies will inevitably be compared to ""The Godfather"" series, but this one shines because it takes a daring, and hugely successful risk in not playing it for serious drama the whole way. It actually almost succeeds in making you ""like"" Henry Hill and his crew of Wiseguys. With the witty narration and comedic style, it's almost a fun comedy...and then, suddenly, savagely, it wrenches you back to reality as the plot takes a sinister, nasty turn.The classic scene in this picture has to be how Tommy (Joe Pesci) establishes the true maniacal menace of his character, without any *doubt*, and without any bloodshed. A lesser film would have shown you a few bloody examples of what Tommy is capable of as a sensational copout.

Brilliant narration,"Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci--their names say it all. De Niro and Pesci were iconography for 1980s gangster genre.Liotta plays Henry Hill--the main protagonist--who is seduced by life in the mafia; The film traces his humble beginnings as a runner-boy to his eventual rise to power. Guts, glory and power summarize the first half of the film.However, as it the film progress's, it gets bleaker and bleaker for Henry Hill as the price to pay for being in the mafia takes a toll on him.Clearly, Scorsese challenges the ideology that life in the mafia grants one power and glory--it sets up a direct contrast between mafia-power and the price to pay for that power. If the Godfather Trilogy glamorized the mafia, Goodfellas certainly deconstructs that glamor as the film progresses.The iconography is fantastic as it plays upon the usual mafia codes: flashy suits, cigars, nice cars and the actors themselves all serve to enhance the beautiful visual display of the gangster stereotypes used in the film.Brilliant, insightful and factual Goodfellas is a must see for any gangster-genre fan !",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Terrific,"""Goodfellas"" is one of those movies that if I catch it on tv, I stop clicking around. Even though I've seen it a bunch of times, I stop searching the channels and I watch it again. I remember seeing this movie in the theater (Bayside, NY). The theater was filled with a few loud-mouths and they took some of the thrill away from the movie. I've seen ""Goodfellas"" a bunch of times since and it's one of the greats. It's not a perfect movie but it comes close. By the way, this movie is special to me because the scenes at Joe Pesci's mother's house were filmed on the block where I grew up (241 Street, Bellerose, Queens, NY).",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
A Timeless Masterpiece,"Almost 30 years later, and this film still transcends above the rest. Although I was born years after this film came out, my heart swells when the intro starts. I believe it is Scorsese's best film. This film really takes you on a journey and puts in the shoes of these people, humanizing their lifestyle and their relationships. The soundtrack makes me giddy, and the way the film is shot truly makes you realize the art of movie making. Every time I re-watch the movie, I catch another small detail, providing more depth, beauty, and realness to the story. The first shot we see of Ray Liotta in the parking lot at the diner, the music, the camera angle, I get goosebumps every time.If you have not seen Goodfellas, stop what you are doing right now and watch it and then re-watch it immediately after again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
technical issue with this movie.,"This movie started off very good, but scene that opens at Idlewater Airport 1963 as denoted on screen and Henry HILL'S character is leaning on a 1965 Chevrolet Impala with a 1965 Buick wagon next to it just wrecked the ""authenticity ""...All that money spent and such a blatant screwup...Unforgivable..Perhaps change it to 1964 at the very least, that is when new models were released usually around labor day. Otherwise the potential was there for a truly good movie, mind you not as wonderful as that wonderful classic Godfather or Godfather 2.

One of the most entertaining movies ever.,"Goodfellas, Scorsese's timeless masterpiece is the most entertaining Gangster/Mafia movie ever made.

Some of my all time favourite scenes is in Goodfellas, mostly because of the brilliant acting but also due to the absoulutely hilarious screenplay which makes the scenes extremely entertaining and funny, Funny how? :) (One of my all time favourite scenes). Joe Pesci is simply brilliant in this film, it showcases just how good of an actor he is. Ray Liotta and Robert DeNiro are flawless in their roles aswell.

A simple testimony before a masterpiece,"""Goodfellas"" is a journey into the darkness of the human soul, a descent into the bowels of crime that leaves an indelible mark on the minds of viewers. Martin Scorsese, the undisputed master of cinema, guides us through a labyrinth of intrigue, violence, and ambition, offering a raw and relentless look at the life of gangsters. At the center of this whirlwind of emotions and actions, we find Henry Hill, masterfully portrayed by Ray Liotta, a complex character who embodies the ambition and cruelty of the criminal world. His performance is a tour de force of emotions, conveying to the audience the desperation and adrenaline that permeate his existence. But the true beating heart of the film lies in the interaction between the protagonists, played by Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro. The chemistry between these actors is palpable, fueling every scene with a tension and energy that captivates the viewer from the very first moment. Joe Pesci, in the role of the fearsome Tommy DeVito, embodies the brutality and instability of the criminal world, while Robert De Niro, as Jimmy Conway, brings his usual charisma and magnetism to the character, adding an element of charm and danger. Scorsese's direction is a masterpiece of technical and visionary mastery, guiding viewers through a whirlwind of emotions and sensations. His ability to create a claustrophobic and oppressive atmosphere, through the skillful use of cinematography and soundtrack, transports viewers directly into the heart of organized crime. But ""Goodfellas"" is much more than a simple gangster film. It is a portrait of human society, a profound reflection on the ambitions, passions, and weaknesses that drive our actions. Through the distorted lens of the mafia, Scorsese offers us a mirror of our own nature, shining a light on the shadows that lurk within each of us. ""Goodfellas"" is a timeless work of art, a monument to the power of cinema in capturing the essence of the human experience. Its influence extends far beyond the confines of the silver screen, shaping popular culture and leaving an indelible mark on the history of cinema. But to truly understand the power and emotion of this masterpiece, there is no other way than to see it with your own eyes.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Good mobster film,"Good mobster film. Robert De Niro. Ray Liotta. Joe Pesci.

All men are on fine form but, in ironically the lesser role, special mention to Pesci who steals the show as the wildly psychotic Tommy.

If you haven't seen it...,"...you should be shot!  This is the ultimate mob movie, and it really lives up to its tagline of ""three decades of life in the Mafia"".  Instead of being a standard, point-A to point-B kinda movie, Goodfellas really gives you the sense that you're watching someone's life unfold.  Just like in real life, characters move in and out of Henry's life, appearing and disappearing from view at random points in time.  We are treated to some ""precious moments"" that might not help advance the very loose plot, but give us glimpses in Henry's life.  For example, the long steadicam shot as Henry walks his future wife Karen into the Copacabana, the famous ""funny"" sequence, and the scene where Tommy's mother cooks the guy's dinner while they have a body in the trunk really give you a sense that these are REAL people, not the stereotypes in fedoras and slick suits that you often see in gangster pictures.

"""I'm funny how? Funny like a clown? I amuse you? I make you laugh?""","A contemporary classic stylishly directed by Martin Scorsese, it's among his finest two plus hours (and that's really saying something coming from the man who brought us Taxi Driver & Raging Bull!). He once again teams with Robert De Niro to bring this amazing tale of New York City's organized crime syndicate in the late 70's to life. The supporting cast includes Ray Liotta, Lorraine Bracco and Joe Pesci (in the scene-stealing performance that won him the Oscar). The use of the oldies pop/rock soundtrack has often been imitated but never duplicated (though Pulp Fiction would be a comparable comparison). Scorsese's dramatization of Henry Hill's life as a gangster shows us the seduction, the allure and ultimately the sickness and fatalistic consequences of living the life as a somebody in a world of nobodies.Though Goodfellas is categorized as an action movie and does contain the requisite number of fights, explosions, etc. it's actually much more finely nuanced and psychologically complex than what you'd normally expect from this genre. Joe Pesci delivers an equally powerful performance as sociopath Tommy DeVito. Tommy is so remorseless that he casually discusses cooking while burying one of the unfortunate victims of his lightning-quick temper. It's Tommy's non-chalant that makes him so frightening.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
The rise and fall of these mobsters.,"A very ambitious and interesting film. The movie starts with our main character as just a boy narrating how he became a gangster and we follow him through is life. The film has an aspect ratio of 16:9 and looks terrific in 4k, as do so many movies of this era shot on film. The films set design, costumes and props all deserve praise. It's a dark looking movie with a lot of it taking place at night or in these shady bars and houses. We see the twisted values of the mob, a macho world where violence speaks louder than words. The story you can follow but it does occasionally get a bit tricky to keep track of, given the large cast. Joe Pesci won an Oscar for this playing an erratic psychopath, a volcano that can erupt at any moment. This is film with a great deal of anger in it too, all it's characters harbour these terrible emotions. Ray Liotta and Lorraine Bracco deserve lots of praise for their work. The film also shows us the drugs and paranoia the main character descends into. I didn't find the characters all that relatable when they're all essentially villains, but that's the difficulty of making a film like this. The film never really shows the impact the violence has on other characters either, but I suppose everyone is so used to it that they just accept it. The film doesn't do what the untouchables did and give us an important police character we can also follow, the story is seen squarely through the eyes of the gangsters.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Favourite Movie of All Time,"This movie is an all time classic starring Robert De Niro,Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta and directed by Scorsese....What's not to love! It is a perfect movie about the Mafia and Henry Hill. It is based off the book Wiseguy by Nicholas Pileggi which is a book I have read recently and is also amazing. Ray Liotta's acting mixed with Robert De Niro's and Joe Pesci's really sets this movie over the edge. The chemistry between the three guys is off the chart and I personally think that this is Scorsese's best work. Casino is a close second. A lot of people seem to think that The Godfather is a better movie but I personally think that Goodfellas is far superior and deserves more credit as it is brilliant.

Go get yer fudgin' shine box!,"This is still one of the best Italian mafia movies to date and with great reason. Outside of the slightly bloated runtime with a second half that may have been unevenly paced as the first half man this movie was still such a delight. The acting was sensational. The story was immersive. The soundtrack catchy and appropriate for the settings. And narration that was more helpful than harmful. Joe Pesci alone is worth watching this one for who won an Oscar for this role with stellar reason for it too. He was an unhinged maniac from start to finish but was so captivating to witness and had such a charismatic entertaining charm to him you just couldn't help but not look away as he went on with his wild and wacky antics. The foreshadowing was fantastic too as call backs to earlier segments of the film popped up numerous times as the movies progressed so you got a sense of payoff in the end. It's few and far between we get such pivotal writing like this anymore. And lastly this movie is a meme, gif and quote machine to date, gracing us with a plethora of wonderfully memorable lines and moments that became timeless.

Some of his actions are downright scary, from winding Ray Liotta up early on in the film, to some of his actions later on. He really is disturbed.The plot takes us through the life of Henry Hill (Liotta) from how he got involved as a youngster, to how he ends up later on in life.Some of the dialog is fantastic, Pesci joking with Liotta in the restaurant is memorable, and I find myself using lines from the film in daily life.

"Brash, energetic, and brilliantly directed Mob movie","""Goodfellas"" is a superb movie presenting an amoral and very real-seeming portrait of the Mafia. Where ""The Godfather"" limits itself to a sepia palette and a somber tone, ""Goodfellas"" is brash, busy, and captures both the humor and the horror of a mobster's life. Nor do the Goodfellas pretend to have noble motivations. Instead, they're a bunch of power-hungry guys who band together for protection but double-cross each other at the first opportunity. Many admit to a compulsive love for crime, including robber Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and, especially, the unhinged, trigger-happy Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci).Tommy and Jimmy are the closest associates of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), the movie's narrator and main character: all are mid-level mob guys who start out around the same time. Henry is half-Irish, so he knows that the Mafia will never fully welcome him. This outsider quality complicates his personality and makes him an ideal narrator.""Goodfellas"" runs on style and atmosphere rather than a linear plot. The first hour culminating in the famous long-take at the Copacabana nightclubshows the glamorous appeal of the mob lifestyle for young Henry. It's the Rat Pack early sixties, and America and the mob are still somehow innocent. As we follow Henry into the late sixties and beyond, the mob becomes more insular and a parody of what it once was. The women have tacky outfits and hard-edged faces; the men's crimes get bigger. Henry gets involved in drug dealing, and his wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco) turns from a tough-but-sweet Jewish girl into a full- fledged Mafia wife.The best part of the movie is the virtuoso, suspenseful, darkly funny sequence (it could almost stand on its own as a short film) where Henry's responsibilities as mobster and family man threaten to overwhelm him. In the course of a single day, he must keep his drug smuggling, mafia connections, large extended family, and mistress under control, while trying to evade a helicopter that seems to be following him. The editing and music perfectly recreate Henry's jittery, cocaine-fueled paranoia. Indeed, ""Goodfellas"" has probably the best compilation soundtrack that I've ever heard: each song perfectly fits.There is always so much going on at once in ""Goodfellas""music, narration, dialogue, camera movements and imagesthat boredom is not an option and dazzling moments come frequently. And its ambivalent moral perspective (should we love these men and their lifestyle, or hate them?) gives you something to think about after the pop songs and shootings have ended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
A Modern Mafia Tale,"For so long ""The Godfather"" and its superior sequel ""The Godfather: Part II"" were held up as the ultimate gangster movies.  There had been imitators, yet none could match the originality and sheer weight of the Corleone saga.If anyone were to recreate the mafia genre, or at least redefine it, it would have to be someone with the right cultural baggage.  Martin Scorsese had already painted an indelible vision of New York through ""Mean Streets"", ""Taxi Driver"" and to a lesser extent, ""Raging Bull.""  In that sense, he was the perfect choice to direct a modern version of a genre that inspires, fears and captures the imagination of audiences on a similar level to science fiction.Instead of rehashing the past of ""The Godfather"", Scorsese drew from a more recent past: the 1960's and 70's.  In fact Scorsese drew most inspiration from a book by journalist Nicholas Pileggi, entitled 'Wiseguy'.  After both men made contact with one another they set about creating a script for a film based upon the book.The premise for the film is based around the true story of a 1980's court case involving an informant for a New York mafia family.  Henry Hill (Christopher Serrone) is a 13-year old boy growing up in 1950's Brooklyn. Awestruck by his daily mafia surroundings, Henry is drawn to the allure of a gangster's life.  While his father, of Irish stock, works away in a blue-collar life of drudgery, Henry sees the mafia as a way out to a life of glamour, girls, money and ultimately, respect.He begins his journey as an errand boy for local crime boss Paul Cicero (Paul Sorvino), collecting debts and doing damage when required.  As Henry says in the narration, ""I was earning more money at 14 than most of the adults in the neighbourhood.""  Absolutely and utterly enamoured with his new life, Henry is proud to be a mobster.At this stage of the film, we feel as if we are in Corleone territory. Everything is nostalgic to the point of rose-tintedness, we as an audience are drawn to what the mafia represents: a tough guy fraternity that deals above the law.  Henry's ascension into the mafia life is something we view with a smile rather than a frown.By the 1960's we catch up with the adult Henry (Ray Liotta).  Now 21 years old, he and his friend and cohort Tommy De Vito (Joe Pesci) are foot soldiers for boss Cicero.  Robbing trucks for cigarettes, clothing and alcohol, the two forge a name for themselves as good earners.  Despite their accomplishments, they pale in comparison the 'made' guys, the real Mafioso who run Cicero's shady underworld.Scorsese introduces us to the Cicero family in a superb steadicam sequence early on in the film.  As Henry walks through a nightclub we are shown the caricatures of mafia hitmen.  He narrates over the top and presents us characters with names like Fat Andy, Frankie the Wop, Jimmy No Nose, Pete the Killer and Jimmy Two Times.  If one were to be not paying attention, you could be mistaken that you were watching ""Dick Tracy"".One character not caricatured at all is Jimmy Conway, played by the great Robert De Niro.  Cool, calm, tough and quietly evil, Conway is the ultimate gangster, bristling with venom and style.  Due to his Irish background, Conway will never be made, yet his presence is enough to suggest that his standing on the ladder is a non-issue.  De Niro plays Conway brilliantly, drawing from his portrayl of Jake La Motta in ""Raging Bull"".  Once again, the tag team combination of Scorsese and De Niro just about makes the film, despite the overall excellence of the movie.Henry climbs higher and higher up the ladder of the mafia, marrying a Jewish girl named Karen (Lorraine Bracco) along the way and forging a name for himself as a gangster who's 'got things worked out'.  He's earning big and the Cicero family is doing nicely.  It all goes pear-shaped when Henry's goals change: he acquires a mistress and begins dealing cocaine.  As his lavish tastes and dangerous lifestyle escalate, the workings of the Cicero family also begin to change.  The 1970's introduce new, more violent and extravagant opportunities to make money for Henry, Tommy and Jimmy, all of which start the rot.  It all begins to tumble down and Henry and Karen are forced to make decisions that could cost them dearly in the long run.""Goodfellas"" is blessed with outstanding performances all round.  Liotta's Henry is understated, yet we travel along his journey of self-destruction easily.  Like Henry himself, we are too caught up in the speed and glamour of the life to take stock of where he ends up.  Pesci is amazing as the volatile yet charismatic Tommy.  He won an Oscar for his role (and repeated this performance in 1995's ""Casino"") and it's obvious why.  The sense of unease mixed with humour around Tommy is a credit to Pesci's ability to invisibly and unassumingly flick the switch between joker and psychopath. Bracco is also strong as Karen.  She has since taken up a more subdued role on the television series ""The Sopranos""; also based on the mafia.  Also of note are Chuck Low as Morrie, Frank Vincent as Billy Bats and the late Catherine Scorsese as Tommy's mother.Scorsese's collaborators Michael Ballhaus (cinematography) and Thelma Schoonmaker (editing) once again deliver.  Ballhaus captures the mood of each decade perfectly: the nostalgia and innocence of the 1950's, the power of the 1960's and the seedy 1970's, they are all captured brilliantly. Also of note is the final few scenes involving a coked-up Henry trying to do a million things at once.  The frenetic pace and quick editing of this section is a credit to both Ballhaus and Schoonmaker.The director is in total control of proceedings, with the film never altering from its course.  The use of music is superlative, the costumes and overall mise en scene of the film is pure genius.  Scorsese hasn't matched ""Goodfellas"" since, and while ""Taxi Driver"" remains his best, ""Goodfellas"" ranks extremely close.By the end of the film the viewer realises that they have witnessed a different kind of gangster movie.  Brutal, fast, exciting and violent, ""Goodfellas"" is the anti-""Godfather"".  It portrays the mafia life as an uncompromising and shady world, yet one that rewards those who play by its rules.  It is a difficult feat for the greatest of directors to create a movie that engrains itself on popular culture, but Scorsese once again delivers.  ""Goodfellas"" is the best modern gangster movie and ranks alongside ""The Godfather"" as the best of the mobster genre.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
The Best Mafia Movie Ever Made!,"This film blows The Godfather saga out of the water! This is an excellent film! The characters are way more interesting than The Godfather, in my opinion.

His friends, and buddies are a much older man Jimmy Conway (Robert DeNiro) and a about-the-same-age violent mental midget Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci).

It clearly shows why people could love that life and don't want to stop and at the same time why these are absolute garbage humans. It shows how these absolutely unredeemable people are also pretty normal people at the same time without making the audience relate to them which is always a great feat in any narrative medium. Films like Godfather or Once Upon a Time in America are more about the characters and their story arcs where we need to relate to some characters on some levels. Here it is about showing the life of gangsters as it is without the burden of making it relatable. The choice of someone outside of the circle becoming part of it and who couldn't climb to the top, was perfect in a fictional aspect, as it gives the actual consequences of their action more closely as opposed to the supposed larger picture that is often shown in other films. Even when the film itself is very stylized, it's always grounded and the real story aspect of it gives this film a kind of credibility where the actions and consequences are actual examples and it truly mirrors the world that the film wants to show us.Even though it is already a great movie, what really made it one of the greatest is Henry Hill's spiral in the last act. From the moment he starts noticing the helicopter, it moves into a different gear. If anyone in the audience had any doubts, those are all cleared after that point. It really peels off the layers and through the cocaine-high protagonist, the very justified anxiety is resonated through the screen.This is probably my favourite Scorsese. Wolf of Wall Street seems to be Scorsese's attempt at going even more over the top with the same approach of storytelling and it works too, but this was a perfect balance that is missing there.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Goodfellas,"Good movies often weave or show the audience a new world. That's how Goodfellas shows the audience an Italian gangster in New York. The film is full of a large number of narratives, introducing the details of the gang, like the scene of Henry's marriage. The traditional protection fee has been impacted by drugs. In addition, Tommy in the team is too reckless. In addition, drugs are also used. The three teams disintegrate. The good guys work hard for their own survival.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

"One night, Bobby Vinton sent us champagne","In many ways the quintessential Scorsese picture, tying together all the director's favourite hobbyhorses and actors (The Mob, De Niro, the Rolling Stones), GoodFellas was the first great crime thriller of the 1990s - and a classic as soon as it opened.Based on the memoir by stool pigeon Henry Hill, it has lost none of its chilly, seductive power with the passing of time, owing to career-defining turns from Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci - the latter so good he'd virtually reprise the role for Goodfellas' spiritual twin, Casino, along with a soundtrack to literally die for, bravura camera-work and some authentic, blackly funny dialogue.

I understand that there are the hardcore devotee's to The 1st two Godfather films, but to me (and many others) this is the quintessential gangster film. I used to watch this film over and over and I usually try and nitpick even some of of the all time great films, but there is nothing I can pick on in this film!

Goodfellas is really really really good,"Goodfellas, along with Pulp Fiction, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, and Se7en, is one of the very best of the movies that the 1990's had to offer. In my review for Casino, I said that I believed that Casino was slightly better than Goodfellas. I think that Casino is underrated, because Goodfellas is all the rage and Casino seemed to get sloppy seconds because both of these films are so similar in style, context, and nature. Casino just seemed like it flowed better than Goodfellas, but, as I said before, just slightly. For me, it's like comparing The Godfather and The Godfather Part 2. It's just so close that the winner of the race is hard to call. However, Goodfellas is an amazing piece of cinema that should have been awarded the best picture Oscar. It was daring and new, and it does deserve its place in the top 50 movies of all time on this site. Martin Scorsese is a master director who is a force to be reckoned with. Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci light up the screen, too. Roger Ebert said that he felt that Goodfellas was better than The Godfather. I do not agree with that statement, because I do not feel that it is better than The Godfather or The Godfather Part 2. These films are just so amazing. Goodfellas deserves its place as one of the greatest American films. I just think that Casino deserves some time in the spotlight, as well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Retribution by friends,"In 1990 two movies about gangsters came out. One with Robert De Niro and Ray Liotta and seeing as Ray has now passed suddenly his part is now immortalised.Then there was Joe Pesci also starring and one other film with mobsters with Gary Oldman and Sean Penn..Now, seeing as i have watched Goodfellas more times than i can remember and still remember a lot of the scenes it is a fantastic piece of filmmaking.The fact that your friends will talk to you and help you and be happy with you one minute and in the next scene will shoot you dead is chilling in itself!!But heres the thing, the other mobster film of that year was the underrated gem called ""State Of Grace"" which again is mobsters but not just the mafia and italians as was Goodfellas but the Irish mob.Sometimes you watch or rewatch a movie and you see it in a new light but with Goodfellas it never changes.. It is a masterpiece of film making and top notch from all actors. Even Samuel L Jacksons small role is pivitol to the scene..I mention State of Grace here because its right up there in terms of mob films for many reasons particularly Gary Oldman's portrayal as Jackie Flannery.

"Goodfellas: A Cinematic Rollercoaster Through Mob Life, Scorsese's Masterpiece Earns a Solid 8/10 for Its Intensity and Timeless Appeal","Goodfellas, an 8, dude! Martin Scorsese takes you deep into the mob world, and it's a cinematic experience that's both thrilling and raw. De Niro and Pesci are like the OGs of the gangster game, bringing the characters to life with an unmatched intensity.The storytelling is on point - it's like you're in on the heists, the schemes, and the betrayals. The soundtrack, bro, it's a mixtape of classic hits that elevate the whole vibe. From 'Layla' during the helicopter scene to 'Gimme Shelter' in the aftermath, it's a symphony of crime and chaos. The camera work, especially the famous tracking shot through the Copacabana, is pure genius - a rollercoaster through the glitz and grit of the mob life.Sure, it's not a perfect 10 because some parts drag a bit, but that doesn't take away from the overall ride. 'Goodfellas' is like a cinematic rollercoaster - fast, intense, and a bit dangerous. It's a must-watch for anyone craving a taste of mob life without the consequences. A solid 8 because it's a classic that stands the test of time, leaving you with a mix of awe and a twisted appreciation for the mob's twisted world.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Sublime Gangster Movie,"Undoubtedly, Goodfella's is an exceptional film that portrays life in a notorious gang, with no holds barred.  The cast is simply electric, as Ray Liotta delivers a wonderfully colourful and emotional performance as the boy striving to be a someone in a land of 'losers'.  The film focuses on Liotta's ambition to be part of something extraordinary, something that will give him an identity above anyone else.  Robert de Niro eventually becomes an overseer of Liotta's and together with Joe Pesci, who's depiction of Tommy Devito - a brutal gang member who always acts before he thinks - become embroiled in heists of an undercover nature.  The pace of the movie is exquisite, as issues of ambition and loyalty ensure Liotta's (Henry Hill) excitement of the way the other half live is kept to optimum.  Love is also on the horizon, but a Mobsters world is never a straight die as drugs cloud judgement and errors test friendships.  Simply fantastic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

A brilliantly executed story of organised crime,"This movie is held up as one of the great Mafia movies of all time, and for good reason. Over the course of the film, we are the shown the Mafia lifestyle through the eyes of our narrator, Henry Hill. Our other main characters are Tommy DeVito and Jimmy Conway, Henry's mob partners who often show the more gruesome parts of Mafia dealings. Ray Liotta (Henry), Joe Pesci (Tommy), and Jimmy (Robert De Niro) bring in brilliant performances that makes truly invested in these characters and makes them feel more than simply actors within the film.The plot of the film follows Henry through his childhood through to his adult life and his associations with the Mafia. This film does a fantastic job at first sucking the viewer in to the sense that the mafia isn't so bad as we see the mobsters accepting Henry as their own and their seemingly affable nature, which can be seen especially in Jimmy. As Henry grows up however the audience begins to see the more violent and amoral dealings of the Mafia that shatter the image of the romantic life that was presented at the beginning as well as other portrayals of Mafia in the media.Something that also has to be mentioned is Martin Scorsese's use of music and sound within the film. Music within the film helps to both capture the time period of the 50's all the way through to the 70's as well as relate to the situation at hand. It gives the film a good rhythm and pace that makes each scene interesting to watch and flows easily into one another, leaving you on the edge of your seat as it makes the two and a half hour run-time feel short as every minute engrosses you into the reality of the film.Overall, a quintessential film for any fan of Mafia movies or film buffs, as well as one of the best films to introduce you to Scorsese's work.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
My favorite Scorsese movie!,"Goodfellas.The real story of a half Irish ,half Italian man called Henry Hill who's following the steps of his gangster role model Jimmy Conway .Goodfellas is definitely a classic ,when it comes to Mafia movies but it is not flawless !The plot was very interesting at first ,the first hour went great in presenting the characters ,but I believe that the plot in the second hour was slow-paced and less interesting.So, Scorsese did great with the writing ,even better with the directing I guess ,but that wasn't the best thing about Goodfellas .The good thing about Goodfellas were the badfellas , Ray Liotta , Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. I think we all agree that they were phenomenal and as much as I know ,Pesci was the only one who got an Oscar and it's definitely deserved .Finally and once again ,this is a top classic Mafia movie ,one of my favorites but it just doesn't get near to ""the godfather "" for me!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
A must watch,I'm a fan of gangster movies and this movie is the top of all gangster movies. I also consider it my top 5 favorite of all movies. The director of photography was beautifully done.

On of my fav movies,"Goodfellas (1990), directed by Martin Scorsese, is a masterclass in crime filmmaking. Based on the true story of Henry Hill, it follows his rise and fall in the mob, offering a gritty, unflinching look at the criminal underworld. Ray Liotta shines as Hill, with standout performances by Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, the latter delivering an unforgettable, menacing turn. Scorsese's dynamic direction, coupled with a pulsating soundtrack, makes the film an intense, immersive experience. Goodfellas is a definitive gangster classic.Goodfellas is a gripping, fast-paced exploration of loyalty, power, and betrayal, showcasing Scorsese's signature style.

How can you better this?,"Goodfellas is the ultimate in movies,it makes you feel every emotion possible and despite its length it never stutters in intensity or storytelling. The casting is spot on, everyone of the characters is hard to imagine anyone else playing the role,maybe Paulie is a bit too likable but then maybe he was in reality who knows! There are so many standout performances that to pick one seems a slight on the others,but Joe Pesci where did that come from? Simply awesome. The Godfather was a great picture and set a standard far above anything previous the progression upwards from that is Goodfellas My one reservation being from a crime movie perspective is where do you go from here",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Easily the best film of the 90's,"Third on the ""best gangster film"" list; right behind the first two GODFATHERS- This grand story follows the lives of a group of tough hoods through four fascinating decades. Scorsese is the world's current greatest living filmmaker; and he really hit an amazing peak here. The direction, cast, editing, script and period detail are all flawless. Unlike the GODFATHER, these hoods are petty, wild and occasionally insane. These are working guys, living it up and ""earning"" at all costs. Scorsese changes gears according to the times: The laid-back, high living' 50's and 60's; the crazy, coked-out 70's; as well as the crash-and-burn 80's; Scorsese show the flash, the power, and the degradation of these amazing guys.

One of the best films ever,"This is Scorsese's masterpiece. Thought of by many as his best film ever, i can see why. The film based on Pileggi's book about Henry Hill (Liotta) and his buddies Jimmy Conway and Tommy De Vito's quest to move up the mob hierarchy as they commit a robbery and then start to kill people involved in it. Henry seems to be having a great time but is affected negatively both in his personal and business life because of his two lose cannon friends. Scorsese does a brilliant job adapting this to the screen and produces one of the best directed and written films ever with Goodfellas. With amazing cinematography from Michael Ballhaus, and very good editing from Thelma Schoonmaker and James Y Kwei, this film is a classic and one of my favorite films of all time.IMDb Rating: 8.8.

A Stylish Crime Saga with a Disjointed Narrative,"Martin Scorsese once again showcases his mastery of the crime drama genre, bringing to life the rise and fall of gangster Henry Hill. The film immerses viewers in the world of the mafia, with its rules, betrayals, and brutality, creating an intense atmosphere from the very first minutes.The plot is undoubtedly engaging, but at times, it feels somewhat fragmented and disjointed. This might be due to the director's attempt to cover a long stretch of the protagonist's life, highlighting key moments while losing some fluidity in transitions between events.What truly shines is the acting. Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Ray Liotta deliver outstanding performances. Joe Pesci's portrayal of Tommy stands out in particular-volatile, unpredictable, and terrifying, yet undeniably charismatic.The film's visual style, cinematography, and soundtrack also deserve praise. Scorsese masterfully uses editing and music to transport the audience into the era.Overall, Goodfellas is a powerful and stylish crime film that, despite some structural shortcomings, captivates with its atmosphere and stellar performances.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"Is all of the hype and praising of this ""movie"" really warranted? I'll be the judge of that.","""Goodfellas"" (1990), honestly, why is this considered one of the best gangster films of all-time? It should really be called: ""Badfellas""! Don't get me wrong, I love gangster films and I was excited to watch this ""movie"" for the first time. But, at the end of the day, I was ultimately just disappointed with it overall. It has a very messy and convoluted storyline, mediocre to over the top acting, and a boring generic soundtrack. The storyline is basically just the realistic life of the mafia. It's based off the novel, ""Wiseguy"" by Nicholas Pileggi. One thing about this novel is that it's non-fiction. I'm not the biggest fan of non-fiction books or other media. However, ""Wiseguy"" is one of those non-fictional novels that I enjoy reading. I thought: ""this would make an interesting movie!"" Then, when I looked into it and discovered that ""Goodfellas"" was based on this novel it sparked my interest. The concept had great potential, and I saw that the screenplay was in fact written by Nicholas Pileggi himself. Then, I saw that Martin Scorsese joined in writing the screenplay and I thought: ""yeah, I understand it has to meet feature film standards. How much can Martin Scorsese possibly change with the story?"" I think that Martin Scorsese should have just left the screenplay writing duties to Nicholas Pileggi, because he completely screwed it up! The story would have probably been stronger if Martin Scorsese kept his hands off the screenplay and stuck to directing. Another thing, is the annoying and constant narration in the ""film"". Narration can be effective when utilized properly, but when it's overdone like in this ""movie"", it just becomes downright unbearable! Film Making 101: to have a stronger impact in your film, show, don't tell. If you're going to add in narration, make sure it aids in telling the story. In this ""film"", it's absolutely distracting from the story. What little there is! Such a crying shame, because the original concept would have made a great movie! There is one thing I'd like to point out, and it's something positive in this ""film"". For those who may not know, one thing I like to see in cinema is a good long single take. Of course, there are a few out there that aren't that great, or boring. But, the one in this ""movie"" is fantastic and one of the best single shots I've seen in any film. It's just about three minutes in length without any cuts whatsoever. The scene where Henry, played by Ray Liotta and Karen, played by Lorraine Braco make their way into the restaurant. That shot is so well laid out, and the final result was worth it. So, I will give the ""movie"" some extra credit for that, some, because long single shots can be very hard to nail. That, in my opinion, is the biggest highlight of this ""film"". As for the acting, it's overall just over the top, in the worst possible way. The best performances come from Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro. Ray Liotta was okay, but he just looked bored playing his role. As a result, I was bored watching him! The rest of the actors and actresses are nothing but mediocre. I don't understand, all of the major actors and actresses in this ""film"" give great performances in other films and shows. What's their excuse here? The soundtrack has a couple of memorable parts. But, for the most part it's just dull and therefore it makes the ""movie"" dull as well. Now for the positives, yes there are two positives in this ""film"", which are the sets/locations and the special effects. All of the sets/locations are great. You can't go wrong with filming your movie in an iconic city like New York. I may not enjoy visiting the city itself, but it's really entertaining to watch on movies and shows! The sets/locations give the ""film"" a great atmosphere. The only other positive is the special effects. All of the special effects were very well-done and still hold up to this day. ""Goodfellas"" is overall just a failure in the gangster genre. I don't care how praised a film is, I don't care how much money it makes and I don't care how many awards it wins. All of that means nothing! If I think a film is crap, then it's crap. This ""movie"" is no exception of that! I give it 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Stay away from ""Goodfellas"", or else you'll just end up being whacked with massive disappointment!",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Goodfellas,"The movie is really about local gangsters, not real mafias, big criminal organizations. Joe Percy is usually aggressive and murderous, but more cathartic, and early in the film, the bad luck in the back of the car, he needs to panic to repair the knife. Telling jokes, making a sudden turn in fashion, deliberately bluffing, alluding to his underlying scoundrel. By contrast, the Mafia has dealt with him cleanly, showing the gap between amateurs and professionals.Those who have been in the gang, or have been in contact with those people, will find Joe Percy's performance in Goodfellas extremely resonant.

Joe Pesci's character is good because he loves his mother. Maybe they could have had more construction workers in it, like with the Sopranos- would have been too much like Grand Theft Auto though.

Because, after all, this film aimed to depict the mafia lifestyle, it was never an action or thriller-based story. The random violence that occurs and brilliant narration throughout only serve to further enhance the entire image the film gets across. The character relationships are also cleverly forged together, and the unpredictable nature of the film allows you to hinge nicely throughout and keeps you in suspense. Perhaps this film is not for everyone, if you like a proper storyline you may be disappointed, but this film is pure genius since it followed- and achieved what it set out to do- shock and exploit the very innards of gangster life. Now become the don and watch it :D",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

GoodFellas,"Ray Liotta is superb here as ""Henry Hill"", a man whom ever since he was young has been captivated by the mob. He starts off as a runner and before too long has ingratiated himself with the local fraternity lead by ""Paulie"" (Paul Sorvino) and is best mates with fellow hoods, the enigmatic and devious ""Jimmy"" (Robert De Niro) and the excellently vile ""Tommy"" (Joe Pesci). They put together an audacious robbery at JFK and are soon the talk of the town, but the latter in the trio is a bit of a live-wire and when he goes just a bit too far one night, the three of them find that their really quite idyllic lives of extortion and larceny start to go awry - and it's their own who are on their tracks. Scorsese takes him time with this story: the development of the characters - their personalities, trust, inter-reliance, sometimes divided, fractured, loyalties and ruthlessness and are built up in a thoroughly convincing fashion. We can, ourselves, see the obvious attractions for the young ""Henry"" of a life so very far removed from his working class Irish-Italian background - the wine, the women, the thrills; it's tantalising! If anything let's it down it's the last half hour; it's just a little too predictable and having spent so long building up the characters, we seem to be in just a bit too much of a rush; but that is a nit-pick. It's not the ""Godfather"" but it is not far short.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Overrated,"This film and Scorsese are overrated beyond belief! I'm sure he has many friends up high that have been pumping up his movies' reviews for decades. I'll never forget what a huge piece of garbage ""Gangs of New York"" was. It currently sits at 7.5/10 in IMDB. Yeaah, sure. Goodfellas is about the same theme: gangsters. It's full of mindless, excessive violence that means and teaches absolutely nothing. A film empty of any meaning. The soundtrack was nice at some points but not nearly enough to justify spending time to watch this film. I have to note that 3 of the friends I was watching it with fell asleep.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

You can feel the emotions of the characters. The tension in a room as soon as stuffs about to go down, this movie isn't just a movie, it makes you feel like it actually happens, it seems real and genuine.

"An Amazing Movie, Just Not my Type","There is no doubt that Goodfellas is one of the defining movies of the 1900's and arguably considered the greatest gangster movie of all time. BUT, this just isn't my kind of movie. 2 hours and 25 minutes of hushed talks between everybody dressed the same isn't that entertaining. Don't let my rating of Goodfellas effect your viewing experience, but a Biography/Crime/Drama movie isn't setting itself for success.

My parents absolutely love Goodfellas, so people who grew up in the 80's and 90's would enjoy it the most.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"Dull mob opera at the root, but rich subtext and a directing tour-de-force","This is one of the most impressive movies I've seen at the film-making level. I'm extremely interested in the way directors build films as audiovisual evocative worlds with specific rules, more than I am in the actual stories told, so of course I enjoyed this immensely.I can see the influence this film had on many directors, sadly the style elements that were borrowed from it (mainly the editing/score style) have been very badly executed most of the time. Strangely, I think that only french directors Gaspard Noé (in ""Carne"" and ""Seul contre tous"") and Jean-Pierre Jeunet (in ""Delicatessen"" and ""Amélie"") could pull off effective cinematic works with these editing/score structures. Since then, in mainstream cinema, these elements have mostly degenerated in a derivative mannerism without any power. Sad.Yeah, I definitely enjoyed the ride, and took good note of many fantastic cinematic devices, some great subtext (food as philosophy, almost as a character)... but still I have complaints.The first one is De Niro. Sorry but when I see him here, I still see an actor, not a character. I can take this when the movie takes a strong self-referential stance, deliberately using actors as actors, like in ""Jackie Brown"" or ""Brazil"" where De Niro fits perfectly. But here it doesn't work for me, I found it distracting (""hey, look, it's De Niro!"").The second one is the root substance. These mob operas generally are entertaining, but have a very shallow philosophy, follow very strict narrative conventions and don't have much to offer as culture. I even find them rather questionable as role models for adolescents.So what we have here is brilliant thanks to the director, and the director only. Even at the acting level: yes they're good, but their acting alone wouldn't have such power showed if Scorcese had not used them as a Chess Master, moving pieces on the board.Shallow substance, but very intelligent movie-making with power, wit and imagination. Enthralling. So much so that it's only when the movie is over that one (possibly) realizes that something is missing. A tour-de-force.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Essential Gangster Movie,"This is essential for anyone who enjoys gangster drama. Fantastic movie.The best gangster movie ever. It is one of my favorite movies of all- time.Martin Scorsese explores the life of organized crime with his gritty, kinetic adaptation of Nicolas Pileggi's best-selling Wiseguy, the true- life account of mobster and FBI informant Henry Hill. Set to a true-to- period rock soundtrack, the story details the rise and fall of Hill, a half-Irish, half-Sicilian New York kid who grows up idolizing the ""wise guys"" in his impoverished Brooklyn neighborhood. He begins hanging around the mobsters, running errands and doing odd jobs until he gains the notice of local chieftain Paulie Cicero (Paul Sorvino), who takes him in as a surrogate son. As he reaches his teens, Hill (Ray Liotta) is inducted into the world of petty crime, where he distinguishes himself as a ""stand-up guy"" by choosing jail time over ratting on his accomplices. From that moment on, he is a part of the family. Along with his psychotic partner Tommy (Joe Pesci), he rises through the ranks to become Paulie's lieutenant; however, he quickly learns that, like his mentor Jimmy (Robert DeNiro), his ethnicity prevents him from ever becoming a ""made guy,"" an actual member of the crime family. Soon he finds himself the target of both the feds and the mobsters, who feel that he has become a threat to their security with his reckless dealings. Goodfellas was rewarded with six Academy Award nominations including Best Picture; Pesci would walk away with Best Supporting Actor for his work.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
as far back as I can remember...,"...I always wanted to be a gangster. ""Goodfellas"" is not just a film, for me it is also a part of my life story. I worked as a tour guide at the Museum of the American Gangster on St. Marks Place in the Lower East Side for two years. There I reported on the Cosa Nostra and of course also on the Lufthansa Heist. There I also met Henry Hill - a diamond in the Mafia chandelier and co-orchestrator of the biggest robbery in the history of JFK Airport. 5 million in cash, 875,000 in jewels. Martin Scorsese directs the whole thing tastefully behind the camera - every shot fits like a tailor-made suit. There is also a soundtrack where every song plays at the right time. Cynical, brutal and stylish: Goodfellas is not a film - it is an invitation to join the mob until you first meet someone who aims a pistol at you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
The Best Gangster Movie Ever Made Bar None,"'Goodfellas', alongside 'Pulp Fiction' stands as my all time favorite film. Based on Nicolas Pillegi's outstanding novel the screenplay is intelligent and thrilling and gives credence to each performer. In crime movies the female leads (if any) are whiny and one dimensional but Lorraine Bracco's Oscar nominated perfromance is brilliant and her character is as dimensional as Henry (a slightly disappointing Ray Liotta, he rushes the voice-over and much of his dialogue). Jimmy (forget Raging Bull, this is DeNiro's greatest performance)Conway is pure genius and Pesci is great as the plain insane Tommy DeVito.Scorcese directs with a fast moving and in your face visual style and punctuates the soundtrack with some of the best rock/pop songs of the sixties and seventies, ending with Sid Viscous's 'My Way' was a stroke of genius and putting 'Down Below the Ocean' over the Batt's murder was insane but it worked because it goes against the grain.People say the Godfather is the greatest crime movie ever and perhaps they are right. But I have to disagree, 'Goodfellas' is more energetic more exciting and most importantly more FUN than the dreary, boring Godfather's.A flat out, awe inspiring, no-one will ever make a film as good as this again MASTERPIECE.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

These Italian know how to have a good time. When Henry Hill(Ray Liotta) decide to join the mob, he would get an offer he couldn't refuse. All the racketeer, the murder, the mayhem, these Goodfellas are the ones who could do it. They would make all these other gangsters look like amateurs. My father would hang around these neighborhoods when he was working for the NYPD. He encountered a mobster one and made it out fine. Then drugs went into the fray, and the downfall begins. Joe Pesci's character Tommy DeVito was such a potty-mouth, he kills a young man for messing up, at the end, he gets his just desserts. Then Hill rounds up the people he worked for. And in that courtroom, it was in your face action. A great movie, highly compelling, and it would be great to hear more from my father, he's been there! In the 1970's that is.

ADHD Goodfellas REVIEW,"Goodfellas is a good film at its core, good story line, easy to follow and initially easy to watch.

I had to really concentrate on not getting too distracted, especially the last hour of the film, that seemed to drag.

Aesthetically the film is without a doubt one of the best films made, but plot and acting-wise(excluding DeNiro) it was annoying and mediocre. And it glorifies criminals and treason.That is one of the reasons I find the recent The Wolf of Wall Street better. And it indeed is. Ray Liotta's voice was cringe worthy and weird. DiCaprio's was smooth, soft, and sounded much more natural. And is totally a sarcastic and ironic film.So thats it. Fanboys will say that I missed the point and so on, but in the reality THEY missed the point. The film is about glorifying criminals.

A perfect Mob-movie - but....,"As always Scorcese manages to make a very ""artistic"" movie unlike all other directors. Like in the later movie ""Casino"" he let the leading actors tell the story while the pictures roll on and it is first in the later part of the movie he revolves and take up the ""normal"" movie-style with dialogue. I think that this is a perfect way of making a movie interesting but perhaps it is getting a little too used by Scorcece, because all of the movies I have seen of him, not so many, is made this way. De Niro and Pesci shows how perfect they are at acting together in a ""Mafia-movie"" and this is one of the better they made together - Casino is still my favorite. I especially like the way Pesci is acting, he is just perfect at being a crazy killer that don't take no for an answer. So I hope to see more Scorcece movies starring De Niro and Pesci, but lets make it in an other - but still unusual way Scorcese.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Average-fellas,"A true story about the New York City mobsters and the main man, Henry Hill. His rise and fall from the mob life. A film that is great in acting and storytelling of how the mobster life was like in the years ranging from 1955-1980. Great to watch for the history and what the people went through in their lives. With that said, the movie itself is just an average film which sadly shows us the fact that gangs and violence is out there in the real world.The film starts great and is amazingly well done. Martin Scorsese, the man who does very violent/crime/mob movies. And don't forget the profanity, this movie drops the F bomb. All together it doesn't affect the film. But nonetheless the movie takes you through the years with the mob family. The first act is well done, especially with meeting the characters. The second act fell flat and boring. It doesn't really hold your attention. Making you want the film to just hurry up and end. And when the end comes along it just leaves you feeling ""okay."" There is no big surprising moments, no memorable scenes. The dialogue on the other hand, plenty of famous lines.The acting was grand. Joe Pesci always outdoing himself. While again Robert De Niro does such an amazing job in his character portrayals. With Ray Liotta playing the lead role of Henry Hill who was perfect. Featuring many other actors and actresses who did such an awesome job on the film. And a surprise cameo of a young Samuel L Jackson! The list of actors and actresses was well picked for the film and everyone did a masterpiece.The story which is told from Henry and his wife's perspective. While again the film is pretty violent, it shows how it can put a toll on someone. From getting involved in fights, killings, drugs, and the overall mafia life. Eventually you are going to snap. But the way the story is told is like a long boring dull tone. Like a boring history lesson. A slow paced story. How the story is told of what really happen is just what you may read in a biography book. It is average, entertaining if you like that sort of thing. Not saying Scorsese did a bad job on the movie. ""Goodfellas"" just feels overrated.Overall the movie is a straightforward average film. Ranging from the beginning to interesting to the ending being plain. Not a must see but if you got the time or like the mafia style films then go for it. Otherwise skipping this film will give you time to find another movie that is worth it. A greater movie suggestion would be another one of Scorsese's film, ""The Departed.""",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Every character was just plain unlikeable and by the end I didn't care who got whacked.I am totally shocked at the high rating this movie has gotten here on IMDB.

So many things can be said about this film that if I said, the next guy adding a comment will only repeat what the others have said. But I will say one thing though, Scorcese has done it. He will keep on doing it. And nothing will stop him. Unless there's a ""Goodfellas 2"" which I doubt. Well hope not.

All My Life I Wanted To Be A Gangster,"Goodfellas is one of (if not the) the best movies that Martin Scorsese has made, and the best of the gangster genre. Every frame of this movie is used to its benefit, never skimping out on details, spanning across two decades of crime, the scope is immense, but the ambitions of the filmmakers and the cast makes it all possible and create an absorbing, violent gangster thriller. The performances are all led by actors at the top of their game, Joe Pesci especially giving a manic, schizophrenic performance as a mob boss under too much pressure, holding too much power. And ultimately that's what Goodfellas is, it's a morality tale of absolute power corrupts absolutely. The technicality of the camerawork furthers the draw and appeal of this gritty film, bringing the setting and characters together, until the sobering concluding words fill the screen and the credits roll. Goodfellas is quintessential filmmaking at its finest, and one that has and will stand the test of time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
I love it!,"Goodfellas is a film that set the bar for all other films in the same vein, including Martin Scorsese's Casino. It is intriguing that Scorsese can redefine the genre once more with another film.Goodfellas tells the story of Henry Hill's criminal life, who narrates his own criminal past in a flashback. Henry Hill got drawn into the criminal life as a child and became a gangster. Tutored by Robert DeNiro and Paul Sorvino, he participated in one of the biggest heists of all time, Lufthansa Airlines, at JFK Airport in the seventies. Goodfellas portrays the events leading up to the heist and the aftermath from Henry Hill's perspective.The movie depicts the gangster mentality better than any other film, except maybe Sean Connery's performance in Family Business. Both Liotta and Connery operate from the same mindset: if you want something, just take it. Criminals think this way; it's the rest of us who are fools.Joe Pesci's role as Tommy DeVito is that of a criminal driven by a terrible inferiority complex due to his short stature, and he does terrible things to his peers. And those peers don't forget, as seen in Goodfellas. This turned out to be a career-defining role for Pesci, who is a multi-talented actor capable of playing everything from the Home Alone comedies to brutal killers like in Goodfellas or Casino.There is an ongoing debate among Scorsese fans about whether Casino or Goodfellas is better. Without the success of Goodfellas, Casino would not have been made.Goodfellas is a must-see movie for anyone interested in a fascinating look at the criminal mindset.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

"Martin's short and sweet real life mob film that shows crime life pays with excess, but in the end it all breaks!","Finally watched Martin Scorsese's classic crime drama thriller 1990's ""Goodfellas"" and I wasn't surprised I knew what to expect as Martin's films involve most of the time New York, crime, and the real tales of the mob underworld. The film is powerful with it's crime, drama and human emotion as blood and greed is spilled while racking up power and excess only as with most morality stories all of it comes crashing down in the end. The chemistry is fantastic with the all star cast of Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, Lorraine Bracco and one of my favorites Joe Pesci. It tells the real life story of small time crook and criminal Henry Hill(Ray Liotta)who climbs up the ranks of the mob underworld after taking part in a big time robbery. And his partner in crime is the big boss James Conway(DeNiro)and thru it all it's a struggle with his trophy wife Karen(Lorraine Bracco)as despite the times of big money and diamonds Henry has a mistress on the side to drive Karen crazy!

What can you say...he was a Goodfellas.,"20 years ago Marty Scorsese put out a movie that was so entertaining, so full of great dialogue that we've(at least I have) been quoting it ever since.The fact that your probably never get another Deniro, Pesci, Scorsese collaboration again is enough of a reason to worship this work. The rapid cuts, the great crazy camera movement and the fact that soooo many actors were in this movie for small parts(i.e. see Tobin Bell and Samuel L.

"Timeless and epic, brutal and unflinching.","As far back as Henry Hill can remember, he always wanted to be a gangster. His dreams are realized early on in his childhood as he ascends the ranks of the mafia in Brooklyn, NY and then finds his life descending into a downward spiral that forces him out of society altogether. This is his true story, adapted from a novel by Nicholas Pileggi and brought to the screen by writer/director Martin Scorsese.Authenticity plays a big role in the film. Because it is a true story about real people, it would be nothing if the characters didn't feel authentic. Thankfully we have the great Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci (who subsequently won an Oscar for his role) along with Ray Liotta (in, no doubt, his finest role) bringing the players in the film to life so naturally. Nothing these actors do is over-done nor glamorized in any way. In fact, it's almost as if the trio personally knew the people they were portraying before committing their interpretations to film. For all of their character flaws and ugliness, nothing is sugar-coated, and the film is the better for it. Of course, it helps with a solid supporting cast that includes Paul Sorvino, Lorraine Bracco, and Frank Sivero. Bracco, in particular, gives the viewer someone to live through the experience with, as she witnesses and comes to term with the shocking reality she must adapt to.The film is no doubt violent and brutal, but is delivered with a touch of class as only Martin Scorsese can bring to the game. This film alone is a testament to his status as one of America's finest film-makers. Conjuring up images that will stay with you long after your first viewing, Scorsese makes the ultra-violence as real as it should be and brings only the finest performances out of even the smallest players in the pack. Helping to commit the film to memory is a brilliant soundtrack of popular tunes that spans three decades and serves as a stunning example of popular music used effectively in cinema. If you remember one thing about ""Goodfellas,"" it may very well be Eric Clapton's ""Layla"" and the grisly and haunting images that accompany it.Without a doubt, ""Goodfellas"" is one of the finest mob films ever made and, at the very least, is certainly one of Scorsese's best. From the cast to the music and everything in between, it is complete, sweet and sensational perfection. View it, and you'll see why it was such a smashing success and why it is still considered a classic almost 20 years later.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
What else is there to say?,"IMDb has been around, what, 8-9 years now? I'm sure many people have said better than me what is so great about Goodfellas. Ain't really nuttin' to say other than if I had maybe five pictures to take with me to a deserted island where I (somehow) had a DVD player, I'd definitely take this one. Joe Pesci in a lacerating, blistering performance of psychosis and self-hatred, Robert DeNiro playing a confident, psychotic, but also ambitious and highly- motivated Mafia hit-man. Paul Sorvino, radiating menace, Lorraine Bracco, particularly in her early scenes where she is intrigued and unsure what to make of up-and-coming don Henry Hill (Ray Liotta). One can sense her belief that perhaps she shouldn't be so entranced by him, but as she says after she hides the gun that Henry her, Some girls would be appalled, turned off, by such violence on their behalf but I found it a turn-on. The use of music in the film is wonderful, the cinematography, particularly in the edgy scene in January 1980 when...well, you know. and yeah, absolutely the best use ever (by a long shot) of voice-overs. Liotta's Hill is the apparently normal guy whose sympathetic narration give the film its connection to a supposedly reasonable person. The story is amazing, the acting is amazing, and the depiction of a Mob in which everything is not peachy keen for those making out like bandits (no pun intended) seems fair (not that I'd know....really..).

A true Scorcesse classic,"I was shocked to see that Goodfellas lost to Dances with the Wolves for best picture. I am not saying that that movie was bad but i am saying Goodfellas is a thousand times better than that movie.  All actors are in top form, Liotta quite possibly gives the best performance of his life, Deniro is just Deniro and Joe Pesci yea well he got an oscar for it so i can't say anything else.  The movie revolves around 3 best friends (Liotta, Deniro and Pesci) who work their way up in the mafia crime organization, thats not just it, it has liotta's (Henry Hill) personal life involved too, we see steady character changes and developments as the movie goes on.  The movie is flawless. I give it 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
goodfellas should rate much higher,"although the godfather trilogy has been more critically acclaimed (at least the first two films in the trilogy) goodfellas showed a humorous side that made its non-stop, hard edged portrayal of mafia life and the violence that accompanies that life even more engrossing as the film plays out and the main character shows us how what was once a glamorous lifestyle became his downfall. in addition it does an excellent job of portraying how its easy allure traps not only Henry (Ray Liotta)but Karen (Lorraine Bracco)and how when someone is no longer an asset to the family, just how disposible they are. the film also introduced the mass film audience to two talented people in Ray Liotta and the beautiful Lorraine Brocco. Its also a crime that Martin Scorcaise did not win an acadamy award as best director.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"""I'm sorry I got blood on your floor....""","Goodfellas is Martin Scorsese's Magnum Opus based on real-life ex-made mobster Henry Hill's 1985 best-selling book, ""Wiseguys"". A tour de force, brilliantly directed and acted by 1990's finest group of mob movie actors. Every scene is thoughtfully pieced together; from the beginning we see Ray Liotta's Henry as a young teen hoodlum, growing up in Brooklyn in the mid 1950's, hanging around low-level Mafia types, running numbers and selling hijacked cigarettes. His meeting a young Tommy De Vito, played older by a riveting Joe Pesci, who's psychotic personality turns the movie on its' head during the first 2 acts, giving it a maniacal, trigger happy feel, only to be reigned in by his cousin, Jimmy Conway, played with typical aplomb by Robert DeNiro. Together, the three make a formidable shakedown mob team, making lots of dirty money by hook or crook, via hijacking, murder, and arson for their boss, Paulie Cicero, played with great dead-eyed, deliberate gusto by Paul Sorvino.The movie soundtrack is rock and roll at its' best with a slew of Rolling Stones tunes mixed in with a hodge podge of 60's and 70's tunes as the movie moves thru the gang's paces and hits from year to year, culminating in the December, 1978 heist of a Lufthansa plane carrying $6MM in cash at La Guardia Airport in NYC. By this time Henry and his wife, Karen are addicted to and dealing large quantities of cocaine. The movie follows the couples' 1980's highs and lows with them getting busted and going into the FBI's Witness Protection Program after testifying in open court against their former mob buddies.Whenever the movie comes on TV, I can't resist watching, albeit with much of the dialogue bleeped out, it's still up there with ""The Godfather I & II"" as the greatest mob movies of all-time.

Goodfellas found itself the unlikely,"Few weeks ago, as if inadvertently anticipating its 30th anniversary this month, Goodfellas found itself the unlikely subject of a Twitter flame war, kicked off by one non-admiring podcaster's viral tweet.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Scorsese on Scorsese; Scorsese's best...Or the best I've seen up to now,"Martin Scorsese has had a delicate career. I'm not saying he has had bad times as a director; I'm talking about his recognition as the pro he is. And I'm talking about the times he was overlooked, even with this movie, which is without doubt the best work he has done (or at least the best I've seen). I don't want to say what everyone says but we've seen Marty lost his Oscars with actors turned directors in those that for most people where his best movies.But many people waste a lot of time talking about those things; and I'm writing about ""Goodfellas"". Yes, that Scorsese movie that is so his as most of his projects are. That movie, one of the few directed by Scorsese that he also wrote, in collaboration with Nicholas Pileggi; who would write with him again for ""Casino"", a movie I haven't seen but I watched some parts and there's a clear parallel. In ""Casino"", it's a guy talking about how the casino works; the movement. The guy works in the casino. In ""Goodfellas"", it's a guy narrating his life as a gangster. He's a gangster, and if you don't realize at the beginning, it'll happen soon when he starts by: ""As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster"". ""Goodfellas"" is based on a true story, about characters that really existed and could have had talks with the movie's main actors.There's an unusual magic in cinema when it comes to narration; and this is one of the first movies that dealt with that. Frank Darabont was having doubts as he was writing his first feature, based on a book, as ""Goodfellas"" is. He was writing and discovered he was using a lot of narration, he was afraid it wouldn't work. Only just then he sat and watched ""Goodfellas"" again, and probably again and again""The heck"", he must have said. ""This is pure narration"". Of course that movie is ""The Shawshank Redemption"", today a classic and personally one of my favorite scripts.When you experience main characters narrating the story, it's something unique. I've recently seen ""Paid in full"", where Ace, the main character, is telling a story. He takes us to the past once we saw a glance of the presents, and talks quietly and not so much so we can presence the story. This atmosphere came before with ""Goodfellas"", where Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) talks, after we see a brief glance in a time we'll see after. He introduces us to everyone and to his most united friends; Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci). Henry's both friends are not telling the story; he is. So we know that no matter what, Henry won't be dead at the ending. He'll survive because he can't be telling the story from heaven; not when he stops and talks directly to the audience in some shots. In ""Paid in full"", Ace is a good man, and we want the best for him, because we know the persons around him and how they can influence him. He narrates the story; he's our hero.""Goodfellas"" is another type of enchantment: where no hero exists; where we are just contemplating the story and not taking any sides. Is Henry the hero because he tells the story? No; neither Jimmy or Tommy. This is achieved by a wonderful script; trapping and palpable. As in ""Paid in full"", we get to know everyone: women (lovers or wives), who are always there for men. This is dealt with complexity, because some men have only lovers, but another are married and also need a company. The important wife role was in Lorraine Bracco's hands. Karen was in love of a violent and dangerous guy that was exciting because of what she turned into when being with him; and the future she predicted by his side. This is all correctly managed in Bracco's astonishing performance.We get to know the boss; that type of man knew in movies like ""The Godfather"". The man who doesn't talk to anyone personally, is calmed, and available when needed in extreme situations. He's Paul Cicero, played by Paul Sorvino, in a performance that compares silence with noise...In the business environment, people come and go, with short dialogues; and you understand who does what...It's all too big to be described.Ray Liotta carries with the weight of the movie somehow, in one of his ever best performances, adding original changes because of all the different transformations his character suffers. Joe Pesci, with one Oscar he'll always thank to Scorsese, steals the show with the movie's best lines and scenes in his hands. De Niro was already a pro at that time, butIt is something amazing to see him in any performance. He graces the screen with his way of talking, making each moment memorable; and that's one thing not many actors can't achieve. I didn't use to admire him as an actor; but I'm starting to realize, and Scorsese has a lot to do with that.With that and with everything, Marty is hidden behind every little detail in this film. Again, he puts his own visions into the screen, so you can see he's there. Sometimes his camera knows more than the storyteller; sometimes it knows nothing, and it really doesn't need toIt can be living the moment, or planning that violence Scorsese is always willing to release, just to mix it with the characters' deepest feelings.Scorsese, like Jimmy, Henry, Tommy or any other says; is a ""good fella"". ""He's with us, he's OK, you can hang out with him; he's a good fellaYou know?"". And his ""Goodfellas"" is another underrated cinematographic brilliance; as one of those all-time movie classics.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Short and Sweet,"If it were not for The Godfather, this would be the best mob movie ever made. Ray Liotta as Henry Hill was fantastic. Joe Pesci plays the sickest SOB on the planet.

A mob movie classic,"Watching a lot of The Offer recently and it has me in the mood to revisit class Mafia films.Goodfellas is definitely a mob movie classic and while I love Martin Scorsese's direction in this film I don't personally view it as one of the greatest films or mobster films of all time. Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro give phenomenal performances and I enjoy Joe Pesci as an actor but he's character is just one of the things I hate most about this film. I'm sure I'm in minority with that opinion or perhaps completely alone but his character is just utterly loud and annoying I didn't shed a tear upon Tommy's death.Still my favorite crime drama and best mobster film of all time to me is The Godfather. The Godfather has been a bar of excellent film making, a cornerstone of mob films and a genre defining film.

Beyond the genius adaptation of Nick Pileggi's tell-all, ""True Crime"" book, you have enormous performances by almost everyone in the film. Ray Liotta is off the chart as Henry Hill, Pesci is extremely disturbing as Tommy, DeNiro is insanely good as Jimmy, Paul Sorvino was never better and Lorraine Bracco's turn as Karen sends the whole project into overdrive.

He stole the show with his crazy, cowboy-like character, Tommy. His cussing and killing is so convincing, it makes Pesci look like the type of guy that would really blow a guy's head off in real life. Liotta showed that he has the talent to lead a movie, and do it sucessfully. DeNiro shows once again why he is considered to be one of the greatest actors of all time.

Such a great movie,"And yet the ending felt like a copout, an anticlimactic way for the filmmakers to get out of coming up with something better. This movie deserved a great ending, and it got a quick job instead. But maybe that's as it should be. Maybe there was no better way to end this incredible movie. It's a true story, so obviously the movie had to end a certain way. However, considering the talent involved, you'd expect something more.But however much I didn't like the ending was a quarter of how much I liked the rest of the movie. Maybe this isn't how the mob actually works, but the way Martin Scorcese films it seems about as realistic as a movie could get. The narrator takes us into the inner workings of the mob, explaining how everything is done and what everyone's job is. Of course, that would mean nothing without good characters, and the main character, Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), is a great one. Not a great person, mind you; he's wanted to be in the mob all his life and the movie chronicles all sorts of nasty things he and his colleagues do to other people. But the character is great, partially because Liotta is so magnetizing. One of my friends thinks Liotta is the worst in the movie, but I don't think so. We see everything from his perspective, so we actually don't see a whole lot of him. But when we do, the movie is on.Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro give good performances as Hill's best friends, and Pesci deserved his Oscar for being a hothead that causes the mob a lot of trouble. But I really think Liotta takes the best performance in the movie and his was definitely an underrated one. Lorraine Bracco is also effective and versatile as Hill's wife. The two of them are more than convincing from beginning to end and the movie would not be the same without them.Martin Scorcese has made a brilliant movie, never boring, always alive. He's obviously a master director, but that darn endingmaybe the next time I see the movie the ending won't bug me so much. Maybe I'm overreacting. I certainly wouldn't want my qualms about the resolution to keep anyone from seeing such an incredible film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

most impressive mob movie,"I've seen many mob movies,until now,this one is the best~I was deeply shocked while watching this movie the first time,and then within 24 hours I just watched it again.To me it's far better than other movies related with Mafia. From the beginning I was attracted by Henry's legendary life...he's really a perfect guy,agile,flexible,ambitious.lovable...except for choosing the run way, in some way he's my idol~ Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci's performed great,too.De Niro still as a cold-blood killer,he seems to be specialized in acting this kind of character..and Pesci still acted as a nut..crazy and dangerous and disgusting nut like he acted in Casino.The camera shots was concise and the rhythm was quickly,it's hard to believe that this movie was casted in 1990, thanks to the director Martin Scorsese.. And after my second watch i got more info,every game has it's rules,and joining Mafia is just like playing a dangerous and exciting game,rules also exist,at the beginning of the movie Herry was told by Jimmy never sold off friends,and always keep mouth shut,later Paul admonished him never touch drugs,Those are the prime rules,but apparently Herry broke them all,he got involved in drug dealing,and caught by cops,then afraid of being killed,he sold up the whole family,It's rather interesting,Herry is a smart guy in the Mafia group,but he was just too smart and ambitious,and finally led to his doom,and destroyed the whole family by keep on breaking rules.Tommy did the same thing,killed Batt without the confirmation from upper class,and got revenge..Jimmy also made stupid mistakes,he tried to set up Herry's wife,but failed,then he ordered Henry to kill someone,he must know that the Herries are very wise people,so it's really hard to believe why he left so many hints for them to fight back,whilst Paul is rather pathetic,he got fooled by Herry for once,and too Mercy to let him go,but he underestimated the effect of this drug cases,that led to his doom. I think the Chinese translation about the film name is very vivid,(Dao Yi you Dao)literally means Even being a thief has it's rules. But some of the plots are really hard to understand,especially the painting drawn by Tommy's mother when Tommy killed Batts,it was rather weird,Tommy killed Batts,then his mother show the painting exactly like Batts,and there's two dogs behind,one head for east,the other head for west,does that implicit anything??",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

One of the best films ever made,"While Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" saga focuses on the highest levels of a crime family, Martin Scorcese's ""Goodfellas"" tells the story of a family from the lower levels.The story starts in Brooklyn 1955 where young Henry Hill becomes an errand boy for the local mobsters. He meets and becomes friends with Jimmy Conway (Robert DeNiro) and young Tommy DeVito. He earns the respect of the crew after he is pinched for selling illegal cigarettes and doesn't rat out his friends.We then flash forward to Henry (Ray Liotta) and Tommy (Joe Pesci) in their twenties, where they are still trying to steal everything they can get their hands on. The two pull of a daring robbery of Air France, scoring almost $ 400,000.Henry meets and eventually marries Karen (Lorraine Bracco), a no-nonsense Jewish girl. In one of the best sequences of any Scorcese picture, Henry walks with Karen through the kitchen of the famous New York restaurant, the Copacabana (this shot was imitated in ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Swingers."") All is going well until Henry and Jimmy get sent to prison. Henry starts selling cocaine and eventually becomes hooked.In the most entertaining sequences of the film (title card reads Sunday May 11, 1980), Henry must coordinate several different things in one day -- cooking dinner for his family, delivering silencers to Jimmy, picking up and preparing cocaine for some customers near Atlanta. The entire montage is set to several great classic rock songs, including Harry Nillson's ""Jump Into The Fire"", George Harrison's ""What Is Life"", The Who's ""Magic Bus"" and The Rolling Stones ""Monkey Man."" One of Scorcese's strongest points has always been his musical selections, especially in ""Goodfellas"" This is Scorcese's masterpiece and it should not be missed.

GoodFellas,"A captivating, engaging and storytelling masterpiece.This movie does an amazing job with narration, it's written so well and makes a complicated story easily understandable. The movie really shows the connections between the characters but also the fine line between life and death, friends and enemies. It shows how when you have connections with so many powerful people eventually you'll become one as well, it shows how you can elevate yourself with, intelligence, courage and being wise guys. The film also shows how power can ruin people, make them look good but corrupt their soul and emotion, creating a soulless being. The acting in this movie is also realistic and intimidating. The atmosphere is another highlight, the dark gloomy setting is perfect for the story and plot development. Overall one of the best mafia films ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
The standard bearer for all gangster films,"If I had my way, this is the film that all gangster & violence films should be measured up against. It sets all the standards which some films have since lived up to but most have failed miserably.Dare I say it, it's better than Godfather 1 & probably even part 2, and that takes some doing.The main reason, is the plot is kept simple, there's just the right amount of characters. Even Godfather 1 -if you can find a fault with it- probably has just one or two extra Italians to confuse you slightly.This is gangster films & even films generally, at it's best.Sure there's some gruesome & heartless scenes, and I felt for the innocent postman, but they fit in perfectly with the context of the film and create exactly the mood.Of course, the main reason is that it's based on true accounts which you can easily believe. If only others in the film industry would try to do likewise.9.5/10 if such a vote existed, it doesn't so 10/10.Alongside only Star Wars, Great Escape, Shawshank Redemption & the Magnificent 7 out of 300 films. That's pretty good company.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Literally my favourite film,"It's hard to put into words exactly why this is my favourite film, or what it is that makes it so flawless.Perhaps it's the ambitious way the scenes are put together. Many film makers would take a scene like Pesci's ""Funny how?"" rant or the one take walk into the Copacabana and say ""You know what, that's the highlight, the whole film will revolve around that"". Not Scorsese though, it's almost as if he tried to better himself in every scene and in many ways, he did just that.I look at the 2 and a half hour run time and find it very difficult to think of what could be cut. Whether it's the wedding scene, the scene at Tommy's mother's house, or the montage showing prison life. Almost every scene in this film is a lesson in what good film making should be, and, more importantly, enhances the story that is unfolding.It's almost as if the subject matter of the film doesn't matter. Some will see the gratuitous violence, lack of moral compass and abhorrent lifestyles on display and dismiss the film for those reasons. Goodfellas is so much more than that though, a triumph in cinematography and a masterpiece of storytelling.Many have likened this film to the Godfather series. To compare Goodfellas to The Godfather does both films a disservice though. Yes, they're both about the mafia, but the way the story is told is so different they might as well be different genres.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Good but lacks dramatic tension,"I am certainly not going to dispute the quality of film making here, as it's clear it's top notch. The acting is also very sound, with each performer (perhaps outside of De Niro who seems to be giving us his stock standard De Niro performance) is great particularly that of Joe Pesci and Lorraine Braco.While I enjoyed it, and I can kind of see why some would hold it in reverence, but Goodfellas ain't The Godfather (or even The Seprano's - which I realise came way later). I had to pause Goodfellas three times and do other things. It moves at a glacial pace with very little tension to the story to keep one invested.I saw a couple of comments over they years that years Oscar winner for Best Picture over this one - Dances with Wolves and after having completed watching that a few weeks prior, the Academy certainly got 1991 Best Picture right as to this day it's still more culturally significant than Goodfellas.Goodfellas is a good mob, it's just not a great one like everyone would lead you to believe.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Perfection,"Goodfellas is a cinematic masterpiece and a pinnacle of perfection in storytelling, direction, and acting. Martin Scorsese's unparalleled vision brings to life the gritty, enthralling world of organized crime with such authenticity that it feels like you're living the story alongside the characters. This isn't just a film-it's an experience, one that captures the allure, the chaos, and ultimately, the cost of a life lived outside the law.The performances are nothing short of iconic. Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, and Joe Pesci deliver career-defining roles, with Pesci's portrayal of Tommy DeVito being a terrifying yet darkly comedic standout. Scorsese's use of music is masterful, with every track perfectly complementing the tone and narrative, from the highs of excess to the inevitable unraveling of it all.The pacing is flawless, blending sharp dialogue, unforgettable scenes, and an unrelenting sense of tension. From the infamous ""funny how?"" sequence to the frenetic paranoia of the final act, Goodfellas never misses a beat. It's not just a crime film-it's an exploration of ambition, loyalty, and the moral decay that comes with power.Decades later, Goodfellas remains untouchable-a benchmark in filmmaking and a timeless example of cinematic perfection. A true masterpiece in every sense. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Scorsese at the top of his form.,"Scorsese is a genius.With Goodfellas, he demonstrates his full command of the medium. He uses every technique at his disposal to tell his story. He uses the camera like an artist uses a paint brush. With the use of voice over narration,freeze frame, long tracking shots,flawless editing and popular music to accentuate the atmosphere of each scene,he creates a masterpiece.He gets great performances from all his actors with an outstanding performance by Joe Pesci. Scorsese does a fabulous job of creating the feel of urgency and paranoia in the final segment. I don't think there is another director on the planet that could have translated the source material onto the screen as effectively as Scorsese has. A superb film in every respect.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Scorcese at his best,"No doubt, there are remarkable movies like Mean Street, Taxi Driver and even Ragging Bull. More contemporary ones like The Departed and Shutter Island are no less wonderful but Goodfellas is masterpiece in every way.Though personally I was disappointed in first watch as I was expecting much more from De Niro Sir, but later on I figured out, ultimately it's not his story but Ray's. Die hard fan of De Niro and Scorsese combination may get disappointed but one has to understand that no one color is better than any other. And it's just the way writer and director has chosen Ray color more over De Niro color. Despite few hard to watch graphic scenes, this one has strange sense of humor that gives different perspective of Gangsters. They are humane in every way, except the way they choose to make money and their self respect for being gangsters. On one edge, we watched Godfather-where you will laugh only if you fooled yourself for not getting story or asking why would any Don go to shop fruits, Goodfellas has funny moment one after another, between friends, enemies, police/gangster, and my favorite one is one in Joe's dining table with his mother. Joe steals the show where ever he is but as we watch him from Ray's perspective, we laugh even louder as Ray finds Joe's jokes much more funny than they actually are. I am dying to see Scorsese coming back to this phase where we get to watch, have fun and ultimately take home a huge lesson. I mean, there are movies where we see character arcs, but this one is brilliant in so many ways. It is not boring at all, and the shift in the arc is almost perpendicular as we know Ray from very beginning that all he wanted to be is Gangster and by the end of film, we see him as someone else.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Whi is this a better movie than 1995 Casino?,"I had high expectations from this based on the exteremely high (for a movie) ratings, especially considering it is rated much bigher than 1995 Casino with somewhat similar characters and plot.The answer to the question in the title is - it is not. Casino is much better. This is a bit overrated and unnecessarily protracted movie. I got bored several times throughout the movie.

Beutiful...,"This is truly on of the greatest movies I have ever seen.  It shows in beautiful detail how the criminal underground works.  The story being true only helped its accuracy.  The lead performances where perfect, especially Liota's, he really made the movie what it is.  The transformation he goes through is really amazing.The perfect balance of violence, crime, and comedy make this movie what it is.  There are enough jokes to balance off the dead bodies and the drug content.  And the cinematography is mind boggling.  The story is flawless and the ending made the whole thing worth it.  It scary to think Conway will be out of prison next year (2004)... I wonder if there will be a sequel in like 50 years about what Conway did after he got out.All and all a brilliant movie that comes so close to perfection it's scary.

"Great movie, but one point i'd like people to consider","I feel about this movie the way I feel about all Scorcese films; my one controversial contention is that they lack heart. They are so well executed, virtuosic, precise, controlled, and at the same time, a little exuberant. Still, they lack heart. Have you ever seen deep parts of yourself in his characters or in his worlds, have you ever recognized, as one might, in the look of a Wes Anderson film, or even in the playful inventiveness of Back to the Future, a world that feels new and familiar at the same time, particular and general, some world or situation or feeling that you feel has been in you forever though you're only recognizing it now. Do you feel deeply about any of them? Simply put, do they move you? Perhaps an answer of 'No' to these questions does not indicate a deficiency. But out of the best works of art I want that phenomenon of meeting myself in something separate from me, a new and yet familiar part of myself, that sense of expansion, that presentiment of a mysterious and universal beauty. Given that, though, I do not hesitate to say that Scorcese's films are compelling, and furthermore, that Goodfellas ranks high among them. I am involved in its story easily and always when I run across it on TV. Just remembering the cocaine helicopter pasta sauce sequence makes me think well of the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"A Legendary, Perfect Movie That Must Be Seen to Be Believed","Goodfellas might be the best movie ever made. The level of ""perfection"" reached in it has only been seen maybe a handful of times. Scorcese operated on another level with making this incredible work of art.Talk about iconic, this film came out in 1990 and was an instant smash hit and classic. Several main actors were already considered great, but this movie may have cemented them as legendary. Even newcomer, Ray Liotta, who landed the role of a lifetime, became an instant star for his part among the veterans. DeNiro, Pesci, and the others all have an on screen chemistry that is unforgettable and rarely seen. Future Sopranos standout Lorraine Bracco also got her fame here, the part that paved her way for the future role on the hit TV series.Everything in this movie works down to every shot, edit, music, and lighting choices. Really, the only downside is that some of the source material is dark and violent; but it's based on the true story of Henry Hill, who spent his entire life in the mafia. This is what it was really like, and Scorcese does a fine job keeping it entertaining and realistic.Scorcese delivers a master class on filmmaking here. Problem is, nobody is ever going to match it; they'll just be too busy watching in awe at how untouchable his level of mastery is. Goodfellas is easily one of the top 5 crime dramas ever made, probably more like top 3, and arguably the best crime drama ever made. A must see classic.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
"Not good, a great movie about some really bad fellas","Goodfellas is one of the best mafia films you'll ever been blessed to see in your lifetime, right down to the letter in terms of acting, directing, but especially scripting. I have this fantastic script in book form, where the film honors the script one hundred percent. Goodfellas is quite a scary movie in terms of it's character's attributes, the main one being Pesci's, his Tommy, played with such a haunting ferocity. This is the most scary performance I've seen in a mafia film. He makes the character he played in Casino, Nicky Santori, look tame, although the the two bare some resemblances, especially in the violence and recklessness department. The story is told through the eyes of mafia figure, Henry Hill, played superbly by Ray Liotta, his most notable performance, when the mentioning of this actor's name comes up. Hill who died a while back, had described the mafia as a dark and terrifying world as seen through this brilliant film. It's through his eyes we meet these characters, like Jimmy the Gent, Conway, De Niro excelling himself again, and also Paul Sorvino as Paulie Cicero, a Sicilian godfather less threatening cause of his laid back manner, but looks can be deceiving. We move through Henry's wannabe mafia type, from childhood, that had him skipping school, subjecting him to a whacking from his father here and there, right through to his two incarcerations, where after getting out of the second one, thanks to his mother in law who puts up bail, he is soon making a deal of immunity. Reasons. One, his wife (Bracco) who goes to see Deniro is pointed towards this alley where all these coats are hanging. Should she go in there? No, why? Cause she'll probably get whacked. She options to quickly take off instead. To me, this was the most terrifying moment in this near two and a half hour film. Two, the other reason, Deniro asks Liotta to whack a guy down in Miami, and knows that if he accepts this, he won't came back alive. Death is shown so cheaply here, where if you don't do the right thing, the probability of living is null. One of the hoods, Stax, played by Samuel L Jackson in one of it's memorable bloody scenes, is one such an example, where a montage of other victims follow. Goodfellas has some real bloody moments, one involving a connected guy who's celebrating, getting out, on Henry's Hill's actual birthday, where his mouth earns him a helluva of a bashing, followed by a freshly dug grave. When it comes to violence, this movie is uncompromising, but these thugs existed. Again at Goodfellas's end, as to Hill's living arrangements, once more we see that crime just doesn't pay, but it pays bloody well to seen this 1990 classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Great gangster film,"Goodfellas is definitely one of the best gangster movies I have ever seen. Martin Scorsese directed this film perfectly with a pistol whipping cast. This film is based on a true story about Henry Hill, and how he strives from a kid to an adult to be a gangster in the life of the Italian mafia. The film is set between 1955 and the late 1970's in East New York, Brooklyn.The cast is filled with some of the biggest stars of the early nineties. Including Ray Liotta, who played the main character Henry Hill. Along with Robert De Niro as Jimmy Conway, also known as Jimmy ""the gem"", and Joe Pesci who played Tommy DeVito. These actors do an outstanding job on screen of portraying the classic gangster theme. I could not be distracted throughout watching this film. It literally sucked me into the story.Martin Scorsese did an outstanding job with the cast, production, music, and the story of the gangster life in New York. Henry Hill wanted to be a gangster since he was a kid. Watching the gangsters around the neighborhood, he desired more and more to be like them. He was intrigued from the start and wanted a life of no limits. Henry, Jimmy, and Tommy were a great trio of hardcore gangsters who demanded respect and didn't take crap from anyone.The film is full of countless gangsters with a great script and superb music and sound. The soundtrack really pulled me into the era of the 60's and 70's. The costumes and clothes were done very well. The costume and makeup design mirrored the era very well. The film also had a great amount of gangster crime and violence that kept my attention the whole time.The lighting in the film was mostly dark. Some of these scenes were in a club and bars so it matched perfectly for a gangster setting. Scorsese also did well during a scene where the trio was digging up an old friend and the lighting was dark and foggy. The lighting in this scene also had a red tint to it. Another great scene was a classic slow motion up close shooting by tommy DeVito. You can see each empty shell fly out of the pistol in slow motion. The communication of the brutal violence of the mafia was well received.Overall, the film had every element of the gangster life. The film told the story very well and kept me entertained as much as when I was watching The Godfather. Both are classic gangster films that will never be forgotten for years to come.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Timeless,"It's the original, full-length music video. To me, the way Scorsese features the music as a main character truly keeps me coming back year after year. More accurately, it could be seen as the ultimate DJ set. Or visual remix. Taking so many beautiful elements, visually and audibly, and bring all elements together at their most dynamic points. There's a shamanistic quality to that skill. So I can honestly say, I FEEL better, because I use this film in a medicinal way, when I watch it.Quick note, if you haven't seen GF and haven't seen Casino... WATCH GF First.

"The greatest Gangster film that I have seen, it does something that even The Godfather, did not do.","The greatest Gangster film that I have seen, it does something that even The Godfather, did not do.Here is a film on organized crime that is having a voice over of it's protagonist for good amount of time and it makes the film all the more interesting. I love many shots in the film, like the conversation shots between Paulie and Henry, or the way jokes of Joe Pesci are captured or even the murders. Damn, this is all very realistic and it's admirable to have achieved it this way. Indeed at times it plays like a documentary unlike a fiction film. Also, the film is told in first person not only by Henry but also by his wife Karen. Damn, it makes the film reliable and real.The performances are superb, each detail, each nuance is done well, nothing seems out of place, a jaw dropping murder of rib tickling joke, all seem so natural in emotions here. Joe Pesci gets out some wonderful lines. Robert DeNiro is extremely cold blooded as Jimmy. Paul Sorvino as Paulie is authoritative. Loranne Bracco as Karen is loving. Ray Liotta as Henry is infectious and fragile. There is a host of other characters that are wonderful too.We must understand that these characters actually existed in reality and from their interviews was the book, Wise Gy written by Nicolas Pilleggi. GoodFellas was based on this book only. Scorsese is indeed the most interesting director of our times, who takes varied themes and puts it all in the pan and cooks it so well that the dish surely tastes delicious.To showcase power, he takes an interesting point where Henry takes his Karen into a restaurant by surpassing the crowd, going through the back door and a table is literally lifted and placed for them. To showcase guilt, Scorsese uses conversation between Jimmy and Henry. To showcase crime, he shows us just a few gunshots and how emotionless the killer is. Damn, all this makes it such interesting and a fun film. The camera movement is adept and so is the cinematographer. But to dive the camera and the cameraman, the director is needed. Scorsese precisely is such director.This is not actually a Gangster film, I will rather call it as a film that is made on Organised Crime in a throughly interesting way and with eccentric and interesting characters. Of course, the cast does get all the chords right and takes the characters into a new level.It is indeed long with a length of 140 minutes, but it's an easy film for a movie buff. But for the non-aficionados the characters names and the length may take a toll. But I will say, most film-goers have considered this a good film as per ratings all over, thus even the claim that it is lengthy can be cut off.I am giving 5/5 for this wonderful film, that is self indulgent at times, but the best part is that it indulges you as viewer.

Fantastic,"GoodFellas isn't just about crime; it's about the human condition. Scorsese captures the allure of forbidden fruit, the fragility of trust, and the inevitability of betrayal.

It's a raw, unapologetic look at a world where loyalty is currency and survival is everything.So, if you haven't experienced the rollercoaster ride of ""GoodFellas,"" grab some cannoli, turn up the volume, and let Scorsese take you on a journey you won't forget.

By the contrary! No, this can be enjoyed by anyone who doesn't mind:A). Violence (against wife, and others, resulting half the time in death). B). Drugs (in the last hour, but still...). C). language (and LOTS of it; the Trivia says the 'F' word is used 246 times).Other than THAT, it's not too bad.

Goodfellas cements its spot as one of the greatest films of all time,"Goodfellas is easily one of the greatest movies of all time. Hands down, it is one of the few movies that has left a long lasting impression, one that will always be memorable. Martin Scorsese is definitely on top of his game and Goodfellas has definitely cemented a spot in his impressive resume, along with Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Casino, The Departed, and The Wolf of Wall Street. It's not hard to see why Goodfellas is such a critically acclaimed movie and still a very popular movie amongst film fans.Based on the non-fiction novel Wise Guy by Nicholas Pileggi (who also wrote the screenplay along with Martin Scorsese, Goodfellas tells the story of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta who puts in an explosive performance in his best role to date) and his rise and fall in his career with the mafia throughout the 1950's and the 1980's. He starts off as a young boy running errands and as time goes on, he earns his reputation as a feared gangster however such acts including adultery, murder, and drug use contribute to his downfall. His fellow friends and gangsters throughout his time in the mafia include his childhood friend the sociopath Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci who deservedly won the 1990 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor) and the slick, calculating and volatile Jimmy Conway who also enjoys hijacking and robbing trucks (Robert De Niro in another memorable performance). The mob boss is Paulie Cicero (Paul Sorvino), a man who commands respect and fear, and rules over the crime family with an iron first including Henry Hill, Tommy DeVito and Jimmy Conway. Henry Hill's wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco, well known as the psychologist Dr Jennifer Melfi from The Sopranos) finds herself seduced by her husband's glamorous lifestyle but nothing lasts forever when Henry's criminal activities and behaviour impede into their personal lives.Without question this is Martin Scorsese's finest movie. There's not one bad thing that can be said about this movie. The cast is first rate, the entire story and screenplay is excellent, and Martin Scorsese as the director does a very commendable job. Throughout the entire 146 minutes, there is not a dull moment nor is there a minute wasted. There are endless classic scenes in Goodfellas that I could not even start to list them. The clever use of the soundtrack with all the songs intertwined with many scenes from the movie makes Goodfellas even more memorable at another level. Every time I hear the piano exit from Layla by Derek and The Dominos, I am instantly reminded of Goodfellas.Goodfellas is a movie with a reputation for being violent with 300 uses of the f... word. In no way does Martin Scorsese pull any punches, nor does he aim to glamorise life in the mafia or the criminal lifestyle. The violence is realistic, cold, and unflinching, and this is certainly not a movie for everyone.Unfortunately Goodfellas was unfairly robbed of many Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director among others. Though Martin Scorsese finally earns a long overdue Academy Award for The Departed in 2006, he deserved to win Best Director for Goodfellas.Goodfellas earns its spot as one of the finest movies of all time, and is definitely one of my favourite movies that will never soon be forgotten.A well deserved 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Goodfellas,"Goodfellas, a film that immediately grabs your attention and doesn't let go to the final credits. The film runs for almost Two and a halve hours but one would never notice the time racing away due to brilliant structure and narrative. Henry's Narration gives this film a calming effect, he never shouts he just tells the story as if he being investigated by the cops. With the narrative, the films rolls like a dream. The pacing is perfect and not once do you hang around the same scene.In these two hours, you learn how Henry always wanted to be a gangster. He tells you this in the first three minutes of the film. 10 minutes later, he a gangster and from here on, you witness the power and glamour you receive when everyone knows who you are. The acting is brilliant. Ray Liotta gives a outstanding performance while Joe Pesci is steals every scene he in . DeNiro role is not as large as one would like but he still gives a strong presence.The Art design is another brilliant achievement . The world around you is portrayed perfectly that you can't help but be dragged into the setting.

A Total Classic,"Let me just say that while I don't think this is a perfect film, it's a total classic. Do I think that sometimes it's a bit overrated because a lot of film critics or film teachers claim it's perfect? Yeah, but do I enjoy it? Yeah I do. I also think it deserves a lot of credit, because it does a whole lot of great things.This film is a big sprawling story, following a gangster over the many years of his life. You really feel like you've witnessed his life once you reach the end of the film. The film is very fast paced and can quickly give you lots of information in a short amount of time, and I think it does it well. However I feel that Scorsese's later films such as Casino or The Wolf Of Wallstreet have this same style, but do it better. But Goodfellas should still be respected.There are tons of great performances here. Everyone does a great job and just feels natural. It has an almost documentary feeling because everyone just seems like they aren't acting, but just living their lives. It really helps strengthen the film.To me, it's not a perfect film, but it's a movie that should be seen, especially if you're a fan of films or a film maker. It's a classic and deserves to be respected.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Classic Mafia Cinema,"Good fellas was directed by master director Martin Scorcese and is probabaly his best.  It tells the story of an Irish-Italian protaginist, Henry Hill, who starts out running errands for his friendly mafia neighbours to becoming a made man.  It brings us through the traditional and exciting avenues of an Italian crime syndicate from the the fifties to the eighties. The cast is also exceptional.  Ray Liotta plays the main character and his close friend and mentor is played by Robert DeNiro, the definitive actor to play a gangster.  The rest of the cast is filled with actors who play mafiosos in many other crime movies.  The movie is really a story told in the first person by the main character, Henry Hill, of the perks of being involved in the mafia and the sudden betrayl and the self-centeredness that the mob can entail.It's truly a great picture that should be seen by everybody whoo has any interest in crime or crime dramas.

"Goodfellas (1990) - As Far Back as I Can Remember, I Always Wanted to Be a Gangster!","Considered as one of Martin Scorsese's timeless classics, ""Goodfellas"" is probably one of the greatest films to ever be made. Based on the true memoir of the Lucchese crime family, later turned into an book entitled ""Wiseguy"", by Nicholas Pileggi, ""Goodfellas"" shows the memoir of Henry Hill, and his association with his infamous crime family, as they go through the rises and falls of their lives. In a terrific all-star cast, Scorsese has gathered some of the biggest names in movies from Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, Paul Sorvino, Lorraine Bracco, and Joe Pesci, all delivering one memorable performance after the other. Ray Liotta and Lorraine Bracco, however, steal most of the screen time, both delivering respective performances, and they know how to show their stuff. Although delivered limited screen time, Robert De Niro and Paul Sorvino delivered memorable performances, revealing how they became stars in the first place. But it's Joe Pesci's Oscar-winning performance that makes the movie, stealing almost every scene he's in. Director Martin Scorsese has totally knocked the ball out of the park with this movie. ""Goodfellas"" is the movie that precisely shows how extraordinary a director that Scorsese is. He perfectly captures the true gangster life, and tells the story in such a brilliant profession. Everything about this movie is filmmaking at it's finest. From the incredible performances by the ensemble cast, the brilliant well-written dialouge, directing, editing, cinematography, and music. By the way, this movie has some of the best writing ever put to film. The dialouge feels authentic and realistic, and it reveals the realism of it all. The violence is brutal and bloody, and some moments will leave you speechless. It doesn't matter if you're a fan of gangster films, or film in general, everybody will find something to love in ""Goodfellas"". Although this movie lost the Best Picture Oscar to ""Dances with Wolves"" in 1990, ""Goodfellas"" was a more better choice. This is an authentic, powerful, and excellent piece of work from the great Martin Scorsese. This is also one of my favorite movies of all time. ""Goodfellas"", in my review, ""original and authentic, an excellent masterpiece"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

A classic mob movie with legends of the screens such as Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro, and Joe Pesci even Debbi Mazar. A great example and display of all worthy and made men: women. Take notes and beware. Lol! WARNING: THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR THE PEOPLE WITH WEAK STOMACH. You will get your thrill of kills, death, gore and sure as hell enough of violence.

Marty didn't edit this well enough,"Seven stars. I think that's because it came in with such a huge reputation,
and because I'm such a fan of Scorsese's. I can't give it more than seven stars (and that's generous) because it just isn't tight enough. It's a rambling, episodic mess
of a film that would have benefited from having 20 to 30 minutes trimmed out
of it. The performances are all top-notch. Joe Pesci is the obvious
nod -- he got the most flamboyant character. But Liotta, De Niro, Bracco, and
Sorvino all soar here as well. The shot-structure and scene-to-scene direction
are also both excellent. I expect that from Scorsese. He's one of the best
directors of the last half-century. But I think he got trapped by his own
fascination with his source material. Because the film plays like a series of
vignettes that Henry Hill is telling us as we all sit on bar-stools in some
shabby tavern. Not bad by any means. And each nugget is interesting in its
own right. But more judicious editing would have made for an even better film. 5 December 2022.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

Masterpiece,"Martin Scorsese's ""Goodfellas,"" released in 1990, stands as a seminal work in the crime genre, a film that captures the allure and the depravity of mob life in America with remarkable finesse. Adapted from Nicholas Pileggi's non-fiction book ""Wiseguy,"" the film revolves around Henry Hill, played masterfully by Ray Liotta, and his life inside the mob. With a strong supporting cast that includes Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, the film offers an intimate look at the complexities and contradictions of a criminal lifestyle.The story unfolds in a series of vignettes that span several decades, allowing viewers to see the different phases of mob life, from the initial allure to the inevitable downfall. Henry Hill's narrative voice serves as our guide through this labyrinthine world, drawing us into the intricacies of a life built on loyalty, violence, and material excess. The script is sharp, with dialogue that crackles and burns into the viewer's memory. Lines like ""As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster,"" capture the allure and mystique of the criminal underworld, setting the tone for the journey we're about to undertake.The film's pacing is impeccable, and it knows when to speed up and when to give the audience a moment to breathe. The infamous ""Copacabana shot,"" a single-take Steadicam sequence that follows Henry and Karen through the back entrance of a nightclub, serves as a microcosm of the film's technical brilliance. It's not just showing off; it's enveloping the viewer in the seductive charm of mob life. Likewise, the soundtrack, featuring hits from the '50s to the '70s, acts as an aural time capsule and an emotional underpinning for the narrative.Joe Pesci's portrayal of Tommy DeVito steals the show, earning him an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Tommy is charming yet psychopathic, a man whose violent tendencies are both a product and a necessity of the world he inhabits. Robert De Niro's performance as Jimmy Conway is more understated but equally complex, a man who sees crime as a business and relationships as transactional.However, the film is not without its criticisms. Some viewers might find the relentless violence and profanity off-putting, arguing that they serve to glorify a life of crime. There's also an underrepresentation of female characters, with Lorraine Bracco's Karen being the notable exception. Though her role provides a glimpse into the lives affected indirectly by the mob, she remains more of a supporting figure in Henry's story rather than a fully realized character on her own.What ""Goodfellas"" achieves most effectively is a sense of ambivalence towards its subjects. It neither glorifies nor vilifies the mob but rather presents it as a complex social institution with its own codes and ethics. This ambivalence is what makes ""Goodfellas"" a standout - a film that lets its characters revel in their lives without exempting them from the consequences of their choices.In summary, ""Goodfellas"" remains a cinematic masterpiece, not just as a crime film but as an exploration of the American dream gone awry. Through its captivating storytelling, stellar performances, and meticulous attention to detail, the movie offers an unflinching look into a life of crime, complete with all its temptations and pitfalls. It's a film that continues to be relevant, dissected, and admired over three decades after its release, and its legacy is well-deserved.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Best mafia movie,"One of the best Mafia movies I've ever seen. A classic that all should watch at least once. Highly recommended ! Of course Joe Perci is an actor. Just playing roles.

A Mob Movie for the Ages,"This ballad of New York City gangsters began with a bang. The opening scene portrays a bloodied, blinded victim tied up in the trunk of a car. My first thought was ""how are they going to top this?"" Nonetheless, Martin Scorsese and the entire production crew continued to leave the audience in shock and awe. The fact that this movie is based off of horrifically true events makes it that much more unnerving and thus entertaining. The film dives deep into the nooks and crannies of mafia culture, sparing no harsh details, regardless of the brutality. Many people that have seen this film have complained about ""lazy screen writing"" due to the vast usage of profanity, however I have come to the conclusion that the f-bombs added an element of truth to it. What many don't understand, is that this film was created to open eyes and unveil the ugly face of mafia and crime in early 60's America, and during that time, in the midst of their fugitive culture, this is the type of language that gangsters and hustlers would have and do use. For that reason, it makes sense to include and even glorify the sailor's mouths of the characters. Another thing that many conservative audiences did not enjoy was the frequent scenes of drug/alcohol abuse throughout the film. Again I repeat: this is necessary to include when creating a purposeful movie about the mob. Furthermore, this is based primarily off the life of the main character, Henry Hill, who did experience the events in the film truthfully. As hard as it is for some of us to fathom, ignorance in the face of the body, in essence substance abuse, is very common in the subcultures of our country, the Mafia being the most notorious of these subcultures. Overall, the film was very true to life, entertaining, and well made. Camera work was prestigious, using 28mm lenses to create a retro aura, whilst the images staying true to the work and very polished and clean. The acting was beyond expectation. Ray Liotta as Henry Hill was a very good choice, pinning the role as if he were actually Hill, not to mention DeNiro and Pesci's performances as bloodthirsty mob-men, which were certainly Oscar worthy. Final decision: 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
The only gangster movie you ever need to see,"20 Years after Joe Pesci asked, ""Do I amuse you?"" it's still hard not to be terrified by the selfish cruelty. The true story of mob rat Henry Hill seduces us with raw honesty and a charming ""matter of fact monologue"" by Ray Liotta. Is lying to yourself a white lie when it keeps you focused on the crime at hand? When Lorraine Bracco joins in and mirrors the storytelling monologue from the viewpoint of an outsider being charmed into the family, and suddenly the gangster genre is taken to new levels. Robert De Niro is masterful as Jimmy Conway spiraling out of control. Martin Scorcese's vision comes across through the inner workings of the Copacana to using the beautiful finality of the coda of ""Layla"", as the Lufthansa heist crew are innocently discovered all over the place. And these guys are Goodfellas? That's the hypocrisy played out.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
A film which should be put on a pedestal above the rest,"Everyone in their right mind knows that Martin Scorsese is one of the greatest directors of all time and that his depiction of 'gangster' movies is second to none. This comes from his upbringing which he so brilliantly translates onto the screen. No one can translate the passion and emotion like Scorsese can from his past experiences onto the screen. Although Scorsese leaves his footprints in every movie he makes, his most pertinent footprints are left in the films Mean Streets(1973) and Goodfellas(1990). Scorsese grew up in ItalianAmerican New York. That being said, he is a master at conveying the lies, deception, and greed which occurs in regular 'gangster' life. Goodfellas mainly focuses in on the life of Henry Hill portrayed by Ray Liotta. It follows him from a young boy, through his dealings with the mob, his drug addiction and jail time, and to his eventual court case and permanent stay in the witness protection program. Goodfellas is full of sheer drama, a taste of guns knives, and a whole lot of raw gangster lifestyle beautifully portrayed by Liotta, Joe Pesci, and Robert De Niro. These three, combined with Scorsese seemingly give the movie its color. In terms of gangster films, nothing can compare with the realistic atmosphere which Scorsese continues to create time and time again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"

The story is strong; the characters are memorable. The acting is superb -- Pesci steals the show, but DeNiro and ""protaginist"" Liotta are subtly outstanding.""Goodfellas"" keeps a strong pace and will not leave you bored. If you are at all intrigued by organized crime, this glamorous view of mafia life will keep you all the more entertained. The violence is not too intentionally gory (see ""Scarface"" or ""Reservoir Dogs"" if you are looking for senseless death). Instead, it is tasteful and powerful.I will point out the movie's only real shortcoming: a bit too much narration. Obviously, the narration is important for those of us that understand mob life, but it can be tedious at times.Overall, an essential drama about organized crime that has interesting themes and tones. I say a MUST SEE, 8.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
One of the best of its genre,"It just so happens I watched The Irishman right before watching this movie, as both films are similar in a way; an adaptation of a book about a story of a real life gangster, and you can see the tons of elements of this movie that Martin Scorsese brought to the Irishman. Both are great in their own way but I prefer this one as it's shorter and more to the point.This film is a biopic of Henry Hill, a young man from New York's poorest neighborhood. We see him and his two friends, Jimmy and Tommy, lookout for ways to climb a career ladder as members of the Italian mafia.Goodfellas shows how straight-up scary it is to be a 'wiseguy', and it doesn't hold back when it comes to portrayal of violence in modern mob life. the emphasis isn't on plot, which is a series of disconnected events and skips back and forth; it's on one mobster's experience. Through voice-over narration, we see thirty years of that life through Henry's eyes, and we get to feel the rush he gets from the power and luxury that the life provides.Greed, violence and power are some of the central topics in the movie. The film also explores such themes as loyalty, class struggle, and immigration. Most of the prominent points in the movie involve money, so people's nature and desires play a crucial role.The performances are exceptional; Robert Deniro played the calm, smiling snake Jimmy Conway convincingly, Joe pesci in his career best performance, played the short-tempered, murderous lunatic Tommy Devito, Ray Liotta as Henry Hill in the lead role did a great job, and I think deserved way more recognition for his performance but poor him, how could he? since he was overshadowed by the likes of Deniro and Pesci. Lorraine Bracco performance as Karen hill is also memorable.The soundtrack is absolutely brilliant, it's a huge collection of more than 40 songs starting from 1950s through the 1970s. From the first song by Tony Bennett to the last song by Sid Vicious, the music adds more impact, pace and characterization to the film. The music is there clearly and when it comes to really important moments, It really boost up the heart of audience and thoroughly immersed with the characters that a parallel is drawn through the lives of the musicians and characters in the movie. The thoroughness of the expertise and intensity in the choice of the songs creates such a spiritual and omniscient voice in the soundtrack.The cinematography is great; Cinematographer Michael Ballhaus, along with Martin Scorsese utilized great steady cam work, with intelligent usage of freeze frames, to capture important moments in Henry's life like the scene where Henry is running away after torching some cars, and after he took a beating from his father. He also used these great, eye-level seeking shots, displaying the amazing scenery and characters emotions. The lighting is also well-done, as it isn't afraid to use darkness.All in all, Goodfellas is directed, written and acted well. Sometimes hilarious and raunchy and sometimes very raw and violent, with themes that are relevant and that are resonant in today's society.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
Just the Negatives,"I feel like I don't have the capability to explain the good parts in this movie so I just want to explain the parts I found weak compared to the other parts. First of all Joe Pesci was 10/10 in this movie but for me Liotta was kinda a 6/10. It needed a better actor for such a main actor. The movie was so great that, Liotta's good acting seemed not enough, I wanted something as Pesci. The other thing I didn't like was the whole narrative. Scorsese uses this trick a lot and I would rather watch and understand the story rather than listen to a story like it is an E-Book. I found that very weak. Other than that everything was 11/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
amazing movie,"I thought this was an amazing movie and portrayal of the events that happened in the life of Henry Hill. The gangsters were truly brought to life and showed the brutality of the way things were back then. Joe Pesci really knew how to put the fear of God into others in his role as Tommy, if the real-life Tommy was anything like that I don't think I would want to meet him. I will admit that the part where I felt a little sympathy for Tommy was during the portion where one of the older gang members got out of jail and was at the bar party and ridiculed Tommy in front of everybody. Although, I did feel that Tommy went too far in his actions of murdering the man.

The Meaning Of The Mob,"The more time passes, the better ""GoodFellas"" looks.A decades-long examination of the Mafia lifestyle as seen through the eyes of minor Brooklyn hoodlum Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), whose secret to survival involves keeping quiet, ""GoodFellas"" puts you in the back seat watching with Henry as his pals steal, rob, burn, and kill each other off. One thing about living the good life is that it's never good enough. As Henry and wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco) partake more in the money, they also become more exposed to the danger.That's really the core of the story, though it's probable if you haven't seen ""GoodFellas"" you think more of it as the one where Henry's temperamental friend Tommy (Joe Pesci) wants to know why you find him so amusing.""GoodFellas"" is an amusing film, very much so at times, yet like with Tommy there's always a barb that comes with the laughter, and makes for a deeper overall experience. Director Martin Scorsese and co-screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi, who wrote the source book ""Wiseguy,"" capture not only the violence but the lifestyle that undergirds and enables the violence, often in finely detailed and witty ways, like when Karen meets the other Mob wives and discovers their penchant for double-knits and beating their sons with broom handles.Other organized-crime films either excuse the lifestyle in a relativistic way (""Godfather"") or pump up the volume to an absurd degree (1983's ""Scarface"") in order to sensationalize and glamorize the experience. ""GoodFellas,"" despite its bad-boy reputation, is really on the side of the angels, out to expose the vileness of Mafia living, people who kill each other over nothing and betray each other over nickles and dimes. It's hard to see Scorsese's claims of detesting violence in some of his other films, like ""Gangs Of New York"" and ""Casino,"" because he goes to it so often there, but here you meet the people before you see what happens to them, reducing the pleasure of their demise, while the killings are quick and dirty, not exploited for cheap effect.That and it's so damn entertaining. Scorsese puts on a clinic, one that is still ongoing, with his use of music, tracking shots, and slam-the-door editing, like when we still hear Karen crying from one scene while Henry and his pals walk through a door to start the next. Even when you watch this film again (and you sort of have to, there's so much to take in) you aren't bored because there's always some new thing to attract your attention.The character of Jimmy the Gent (Robert De Niro) is a little confusing in the film, especially when he helps crazy Tommy whack a guy he should know better about. The book explains this better, but ""GoodFellas"" is one Scorsese-De Niro collaboration in which De Niro is often not the most important person on screen when he is on screen. He's good, but Liotta is classic in the central role, a performance for the ages in fact, while Pesci made for a deserved Oscar recipient with the way he inhabits Tommy the walking Id and delivers ""GoodFellas"" message of how the good life isn't all that good, that there's always something rotten beneath the surface that will reach up and grab you at the wrong time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime, Drama"
