An amazing film,"I refused to see Jerry Maguire for several years, assuming it was a cheap movie about money, sports and sex. When i finally watched it on TV, i was blown away. This movie is about hope, redemption, love, and finding out the meaning of life. Tom Cruise does a spectacular job playing someone with nothing to loose, and Cuba Gooding's performance brought tears to my eyes. Renee Zellweger fits perfectly by having great chemistry with Jerry, and by having a normal, plain look. This film works because it's so real and easily plausible; its a witty, romantic drama more than a romantic comedy that proves its never too late to start over or take a risk.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Good script, good acting equals good film.","""Jerry Maguire"" has to rate as one of the most quotable movies of the last decade and a half. It's given us the lines ""Show me the money"", ""Help me, Help you"", ""You had me at hello"" and ""You complete me"". And it's that last line, that really describe this movie. It's really about the growth of an individual. We see Jerry Maguire the character, grow from just an agent to becoming much more, it's not an easy trip but for the most part it's an entertaining one.Jerry Maguire is a top sport agent. He has a decent amount of big names as client and he's engage to a beautiful woman. Then one day while visiting one of his client in the hospital, the client's young son confronted him after he gives the client a shallow encouragement. The confrontation stick in his mind and would even get him to write a ""mission statement"" for the company. The ""mission statement"" basically lays out a plan that the agents give their clients more personal attention. Unfortunately his boss doesn't like it.The movie gives us a look at the world of the sports agents. Who are they that gets a cut of an athlete's earning and do they really deserve it? In the beginning they're just there to negotiate the numbers and get the athletes as much exposure. In the end, Jerry has become more than a guy who makes deal for an athlete. It also gives us a look at some clients they're more demanding than the agents are prepared to handle. But if handled right they will prove to be worth the trouble.Jerry Maguire is played by Tom Cruise, and he gives one of his best performance. I think it's every bit the equal of Cuba Gooding Jr's. Oscar winning performance. Both men were on top of their game playing off each other. It's sad that his erratic behavior of late has caused harmed to his career because Tom Cruise is a very good actor. So too is Mr. Gooding and Renee Zellwegger, who plays an office worker in Tom Cruise's office and who joined him as he tries to put forth his ""mission statement"" into practice.All in all, I think it's a good movie with a very observant script, complimented by great acting.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Only Cameron Crowe can make a movie like this,"I just finished watching this movie for the third time and I still love this movie as much as I did after the first time I watched it. Maybe even more! As I already said in the title of my review, only Cameron Crowe can make this kind of movies. Movies about life the way it is and life the way it should be. What I like the most about Crowe's work, is that everything is real. The characters, their emotions, the story, The whole is absolutely amazing.Tom Cruise gave an excellent performance as the sports agent with a heart. Someone for who money isn't the most important thing. It's all about the relationship between the sports agent and his client. What's so great about ""Jerry Maguire"", is the fact that the movie isn't about who Jerry Maguire really is, it's about who he wants to be. I loved Cuba Gooding Jr. By far his greatest role ever. Let's not forget Renée Zellweger and her cute son, amazingly performed by the young Jonathan Lipnicki. Both where very good. Perfect casting for Zellweger.I read in the trivia that the title role was written for Tom Hanks. Don't get me wrong, Tom Hanks is an excellent actor, but to play an ambitious and arrogant sports manager (what Jerry Maguire was at the beginning of the movie), you need to have Tom Cruise's face. He was just perfect for the role. I can't think of anybody who could have done this as good as he did.So my conclusion for Jerry Maguire: If you haven't seen it, you should definitely see it. If you have seen it, I hope you can agree with me. This movie is wonderful, as where are used from Cameron Crowe-movies.9/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"It used to be a better meal, now it's a better life","I've almost always loved Crowe's style of storytelling and never tire of rewatching 'Almost Famous' and 'Jerry McGuire' (which I consider his best). Even though his more recent 'Elizabethtown' didn't match up the standards of those two films, that too had its wonderful moments (and it was better than 'Vanilla Sky', Crowe shouldn't have attempted remakes). Like most of his films, 'Jerry McGuire' has soul. Crowe's eloquent screenplay is rich in humour, drama and lots of energy. It features some of the finest dialogues and one-liners like 'You had me at hello', 'Don't cry at the beginning of a date, cry at the end like I do'... and the actors deliver them marvelously. Another fascinating aspect is the brilliant characters. Each and every one of them, no matter how long the screen time, has something that contributes. Thus, next to an engaging drama and a magnificent comedy it is a fine character study.'Jerry McGuire' may also be one of Cruise's career best movies. I'm surprised to hear that the part was originally written for Tom Hanks. Hanks is a fine actor but I can't imagine him as McGuire as I doubt whether he has the right combination of energy and pathos that are required to be McGuire. I can't imagine anyone but Tom who fits the part. The same can be said of Renee Zellweger and Cuba Godding Jr as I don't see how a Winona Ryder, Cameron Diaz or Mira Sorvino and a Jamie Foxx (all good actresses) could respectively bring out the sweetness, vulnerability and charisma of Dorothy Boyd or the energy, humour, liveliness, enthusiasm and devotion (towards family) of Rod Tidwell. One wonders why Zellweger was overlooked as her presence too is crucial to the film.In addition, the film has a splendid supporting cast that include a sublime and laugh-out-loud Bonnie Hunt, a bitchy gorgeous Kelly Preston, a sprightly Regina King and an unforgettably lovable Jonathan Lipnicki (one of the few child actors who's cute but not in the way that gets on your nerves)'. Child actors are very hard to direct but Lipnicki's performance comes across as very natural and he acts like a real child instead of those irritating oh-look-I'm-so-cute child models.The soundtrack too deserves mention as it features some amazing numbers. One of the so many memorable scenes is when McGuire is driving in his car and he listens to the radio, switching channels and singing along. Then there's also the incredibly romantic 'Secret Garden' by Bruce Springsteen among other great familiar tracks by the Beatles, Rolling Stone, Marvin Gaye, Kurt Cobain etc. On the more technical side, the wild and smooth cinematography, slick editing and effective sound are superbly put together. The visuals are very impressive.The last time I had watched 'Jerry McGuire' was about 10 years ago and I vividly remember saying 'wow!' when the end credits started to roll that my sibling wondered what the hell was going on. I feel the same about it after having rewatched it recently. Well, actually I like it more because I noticed more things that I overlooked before and understand and like the characters more. McGuire's transformation from the money-obsessed agent to the caring agent and then to the caring human being (in the form of a father and a husband), a change that wouldn't have happened if it weren't for the caring people in his life, is one remarkable story.",,Anonymous,Romance
"It was a big deal in '96, but Jerry's not a character I can get behind","""Jerry Maguire"", the awkward sports/romcom mashup that sometimes works. Sometimes.I feel like Tom Cruise fits best here as a sports agent, his image aligning well with the hyper schmoozing salesman, but not as the romantic leading man. I say this as a recent convert, mostly due to his later work (you compare this to something like ""Edge of Tomorrow"" or ""Maverick"", they're two different actors).Renée Zellweger on the other hand, she brings the luminescence. She's amazing and steals every one of her scenes. It's completely fair to say she does the heavy lifting on the romance side of things. Cuba Gooding Jr took a while but he grew on me.What I didn't see coming was the cute kid, and that's who kept me going through the (inexcusably long) movie til the end. Jonathan Lipnicki is incredibly charming, but his character really got to me. When he was happy, I was happy. When he was heartbroken, I was shattered, and really wanted to hit Jerry Maguire in the face. But every scene had me hoping the kid would show up again, and if there's an MVP (c'mon, it's a sports movie) it's totally him.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Reminds Me Why I Fell In Love With Movies 💯,"Many moving parts rhythmically sync together in Cameron Crowe's 'Jerry Maguire' - one of the best films of the 1990s. Hard to believe it's been 25 years, and just saw Maguire for maybe 20th time, so long overdue are my comments.The influence and imprint on this film by brilliant filmmaker/TV series creator/producer James Brooks is apparent in how Cameron directed this film - it was an interesting mentoring brain-share between Cameron and Jim during pre-production that set the direction for Jerry Maguire.The preparation for filming included: a side trip to Billy Wilder's house by Cameron and Tom Cruise in an attempt to recruit the elder legend for a key Day-Player bit part in the film (didn't work); the introduction of then little-known Renee Zellweger by casting director legend Gail Levin (the acting rapport between Renee and Tom during her audition was instant and never wavered); Cuba Gooding's infectious enthusiasm that won him his role over more famous names, and an Oscar in the Spring for Supporting Actor; and Tom Hanks' early consideration for the Lead that as it turns out was fortunate to have too many scheduling conflicts (much of the dialogue in JM was written for Hanks). Interesting background stories are common to Cameron Crowe film production.But the engine that propels this film are the timeless ideals of pursuit of meaning and happiness in one's life, the power of overcoming adversity - ""going for it"" and stretching for the brass ring, finding true love and commitment to it, and developing key friendships that have a lifetime impact in one's life.One is initially inserted into this story during Jerry's rapid ascent towards the pinnacle of career success as a sports agent, followed by an overnight ethics crisis ""free falling"" to the edge of a career-abyss. This perfect storm of dramatic conflict ties each of the main characters together, and we are immersed and hooked for the rest of the film.The memorable/quotable dialogue in 'Jerry Maguire' is iconic (""show me the money"", ""you complete me"", ""you had me at hello"", etc.), delivered by actors that rose to the occasion, each putting forth inspired performances.Cameron has a way of extracting an actors' genuine emotional connection to their character that few directors achieve. This ability can be found in every Cameron Crowe film from 'Say Anything' (1989) forward.Cameron's music-sync of iconic songs in the film are inspired and perfect (as one would expect), surpassed in his films only by those tracks used in his semi-autobiographical 'Almost Famous' (Cameron's greatest film to date, and on my IMDb Top 10 Greatest Comedy Films list).'Jerry Maguire' is timeless and memorable, and a reminder for me why I fell in love with movies (and music) at a very young age - a lifetime gift that gets re-stoked by films like this one.An easy decision to rate Jerry Maguire a 10 as one of film's Top 100 💯 Greatest Movies.👍👍",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"You Lost Me with ""You Had Me at Hello""","Fairly entertaining sports film that works best when it's focused on Tom Cruise's at-loose-ends agent and his client, played by Cuba Gooding, Jr. But the film crashes and burns when it becomes about the love story between Cruise and Renee Zellweger's character. Writer/director Cameron Crowe has proved time and again that he can't write female characters worth a damn, mostly because he treats them the way adolescent boys treat women when they ""discover"" them for the first time.This film goes down smoothly enough, but it's too long and Crowe's writing style is too self-consciously cutesy for my taste (""Show me the money!"" ""You had me at hello""). This wasn't even close to being one of the best films of 1996, its Best Picture Academy Award nomination notwithstanding.Grade: B-",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Agent Seeks Something Higher -- Possibly Cruise's Best Film,"At the 1997 Academy Awards, host Billy Crystal referred to the characters played by the five Best Actor nominees (of which Tom Cruise was one) as being ""a burned guy, a mentally-challenged guy, a mentally-abused guy, a paralyzed guy, and an agent. And four out of the five are treatable."" Of course Crystal was jokingly referring to the Agent as being beyond help. Among the figures of sports and entertainment, agents are often regarded as the necessary evil of the industry often with reputations as being the sleaziest of VIP's, just-above used car salesmen. Their antics which require a high-level of tough negotiations are sometimes seen as money-gouging and materialistic. In the film ""Jerry Maguire"", Tom Cruise decides to wear the shoes of a sports agent and walk around in them for just over two hours.""Who am I, and what am I doing?"" Jerry Maguire asks when he realizes his sports agency, SMI, tries to cover up the darker aspects of professional sports. His answer is inspiring, transcendent, and detrimental. He mistakenly writes down his inspired thoughts and submits them to his colleagues for suggesting the agency concentrate better on fewer clients. For his inspiration, he loses his place at his agency and many of his highest-paying clients to his rival Bob Sugar. Subsequently, he also loses his attractive but shallow fiancé. Maguire is forced to try and live his dream of being more caring and receptive towards the needs of his clients rather than just being there to get a slice of his athlete/clients' multi-million-dollar paychecks. In a particularly poignant sequence, he retains his client Frank ""Cush"" Cushman who is a leading contender in the NFL draft through a handshake with his father, played by Beau Bridges. However, on draft day, he learns through an unexpected phone call that his rival Bob Sugar, through deception, convinced Cushman to sign with him instead. Now, Maguire has retained only Tidwell, and he must create his new agency from the ground up with only a single client as his starting point.So the question asked of the movie is: Can a sports agent find a more meaningful, possibly spiritual, life and still acquire the high-paying clientèle? And maybe even more to the point, can an agent make a difference beyond just being a high-powered money negotiator? ""Jerry Maguire"" is a thoroughly entertaining riches-to-rags-to-transcendence story of a fantasy sports agent trying to find a deeper purpose to an otherwise materialistic existence.The film works at almost all levels, particularly because of the dynamism of Tom Cruise and Cuba Gooding Jr. in an Academy Award-winning performance, playing the only client willing to stay with Maguire. Part of the story is Maguire's journey from the purely material to a deeper and more-satisfying existence. Rod Tidwell (Gooding), wide receiver for the Cardinals, is a strange opposite to Cruise but has a similar problem. Tidwell is a devoted father and husband, emotionally involved with his family but does not quite give that same heart on the football field. The story becomes about both characters finding something deeper in their place in the world, Gooding giving what he gives to his family to his team, and Cruise giving to his clients and co-worker/lover Dorothy Boyd his love and attention. Renee Zellweger plays Dorothy Boyd in a passionate and sensitive performance that will definitely bring tears. Zellweger's son becomes an important character and also an inspiration to Cruise to find the deeper and more sensitive part of himself.In the materialistic world of late 20th-century America, ""Jerry Maguire"" is a breath of fresh air. A rare story produced by the money-obsessed film studios about the dangers of losing oneself for the sake of self-promotion and monetary gain. An interesting statistic has emerged of late regarding a high number of American businessmen on their deathbeds who begin regretting the direction and purpose of their lives. ""Jerry Maguire"" offers an alternative, although probably few in his position would find the wisdom to change course. But since you can't take it with you, life is about what you leave behind.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Cruise steals the show in this feel-good Hollywood romcom,"A huge hit for all involved upon release in 1996 (where does 20 years go?), for some reason I've never shown Jerry Maguire ""my money"" and watched it in its entirety, despite it being the film that spawned an endless count of imitators trying to redo instantly classic scenes or launched the careers of Renee Zellweger and the Oscar winning Cuba Gooding Jr.Before he went on to make the other instantly recognisable and well-regarded Almost Famous, director Cameron Crowe combined his skills as a writer and a feel-good director to give us this insight into sports agent with heart Jerry Maguire and his fight against the odds to keep his head above water but while the film masquerades under this disguise Crowe's film is quite simply a Hollywood romance between Tom Cruise's Maguire and Zellweger's caring single mom Dorothy Boyd, whose young child Ray (played by Stuart Little's very own brother Jonathan Lipnicki) just about steals the show.Lathered in Hollywood schmaltz and filled with a loud American bravado thanks to Cruise and Gooding Jr's turns, it's hard to know how Crowe's film would be received had it been released in today's climate but as with many 90's rom-coms you go in expecting things to be more fanciful and over the top than we've come to expect from the modern age's more realistic ventures and it would take a viewer with a heart of stone to walk away from watching this uplifting tale not feeling some of those good vibrations that Crowe has largely failed to recapture in his career since (just look at Aloha).Finding himself completely entangled in this feel good romance is it's star Tom Cruise who delivers arguably one of his most likable and complete turns as the driven yet always appealing Maguire.If there was ever questions as to why Cruise was and still is one of the world's most bankable and relatable on screen persona's, it's likely that Jerry Maguire would answer them in one clean sweep.Showcasing an energy, likability and delivery of important scenes that very few actors could dare to muster up, Cruise is without a doubt the quintessential Maguire, that person than can make anyone drink their Kool-Aid and in almost every scene of a movie that runs over 2 hours, Maguire ends up giving Cruise one of his most rounded and memorable acting gigs which is no small feat in a career filled to the brim with lasting classics.Not everything works within the film however. Some scenes fall flat and Gooding Jr's Oscar winning turn is hard to support when watched under current conditions, all yelling and hyperactivity, it's not exactly the type of performance that you'd call the ""year's best"" although those feel good vibes and the films overall success no doubt influenced many who were under the spell of Crowe and his audience appeasing venture.A fun, smile inducing film that's influence can't be underestimated, Jerry Maguire is over the top and filled with Hollywoodized moments, plus it's fair share of over the top scenarios and performance but with Crowe in the best form of his career as a filmmaker and Cruise on peak likability mode, Jerry Maguire is a film worthy of its reputation even if it's not quite the classic some would label it to be and absolutely a product of its time.3 ½ memo's out of 5",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Successful multi genre,"This movie is a comedy, drama, romance, sports movie, and a money movie (e.g. Wall Street, where the main character is trying to make a lot of money). The problem such a movie faces is maintaining a consistent tone. Remember Prizzi's Honor? JM solves that problem by using restraint. It doesn't go over the top, although its characters sometimes do. It has funny moments, but it's not Animal House or American Pie. It's a drama, but it keeps the stakes low. This isn't Armageddon: they aren't trying to save the world. There are no life or death decisions. The romantic stakes aren't that high either: Renee Zellweger loves Tom Cruise, but she's been in love before and if this doesn't work out, she will be again. The only really high stakes are the money. By keeping the stakes low, JM let's us watch it with a bit of detachment.This is more of a drama than a comedy. A good test is whether the characters change. Here, Tom Cruise starts off completely cynical, abruptly changes to ridiculously idealistic, then spends the rest of the movie finding the right balance. Renee Zellweger starts by loving Tom Cruise from afar, then gets him, then has to work out her ambiguous feelings.JM is fun to watch. The characters, though flawed, are sympathetic. We enjoy watching them succeed, fail (sometimes in funny ways), and try to discover what they really care about. It's complicated, thoughtful, and surprisingly subtle.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Better than most rom-coms,"Funny how some very popular and acclaimed movies can become less thought of as time goes by. ""Show me the money"", You had me at hello"" and especially ""You complete me"" were all such effective lines upon its initial release and now they are mostly used in jokes. However, these were very effective lines at the time and its still a good, though a bit manipulative, movie with Cruise giving one of his better performances and looking great. This put Renee Zellweger on the map and she is indeed quite touching and very good in this and Cuba Gooding Jr is a fun presence and owes an Oscar win to those four words ""Show me the money."" When one looks at the nominees that year in his category and sees the astonishing presence of Edward Norton's film debut in Primal Fear it shows us yet another of Oscar's many questionable choices. Anyway, despite the nitpicking, this sports/love story movie is an entertaining and slickly made film. There are a lot of appealing supporting actors in this as well. Its hard not to like, even if you try.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
High-Energy Entertainment,"By definition, and depending upon who you're talking to, `Success' can be measured in a number of different ways.  It's winning the competition, celebrating a Golden Wedding Anniversary or, to many, just making the most money.  The first two are absolutes; you win and you make it to number 50. No gray areas.  If you're not dead, you're alive; you're either pregnant or you're not.  But in regards to that third item on the list, what are the parameters by which you measure that particular success?  Are there lines across which you will not step to make that extra buck?  Or do you do whatever it takes-- including selling your soul and sacrificing your very identity-- to make as much of the green as you can.  Is that success?  Or is that selling out.  Can there, in fact, be true success when ethics and integrity are absent?  It's the territory writer/director Cameron Crowe explores in `Jerry Maguire,' the hit 1996 film that landed him an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay, a Best Actor nomination for star Tom Cruise, and captured the award for Best Supporting Actor for Cuba Gooding Jr.Jerry Maguire (Cruise) is a high-powered sports agent for a huge agency, handling a portfolio filled with high profile sports figures.  And the name of Jerry's game is money; he gets the big bucks for those he represents, he keeps them in the limelight and in the end pulls down some mighty big bucks for himself and the firm.  But at what price?  Who is Jerry Maguire, really? Has he played the chameleon for so long as a means to an end that even he doesn't know who he is anymore?  Does he even consider it?  If he stopped to think about it, the answer would be a resounding `No.'  But then something happens.  One night, he wakes up and happens to look at himself in the mirror, and for whatever reason, it suddenly dawns on him what a selfish, soulless, empty life he is leading.  So in the wake of this epiphany, he seizes the moment, sits down at his keyboard and hammers out a `mission/morality statement,' in which he reorganizes his entire approach to his career, including reestablishing parameters and setting new priorities making conscience, ethics and integrity his paramount concerns.  And while still riding the high of his nocturnal enlightenment, he goes to his office, makes copies of his statement and distributes it to the mailboxes of everyone from his boss on down.  Then he goes home and goes to bed.In the cold light of morning, however, he realizes what he's done and races to his office to avert disaster.  Too late.  He enters the room to a hail of praise and appreciation from his peers, but his boss is less enthusiastic. It's no surprise to Jerry, then, when the big `M' his superiors are interested in turns out to be `Money' and not `Morality,' as in `Money talks, Jerry walks.'  And just like that he's out the door.  But before he leaves, he vows to make it on his own.  He's up, he's positive, he has his statement-- and he doesn't have a clue what to do next.  What he does know is that the adventure of a lifetime is awaiting.  And the world is about to meet the `real' Jerry Maguire.Cameron Crowe made his debut as a writer/director with `Say Anything' in 1989, in which he first exhibited that keen insight into the human condition that has been one of the trademarks of his success as a filmmaker.  In `Jerry Maguire' he demonstrates again that acute sense of knowing what makes people tick, and leaves no doubt that he knows how to convey it to his audience.  Crowe's story, as well as the presentation, is original and imaginative, and he fills it with real characters involved in very real situations.  And it's the characters that really sell it, because these are three-dimensional people, not just cardboard cut-outs, and moreover, Cameron knows how to get the best out of his actors to really bring them to life.Tom Cruise was the perfect choice to play Jerry; he has the look, the energy and the talent to get inside this guy's skin and make him tick, and he successfully channels his natural exuberance into his character, tempering his performance just enough to make it really work.  An Oscar nomination does not come cheaply, and Cruise certainly deserved the one he received for his work here.Cuba Gooding Jr.'s performance is deserving of the acclaim he received for it, as well.  As Rod Tidwell, the pro football player/client who sticks by Jerry and insists that he `Show me the money!' Gooding equals, if not surpasses Cruise's level of enthusiasm with a vibrant and rich portrayal that makes Rod one of his most memorable characters.  Like Cruise, Gooding is perfectly cast and points up, again, what an acute sense Cameron has for who and what will work to bring his story so convincingly to the screen.Not to be outdone by her co-stars, Renee Zellweger gives an endearing performance as the vulnerable but steadfast, single mom, Dorothy Boyd. She's such a `giving' actor, and she endows Dorothy with a gentle, caring manner that expresses her deepest thoughts and feelings so well.  Her reaction, in the scene in which Jerry tells Dorothy-- with his back turned to her-- that he has broken up with his fiancee, Avery (Kelly Preston), is priceless, and alone makes this film worth watching (repeatedly).  Her work here is every bit as Oscar worthy as Cruise and Gooding's, and it's hard to understand why she was overlooked, as she is such a vital presence in this film.  9/10.The supporting cast includes Jerry O'Connell (Frank), Jay Mohr (Bob Sugar), Bonnie Hunt (terrific in her role of Laurel Boyd, Dorothy's sister), Regina King (Marcee) and Jonathan Lipnicki, unforgettable as Dorothy's precocious son, Ray.  A triumph for Cameron Crowe, this movie is, indeed, magic.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Touchy-Feely But Fun,"The best thing in the DVD of ""Jerry Maguire"" is not even the movie itself. It's the complete text of the title character's controversial ""Mission Statement"", invested by writer-director Cameron Crowe with the same passion, humor, and character-consciousness that drove his Rolling Stone profiles and script for ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High"".The movie is pretty good, too.Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) is a high-flying agent about to sign the most-prized NFL recruit in the country when a crisis of conscience forces him to write and distribute the aforementioned mission statement. Summararily canned by his agency, he's forced to scramble to save his career, with the help of his assistant Dorothy (Renée Zellweger) and their one client, head-case wideout Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr.)With this movie, it becomes clear that Cameron Crowe took the ball from John Hughes and ran with it. The kind of films Hughes used to make, of weepy love scenes and whipsmart wisecracks set against an esoteric pop score, are the kind of films Crowe makes, only with adults. In that way, ""Jerry Maguire"" satisfies.What grates about this movie, and more with other Crowe films like ""Almost Famous"", is the way people speak to each other in the form of taglines rather than actual human speech. ""Just jump right into my nightmare, the water's warm!"" ""I'm her disapproving sister."" ""I've had three lovers in four years, and all of them ran a distant second to a good book and a warm bath."" ""That's more than a dress. That is an Audrey Hepburn movie."" ""Help me help you!""At least Crowe has the good sense of turning the last line into a running joke. He also is helped, unlike ""Almost Famous"", with the kind of top-notch cast that can make the most of groaner lines like the almost-infamous ""You complete me"".Cruise is electric on screen, finding the perfect channel for his high-energy persona in the always-on Jerry. Zellweger has a lot of gooey moments, but extracts every ounce of rightness from them to make for a compelling emotional center. Jay Mohr as a rival agent is a wonderfully hateful foil. I can hear him say ""Whatever"" now.Gooding won an acting Oscar for ""Maguire"". Watching him, you understand why. Every time the film seems ready to sag into some touchy-feely moment, his Tidwell is on hand to keep things hopping and real. I can't say I understand why exactly Jerry is constantly questioned about the honesty of his feelings for Dorothy, though it is a major theme of the film's last hour. It's probably why ""Jerry Maguire"" is not a guy film despite the sports setting. When people talk and talk so openly about their feelings, I feel like a nun at a Sam Peckinpah double-feature.This film didn't quite have me at hello, but kept me watching longer than I expected. Give Crowe credit for investing his chick flick with enough humor and energy to keep things from getting too soft. Give Cruise and the rest of the cast praise for strong performances around the horn. And give Dicky Fox a big salute for that fabulous final line. I wish you the same thing he did.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
I still can't warm up to this movie,"I still remember the fuss ""Jerry Maguire"" made when it came out back in '96 and I still remember the first time I saw it and wondered what the big deal was.I respect Cameron Crowe and I think he has good intentions. ""Almost Famous"" is a really, really good chronicle of its era. It had interesting characters who I felt for.""Jerry Maguire"" is cold, distant, and frankly, rather boring. Clocking in way past its limit, it's basically about a loser sports agent Maguire (Tom Cruise) who suddenly finds all his friends and co-workers and even family turning against him as he nears middle-age.The moral is effective - don't let your life be ruled by materialism -- but it's hardly a subtle one. Even Rene Zellweger's character is a huge cliché, being the female love interest who is pure, good-natured, sweet, and represents everything Jerry doesn't have in his life. (His current fiancée in the film is portrayed as a materialistic fraud.) The whole yuppie culture thing is kind of over and ""Jerry Maguire"" would have worked a lot better during the '80s, a decade Crowe seems more comfortable with (he penned ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" after hanging out at a real high school).There's something about this film I've just never been able to warm up to.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Show Me the Money!!!,"""Jerry Maguire"" did something very strange in 1996: it had both critical and commercial success.  This was evident in the fact that the four other Best Picture nominees for the year were all independent productions.  ""Jerry Maguire"" shows the business world of America at its worst, in this case in the sports industry.  When Jerry Maguire, a sports agent, (played by Oscar-nominated Tom Cruise) has a breakthrough one night he realizes that quality is more important than quantity.  Of course he is fired from his job and loses all of his clients except Rod Tidwell (played by Cuba Gooding, Jr. in his Oscar-winning performance).  Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellweger) has left the business with Maguire, agreeing with his views.  However, Maguire struggles with his separation from the sports corporation (losing his fiance and the first pick in the NFL Draft).  However, he survives and learns that living well and loving well are the keys to happiness.  All in all, ""Jerry Maguire"" is classic Hollywood stuff made in the present-day.  Cameron Crowe's script and direction are subtle, but extremely effective.  Tom Cruise delivered his best performance to date.  Renee Zellweger proved to be the find of the year and Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s quotes and scenes he stole were enough to win him the Oscar in a very competitive year in the Best Supporting Actor category.  ""Jerry Maguire"" is not a perfect film. In fact it is flawed in many ways and is not very accurate in some areas.  However, its ability to mix comedy, romance, and drama make it a very entertaining film.  The performances are all excellent.  4.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,Romance
meh...nothing special,"Viewing this film for the first time after being made aware of its several Academy Award nominations, included the reputed Best Picture and Best Director (Cameron Crowe), I was disappointed in how thin this film actually was. But then again, how deep can you go when you're dealing with a romantic comedy? Still, I am yet to understand what all the big hype is about.Tom Cruise delivers an excellent performance as Jerry Maguire, a disgruntled sports agent who loses his job and dignity after having an epiphany about the lack of morals within his basic workplace. He falls for a single mother (Renee Zellweger), simultaneously developing a strong bond with her child and hence embarking on a trip of personal and professional redemption. Cuba Gooding JR is full deserving of his Oscar win as Best Supporting Actor, and Renee Zellweger is solid as always. But that's just about it. A fine cast delivers memorable performances, but what else has this movie got? Crowe's direction is very simple, arguably crossing the line from being ""unpretentious"" to ""boring"". The more technical elements of the picture are also mediocre at best, with simple editing and cinematography contributing to what is ultimately a fairly simple film all round. At the end of the film, you are left feeling that what you viewed was practically the same as any other feel-good romantic comedy that you would watch otherwise. The only difference: a better cast.I must say here that this film's critical recognition by the Academy is one of the most ridiculous things that I've ever heard of. Sure, the film was OK and simple, but to claim that it stood up even as a nominee against the likes of the brilliant ""The English Patient"" and ""Shine"" at the 1997 Academy Awards is an insult to that year and illustrates a deterioration of the medium. This is not to say that Crowe is a bad director or that this was, by any means, a terrible film, but it is by no means deserving of the critical hype that accompanied its theatrical release.All in all, a decent romantic comedy with excellent acting and relatively good editing. But, by all means, nothing special.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Loyalty Without Intimacy,"Cameron Crowe is a genius. Every movie is made to make an audience member feel something. Whether it be laughter, horror, entertainment, or maybe just to be feel good. I simply don't think there is a better director at just making you feel good about life. He must be a tremendously happy person or maybe just too optimistic. No matter, I love his movies. Some would argue that at times his films feel too happy and perhaps unrealistic, to that I say nonsense. I don't mean nonsense as in they are completely invalid, the arguments have a point. I just don't think that always matters. Movies are made to be enjoyed and entertained by, and Crowe almost always comes through there.Jerry Maguire is about a sports agent who is down on his luck after being fired and is left with only one client who still stands by him. But what it's really about is a man with major intimacy issues, who learns how to enjoy life with his heart more than with his wallet, or lack there of. It's pretty much Tom Cruise's quintessential role and one that he very well could have won an academy award for. Cruise not only brings some surprisingly well timed comedy, but a great amount of heart and realism to Jerry. Renee Zellweger also has a career defining performance as Dorothy Boyd, a single mom and a co-worker of Jerry. Crowe has a knack for creating great chemistry between romantic co-stars. Zellweger and Cruise are great together, along with the hilarious son of Boyd, Ray. It's the scenes with all three of them that really touched me in a way that only some films do. Not to mention just how funny the three of them, particularly Ray are in the film. For a film that isn't straight comedy, it made me laugh a whole lot.With Cameron Crowe you also get a great soundtrack and score. Nancy Wilson does an impeccable job scoring at the right times, and the soundtrack choices couldn't be more spot on with the various moments throughout. But it's also Crowe's ability to make an admittingly predictable film feel fresh and re-watchable. He surrounds the wonderful main cast of Cruise, Gooding Jr, and Zellweger, with standouts Regina King and Bonnie Hunt. The writing, music, and direction are all top of the line as Jerry Maguire is simply one of the most enjoyable films I have seen recently. To go along with the fact that being a huge sports fan, it was fascinating to see how the agent business may work. Of course, the film is famous for the endlessly quotable lines, but I feel like the enjoyment of life is what I'm going to take from it, and really how little money can mean in the grand scheme of things.+Cruise at his absolute best+Real romance+Quotable lines+The kid is hilarious+Great sports film+Supporting cast-A little bit predictable9.7/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Feel-good movie,"I just saw Jerry Maguire for the first time a little while ago. It really is a feel-good movie. The cast is first rate. Tom Cruise is good, but supporting players Renee Zellweger, Cuba Gooding Jr., and Regina King really shine! This movie was worthy of more Oscars than it won. Speaking of the Oscars, Gooding's performance in this film was even more exuberant than his acceptance speech! This movie is also loaded with catch phrases ""You complete me."" ""You had me from hello."" and of course ""Show me the money!"" Zellweger and Cruise make an excellent couple, and the viewer really wants them to stay together. Once again, if you need a lift, or just want to really feel good this is the movie for you!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Richly Entertaining Character Study/Romantic Comedy with a first rate cast...,"Tom Cruise had one of his best roles and earned his second Oscar Nomination for Best Actor for his charismatic JERRY MAGUIRE, a richly entertaining comedy drama that is a seamless blend of character study and romantic comedy. Jerry is a driven and ambitious sports agent for an international agency that represents professional athletes in all sports who has a crisis of conscience that motivates him to write a ""mission statement"", which turns out to be more of a defiant manifesto blasting everything that is wrong in his business. he distributes his ""memo"" throughout the office and though it gets faint praise initially, it does end up getting him fired from the agency. We then see Jerry try to continue his business though he only has one client who agrees to stick with him. Director-writer Cameron Crowe (FAST TIMES AT RIDGMONT HIGH; ALMOST FAMOUS)solidified his position as a master cinematic storyteller with this epic story told on an intimate scale. His extremely deft screenplay is sharply delivered by a perfect cast. This role seems tailor-made for Cruise and he makes the most of it. Cuba Gooding Jr. won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his star-making performance as Rod Tidwell, Jerry's most loyal client; Renee Zelwegger was the find of the year as Dorothy Boyd, the secretary from the agency who follows Jerry when he's fired and agrees to work for him and eventually falls for him; Bonnie Hunt scores as Dorothy's sister as does Kelly Preston, in one of her best performances as Jerry's shark of an ex-fiancée. Regina King should have received an Oscar nomination for her solid performance as Tidwell's wife, Marcy; Jay Mohr is quite funny as Bob Sugarman, a rival agent who is battling Jerry to represent another football player (Jerry O'Connell)who is being watched over by his protective dad (Beau Bridges). A rare gem from the 1990's that is not only grandly entertaining, but vividly real...there's nothing false or affected here (though some might find Gooding's Tidwell a little over the top), this film is one of those rare treats that is long, but you hardly feel it. A real treat and a must for Cruise fans.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Good & Bad Of 'Jerry Maguire',"Every time I see a football player act like he's been mortally wounded, and then gets up and continues playing just fine, I think of this movie. Cuba Gooding plays just such a character but Tom Cruise is the star of this movie which did pretty well at the box office. You wouldn't think a film about a sports agent would be this successful.THE GOOD - Generally nice people that you want to root for, especially the kid, ""Ray Boyd,"" played by Jonathan Lipnicki, That was this child's first film and he went on to further fame in the Stuart Little movies and now on television. Cuba Gooding was funny in an exaggerated role of the greedy and show-boating football player. Cruise and Rene Zellweger are big names in the business who usually deliver good performances.THE BAD - Nineties morality (sex right off the bat, and a few other attitudes) and overuse of the f-word. There's not an excessive amount, but way too many f- words for a nice romantic-comedy like this. The film gets a bit soap opera-like at times, and is a little long.OVERALL - Despite the good outweighing the bad, and a generally likable group of characters, I really never had the urge to watch this a second time. Oh, and a postscript: those soccer players in the World Cup that just concluded did Cuba proud with their ""swan dives"" throughout the tournament. One minute they were dead; the next minute, alive and kicking!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Cheesy, contrived, bloated...but I love it","I've seen Jerry Maguire a number of times but it was only on my most recent viewing, at the age of 23, that I came to truly appreciate it. Yes it is all the things I described in the title; but it is also a charming and original film filled with excellent performances, under the control of a man who knows exactly what story he wants to tell. I'm not going to tell everyone it doesn't have its flaws- I can picture Crowe sitting there and smiling to himself after writing ""You had me at hello""- but this is anything but a bad film.Jerry Maguire features an unusual central romance, with Cruise and Zellweger's characters getting together more out of convenience than love (on his part anyway). The relationship is handled with maturity and honesty by all involved. Cruise is terrific throughout the whole film but it is his moments with Zellweger and her character's son where he truly shines. Zellweger herself, oft maligned, also puts in a great performance and in my opinion she has never looked lovelier. But it is the relationship between Cruise's Maguire and Oscar winning Cuba Gooding Jr's Rod Tidwell that is the film's real selling point. It's a relationship built on loyalty, trust and friendship. The film has its twists and turns (and it is too long) but it is the bond between agent and star that keeps the film afloat and ultimately gives it a happy ending.Oscar Note: I don't know what the reaction was like at the time but popular opinion nowadays is that Gooding didn't deserve the Oscar. Bill Macy and Ed Norton are often cited as being robbed, and I can't deny that they were excellent in their respective roles, but I believe Gooding to be more than worthy. You'd be hard pressed to find a more electric, entertaining and effective performance in any film.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Don't Walk Away, Renée","This movie is sweeter than candy. But it is a tad to long to be delicious.It's reflexions on ""real life"" with it's up's and down's is unbearably boring, mostly due to Cruise's soul less effort.What works here is Renée Zellwegger. Her bittersweet performance adds the very welcome drop of reality in this pretending to be realism romantic disappointment.She saves this film from being unwatchable - she and the fine dialogue together with Cuba Gooding Jr.'s perfect supporting role makes this an alright film.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Even if you're not into sports, there's plenty of reasons to cheer for this film","It's amazing to me that so many quotable quotes came from Jerry Maguire. It's a good movie, but I don't quite understand why it made such an impact on pop culture. Some plot points didn't make sense to me and I thought the editing was erratic. Nevertheless, the story of a man barely holding onto his career is interesting. Even if you're not into sports, there's plenty of reasons to cheer for this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Louder than bombs...,"Not really my type of film, but I gave it a go. It's brash, in your face, very loud, a typical modern Hollywood mix of profanity and morality. I had no connection at all with any of the main characters or their situations, I mean I could care less about the contractual expectations of US sports stars and as for the somewhat forced romance of Tom Cruise's maverick sports agent and his acolyte Renee Zelwegger and her, shall I say, ""professorial"" five year old kid, (I'm being kind, I almost thought a grown-up actor was playing the role, so un-child-like was the boy's performance, never mind the dialogue he's given to speak).And no, I didn't like Cuba Gooding's over-the-top performance as Cruise's only remaining client after he alienates his former employer and co-workers with a mass-circulated touchy-feely ""mission statement"" to cleanse his conscience and soul. Talking loud and saying nothing, as James Brown once said. There were a few good lines and situations but these were hopelessly outnumbered by many more which were poorly conceived and executed and while I understand ex-Rolling Stone magazine writer Cameron Crowe filling up the soundtrack with 60's and 70's tracks by the Who, Stones and McCartney, none of the songs has any relevance to anything in the film.As for the acting, it was universally flashy and shouty, with no exceptions and you can see each of the leads acting if you watch closely enough. For a far more incisive and entertaining exposé of the soft white underbelly of sports and at a deeper level, morality at large, I'd suggest viewers look at Billy Wilder's ""The Fortune Cookie"" instead.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
At the risk of my own cynical reputation...,"It's all well and good to stroll through life with a healthy air of scepticism, but despite some peoples' views on these supposedly 'manipulative' romantic films, there are an elite few that really do have things to say based on something more noble than ticket sales - things that are actually worth listening to.Jerry Maguire is one of these rare beasts. No, it's not perfect, and no, it doesn't ring true for every last second of its running time, but if you come away from it with a sneer rather than a genuine desire to take a step back and look at yourself, then there's no romance in your soul at all. It's a genre that's always been particularly susceptible to the flood of lacklustre money-spinners, so to come across something that's had so much visible thought and effort thrown into it from all corners is a revelation. I'm not naive enough to think that anything making it big in the film industry these days can be purely a labour of love, but Jerry Maguire at least comes close.It's refreshing to see Tom Cruise demonstrate that, against all odds, he can act his heart out when given the right role, as can Cuba Gooding Jr. (neither of them better previously or since) - and the rest of the cast give it every bit as much passion. It's beautifully written, and shot with an easy style that makes me wish there were more directors like Cameron Crowe in this world.And on top of that, it gets better with each viewing. Even the soundtrack feels as if weeks have been spent fine-tuning it to perfection, and I'm no fan of Springsteen or Tom Petty. Deride it if you like, I'm not saying that Jerry Maguire's totally free of sentiment... I'm just suggesting that it's not necessarily a bad thing to have your heartstrings tugged and your self-awareness questioned once in a while.",,Anonymous,Romance
"""Show me the money!""","Jerry Maguire may be rather overlong and a little pedestrian in places, but overall it is a very interesting and somewhat unusual film. The concept really intrigued me and one of the main reasons why I saw Jerry Maguire in the first place, and this concept worked really well thanks to the well written story and the witty and poignant script. Jerry Maguire is also beautifully filmed with lovely cinematography and scenery, and the soundtrack is warm and infectious. Cameron Crowe's direction is very good, as are the relationships between the characters. Jerry Maguire also benefits from some superb performances. Tom Cruise gives one of his best performances here, and he is perfectly matched by Renee Zellwegger at her most beautiful and the adorable Jonathan Lipnicki. Though the real star is Cuba Gooding Jnr who is absolutely marvellous as Jerry's sole remaining client. To conclude, a very good film, well worth watching for the performances and concept alone. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

How beautiful is your sole?,"Jerry MaGuire is arguably the most beautiful film ever made. In fact, I don't believe there is anything quite like it. When I often encounter the typical passionless British citizen with a fat belly who works in I.T, who has nothing but dislike and hatred for Tom cruise (and this is common in Britain), it paints a clear picture of the emotionless society we British people live in.People in Britain often live life in a disheartened state. British people are often disheartened by their sexless marriages, their mundane jobs, and their cowardice nature that prevents them from embracing the many beautiful things about life.In my experience, more often than not, British people live unhappily (compared to American's anyway) and they point their fingers at wonderful people like Tom Cruise to make themselves feel better. Jerry MaGuire is often considered a cinematic catastrophe by the British  and it's all because the British have no idea how to connect with their souls.This is why we are famous for disparaging our great people (until they are dead of course), because we are a gutless nation with no zeal for life and the things that make our existence so special.America is the greatest country in the world, and I think it has everything to do with the fact that their people are generally the most affable, genuine, happy, good-natured, passionate, people on the planet. I think the overall opinion of great cinematography says everything about a nation and its people.Jerry MaGuire is a film that is held dearly in the hearts of the American people. A film of love, trust, friendship, loyalty, and all the essential attributes required to be a great human-being who makes others happy also.Jerry MaGuire is a film of passion that inspires the human spirit to become a better spirit  a film that illustrates the unique beauty of the American people that very few Brits fully understand and appreciate.I know I'm not one of those Brits.Jerry MaGuire: you are my ambassador of Quan!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
You had me at hello,"Jerry Maguire is a feel good romantic drama which surfed a zeitgeist wave in the mid 1990s and coined catchphrases such as 'Show me the money' 'You had me at hello' and 'You complete me.'Tom Cruise plays the successful sports agent Jerry Maguire who upsets his bosses with a mission statement such as having less clients in order to serve them better. His rival at the firm has to fire him and then compete for all his clients.Maguire is only left with one client, a mouthy, flamboyant football player Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding jr) who is upset that he is not getting the top endorsement deals. Maguire also is also chasing a hot shot player for the draft and thinks he has bagged him only to be snatched away by his rival.Maguire starts out at the bottom with Tidwell and Dorothy (Renee Zellweger) a single mother and one of the assistants from the sports agency who has followed him. Dorothy and Jerry fall in love but we are not sure if he genuinely confused her loyalty with love.Maguire needs to persuade Tidwell to play football with his heart and not think about endorsements or why other players are earning more. Tidwell shows loyalty and friendship to Maguire but in the football field he comes across as shallow and selfish. A reason why Maguire is struggling to get a lucrative contract deal for him.Jerry Maguire is actually a corny film, Cuba Gooding jr provides the laughs but the romance angle is very cheesy.At the end Maguire is successful because of the one to one relationship he has with his only client which other sports player are envious of.I saw this film again after 20 years because part of the scenes were featured in The Lego Batman Movie, the implication being some of the lines are hackneyed.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Excellence in Filmmaking,"This movie had me laughing; crying; smiling; staring; anticipating; everything.  When I viewed the voter history for this movie, I couldn't believe the rating it had received after 13,400 registered users had voted. This movie was excellent from the direction to the production sets.  The acting was superb by all but could not and would not have been as great if it had not been for the vision of the director.  I gave this movie a ten because it deserves it everywhere.  The scenes, the sequences, the editing were all great.  Though I'm not involved in the movie industry yet, I try to observe details in a production that make a good, bad, or great movie.  In this case everything fell into place.  The music for certain scenes was perfect.  The characters were extremely believable.  Everyone in the lead and supporting roles deserve an award of some type.  I'm a 49 year old male with two grown kids and two grandchildren but I'm not ashamed to say I was filled with emotion as I watched this film.  I believe a film should consume the viewer- to me that's great filmmaking.  If I can leave my seat or carry on a conversation while watching a film, it's not great- it might be good, but not great.  Jerry Maguire had my undivided attention.  Kudos to everyone involved in the production of this movie.

"""You Complete Me""","If Jerry Maguire were made 30 years earlier I can see Jack Lemmon playing the title role. You wouldn't think of Tom Cruise being up for parts that Jack Lemmon would have been cast for, but he does an incredible job in the role of go-getter sports agent Maguire who decides to leave the high pressure agency that Jay Mohr runs and going out on his own.Cruise has one of those chew the scenery moments when he leaves Mohr's office and secretary Renee Zellweger decides to leave with him. She's been crushing out on him for the longest time even though he's been seeing Kelly Preston. But patience can certainly be its own reward sometime.If Jerry Maguire lacks something it would probably be Billy Wilder's surefire wit and sense of satire. Jerry Maguire would have been a great film for him to write and direct. Satire however might have crowded out romance in a Wilder film.And it's romance that the movie going public likes with Tom Cruise. Some of his and Renee Zellweger's best scenes are with little Jonathan Lipnicki who is her son from a previous marriage. The kid is a scene stealer, mainly because he acts like a real kid, not some Hollywood creation.Cruise has some tough sledding at first, one client he had counted on was college sensation Jerry O'Connell who is being inundated with draft offers and endorsements. O'Connell and his family, despite the whole honest country boy shtick, do disappoint him.His one client who does stick with him is Cuba Gooding Jr. who plays Rod Tidwell, a running back for the Phoenix Suns. Tidwell's one egotistical handful and Gooding won a deserved Best Supporting Actor Oscar. However the reason he won it is that his portrayal of Tidwell is multidimensional. His scenes with wife Regina King and the rest of his family are far removed from the Muhammed Ali like face he shows the public.Cruise also was nominated for Best Actor in the title role. But he lost to Geoffrey Rush for Shine. In fact Jerry Maguire lost for Best Picture to The English Patient. I was pulling for Tom that year myself.Though I think a lot of Billy Wilder type satire was missed, Jerry Maguire is still a very well done film. Maybe it needed a Billy Wilder to direct it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
a feel-good treat concocted with a conscience,"For those who endearingly miss Tom Cruise as a fine actor, or Cameron Crowe at the top of his games, JERRY MAGUIRE is a blast from the past. Our titular hero (Cruise) is a smug predator in a cutting-throat capitalistic business, who suddenly grows a conscience, and then immediately makes a wrong move, trying to exhort his peers to also grow a conscience, unfortunately the majority of those is too cynical to accept his noble motion, he is therefore blackballed and according to Murphy's law, must hit the rock bottom, which only leaves him a loyal admirer/accountant Dorothy Boyd (Zellweger), his only client, an under-the-radar football star Rod Tidwell (Gooding Jr.) and a goldfish.Tailored to USA's pernicious winner/loser ethos, the subsequent upswing must diligently tackle two most important things a man must obtain, his career and his love life, to prove the world that he is not a loser but a bona-fide winner, aka, it is the ""kwan"", that really matters to one's truth worth, a magically coined word by Crowe. Cogently the film thrives as a sincere page-turner albeit Crowe being rather deferential towards all the genre tropes, his script coruscates with a cordial sympathy towards Jerry's fix and a tangential self-awareness of eschewing the mawkishness, conceivably, it is a story borne out of affection and deliberation, but one defective looms large in the end is that Crowe doesn't get more into the agent business maybe because it is not his forte, the triumphalism is approached through Rod's doughty sportsmanship (a cinematic but garden-variety antic with a sharp tang of cruelty, in real life, more often than not, a player is physically permanently damaged), and what Jerry has attributed to the triumph is regretfully left largely untapped, however he would right this wrong in his next film ALMOST FAMOUS (2000), which is more in his element, inspired by the days when he was a contributing editor of Rolling Stones Magazine.One might argue JERRY MAGUIRE is the film where Tom Cruise's Hollywood golden-boy charisma is in his highest voltage, and his effort is incontrovertibly contagious, ever so remarkable he devotes himself entirely to a character which is quite self-referential in a manner (riding a money- seeking business, deviled by commitment issue, cannot deal with being alone), sheds self- consciousness and flexes his muscles to bring forth exigency, compassion and warmth, in company with a honest-to-goodness romance playing off against a self-abasing Renée Zellweger, who also punches above her weight in a conventional ugly-duckling role but spiffed up with a strong sense of dignity and sensibility, she knows when to waive what doesn't worthy of her even it is what she really wants, that is in my humble opinion, the most valuable takeaway of the whole movie. The homey atmosphere is also magically graced by a heart-melting Jonathan Lipnicki as Dorothy's cutie son and Bonnie Hunt's protective but amenable elder sister (although that divorced women group gag should be relegated to a cheesy chick flick dud).Lastly, about Cuba Gooding Jr.'s Oscar victory, he does strut his stuff with a highfalutin bravado, errs on the side of being clownish but essentially an entertaining hoot, like the film per se, a feel- good treat concocted with a conscience.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

A boring and pretentious three hours,"I went to this film, not knowing what to expect.  I'm not a big Tom Cruise fan, but I'm a sports fan, and hey, this is a sports movie. Big mistake.  I suffered through three hours of seeing Renée Zellweger (very talented actress, this was the first time I saw her) say that Tom Cruise's character was such a great guy for actually saying he should spend time on his sports athlete clients.  At the expense of other clients. Zellweger does a good job, though there's no reason why her character or anyone else would quit her job because some guy wrote a few words about caring.  Many of us receive stuff like this in regular inspirational e-mails from our bosses or coworkers, and see what Dorothy (Zellweger) failed to see -- it's talk, and it's cheap. Cruise spends three hours trying to show that he cares about something or everything.  There's little reason to see this as anything but acting through the lines in the script, as Cruise never once manages to show that he does care. The great thing about this movie is how it resusciated Cuba Gooding Jr.'s career from unwarranted obscurity.  Aside from that, there's little to like here.  Why should any of us care that an agent got his prima donna star athlete a great contract?  Most of us work for far less in a decade than Maguire's one commission in an afternoon.",,Anonymous,Romance

I watched this movie recently, knowing nothing more than the famous ""Show me the money"" quote. Romantic comedies can be a bit of a hit-an-miss category too.

An average film made better with strong performances,"Jerry Maguire was released a good few years ago and, despite knowing a few of the quotes from the film, I had never seen it. I knew it was Tom Cruise as the sport's agent Jerry Maguire, but never really knew the ins and outs of it. I was quite surprised to find out it has a good hint of comedy in it, and isn't as sporty as I thought it was. I was shocked when I sat down to watch this.The film begins showing Maguire as a hot shot agent, who represents many top sport stars across the country. One night however he has an epiphany and writes a 'mission statement' about how his agency should worry about the cliental instead of the money. He posts this 25 page mission statement in everybody at the company's pigeon hole and is greeted at work the next day with a huge round of applause. The big bosses of the company though don't agree with his document and instantly fire him, to be fair why would a company earning millions want to stop earning millions?After being fired he heads off to set up his own business, but first tries to persuade his current sport stars to come with him. They all choose to stay with their current representation, apart from one who is willing to still use Mr Maguire as his agent, Rod Tidwell (Gooding Jr). Maguire's company consists of himself and, an assistant who followed him from his former job, Dorothy (Zellweger). The company gets off to a bad start when the biggest football star in the country drops him and goes with Maguire's former company, leaving Maguire to put all his worth into Tidwell, who is an egotistical footballer with a severe attitude problem.As the film goes on Maguire and Dorothy begin to fall for one another, and Tidwell becomes more of a friend than a client. Maguire and Tidwell, who both have different views on life, manage to teach each other subconsciously how to be the men that will make their career flourish. It isn't really a film about sport, it is more about the relationship people have, and especially since it is stated, Maguire struggling to be alone but lacking intimacy with anyone he is close to. The themes are deep, much deeper than a typical sports movie.The script for the film is very good. The characters are so well drawn, and each one manages to bring something to the forefront, all to aid in Jerry Maguire's development as a person. The character of Tidwell is a great character and he is so pivotal for the outcome of this movie. The characters are also aided by some great acting. Cruise is very good in his role here, and is utterly believable as Maguire. He has the look and the mannerisms of an arrogant sports agent. Tom Hanks was originally slated for the role, but Cruise is definitely the right choice for it. Cuba Gooding Jr. is very good as Tidwell. He is over the top, brash and smitten with his wife. Gooding Jr. brings this character to life so well and thoroughly deserved his Oscar for Supporting Actor that year. Zellweger is also on top form as Dorothy. Her scenes with Cruise are full of emotion, and their chemistry is full of romance, despite one very uncomfortable scene where he kisses her all over on the doorstep. She is clearly in love with Maguire, and Zellweger shows this very well.The film does have a good script and a strong cast but it isn't the best movie out there. The best this movie could possibly be is average. It is an easy watch but the middle sector especially is a little dull. The opening of the film, where we see Maguire have a slight breakdown, is good but it begins to run out of puff towards the end. It is a fairly long film and probably doesn't need to be. The end has a strange climax, and I wander why Tidwell manages to become a bigger star due to him having an injury on the pitch. It was something I just didn't understand. At the end they also announce Tidwell's new contract on the air of a television show, would they do that? Why would people want to hear about it? If anything I would say that would put fans off of him. Here it was pushing the audience to love the football star but why would you be happy for him securing a huge contract.Small issues with this film really bring it down. It isn't a bad film but it also isn't great. The script and the acting are good but there are points that really bring the film down. It is an average film at best, made better by the talent on show. It does have some brilliantly quotable lines, and if you haven't seen this than you will notice which ones I am on about when you watch it. Despite being average I would suggest you watch it, mainly because it is an easy watch and one you won't particularly be disappointed with.3 / 5For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

You had me at Jerry...,"Every person is probably bound to have to take a look at his/her life at some point or other. Movies often like to use this as a plot, but not all pull it off. ""Jerry Maguire"" manages to pull it off. As the sports writer title character, Tom Cruise makes the most of himself (something that he too often doesn't do). Fired from his job, he hooks up with single mom Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellweger), and goes through a further life-changing experience.It's hard to say who has the best role in this movie. Without a doubt, Cruise and Zellweger do very well in their roles - Zellweger was clearly showing the talent that she would later bring to ""Chicago"" and other movies. Cuba Gooding Jr. won Best Supporting Actor for his role as athlete Rod Tidwell. The imperfect but assertive Tidwell is a hard character to qualify, which is part of what makes him so interesting. Maybe ""Jerry Maguire"" wasn't the year's best movie, but I wholeheartedly recommend it. You'll never look at things the same way again.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
It was a poem I never wanted to end.,"Cuba Gooding Jr. nailed the role with a Touchdown. It was almost poetic- ignoring the minor flaws, this movie was touching and inspiring. Touching to the level that the relationship gets to you, the relationship of an agent and his client and inspiring in a way that we should never stop believing in ourselves and should never stop bettering ourselves.Change your life, write your own ""mission statement"". It was a different feeling seeing Cuba and Tom having tears in their eyes, specially Tom. For the first time I really saw an emotional performance from Cruise without his sometimes over the top charm.

More than a Sport's Movie,"A comedic yet romantic script provides one of Tom Cruise's finest acting performances. A controlled, well-polished production with memorable characters and even more iconic scenes.Sports agent Jerry Maguire tries to get back on his feet after being fired from his job. However, the only client he has is Rod Tidwell, a disgruntled football player who wants a better contract.They say that Tom Cruise would occasionally stand on a prop stool for various kissing scenes, some say embarrassing, others a perfect demonstration of his acting prowess (surely nothing is more embarrassing than ordering two curry's at an Indian restaurant in Birmingham). The actor, alongside Renee Zellweger, Cuba Gooding Jr and Regina King combine to form a forceful cast who all know their roles to full knowledge. The film leans more on its romantic side than humour, favouring Maguire's love life with Dorothy than his work life double act with Rod Tidwell whose character is one of the best portrayed in all of film. A strong blend of vibrant moments contrast to more intimate exchanges as the film sustains its over 2 hour running time swapping between the two in an appropriate and tolerable manner.Like all great sports films (The Way Back 2020 and Moneyball 2021) the displayed perfectionism of the conveyed sport is flawless, with clear research performed in pre-writing and production to make the film as authentic as possible. Tom Cruise cried when he first ready the script and no surprise he received his second nomination for an Academy Award a year later, Cuba Gooding Jr. Did win his accolade for supporting actor, his first and only Oscar.Jerry Maguire, in essence, is a series of episodes which come together to one grand finale. A fitting premise complimented by high quality writing and sensational acting performances - to pioneer one of the greatest pictures of the 90s.Show Me the Money!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Challenging Life of a Sports Agent,"Jerry Maguire isn't your typical sports movie. It dives deeper, exploring the ethics behind the big contracts and touchdowns. Tom Cruise shines as the charismatic agent who has a crisis of conscience, leading him to challenge the status of the conditions. His journey is both hilarious and humbling, especially with Cuba Gooding Jr.'s scene-stealing performance as Rod Tidwell, the wide receiver who hilariously demands Jerry ""show me the money!""But Maguire's real redemption hinges on Renee Zellweger's Dorothy Boyd. She's the voice of reason and unwavering support, the one who reminds him that success isn't just about numbers on a page. Their connection is the heart of the film, a reminder that love can blossom in the most unexpected places.While the film might take some liberties with the world of sports agents, it doesn't shy away from portraying the orginal nature of the business. It's a refreshing take on ambition and loyalty, questioning what truly matters in the face of professional pressure.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Outstanding,"A terrific mix of light comedy and several heartwarming moments make this film one of the most enjoyable film experiences that I've ever had.

A beautiful tale of true human emotions.,"I remember watching Jerry Maguire and being stunned by what I was seeing. The film's premise is a sharply real one which reminds us all of times in our own lives.  Many moments in the film portray events that happen to real people and not a glamourised sugar coated image of life as seen by a Hollywood producer.  The film is clever and touching as well as being made in a highly sophisticated style which after being broken up reveals much more than a simple love story.  The emotions shown are depicted with accuracy and confidence to such an extent that at points you actually forget you are watching a film and you become part of the universe which Cameron Crowe has skilfully created.  These reasons and many more which are too long to place on paper are why I believe this is the greatest film ever made, I urge you to attempt watching it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Feel - Good Movie That Made Me Feel Bad,"Come on people, give me a break.  Tom Cruise is a ""brilliant actor"", as long as his part is that of a smarmy yuppie scum bag.  'Coz that's what he is in real life.  However, a drunk SYSB is already beyond him, and giving him the part of a SYSB - turned - caring - new - man, as in this movie, is almost cruel.OK, Cuba Gooding Jr.'s acting is outstanding and genuinely funny (he got an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor), and Bonnie Hunt as Dorothy's ""disapproving older sister"" minimises the damage done by Cruise and Zellweger somewhat. But why do so many Hollywood flicks have to be so totally devoid of suspense and plausiblity and so full of sugary fakeness and drawing - by - numbers plot?Don't get me wrong.  I like escapist stories, I fancy Renée Zellweger something rotten, and I enjoy walloping in Hollywood mainstream middle - of - the - roadness, once in a while.

Nothing to Crowe about,"How much Tom Cruise can you take? On the evidence of this, about an hour. Cruise is taking over the world. In the first half hour you get every conceivable shot and angle of Cruise that's possible. View of Cruise walking through door. View of Cruise walking through airport lounge. Profile of Cruise. Close up of profile of Cruise. Cruise on phone. Cruise on phone close up. Zoom in on Cruise eyeballs. mid shot of Cruise. Mid shot of Cruise being irresistible to women. Never long shot, too far away from audience, they'll stop being aware that Cruise exists/is wonderful/is a winner. View of Cruise having sex. Standing up so we can see his face. It's a walking self-advert designed to make him even more successful. You can see nothing but Cruise but what you can't see is any acting. There is a reason for this. He can't act. He's never been able to act. In one scene he is drunk but there's no difference to when he's sober. He's incapable of conveying even a simple human gesture without a range of exaggerated ticks and waves. Kubrick was a bright man. He must have realised Cruise couldn't act but he hired him. This collective madness extends to the audience who seem to love him. I don't get it. Show me the money. Cruise needs to be shown a space that doesn't have money piled up. His fee for Mission Impossible 2 film must be the most lucrative financial deal in film history. He can't act and they keep showing him the money. I don't understand. Help me to help you. Explain America to me. It does not compute. Tom,Tom,Tom, wherever you go. He just gets more successful no matter how bad he is. His ego is so huge that in one scene he keeps hitting an overhead light although he is reported to be a shorthouse. Eric Stolz is in this picture. He's the same age and he can act. Show him the money. Give him the lead. Jerry O'Connel of sliders fame is in this film. He can act. He doesn't twitch. He won't laugh in an outrageously bogus manner when sharing a cute scene with a kid. Show him the money. Or let him slide to an alternative earth where Cruise is a janitor. He'd stay, believe me. But they keep showing Cruise the money. And he's hopeless. What does that say about corporate America and the people who go and see movies?

One of Tom Cruise's best!,"I have seen this movie two times. I liked it both times. The Story with Cruise as a unsuccessful sports agent suits him well. In this role it's possible for him to open himself and can do his best acting. I also like Renee Zellweger as the woman who always believes in Jerry Maguire and the harmony between this two actors is very fine. But of course it's significant to mention the oscar winning performance of Cuba Gooding Jr. Whenever this actor is on the screen in this movie he shows us that he enjoys the work like nobody else. In my opinion they could have short the movie 10 - 20 minutes, so the movie has his lenghts sometimes but all in all it's a movie that's worth to be seen.

A sports agent finds the high road steep,"Tom Cruise, before his chin implant, is ""Jerry Maguire"" in this 1996 film also starring Renee Zellweger, Cuba Gooding Jr., Jay Mohr and Bonnie Hunt. Beautifully directed by Cameron Crowe, the film tells the story of a hotshot sports agent who writes a piece about the ethics of being a sports agent, encouraging a smaller client list and more personal service. He then passes it out to the rest of the agents in the firm, SMI. It goes without saying that he's fired, but before he goes, he asks if there is anyone who wants to go with him as he sets out on his own. A single mother, Dorothy (Zellweger), inspired by his missive though partially blinded by the stars in her eyes, says yes. Jerry ends up minus his fiancée (Kelly Preston) and stuck with one client (Gooding) that no one is particularly interested in, a football player whose mantra is ""Show me the money!"" But no one is. As he struggles to make a lucrative deal for his client, Jerry has to also deal with his personal life - Dorothy and her love for him, which he can't really return, her mistrusting sister (Hunt) and Dorothy's son (Jonathan Lipnicki) whom he adores.This is a fast-moving film with wonderful performances and lots of warmth, humor and honesty. Jerry learns quickly that when it comes to money, he's friendless, that there's very little loyalty and lots of liars. Tom Cruise is excellent as a young man trying to find his way through a labyrinth of a client with a bad attitude, no money, a hasty marriage and staying with the principles in his manifesto. Zellweger, in her career-making performance, is sweet and touching as Dorothy. Gooding has the most flamboyant part and makes the most of it as an athlete who has to learn that in order to have someone show him the money, he has to show a little heart first.A great movie, highly regarded for a reason, with a soundtrack to match. Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
brilliantly happy and passionately inspiring,"When I first saw this movie I just said `it was a great movie, but too pinkie'; then I saw it again, and I got out of the theatre thinking to myself `I'm in love'; now, every time I see it, I just thank heaven for not being a girl, or I would throw myself to the floor the moment Jerry enters the living room and would probably cry for at least 2 hours!  LOLFunny, touching, really human, through this film Crowe illuminates us with his vision about the world and the human being and relationships, no matter how hard life may look like. He could well be a good defendant of Frank Lloyd Wright's motto:`Beauty is just the brilliance of Men's light'Jerry Maguire is, above all, a great Cameron Crowe film, filled with happiness, energy, passion and talent, that touches all the romantic people in the world, as well as all others, I believe.When we see Tom Cruise looking at Zellwegger and saying: `That's more than a dress. That's an Audrey Hepburn movie', we just gotta feel immensely in love.Another really important aspect, that is starting to brand Cameron Crowe, is launching great actresses; in `Almost Famous' we finally see Kate Hudson, who only had minor parts to date, suddenly going to the Oscars and almost wining one; and here, in `Jerry Maguire', Renée Zellwegger has a great performance and jumps for the stars!If this `Jerry Maguire' has something wrong, then it is definitely timing; if it had been done 20 years ago, in the 80's, or maybe even much earlier, about 40 years sooner, then today many would be calling it a classic.

The key to this business is personal relationships.,"Jerry Maguire is a sports agent at the top of his game working for Sports Management International. They handle the lives of hundreds of athletes and negotiate the big bucks deals that get them everything they want. However, after a bad TV dinner in a hotel room, Jerry realises that this molly-coddling, not-telling-them-like-it approach, that the agents industry has put out their over such a long time might not be what's best for his clients, and decides to speak his mind with disastrous consequences. Armed with only one client who would stick with him, and the one assistant from his old firm who would stick by him, with the help of her ever-so-cute son, Jerry has to re-build his shattered life and reputation from scratch.The most apt description ever of this film is that it is a chick-flick for guys. Everything about this film screams chick flick, but because men folk are thick, because it has sports in it, we think it's for us. We're easily fooled! This for me was Tom Cruise's big breakthrough film, far from the confident, cocky, brash Tom Cruise we had seen before here was a different side, a human side, and it is his portrayal of Jerry, a man brought to his knees by an industry that doesn't care, that really sucks us in. You know that in spite of all the things that get thrown at him, he is a good person, and while he may have approached things the wrong way, his heart's in the right place, and it is inspired casting by Cameron Crowe and his team to get Tom in this role.The rest of the cast fill out their rolls superbly well, and Renee Zellwegger, Bonnie Hunt, Jay Mohr and Jonathan Lipnicki (Apologies for spelling folks) all are great in the rolls as assistant, assistant's sister, rival agent and assistant's son. However the big turn on the film other than Tom is Cuba Gooding Jnr as the under-rated Rod Tidwell, whose un-noticed form helps carry his team to greater things. So convincing is his portrayal, by the time you're midway through it you almost feel like your watching some fly on the wall documentary.The direction in this film is superb and this, along with ""Say Anything"" are arguably his best work. The script is one of the best I've seen out on the big screen and itnever lets you settle in you seat. But in spite of all the ups and downs of Jerry and the motley crew that gather round him of course this is a feel good film, and if you're not humming ""Shelter from the storm"" a few minutes after watching this film then you can show me the money.Nuff said.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Tom Cruise works admirably hard in formula comedy-drama-romance...,"Tom Cruise gives one of his looser, less self-conscious performances as sports agent Jerry Maguire, a self-described ""shark in a suit"" who loses his job with a high-profile company and strikes out on his own. Kelly Preston is the fiancée he loses touch with; Renee Zellweger is the single mom whom he connects with; and Cuba Gooding Jr. Plays a star football player and Jerry's number-one client. Literate, yet occasionally pretentious, overextended comedy-drama that uses every conceivable romantic-minded trick to wring tears from its sugar-coated scenario (including the single mom and her cute kid, the emotional client and his pregnant wife, and all those movie star grins in close-up from Cruise). It's a formula, yet one that pleased a lot of people. The film does work on a fantasy level, and Zellweger in particular really shines here, giving the slick proceedings a natural sheen that is both oddly charming and satisfying. Writer-director Cameron Crowe shows a fair amount of sophistication, despite the faint whiff of superficiality. Five Oscar nominations with one win: Gooding Jr. For Best Supporting Actor. Crowe was nominated by the DGA for his direction and the WGA for his original screenplay.

Why I Love to Hate Cameron Crowe,"Sitting alone in my living room on the sunny, yet frigid eve of Easter Sunday 2008 amidst six inches of snow that was dumped upon the Chicagoland suburbs the day before. Fueled by nicotine and caffeine I found myself straightening up my apartment and channel surfing when I happened upon an early morning screening of Jerry Maguire on TNT. That's right Jerry Ma-freakin-Guire. I found myself completely and utterly intrigued and drawn in despite the fact that I've seen this movie somewhere in the vicinity of 10-20 times before, typically on random weekend days on basic cable. First things first, I HATE, capital H through E, Renee Zelwegger and the charm of Tom Cruise died for me somewhere between Top Gun and his ill-conceived notion to pick up where L. Ron Hubbard left off on the proliferation of Scientology tip. And don't sleep on little Jonathon Lipnnicky, the cute little over-sized glasses wearing son of Zelwegger's character in the film, speaking of which, has he gotten arrested for marijuana/cocaine possession yet or fallen into the child-star trap yet? As I digress.Anyway, without even realizing it  it happened  the film had my undivided attention and I became emotionally invested in the subtle intricacies of the dialogue and was provoked to the point of inspiration, which in my humble opinion is truly one of the greatest pleasures on Earthbut to arrive at this point watching Jerry Maguire? What was wrong with me  had I become a softy in my late 20s? I even found myself getting the chills and near-tearing up as the relationship between Jerry (played by Cruise) and Rod Tidwell (Oscar winning performance by Cuba Gooding Jr.) progressed and Jerry left himself emotionally vulnerable, which apparently is atypical of your big shot sports agent in this day and age, only to win back his wife Dorothy (played by Zelwegger) with one of the more memorable lines in recent film history  'you had me at hello'.I then began realizing that despite my anti-Hollywood, screw all major studio releases attitude cultivated sometime between my junior year of high school and becoming a film studies major during my college days in Madison, WI, I did not hate Columbia TriStar or Cruise or Zelwegger or even Cuba (Gooding Jr.  not the home of Fidel Castro people). My hate was centered on Cameron Crowe, the only man with the verbiage and directorial skills to make me give a rat's arse about a movie like Jerry Maguire. The relate-ability of every facet of every relationship and every exchange between these actors that I truly love to hate is so deceivingly obvious and spot-on that I can't help but succumb to the magnetism and emotion of the scenes as they play out. I'm still watching the film and having this epiphany and rather than admit that it's the film I enjoy, I start shaking my head in disbelief amidst teary eyes and thrust all of the recognition and responsibility for the way I'm feeling on Mr. Crowe. I feel vindicated in doing so rather than chalk Jerry Maguire up as another guilty pleasure of mine, kind of like the Hanson song MMMBop. It's then that I decided I needed to write this, if not for the therapeutic function that it's currently providing me, but more so because I feel I owe it to Mr. Crowe.I'm a proud purveyor of classics like Fast Times at Ridgemont High (granted Amy Heckerling directed it), Say Anything and Almost Famous. I'm still trying to be half the man Lloyd Dobbler was in courting (pun intended) Diane Court and churning out 'In Your Eyes' through his ghetto blaster and longed to have experienced the 70s rock scene like William Miller in Almost Famous. Those films equally capture me emotionally, spiritually, have terrific soundtracks and when mixed together in only the way Cameron Crowe can - they inspire me to believe that possibilities are limitless and that anything can happen and eventually, will happen. And when they do, they'll inevitably involve me getting with the perfect girl amidst the backdrop of the perfect song to capture the all-encompassing essence of purity, honesty and lovewhether it is for Diane Court, Stillwater or Dorothy BoydAnd that is why I love to hate, but really just plain admire Mr. Cameron Crowe  or maybe I just enjoy his films. Either way, I think I made my some kind of point, right?",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Real Star of the show........,"Well I certainly don't need to recap the plot of the film, that has been taken care of by many others. My input for what it was worth really is to do with the casting of Jonathan Lipniki. Simply put, I thought he was outstanding. He really added some beautiful moments to the film and I only wish they could have cast him more. Sadly due to his very tender age and stamina levels at the time, they had to keep his cameo's short and to when he was at his best. But it was a lovely film all round, I loved how the characters evolved but for me it was held together by Ray. I can watch his parts over and over. From what I've seen since, Jonathan adored Tom Cruise and I think that is clear to see in the chemistry on screen.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Tom & Cuba,"This movie would have been better if it had just concentrated on the relationship between Tom & Cuba.  I never saw Tom have so much chemistry with a co-star. At times this movie felt like a male love story masquerading as popular entertainment.  But you had to put up with the ever-annoying other members (except Bonnie Hunt & Jerry O'Connell) of this ensemble, and God knows I can live without ever hearing THAT phrase ever again.  All in all, I'd recommend the movie, but probably not for any reasons that would be widely acceptable. Cuba's Oscar was deserved and his acceptance speech was the highlight of the night.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Is this what we've come to?,"If Jerry Maguire is a typical American, give me a one-way ticket to Winnipeg.  This is a film whose values are so out of whack that it shocks me that it's universal acclaim confounds me.  The film tells us the following: money is important, public affection is important (sure Cuba Gooding and the Daughter from ""227"" are a cute couple, but if they were making out at a restaurant in front of me, I'd slap 'em till they were insane), jazz is bad and lame (I guess John Coltrane and Miles Davis aren't as venerable music talents as Heart), and of course, America sets the tone for the world. The whole film can be summed up with one sequence.  Rod Tidwell catches a touchdown and inspires a nation on Monday Night Football.  What does that mean?  Tidwell can now bank on a fat new contract.

Don't waste your time on one.,"Don't waste your time on this shallow movie. This is one of those movies where the script my have been designed by a committee in a board room of a major movie studio. ""Let's get Cruise....oh, and sports are real popular now with the beer drinking public. Plenty of room for product placement if we can get it. Let's put Cruise and Sports in a movie together. Wait, Cruise doesn't play sports. Ok, let's make him an attorney people most like that cause there are lots of attorney shows on TV, no wait, a sports agent. He can yell into the phone he wants more money. Someone come up with a phrase. That's it, ""Show me the money"". Get someone from the writing pool to knock this thing out. Oh, and put in a little kid with glasses and a single woman he will be insincere with who he stays with out of loyalty cause it is too hard to write sincere romantic heartfelt relationships.""It seems the writer of this film tries to convince people that simply yelling ""Show me the money"" into the phone is going to get you more money. Cruise plays a sports agent. While that might sound exciting to those 10 year olds that are into football, sports agents are about as exciting as overhearing an attorney talk on the phone about the fine points of a business contract. Since Cruise can't be the sports player in this film, they made him a sports agent. The role of the sports player goes to Cuba Gooding Jr who is directed to act like a buffoon of the likes of Martin Lawrence. This is a sad use of Gooding. He pulls this stupid stunt and for some reason the magic of the offers come in for him as a player. As any 10 year old knows, football is about playing the game and winning it. It is about gaining yards, making touch downs. That and that alone is why big money is paid to sports. Who knows what this movie started out to be and what it ended up being leaves you questioning what is actually happening in this movie. But if you are the type who talk through movies, or watch them typing at the computer, then you won't notice how lame this movie is.",,Anonymous,Romance
"remembered for so much, and it's actually a pretty good movie","Tom Cruise is so Tom CRUISE here he out Tom Cruises when Ben Stiller has done Tom Cruise (or should I say Tom Crooze?) He is practically everything that he has ever been asked to do as an actor, minus the running and action stuff (oh, no, wait, he does run a little bit in the climax, how about that) and it's one of his major performances (to the point where I wondered a few times if this could be an unintentional sequel to Risky Business). He, and not Cuba Gooding Jr (who is fine but given a largely two dimensional character, a type to be sure), deserved the hell out of that Oscar. This is his movie, and he rules at every moment.The movie around him is fun and entertaining, and it's Cameron Crowe also at his most...Crowe-ish (for better or worse, mostly better, from his can't-help-himself wit to the musical choices, from the Who to Miles Davis), though not as deep as it might think it is early on. It also has a wonderful turn from Renee Zellwegger, a sleazy turn by Jay Mohr, and Jerry O'Connell for a few key scenes in one of his best turns (hey, no small roles, right?) The key thing for me about all this: Jerry Maguire was one of my cinematic blind spots until... Well, now.I knew all of the major cultural references (it's just how it is, whether it's seeing a parody long before the actual source, to a Patton Oswalt bit about seeing it on Christmas), and seen a few scenes here and there, but I'd never seen it start to finish. What I come away with is... It works. Mostly. Largely on movie star charm and some snappy Crowe dialog that only occasionally is too, uh, cocky for its own good.It also is a much more compelling story when it's focused on the sports world, and the first part seems to be indicating it'll be largely about that. And then roughly halfway through, when the thrust of the story should be about how Jerry picks up the pieces and gets back on track, Crowe remembers he wants to kick in his romantic comedy/drama plot and it takes over. Arguably, a bit too much and yet, there are some really touching scenes late in the film between Cruise and Zellweger, like it almost makes up for a sluggish middle.Jerry Maguire, not without flaws, is what used to be a quality example of a popular and massive Hollywood hit in the mid 1990s. I wonder now if it would go straight to Netflix or not, with a different star. Is it still an iconic Hollywood piece of the 90s? I dunno. But I did laugh. And I could see how Crowe could go down the path he has for the last 15 years.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Soul Reclamation,"As upset as I get with him, I can't help but like Tom Cruise. He does a nice job as the irrepressible Jerry Maguire, a sports agent making it big, but feeling empty about it.

It's not easy and soon he is without a job and without a single client. The only one who goes with him is young Renee Zelwigger. Cruise's fiancée and just about everyone else (even those for him he made big money) bales on him. What is left is a twofold plot.

Not sure whether this is a chick flick or just a generic bad movie...,"I saw this a few years ago, and didn't quite see why everyone was praising it so much. I attempted to watch it again a year or two later, still desperately trying to figure out what everyone was praising the movie for. Then I borrowed it from the local library a few days ago, and today I saw it again... I'm still as baffled by its reputation as a good film as I was when I first saw it. It seems to be a chick flick, since just about all of the elements are there... but maybe it is just a generic bad movie that has gotten popular because of the star power or whatever. I mean, everything in the movie... the obnoxious little kid, the weak attempts at comedy mostly consisting of old stereotypes, the unbelievably poorly implemented and uneven love-story... no. Just no. I can only guess that the popularity of this film lies in a strong audience of people who are either easily impressed or girls who are into chick flicks. Possibly both. The plot is OK, but the pacing is awful. It moves unforgivable slowly and seems twice as long as it is... at least. The acting is flat or overplayed... everyone seems either terribly uninterested in the material or to not be sure how to perform, and therefore overdo it. I can't believe that this was actually done by Cameron Crowe... come on, he made Almost Famous and Vanilla Sky, two movies that are great at best and impressive at the least. How could he screw this up? I recommend this film only to the biggest fans of the people involved in the making of it, and possibly fans of chick flicks. Everyone else; don't listen to the hype. It's not the least bit interesting or involving. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Overrated!,"Jerry Maguire is perhaps the most overrated film of any Oscar winner. I'm not saying that this film is bad, but it's not really that great either. Basically, this film is a decent chick flick with elements for men and women.Tom Cruise plays a sports agent similar to baseball's Scott Boras. He eventually loses his job and it's up to a football player played by Cuba Gooding Jr. to find himself.The acting is great. Maybe Gooding does deserve an Oscar. Tom Cruise once again did something right. This film also boosted Renee Zellweger's career.The reason this film is overrated because the story is lame. You see the same thing happening in almost every chick flick. Gets boring after awhile.I did like the music. There are some great tunes by Bruce Springsteen.Overall, this is a decent flick. Why it got nominated for 5 Oscars, I don't know. I rate this film 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
a good sports agent movie with some schmaltz,"I like Tom Cruise, he plays Tom Cruise really well, and this is no different. Jerry Maguire is a Sports Agent who after an epiphany of conscience sets up on his own. That's when Renee Zellweger brings the unlikely into the plot. Everything apart from Jerry's relationship with Dorothy in this film is plausible. Bonnie Hunt (always a good bet) plays the sensible sister whom Dorothy could listen to once in a while. Sure it plays out in true Hollywood fashion - yay - but I get angry at characters like Dorothy Boyd, annoying and silly. Tom is great, Jay Mohr (Sugar, the rival agent) plays sleaze so well, Cuba Gooding Jnr's flamboyant extrovert over-the-top manic is perfect for his role as Rod Tidwell and he really brings some crazy sanity to the other side of the plot which is the schmaltz of Jerry and Dorothy and corny dialogue. His relationship with Jerry is heartwarming, and the bromance between them is the real love interest of the film. Regina King is great as Mrs Tidwell, although I've only seen her play similar roles.Jerry Maquire is rightly hailed as a modern classic film, and whilst I find the romance between Dorothy and Jerry a little ridiculous and far-fetched, it does make it appeal to a wider audience that would other wise be only sports fans. It makes the film cover more genres, makes it different to other sports-films by giving it a number of story threads. Whilst it is predictable and has a very Hollywood ending, you don't really mind as it rounds the package of this film off nicely and it wouldn't have worked so well any other way. Special mention in this film has to go to little Jonathan Lipnicki who plays Dorothy (Renee's) son Ray; he's as cute as a button and adds some rather natural acting for one so young (age 5) as the child who melts Jerry a little bit. Overall, a great movie you can watch over and over, and one of Tom's best roles.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Feel good comedy-drama his the mark,"Jerry Maguire seems to be a passion project by Cameron Crowe who directs, writes and produces and he really hits the sweet spot with this movie about a sports agent with a conscience. You can see why it did well at the box office as it has something for everyone and you can imagine a couple going to the cinema together and both parties being equally enthusiastic to see it. There is a wonderful blend of drama, sports, business, comedy and love... and it really works well.It is well scripted and the characters are really fleshed out over the generous (though not over-long), runtime. Particular credit has to go to Cuba Gooding Jr. As NFL player Rod Tidwell, who rightly won an Oscar for best supporting actor. It would have been easy to make his character unlikeable to the viewer, but Gooding Jr. Adds a warmth and cheekiness that makes us warm to him despite the obnoxious nature and 'chip on his shoulder'. Cruise is also well cast as a sports agent with a conscience and gives an underrated performance here.The number of memorable and quotable lines from this film is impressive; ""Show me the money!"", ""You had me at hello"" and ""Help me, help you"", all are credit to Crowe and the quality of the script. The soundtrack also deserves a mention as it is filled with iconic and perfectly appointed songs, and again credit to Crowe and his then wife Nancy Wilson (of 'Heart' fame) for this bonus.It's really hard not to like this movie and it's one I enjoy revisiting and despite being nearly 30 years old, it hardly ages. Highly recommended if you have not seen it yet.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Jerry Maguire,"""Jerry"" (Tom Cruise) is a successful sports agent who spins the most outrageous yarns to his would-be clients in return for their business and could probably sell sand to a Bedouin. Then, well he has a bit of a brain freeze and decides to reveal some of the tricks of his trade to the great unwashed. All that does it get him canned, but not before he can rescue one client from his rapidly dwindling sources of employment. That is American football nonentity ""Tidwell"" (Cuba Gooding Jnr.). Now he's a bit of a pratt, but is a decent and untypically loyal cove who is happily married to ""Marcee"" (Regina King) and he has potential for a $10 millions contract - if only he can knuckle down and show he has that elusive star quality that brings in the big bucks. Meantime, ""Jerry"" meets and falls head over heels with ""Dorothy"" (Renée Zellweger). They marry but we quickly discover that that's not the adrenaline rush he is needing. Yep, he needs his bro-dance partner to get onto that ball park and do the business. This sees one of Cruise's more natural performances as he delivers, initially at any rate, quite a compelling impersonation of a venal manipulator out to promise the moon. As the story moves along, though, his role is rather subsumed into a gloop of cheese that's only really saved by an engaging and enthusiastic effort from a no holes barred Gooding who enters into the spirit of his character quite enjoyably. Zellweger has her moments too, but for the most part her character is consigned to a fairly predicable story arc that doesn't really add much to what is essentially a story about loyalty and learning to appreciate what really matters in life. Well that, and a sock in the eye to the old boss too! It's quite pithily scripted and whizzes along poking a little fun at the excesses of an industry that massively overpays for mediocrity, hype and is largely devoid of folks with too much soul.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Behind every great man, there is a (great) woman ...","Is ""Jerry Maguire"" a heart-warming romantic comedy with sports as a subplot? Or a sports drama with romantic undertones? Or is it a fascinating character study introspecting the professional and private life of a sports pro manager, and the way these two poles of his personality influence and affect each other? I like the third option, especially since the title says it all; it's a film about a man named Jerry Maguire.So, who's Jerry Maguire? At first, he strikes as the kind of character tailor-made for Tom Cruise; Maguire is the guy who's successful both in business and privacy. In fact, the two worlds interact so intensively that you can't quite differentiate between his friends, his colleagues and his clients, even his fiancé, Avery (Kelly Preston) is an ex-athlete. Tom Cruise is the ultimate yuppie and he plays the part perfectly with this extraordinary capability to make himself unlikable enough so you can better perceive his redemption, the same way he did in ""Rain Man"". But ""Jerry Maguire"", as if Cameron Crowe, the director, was already aware of its viewers' expectations, is pleasantly surprising because the redemption comes right at the beginning.After a series of eye-opening incidents, one night, Jerry wakes up and has a sort of breakthrough illumination; he realizes that he wasted his life, by cumulating a generous quantity of clients (professional athletes) without taking time to understand them, to deal with them in a decent way. Struck by this rebirth of humanity, he writes an inspirational memo titled ""Things We Think But Do Not Say"". The memo elevates him into a sports management guru status except that he's the only one who seems to believe in his new humanistic theories  him, and a young accountant, Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zelwegger) who 'saw the light' through Maguire's inspirational words. And naturally, when Maguire is forced to leave the company, she's the only one who chooses to follow him, she's the kind of women who stand for her beliefs.Then, Jerry and Dorothy work together with the only client who stays, Rod Tidwell, a football player, smaller than average, flamboyant, truculent  maybe a little too much, and he's played by a scene-stealing (and Oscar-winning) Cuba Gooding Jr. And it's funny how Gooding seems to embody the trademarks of Tom Cruise's archetypal characters through his cockiness and exuberance, but that's part of his 'character', I mean within the movie. Tidwell believes he's a great man, and naturally behind him, there's a woman, his wife Marcee (Regina King) who keeps a vigilant eye on his career's evolution. She doesn't trust Maguire but she gives it a shot. Tidwell trusts him and stays out of loyalty. And Boyd genuinely loves him because she knows there's something good inside that man. Maguire is a good guy because good people believe in him, and it works the other way, too.Indeed, the 'friends' in the beginning, the pedant Bob Sugar (Jay Mohr) and Avery, not to mention the cocky football player named Cush (whom I just discovered, was the chubby Vern from ""Stand By Me""), they all represent the dark side of Maguire's world, and it's only when he gets fired, when he leaves Avery and is betrayed by Cush' father who ends up signing with Sugar (leaving Tidwell as Maguire's only option), it's only when he's an outsider from that cynical world, that we start rooting for him. And Cruise is perfect because it's crucial that Maguire starts being unlikable enough so we can give him the benefit of the doubt and then supposedly change but not enough to make us lower our guard.The suspicion must remain whether he's a good or a bad guy, if he's going to make it because he believes in his ideas of if he's going to sell his soul back to the devil. It's a two- way process, Rod considers him a friend, not his wife. Dorothy loves him and so does her adorable little kid, Ray, but her sister (Bonnie Hunt) is perplexed. Well, we expect a happy ending, but it's all in the ""how"" and ""when"" it will happen. The film deals with human relationships with a powerful mix of cleverness suitable for a comedy drama and touching tenderness, incarnated by the beautiful Renee Zelwegger, in a breakthrough performance that should have earned her an Oscar nomination. She's so adorable, so unbelievably sweet, that she puts something new and unusual in romantic comedies: genuine, shameless, passionate and innocent love.There is something quite gutsy in the way Cameron Crowe's film tries to cover sports, character study, romance in one story, but the multi-layered format works because Jerry Maguire remains the center of gravity. Dorothy Boyd is a great character because she awakens the best out of Jerry and saves him from his own megalomania. Ironically, Jerry does the same with Rod, also blinded by his own ego too and obsession with money. The way the two stories interact transcends a lot of predictable elements, and even when it doesn't avoid some archetypal situations, the acting makes everything believable. We know that Maguire will get back to Dorothy, but the way it's handled never feels forced and insincere. Jerry listens to Rod who's got the greatest day of his career, and he's simply talking to his wife. Jerry knows he can be a great man, but only if behind him, there's a woman, not any woman: a 'great' woman.The film is notorious for having introduced many iconic lines in Cinema's Dictionary: ""show me the money"", ""you complete me"" and last but not least ""you had me at 'hello'"", a line that owes more to its awkwardness than romantic appeal. Interestingly, the romantic catchphrase was used in the American Film Institute's 100 Passions montage right after Nicholson's ""You make me want to be a better man"". And after watching ""Jerry Maguire"", I understood this is exactly why Dorothy Boyd was a great woman.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

DRAMA/ ROMANTICNot bad as a drama film co-produced, written and directed by Cameron Crowe which stars Tom Cruise as sports agent, Jerry Maguire bidding and gambling for the next big sports star. The film overall experience kind of has a preppie, superficial kind of look throughout, well made regardless of it's running time. Renee Zellweger shines as the love interest Dorothy Boyd!

"Enjoyable, but ultimately a little over-sentimental.","A different Tom Cruise movie, but why does Cruise only play the one basic character - arrogant, slightly vulnerable men? Only in ""Born on the 4th of July"" did he ever deviate from this role. An enjoyable and believable story EXCEPT for the over-sentimental romantic sub-plots between Maguire and Dorothy and the Tidwells. Maybe I'm just too old and cynical. Also, ""Jerry Maguire"" would have benefited from being twenty or thirty minutes shorter.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the great 90s movies (and there were a lot of those),"People talk about quotable movies. (Should there be an 'e' in quotable?) Anyway, for example, Withnail & I, supposed to be quotable, but it's not really. How often do you get to say, ""We want the finest wines available to humanity?"" Never, cos you can't afford them. But getting back on the track, appropriately as this movie's about a sports agent, JERRY MAGUIRE is full of famous, semi-quotable lines:You complete me.Help me help you.Show me the money.-You had me at 'Hello'.A human head weighs eight pounds.Please remove your **** from my ***.Ok, a couple of those are maybe harder to find the right context.Tom Cruise's last shot at an Oscar worthy role, realistically. The movie that made us fall in love with Renée Zellweger, and maybe also Bonnie Hunt and Regina King. We were already in love with Kelly Preston, until this one. And of course we all fell in something good for Cuba Gooding Jr. Heavens, the last movie I watched before this was Only You (1994), starring another junior actor, Robert Downey Jr. Man did that suck! Cuba got the Oscar and Cruise set his mind to becoming the greatest action movie star of them all, as Ethan Hunt.This movie, better on dialogue than on story if we're honest, but chock full of unforgettable scenes good humour, is far more hit than miss, and for the most part handsomely acted by all concerned. Again, comparing it to that recent disappointment (Only You) it is in a different class as regards script, direction and music, and it also has much more star power to buoy it up.This is a comedy that is as much a buddy movie as it is a romantic labyrinth, and it is as funny as it is romantic.One of Cruise's best movies.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bridget Jones before she was Bridget,"I don't know whether I liked this movie for what it was , or because of Renee Zellweger's character reminding me so much of the part she played in Bridget Jones's Diary.The only difference is that she plays this part with an American accent- other than that she's the same goofy, funny, hopeless but delightful Bridget that captured our hearts in the early 2000's.There is no doubt in my mind that the creators of BJD must have saw this movie and said - 'that's our Bridget Jones right there'The movie itself is a fun romp- it moves really fast and there are parts that I didn't fully get - mainly because I don't know anything about sports promotion - but you certainly won't be bored as the dialogue is slick and fast.Enjoy!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Right on the Money,"Show me the money. You complete me. You had me at hello. Jerry Maguire is Cameron Crowe's bread and butter. Without it, there would be no ""Almost Famous"". It's one of the most quoted movies of an entire generation. Perhaps that's what lessens the experience in retrospect. Oh yes, I liked this movie. I liked it a whole lot in a few sections. The beginning monologue and montage is absolutely golden. An exuberant, excellent hook that highlights the best of Crowe's ability, and why I admire him so much as a director. On that alone, the movie rockets itself into watchability, and seizes our attention for the 2 hours and 10 minutes it lasts. Rene Zellweger is really good here, as well as the ever adorable, Jonathan Lipnicki. Can we get a child star Oscar going? As if it wasn't enough, is ""Boyhood"" a better incentive to start? Cuba Gooding Jr., who won the Oscar for his performance, nails it. He's the smartest and funniest person in the entire film. He had Jerry in the palm of his hand the whole time, and he picked his brain like no other. SHOW ME THE MONEY, JERRY! The performances rule. What's the biggest flaw? Well, the screenplay. I know, 20 years down the line, any movie is going to become cliché, but for some reason, this movie has spectacularly clichéd moments. The closing speech that Jerry gives is one that really highlights it. So, freaking, corny. Cameron Crowe is a great writer (a genius actually), and this movie has many memorable scenes of dialog, but he's always had trouble with writing touching speeches.. something he's been struggling with pretty severely as of late...

This movie keeps getting better for me ...,"While Jerry Maguire is equal parts romance and sports-related movie, JM is among my favorites in both genres. And yes, I got sick of the phrase, ""Show me the money"" and even, ""You complete me"", shortly after its release, but that's not the fault of this movie.I'm not a huge Tom Cruise fan, but I think this is his best role to date. In JM, he is equal parts movie star and actor, and his scenes with everyone in the cast are great. Ditto for Renee Zellweger: I admit to having a bit of a love-hate (well, not quite that extreme w/ her.)..to me, she never looked better or did better acting - from the heart- (w/ out dipping into a bag of tricks a la Cold Mountain) than in JM. She is radiant, sympathetic, charming and shows great comic instincts as well.Cuba Gooding, Jr. was very worthy of an Oscar nomination (I personally would have had him runner-up to Wm. H Macy in Fargo that year) --nevertheless he energizes the movie in creating the inimitable Rod Tidwell. The other supporting players all hit just the right notes: Bonnie Hunt as the jaded older sister, Jay Mohr as the sleaz-o agent, Regina King (brilliant) as Marcy Tidwell, Todd Louiso as the nanny/child technician, Kelly Preston as the b__tchy fiancée, and on and on. And then, they're probably all upstaged every time little Jonathan Lipnicki appears as Ray (go on, name me a more endearing child performance - ever - in the movies). This movie offers terrific, sharp writing, great acting, solid pacing and perfect use of music as well, and a great blend of comedy, romance and drama. .. For me, this movie earns a rare 10/10! It's made w/ great care, is wildly entertaining, and is even more meaningful in the little moments than in the big ones ...full of terrific scenes, not just two or more enduring catch phrases!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
There's more to life than money,"You wouldn't think a sports agent would be a good choice to be the central character in any kind of romantic film. It is a profession with a reputation for sleaze and slime. But Jerry Maguire is not your typical sports agent. Well, he is at the start of the film. But then he has an ethical epiphany. Unfortunately this epiphany gets him fired from his high-powered agency. Jerry is left with just one client, Rod Tidwell. Rod, a wide receiver for the Arizona Cardinals, is brash, bold, bombastic and exceedingly self-confident. And with regard to Jerry he is interested in only one thing: ""Show me the money!"" When Jerry is cast out on his own with his one client he also has only one employee for his new start-up agency. That is Dorothy Boyd, a single mother who apparently was the only person at Jerry's old agency who shared his ideals. Or who was willing to admit she shared them anyway. She leaves her secure job to take a chance on Jerry and it becomes clear pretty quickly that she may have made a big mistake. But as Jerry flounders professionally he and Dorothy grow closer. They come to count on one another. They fall in love. At least they think they do. Their relationship is a challenge, a love story which it turns out may not include much love at all. Did they come together for love or for convenience? They know true love when they see it, as they do in the rock-solid relationship between Rod Tidwell and his wife. Seeing what Rod and his wife have only makes it more painfully obvious to Jerry and Dorothy what they are lacking.So this is a rather challenging romantic film. The main characters don't fall instantly in love and settle into a life of constant bliss. If this relationship is to succeed they are going to have to really work at it. It is an interesting journey Jerry and Dorothy take and director Cameron Crowe was fortunate to have two excellent performers filling those key roles. Tom Cruise and Renée Zellweger were at the top of their games here, playing off one another beautifully and creating two truly outstanding characters. The actors are certainly helped by Crowe's terrific dialogue, this is a script with so many memorable lines, both funny and poignant. Of course Cruise and Zellweger don't get all the best lines for themselves. Cuba Gooding Jr. shines, injecting so much life into the movie playing the outrageous Rod Tidwell. Bonnie Hunt provides some laughs as Dorothy's wary sister. Kelly Preston is a stunner, both in looks and in what she says as she plays another woman in Jerry's life. And there is also room for a wonderfully precocious child, Jonathan Lipnicki being incredibly endearing in that part. There's also Jay Mohr, Jerry O'Connell, Regina King, Beau Bridges...it is a really long list of quality performers and Crowe gives them all their moments to shine. There is a sense the movie struggles at times with the balance between comedy and drama. Is it a comedy that's trying to be dramatic or a drama that's trying to be funny? And how do you squeeze a romance into that mix? Oh, and it's sort of a sports movie too. Crowe really does have a lot going on here, maybe a little too much. But by and large it works. The movie manages to both entertain and charm you. And it is great to see the characters grow. Maybe even Rod Tidwell can come to learn that it is not all about the money.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Highly Entertaining,"Tom Cruise had a good year in 1996 showing everyone the money by starring in two of the top four grossing films of the year (""Jerry Maguire"", $153M; and ""Mission: Impossible"", $180M).  Of the two, ""Jerry Maguire"" was clearly the better film, garnering five Oscar nominations and winning a best supporting Oscar for Cuba Gooding, Jr.It is the story of a sports agent who falls from grace with his agency because he develops scruples and has the bad judgment to share his newfound principles with his firm.  This results in instant unemployment and the necessity to start his own agency.  Upon striking out with his trusty new assistant Dorothy (Renee Zellweger), he finds to his chagrin that the only client that stays with him is a loudmouth of a football player named Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) whose psyche is in a state of delicate imbalance.  As time goes on and his depression and debt get deeper, Jerry's only hope is that Rod can play football as well as he can talk trash.Writer/Director Cameron Crowe is excellent at writing amusing human-interest stories with offbeat themes (See Fast Times At Ridgemont High).  The combination of the high-pressure world of sports representation, a whacked-out client and a charming love affair makes for an engaging tale with something for just about everyone.Tom Cruise shines as Jerry Maguire.  He gives that character a false bravado that belies his desperate lack of confidence.  Yet, despite his feelings of hopelessness he never gives up, not on Rod, Dorothy or himself.  This film put Renee Zellweger on the map as Dorothy, Jerry's idealistic and loyal secretary and love interest.  She was enchanting and resolute as she stood by her man no matter what the costs.  Cuba Gooding, Jr. was fantastic and stole the show repeatedly with his over the top performance.This is a fast paced and highly entertaining film.  I rated it a 9/10.

A Very Likable Movie,"'Jerry Maguire' is a multi-genre film focussing primarily on the lives of a sports agent, an NFL playing, Oscar-winning Cuba Gooding Jr. and single mum Renee Zellweger. There is a certain feel-good factor to this film, as there are with most Cameron Crowe films which makes it very hard to dislike. The other great thing about Crowe's films is that everything is real from the characters to their emotions to the whole story. The casting of Tom Cruise is near-perfect as I could not imagine anyone to better portray an ambitious and willing sports agent. Asides the good movie and acting, this is surely one of the most quotable films to date with ""You had me at 'hello'"", ""Show me the money!!"" and ""You complete me"".

No one delivers old-school dramady like Crowe,"I finally re-watched this after about ten years, and it's still great after all this time. No one can bring out the emotion and heart out of, what in any other writer director's hands, would have been just another romantic comedy. Crowe's script is funny, warm and thoughtful, and he brings out the best in his cast. Cruise is as charming as ever, and Crowe's script offers a deconstruction of the typical shark character Cruise can play with ease by giving him a wife to not only love, but rely and depend on. Zellweger is charming and really pulls off playing a single mom without feeling too much like a movie star. Gooding Jr's Oscar-winning performance is delightful, but characters like (the perfect) Bonnie Hunt as Zellweger's ""disapproving"" sister or Jay Mohr as a scum-bucket agent bring out the natural charm and joy in Crowe's script and stop Cruise and Zellweger from turning the picture into just another romance.What really sets Jerry Maguire apart however is the focus that a successful marriage depends on both husband and wife giving themselves over to each other completely.

Nice story...,"""Jerry Maguire"" is a Drama - Romance movie in which we watch a very famous sports agent having under his guidance many top athletes when a night he has a moral epiphany after working for many hours. In his epiphany writes a text, prints it in many copies and distributes it to everyone in the firm he works for, he is fired and now he has to search as an independent agent for other athletes. Only one athlete stays with him and his former secretary.I enjoyed this movie very much because it had a very good plot and a well-written script. In addition to this, there is a nice direction with some plot twists that I didn't predict so, that made this movie even more interesting. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, I believe that Tom Cruise who played as Jerry Maguire made for one more time an exceptional interpretation and I also believe that Cuba Gooding Jr. who played as Rod Tidwell made his best interpretation so far (Academy Awards, 1997 Oscar Winner - Best Actor in a Supporting Role). Another good interpretation that has to be mentioned was Renée Zellweger's who played as Dorothy Boyd and she was very good at it. The direction which was made by Cameron Crowe was very interesting and I enjoyed the way he presented the many changes in the life of Jerry Maguire and how he had to fight in order to get back on track and also how this influenced his personal life and the people loved and cared him the most (great character evolution).Finally, I have to say that ""Jerry Maguire"" is a nice movie to watch with a very good direction, a well-written script and many good interpretations made by its cast. I recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am sure that you are going to enjoy it and you are going to have a lot of fun.

Sentimental and exploitative but it is very effective if you are in the mood for a romcom weepy,"Jerry is a sports agent and a very good sports agent at that. However when he suffers guilt at the nature of his business he proposed that his company take on fewer clients and put more personal care into them and prints up mission statements for all his colleagues. It isn't long before Bob Sugar is telling him that he is fired. Jerry decides to go it along but only manages to get two clients and one employee to come with him, but quickly even his small successes start turning into failure.Famous for its success, its awards and its catchphrases, this film tends to be loved by a lot of people and hated by a lot of people as well. Now the truth is that it is more or less in the middle in terms of quality and it needs you to meet it on its turf because it won't be coming to meet you. I say this because the film rather coldly aims for its target audience and rarely misses a trick for squeezing out emotion from a moment. Few viewers seem to care that Jerry's epiphany doesn't really see him seeking happiness outside of the world of money but just seeking to chase it in a different way. Others ignore the fact that the central romance of the film seems to be built on slogans and weak spots and even more viewers accept the fact that the emotions and characters rarely run deeper than superficiality. Of course the only viewers that will really hate these things are the viewers that hate the film as a whole, because OK, it does all these things but it is ruthlessly effective in how it does them. You may not like the fact that it does it but you have to admit that it is very effective! It is hard to criticise it for what it does because it is so clear what it is aiming for and it really doesn't seem to be aspiring for much more than that. You can see this in the music, which is good but is used to maximum effect whenever it is needed (I love the Springsteen song but it is used with the subtlety of a sledgehammer) but nowhere moreso than the use of Lipnicki as the impossibly cute child who is never anything other than cute comments and toothy smiles. In fairness he goes as deep as Cruise himself does because he doesn't really go beyond the movie idol level. Sure he does some soul-searching of a sort but he rarely risks being anyone other than Tom Cruise. Zellweger is served up with a hard task and she can't manage it. She comes across as so weak and submissive that she makes their love even less convincing than the script already does. Gooding Jr is better than he has been since (although his career has sort of gone into freefall since this high) although his character is very much the sort of role he can easily play and not anything that deep or complex. Mohr, Hunt and King all fill in the edges.Overall then a pretty manipulative and sentimental film that pushes all the buttons it can get in anyway it can. Some viewers will hate it for this while others (the majority it seems) will just accept it for what it is and embrace its easy emotion and cuddly billboard life messages and slogans. Very superficial and manipulative stuff then, but ruthlessly effective in its delivery.",,Anonymous,Romance

"Mediocre film, superior stars.","For the movie Jerry Maguire, a story about a sports agent who feels he isn't being completely honest in life and decides to write a career-changing mission statement about his thoughts, there really isn't too much wrong with it. There also isn't too much right with it as it is pretty straightforward the whole way through and lags in a few areas. However, the bright spots far outshine the dim ones in this terrifically acted story that tugs on the heartstrings and gives an inside look as to how the sports business is run.Written and directed by Cameron Crowe, this has the feeling of an insightful drama that wants us to consider how we conduct our lives and be brutally honest with ourselves and those around us. Indeed, there are plenty of long monologues about people not being honest with each other and how that affects our lives. I'm sure most of us already knew that, but that doesn't take away from this movie and how great the acting is by Tom Cruise as the title character, Renee Zellwegger as Dorothy, the woman who believes in him, and Bonnie Hunt as the no-nonsense sister. The show-stealer, though has to be Cuba Gooding Jr., who won an Oscar for his role as a loud-mouthed by very loyal athlete that is keeping Jerry alive. Certainly not a bad film, but just a mediocre, Jerry Maguire is fun to watch and learn from.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
just when I think Tom Cruise is done,"Every time I watch a Tom Cruise movie, I compare it to my favorite one, Rain Man.  Even though he wasn't the main character, I still feel that it is his best acting job.  The closest he has ever come to that is Jerry Maguire. When I sat and watched this movie the first time, I kept thinking to myself, ""This better be much better than 'Days of Thunder' or I'm walking out."" Then within the first five minutes, I was hooked.  Tom Cruise has some kind of magnetic charm over everyone in the world...it's scary.  So that is my favorite aspect of the film, the acting. Next is Cameron Crowe.  I thought that this movie was a little better than his previous work, Say Anything-which I love-and Fast Times At Ridgemont High-which is okay.  The writing seemed to be very similar to Say Anything, with the monologues and the quick dialogue back and forth between characters...and of course the dramatic love scenes. I also loved the child, Jonathan Lipnicki...he was so cute.  He is the kid that should be in every movie, but of course that is impossible. I wish that the movie would have been longer...or lingered more on the relationship between Jerry and Dorothy...I felt that that part of the movie went by way too quickly...but that is just me. Finally, I love the way the movie ends...it is one of those endings that makes you feel why they make movies anymore...besides, I know that I had you all, ""at hello...I had you at hello.""",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Overrated, I didn't like it.","Tom Cruise is very good in small doses. Especially with Dorothy's son, played charmingly by Jonathan Lipnicki, but in some of the bigger scenes his performance is so wrong-headed you can't imagine what he was thinking. The character for me was completely unlikable and irritating. The film itself It's a meandering and deeply shallow tale of spiritual redemption, built around the Teflon persona of Tom Cruise and driven by the conviction that all emotions worth expressing can be summed up in pop songs. Everything about Jerry, about Dorothy, about her unbearably cute son and her unbearably overbearing sister, is unconvincing, overbearing and formulaic.This is the second critically acclaimed Cruise movie I've not liked, the first being Vanilla Sky. I'm starting to think it's maybe Cruise that's the problem for me.",,Anonymous,Romance

An incredible jouney of emotion.,"Few films get a completely positive review from myself. Even fewer get a 10. It takes something of a masterpiece to engross me within a film, and Jerry Maguire is certainly a masterpiece. Right from the start your heart belongs to Tom Cruise as he effortlessly portrays the character change we all secretly yearn to happen to us. Ray is the child we all want, and his mother is the family member we all want to know. A truly amazing piece of cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
It's Complicated,"I read a few reviews both and bad. Bottom line, these kinds of stories are hard to pull off.We all know what's good about this storyline and the actors aren't at fault. The main issue people have with this story is the moral circumstance and the stereotypical responses to this circumstance.This story would not be a story if Dorothy didn't decide to work with him under those conditions. The move was immature and tends to make the audience cynical for her intentions. She claims she was inspired, but really it was about using her and her using Jerry.What I find fascinating is to observe how male/female dynamics can be illustrated, especially in the workplace. Jerry isn't even in control of most of these situations. He's actually a victim of circumstances and simply trying to stay alive, but Dorothy is making all the emotional decisions, being foolish first, as women are, then deciding to be an adult later, like it was 50 Shades. I think flip flopping the character's motivations is what people don't like about this film.When you tell a story and you want the character to change, the story is supposed to change them, but the change cannot be a device to change someone else. That's manipulative. Cameron Crowe is clever in his nuances, but what most people don't buy is how he get's out of them. He used Dorothy like a gypsy to manipulate the audience as well as Jerry to meet the romance part of this light drama. We live in a cynical world is a great line and context for the audience to understand. But Cameron failed to understand because it is cynical it can't really buy into his campy methods of storytelling.People want characters they admire. Dorothy with all her good intentions is nothing more than a manipulator to Jerry and the audience. There are even times in the story where Jerry and the audience like the kid more than her. Why is this? Because deep down we know she's just another single woman who wants back on the Harley with her bad boy which got her there in the first place. It never really addressed her as a character but instead made her a plot device. It's the most distracting part of the story itself.Male/female relationships are complicated today because women have more power. Power isn't a bad thing if used properly. I think that may have been a better story to follow.The rest of the story was great and I agree with some that the business of sports should have been the focal point, not the emotional ploys and sappy lines, but those are simply choices and they either work or they don't. Money Ball was a better film overall because it didn't choose to use devices. It just told a story with a layer of baseball everyone could appreciate.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
My favorite movie of all time,"I don't think Jerry Maguire is the best film of all time, but it's certainly my favorite of all time.  This movie really got me respecting Cruise and his work.  He really gives a top class performance in this movie.  The best part about this movie, however, is Cuba Gooding Jr.'s brilliant, hilarious performance.  He really gets this role down pat.  No body could have done this role better than him.  Zellweger, my favorite actress, is fabulous.  In fact, the whole cast is a marvel.  I also love Cameron Crowe's really witty script.  It is so sharp.  How does it lose to Fargo for best original screenplay?  Don't get me wrong, Fargo was great, but Jerry Maguire was just better.  If only Kenneth Branagh's version of Hamlet wasn't released that year, Jerry Maguire is the best film.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

And Cameron Crowe's magic continues..,"I just watched Jerry Maguire again last night for, like, the tenth time on the cable. The film could still pretty much shook me emotionally. I still remember the first time I had watched it; I had almost cried at the ""You had me at hello"" scene (And I can assure you that I am the kind of guys who don't cry). Last night, the impact of the scene was still there for me, though not as much as it used to be but, hey, I have watched this film more than ten times already.I just can't describe how much I love this movie. Everyone gives a superb performance including Tom Cruise and, yes, you heard me right, Tom Cruise. He should have won an Oscar for the role of Jerry Maguire, period. For me, no offense to Cuba Gooding, I think he is even better than Cuba in the movie. Rene Zellweger couldn't be cuter in the movie, She makes Dorothy the girl of every man's dream. Bonny Hunt also gives believable performance as Dorothy's caring sister. It's a shame that she hasn't had any decent roles ever since.All in all, the biggest kudo should go to Cameron Crowe. This is definitely his best work ever. It may not be as personal as ""Almost famous"" or as raw as ""Say anything"" but it is his best all around movie. Cameron Crowe is one of the best directors of his generation along with Alexander Payne.This film ranks high up there in my all-time list",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Film-making at its very best,"This is a desert island movie: if there was only one piece of cinema I could watch for the rest of my life, Jerry Maguire is it.This is what film-making is all about. A simple, original slant on a classic story. A lively, elegant script. Great combination performances. Wonderful soundtrack. Inspired editing and mellow, warm cinematography.Cameron Crowe is a writer first and foremost, and his script for Jerry Maguire is funny, moving, intelligent and realistic. Chanelled through the capable trio of Zelwegger, Gooding Jr and The Cruiser, he has created perhaps the finest movie of the last 20 years.You will not regret seeing this film, even if you hate the actors.

Corny,Tom Cruise is a terrible actor and the story is flat and dumb.,6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Almost?  I'm not sure.,"It always feels like it's building towards something, and it has it's moments, but it unfortunately goes nowhere but to a sappy, sugary ending and a walk off into the sunset.First of all, Tom Cruise can't convince me of much.  IN ""Born on the 4th of July"", he was good as the naive kid signing up to 'serve his country', but as the jaded veteran who realized the harsh realities and political motivations behind war, he began to wear thin.  Here, he's great as the cocky, successfull agent, but as soon as that job falls through Cruise's performance seems to follow.  He pulls through in moments of anger, but otherwise it's uneven and even at times spooky.Cuba Gooding Jr. does play his role very well.  Renee Zellwegger...well, I know she's a better actress then what we see here.  I think it's the writing that just demands her to play the same stupid emotion in every other scene. Her son, in the movie, is so over-the-top cute that at times you expect a studio audience to start piping in with 'aaaaw's.  This is good or bad, depending on your outlook and cynicism (obviously I have too much of the latter).  The best acting in the film actually comes from those in the much-ridiculed 'divorced women's group' that pops in and out of the movie - those scenes actually come off a little too realistic in a film where the main characters are anything but.This film just takes on too much, doesn't explore enough and tacks on the ending that it knows will make mainstream audiences happy but hardly completes the story.  What it needed was more dialogue.  Too many scenes were just 'this is what happens' and not 'this is how it is going to happen'.  The only scenes that they let hang are those where Cruise and Zellwegger start kissing.  Could have explored more through dialogue, but I guess there were so many themes in the movie there just wasn't enough time.",,Anonymous,Romance
Fun!,"Cameron Crowe's 'Jerry Maguire' is a Fun and Happening film, that has gained cult-status over the years. 'Show Me The Money' echos throughout the film, even when the characters weep in sadness.'Jerry Maguire' is a yet another story, that can be termed as a 'Rags To Riches' kinda satire. Over-here, 'Jerry Maguire', The Hero loses everything, but eventually gets his job right. Failure shatters him, but success enlightens him.Cameron Crowe's Screenplay packs in tremendous characters, each one stands out. His writing is sharp at most places, and the connect with it's hero remains intact. His direction is splendid almost throughout. The only shortcoming, is it's running time. 139 minutes seems a bit too far-fetched. If 15-20 minutes shorter, the flick would have been an ideal 10/10 fare. Nonetheless, Crowe has done his job right.With such tremendous characters in hand, the performances were bound to be memorable. Tom Cruise is superb as 'Jerry Maguire'. He lives his character in each and every frame. Cuba Gooding, Jr. is absolutely legendary in a supporting role. Renée Zellweger is excellent, while Regina King is spontaneous. Beau Bridges, Kelly Preston, Jerry O'Connell, Jay Mohr & Bonnie Hunt lend very good support.On the whole, do check this one out, as it offers entertainment and proficient performances.

Unafraid of being earnest,"Rewatching this movie with my kids reminded me of both this movie's biggest flaws and its greatest attributes. Yes, it is overly earnest (not to mention a bit long)...but it's also unafraid of both that earnestness and the flawed characters who need it. Crowe never shies away from Jerry's clueless desperation or Dorothy's bad decisions or Rod's arrogance. They are front and center for all to see, including each other. So even when the movie tried too hard, I found myself willing to stick through the cliches for the (many) tender moments because of their humanity. This movie believes that authentic relationship can change people, and it makes me want to believe it too.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
They don't make 'em like this anymore,"I've seen Jerry Maguire now at least five times. As Jerry says near the end ""we live in a cynical world."" Director Cameron Crowe has created something that's a believable, hilarious, heartwarming antidote to that cynicism.Tom Cruise gets a lot of accolades for his portrayal of Jerry. Aside from his toothy smile happening just a few too many times, I agree. Cruise is great, and one of the few true movie stars alive today. His character Jerry places loyalty above most any other human virtue. He's responsible, for the most part, if a little grabby when he's drunk. But he means well.It's Renee Z's character, Dorothy, who really works here. As a single mother who, while certainly smart and beautiful, has her romance options somewhat limited by having a small child, Ray, she straddles the line between being a young flesh and blood woman and a young mother.Cameron Crowe's films have a certain magic. They're down to earth while fantastic, grounded in the granular realities of things like sports, or music, but elevated by their human drama. Really, transcended by it.When Dorothy and Jerry go on their first date, and she's running down the walkway to meet him out in the street, and Bruce Springteens song comes up in the background, it's perfection. This is not just some movie trailer moment. This is the moment many of us have experienced - if we're lucky enough - when all of love and life's potential is right in front of you, is unfolding in the here and now.The supporting cast, Cuba Gooding Jr, of course, but Bonnie Hunt, who is just pitch perfect as the concerned older sister, are phenomenal. This is a movie about people, characters, and their stories. Jerry has to satisfy something, he needs a win, in order to see what he has in his life. That the win doesn't matter without someone to share it with. It's the oldest story we have, and the truest.Movies like this used to be made more often. But the cynical world and international box office has changed things - ""small"" movies like this don't get made as much. So it's a rare and special thing, this movie, and it gets better every time I see it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sporty love story,"Amusing comedy drama that alternates between being a mockery of greed in the sports world and romantic comedy.

Not just a sports drama but more a drama about restarting again,"I saw this movie for the first time nearly 9 years ago. I rewatched it few weeks before last Christmas because I didn't remember it at all and when I re-saw it I thought ''Still very good''.Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) is a sports agent that feels like he has the world under his own feet. However this soon changes as he suddenly has a moral ephiphany and all goes bad for him: he is fired from his job, his longtime girlfriend Avery Bishop (Kelly Preston) leaves him and his team loses again. So he decides to change and in doing so he puts on his side Dorothy Boyd (Renè Zellweger), his secretary who was in love with him all the time and have as his only client his most trusted athlete, Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding jr). And this works: Rod accepts his new contract and he becomes finally the champion Jerry always hoped, and despite Jerry separates from Dorothy after a while, they later reconcile and she thinks that her son could have a future in baseball.This movie is very good and mostly for the acting: despite Tom Cruise is mostly famous for action movies like TOP GUN or the MISSION IMPOSSIBLE ones, here gives a very strong performance as a sports agent that restarts his life and succedds, and not surprisingly Cruise was even nominated for an Academy Award for this performance; René Zellweger gives one of her most famous performances as Dorothy Boyd, Maguire's secretary who ends up marrying him; Cuba Gooding jr shines as Rod Tidwell, a young athlete who is very difficult to satisfy (his most famous line ''Show me the Money!'' says it all) but proves to be good at his sport; Kelly Preston as Maguire's girlfriend and Jay Mohr as Bob Sugar give some very good performances in their resumes.In substance, this is more a drama than a romantic comedy and it proves that it's never too late to restart again if you want to improve on your life.

Heart warming movie. Renee Zellweger is so attractive in this movie.,"I finally watched this movie because people talk about this particular line ""You had me at hello."" It all started from this one quote. First, the screenwriter must have done a good job because he or she left this remarkable and timeless one line. The rest of the story line may seem simple and bland, but the writer manages to absorb the audience till the end without uproar.
Second, many characters possess charm. Jerry, an ambitious sports manager, come to realize the importance of love and the way to express it. We all love this kind of story, right? Dorothy, a pure-at-heart but strong single mom and Ray (Gosh, he is so adorable in this movie.) who is the prototype of cuteness make this move upbeat and warm at the same time.
There are some drawbacks as well.
First, the narrative is too simple. Even though it doesn't feel too simple with charms of characters and good lines, how Jerry come to realization is a little bit abrupt.
Second, Tom Cruise's acting is too much. When I see him act, I can tell him he's acting. A whole facial expression, tone, and how he says the line overall say ""Here I go, I am acting right now. See! I'm serious.""It may be personal opinion because I think great acting makes me see the character not the actor.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Very well acted film!,"Perhaps one of the most quoted movies is Jerry Maguire (1996). So is it really worth all the hype? I think so!

That probably is the most popular quote of the whole film, and it's deserving of that title. That is just good heartfelt writing, some may think it's cheesy or overly cliché, but I just think it's her character being honest about her true love for cruise's character. Cuba Gooding Jr. is the actor who won the academy award for his supporting performance, and yes it's true, he is very good here, I'm not totally certain it was worth an Oscar, but it's still good work. The script is pretty well written, it's all centered about tom cruise and his revelation as a person, and the romance between Zellweger and him is all apart of his big change in himself.

"Cruise  Bored Me at ""Hello""","This is an awkward attempt at linking a sports movie with a romance story. It might have worked much better, except the focal point of both stories is, regretfully, Tom Cruise.Cuba Gooding, Jr. plays an athlete who keeps Jerry McGuire (Cruise) as his agent, after some kind of skulduggery by fellow agents costs Jerry all his other clients (not a well-developed sub-plot, by the way). Gooding's fast babbling and shouting sometimes became an earful, but overall it an interesting and likable character. Gooding made ""Show me the money!"" a commonly-quoted sound-bite.This was the first time I saw Rene Zellweger, and her performance as Dorothy was touching and sweet. You feel her growing sadness and frustration at her situation. Like Gooding, she gave us a memorable line: ""You had me at hello."" Johnathon Lipnicki is great as her son, who bonds with Jerry instantly, but is confused by his behavior.Then there's Tom Cruise. As usual, he over-emotes, swings his arms all over the place when he's talking, looks bewildered at everything, and turns in yet another uninspired role. Like so many other movies, strong acting by his co-stars carries the load and Tom just poses for the camera with the same old glazed expression. Unfortunately, he's playing the title character, and as such, should do something beyond reading from cue cards.Without Cruise, the film might have warranted a 7.

A New Record For Cruise,"Continuing my plan to watch every Tom Cruise movie in order, I come to Jerry McGuire (1996)Plot In A Paragraph: When sports agent Jerry Maguire (Cruise) has a moral epiphany and is fired for expressing it, he decides to put his new philosophy to the test as an independent agent with the only athlete who stays with him and a former co worker.In a time when I'm becoming less and less interested in new movies, Jerry Maguire reminds me why I love movies. Cameron Crowe has wrote and directed a really good movie. A movie that is all about its characters, and whose main character spends much of the time desperate and out of luck. Movies like that can be depressing and a tough watch, but Jerry Maguire isn't.It is not without its problems!! It's a tad too long, has too many subplots, we get your standard sports movie cliché scene, and the kid is a little too movie cute too.Cruise (who won the golden globe) holds the full thing together he is literally in every scene. You need to root for the hero in the movie, and you do root for Cruise, who spends more time on the ropes here, than in any other movie.I find Cuba Gooding Jr really annoying here!! He is just so loud!! All he seems to do is yell!! I could not spend more than 5 minutes in a room with his character!! I'm amazed he won the Oscar. Something Crowe is good at, is giving characters with a small amount of screen time, personalities that made them stand out! Regina King is really good at standing out in her small role. Kelly Preston, so adorable in Twins, is so unappealing here and Jay Mohr is perfectly sleazy as a rival sports agent.Jerry McGuire was nominated for 5 Oscars and grossed $153 million at the domestic box office to end the year, the 4th highest grossing movie of 1996.This was Tom Cruise's fifth consecutive 100-million-dollar-plus film, a new record at the time.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Impressive Sports Dramedy,"I really did not think I would like this film - at all in fact. When the movie first came out to rent, my (now ex) boyfriend suggested we watch the film - he told me I would really like this movie. I said ""ok"" so during our dinner date we watched Jerry Maguire (I was reluctant and kinda turned up my nose when the movie first started). Well, by the time the movie ended I was thinking ""Wow! The movie was actually really good!"". Well, I have to say I had to eat my own words about this movie - it's actually worth watching and I did like the movie more than I was ever anticipating - it's not boring.Jerry Maguire is good sports dramedy (comedy-drama). The film might surprise you as it did me.8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
So much more than an entertaining movie,"I just rewatched Jerry Maguire and it made me realize how well this picture has been made. No matter what you think about Tom Cruise - an actor that I really really call great - but his performance here is fantastic and man did he deserve an Academy Award for this. There are so many scenes were he excelled as an actor and I think that the only reason why he didn't get one, was 2-3 scenes, where his performance dropped by an inch (e.g. After being fired and his drunk-scene). But all in all, he was amazing. Rene Zellweger did a great job, of being more than likeable and Cuba Gooding was so over the top, that all of his scenes are fun to watch. The score is top notch and Cameron Crowe did a great job of putting the pieces of the story together. To sum it up, Jerry Maguire is a MUST-WATCH, cause we have a somewhat original and unique story, great performances, a great soundtrack and lines, that have found its way into pop culture.

Show me my money back,"Sports movies are generally horrendous. That said, this movie is right on par with some of the worst. Necessary Roughness comes to mind, and so does Blue Chips. Throw in a hunk, a bombshell, a cute kid, and a dash of comedy, and you've got yourself a Hollywood fumble. This should be no surprise as Tom Cruise is now a veteran of this genre. All the Right Moves, and Days of Thunder echo in my mind. Sure, many people love this movie, for reasons beyond comprehension, but not this sports-fan. I'd rather watch a movie starring Steve Guttenberg as Brooklyn's best kept Streetball secret, with NBA pipe dreams. ""Who's with me, who's with me.""",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

Pretty swell.,"1996 seemed like a weird year at the movies.People could finally laugh at horror movies with SCREAM, American culture's obsession with the end of the world led to INDEPENDENCE DAY and TWISTER's box office success, both FARGO and TRAINSPOTTING caught audiences and critics by surprise, and the whole sector of cinephiles stood together in disgust that a movie like THE ENGLISH PATIENT could win Best Picture.I'm not a sociologist so I'm not sure how that amounts to when defining the cultural zeitgeist of the late 90s. However I will say that if there's any movie that, to me, properly distills what life felt like back then, I'd say it's either JERRY MAGUIRE or FARGO. Since I already saw FARGO, this Scavenger Hunt is dedicated to this instead.Cameron Crowe missteps quite a lot since his heyday as director, but boy did he had a voice. The sensitive, emotionally broken vision he conjures transcends this otherwise melodramatic story into something we can all relate to. Beneath our grin and multi-million dollar facade, we are all still people with emotions and needs. The center of all this is the Space Pope himself Tom Cruise, reverting his TOP GUN swagger into a performance packed with charm and pathos.Whereas FARGO captured the cynical extremes of human choices and how it affects all of us, JERRY MAGUIRE encapsulates a time where we get so fixated on fame and success to mend our lonely lives. And Cameron Crowe reassures us that sometimes, expressing your emotions won't cause the end of the world. Maybe it's okay to settle down and warm up to people once in a while. Even if you're on the hurdle towards your lowest point, all you can depend on is that one person who really cares about you for you.It cannot possibly compare to the extended cut to ALMOST FAMOUS - because almost nothing can - but I was shocked that this still hits in the feels.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Fantastic,"Cameron Crowe is a master at storytelling, he has a way of making us really care about the characters he creates and then when casting those roles the actors who portray those characters makes us really believe and care about the character they are playing.I am not a huge Tom Cruise fan, a few  of his movies have been really good like Born on the Fourth of July and A Few Good Men but ones like Top Gun and Cocktail fell short of the mark.This movie really made him stood out and his role of the arrogant sports agent who turns out to have a heart really pulls at the heart strings. He deserved all the acculations he got for this role as it was his best performance since A Few Good Men.Renee Zellweger was equally fantastic as Dorothy and the look on her face when seeing her screen son hug Jerry was magic. She was the heart and soul of the film and made you really want the best for her character and son.Cuba Gooding Jr gave a wonderful performance as Rod and absolutely deserved the Oscar. Jonathan Lipnicki was brilliant as Ray and Bonnie Hunt as Dorothy's protective sister was another great performance and it was a shame her character didn't have more of a role to do with.This is a must see and one to watch over and over again.",,Anonymous,Romance
Brilliant take on the Hollywood romance genre,"Sweet but not overly sentimental,comical yet at times a real tearjerker, are the only words that describe ''Jerry Maguire''. Not since ''American Beauty'' has a film managed to touch me in such a gentle and profound way. While ''Jerry Maguire'' may be the Hollywood fabrication of real life, the brilliant Cameron Crowe is there to insure that it doesn't fall and squirm in the trash can which is usually the case with Hollywood romances. ''Jerry Maguire'' packs even more heart than Crowe's earlier film ''Say Anything...'' and even more attitude than ''Almost Famous''. It's one movie that won't make you go back to the box-office and demand ''Show me the money''.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Very Touching, Very Funny, Very Good Film","I have to admit that the first time I saw this film, I wasn't too terribly impressed.  I'm not really sure why, cause I've seen it quite a many times since then and I've loved it every time since.  There are so many good things about this film, that you really ought to see this film.  The acting is great, the characters are great, the story is interesting, the film is beautifully directed, the comedy is hilarious, everything is excellent in this film.All the cast members deserve a great deal of respect for their roles.  Tom Cruise and Cuba Gooding Jr. are absolutely fantastic throughout the film! Rene Zellweger, Bonnie Hunt, Regina King, Kelly Preston, Jerry O'Connell, Jay Mohr, Todd Louiso, Jonathan Lipnicki and Beau Bridges all did a great job as well, and I really liked all of their characters a great deal. Needless to say, the acting is top-notch.The comedy in this film is something I really think I ought to mention.  The comedy is so well done throughout the film, there are a number of times where I found myself just cracking up.  Usually it was just the way something was said, or who was saying it.  The humor is most-definitely NOT any type of graphical humor, you aren't going to see any slapstick or gross-out humor in this film, so if that's what you're looking for you might want to look elsewhere.Well, I really think you should do yourself a favor and see this film! Although, be fore-warned, this is a romantic/comedy/drama, so brace yourself.  It's really good though!  Anyhow, I really hope that you do see this film, and hope you enjoy it.

Cameron Crowe does it again,"Cameron Crowe is one of my favorite filmmakers after only three films to his credit as director (he also wrote FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH, which was a little rough around the edges but still good, and THE WILD LIFE, which was a huge mistake).  SAY ANYTHING and SINGLES were classics, and now comes JERRY MAGUIRE, which is the first time he's made a film about people his age or around that.  It manages to avoid being cynical and at the same time avoid being saccharine in its tale of a sports agent named Jerry Maguire who, thanks to a memo(or mission statement) that came from a brief bout of conscience, loses his job and his fiancee, and must not only claw himself back but admit to himself that he did in fact write that memo and really does believe in it.Tom Cruise has spent half of his career coasting, and half of it giving great performances when he works with a real director.  This fits in the latter category.  As the script shows Jerry's growth in small steps, so does Cruise.  It's not until he really has grown and has something to lose (his marriage) that he has a big emotional scene at the end, and this feels earned, rather than cheap, as it does in so many other movies.  And while he is the star here, Cruise doesn't horn in on everyone else, but really plays off of everyone else, and even allows them room to steal the movie.As for the rest, a lot has been said about Cuba Gooding Jr., and among the people who were nominated for Best Supporting Actor, he would get my vote. He also felt honest and was funny and energetic.  And the rest of the cast is good as well.  But the real force, for me, anyway, came from Renee Zellweger.  I think it was Gene Siskel who said he felt the movie might have started out being more about sports, but when Zellweger was cast, it was shifted towards her character more simply because she lights up the screen. Now, from what I've read, I don't think the movie was edited towards her, but she certainly does light up the screen.  She has the two best moments of the movie; when she finds out Jerry's dumped his fiancee, the look on her face is incredible, and I also loved her line to Jerry after his big speech near the end, ""You had me at hello.""  A great moment in a great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Oh and did I forget, Tom Cruise was also incredible in this movie as you know Jerry Maguire. He had a lovely performance, maybe his best performance yet. Renee Zelwegger was also great in it and was really pretty. Now, I don't really think she is that pretty anymore. I also don't like her anymore either.

A Rom-Com That Gets Distracted By The Sports Themes (Or Is It The Other Way Around)?,"Jerry Maguire tries to be two things: a romantic comedy & a sports flick. Instead of successfully combining those genres, it--rather unfortunately--misses the mark pretty badly on both accounts.For a very basic overview, Jerry Maguire tells the story of the titular character (played by Tom Cruise), a sports agent who suddenly has a change of heart and wants to take a more nuanced/personal approach to the craft. He is, of course, immediately fired from his agency and the only ones sticking by him are office worker Dorothy (Renee Zellweger) and NFL wide receiver Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr.). Jerry's romantic entanglement with the former and stress of keeping the latter happy comprise the bulk of the movie.The film definitely has some iconic moments: Cruise's ""show me the money!"" and ""help me help you!"" outbursts are legendary, and Zellweger is in peak form as ""single mom looking for love again"". Jonathan Lipnicki (playing Dorothy's son Ray) may also be the cutest child actor ever put in front of a camera.Sadly, none of those moments or character beats add up to anything in this flick. Jerry Maguire tries to be a rom-com, but keeps getting distracted by that pesky ""sports stuff"". As such, viewers don't see nearly enough Jerry/Dorothy/Ray interactions to really become invested. Jerry Maguire also tries to be a thoughtful sports movie about agents, but Cruise's character turn is so quick and un-earned that it all comes off a little ridiculous. There is not one reason for Tidwell to stay with Maguire, yet that relationship comprises much of the experience here. Truth be told, the most emotion I got from this entire picture was Tidwell's interactions with wife Marcee (Regina King).My guess is that Jerry Maguire played a lot better in '96 than it holds up to a first-time 2022 viewing. In it's time, Cruise/Zellweger were mega-icons and the concept of ballooning sports egos/contracts was far more controversial as opposed to its acceptance today. But overall I found myself more disappointed than anything--disappointed that writer/director Cameron Crowe couldn't put together a more cohesive product over its 2:19 runtime.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Excellent film.  What films should be about!,"Cameron Crowe's ""Jerry Maguire"" is my favourite film of all time.  It such a great character driven movie with great writing, acting and directing.  I have wrote a little bit about why it's my favorite film ever. Enjoy...Jerry MaguireCameron Crowe's `Jerry Maguire' is my favourite film and when I ask myself why I love it so much, I always come back to the same points:1. Jerry Maguire is a good-hearted decent guy. 2. `Jerry Maguire' is film based purely on story, acting, writing and directing. 3. The film has heart and this movie is what movies should be about.1. One of the reasons is that Jerry Maguire is good-hearted decent guy. I have been thinking about why we should find this so amazing to see a good, decent guy.  I think it's because there is so few of them out there.  Jerry is a hard working guy who is taking the bad with the good.  He is trying to take his one client, Rod Tidwall and get his career back after being fired from his job at SMI.  At no point does Jerry give up.  There are many times when he had come close because he knew he was over.  But he didn't.  He fought and fought and in the end he succeeded.Jerry makes mistakes like we all do.  He messes up from time to time.  He's human.  It's these little touches that make us love the character Jerry Maguire and be able to relate to him.  Even if we have never been through what he has, we can still see his motivations for his actions and understand why he does what he does.Jerry Maguire's biggest problem is not being able to commit to a woman. He's great at friendships but bad at relationships.  At the end of the movie when Jerry has success he realises that it's not all perfect because he cannot share it with the woman he loves.  Only after his hard work and he has now got success does he realise that he needs to have someone in his life to share his life with.When Jerry worked at SMI he was just, as Jerry says, `another shark in a suit', he was all about money.  He had a job; good money and he didn't really need to commit.  But Jerry's journey throughout the movie has made Jerry grow as a person and made him realise a few things.2. The movie is based purely on story, acting, writing and directing.  This movie doesn't rely on big explosions or effects to make this movie fun or interesting. All this movie has is a great script, actors and a great director.I love, just like everyone else, now and again to go along and see a big Hollywood blockbuster full of guns, explosions and guys taking out entire army's with only a handgun.  Those movies are important because they allow you just to relax for a few hours and let your imagination go wild.  But these movies are not satisfying full-hearted movies like `Jerry Maguire'. Those movies do not have the heart and soul that `Jerry Maguire' has.Tom Cruise acts with such comic skill and is so natural.  He is so relaxed and confident in this role and it's obvious he is having lots of fun. Cruise gives a great heart-felt performance, which is one of the best of his career to date. Child actor Jonathan Lipnicki holds the screen with Cruise extremely well and it's a delight to see them share a scene together.  Renee Zellweger gives a fantastic performance as always delivering the lines with passion.The direction from Cameron Crowe is nothing short of amazing.  The atmosphere that the film has is so relaxed, funny and enjoyable.  He uses simple set ups to shoot the movie which works extremely well because there is no fancy shots which make you think `Wow look at that shot'.  He shoots it so subtly that at no point does it ever distract you from the story.3. The film has heart and this movie is what movies should be about.  It is clear that Cameron Crowe made this movie with passion and a real story to tell.  These kinds of movies do not come along very often.  This movie is the kind of movie that could have been made on a much lower budget and still have succeeded because the movie has heart.  It has a story to tell.  As I have said before, I like to see action movies now and again too, but movies like `Jerry Maguire' are what you call real movies.  The film industry today is treated too much like a business and too many filmmakers make movies for money and not because they have a passion for it.Cameron Crowe thank you so much for this film!Ciaobox2k@hotmail.com",,Anonymous,Romance
Excellent Movie,"This movie seems to have all of the necessary ingredients for a blockbuster. No wonder it was so well liked.1. The basic setting itself, that of sports agency, is exciting -- a cross-section of high-stakes business and professional sports.2. The basic plot is compelling: a David-Goliah story, with the sincere David (Jerry McGuire) going up against the Goliaths of the sports agency industry. So many Hollywood films have scored using this formula.3. Lots of fun, clever, snappy dialogue, with the highlights: ""Show me the Money"", ""The Kwan"", ""You had me at hello..."" 4. There are so many well-written scenes, such as the frantic telephone chase, or the bathroom confrontation between Jerry and Rod. And there are so many ""big scenes"" throughout.5. Character development: so many of the characters, such as Jerry, Rod, and Dorothy, have real characters. But the minor characters, such as the Nanny, are also very engaging.6. The acting: all of the actors really sink their teeth into their roles, and come up with highly watchable performances.All combine to make this a very, very entertaining movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

One of my favorite movies ever,"Jerry Maguire is one of my personal favorite films. Cameron Crowe's wonderful script and direction is full of nuances and subtleties that reward repeat viewings, and indeed gets better with each viewing.Each scene of Jerry Maguire is so ""perfect"" that it looks like  Cameron Crowe went to the kinds of lengths Stanley Kubrick did on that other Tom Cruise vehicle, the (awful) film Eyes Wide Shut. Of course Crowe did not try to achieve that kind of perfectionism, which leads me to believe his vision and talent were just so strong that he did not need to--he achieved as close to ""perfection"" as possible anyway.Never has a role been more suited to Tom Cruise. And one realizes just how good Renee Zelwegger is when viewing her other performances (which are so utterly different from Dorothy Boyd), and seeing how she truly inhabits the character (I was convinced that Renee Z. was not ""acting"" and simply ""was"" a Dorothy Boyd-like character until I saw her other (mostly bitchy) prior roles).I cannot give enough praise to Cameron Crowe's script. Jerry Maguire is such a true-to-life, three-dimensional character. I love that he does not always say the right thing. I have always found it slightly annoying that in big dramatic scenes, the main character always has the ""perfect"" line, retort, etc., whereas in real life we all know this rarely if ever happens. I love that Cameron did not give Jerry all the perfect dialogue--he fumbles and babbles, which for me kept him quite believable. (Until his ""You complete me"" line anyway.) God knows if this film had been written by the typical big-budget Hollywood ""team"" of writers, there would be no truly memorable lines like ""you complete me"" and ""show me the money"".I love the Dicky Fox scenes dispersed throughout the main storyline. I wish the DVD version had indexed those scenes, because they are priceless.The supporting cast is wonderful. Regina King is perfect (as always). Bonny Hunt as the older sister Laurel is delightful. Kelly Preston and Jay Mohr are brilliant and pitch perfect. And Cuba got an Oscar so nuff said there.This is that rare Hollywood film with a unique artistic voice, and I greatly look forward to the next Cameron Crowe film.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES I'VE EVER SEEN!,"Having seen this. I can honestly say it has certainly been my misfortune getting to see this stale movie. I say `stale' because the movie itself doesn't teach us anything at all. What do we learn about this movie after its ending? Do we learn that love for a `ridiculous football game' is everything in life? This movie is centered on a football game, which makes most people who like this movie fool themselves and enjoy Mr. Cruise's and Cuba Gooding's failed performances without realizing how bad and shallow they are. The plot of this movie is certainly flawed because of the uninteresting language used throughout the movie and lack of qualities to make us enjoy this. The people who don't like it, including myself lose interest after it begins; the story is so uninteresting and simple, since it's only about a football game and a love story, which make us uncomfortable every minute in the course of this movie.Cameron Crowe did his best to bring us one of the most ridiculous and over-rated movies ever made. I'm not ashamed to say that ""Jerry Maguire"" is one the worst movies I have ever seen. I know what I say. I have seen lots of bad movies. No offense, but if I think carefully I'd be pretty sure it's probably worse, since it's extremely over-rated and unpleasantly acted. One of the reasons why it's that way, is that many reviewers surprisingly gave it a good score and the Academy had the nerve to give it about 5 Oscar nominations, unfortunately including both best performance by an actor in a leading role and best performance by an actor in a supporting role. Added to that, best screenplay, best picture, etc (I don't want to remember all the nominations it received, since it makes me sick) how could the Academy give an Oscar to Cuba Gooding for best supporting actor? Could they not see how shallow and overdramatic it was? He thinks he's an excellent actor and that his performance in this mess was fascinating, but it wasn't at all. It seemed to me that he overacted too much, whenever he cried, he did it in a so fictitious way, that instead of making me feel what his character was supposed to feel, he made me laugh at his `supposed' wistful feelings, which obviously he didn't make moving at all. If you want to see an amazing and moving performance, watch Martin Donovan's performance in `The Portrait of a Lady', who should have won the academy award for best supporting actor in 1996, but sadly he didn't even get a nomination. He portrays the main character's sickly cousin and he does it amazingly, look at his facial expressions, the way he coughed truly made me think he was dying. I don't understand why the Academy couldn't see his riveting performance and instead of seeing it, gave a nod to Cuba's failed performance, who felt the king of the world when he won it. Perhaps he thought that showing himself naked in `Jerry Maguire' could give him the coveted statuette, painfully he was right! Anyway I don't dislike him, I'm just saying that his performance in this movie wasn't that great to be an academy award winner. He gave a better performance in `Men of Honor'; I'd have enjoyed seeing him win an Oscar for this performance instead of wining it in this mess of movie.What a shame! It's the worst best picture nominee ever! At least other very bad movies I've seen, haven't been nominated for best movie, which makes me a little bit glad. Anyway my concern is how it could receive about 6 nods for academy awards. There were amazing movies in 1996 like `The Portrait of a Lady' and `The Crucible', which should have been nominated for best picture, but they grievously didn't. How could this? At least they both received two Oscar nominations, which are something to be proud of, no nominations would be worse. I always ask myself: How could The Academy think that this ridiculous and sappy movie could have been better than `The Portrait of a Lady' released in the same year? How could Jane Campion's masterpiece be under-rated? How could it get academy award nominations for best screenplay and best picture? The plot of Jerry Maguire is horribly made and not recommendable at all. This is not what movies should be like! This movie should have shown a subtle or a different dialogue, which would have made it worth watching, but the dialogue in this movie is boring, bothersome, slow, pretentious, isn't it?? The whole movie was about Jerry Maguire's lovers and an uninteresting football game. Every character in this movie is so annoying because they only talk about this game. Seriously all they do is to talk about this.Let's analyze Mr. Cruise's performance, if you see it closely, you'll find out that he gives a very disappointing performance, since he doesn't care what the viewers think of him, look at his expressions, he thinks he's interesting and funny, but he isn't, instead he's annoying and his shallow performance is totally obvious. No offense, but he needs to be taught by his beautiful ex wife Nicole Kidman who gave a pitch perfect emotionally devastating performance in `The portrait of a lady' as well as her magnificent co-star Barbara Hershey. He doesn't really make his performance plausible because every word he says in this movie seems to be a lie, it seems like he memorized the whole script without thinking about the deepness of his character. For instance we see that he tries to help Gooding's character, but he helps him without feeling the character himself. He only talks to everybody without interest and the deepness that his character probably requires. I don't have anything against Mr. Cruise; however I don't think it's one of his best performances to date. I'm sure he was better in `Magnolia', which also earned him an Oscar nomination and a golden globe. I was just shocked to see him getting an Oscar nomination for best actor in a leading role for this movie. I have seen some of Tom Cruise's movies and I think some of them are fairly good; nevertheless, they weren't as horrible as this one. I think Tom Cruise is a good actor, but as a leading actor in this movie, Mr. Cruise leaves too much to be desired!I don't really like comedy romantic movies like this one. It only shows how a man quits his job and falls in love. This plot makes me consider it so romantic, pointless, sappy and extremely ridiculous; All the scenes in `Jerry Maguire' aren't worth watching, they only show love for an insipid football game and love for uninteresting people like Renne Zellweger who hopefully gave a better performance in `Bridget Jones's Diary'. She thinks she's so tender and sweet in this movie, probably she is in real life, but to me her character in this movie only makes me somewhat upset, because it is annoying since she's only led by Jerry Maguire to carry out a gushy love story. It's very sad that it got so many accolades. The accolades that many interesting and under-rated movies should have got in 1996.It's worth watching if you like mediocre, romantic and comedy movies. I bet you'll not regret it. Otherwise don't watch it, because it's highly unlike you'll enjoy it.Overall, TWO THUMBS DOWN!! This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It has truly been simple, uninteresting and gushy. I respect Cameron Crowe as a director, I know he's a distinguished filmmaker, but I have to say that `Almost Famous' and `Jerry Maguire' are indeed over-rated and so pointless that don't make me excited about seeing his further movies.It's a sorrow that many people loved it. You should try seeing powerful and interesting stories that do teach us something for our lives, not like `Jerry Maguire' that fooled lots of people and especially the Academy with its fake charming, didn't it? I hope nobody is offended by the possible objectionable content of my review. I just needed to say what I felt about this horrible movie; by the way I'm rather glad I'm not the only one who thinks this is a horrible romantic movie, some of my friends disliked it as much as I did, and I could see why. 2/10",,Anonymous,Romance
Schmaltzy but works...extremely well,"Schmaltzy but works...extremely well.A highly successful sports agent, Jerry Maquire (played by Tom Cruise), starts to realise how cynical and superficial his job and industry are. In a moment of inspiration he drafts a manifesto, noting what is wrong with the industry and how it should change. For his forthrightness he is fired. All he has left is one client, Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr), and his new agency only has one other employee - a former colleague, Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellweger).The movie that propelled writer-director Cameron Crowe into the cinematic big league. The first movie he directed, Say Anything..., was great but low-key. Jerry Maguire, his third movie, was even better and was a big deal.Emotionally manipulative but very enjoyable movie. Nice, feel-good, underdog story with heart. Quite funny too, at times. Fairly profound too - some good comments on the superficiality and cynicism of modern sport, business and society.Tom Cruise is in fine form as Jerry Maguire. He plays his ideal role - charming, dynamic and heroic. He got a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his performance.However, the performance that glues everything together, grounds the movie and prevents it from being too syrupy, plus provides the most entertainment, is that of Cuba Gooding Jr. Great work on his part - over-the-top and funny. He deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar.Good work too from Renee Zellweger and Jonathan Lipnicki (as her child).Excellent soundtrack too, as you would expect from Cameron Crowe, him having been a Rolling Stone music reporter in the 1970s.Great entertainment.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Corny, contrived, shrill.","This movie is about two guys, both of whom are on the fringes of their respective professions, neither of whom are particularly liked, both of whom who are angry and disillusioned, who transcend their racial differences to form a bond of friendship. This movie strives to achieve greatness, and fails. If it wasn't for Tom Cruise, this movie would have been entirely unwatchable. Just another pretentious movie.Ever watch a movie the first time and like it, then, some time later, watch the same movie a second time, and not like it? Well if that's happened to you, then you will understand where I'm coming from. After watching this movie the first time, I was really impressed with the story and with the acting, and overlooked some major annoyances in the story. But while watching this movie a second time, the annoyances and contrivances were so glaring that they could not be ignored. The relationship between Jerry and his co-worker ... no, his secretary ... no, his girlfriend ... no, his partner ... or whatever, was so awful that it made me cringe in embarrassment; nor was the girlfriend particularly attractive or smart. What was worse was the girlfriend's son, whose role was played by an actor who has to be one of the most bizarre-looking and bizarre-acting child actors ever in the history of Hollywood. This kid made Spanky and Alfalfa seem as normal as apple pie. Then there was Jerry Maguire himself. Who in their right mind would want to have anything to do with a loser like Jerry Maguire? Yet the director apparently wants the audience to believe that Jerry is really a good guy, even after getting punched on the nose and kicked in the stomach by his fiancé, who couldn't take Jerry's erratic behavior anymore. Not exactly the stuff for an entertaining movie. The one character I did like in the this movie, however, was Jerry's one and only client, an angry football player who, unlike Jerry, had reason to be angry and who demands that Jerry get his act together, do his job and show him the money. Yet the relationship between Jerry and his client is so contorted, contrived and improbable that even allowing for literary license, it's hard to buy (get the pun?), even for a movie. After watching this movie for a second time, my advice for any would-be professional athlete is to avoid a Jerry Maguire and represent yourself instead --- you'll get a better deal.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Touchdown!!,"Jerry Maguire is one of my favorite movies of all time. This movie stars Tom Cruise, Renee Zellwegger, and Cuba Gooding Jr in one of their best performances on screen. Jerry Maguire is about a sports agent who one night realizes that he is ashamed of his life, and types a mission statement about the future of the company he works for. That mission statement gets him fired, and changes his life forever. Dorothy Boyd is a single mother, who is an accountant for the company. When Jerry gets fired, she leaves the job with him. After Jerry gets fired, he is only left with one client. This clients name is Ron Tidwell. Dorothy and Ron make Jerry a better person. This movie provided many touching moments, and had a lot of laughs. This movie basically kicked off Zellwegger's career, and it is a movie which in my book is a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Everybody loved him... Everybody disappeared,"Love...irony...lust...loyalty...trust...all taglines of life, that is, if you're Jerry Maguire. This beautifully written and directed movie is & always will be my favorite movie. It took viewers on a roller coaster ride of emotional wave after another and right back around. The message in this movie was very touching and worth a minute or two of thought. The movie not only relayed a message through the dialect and content, but on a more personal level where you could relate in one-way or another, no matter what age.Whether you're an athlete striving for excellence, single mother trying to get ahead in life, the child of that mother, or even a sports agent, this romantic and funny drama is a movie to be treasured. I definitely recommend, if you liked this movie, that you see 'A Walk in the Clouds' with Keanu Reeves. Both movies tie together life lessons and the main message that we should just step down from our podiums over-looking our lives and see the true meaning and value of life...because ""the journey is everything""...",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The masterpiece,The movie JERRY MAGUIRE which i cant say a movie but life is a an excellent work. When i watch it i feel like i live it. This masterpiece changed my life as it caused me to be successive in life as Jerry Maguire did. Today maybe i couldn't be successive in life and wouldn't have had a job but i did by modelling Jerry guy. I owe much to this movie. I've seen it 7 times in cinema and bought its CD when there were no DVD's at those times the movie relased. The movie is life's itself. So there is nothing i can say more.

Boring love story = true nature of the movie,"You expect a punchy, cynical movie about sports and a behind the scenes look at a sports agent job through Jerry Maguire, and ultimately you end up enduring an extremely conventional and corny rom-com.This love story occupies a huge place in the script and you wonder why because it is boring to death and so melodramatic that it becomes cringe-worthy.The part related to sports is almost anecdotal, overshadowed by this boring love plot, and it's quite difficult to understand why Cameron Crowe didn't chose to focus on football since it augured good things especially thanks to Rod, the exuberant Cardinals wide receiver, embodied by the excellent Cuba Gooding Jr., only satisfaction of this insipid and overly long movie.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

He did deserve his Oscar and all the success he has been having.This has a beautiful mix of drama, romance and comedy. A must see. My grade: A-",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Tom Cruise shows why he is the biggest star on the planet,"Jerry Maguire is a great film. Tom Cruise is magical in the lead role and Crowe, who doesn't have a subpar entry on his short resume, has crafted another winner here. In fact, with its attention to detail, top-notch performances, and universal themes, Jerry Maguire marks his most successful movie to date. The film is basically about a successful sports agent who has a crisis of consciousness as the movie begins. He pens a moving memo but is fired by the seniors because of it, which leads him to start his own sports agency with just one star- a not so great throwback played sumptuously by Cuba Gooding Jr. For anyone who has forgotten the feelings that a wonderful movie can trigger, Jerry Maguire provides a welcome reminder.

An absolute must-see.,"Jerry Maguire(Tom Cruise) is a talented sports agent who has a breakthrough one night in a hotel one night. The idea Jerry wanted to get across was ""Fewer clients, Less money"". He gave the 25 page mission statement out the every worker at SMI where he worked, eventually getting him fired and replaced by his friend Bob Sugar(Jay Mohr) who takes almost every client from Jerry behind his back. After causing a large scene in the office, Jerry offers the idea that anyone can come with him and start a new company. Dorothy Boyd(Renee Zellweger), an acquaintance who admire Jerry very much, was the only one who went with him.After the scene, Jerry's two clients were narrowed down to one and his fiancé(Kelly Preston) left him because he was a ""loser"". Jerry must take his one client, Rod Tidwell(Cuba Gooding Jr.), to the top, finding love with Dorothy on the way.Cameron Crowe does a remarkable job and the movie touches anyone that watches it. The acting is incredible but I don't just mean Tom Cruise. The supporting cast is the best that I have ever seen. Renee Zellweger was great and Cuba Gooding Jr. was made for the role as the bickering, unsatisfied, Rod Tidwell. The writing in the movie was brilliant and included some very well known movie quotes such as: ""Show me the money"", ""Help me, Help you"", and ""Shut up, you had me at hello"".

"Despite the mix of many genres, this is a well-balanced movie","Jerry Maguire is a sports agent and in a certain way a very typical manager. He thinks, lives and acts fast, he's a popular guy who earns buckets full of money and has everything except a conscience. But than on one night he gets an epiphany. Money is no longer the most important thing when doing business... He writes it all down, gives his text to all his colleagues and bosses and gets almost immediately fired for it. He decides to start as an independent and all a sudden no one seems to like him anymore except for two people. A young football player and a female accountant. Together with them, he'll try to prove the rest that he is right and that the others are wrong, that he's still a very good agent, that he still has a nose for talent,...This movie is a mix of several genres: drama, comedy, feel-good movie and romance, but somehow seems to be able to keep everything well balanced. I'm not familiar with Cameron Crowe's work, but this movie certainly makes me want to see more of it. Of course the director isn't the only one that makes a movie work.

An immensely likable movie.  (POSSIBLE SPOILERS),"The reason this film succeeds despite initially appearing to have a poor premise is its fantastic writing. The characters at once seem like real people we can identify with, but not so mundanely 'real' that they forget to say something funny now and again. The dialogue is by and large NOT full of banal observations about the economic state of the sports industry, because Crowe wisely realises that the crowd who go to see romantic comedies will most likely not care about that aspect. What they WILL care about is mostly sympathetic characters, a believable central romance and an ounce of chemistry between the two leads. Crowe and his performers ensure that they get all that, and at times unexpectedly more too...The film does occasionally lapse into sentimentality with the whole 'play with your heart, not for the paycheck' thing, but this is offset nicely by the charm of the leading players and Maguire's acknowledgement at the beginning that his 'rebirth' will sound ""somewhat 'touchy-feely'..."" The supporting characters are all so skillfully drawn too, that even if the central relationship doesn't quite work for you, you're sure to find something of interest in the more minor characters. A particular standout here is Jay Mohr as the slimy agent ""Bob Sugar"". He shows real talent here and it's a great surprise (possibly down to poor script choices) to see that he's still woefully underused by Hollywood.Whilst Cuba Gooding Jr is fine here, I still cannot believe he won an Oscar for his performance, as he doesn't come anywhere near matching the other talent on show. I'm not saying that Cruise should have won an Oscar, but I could have understood that a whole lot more...Great soundtrack too. You can tell as much care has gone into the composition of that as has the rest of the movie. A rare thing in today's market, that's filled with horrendous ""Music inspired by.."" rip-offs.(At the time of writing... ) this is STILL the only Cameron Crowe film I've seen. Judging by the mostly glowing reviews heaped upon his other works, it seems safe to say that Jerry Maguire isn't merely a lucky one-off for this director.

Great movie with an exciting story and well thought humor,"You can tell after watching Jerry Maguire that this movie isn't in it for just some quick money. The movie has a lot of heart and a great sense of humor to back it up. The story is simple enough, a sports agent loses his job and is desperately trying to keep his head above water in the sports business. He falls in love along the way and it turns into a love story. This movie has a great cast including a Tom Cruise who is wonderful in it. Cruise straddles the line between desperate and crazy with Jerry Maguire and in the process delivers some hilarious scenes (SHOW ME THE MONEY). Cuba Gooding Jr. is strong throughout (as he and Maguire are almost equals in their life situation). The film manages to not go to melodramatic and keep the comedy coming. For me, the whole movie is made by Tom Cruise. In particular, I find his reactions hilarious. The firing sequence along with his facial expressions when answering the devastating phone-call in Cushman's apartment are prime examples of Cruise's greatness in this movie.

The plot was decent in the beginning, but got boring and weird as the movie went on with all the pointless and uncomfortable love scenes. The plot wasn't very intriguing either and made me want to stop watching halfway through.

Better than many might expect,"In the 90's Tommy Cruise has been the undisputed box-office master, having managed the feat of starring in Five straight $100 million grossing movies (Days of Thunder, A Few Good Men, The Firm, Mission Impossible, Jerry Maguire). He can do no wrong, and Cameron Crowe manages to get another superb performance from him, in what is essentially a romantic drama.The film, while relying on a dialogue heavy script, is really about triumph in the face of adversity. This is portrayed through Maguire who at one moment has it all, then the next minute has nothing, and so has to go it alone with one sole client. The Gooding character also faces a very personal battle, trying to salvage a career that is seemingly on a downward spiral. Ultimately, this is a feel good movie, which while clearly aimed at the female audience, is still an extremely professional production that a lot of men probably enjoyed but were frightened to admit it. Gooding thoroughly deserved his Oscar, and the highlight of the movie is still the ""Show me the money"" scene. Cameron Crowe is a director/writer to look out for in the future.7/10.",,Anonymous,Romance
"""Show Me The Money!""","Jerry Maguire, I'll be honest, this is a film that is quite unique as it does not remind me of anything I've seen and that is a special thing In Film. Tom Cruise steps into the role of Jerry Maguire, a well respected Sports agent who tries to get back on his feet after being fired from his job. However, the only client he has is Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr.) A disgruntled football player who wants a better contract. This is an amazing experience to catch, I'm a massive fan of cruise, in my opinion he has yet to release a bad film, I love it all.What I enjoyed about this was, not just the plot but how invested Cruise became within his role of Jerry, some very strong scenes of pure emotion, what a class act.Really enjoyed this I'd highly recommend!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Why you should see this film - JR,"This is Tom Cruise's best performance to date because you actually love the character. He has given McGuire such a warmth and pitiful soul that you can't help but root for him in everything he does and what he stands for. The script is phenomenal and takes you through the film without even considering the film itself...before you know it the film has finished and you are left breathless and emotional. The acting is also very good and Cuba Gooding Jnr is such a driving force and I believe this is one of the greatest acting collaborations ever seen. Over the top? See the film and find out for yourself. You will laugh, cry and consider your own view of the world and how you can change it for the better. One of the best films of the decade.

"Romance is fine, but since it's the 90's, let's get rid of the racial stereotypes.","I was almost unable to follow the plot of the film, due to the ridiculous court jester-type character played by Cuba Gooding, Jr.  He was the only significant minority character in the film, whose purpose I completely missed, because I was distracted by the singing, dancing, and obnoxious behavior that has been stereotypical for black americans in film and theatre since the genre's very existance.  Not to mention, the film housed yet another case of the sports world being one of the only avenues to black success.  In many cases, some of the world makes general assesments of minorities through film because they don't take the time or feel it is necesssary to learn much about others through personal contact, if they aren't forced to.Personally, I feel a film like Jerry McGuire with such stereotypical undertones, adds on to those second and third hand assessments.

Jerry Maguire spawned several popular quotations, including ""Show me the money!"", ""You complete me"", ""Help me help you"", and ""You had me at 'hello'"". These lines are largely attributed to Cameron Crowe.The great thing about Jerry Maguire will be unique to each viewer, is it the trust bond between Jerry (Tom Cruise) and Rod (Cuba Gooding Jr.) or the love between Rod and Marcee (Regina King) or the romantic story between Jerry and Dorothy (Renée Zellweger). Whatever it is that you like, the movie is full of it.The plot, Jerry is a sports agent who developed a moral epiphany one night; he decided to write it all down. Still in the drive he went ahead printed it and sent it to all members of his staff. He got fired for expressing it; he decides to put his philosophy to the test as an independent.He tried all his best to keep his clients but only one stayed with him, Rod Tidwell an ego maniac, it all seems rosy at first and then it all went downhill for Jerry.He then realized what mattered most in life.Before Jerry Maguire Cuba was known for his movie Boyz n the Hood where he played Tre, he also was in a few good men with Tom Cruise. Cruise however was coming from a breakthrough role in his movie Mission Impossible, to star in this one.After Jerry both actors have grown to be a well-known name in the movie industry with Tom sticking to the high rollers and Cuba staying with direct to DVD releases from 2009 – 2011.This movie is a most see, so don't chicken out go see it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Jerry Maguire (1996) - Show Me the Money!,"Cameron Crowe creates a story about one man, and his daily struggle as an agent in the sports management, and how life can change everything later on.

Tom Cruise makes the performance of a lifetime as Jerry Maguire, where he uses all of his energy and drama, and bring into one excellent role. But not just Cruise, other great cast members including Renee Zellweger, Regina King, Bonnie Hunt, Kelly Preston, and the hilarious Cuba Gooding, Jr. were all brilliant and unique.

Two different movies...,"This movie basically has two different parts to it : the part at the beginning depicts Jerry Maquire as a low-life sports agent who will do anything to make money with his clients. The second half shows how he puts his life back together through a deep and enlightening relationship, after being fired. The problem is that the earlier part with him being the slimy sports agent is more interesting than the romance ! ...and that's a very big criticism considering the theme of this movie !I would rather see more of Jerry Maguire as that slimy sports agent. That was the entertaining part of the movie (besides Cuba Gooding Jr., who is very entertaining in his role). The romance is just stale here.

Sadly the film hasn't aged well,"It's getting close to 30 years since Jerry Maguire hit the screen and a lot has changed; the internet and social media have now replaced any attempt at the personal service that JM idealistically tried to portray as a change in the sports agency industry. In fact, it only attracted more materialistic, status seeking MBA's looking to be more like Scott Boras than Jerry Maguire.Predictably, athletes and agents now command and control even more of the sports scene than they ever did. Players' agents demand longer and more expensive contracts, with owners often refusing to invest and top name athletes from fans' favorite teams moving on to a bigger paycheck in other parts of the country or world.In more recent developments, college athletes are now allowed agents to negotiate NIL contracts with sponsors. That of course, is if the athlete isn't already convinced by his agent to forego his college eligibility to a lucrative contract before reaching sophomore status. Transfer portals have also allowed collegians to move between schools more easily based on athletic skill only, seeking a higher commercial value profile.Cameron Crowe's film was well intentioned as a feel good saga of loyalty and friendship over money. But it was rather naive. Not his fault and it's a still a good film carried entirely by the characters and the actors who played them. It was a nice try.",,Anonymous,Romance

So good that it destroyed careers,"I just saw Jerry Maguire again for the first time since I saw it on the big screen back in 96.  What a great flick!  It was even better than I remembered it.  What struck me was how great the three leads were: Cruise, Gooding, and Zellweger.  Cruise has history.  There was no way that he'd be defined by Maguire, but the other two were more newcomers -- at least to me. I can remember saying: watch Gooding and Zellweger, they're going places! But they never did.  Not on to level I expected.  Is it possible that Jerry Maguire set the bar so high for these two young actors that they could never again meet the audience's expectations?This seems to be a problem for Zellweger in particular.  I thought Nurse Betty was a fine movie.  Bridget Jones less so.  But they were both disappointing because Zellweger could not raise her performance to the level she did in Jerry Maguire.  Same story with Cuba Gooding.

I was watching this stupid movie with Zac Effron called ""That Awkward Moment"". Really horrible but in the movie the main characters said Jerry McGuire was one of the best movies of all time. This is clearly Hollywood elite propaganda.The plot makes no sense. Who cares if Ken Griffey Jr catches a TD pass for the worst team in the NFL? Rene Zelwigger was also horrible in this movie. One of the worst phrases of all time came out of this movie. ""You complete me."" Makes me want to vomit. Tom Cruise is a horrible actor and has absolutely zero charisma in this role making it impossible to identify with his character.. It's mellow dramatic to the extreme. I want my $6 back.

Affirmation,"This is a movie about the repudiation of cynicism and the affirmation of love.  The fact that this message resonates on both the personal and professional levels for each of the main characters, is testimony to a brilliant script, inspired casting and the commitment of every player to this story.  Tom Cruise's character, Jerry Maguire, had a personal epiphany. He paid a huge price for it....but gained everything back, and more, because of his innate integrity.His character both learned lessons and taught lessons, as did Cuba Gooding's Oscar winning character, Rod Tidwell.  Jerry and Rod needed each other for opposite reasons, and their respective mates (Renee Zellweger and Regina King) played enormous roles in both men's individual awakening to the big picture.  I left the film believing they were such transcendent forces in one anothers' lives that they'd all be friends forever and a day.

Brilliant Cruise transcends film.,"It's enough to make one weep.  The first hour of this film is good fun, an exposure of a certain kind of American bluster, schizophrenically epitomised in Mr. American Bluster himself, Tom Cruise (hard business; 'touchy-feely' ethics).  The second half replaces this with another kind of bluster - cute kid, family values, success, reconciliation, redemption.  With a cute taste of misogyny too - women are either ridiculed divorcees (Crowe gets to mock two American bugbears in one - women and collectives), hard-nosed career, er, ladies (independent!  Sexually liberated!  Careerist!  Help mummy!), sterile wisecrackers, or dippy drips who despite being (presumably highly qualified) accountants in a multi-million dollar company, are dumb enough, despite being single mothers, to give up a well-paying job for a phoney ideal, are prepared to marry a cynical creep AND aren't actually impressive human beings in their own right, juggling family and career, but a kind of spare limb, a foot maybe, lying around, waiting to make Tom Cruise 'complete' - i.e. just another mother.  Same with Rod Tidwell, less a character than a series of amusing bits, whose own rich family life is just a reflection of what Maguire's is not.  His blackness, sponged by Maguier, probably makes the latter's whiteness complete too.This is a shame.  Crowe has never been the most visual of directors - you can see why he worships Billy Wilder - and the second half gets bogged down in dispiritingly trite speeches; but the first half is a pretty good deconstruction of Cruise's persona, brilliantly developed by Paul Thomas Anderson and John Woo in 'Magnolia' and 'Mission Impossible 2'.  All the familiar signifiers are there, presented in the classically flattering stylistic manner - the smile, the perfect hair, the easy beauty, the suits; but mostly the talk, the promises, the hyperactive loghorrhea, hiding a very empty core, a despair visualised by some sequences of dreamlike blue; we can see Maguire slowly break down, swallowed up by his own vacuity.  The 'mission statement' is a typically empty-headed response, a way to order the emptiness of his life, a kind of American dream, a purpose; the very American need to break ruts and drive for something, which is much easier than just changing what's wrong with the rut.Unfortunately, Crowe takes him at his word.  It is possible that the denouement, as with Rod's concussion, is pure fantasy, a fake injection of uplift in what had become a very gloomy film - Jerry's increasing the uppers to blot out some serious downers (and it is reassuringly American and capitalist that heart does actually mean money anyway).  Jerry is like a Western hero, interminably restless, roaming freely over states, but he is also a parasite, a horse dependent on a rider, a man of no active power, hanging on the decisions and betrayals of others.  This is like some kind of metaphor for (American) life, and the heterosexual family unit provides security against it, a fixed abode, a sense of coherent, whole identity and self-worth, a properly defined masculine role.  No thanks.But, although it's hard to take a multi-millionaire egoist telling us to reevaluate our values, Tom Cruise is amazingly good, giving a depth of performance so rare in today's mainstream cinema, awesomely self-aware, revelling in the blurring of star and role.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
show da moola,"It's a good flick, bit of a soap at times, I liked the fact that someone starring for the Arizona Cardinals(!!) is at the center of the flick. That was like using the Expos in Baseball-hey why not?!Cruise is good. He plays his basic tortured Type-A persona Yuppie again, to a T of course. He's engaging.I liked Rene Z though she Does look an awful lot like Jewel-her character is fragile and always afraid of being hurt. It seemed rather odd that they got married so quick, then just as fast looked like they were backpedalling outta it. One gets the idea that it was an ankle deep type marriage and that the 'happy ending' may very well be a transitory one indeed.Guys like O'Connell, Mohr and Beau Bridges turn in some fine cameo-ish appearences.

Lively film experience,"Jerry Maguire is not a perfect creation, I think no one can objectively affirm that Jerry Maguire is the perfect film experience. However it is what I call an event. If I were to completely analyze this title I'm sure I would find a consistent number of misplaced scenes, scenes which shouldn't have been put, in the first place, and which seriously diminished the depth of the subject.The story is hardly new, same scenario in which an apparently ruined agent spectacular rises and take revenge on those who fired him. If you are looking for surprises Jerry Maguire will not match your expectations. But if you want a joyful, funny, vivid film which isn't stupid and trashy at the same time, than Jerry Maguire truly is the perfect choice.Jerry Maguire beautiful played by Tom Cruise, is an agent who has a one in a lifetime, nocturne revelation which ends with memo in which he suggests that agencies should have fewer athletes under contract, so that the agent/athlete relationship would be much closer, more sincere. However, it seems his employers do not appreciate Jerry's altruism and chose to dismiss him rapidly. If you think Jerry Ma-f..king-guire is the guy to back down well you're dead wrong. Instead he immediately decides to get his revenge on the agency, especially on Bob Sugar, his rival. The problem is the only athlete under contract with, it's the mouthy ,always unsatisfied Rod Tidwell... ...I dare to say that the characters are the main attraction of this film. Jerry Maguire, played very well by Tom Cruise is the handsome type, a spontaneous charismatic, character, extremely skilled in his job as a sport agent. Rod Tidwell, though at least as spontaneous as his agent, is no more no less than a flippant, always dissatisfied with the financial aspect, arrogant and recalcitrant black male, just like his wife Marcee, the female version of her husband. Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zelwegger) - sweet and her son Ray (Johnatan Lipnicki) - a simple woman, perhaps too simple which still hasn't found her love, but looks to change this when she accompanies Jerry his attempt to regain his position as the best, most appreciated sport agent.As I said, this title, focuses more on character study rather than on a great scenario, which is, in fact, a regular, linear one. But the way it was illustrated by the director and actors in particular, was really special, making Jerry Maguire one of the most lively film that I have ever seen. I think the defining word for Jerry Maguire is alive, with great significance on dialogs, which were nonetheless sparkling and generous with unique lines like: ""show me the money!""As a conclusion, I state that Jerry Maguire is Overall a good film, very good at times, well worth a **** out of ***** rating (8/10)",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Twizard Rating: 100,"I love movies that can't necessarily be classified by a single genre. Jerry Maguire isn't a chick flick, but it's not a sports film either. Nor is it a traditional comedy. It's possibly all three, but never just one. That's what makes it great. It appeals to both genders equally without alienating either of them.The title character is played by Tom Cruise in one of his best performances. He's a slimy sports agent who, one day, has an epiphany, realizing he no longer wants to sell lies to his clients, but real relationships. The only problem is he doesn't even know how to have a real relationship in his personal life. At work, he sends out a mission statement that lauds the idea of having less clients to improve quality. This sudden life-changing notion wins over the approval of his cohorts, but his high-level agency disapproves and fires him.Starting from the ground up, Jerry has nothing and no one to work with. The only people that follow him are a low-level employee, Dorothy (Renee Zellweger) and Arizona Cardinals wide receiver, Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding, Jr.).The chemistry between Cruise and both of his costars is natural that you can't imagine anyone else in those roles. You see him seamlessly transform over the course of the film, only taking notice of it in the end. Honestly, it's very much reminiscent of Pacino in the Godfather--only backwards.Jerry Maguire equally covers the depth of multiple characters brilliantly. The film not only goes inside the mind of a scuzzbag-turned-nice-guy, but of an athlete. Gooding plays a talented football player with a chip on his shoulder. He's not on his way out of the league, but he's no Jerry Rice either. He's on a middling NFL team and thinks he deserves a bigger paycheck than he gets. He knows he's good, but no one else sees it. The film brings very relatable themes to seemingly unrelatable people. There is more to the movie than demand for money. It's about friendship and knowing what's important in life amidst all the menagerie.Writer-director Cameron Crowe has a knack for storytelling--already evident by his previous work--but he outdoes himself with this one. Nothing is ever truly predictable, which is an impressive accomplishment considering the type of film. Never is there a dull moment, and the dialogue is so effortlessly perfect without ever feeling contrived. The sappy moments are never that, when any other writer would know no other way. It's a rom-com for the ages and may even be the pinpoint for redefining the genre.It has aged so well and is still a great watch to this day. Highly recommended for those of you who haven't seen it and are arguing with your other half about what to watch on movie night. I promise you'll both enjoy it.Twizard Rating: 100",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Even if you don't like sports or Tom Cruise, you have to like this movie. It's a simple plot, but some how the movie turns into an Oscar winner. It's about a sports agent who gets fired from his job and starts out on his own. The only sports athlete that he has left is Cuba Gooding JR(who won best supporting actor). There are also a lot of cry baby moments in the film. The relationship between Jerry and the little kid is priceless. And how about that very funny scene when Cuba wants more money.

Many classic (and I try not to use that word) scenes abound:  Cuba Gooding Jr.'s first phone conversation with Cruise; the entire first date between Cruise and Renee Zellweger; the eight-year old Lipnicki whose precociousness is for once appropriate and not annoying; the climactic football game and the reactions of peripheral characters.

This Movie Got Me With Hello,"Out of all the romantic comedies made in America, that I've seen, this is by far the best. It surprisingly made me laugh almost through the whole movie. One of Tom Cruise's and Cuba Gooding Jr's best and funniest performances. Definitely worth watching.I'd never seen a Renee Zellweger film until this; and if I hadn't seen this I probably wouldn't of ever watched Bridget Jones's Diary one or two, which turned out to be others which I thoroughly enjoyed.Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) is a sports talent agent, with some of the biggest clients that anyone has. Until he writes a mission statement.Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellwegger) is a single mother working at the same office as Jerry.

"""Show me the money!!""","Jerry Maguire is a romantic comedy-drama sports film directed by Cameron Crowe and stars Tom Cruise, Cuba Gooding Jr., Renée Zellweger, and Regina King.A sports agent is left with just one footballer after being fired from his job and the lone footballer is also looking for better rate contract.Cuba Gooding Jr. Had won an Oscar for the film and there is no second thought that he deserved the Oscar for best supporting actor but for me it's Tom Cruise who deserves all the Kudos for his scintillating performance. The director also deserves an applause for making a memorable and great film with a very predictable and simple plot.Screenplay of the film is very gripping and will keep you engaged, despite of being a predictable film the film never looses its grip from the viewers. The film is touchy, emotional and mesmerizing.Acting is superb and apart from Cuba Gooding Jr and Tom Cruise both the female leads were equally impressive with Regina King being little more impressive.Climax of the film was predictable but emotional and gives a good closure to the film.

Now here's true entertainment.,"Jerry Maguire stars Tom Cruise in an academy award nominated performance. And the nomination should have turned out a win for Cruise because he was terrific in this movie. Cruise is Maguire, a sports agent who loses his job. He scrambles to get a client and gets the worser of the possibillities, Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr., in an academy award WINNING performance and rightfully so). Rod makes things more complicated for Jerry, but he motivates Jerry more than he frustrates him. And all through his world of complicity, Jerry Maguire meets a beautiful office worker and her adorable and charming son, and the two fancy a love interest with each other. Lest we forget that world famous saying, ""SHOW ME THE MONEY!!"", which was created in this movie. That's a real funny scene with ""show me the money"" and the whole film overall is great.

"Leaving the fast lane of greed for friendship, love and... loyalty","A quick-talking big-time sports agent (Tom Cruise) has an epiphany and swiftly loses his job with a big sports management corporation, but retains one loyal colleague (Renee Zellweger) and one outrageous NFL client (Cuba Gooding Jr). Can they rise from the ashes? Kelly Preston, Bonnie Hunt and Regina King are also on hand.""Jerry Maguire"" (1996) is equal parts spirited drama, romantic comedy and sports flick. It effectively illustrates how the fast-paced cutthroat world isn't interested in inspiring, well-meaning truth, but that doesn't negate the value of honest friendship, genuine love and, most of all, loyalty.It's all-around 'hip' and entertaining, slowing down for the mid-section. But the last act drives everything home and is moving. It pretty much represents the best of the sometimes dubious genre (romcom).The film runs 2 hours, 19 minutes, and was shot in the Los Angeles area as well as the Phoenix/Tempe region of Arizona, including Lost Dutchman State Park just east of there.GRADE: A-",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Harmless fluff.,"It's hard not to like Jerry Maguire, because it's one of the few romantic comedies that I've seen lately that manages to stay sweet without pushing it and becoming contrived and saccharine.  Tom Cruise tones down the overacting for once, and Renee Zellweger, Cuba Gooding Jr, and Jonathan Lipnicki are all as charming as they come.But that said, the movie is hardly the cinematic masterpiece it's been made out to be.  It certainly has a fair amount of substance in its treatment of the theme of moral growth, but it's nothing to write home about technically, and, while it may be cute, the plot in general is nothing we haven't seen before and doesn't offer any real ingenuity.But it is certainly worth spending a couple of dollars, since it is a particularly good example of its genre and has a genuine feel-good quality.

The feel good movie that just feels great!,"The first time I saw Jerry Maguire in the cinema back in 1996, I thought it was a good film, with some nice performances. But having just watched it again on DVD, I have come to the conclusion that this is a great film.It manages to be funny, touching, and thought-provoking without once entering into the realm of sugary sentimentality. The praise for this must be Cameron Crowe, who has written an excellent script full of nice ideas and great lines. The film is loaded with quotable material (from the ""Show Me The Money"" scene to the beautifully poetic ""You complete me"" speech).Tom Cruise gives what is possibly his best performance, without really trying, while it is easy to see why Jerry falls for Renee Zellweger's Dorothy. Not only stunningly beautiful, but with the sort of personality that any man would fall for. Cuba Gooding Jr is excellent with his larger-than-life Rod, but the one person who seems to be left out throughout the reviews is Bonnie Hunt as Renee's sister. A brilliantly funny performance with a fine line of sarcasm.I don't want to sound too gushing, but this is without a doubt a great chick flick that the guys can appreciate too.

Tom Cruise's Greatest Performance,"Jerry Maguire is what it is because it blends everything it has to begin with, with talented writing and phenomenal performances from Tom Cruise and Cuba Gooding Jr. This story at first is in a way, a satire of American sports. Everything from NFL drafts to player's wages, the film exploits everything in between at the very beginning. At first, Jerry Maguire is Tom Cruise. Literally, this is the same character that Cruise has played in every film since Risky Business. However, you really get to know the character and feel great sympathy for him. He certainly did not deserve everything to happen to him, and you really get a great sense of his peers as well. Is this really what it is, or more like, is this really how it is? Either way this is the best performance of Tom Cruise's career hands-down. Cuba Gooding Jr is the real star of the show. He deserved his best supporting actor Oscar as much as Cruise deserved his best actor. The two work well off each other, and you really anticipate the next time they are on screen together. The film slowly evolves into a love story, not only between Cruise and Renée Zellweger, but the bond between Cruise and Cuba. This is a film that works, every cheesy but quotable line, every chuckle from Cuba Gooding Jr being an outlandish diva and every time you realize that this is a film that is much deeper than what you may have thought.

"Lively script, fine casting","Cameron Crowe's story of a sports agent (Tom Cruise) and a football player that he represents (Cuba Gooding Jr.) who are both struggling and need each other, with their flaws resulting in a stormy relationship. The pair are like mirror images of one another. The agent is all heart when it comes to work, so much so that the 25-page overly altruistic mission statement he feverishly pens gets him fired, resulting in him having only one player left to represent. In his personal life, however, he's detached and somewhat phony, which makes the romance that springs up with his assistant (Renée Zellweger) who idolizes him rather sad. Meanwhile, the player is all heart with his beautiful wife (Regina King), but has a chip on his shoulder and is too calculating in his professional life.This is a film that touches on several genres - comedy, romance, drama, and sports - and it works because of Crowe's lively script and fine casting. There are lots of brilliant moments and quotable lines from the three leads, and each turn wonderful performances, but what I loved just as much were how so many supporting players get their chance to shine. Regina King's response to the unimpressive contract offer, Bonnie Hunt's advice before her sister goes out on a date, and Todd Louiso's protectiveness and obsession with jazz all come to mind (he was the nanny). Even Beau Bridges as the top draft pick's father whose ""word is oak"" makes the most out of his small part and is fantastic. It got a little too tidy towards the end relative to the relationship between Cruise and Zellweger's characters, a resolution I couldn't really buy into, but overall, there's a lot to love here. Bonus points for playing Bob Dylan's 'Shelter From the Storm' while going to the credits too.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Flawed but Irresistible,"It seems that no matter what Tom Cruise touches turns to gold. He's just one of those actors that has such a commanding and irrepressible screen presence that even if a film is otherwise crap, it's still pretty good as long as he's in it. Witness Cocktail!!Jerry Maguire however is nowhere near being that heavy piece of luggage that Cruise alone must carry to bring it salvation. It's a strong ensemble piece with accurate insights into the cynicism of the sports world and the soul searching mission of one man who must break free and live free in order to attain redemption from this world. The plot is about Jerry Maguire (Cruise) who thinks the world is his oyster and thinks that everybody loves him until he gets fired for speaking his mind about the need to start caring for his clients. Cruise loses everything except the feisty, seemingly average wide receiver Tidwell(Gooding Jr.) and a loyal employee Dorothy (Zellwegger)who embraces the same ideals as Maguire and accompanies him on this trek of redemption.I must admit that Jerry Maguire is not an Oscar worthy picture in the cinematic sense; it is as entertaining and oftentimes as moving as anything you may have seen but 5 Oscar nominations raises a few eyebrows. I suppose every year Hollywood needs to recognize a film that lives by the credo 'Everything may seem bad at the outset but there is light at the end of the tunnel and if you are true to yourself you will invariably succeed'. Maguire lives by this credo and audiences consequently loved it because Cruise reigns supreme at the end and as always, we love the guy!The first 1/2 of the film is particularly insightful and well presented. Cruise feels suffocated by the hypocisy of the world he lives in and needs to escape otherwise his soul will be devoured by the forces around him. We see ugly side of endorsements and promotions, the clash between money and loyalty (in fact there is no clash, money always is the bottom line!!) and greed and backstabbing that lies at the very heart of this world. Jerry Maguire is a metaphor not only resigned to the sports world, but to any competitive environment where only the fittest can survive!! Of course in the real world, the happy endings are few and far between, but what the hell!!! Cruise needs to exert real emotion into his role without tiring the audience. The movie is long and Cruise undergoes significant metamorphosis which will test the audiences patience and endurance. Some may become annoyed by Cruise who puts so much heart into this role that he sometimes completely over-acts and outdoes himself. Others will recognize that Cruise is still a young actor and is still learning, and therefore we should admire him for the committment he's given the role. And he sure is committed!!! He has to play the cold cynic, the ostracized has-been, the real nobody, the loser, the comeback kid, the romantic lover, and ultimately the victor all in one film. This is a tougher task than he may be given credit for.Cuba Gooding Jr, who won the oscar for best supporting actor, is the money-obsessed, second-rate hot head athlete that Maguire must transform in order for him to realize his full potential. Gooding like Cruise plays the chracater with a refershingly endearing streak that does so much to keep the film moving at the proper momentum. At the heart of his character is a man also searching for his identity. We see that he's man who is passionate about his wife and children but lacks heart when it comes to performing. Cruise must help him discover this. The chemistry between the two is explosive; they are together, onboard a ship without a destination. And they must navigate the ship otherwise they will be stuck at sea forever. Their plight is very convincing because we gradually see how fragile the two men are. At the outset we are introduced to two bad-ass contenders but as developments occur, the two men's weaknesses are exposed and they must find the inner strength and power of love to keep them afloat.Rene Zellwegger is a newcomer who is Cruises partner come love interest. Her charm and the warmth she brings to the screen cannot be ignored. She is vital to the film because she is so integral to the evolution of the central character. She need to be a good actress otherwise Cruise's performance is indirectly affected. If she cannot convince us, then Cruise's job becomes impossible. Gooding and Zellwegger are carrying Cruise on their shoulders. If they are not strong enough to sustain the weight, then the whole thing falls apart like a house of cards. Zellwegger has extra baggage in the form of her son Ray (Lipnicki), a kid with the most incredibly cute, awesome screen presence. It is so powerful that he steals each scene he is in and we are left begging for more from him. Cruise's attachment to the boy is the catalyst to the evolution of his relationship with the mother. As time goes on, we see Cruise marry Zellwegger because he doesn't want to lose the kid and not bacaue he fully loves her. This leads to an eventual painstaking conflict between the married couple who begin to fear that there is no hope for people like them. Cruise asks ""What do you want from me, my soul?"" to which Zellwegger replies ""Why not, I desrve that!"" It is a meaningful and moving scene as the two start to realize their marraige was a mistake. It is a saddening yet ironically identifiable moment. Cruise and Zellwegger are two good people in a world polluted by bad seeds. They should be perfect for one another because they both believe in the same things but the conflicts that surround them are just too apparent. It will take more than that for it to work and Cruise must search the pit of his soul to get it. His body language when he's around her exercises tremendous potential on his part as an actor. He seems so uncomfortable around her, whereas she is so keen to keep him close. It is a conflict that makes the audience feels uncomfortable. Back to Lipnicki,he needs to be convincing enough within limited screen time to turn Cruise's world upside down. And he does thereby intensifying the conflicts that envelop Cruise. Even love makes Cruise more confused. This is a strong ironic touch and we can easily identify with it. What's it's trying to tell us is even the good things in life can be detrimental if you don't fully believe in them. Cruise doesn't believe he can love so the confusion mounts.Side characters like malicious,venom-spitting rival agent Jay Mohr and ex-fiancee Kelly Preston give sound performances which manifest the horrible face of the environment that Cruise wishes to detach from. Of course their self-interest and killer instincts run counter to Cruise and we really do hate them. This makes Cruises comeback all the more popular with us because we want him to make them look silly. Bonnie Hunt plays Zellwegger's cynical (endearingly cynical) sister who vehemently opposes her sisters relationship because she thinks to know how it's all gonna end. She has been down the road that Gooding, Zellwegger, and Cruise are experiencing now and she fears it will all end in heartbreak. She is a very good actress with good screen presence and has always proved invaluable to the films she starred in.Cameron Crowe wrote and directed this film and although we don't get to see exceptional cinematography, his job proves very successful. The film could have been a flop had the cast been different. I say this because there are bits that go on for too long. It seems that Crowe knows where the film should have been cut but seems to have been more content to work the stretch and exhaust the audience with superfluous dialogue and scenes. His intention was to get maximum emotional effect from the audience but we often teeter on impatience and frustration. This does not ruin the film; the actors are so likeable that we are happy to bear the occasional superfluousness. Crowe, who also directed Singles, apparently considers himself a paragon in the field of relationships and he gets the thumbs up. The sentimental value is preserved throughout despite moments of cheesniness. Then again what realtionship film doesn't suffer from this????The soundtrack was much lamented but I think that the tracks from Aimee Mann, Springsteen, and Ricki Lee Jones are excellent and complement the various emotional facets of the film.Jerry Maguire is such an easy traget for bashing and I'm sure it's received it's fair share. But I cannot go down that road. I cannot be that cynical or else I would be in danger of having the world aroung me envelop and suffocate me. I am quick to cite the films shortcomings but I still loved it. Tom Cruise isn't the world's highest paid actor for no reason. He alone can make the film more than watchable but in this case he profits from an outstanding supporting cast that makes the job all the more easy.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Still one of the most enjoyable Cruise films ever, shot Zellweger to stardom, too","Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) is a hotshot sports agent. As such, he wants to get the fattest contracts for his clients because his own salary depends on it. He has a type A girlfriend, Avery (Kelly Preston) and a seemingly great life. But, one day, he has an epiphany. Jerry has seen the tears in the eyes of the children who wonder why Mr. Maguire is still talking money when their father or mother is gravely injured and probably shouldn't play again. Therefore, Jerry pens an open letter to his fellow agents at their huge firm, asking them to follow their hearts and not just the dollar signs. Although everyone initially claps Jer on the back, he is soon dumped. The executioner"" (Jay Mohr), a more senior agent, does it in a crowded restaurant where he also announces his plans to ""takeover"" everyone of Maguire's clients. All too soon it happens. Jerry retains only one athlete, Rod (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), an iffy client due to injuries. Cleaning out his desk, Jerry bravely tells the entire office he is opening his own agency and asks someone, anyone to go with him. Only one does. That would be Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellweger), a single mother of one darling son, Ray (Jonathan Lipnicki), who admired greatly the stance he took in his open letter. Yet, for both Jerry and Dorothy, the whole start-up biz is an extreme risk, with only one sure client. Meanwhile, Avery dumps her fiancé on his ear when he loses the chance to represent a rookie NFL quarterback. Truth is, Jerry's old agency told a bunch of lies to steal this young man away. To complicate matters more, Jerry asks Dorothy out on a date, which goes well. Can romance and infant businesses make a good mix? Will Maguire, who stuck his head out for something good, now have it chopped off in the cruel world of capitalism? This is without a doubt Cruise's most enjoyable flick. Even folks who think they don't care for him will enjoy this one. It doesn't hurt, of course, to have sidekicks in Zellweger, Gooding, Jr., Bonnie Hunt, Mohr, Preston and the darling Lipnicki. Then, too, Cameron Crowe, who wrote and directed this gem, deserves lots of praise as well. To complete the movie's success are great costumes, sets, and photography.

The films message which says that if you stick to what's in your heart - to hell with everything else works so great against a backdrop of fake corporate-style relationships, the worshipping of the almighty dollar, and backstabbing practices that are so  prevalent in this world. Jerry with his world crumbling around him, struggles to remain focused on the importance of his passion, honesty and integrity. The cynicism does its best to break his back but he's able to persevere by just listening to his heart. A wonderful movie for all people that may have felt that sometimes when life kicks you in the teeth you just have to follow your heart.",,Anonymous,Romance
Cute Black Guy,"""Jerry Maguire"" is an iconic film that brilliantly combines romance, drama, and sports, wrapped around themes of integrity, love, and personal growth. Tom Cruise delivers an unforgettable performance as Jerry, a sports agent who experiences a crisis of conscience, leading him to redefine his career and life. Renee Zellweger charms as Dorothy, bringing warmth and depth to the story. Cuba Gooding Jr. Shines, stealing scenes with his energetic, Oscar-winning role.

"One of the most charming, romantic, hilarious, and enchanting comedies about having the courage to express yourself I have ever seen","JERRY MAGUIRE, in my opinion, is one of the most charming, romantic, hilarious, and enchanting comedies about having the courage to express yourself I have ever seen. If you ask me, Alan Silvestri's score was absolutely romantic. In addition, I thought that the performances were superior, the directing was excellent, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the casting was perfect. Also, I was surprised that Dorothy (Renee Zellweger) decided to stick by Jerry (Tom Cruise) after he got fired. In addition, when he got dumped by Avery (Kelly Preston), my emotions were mixed. I'm sure yours will be, too. I laughed really hard when Rod (Cuba Gooding Jr.) and Jerry yelled, ""Show me the money!"" Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, ""Kudos to Cameron Crowe and everyone involved for a job well done."" Now, in conclusion, if you are a Tom Cruise, Cuba Gooding Jr., or Renee Zellweger, I highly recommend this movie. You're in for a feel good time, so see this movie today. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

One great movie,"Cruz has never been better. The character Jerry Maguire is developing on two levels, both based on connecting to another person and finally understanding the concept of loyalty witch Jerry has constantly talked about but never really understood. Cruise and Zellweger characters are perfectly complementary, his hastiness, her emotional side, their shared optimism and confusion were the main combination of their success. Cameron Crowe has a perfect career, every next film picks up where the previous one left off, raising the level of quality over its expected size. One thing is certain, ""Jerry Maguire,"" has enough emotional drive to fall in love with but a deeper context which we are constantly given will be the reason why you will appreciate it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""You had me at Hello""","This film spoke to me in so many ways. It was almost as if ""Jerry Maguire"" had been written with me in mind. From Jerry's epiphany at the start of the story through his struggle and eventual triumph over his fear of intimacy, it all seemed to be drawn from my experiences. These are the things that concern me every day. Tom Cruise was amazing. He showed perfect acting the whole time. It is perhaps, the finest work so far in his career. You could see every flicker of doubt and insincerity cross his face. I was laughing out loud, then crying and then so tightly happy that I forgot to breath. All of the other cast members seemed perfect as well. I particularly liked the doubting, divorced but totally caring sister Laurel. And let's not forget Dorothy's son Ray, what a little charmer.The person that stole the show for me was Cuba Gooding Jr. Every scene he was in made me laugh. This was the first movie I had seen him in and thought he was a terrific actor, deserved of the Oscar he won for Best Supporting Actor. The ""Show Me The Money"" scene will have you in stitches. His character changes the life of Jerry Maguire in the film and does it with such of enthusiasm that you can just admire Rod Tidwells life, where every piece is in the right order. The beautiful cinematography, editing and music makes the strong story and characters to look good. Yes I agree that it's very emotional, touchy and sweet, but why should we deny that we need that sometimes.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very Easy to Watch,"Jerry Maguire is not a perfect movie in the sense that it is a masterpiece, but it seems difficult to dislike this movie. Despite being rated R for some swearing and sexual content, this movie deals with the notion of family and is definitely easy enough for a child to watch. It is very entertaining while it is simultaneously a touching story about relationships and their importance in our lives.More than anything, Jerry Maguire is a film with heart. It can be argued that it has two protagonists: Jerry and Rod (played by Cuba Gooding Jr.) and both seem to need to learn about love. Jerry needs to connect to people, specifically to those who he claims to love, and Cuba needs to learn to play his sport with love and not just for the money. It is brilliant in the sense that Maguire's story and Rod's story are intertwined since the two depend on each other. Maguire is all about making relationships with clients more personal while Rod is all about wanting Jerry to pay attention to his needs. One is the professional, the other is the greedy showboat. Ultimately, they both depend on each other since Rod is Jerry's last client and since Jerry might be the only agent willing to put up with Rod's ego.The film is well-acted, especially by Cuba Gooding Jr., and we like each character for different reasons. The kids in this film are adorable, especially Ray, Dorothy's son, who proves to be funny even though we know he is the reason Jerry wants to get together with Dorothy.Half a sports film and half a romance, Jerry Maguire proves to be fun for a variety of people.3.5/4.0",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Great Movie,"Is there a movie that captures the 1990's better than writer-director Cameron Crowe's ""Jerry Maguire""? There might be, but it's hard to imagine a movie doing it better than this tale of a cynical, money-driven sports agent who abandons his high lifestyle to find refuge with a single mom and an enthusiastic client. It's a riches-to-rags story where the hero finds redemption, and it's wonderful. ""Jerry Maguire"" is everything a modern romantic comedy should be: smart, funny, character-driven, and incisive. Crowe occasionally allows his movie to drag a bit (It clocks in at just under two and a half hours)but his characters are so interesting and human, and their predicaments so vital and involving, that the movie's extended running time is hardly anything to complain about. Tom Cruise has never been better in a movie. He deserved his Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of the title character, who goes from greedy and shallow to warm and human. The charisma and confidence that have always served Cruise so well in his career are put to great use in the movie's very funny first half. Cruise really does something special in the second half of the film, however: He lets his guard down and allows Jerry's emotions to shine through. Cuba Gooding, Jr. won the Supporting Actor Oscar for his work as Rod Tidwell, Jerry's lone client after he leaves his sports agency. Gooding, Jr.'s performance is uniformily hilarious and perfectly over-the-top, but he never strays from showing Rod's human side, which is expressed through the character's love of his family. The other great performance in the film (and one that was sadly overlooked by Oscar) is Renee Zellweger's as Dorothy Boyd, the warmhearted assistant and single mom that Jerry falls for. The actress is a constant delight, lovable and energetic. But her character is not simply a sappy romantic foil for Jerry; She's an intelligent and perceptive woman who ultimately makes Jerry earn her love. The supporting roles in Crowe's film are also written with remarkable complexity and the actors portraying them all give terrific performances. Bonnie Hunt is tenderly funny as Dorothy's skeptical sister; Regina King is wonderfully spirited as Rod's loving wife; Kelly Preston is refreshingly ruthless as Jerry's coldhearted fiancee; Jay Mohr is enjoyably sleazy as Jerry's underhanded nemesis; Jerry O'Connell and Beau Bridges make a nicely believable future football star and his father, respectively. The real scene-stealer in this remarkable bunch, however, is young Jonathan Lipnicki, who is adorable and hysterical as Dorothy's son. This is a great movie. Crowe writes and directs moments of perfect tenderness that never become cloying or manipulative and he also has a knack for creating scenes of pure joy. Included throughout the film are monologues from Jerry's mentor, Dicky Fox, that allude to the film's overall themes. They are completely random and completely perfect and they show that Crowe (who also directed 1992's ""Singles"" and 1989's ""Say Anything..."") has not lost his sense of quirkiness. In fact, Crowe hasn't lost anything with this one. ""Jerry Maguire"" is a winner in every sense, a movie that overflows with intelligence, humor, romance, and enormously engaging characters. It's a perfect movie for its era, one of the decade's best comedies, and a glowing example that even a business as cynical and jaded as Hollywood can occasionally still do things right.",,Anonymous,Romance
Only Crowe Can Make Mid-Life Crises and Romance Blend So Well,"Still endearing, still entertaining, and still hilarious all these years later.

I pity those who can't feel the joy of watching these characters struggle and then find themselves when taking a chance on each other.

interesting love story,this is a suprisingly good effort by cameron crowe offering a very realistic approach to the love story theme. Cruise is excellent as always.

One problem: when Cruise's character tries to break things off with his wife (kelly preston) she resorts to beating him up. Sterotypical hollywood approach.

A Supprisingly Warm Hearted Comedy,"Firstly I would like to say that when I first heard about this movie I wasn't excited at all about seeing it. A sports agent that grows a conscience, gets fired and has to rebuild his career and most importantly his life, I thought I was in for a boring couple of hours watching your typical sports drama but how wrong could I have been. It actually had very little to do with sports. It was a love story but again not your typical one. For me, it was all the different characters that made this film such as success. Tom Cruise has always been kind of an action figure in his movies which he's good at but for me, playing Jerry Maguire was by far his best work ever. He has brilliant timing and plays a character who's down on his luck so well, he should have got an Oscar for this but it's not only him that deserves credit. They all do. From Dorothy (Rene Zellweger) as the doting mum who falls hopelessly in love with Jerry even though she knows she shouldn't and her adorable son Ray who even as a small child, he even steals some of the scenes in this film. Also I loved Bonnie Hunt in this. This role definitely suited her as she plays the disapproving sister of Dorothy's. And of course, probably the main reason to watch this is to see Cuba Gooding Jnr as he plays the American football star Rod Tydwell and he is absolutely brilliant as both him and Tom work really well with each other. This film has everything. It will make you laugh, cry and will make you feel good and will always be remembered, not only for those famous quotes but for the characters as well. I think those casting agents should congratulate themselves on this one. Watch it, I know you'll love it",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Real human beings,"Jerry Maguire is a comedic drama starring Tom Cruise, Renee Zellwegger, & Cuba Gooding Jr. among others. The story follows a sports agent named Jerry whose life is inadvertently turned upside down when he decides to write a ""manifesto"" describing how his fellow sports agents really act behind closed doors. And so begins the journey of Jerry Maguire.The acting is uniformly excellent across the board starting with a very down-to-earth performance from Tom Cruise as the title character Jerry. This character isn't necessarily unlike any of his previous characters. He starts out as basically a jerk before evolving into a sweet, caring individual. The thing that I believe sets his character of Jerry apart from the others that he's played, is the fact that he's actually acting like a real human being and not just some random drone that the writer created. He breathes life into Jerry in a way that I'm not sure another actor could have. I'm not the only one who thinks this either - Cruise was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance. Of course, Jerry would not be who he is throughout the movie without the help of his co- worker Dorothy Boyd who is played with a very sweet girl-next-door quality by Renee Zellwegger. I'm usually not a fan of hers, but for the first time in her career she showed me something that was very similar to that of Tom Cruise...she was able to create a fully rounded 100% human being who is very relatable. She's a single mother who carries herself very independently. She's not necessarily supremely confident in her actions, but she's definitely learned throughout the years of raising her son on her own that she doesn't really need anyone in her life except her son. At least that's what she thought. The final member of the cast to really make a lasting impact is Cuba Gooding Jr. who plays Rod Tidwell - a Wide Receiver for the Arizona Cardinals and Jerry's sole remaining client. This is a man who only wants to provide a great living for his family and against all odds he believes that Jerry Maguire is the man who can bring him to that promise land. That belief is heard loud and clear in one of the movies most talked about scenes where Rod and Jerry are on the phone together and Jerry is trying to persuade Rod into keeping him as his agent. Rod: ""It's something very personal, a very important thing. Hell! It's a family motto. Are you ready Jerry? I wanna make sure you're ready, brother. Here it is: Show me the money. Show! Me! The! Money! Jerry, it is such a pleasure to say that! Say it with me one time, Jerry."" Jerry: ""Show you the money."" Rod: ""No, no. You can do better than that! I want you to say it brother with meaning! Hey, I got Bob Sugar on the other line I bet you he can say it!"" Jerry: Yeah, yeah, no, no, no. Show you the money."" Rod: ""No! Not show you! Show me the money!"" This conversation alone shows just how much of a report Jerry and Rod have together and that report is exactly the reason why Rod decides to stick with Jerry as his agent. The conversation also proves that Rod Tidwell is also, just like Jerry and just like Dorothy, a complete 100% human being and it's Cuba Gooding's performance that proves it. He was also nominated for an Academy Award and he won for his performance.The beauty of Jerry Maguire and the thing that makes it so watchable is the fact that it's a very human story with very relatable characters. That's the main thing I look for in a movie...even if it has an extremely predictable story and a predictable outcome - the movie can overcome all of that as long as it has those relatable characters for us to follow along on this journey with. Over the years Jerry Maguire has also kind of taken its place among pop culture lore. Some of its quotes are still used today by several people around the world. That just goes to show how the lasting power of a movie like Jerry Maguire goes a very long way and that's a good way to judge a movies greatness in general years down the line.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Probably deserves its classic status...,"Watching Jerry Maguire again recently, I can understand its status as a (cult) classic of the 90s but the movie did not have such a strong effect on me.We follow Jerry Maguire on his transformation from cynical, go-getter player agent to a less materialistic, better grounded person. Here's the first reason I had problems getting immersed: we only get but a glimpse of his former, superficial life and jump right into the ""epiphany"" portion where he longs for change. From a dramatic point of view, it makes the character's transition less lifelike and we lose the impact of such a transformation. Not to mention all the comedy moment we probably miss out (cynical characters lend themselves well to comedy and good setups that can be exploited later on).As much as the central figure is Jerry Maguire, two other characters go through transformations themselves: Dorothy Boyd is Maguire's love interest. A young single mother in a precarious situation (fringe job, living with her sister and longing for partner to complete her family). Rod Tidwell is the typical feisty but underrated player at a critical juncture of his short football career, looking for a big payoff in his next (and likely last) contract.Tom Cruise is excellent in a role that fits him like a glove. He is right in his comfort zone in this role which makes it easy effortless to become Jerry Maguire. As much as sometimes we find him clueless and want to punch him, we greatly enjoy the ride. Renée Zellweger was probably put on the bigger Hollywood map thanks to her role as Dorothy Boyd. Zellweger, much like Cruise, is perfectly cast here. These roles as quirky, vulnerable, romantic interest are almost a speciality for her (think Bridget Jones, Me Myself and Irene, Nurse Betty) and she is immediately endearing and she makes people around her shine in scenes. A good actress with a good feel for chemistry and synergy. And lastly is Cuba Gooding Jr. as the sometimes hilarious, sometimes obnoxious Rod Tidwell. Gooding sometimes overreaches to the point where the character is nothing more than a caricature, and none of it is as well done as, say, the various weird, over-the-top characters that populate The Big Lebowski, for instance.The famous ""show me the money scene"" probably deserves its cult status but loses a lot of impact the second time around. You wish the script was a little tighter in some places, that more context was provided. The mix of drama and comedy often feels a bit awkward.The peripheral characters are lacking. Particularly Dorothy's kid, Ray... who ends up annoying most viewers and is not endearing at all. Dorothy's sister and Tidwell's wife (both acting as catalysts to push Dorothy and Tidwell to bigger and better things) are also equally annoying.The direction is unremarkable. The cinematography is sub par. Every memorable scenes (there are few) is driven by acting and a lot of the quotes sound rather cheesy and corny for a movie from the 90s. ""You had me at hello"" is what one might expect from a 50s movie, not the 90s.But through it all, Cameron Crowe manages to never sink completely into happy-happy Hollywood crapola, making Maguire a flawed and somewhat believable character. If only the lines had been refined. The writing is too self-conscious at times and the movie doesn't expand enough on the ""old Maguire"" to make the journey he takes truly remarkable.It's still a good movie and deserves at least one viewing. Especially worth it for the great chemistry between the three actors, a very strong and engaging premise and some memorable scenes.I can totally see why it's a classic but it just didn't do it for me enough to buy a DVD.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Even though it has various parts I did not like, this was not enough for me not to think this is a top movie.Tom Cruise has never been better and the acting is amazing.The script hits the button.What I liked most was the director Cameron Crowe this was the first film I had seen from him and he impressed me so much it is hard to express it in words.Bruce Springsteen's Secret Garden is a brilliant song and over an emotional, intelligent, absorbing cinematic experience.A MUST SEE",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Classic,"This has to be one of the best relationship comedies out there, right up there with When Harry Met Sally. And one of the most quoted too. Cruise and Zelwegger are at the best and every time I hear him say ""The Zoo is F*(&^&*^*&^ closed"" I burst out in laughter. Some may say that Cameron Crowe's overrated, but I think he's underrated. Almost Famous is another one of his greats.The actor's have a good chemistry with each other and it looks like they had un making this movie. I think Tom's got alott of bad press in the last year because at the base of it all, he's a great actor. Period.Love this movie and can't wait to see what Crowe does next.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Great movie, must-see","One of Tom Cruise's finest movies, Jerry Maquire is a classic.  Will be on TCM regularly as a great in about 30 to 40 years time.

"It's a love story, not a film about sport agency","I was misled by the description, I tought that I would see the business life of a sport agent. I seriously doubt, that the few scenes which were about this topic are realistic.And Maguire is one of the worst agent I could imagine. You can't see him work at all, only just watching games and telling his player to play from his heart (while he has good stats already...).During negotiations his only argument was: ""I'm asking for a favor"". In business.. I understand, that sometime it could work, but it's not interesting in a movie.Come on, you are an agent of a player with nice stats and talent. If his current team doesn't plan with him long term, just look for a trade partner, do some real business work!For a love story it's nice, sentimental and quiet unusual. About a man, who loves a kid more than the kid's mom. But there are other layer's of human emoitons and relationships. The sportman-agent connection also wants to be a ""love story"", a friendship thing but for me that's not really working - maybe because I didn't like the business part of it.Anyway, there is a cute kid and I think it could be the sexiest act of Renée Zellweger.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Heart-Warming and Thoughtful,"Jerry Maguire is one of my favorite movies, because it's a modern movie with a heart and soul. Not very many modern comedy/drama/romances actually have one, but that is what this movie is all about: relationships. Although there are some cliched moments where it seems like the typical comedy/romance, the romance part actually explores issues about true love, intimacy, marriage, and commitment that most movies are afraid to, even though these are very timely issues. The questions of why we marry, why we are we afraid of commitment and intimacy, and what true love is are all explored by the film, as well as deeper questions about what is important in our lives, through the lives of Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise), Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellweger), Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) and his family, and various other characters throughout the film. In addition to the excellent script however, the acting is also great. Cruise, Gooding, and Zellweger are all wonderful, and Bonnie Hunt shines as Laurel, Dorothy's protective older sister.It's not the best movie of all time, but is in my top 10, and I laugh and cry every time I see it. I recommend it highly. (9/10)",,Anonymous,Romance

Always a welcome watch.,"I regret not seeing ""Jerry Maguire"" when it was in the theater. I wasn't that big a fan of Tom Cruise at the time. With the exception of ""Mission Impossible"", Cruise had six or seven movies in a row that I either didn't like or had no interest in. When I finally caught up to ""Jerry Maguire"", I found it impossible to resist. It is not a perfect movie. It does lose it way for a little while. At the end of the day, ""Jerry Maguire"" is a beautifully acted, emotional movie. It is always a satisfying, eye wiping watch. Honorable mention: a dreamy Renee Zellweger.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
An ideal showcase for Tom Cruise expertly crafted by Cameron Crowe,"In a career full of high profile movies, ""Jerry Maguire"" represents perhaps Tom Cruise's single best performance. Playing a sports agent fired from his job after having a moral epiphany, Cruise's effortless charm fits the role perfectly. His character's slick exterior comes naturally but what's surprising is the depth of emotion that's exposed over the course of the movie.Cameron Crowe's Oscar-nominated script is integral to the success of the film. With the premise established, the plot follows Jerry as he desperately holds on to his last remaining client (Cuba Gooding Jr.) and the one co-worker who stood by him (Renée Zellweger). Part love story, part comedy and part sports drama, the movie should not be dismissed out of hand as a typical shallow rom-com.As already noted, Tom Cruise is the movie's anchor. His Oscar nomination was well deserved but he didn't have to carry the movie by himself. Cuba Gooding Jr. made the most of his character and found his career-best performance rewarded with an Oscar. Renée Zellweger excelled in her role as well, which turned out to be her breakout performance. Of the many notable supporting players, the most memorable are probably Regina King, Jay Mohr and young Jonathan Lipnicki.Visually, the movie is exceptional. Cameron Crowe's deft direction and the vibrant cinematography of two time Oscar winner Janusz Kaminski combine to create a consistently attractive viewing experience. The well-chosen soundtrack also deserves praise, with several memorable selections, including the Bruce Springsteen hit ""Secret Garden"".All in all, ""Jerry Maguire"" is a movie that holds up surprisingly well and represents some of the best work from those involved. Not just a typical Tom Cruise vehicle, the movie captures something special with memorable moments like the classic ""Show me the money!"" scene.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Romantic comedy disguised as a sports movie,"This movie seems to be a mix of many different genres (comedy, romance, drama, sports, money) and we can see as to why it is such loved. But as a film, it is actually quite pretentious, and overly long and sappy. The sports angle starts off as intriguing but once the romance and love story come in, it takes away from the excitement, and becomes a predictable rom-com.The performance from Tom Cruise is him playing his essential character, lovable guy but also a slick ""all about me"" type. He's the lead and who we are supposed to root for. Cuba Gooding Jr. won an Oscar for his role but was playing a more over the top athlete type, and came across as annoying- yet people love his character and performance for how ""authentic"" it is. And Renee Zellweger is the love interest but happens to be a rather weak and uninteresting character. Also her son is one of the more annoying and corny characters in the film.People love this film for its famous catchphrases (""Show me the money!"", ""You complete me"", ""You had me at hello"") and it has a nostalgic feel.It seems that Cameron Crowe desperately tried making a film to ponder to many different demographics, and seeing its box office resume and the fact it won or was nominated for several awards, he succeeded in that sense. But as an audience opinion, the film isn't serious enough to be a drama, not funny enough to work as a comedy, too womanly to be a sports movie, and too sporty for a Lifetime movie.Overall, Jerry Maguire is watchable and somewhat intriguing at times, but as a while is quite long and becomes a bore. It really is a romantic comedy disguised as a sports film. Not nearly as great as people clamor for it.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
it touched me,"I have a theory. Romance movies tell people more about themselves than any other type of film. This film touched me. I was more deeply moved by this films sincerity than by all of ""Titanic's"" sap. The film is a story of a man who finds himself in the middle of his life is one of the most amazing stories I've ever seen. A man who was self aware enough to stop himself on the road to fruitless life soon enough to turn around and straighten his life out.It was a touching character study of two men of completely different backgrounds who go through a series of events that change them for the better. This movie was inspiring. It's never to late to fix your life. The best films are the ones that motivate, inspire, or show you things about yourself that you would've otherwise overlooked.

"First Rate Actors, 90s Clichés","I will try to not parrot what has already been said about the movie, for better or worse. I have nothing against the actors of the feature film. They were the best of the best in that genre and generation. My issue is with all the product placement and overall marketing that the film is bombarded with ranging from Reebok, Apple Jacks, NFL and I don't know how many other products. If one is not discerning, one can fall for it and feel like ESPN is the ultimate authority in sports and that the NFL is the best thing that there is. I won't question the integrity of these entities because that's not what this review is about. The cameos from real life corporate executives further reinforced the marketing at play her. I just think that it would have felt more artistic and original to have come up with a pretend organization resembling the ones mentioned so that the viewer is not resold on the idea that big corporations truly benefit humanity and actually constitute a culture.For a movie about redemption and love, there is the underlying message that money and materialism is the agent that facilitates can destroy and redeem you. This may be true, and I am no bleeding heart; but movies should not always reinforce the obvious.One of the more positive aspects of the movie was seeing the Tidwell's as a normal and married black couple rather than bickering losers having illegitimate offspring. You could see Crowe's sensitivity and trying to elevate the dialogue without being soppy.I think what made this movie so zeitgeist was that it captured and incorporated the rampant and materialism of the 1990s. This decade was more greedy than the 80s because suddenly actors and athletes had the fattest paychecks simply for being entertainers. They suddenly became royalty. This decade was the beginning of the endorsement culture that blew up in the 2000s. The general public truly believed that bigger was better and resented being told otherwise. SUV's, designer clothes, limitless credit cards, supersized meals and Venti sized coffee's were almost a requirement.If you want to see a well acted film you will not be disappointed. I recommend looking at the movie with a grain of salt and detaching oneself from the underlying capitalist and elitist message that it sends.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

This doesn't complete me...,"Tom Cruise is an actor I've never had much time for. He has a certain way of looking in situations that shock his characters that I never found realistic, and it borders on annoying. Also, I can't help but feel his career is slipping downhill in recent years.Anyway, this is a review of 'Jerry Maguire' not Tom Cruise. This movie was fairly poor, for a few reasons.Firstly, the acting fails to convince, Cruise gives a respectable performance and Gooding Jr, having seen him in two movies, gives the best performance of his career (but not Oscar worthy; how did that happen?) and Bonnie Hunt puts in a decent shift. It is Rene that unfortunately drags the movie down. Her character is overly vulnerable, to an almost caricature point, and I'm not sure if its down to the script or her, but she looked uncomfortable in the role. Combined with a weak and predictable plot, a overly long running time and several thoroughly annoying characters, this movie fails in just about every department.You can do far worse than 'Jerry Maguire', but not worth the view",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Moving,gripping, fantastic film","This is a superb film in every facet, it has a little bit of everything and thats why its so hard to categorize.It has comedy, romance and action in equal portions.Cameron Crowe wrote and directed this film and he did both superbly.  The dialogue is sharp throughout and not a word is wasted, and as a director he allows the film to flow beautifully and manages to keep your full attention for 140mins.  The action moves from side splittingly funny to moving and back to funny seamlessly.But Crowe's job is made far easier by the cast that was put before him.Cruise puts in one of his best performances along with Renee Zellweger, but the real star for me was Cuba Gooding Jr in his Oscar winning support role. He plays the arrogant, funny and ultimately loveable American footballer player Rod Tidwell.  Cruise is his agent and has just lost everything he had worked so hard to get by sending a mission statement to his office criticising their way of doing things.His only client is Rod Sidwell and his only friends Dorothy Boyd and her cute kid.  Together they have to make it work.The score is upbeat and cool like the rest of the film,The film was nominated for five academy awards and in another year would have cleared up.

A feel-good romantic comedy that's actually good,"You can make a feel-good comedy completely devoid of reason, intelligence, and good performances, or you can make a movie like this one. I liked this movie because Tom Cruise and Cuba Gooding, Jr. played such likable, energetic characters, and because Renee Zellweger was not the stereotypical romantic comedy woman where she is required to behave irrationally and hate her leading man for a good stretch of the last ten minutes of the film until he does something sweet that makes her like him again. The film doesn't have that kind of tone to it - it's more realistic, it deals SERIOUSLY with the emotions of the characters while staying COMEDIC.Oh, and the two kids were so cute!Highly recommended.",,Anonymous,Romance
Doesn't justify the hype.,"When I saw this film, I had somewhat high expectations, considering the notoriety, rave reviews and public praise that the film has garnered over the years. However, I didn't feel they were absolutely true. It seems to me that there is a ""hype"" surrounding the film that makes it seem wrong to point out its flaws.The film tells the story of Jerry Maguire, a highly successful sports agent who helped many sports stars become rich and recognized. However, in some poorly explained way, he ends up suffering a crisis of conscience that leads him to question everything he has done up until then. He therefore believes that the best way forward will be to accept fewer athletes, with obvious losses in income, in order to give them the maximum attention possible. Not content with trying to act differently, he tries to convince his boss and most of his colleagues that his idea is the right way to go. Of course, he was quickly fired, and his colleagues turned their backs on him when he announced he was going to start a competing firm with athletes who were still willing to follow him. Only one athlete has done this, a very promising American football player. And yet, everything seems set up to go wrong.Directed by Cameron Crowe, the film was a huge success and received great acclaim from critics and audiences. However, I don't hesitate to call it an average production, a film that isn't bad, but isn't really good either. The director manages to excel in several technical aspects, such as photography, filming and design of the sets, but stumbles in others, such as editing, which gave the film an exaggeratedly slow pace and devoid of any dynamics that would keep the audience attentive to the action. There are entire scenes that could, and perhaps should, have been deleted. As for the soundtrack, I can say that I liked the choice of songs and melodies, but I didn't like the way they were used. They almost always sound intrusive and unwelcome.The script's idea was good, and I understand that the film sought a melodramatic appeal to captivate the audience. However, aside from a good handful of noteworthy quotes, the script is little more than a sentimental story to the point of manipulation, too light and superficial, which would certainly benefit from a deeper analysis and treatment. The greatest proof of this are the characters, which are almost limited to a succession of basic clichés that we could find in some course work of a freshman in film school.The poor written material and the apparent poor quality of the director help us to understand the below-average acting with which most of the actors present were satisfied. Tom Cruise is one of those handsome and charismatic actors, but who never really caught my attention due to his acting skills. He plays action or heartthrob roles very well, but he's not a great dramatic actor, and in this film he was just himself, but under pressure. Beside him, the friendly Renée Zellweger did everything she could to help, and I praise her effort, but she couldn't go beyond a dry romantic couple, unbelievably fragile and hardly credible in her intentions and feelings. Cuba Gooding Jr., on the other hand, gives his all to the character and tries harder than usual in this film, but we have to agree that he wasn't a character that demanded much of him. As for Jonathan Lipnicki... he's cool and nothing more.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
the best movie ever,this movie is the best because it shows all those times when we are the happiest and through the movie the idea that he has accomplished what he wrote in his book on accident is what makes this movie so great the only scene where i did not like it when tom cruise was drunk and i think he made a little to much of an ass of himself. but the best part was when he was singing free falling in the car. He waqs so happy and then it just went away when he lost that guy to sugar. I think that Jerry Mcguire was the best Tom cruise movie ever 2nd is minority report and 3rd is a tie between war of the worlds and mission impossible. if you think so reply and i will read it but i can not stand people who just bash this movie because everyone i know got something out of it.,,Anonymous,Romance
It hangs on your back like a load of logs.,"Be it in sport or carrier. The story of an individual's success after a s*** load of odds is always something that we can connect to in one way or another. I tried to watch this movie in one piece but could never sit through this. It just tests our patience and our intelligence. Like the scene where Jerry realizes and says ""he hated his place in the world"" coz of what he had become ""another shark in a suit"". The scene that made him realize that and the montages that follow through after that lacks even the slightest emotion so one can connect to his change over to what he really wants to be. That's when the titles roll. That's what you get from the rest of the movie. Its like somebody pushing down savor-less food down your throat. The only relief was Jonathan Lipnicki. Not many may like him but he actually comes as a breather in a the film that lacks emotions.

The idealistic plotline makes each and every one of us look around at society as it is today with the scorn it often deserves.It is a powerful movie that I will always remember as one of the best I've seen: perfect casting and superior storyline combined with the finest acting, make it peak above all others in recent memory.",,Anonymous,Romance

Tom Cruise somehow manages to portray an over-confident and hyper-active guy with great teeth,"LIke that other big budget, high-gloss exercise in subservsion, ""Fight Club"", this big budget, high-gloss movie is packed with perfect-looking people claiming to be fighting for freedom, individuality, the common man, the little guy, truth, justice and the American Way.  This kind of film is much more palatable when all concerned are unbelievably gorgeous and dentally superior to the rest of us mere mortals.  ""Fight Club"" would not have been nearly so attractive a proposition if the Brad Pitt role had been taken by Steve Buscemi.  Likewise, ""Jerry Maguire"" would have its work cut out if its central role were played by Danny Devito.  It's so much easier to be subversive if you are charismatic and physically perfect.For the record, Tom Cruise plays the eponymous sports agent, who suffers a crisis of conscience and decides to go it alone, and be, y'know, a better sports agent.  And hey, if that means making millions of dollars along the way, so be it.  Yeah, I know, sounds pretty awful doesn't it?  Sounds like the kind of movie that makes you want to slash the seats and torch the cinema.  And yet, somehow, it transpires that Cameron Crowe has managed to write a witty, fast-paced, character-driven script and directed it with such verve and style that all criticism seems redundant. He's very good at this sort of thing.  Like his more recent ""Almost Famous"" this is the kind of film you thought they didn't make any more: Hollywood Bollocks, yes, but the kind of HB you don't mind.  In fact, the kind of HB you wish would never end. All the performances are excellent, meaning that Mr Cruise has now, to the best of my knowledge, appeared in a grand total of three good movies (I've not seen ""Vanilla Sky"" yet): ""Color (sic) of Money"", ""Magnolia"" and this. When you compare this with the rest of his oeuvre, okay, the duds outweight the gold nuggets by about five to one, but even so. Renee Zellweger, meanwhile, proves she can play Americans almost as well as English people, with her fine portrayal of the plucky Dorothy.  Her kid has too much sticky-up hair and annoying glasses, but otherwise he's okay. Cuba Gooding Jr (a name to conjure with.  Has he got a brother called Chile? A siter called Argentina?) gives the performance he seems to be spending the rest of his career recovering from.  He's on top form here, as the enthusiastic American footballer who stands by Jerry, for all the right reasons.  The scenes with his family watching him, anxiously waiting for him to get up from what looked like a crippling injury are both heart-rending and hilarious.  Which would seem to be Crowe's speciality - tugging at the heart strings and making you laugh, sometimes simultaneously.  In the ever-more vacuous world of Hollywood, his brand of comedy/drama/whatever is more and more necessary.",,Anonymous,Romance
A top sports agent is sacked and has to face up to the harshness of rejection,"I'm not really too hot about Tom Cruise, but this film changed all my opinions about him. I think this and Rainman are his best works by far. Jerry Maguire (Cruise) is a top sports agent but when he does a memo stating his film should be more human, he gets the sack. He leaves taking the goldfish, his one client left Rod Tidwell (An excellent Cuba Gooding Jr) and one of the accountants Dorothy a single mum (Renee Zellweger). This film is superb and really deals with people's emotions. Tom Cruise is excellent as the confused Jerry Maguire, Cuba Gooding Jr is both funny and sweet as Rod Tidwell and got a well deserved Best Supporting Actor Oscar (Show me the money!)

Hollywood at its highest,"I just finished my forth viewing of the movie and in one thing I disagree with some of the reviewers is that t gets better with every viewing. I think when it comes to ""Jerry Maguire"" the best experience you get from the first time, but nevertheless this is one of the sweetest, most adorable movies I've ever seen in my life. Beautiful film.This is movie about transformation, about finding yourself in this ""cynical world"" with ""though competitors"" in every aspect of our lives. Competition. The survival of the fittest. It's a movie about true values, about friendship or maybe loyalty, money, being able to sleep at night, enjoying what you are doing, it's movie about learning what really matters, it's about being happy. Actually this is a movie about love. I found it. It is about living out onefs life with the one who makes you say: ""I love you. You... complete me"".   The casting was great. Renee Zellweger was the hearth of the movie. This film made her a star but unfortunately there hasn't been much from her ever since. Cuba Gooding Jr. deserves his Oscar for supporting role and Regina King as his wife was perfect. And of course this is Tom Cruise's movie, top to bottom, though I don't think that this is his best performance. My favorite one is in ""Interview with the Vampire"".Cameron Crowe the music critic-turned-director, the creator of this film. That's why the music in each of his movies fits so right.

Well crafted and enjoyable but lightweight,"This is a well-made, entertaining film with excellent performances, but it is let down by a lack of substance. Tom Cruise is perfectly cast as Jerry Maguire, a sports agent seemingly as superficial and go-getting as any in his business, until one day he gets back in touch with his conscience, issues a touchy-feely mission statement, and is duly fired by his corporation. Renee Zellwegger is as sweet as only she can be, playing widowed mother Dorothy, who follows Jerry into the wilderness and into a relationship. And Cuba Gooding Jr earned an Oscar for his stand-out role as Rod Tidwell, a fearless wide receiver for the Arizona Cardinals, and the only client to stick with Jerry.The problem is that while Jerry may be a tad more personable than fellow agents, the film fails to demonstrate that his change of heart leads to his doing business any less materialistically or more ethically than they do. Clearly, he isn't helped by Tidwell, who is portrayed as charismatic, straight-talking and family-loving, but also fixated on getting big bucks - as exemplified in the great ""Show me the Money"" scene. Indeed, if the film has any message at all, it is that there is precious little scope for ethics in the sports agency business, and that Jerry's moralistic crusade is doomed to failure - but it's unlikely that this is what writer/director Cameron Crowe was actually trying to say.Correspondingly, on the romantic front, the movie is rather lightweight and vague. Jerry and Dorothy have their inevitable getting togethers and breaking-ups, but on none of the occasions is there a great deal of passion or thought. Again, we could put a cynical spin on the movie - Dorothy only wants Jerry as a father for her cute son Ray (Jonathan Lipnicki); and Jerry wants a son more than a wife - but it's doubtful if that's what Crowe wants us to think.It's a pity; Crowe could have made a stronger film if he'd given his characters some tougher choices, and had been willing to sacrifice a bit of the fun for some real conflict - conveyed by action as well as words.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Overrated, but still a good drama","I find ""Jerry Maguire"" incredibly overrated, and it shouldn't have been nominated for such awards as ""Best Picture"" and ""Best Actor"".  It's a good drama, but it's certainly nothing different from the usual Tom Cruise flick.Although, if there is anything in this movie that deserved it's award, it'd definitely be Cuba Gooding Jr.'s performance.  He plays the loud, obnoxious, but still lovable football player Rod Tidwell.  Gooding Jr.'s acting is one hundred percent, and he deserved his Oscar win.Aside from the supporting actor, this is an overrated, sappy, ""feel good"" movie.  7/10.",,Anonymous,Romance
A Mission Statement Worth Your Time & Money,"Juggling elements of comedy, romance, drama & sports and crafted with such tenderness that the film has you under its grip even before revealing what it's about or where it's headed, Jerry Maguire is a hilarious & heartening delight that's crafted with sincerity, told with affection and vastly benefits from passionate performances from its fab cast to deliver one hell of a roller-coaster.Written & directed by Cameron Crowe, the story interweaves several subplots & threads that at first seem trivial yet it all works out beautifully in the end. The focus remains on our titular protagonist but it still gives ample weight to other characters' struggles through their relations with him. And while it starts on a cold & cynical note, it smoothly & steadily manages to steer itself into the emotional, uplifting & inspiring zone.It definitely helps to have well-defined characters worth giving a damn about and they are written with care & consideration here. The film never loses its funny side and is amusing throughout but it also captures all these relationships with a warmth & intimacy that stands out. Tom Cruise is terrific as the titular sports agent and his chemistry with the kid, Cuba Gooding Jr. & Renée Zellweger has a very pleasant, lifelike quality to it.Overall, Jerry Maguire brims with heart, soul, goodness & authenticity in addition to absolute commitment from its excellent ensemble and makes for a fun, enjoyable & entertaining ride that journeys in various directions but never loses sight of its final destination. A mission statement about all the wrong places that business world prioritises & invests into and where it needs to be for better dividends, this feel-good crowd-pleaser still packs a heartwarming flair.",,Anonymous,Romance
show me the money...sorry I couldnt resist,"I'm not a big fan of Tom Cruise but I will say that he carries this movie like Bill's Movers Co. He stars as a very well respected sports agent who has everything going for him. He has a delicious Kelly Preston as his fiance,the respect of his peers, success and ties with the sports world. What he doesnt have is the relationships with the people that he wants to. He is wants so much more but cant express it. So he types up a memo for his agency addressing the goals that he wants and how everything could be better run. He is fired and his dignity is shred. The only remaining client he has is a hyped up Cuba Gooding Jr. who he promises will get the cash money that he wants. Rene Zellweger plays his secretary who believes in him and left her other job for him. Jerry's fiance leaves him and eventually he falls for Rene. The ending is sappy and predictable but you got to hand it to Cameron Crowe for making it durable. Strong performances by everyone. Jerry cantrell rocks out in a small role.*** 1/2",,Anonymous,Romance
Henry and Kristl  stopped watching Jerry Maguire,"""I didn't know it was a romantic comedy."" Kristl said. She was leaning back into the couch in the garage turned movie theater,""I was completely fooled by the name and the fact it said someone wrote a statement against greed in sports. I thought it would be a drama in which someone rejects greed. Instead it is just a story vehicle to have two people meet.""""I didn't know either. A romantic comedy! The last one I saw was When Harry met Sally. I think that was more than enough romcom to last me a lifetime."" Henry laid down the remote. ""So what now?""""Maybe we ought to sit it out..You know, can we judge a movie based on the first thirty minutes? Although it has Tom Cruise in it. A romantic comedy with Tom Cruise. That is so wrong.""""And no action. And Renee Zellweger..the girl that looks like she is perpetually on the verge of a nervous breakdown and about to cry. I think she can't really act, just plays one person called Renee Zellweger with one facial expression.""""She does it very well though. But Tom Cruise as an love interest. Horrible. I can't see him as a nice man in this movie, but as a sleek guy with a fake smile... but most of all, his cold eyes.. Brr."" Kristl shivered, ""But he was great in movies like Born on the Fourth of July, or Rain Man or Collateral.""""To be fair we ought to watch a movie with Tom Cruise at his best. A movie where he kicks ass,"" Henry said, ""Like Mission Impossible.""""Beg your pardon?"" Kristl raised an eyebrow.""Minority Report then?""""Are you serious?""""The Last Samurai?""""Nope."" Kristl shook her head.""What then? Not Rain Man please""""How about Collateral?""""It's a deal.""",,Anonymous,Romance
Somewhat silly but still entertaining,"Contains one minor spoiler: Jerry Maguire it's one of those classics that people talk about and remember for years. However when the film came out, I was only 6, so I watched it for the first time today. Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise), is a very successful sports agent. His job requires him to constantly manipulate,lie and deceive and he's great at it. But one day, Jerry starts to have second thoughts about the nature of the job, he starts to question himself and ultimately grows a conscience. He proceeds to write a ""mission statement"" suggesting a change of behavior and alternatives to the current methods being used by agents, and because of it, he gets fired. Only one client stays with Jerry, Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr.), an egomaniacal football player. Meanwhile Jerry starts a relationship with Doroty (Renée Zellweger), a 26 year old single-mother who worked at his agency but decided to quit and help Jerry because she was inspired by the mission statement and also because she has a crush on him. Now Jerry has to balance his personal life and help his only client reach success... Jerry Maguire it's a good film, entertaining and somewhat engaging, however it does gets a bit touchy-feely and corny at times. The writing has some inconsistencies, for instance; Jerry marries Dorothy, basically because he doesn't know how/want to be alone. Later on, he starts to question the marriage and his feelings, only to come to the conclusion( after a quick break up) that he does love her. It's just not very good writing, if you ask me. Having said that, Tom Cruise carries the film on his back and delivers a tremendous performance. Now that I'm seeing his ""old"" films, no wonder he went on to become such a movie star. He has tons of charisma and it shows on screen. Cuba Gooding Jr was great and very funny as Tidwell, Jerry's only client, but, although he did won one, it's far from being an Oscar-worthy performance. Renée Zellweger was OK and so was the rest of the supporting cast. All in all, Jerry Maguire is not great, but it's still a good time. The film is also known for some lines that have become extremely famous and its funny too see how it all began. Watch it for Cruise's performance and for its classic status.7/10",,Anonymous,Romance
Cinematic equivalence to vomit,"Let me just point out the arrangement of roles for the film: A white agent, a black football player. I have to agree with some friend's assessments that this is a deplorable stereotype, however it's nowhere near explanatory in providing the details on why this film reeks.I thought the morality tale was poorly conceived, and it didn't look like Cruise's character changed much towards the end. (He was supposed to ""find his scruples"", but I didn't see much in the fellow except that he was less constipated than before.) The romance has faux-sugar sweet, and I can't see it appealing to anyone except romance fanatics (but according to the story, that's not what the film was made for.)It would have been interesting, if, the film was instead about a coach (not an agent) who physically and mentally assaults his players to the point that he's fined, and perhaps sentenced to jail. When he leaves jail, he finds the sport he stands up for is nothing more than barbaric and starts out by denouncing the commercialism mounted behind it. That would make the film increasingly more interesting, especially due to the fact that people who don't watch sports may find this moving and fascinating. I'm sure the idea will eventually be used.But this is a poor movie. Thumbs down.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Made by yuppie scum, for yuppie scum. DIE YUPPIE SCUM!!","Big cheese sports agent Tom Cruise is struggling to find meaning in his lucrative shark-in-a-suit, love-em-and-leave-em, what's-my-client's-name-again existence. In a fit of what passes for normality in this movie he writes a ""shocking"" Mission Statement and loses his job. His only supporters are his sole client Cuba Gooding Jr., and lowly clerical worker Renee Zellweger, who works for him for apparently no salary, takes him home to her sister and sickly little boy, and of course falls in love with him. Of course Tom has to redeem himself and prove he's worthy of Renee by the most meaningful challenge the writers could think of (one that's undoubtedly near and dear to their hearts) - getting his overpaid client millions and millions of dollars instead of just millions of dollars.The first thing that I can't stand about the movie is that it's deadly serious about all those buzzwords and management fads that make my teeth crawl in real life. Like how Tom loses his job over a Really Important Mission Statement - have you ever known an actual working human being (not a yuppie) who takes those things seriously? And the way Tom constantly uses the phrase ""Customer Service"" to make his firing worthwhile and give meaning to his shallow existence. In the real world ""Customer Service"" has an entirely different meaning: It's a terrifying buzzword that inhuman managers use to mean ""I don't just want 8 hours of work from my employees - I want to control every aspect of their behavior, I want to micromanage away their individuality, I want their very souls!"". And the writers seem to think it's inspirational.Tom Cruise is as slick and shallow as Cameron Crowe's direction, all dazzling grins and big-eyed vulnerable looks photographed from the most flattering angle, his usual Star performance. The supporting cast is excellent, in fact much better than the two leads. Bonnie Hunt as Renee's bitter sister has all the good lines and shares scene-stealing honors with five-year-old Jonathan Lipnicki, a genuinely cute child actor, and the lively and charming Cuba Gooding Jr. But it's Renee Zellweger's `Dorothy' who delivers the other killer blow to what might have been a good. better film. The character is the most annoying female lead of recent years. She's introduced on an airplane where the audience is supposed to feel sorry for her because she has to fly coach! Where she isn't given ONE glass of champagne, oh da poor widdle ting!  Face it, her character is truly gullible and dimwitted, and like many badly written female characters, never talks about her own needs, just what she can do for Jerry.  She's not a written as a person, she and her kid are just there to allow Jerry The Jerk to show his vulnerable, caring side - in relationships that are 100% All About Him. (Plus she strongly reminds me of some real-life women who act vulnerable and self-sacrificing, and are in fact manipulative bitches)In short, if you like this film you probably are or aspire to be the kind of yuppie who inspired the catchphrase ""Die Yuppie Scum"". Let this movie serve not as entertainment, but as a test and a wake-up call. If you enjoy it at all, or identify with Tom, or even go through the whole film without ever once wanting to hit any of these people - change your life immediately! It may not be too late for you to rejoin the human race!DIE YUPPIE SCUM!!!",,Anonymous,Romance
Dull comedy,"I waited lots of this movie, but I was very disappointed when I saw this movie. It was dull and not worth of watching many times. The beginning is good and the actors are good, especially Tom Cruise. I would give this ** stars out of ***** (4 out of 10).",,Anonymous,Romance
"`Feel-good' comedy drama, best for it's brilliant performances.","`Show me the money'. Cameron Crowe's breakout debut is good to say the least. `Jerry Maguire' is a soft-centred, romanticised and rather enjoyable character study of the struggle to return to the top. There's plenty of memorable dialogue along with a biting verbal. It's proud, if not boastful of its sometimes-arrogant style. It works best in its more comedic and satirical moments.The movie opens brilliantly and energetically and draws some modest laughs. However, this unique style is completely abandoned after the first 80 or so minutes and it gradually settles in familiar territory with lightly sentimental drama. The latter plunge isn't a huge mistake. It holds your interest and keeps the same pace, but isn't as good as the poignant first half.The performances are what keeps this film alive and kicking. In an Oscar nominated turn, Tom Cruise loses the ego in one of his best roles to date. He is well suited to the title part and proves to his critics that he's more than just a shallow Hollywood star. Cuba Gooding Jnr. is ecstatic as the egotistical self-worshipping sports star. Renee Zellwegger perfectly balances comedy and drama in a breakthrough role that was done brilliantly. The three leads were enough to hold the film in its place but there's some good (if not irrelevant) support from the likes of Kelly Preston, Jay Mohr, Jerry O'Connell, Bonnie Hunt and a blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo from Eric Stoltz.The script is also very sharp and imaginative and the finished product is better than the sum of its parts. There are some neat touches such as a man-eating divorced women's group and a male jazz obsessed child technician (male nanny). It builds up (perhaps too much) momentum and doesn't know what to do with it so gradually turns into a `too serious' drama at the halfway mark. This is a shame because had it not been for this, then I think it would have lived up to the entirety of its hype.Still though, `Jerry Maguire' is an intentionally inflated, but very enjoyable and very good for what it's worth. My IMDb rating: 6.8/10.",,Anonymous,Romance
a generally likable movie,"Jerry Maguire is a universal favorite, it has good dialouge, good comedy, and some good actors. But when you think about it and put it into perspective there isn't anything thats just absolutely amazing, weird, or different about this film. The acting was excellent from Tom, Renee, and Cuba Gooding Jr. (and Aries Spears) The little kid and Kelly Preston were extremely annoying. I really just had to roll my eyes at the part where Kelly beats up Tom Cruise, I mean - yeah right, like she could actually do that.. That and other moments made this film very un-real and annoying.",,Anonymous,Romance
A horrid film. As phoney as a rubber chicken!,"This movie had so much potential. About the first 25 minutes of this film were classic. But what Hollywood had to do to make it `friendly' for the stupid audience ruined the whole movie.The film focuses on a Sport's Agent, the title character (played by, who else?) who discovers that the players' well being is much better than money. In a very dramatic scene at a hospital, an injured player in bed is manipulated by Cruise to play again very soon. When the player's son tells him his dad is unfit, he does not care about the kid's feelings at all. The boy curses at him, flips him off, and runs out of the scene.He then writes a short composition about his scrupulous beliefs, losing all his team members as a result. That's when the film revolves into an interesting character study to a sentimental and annoying romantic comedy (Remember the nervous breakdown scene in the office?) filled with stereotypes and syrupy dialogue. Oh gosh, a black sports' player, a white agent. What does that make you think?  More annoyance is the fact this movie was nominated for 7 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. My eyebrows lifted when I heard this was a work of Cameron Crowe (of `Fast Times at Ridgemont High' fame.) Renee Zelwegger is beautiful, and a great actress, and never should of been casted in this trite and predictable film.Certainly not as bad as The English Patient in terms of Oscars, but it goes to show that 1996 was just a very bad year for movies.",,Anonymous,Romance
Maybe it was the movie...maybe it was just Tom Cruise...?,"As much as I wanted to like this movie- I couldn't...it was soooo hyped that maybe I was just disappointed by the result. The children are cute...some moments are funny...but there is something about this movie that seems insincere..maybe it's Tom Cruise's acting. Sometimes I really do think that he looks like such a ""pretty boy"" that it takes away from the reality and the truthfulness of the characters he plays. This movie is an example of this. I don't know...something about his performance irked me. Renee Zellweger was great though and so were the kids in the movie and definitely Cuba Gooding was good, but I don't think he deserved an oscar for it. watch it...you just might find it to be entertaining....
