"Slightly updated, partial retelling of Stephen King's massive tome","It's 1988, and a group of young teens in the town of Derry, Maine are terrorized by an otherworldly clown named Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard), who can make them see their worst fears. They must band together to stop the fiend before it kills them all.King's novel succeeded in large part due to the nostalgic immersion into Baby Boomer cultural touchstones. The filmmakers decision to update the setting to the late 1980's is understandable in the sense that the follow-up, featuring the adult versions of the characters, will now chronologically fit with modern times. The filmmakers also decide to forgo any excessive wallowing in 1980's pop iconography, with a movie poster here and a song there the only references. That boils the story down to the horror film essentials, and while there's nothing original in the mix, it is well presented, and features a handful of memorable scare moments. The special effects are also largely successful, and Skarsgard is good as the monstrous clown. The filmmakers also made the interesting decision to not explain Pennywise, perhaps leaving that for the sequel. I'd be curious what a first time viewer, with no knowledge of the source novel or the previous 1990 TV mini-series version, thought of the story.I recently caught up with the first season of the TV series Stranger Things, which almost certainly had some impact on this film version of It, even going so far as to cast one of the show's leads in this as well. That's not a problem, though, as that kid (Wolfhard) is good in both, and the rest of the cast in this is also terrific, with Lillis, as the sole girl in the group, and the aforementioned Wolfhard, as the foul-mouthed jokester, the stand-outs.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A movie's movie - stunningly beautiful, mystical, haunting","I absolutely loved the new 'IT' movie and didn't expect it to be that good. It is a perfectly paced and beautifully shot movie that captures some of the love for 80's horror movies.But 'IT' is actually much more than just a rehash of a plain-old horror movie: The characters are all interesting and the kids' acting skills are surprisingly convincing and moving. You really do feel for them and you want them to succeed, which is really what makes a horror movie be a hit or a flop. The emotional subplots are not too shallow as well—the love story does not feel haphazardly attached onto everything else; the interactions between the characters feel meaningful and real.The new clown is also quite well done with some very creepy acting and a compelling voice. What's more: I didn't even mind the CGI of the horror effects. Usually CGI puts me off, but here, everything was done rather well with some really suspenseful moments.In the end, what really got me to love the new 'IT' is that this is a movie for people who love movies. The cinematography is just like true movie fans like it: Lots of stunning landscape and wide shots, perfect lighting and atmosphere, and on top of that a great score! What do you want more?",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A relentlessly creepy and unsettling ride.,"While it could have used more subtlety in the scare moments, the movie delivers surprising and effectively bizarre set pieces to keep you engaged. The likable and endearing losers group make the film worth watching again long after the fright has worn off. It manages to go from terrifying to hilarious, with Richie smashing it as the comedian of the group. It also touches on deeper themes of the bonds of friendship, the traumas that take our innocence away and the courage we need to face our fears. You won't only be scared, you'll be moved and inspired. Though your opinions on clowns might take a hit.",,Anonymous,Horror
Starts well but gets boring fast once you realise there is no goal,"The opening scene of IT is so promising - well directed, atmospheric, and Skarsgard's clown is compelling to watch. There is a brief moment where while laughing mutually with the kid, the clown suddenly goes quiet and stares menacingly. Its brilliantly unsettling. But sadly, that's it as far as unsettling clown performances go - the rest of the film is typical CGI scares, and the clown throwing out taunts like the deriative satire of Scary Terry in Rick and Morty.The cinematography and acting is great. Its watchable in an afternoon Netflix kind of way. But there is no real gist, goal or drive to the story, it all just sort of unfolds scene after scene, goalless and drifty like the string-along nature of a Police Academy film.Its OK - but it really isn't the classic that people are making out to be. Its been incredibly over-hyped. I personally found Insidious to be a far more effective supernatural chiller.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
An amazing recognition of conquering our inner demons. Especially the ones that held us back as children.,"While 'IT' doesn't compensate the ""scare"" factor that we had hoped for, the film touches on a human level that most modern horror films can't. 'IT' should be watched more as a Dramatic Thriller. The extra time the film takes establishing stong character develpoment allows the audience to connect to their true questioning of what really scares them and why haven't they confronted 'IT'.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
I prefer the original IT film to this remake,"I love horror and I loved Stephen King's original IT film. I wanted to really love this movie, but I just wasn't feeling it. I think I watched 75% of it then got bored and never finished. (I'm watching this as a rental, though, so I may finish it tonight). It was a little bit different than the original...they added dialogue for the kids that was more ""current' so they brought up references to sex more...which in my opinion added nothing to the movie. There was more special effects and a bit more gore...I don't think these added anything to the movie either.The clown didn't really scare me. I thought some of the scenes with the clown were just weird and over done. I'm disappointed. I'll give it a 6, though, because it wasn't an awful movie...it just didn't live up to my expectations.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not at all the type of film I usually watch...but I did enjoy it and am glad I saw it.,"Of all the different genres of films, I think modern horror is probably my least favorite. I love old horror films...mostly because they aren't extremely graphic and leave a lot to the imagination. But this is a case which proves I can be won over by a violent modern horror pic. The only reason I saw this one at all is because my daughter wanted to see it...and I didn't wanna disappoint her.I am not going to make this review long...as there are nearly 800 for this hit film already. Suffice to say, the movie is scary, the story very good (the things omitted from the book are generally best not being in the film) and I enjoyed the heck out of the picture. Who knows...maybe I don't hate the genre...just the brainless teens begin slaughtered at the abandoned amusement park/roller disco by a guy in a hockey mask sort of film.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A decent next attempt at IT,"This 2017 production of Stephen King's book is a well-crafted, decently acted imagining of the story. I really enjoyed it but did speak to some people who were disappointed that it had diverged from the book too much.In brief, the children of Derry are going missing at an alarming rate. Something evil lurks in the town and it's up to the Loser's Club to overcome their fear and unite to confront IT ...I found the old TV movie somewhat dull in the second half. The first half, which this movie is concerned with, was always the stronger half and I think this version is probably just as good, if not better than the original TV movie. It's certainly more gruesome and scary.I'm not sure Tim Curry's Pennywise has been upstaged though. Bill Skarsgard has done a good job but I think Curry's is hard to beat.IT 2017 is refreshingly old-school, in that it focuses on character and story, unlike too many recent ""horror"" movies. It is beautifully shot and superbly acted but perhaps could move at a slightly better pace.IT will divide opinions due to story vs screenplay issues but it's definitely not a bad remake.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better for Younger,"For a younger audience, unjaded by so many horror and suspense flicks, this movie will probably be creepier. This version of the story is somewhat a victim of itself. So many derivatives have occurred over the years, many from King novels, including this one, that this remake suffers as somewhat less of the same. At my 55 years of age, it just never hit a fear climax. Sure, some great scenes, just not enough impact. For the younger audience, I expect it would be great. Also, perhaps by the edit- down for the screen play, the story seemed to leave a lot of plot holes uncompleted, and seemed to violate its own plane of existence. Appropriate for Netflix, or a young couple on a date.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Terrifyingly brilliant. You'll float too.,"What persuaded me to watch this movie was the blessing bestowed upon it by the stories original creator, Stephen King, who claimed: ""I wasn't prepared for how good it really was"".He's not wrong.""IT"" is quite extraordinary. The attention to detail, the subtle but effective comedic undertone and the exquisite cinematography not only do the original title proud, they make this re-imagining of the original classic even better than its predecessor.It's a very scary film but what impressed me was how true the film sticks to the original's tricks; it isn't filled with loud in-your-face jump scares, in fact, a lot of what makes this film scary is the slick cinematography and intricate shadow play. The use of lighting and creation of atmosphere is what makes this film so tense, which is why it's perfectly suited for those who like Horror movies but without the obnoxious gore.Watched the pre-release as a critic - August 28th.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
light on scares,"So I went and saw IT, and came back unimpressed. I mean it was a good movie, no doubt about that. A bunch of kids, outcasts in their own right, being terrorized by an ancient demon that plays upon the fears of its victims is pretty much the standard in Hollywood horror movie territory. All the kids are well cast, the script is funny and tight, and there are plenty of monster shots. The cinematography is great, the pace is even and the CGI is flawless. But is more funny than terrifying- it's R rating more a justification of teenage slang in the script, rather than for true scares.But that is what typically Stephen King is all about. His stories are studies on relationships rather than all out horror. In IT, King reversed Spielberg's E.T, and explored everyday monsters of childhood- abuse, violence and neglect. Juxtapose that with an eternal evil shape-shifting entity who wakes up every 27 years to prey, and you have a shawarma of a plot. The book is scary, the movie isn't. Probably so because today, we are used to Stranger Things.We are used to kids doing stupendous stuff these days- whether running billion dollar companies, or bringing back lost souls from other dimensions. It all seems very easy for today's generation to figure things out- most of IT establishes this narrative. A wonderful group of actors face off against Bill Skarsgard's Pennywise the Dancing Clown, and they all nail their parts. The movie takes place in a town where all the adults are essentially villains- so its not just the kids versus the clowns everyone else. But for sheer impact, IT never reaches the highs it achieves in its first sequence.It is a great example of how strong marketing can make mediocre movies look a billion bucks. Other reviewers are putting IT right up there with other Stephen King adaptions such as The Shining and The Thing. Oh please, that would be laying it too thick. Director Andy Muschietti's earlier take on the genre- Mama, is a far better contender.No good horror movie can get away by being light on scares, however good the characters and the script are. So look at IT as an extension of Goonies or Stranger Things, a PG-13 romp, not an iconic horror movie. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Some Great Stuff But Also Some Flaws,"It (2017)*** (out of 4)A small town has a strange history with various disasters that strike every twenty-seven years and more times than not it's children that are harmed. One summer a group of friends realize that they are all being stalked by the vision of a sinister clown known as Pennywise. They soon realize that if they don't try to kill it then he will kill them one by one.Stephen King's IT was originally made for television in 1990 and it was a hugely successful film that scared the crap out of people. The film had all sorts of hype going into it and it actually lived up to it. The film carried on a cult following for years and then news broke that a new adaptation was coming. This film really try to create the same type of hype and it ended up being a massive box office hit. People were eating it up and it's easy to see why. With that said, as much as I loved certain parts of it there's no question that there are some major flaws as well.The great stuff includes the drama aspect of the story. The real terror comes from the bullying, the girl's sexual abuse by her father, the blame you place on yourself for your brother's death and of course there's the building of friendships that kids do during the summer. All of this is perfectly done and director Andy Muschietti does a wonderful job with the development of the characters. He also does a terrific job at capturing the mood and setting of a small town. The 1988/89 settings were perfectly captured and you can sit there and feel that you're in a real town with real characters.All of the performances by the kids are simply wonderful with Sophia Lillis and Jeremy Ray Taylor really standing out. The adult performances are just as great even though they're all basically small supporting roles. Tehn there's Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise. I thought the actor was terrific in the park and I enjoyed how much more sinister this clown was. I also loved the line delivery and thought the actor was terrific at bringing this character to the screen.With that said, there are some major, major flaws that pretty much kill the horror elements of the film and that's the CGI. The CGI effects are so fake looking that I couldn't help but be taken out of the drama that was going on. This isn't a Marvel movie or some sort of fantasy. Why build up the setting so much just to throw it all away with cheap effects? And I ask you this.... Was this CGI, fake looking clown that rushes towards the camera or floats around really as creepy as the actor and his make-up? Why they had to throw these cheap, fake looking effects is anyone's guess but it really hurts the film.Overall, I'd say that the original was better but there's still a lot of great stuff here. It's really too bad that there really aren't any scares due to the fake looking effects and it's even worse that everything was there for a much better movie. As it stands, IT is good but not a classic.",,Anonymous,Horror
Entertaining but could've been better,"It (2017) was a pretty good movie overall, most of it was entertaining and well made. I will say that it wasn't as good as I expected, there were parts that could have been better. Well first the positives. One of the positives is the acting, great performances were given by all, I was impressed by the child actors, clearly very talented. I think the child actors really committed and showed the level of talent that you'd usually see in an adult actor. The special effects were also very well done. Pennywise's look was well put together and all the wild effects with him looked good. The beginning sequence was very well done, I loved the exchange between Pennywise and Georgie. The middle part of the film was alright, it had good acting and it set up everything for the finale, but to be honest, the beginning and the end were great, very well done, and I felt like the middle portion was alright, but my mind wondered some and I just felt like there wasn't enough substance to the middle part of the movie. Yes, the characters were good and the acting was still good in the middle, but I feel like the story needed more support in that section. I haven't seen the original Tim Curry It miniseries yet, so I cannot compare the two, all I know is that the original is basically like two films in one. I am excited for an It 2, which I feel is on its way since the original had two parts to it. All in all, a 7/10. Overall enjoyable, and I was entertained by the end of it, even though there were places in the movie that could've been better.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"It is pretty good, but a bit too conventional","It is a new adaptation of Stephen King's novel of the same name about a mysterious entity that shows up every 27 years to feed on children. Sometimes in the form of something they are most afraid off and sometimes just in the form of the clown and then this group of kids tries to put an end to the whole thing.I had extremely high expectations that only increased when I heard about all the great reviews. And it's by no means a bad movie, but it certainly is a bit of a disappointment. The story isn't very faithful to the book, but it mostly keeps to the spirit of the novel and contains the essential elements. Adapting that book onto the screen is no easy job, so I'm gonna be a bit forgiving. One thing this movie nailed though is the characters. That's the best thing about this movie. The characters and the performances. Every member of The Losers Club has their own personality and everyone stands out. But still, not entirely (Mike was very underdeveloped). Still, everyone shines in their roles. And Bill Skarsgård is incredible as Pennywise. He's not always terrifying, but he did a fantastic job. I thought both him and Tim Curry in the 1990 TV miniseries were great in their own ways. And they both fit their versions perfectly. Since 1990 version is more of a fun Halloween movie, Curry is a lighter and sillier spin on the character. But this version is darker and creepier, and so is Skarsgård's Pennywise. The characters are a joy to watch, they absolutely nailed that aspect of adapting. And, as I said, it's not easy to adapt this book. But I think they were playing a bit too safe here.The cosmic horror aspect of the book was one of the most fascinating and terrifying to me, so I was really wondering how they would translate that to a movie. The problem is, they didn't even try. And that's why it feels a bit too ordinary and conventional. If that part was done right, it would have been amazing. Maybe they are saving that for the second part of the story, who knows? In case you didn't know this was only half of the story and the book has a part when they are kids and when they are all grown up, 27 years later. I hope they are saving more mature and creepy parts for the sequel. Also, I was very disappointed by the horror aspect as a whole. The opening scene was very disturbing and creepy, but the movie just doesn't retain that atmosphere. I wanted this movie to get under my skin and give me shivers, but you just don't really feel that sense of dread. You've got some fun scenes with jump-scares, but it's never really as terrifying as I expected it to be. And something the director doesn't realize (same mistake can also be seen in his previous film, Mama) is that the more you show the monster, less scary it becomes. And Pennywise is shown way too much. He's creepy at the beginning, but eventually becomes just fun to watch. And that's not really a good thing for a horror movie.But nevertheless, this is still a fun and enjoyable movie that I will definitely be coming back to. They got most of the characters, themes and story on point, but the scares are where this movie really disappoints. What was supposes to be a unique, refreshing and terrifying experience turns into a fun (at times laugh-out-loud funny), but too ordinary and conventional experience. Still, I had a good time and will be coming back to it. It just wasn't what I expected.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Genuinely terrifying,"Just got out of the new IT movie and I utterly thought it was spine-chilling! I'll have to give as much credit to the cast, direction, cinematography and musical score for what made this film all that worthwhile. There's plentiful scares often at a nightmarish level and most certainly, I have to agree with the critics that this movie is an immense improvement over the TV-miniseries - which can be seen as tame by today's standards.

Great horror film from the classic mini series,"The movie was amazing. A couple of friends told me they were disappointed after watching it but after reading the reviews, I knew it would be a great film to watch. All around, the acting was great.

The mass amount of hype made this a let down,"When I heard all the talk of the new movie, It, I was nothing but excited to see what the film had in store. Unfortunately, the movie didn't quite live up to the hype. There were many amazing scenes throughout the film, with top notch music, creepy moments, and surprisingly good child actors.I think the downfall lies in the lack of scare factor, the run time, and the mass amounts of comedy. I have no issue with comedy in a horror movie, but when the movie is over 2 hours long and 60% is comedy, I start to wonder where the scares are. I found myself laughing in scenes that were supposed to be serious due to characters trying to throw in ""just one more joke"" which began to wear on me.It's a good movie and should definitely worth the watch if you were a fan of the original or just looking for a new horror flick.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"If you come with me, you'll float too.","I managed to win a preview screening to 'IT' on the 30th of August, in Sydney. I had high expectations for this film - and IT exceeded them.The acting. Great performances all round. The kids had great chemistry, and you really believe that they were all great friends. It reminded me of Stand By Me and The Goonies. Out of the child actors, Richie (played by Finn Wolfhard) was my favourite and his jokes cracked the whole cinema up. Bill Skarsgård as Pennywise is scary and really creeped me out, but for me there was just something missing about his character and I think he wasn't given enough dialogue.A minor flaw for me was that the plot was a bit rushed, in terms with the development of Mike (played by Chosen Jacobs), but for an adaption from a book, they managed to condense the original material very well.Overall, it (no pun intended) was a great thriller film that kept me on the edge of my seat, with strong performances.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""It"" shows flare, but needs to have more confidence in it's ability to scare.","""It"" is a mostly successful horror film that, unlike it's peers, manages to easily surpass the quality of it's predecessor (although it did have a slight luxury in being a remake of a TV film). Surprisingly enough, the film's biggest issue arises in the confidence of the film to allow itself to scare the audience.Fortunately the film manages to stay standing in spite of itself. A large part of this is due to the casting of the child actors and the antagonist, Pennywise. For the most part these kids are believable in their roles even when they have to read through some clunky King dialogue. Only a few times do their performances feel hammy, the most notable being a painful but short exchange between Ben and Bev during the third act. The kids also play the comic relief of the film well in their dialogue. Although the film does push the comedic limit sometimes, especially a bit that referenced 'New Kids on the Block' that felt like it belonged in a tripe PG-13 comedy. Otherwise the only other shortcoming in the characters is the criminally underwritten role of Mike. I feel for Chosen Jacobs who did really well with what sparse material they gave that character.I can't really add anything about Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise, it's everything that it's been built up to be.I also appreciated that the film had some cinematic shots as well. Too often directors in horror forget how crucial framing a shot can be. Fortunately ""It"" does not forget this and I actually remembered a few specific shots the day after watching the film. One particular shot I enjoyed was a dutch angle shot from the perspective of a painting, the character in the frame straightens the literal frame and by extension the actual shot as well.While I praise the film for those shots, I have to acknowledge the gigantic pitfall of the film.Obnoxiously loud stings during every single scare.""It"" is filled with many disturbing and scary visuals. However, the film insults your intelligence by fishing for a jump scares with abhorrent sound cues. So much more could've been accomplished with appropriate ambient music, or sounds to really let the fear and unease creep into the audience instead of essentially yelling ""Boo!"". This was very unfortunate as even in a theatre with a full audience, only once did a single person scream during the entire film.Jump scares aren't uncommon in horror, but this film was strong enough to stand on it's own without resorting to such trite measures.As a result the film finds itself being just good, instead of great.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The perfect blend of comedy and horror,"Having not seen the original movie and only tidbits of the trailer, I didn't really know what to expect when walking into the cinema this evening. Someone described the movie as 'The Goonies' meets 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' - this turned out to be an extremely accurate description!The opening scene seems to suggest that the movie will be very dark, yet these expectations are quickly dispersed as the horror is undercut by comedy. This happens repeatedly throughout the film: and it works. My friends and I (as well as the entire packed cinema) found ourselves gasping at scenes of sheer terror, then only moments later laughing hysterically at the banter between the main characters.I would say that this is not a film for the faint of heart, yet I think even those individuals would find themselves enjoying 'It'. If not for the horror, then certainly for the comedy and camaraderie. It's as if this is a movie within a movie: a mix of a high-school-problems/coming-of-age movie and a horror. A brilliant two-for-one if you ask me!Great acting from all of the cast as well as excellent writing make this movie a must watch!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"It: Not as bad as I expected, not as good as they say","Remakes/reboots are a plenty at the moment and I'm ""That"" guy who gets angry whenever a new one is announced and It was no exception so naturally I went in expecting the worst.Some remakes are direct scene for scene while others take the concept but go into business for themselves. It does a combination and for the most part it works.With a solid Stand By Me (1986) vibe and turning the tale into a two parter we see the Losers club battle Pennywise The Clown and it turned over a nice profit at the box office and was met with critical acclaim.I as expected do not understand the hype and am certainly not onboard but even I can't dispute that there are some real successes here.It looks great, its well written and the young cast do a brilliant job. As for Bill Skarsgård I have to say, meh. It's not that he did a bad job, he's just performing in the shadow of someone better.I'm a Stephen King fanboy at heart and I love both his works and most of the movie adaptations so I'm happy to see that this isn't a black mark on his record but do not want to see anymore remade.Credit where credit is due, this is a well made feature but flawed in places and simply shouldn't have been made in the first place.The Good:Looks greatThe Bad:Yet another unneeded remakeSome weak momentsThings I Learnt From This Movie:The Jewish cap also makes a great frisbeeThe writers took floating too literallyClearly the rumours were correct, two boys in one film!

The IT Factor,"I had the pleasure of seeing an advanced screening of IT in Brisbane. The film is absolutely brilliant. Bill Skarsgård has taken Pennywise and made the role his own.

All actors really held their own, creating a sense of comradery between the characters.Like most people, I do hold the miniseries with Tim Curry close to my heart, but after seeing this adaptation, I was beyond pleasantly surprised.

Decent and enjoyable,"It was not a bad film and not as scary as expected but with horror films its the anticipation that is nerve wrecking and It had plenty of that. The comedy worked surprisingly well given its morbid nature. It also peaked everyone's interest. If you can get over the obvious flaws such as kids being able to be kidnapped and killed by a clown every 27 years without being found out its a decent film. The kids of this film did a great job and showcased their fear quite well.

An honest review from a 40+ guy who read the book,"Really liked it, but it's not perfect.Hard to judge how much of the liking is because of the 80:s (like Stranger Things) nostalgia, but it's far from all of it.+ Kids act great, especially ""Ben Hanscom"". Good touch and psychology in the coming of age scenes. Dark and serious social stuff in between the jump scares. Like most Steven King stories, the best parts are in between the horrors. As a member of my own hometown's ""loser club"", as a kid, I really felt like I was one or all of the protagonists. The film has a good heart. Pennywise is a great mix of a powerful, psychopathic, godlike entity, and a playful kid. Scary and sad at the same time. Music is good too.The pacing feels rushed, scenes are stacked on top of each other in a ""too fast"" tempo, just to stay true to the book. We don't have enough time to really get to know our young heroes. I feel this movie could really have benefited from being 30-45 minutes longer, or even better, a 5-10 hour TV series.I think this story is hard to do justice in 2 hours of film, but it does a good job, the visuals are also great. Art direction and all.Overall: Way, way better than the weirdly over appreciated 90:s TV series. I saw that as a teenager, who really looked forward to it as well. It sucked then, and it sucks now. Don't understand how that production was ever talked about by fans. Tim Curry might have been OK, but the dialogue, makeup, production value, and acting (except the kids) was horrible.This adaptation is 10 times better. Recommend it, if you like this sort of stuff.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great coming-of-age film, terrible horror movie.","I went into this totally fresh, having never read the book nor seen the original (despite watching horror films for over 30 years).As a horror movie, I thought it was poor. I didn't find a single scene or shot the least bit scary. I thought the intro scene was interesting, and I was definitely intrigued by the appearance of Pennywise who had a welcoming creepiness about him... but this was totally lost in all of his subsequent scenes for me. I found most scenes where Pennywise was shaking and screaming to be borderline laughable. Every jump scare was clichéd to the point of predictability (not a single one landed for me), and I never once felt any sense of dread (and sadly, I never got a single spine shiver, which is what I seek when watching a scary movie). Although it featured gore, as a horror/scary movie... it completely failed. (The only scene I found suitably creepy was the old woman out of focus in the background in the library!)But... aside from the horror elements, I actually found the human characters to be quite interesting and very entertaining. I think the boys (and Bev) were perfectly cast, and they were each interesting in their own arcs. The witty banter was immensely entertaining, and felt very natural... this was largely what kept me interested throughout an otherwise dull horror film. I also thought the 80's setting was handled quite well... certainly giving a feel of the era without ramming it down our throats, and the character sensibilities felt true to that period also. So... as a horror film, for me it totally fails... but as an 80's coming-of-age drama, I actually quite enjoyed it!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Beautifully Balanced Vision Of A Classic,"First - this review is not of the remedial variety; the classic numbnut 'It didunt scayer me as a munched mu popcurn'.There's a ton of them out there sapping my will to live.I've read the book on three occasions since 1987. The 1990 mini-series was a frustrating, strangled attempt to get IT onto some kind of live action format. Memorable, yes - and only - for Tim Curry's Pennywise.Stephen King unwittingly created a cultural landmark, and did more to demonise clowns than John Wayne Gacy.My heart sank when this reboot of IT was announced. How do you present a consumable version of a tale so embedded in cultural subconscious, a villainous killer-clown theme so worn by terrible Z-movie clichés? How do you engage indifferent VOD generations who have seen it all, or at least believe they have? Who have experienced every trick in the cinematic horror-book? Well, you get as clever as Andy Muschetti and his production team and you build it from the solid foundations-up.They got back to the classic tale; took the spirit of the book and made sure it's prevalent in every scene, even in the new added invention that throws us some original, beautifully constructed moments.And right the way through we got raucous adventure, grisly horror, tension, and tragedy.You're never a few moments away from being reminded this is a tale that revolves around the loss of a murdered little brother, and a dark history of smalltown evil. There's a gravity to the story that grounds it constantly, and also makes it more compelling because this is the everyday evil you just didn't notice...You're also never more than moments away from laughing out loud or gritting your teeth, or a shiver running down the spine.The balance is great.My only contention - the running time. But that's restricted by budget and studio expectations. There's so much more they could have told but what they did for 2 hours 10 minutes and $35 million is remarkable, particularly to a long-time fan of the epic novel.Pennywise - well, terrific. More villain than vaudeville, more sinister than silly. Bill Skaarsgard will be very popular at his family's children's birthday parties in the years to come. Or maybe not...I loved this incarnation of the killer clown as opposed to Curry's; as much a Heath Ledger Joker to Nicholson's. Captivating, and both amusing and horrific.Overall, IT is more thrilling than frightening, and that's no bad thing; there are dimensions to this film that elevate it above the worn tropes of desperate 'horror' directors.You could say IT floats.I cannot wait to see the second chapter; I expect the adult timeline to be very, very dark indeed compared to this hugely entertaining Goonies v Kruger romp.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Take the boat, Georgie!","The brand new #ITMovie scared the heck out of me and I don't throw that around loosely because just when you thought that ""Annabelle: Creation"" may have set the bar for this year, bam! ""IT"" comes along and smashes that bar into pieces. Wow! This is one incredible horror film, everybody involved should get a congratulatory pat on the back, definitely a huge upgrade from the '90s miniseries. This is best Stephen king adaptation yet.Directed by Andy Muschietti, based on Stephen King's timeless novel of the same name, IT is set around the mysterious disappearance of children in Derry Maine, when a group of young kids will have to come face their biggest fears and square off against an eternal evil clown named Pennywise who comes around every 27 years to repeat his reign of terror.It's no secret and it's not really a spoiler that New Line and the filmmakers of this new version have planned to re-imagine this story into two installments, with the first focusing on the children and then chapter two will be about their grown up selves once again battling Pennywise. So with this first chapter, I think the timing of its arrival couldn't be more perfect especially with last year's debut of the hugely popular series, ""Stranger Things"" that brings up '80s childhood nostalgia while presenting mystery at the same time, ""IT"" offers you that same vein and I think that's OK because we haven't gotten to the point where it's played out so for the time being you're going to love that aspect about ""IT."" There's definitely a ""Stand By Me"" vibe to it as well, and the whole thing does feel episodic, at one point while screening it I didn't want it to end, it felt like I was binge-watching, it was so cool. Kudos to all the young actors featured in this film, they really hold their own and each of their characters' distinct personalities stand out. Their backstories and their process of slowly but surely coming together as some sort of a team is both honest and engaging.Now, if you've ever read Stephen King's book, ""IT,"" you'd recall that it is a super duper thick book. You can use it as a stool to stand on for when you need to change that lightbulb. But the point is, I think the screenwriters of this new film did well in condensing the story to just the right amount of time that contains just the right mix of kids camaraderie and the horror fest that is Pennywise. And if you've watched the '90s miniseries, you'd recall how much that version held back plus the low quality practical effects that they had at the time. Well, I'm happy to tell you that this new ""IT"" doesn't hold back, this is Pennywise unleashed, it's practically proud of being R-rated, which is great because it allows for the scary parts to be really really scary and not second-guessing or pandering.And if you have never liked clowns before, you're going to hate clowns even more because Bill Skarsgard's performance as the new Pennywise will haunt your dreams for the next few weeks after you've watched this movie. What I appreciate about Skarsgard is that he doesn't try too hard to emulate or imitate or channel Tim Curry, Skarsgard does his own take of creepy. And because Pennywise is pretty much invincible to a certain extent, you'll see him pop up in the most unlikeliest of places meaning when you least expect him, that's when he'll scare you to your core so brace yourselves for surprises around every corner. Another reason why the timing of this movie's arrival could not be more perfect is because today's visual effects compliment Pennywise's limitless abilities and so director Andy Muschietti and his crew have the creative freedom to not only realize some of the scare points in the book but they managed to also go beyond that. ""IT"" goes for massive, it goes for bold, it goes for bloody, not a single boring minute, it goes for the ""Goonies"" fan in all of us. You will laugh, you will scream, you will have nightmares, hands down one of the best horror movies ever made.-- Rama's Screen --",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
New season of Stranger Things started good,"Well the movie is quite good overall.Great acting , scenes ans music. It's a great remake of the classic. What threw me off was the fact that it looks so much as the series Stranger Things.For some unknown reason directors decided to include way too much ''funny lines'' and jokes to the point yo forget you are watching a horror movie.Nothing like the original IT unsettling atmosphere. This along with how the whole town didn't giving a tiny rats ass about kids being bullied to death literally makes 2 big problems for me. In the theater i swear there were more laughs than scares. Less jokes and less Stranger Things atmosphere would be better for me.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
IT (2017) Review,"Great horror films are rare these days mainly because most of them are redundant sequels and remakes that do very little to aid the story or the scares. Even though this 2017 version of IT is a remake of the Stephen King classic, it is one of the best horror films I have seen in a long time. With killer clowns, death of children and monsters attacking you left and right, what's not to love? The film follows the same plot as the massive first part of the classic 1986 novel with the second half to be finished in a sequel. Seven children are being hunted and prayed on by a child-eating alien disguised as a clown known as Pennywise for each of their own fears and traumas. One child in particular, Bill Denbrough (Jayden Lieberher) is obsessed with founding and defeating the clown because he believes he will also find his younger brother who was captured by the alien months earlier with many believing him to be dead.  This makes us connect emotionally with Bill as well as the other characters who have fears of their own such as Beverly Marsh (Sophia Lillis) the only female of the group who is sexually abused by her father. This formula can be repetitive but it is terrifying when each child has their own encounter with Pennywise. Cinematography is also to great effect in IT. Camera movement gets incredibly shaky during intense chase scenes but the camera also takes the time to slow down to explore the emotionally levity of some scenes. Shadows are used effectively to add to the sinister nature of the film like the sewer locations where the unknown evil of Pennywise lurk. The actors of the children also act well in their current surroundings and reasonably act like coming of age children. Bill as mentioned earlier is obsessed with finding IT and his younger brother and due to his young age acts impulsively without much consideration of his actions or his friends like any coming of age child would. CGI can look pretty suspect in a few scenes with Pennywise. When he starts attacking, he does these really forced shaky motions that can take away from the scene a little bit, but not enough to ruin the horror and tension of the scenes. For any horror fan, IT is an absolute must see, especially in the dark of the cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
It was good,It was a well produced and filmed horror film compared to the rest of the genre. The story itself is too chaotic and random for me at times but at its core it's really enjoyable.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
I really felt like i was part of the losers club.,"OK, so i just saw the IT movie and IT was pretty great (pun intended). This is a movie i was (of course) waiting for quite some time to be honest. It is overall a very OK shot movie, with some takes and planes that really stood out. The cinematography wasn't something particularly different from other films of the genre, but i allow myself to say that it was pretty decent and i really can't complain.One of the things this movie will probably be most remembered for are the casting choices and the lead children's performances. It is hands down the best feature of the film. Seeing how every single kid gave and amazing performance was not only the base of the idea this movie was intending for, but a pretty refreshing situation that i was really enjoying watching at the big screen. I have hardly no complaints regarding the kids except for maybe one or two brief moments that it drop down a little.However, have that being said it wasn't a flawless movie. I do have some issues with one of the antagonistic forces of the films known as 'the bully' Henry Bowers. He isn't actually mentioned once as a ""bully"" but the reality is that his character is so poorly fleshed out that calling him ""the main bully"" basically summons up his entirely personality. The movie tried to give a compelling backstory to make the audience care for him but it really didn't do much.My last point that i want to explain is that even though the performance of Bill Skarsgård's Pennywise was very good and fit his character perfectly, the decisions made regarding the approach of how the film was going to deal with the character ultimately made a good antagonist but it sacrificed the Horror theme of the movie almost completely.Overall a film that when i finish watching i was eager to see again, and i will rate this one a 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
exciting although surprisingly un-scary,"Like the miniseries Stranger Things, It hearkens back to 80s filmmaking, falling somewhere between Stand By Me and Poltergeist. While ostensibly a horror movie, in spirit it is more a coming-of-age drama with a monster.The movie is not particularly scary, even by Poltergeist standards, but it is quite exciting, particularly in the final, thrilling confrontation. The movie also does a lovely job of reminding us that not all evil dwells in the sewer, with some of the most disturbing scenes being purely human; I was ultimately more scared of Bev's father than of Pennywise.The kid's are all excellent. I like how little they fit to typical stereotypes; the stuttering kid is the brave one, the kid with glasses is a sex hound rather than a nerd, and the chubby kid is a scholar.I don't have strong feelings about Pennywise. He is probably most effective in that first disturbing scene, but unfortunately I had already seen the SNL/Kellyanne Conway parody of that scene which was so dead-on that it impacted how seriously I could take the movie Pennywise (it's not the movie's fault, of course, that Kate MacKinnon captured the role so well). The actor doesn't have as strong a personality as Tim Curry did in the previous version of It, and ultimately seems like more a vehicle for evil rather than a distinct character.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Everything is great but CGI,"I loved the clown acting, the kids were perfect, music was good too, I liked the photography, everything was well directed and the story was well portrayed. This movie was almost perfect, but the scary scenes were a failure due to CGI. most of the time CGI in horror films does not work to scare people, and this time was not the exception, CGI looks cheap and most of the time it is not needed at all.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Modern Day Horror at its finest,"IT is masterfully put together. The horror beats are creatively crafted and hit every time. There is a good amount of humor coming mostly from the supporting characters. Amazing visuals, great music, and a great pennywise performance make this a modern day horror classic.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Stephen King's IT As A Generation X Period Piece,"This movie is more of a period piece about what life was like for many kids in Generation X, which really is it's own ""horror story"". There is so much negativity and despair without the presence of IT, that IT really only serves as a cherry on top of an already deflated childhood experience.Since the story is more focused on the kids, they are seen much more in this film than IT/Pennywise is. The kids do a decent acting job, they're not awful or ""unbelievable"" but they definitely weren't trying to win any acting awards in their performances either - except for the kid who plays Eddie Kaspbrak, who does an outstanding job that goes above and beyond all of his peers in this film. This cast of kids didn't have the same chemistry in this film as those in the original and these kids were certainly less charismatic overall than their previous counterparts.The single most disappointing aspect of this film is IT/Pennywise. Even if we pretend that Tim Curry's performance doesn't exist - which blows Skarsgard's performance out of the water, it doesn't change that this performance was not frightening, compelling or memorable.Underwhelming and not very frightening as this film leans more on cliché ""jump scares"" rather than building any kind of real suspense or dread about the character.Overall, the film serves as a great representation of Generation X's childhood, as well as representing Boomers and Silent Generationers during this time. The Boomer parents are mostly absent, abusive, overbearing and/or blame the Gen. X kids for perceived problems in their eyes. The Silent Generationers are tough, wise and politically incorrect.Unfortunately, part of the trouble of this film was it's goal to serve 2 Gods: Telling a story about Generation X as well as telling the story of Stephen King's IT. The result was that neither story was able to reach their full potential and the intertwining added a bit of confusion/inconsistency.While it was very interesting to place this film in the 1980s and added something new and creative to the story, it also took quite a bit away from the original story and fear of IT, itself.Overall, this was an interesting take on IT if it took place in the 1980s as opposed to the 1950s - and worth seeing for that reason, but it clearly didn't reach it's full potential and therefore was more underwhelming than it was impressive. Not nearly as rewatchable as the 90s mini-series.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great Storyline,Great story and captured the audience to follow with each character someone everyone can relate with as a kid. I haven't seen a thriller/horror movie in a long time and I have no clue what possessed me to watch this one. Overall it was worth it! Reminds me a lot of the Goonies. I would definitely recommend watching this one.,9.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Good Remake,"Remakes are usually the dumbest way to explore the success of a great film. However, ""It"" (2017) is not a bad movie; indeed it is a good remake of the first part of the original ""It"". The storyline is the same but the screenplay was rewritten. In the original film, the seven lead characters are adults meeting each other in Derry. Their childhood is told through flashbacks where the viewer learns their experience with the evil Pennywise when they were children and their pact to return to their hometown if necessary. ""It"" (2017) is linear and tells the same story of the seven bullied children since the disappearance of Georgie, ending with their pact to return to Derry. Now there will certainly be another ""It"" with these characters adult. Sophia Lillis, Jaeden Lieberher and Bill Skarsgård have extraordinary performances. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""It: A Coisa"" (""It: The Thing"")",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The best King adaptation of the year (which isn't saying much),"There are different approaches and styles of storytelling but I have always thought that bestselling novelist Stephen King has a good grip over the most effective one of them. He has the image of horror master but his stories offer actually much more than quick thrills. You possibly couldn't churn out up to 1100 page opuses based on just thrills, could you? King's focus is always on careful character and world building because why would one want to just follow a bunch of events if one didn't care about the people in the story and what's happening to them. And he's usually scarily efficient at creating characters that we want to form emotional connections to. I have read most of King's 57 novels by now, and I am often hooked already on the first page, or maybe the second. The careful character and world building doesn't just happen at once, it takes time and room. This is one of the main reasons why most of King's adaptations are not great ones. There is no way to compress hundreds of pages into a screen story lasting about two hours. Take IT"", for example. In an original novel, there's more than 1100 pages. As a movie, it runs 135 minutes, including end credits. There was never gonna be a chance to see more than main events on screen, not to mention Hollywood's nasty way of often taking a famed literary work of fiction and throwing out almost everything but the main plot points and character names. I read IT"" more than ten years ago, so I don't remember it all that well, but the movie version feels... right. They have taken the best of both worlds: sweet nostalgia-tinged coming of age story as a backbone and the horrors served in short intervals aside. Both aspects work well, neither feels fresh but they are effective. Coming of age story resembles 1986's Stand by Me"", one of the most acclaimed King adaptation of all time. Horrors are created the cheap way, that is to say, mostly by editing and sudden creepy music or sound effects. Nothing essentially wrong with that, most horror movies do the same and they still have plenty of fans. I myself have quite tired of this and would have preferred slow and creepy building of suspense – this would have fit more closely with King's original work too – but whatever. The problem me is that there's just too many horror"" moments, after one hour it's starting to feel like a carnival show. One has to be a true horror fan to not feel exhaustion before the end, or possibly reaching the middle of the story. Two-plus hours is a long way to watch somebody attacked over and over again by the same two or three evil creatures. I mean, I like Pennywise and his crew as much as anybody but there's only so much times it feels cool to see some monster suddenly jump out from somewhere and say ""boo"". I was quite curious about how the adaptation would solve"" this famous sex scene from the original novel. There's probably no tasteful way to offer it in mainstream movie, so they have opted to not use it all. Wise choice. King should have left it out in the book, too. So. For a horror movie, IT"" is good enough if overly ready to use the same couple of tricks over and over again. For a movie inspired by King's work, it's also good enough, giving you the simple but clear taste of what the bestselling master is possibly about. For a King adaptation, it's mediocre as most of them, setting the bar too low to start with. So, you just have to go catch it and see whether you'll float too. There's a possibility of part two although it's hard to tell how concrete this is. Probably depends on the box office success. The movie ends the same way as the novel, which means there The young actors in part 1 are good, by the way.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A killer clown awakens from his twenty seven year sleep to terrorize the kid of Derry.,The acting over all was really good but i wish they hadn't marketed it as so scary you wont sleep for months. When going into this i thought i was gonna get a really good scare but in all reality i found that it would work better as a dark comedy instead. However there was a few good jump scares but i found that sometimes the CGI looked weird. There was some hidden gestures to characters and scenes from the book but in all they left a lot of the book out. Im hoping for more of parts from the book in chapter two of the movie.,8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Getting there guys,"I remember when ""It"" came out in 1990. It was something special and is probably the number one cause of people being afraid of clowns now. Not that I get why you would be afraid of clowns though, but my wife is, so to me it's funny to watch her being scared. Is this version from 2017 better than it's predecessor? I would definitely say yes. The story is the same but the make-up and special effects are creepier. But nothing beats the book though. And that's for almost all the movies taken from books. Aspecially the ones from Stephen King. Most of his books are way better than their movie adaptations. ""It"" isn't an exception. But the movie is certainly worth a watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Refreshing movie released just in the right time,"I believe many people are going to agree with me if I assert that It Follows, The Babadook and 'It' are maybe the best horror movies in the past several years. First two were dealing with pretty difficult subjects and were shot in low contrast setting. 'It' comes as refreshing. This movie can best be described as one long child nightmare filled with fantasy. It's very colorful, often funny and radiant on your imagination. Children are main protagonists but unlike in It Follows they appear much more playful and childish.If you're already familiar with S. Kings' work, settings and location will ring a bell. Everything looks as I have imagined it to be while reading his books. Small town with shady past is as authentically portrayed as it can be. When it comes to fantasy and horror, 'It' completely goes in S. Kings' fashion. He almost never gives an explanation for weird and supernatural occurrences. Things just start to happen. Exactly the same route has been taken in The Mist (2007) were monsters start to appear and a reason why is never given. Some may find this approach too simplistic but that is the main reason why his books and movies are so good. The entire focus is placed on imagination and the main goal is to make you a part of a nightmare; and you don't get an explanation for them, do ya?Everybody who found Kings' movies and books fun is surely going to enjoy this movie. I'd also recommend 'It' to those who like horror genre, especially if you're tired of heavy topics and over the top violence.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"There's a lot more going on in this movie that you'll end up realizing by the end of it, I'll tell you a story too here (my thoughts after watching the movie)","First of all, besides great acting, great slow progressing and compelling story , good special effects , besides all of this great stuff there's a deeper, more meaningful message to take from this movie. So hear me out and follow me because I will tell you a story of my own. (no spoilers included). Concealed beneath all of this I've just previously stated there's more than reaches the eye, It tells us about how society is blind to its own fear and hatred, things we sometimes ignore, shows us we should be more aware of these things going on around us, in this movie this fear and hatred takes the form of an evil clown, but these are very real things and I believe this is what inspired Stephen King (if this remake was indeed written by him, that I do not know), but what I do know is the message it brings out, it teaches us to take up arms and face our fears and challenges, together, and face all evil that oppose us, because the worst of all modern evil comes from our own minds, nothing to fear but fear itself. The ""you'll float too"" thing kinda passed me by as I did not quite understand the meaning behind that, maybe more about it in a sequel (?). Great movie, even better message I took from it, hope you can all relate and felt inspired by this great work of art.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Worth waiting for.,"I made the decision to wait for the second part's release to watch it, and I watched the first one, and went straight to the cinema for this, for me it's one long film.Where do you start? It's a messed up book, with some real dark, crazy horror. Some of it translated here, some of it didn't. The famous scene where Pennywise is first seen I loved, it was terrifying, and from that first moment, I loved Bill Skarsgård, and have nothing but praise for him.People criticising the run time, clearly haven't read the book, it's a long, but rewarding book. As I now can compare the two films, I preferred this first installment. It's very well made, well acted, definitely enjoyable.Sometimes it felt more adventure then horror, it never really felt full on horror, there were some very good scenes, but they could have ramped it up a bit. Many people are terrified of clowns, they could have pushed that vibe a bit more. Lots of humour, too much though? Not sure, I didn't detect much humour in the book.I'm so glad Stephen King is on the big screen still, how about a reworking of The Tommyknockers?7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

You'll float too...,"This film had very high expectations from most people going in given it's excellent marketing campaign. It's crazy to think that it's first trailer is the most viewed trailer of all time within twenty- four hours beating the likes of huge franchise movies like ""Star Wars"" and ""Transformers"". However, it just goes to show how popular Stephen King's novel ""It"" and the property as a whole really is. People really like being scared by clowns for some reason. Anyway, I'm glad to say that this film not only met my expectations but wildly exceeded them.The movie just like the novel follows the seven teenagers of the self-proclaimed ""Loser's club"" in the seemingly timid town of Derry, Maine as they are terrorized by an entity simply called ""It"". This entity takes the form of your worst fears but usually appears as a 'Pennywise the dancing clown' to lure children in before essentially brutally devouring them. Each of the kids at some point are confronted by ""It"" as he torments them with his shape-shifting abilities. But with all their courage and teamwork they must overcome their fears in order to rid the town of ""It"".A really interesting thing about the story and each of the character's respective arcs is that it's not just the entity that causes them problems that they must learn to deal with. Instead most of the characters have very tangible conflicts. For example, Bill must deal with the loss of his younger brother, Eddie has an overbearing Mother which makes him a hypochondriac, Beverly has an abusive Father and they all deal with viscous bullying at the hands of the ""Bowers gang"". All of this realism gives the film a cerebral feel which is then complimented by the supernatural terror provided by ""It"".The reason this film works so well is because it nails down three- dimensional characters in a human story about childhood, fear, courage and friendship. The writing, directing and acting are all to thank for that. The director Andy Muschietti and the writers including Cary Fukunaga clearly understood the essence of the novel and what they needed to keep and remove to keep the film's pace steady.The cast of mostly unknowns is superb with the standouts for me being Finn Wolfhard as Ritchie who was hilarious, Jack Dylan Grazer as Eddie who was also funny but really gave his character innocence and vulnerability too and Jaeden Lieberher who gave a nuanced performance as the leader of the ""Loser's club"", Bill.Bill Skarsgards gives a delightfully creepy turn as Pennywise which heightens the tension of any scenes he appears in. If I had to pick one gripe with this film it's that some of the main characters such as Stanley and Mike are not really developed as well as the others but hopefully this will be rectified in part two when they are adults.But other than, all in all, this is a great adaptation of one of Stephen King's greatest and most popular novels and I can't wait for part two.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Great film but liked the first cast better,"I really enjoyed this incarnation of IT but I can't help but be biased simply because I am such a fan of the original. There were some things better about this film and some things better about the original, but what stood out most was the cast of kids in the original were vastly superior. Each character in the original had an unusual quality that made them stand out in some way while the kids in this film just kind of blended in with the crowd. The Ritchie Tozier character in the original played by Seth Green was far better and I was a bit let down they took away most of what made him so funny and unique with the gags and jokes and stuff. They also left out Ben's backstory about his father who died in the war and the fact he and his mother were forced to live with relatives. That was an important part of the storyline I don't think they should have omitted. The story telling overall was better in the original with the way the group came together.

You cannot feel yourself in awe how they nailed every joke, every speech (Bill's are the best, given he has this stuttering). Looking forward to seeing each one's next project. Bill Skarsgård's Pennywise is scary but not over-the-top scary. P.S.: I've been to movie theaters countless times, but IT is by far my best experience of all. The jokes and scare jump all landed collectively and it was just insane!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Entertaining but wish more was left to your imagination,This was an entertaining film but didn't do it for me as a horror film. The cast of young actors were brilliant and there were some cool set pieces but I definitely feel much of the horror of IT comes from your own imagination. The film makers tried to show too much too soon and by about half way through I felt they had run out of new material to really scare the audience.,6.0,Anonymous,Horror
January Embers,"Stephen King adaptations can be a mixed bag. For every masterpiece, A Shawshank Redemption and The Shining there are other productions that sit opposite, CELL, Bag of Bones and the deplorable Mist TV series to name a few. King has a huge body of work and some times it takes a film director to make or break his writing for a cinematic audience.Andy Muschietti and screenwriter Cary Fukunaga announced a cinema version of IT in 2014. Muschietti had directed MAMA and Fukunaga had gone into bat for Woody Harrelson and Matt Mcconaughey for the first season of True Detective. It was an interesting peering and then the production went quiet. until the first trailer.Based on the the Novel by King and the television version which featured Tim Curry as the clown antagonist obsessed with killing children the question was; would the trailer that broke the internet match up to everything read and seen before? and if so would it be better?After two full versions Andy Muschietti had a lot of work to do.Bill, Ben , Beverley, Richie, Mike, Eddie and Stanley live in the fictional town Derry Maine. They are all very early teenagers and find comfort among each other and are very close. Early on Bill loses his brother and it soon becomes obvious that Derry houses a demon so evil that adults cannot see it leaving it to the teens to do something about it. This is a very Stephen King story.After a relentless death that will go down in the halls of Horror as a great film murder. This becomes a very adult version of the story compared to the mini series but not so the novel which is even more adult. Stephen King WTF !!. The Clown PENNYWISE is pivotal early and Bill Skisgard is owning it in the first few seconds which is important not just for the story but also the cinematography sound and general tension.Muschietti has done an amazing job. Stephen King has mentioned he did not expect this to be as good as it is and he is right. This is a fantastic horror film but in saying it pays homage to the classic 80's and also addresses the issues of teens growing up ( Well almost ) and creates an on screen entity that future films other that the sequel will struggle to compete with.PENNYWISE is not nice, Hannibal Lecter not nice.A film that has had the highest opening of any horror film ever and it deserves this, We deserve it , This is the mini series on steroids and fills the gap between the three. Smart acting directing and writing for a simple horror film which has fallen into very caring hands.Bring on Chapter 2...It's going to get very nasty.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

"It's Horror Season, there's no time to be playing about...","A Fantastic time to watch Horror Movies, and a perfect time to review them.I love the concept of Pennywise, I thought the idea that he was an entity was really well played out in the movie, with lots of backstory about Pennywise himself. Who is a very interesting Villain. George's death scene, well the cinematography for that is on point. It's superb. And it's well shot too. The death scene is also spine-chilling. With Pennywise giving us this large grin. And I liked the fact that this scene was long, as it builds the tension up.The Characters,Are for the most part well developed. It feels like an 80's type movie, and that's what I like about this movie. The Character development is well handled inside the movie as well. There in a group (Stand by me) vibes. There all nerdy, and in away there all misfits in this case. And there all searching for clues, on how to try and defeat Pennywise.The movie is fairly basic, and is easy to follow. There's not much of anything else, apart from some eerie scenes. And I feel Pennywise should of been the focal point of the story, as I feel like he should of been in it more. I like the backstory of him being this identity that can shape-shift whenever he wants. I do question why he turned himself into a spider. And I do also like the fact he's been around since Earth. That was cool. What wasn't though however is the fact he turned himself into a spider. Making him less scary, and could be defeated more easily. So that didn't make sense.Overall a good movie though, 6.5/10Verdict,6/10 Easy to Follow and Understand, with great cinematography.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Largely a high quality horror experience.,"Rather 7.5 out of 10, for clarification.As stated in my summary: IT (2017) is largely a high quality horror experience.IT hosts an entourage of young actors who are members of the ""Loser's Club"" and deliver widely impressive performances. The members of the club are, as individuals, unique and quirky and the exploits of their private lives compose some of the most entertaining on screen material. Despite this, I firmly believe Wyatt Ollef's character of Stanley Uris would have most certainly benefited from some additional lines of dialogue. The aforementioned lack of dialogue leaves his character feeling (not wholly) but noticeably underdeveloped. Alternatively, Skarsgard undeniably excels as sadistic, demonic being Pennywise. The film exhibits a praiseworthy contrast of terrifying moments and humour. It is also worth noting that the film's initial scene serves as a highlight unparalleled by the remainder of the picture, in it's scares, performances, tone and cinematography. That's not to suggest, however, that the film doesn't consistently provide exceedingly good cinematography. With this considered, it is a major disappointment that a dramatically overt cliché crops up in the movie's final act; which is then superseded by a lesser (but still present) one. The film is a mass of tension, which is evident from the offset. It's also succeeds in delivering an abundance of creatively engrossing frights; the majority of which are executed by the exemplary Skarsgard. Overall, IT is a composite of quirky characters, a terrifyingly impressive demon and a contrast of terrifying moments and humour, unfortunately diminished by cliché's in the final act. I highly recommend IT for cinematic viewing, and eventually home viewing following it's release.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best horror movie in a while,"This has to the best horror movie I've seen in a very long time. Being completely honest, it wasn't as scary as I expected but it was WAY better than I expected.

Awful,"This movie ruined the soul of the book for me. I didn't understand if this was a comedy or a horror. Stephen King does not write comedy's like that. The kids are so annoying in this movie, their acting is so wrong for IT. They are against a creature like IT and they are so childish. They look so ""heroic"". The kids are the stars, Pennywise is just something to beat. That looks really lame to me. It is also giving more attention to the relationship between Bev and Bill then the character of Pennywise or anything else. ﻿",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

The original managed to bring me in that way.It was good of course. The actors did well, nice cinematography, Bill did well (and the ending is better than the original), but it just didn't haunt me as the original did. He didn't look and perform as creepy, even though he was creepy. I just got the feeling of a typical modern horror movie, which has its flaws.Definitely worth a cinematic watch. Do not let this horror movie slip through and end up on a small computer screen. One of the better horror movies of the decade.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best adaptations of Stephen King's work to date,"IT is a horror drama film based on the Stephen King novel of the same name. Starring Bill Skarsgård in the title role, the film not only succeeds as a terrifying horror film but also as one of the best adaptations of Stephen King's work to date.In 1989 in the town of Derry, Maine, a group of outcast kids known as the ""Losers Club"", are each terrorised by a frightening, shape-shifting entity they collectively refer to as ""IT"". When no one else in town will come to their aide, the kids decide to band together and fight against ""IT"" themselves while also overcoming their own personal demons.Like with comedy, horror is a highly subjective genre. What one may find scary may cause others to roll their eyes in annoyance. Thankfully, IT provides enough scares that seem as realistic as possible and prevent the film from being silly. This retelling takes itself very seriously and doesn't constantly rely on jump scares for legitimate horror, instead by building a creepy atmosphere of uncertainty and individual torment in each of the kids. The cast is fantastic, Bill Skarsgard's performance as IT, in particular that of his clown form Pennywise, is terrifying, almost on par with Heath Ledger's Joker in The Dark Knight. He definitely feels like more of a threat than Tim Curry's version, whom by today's standards seems a little too goofy and wacky to be scary. In addition to Pennywise, all of the child actors are brilliant. Not once did I ever feel unconvinced of the fear that they were feeling. Even the usual Stephen King tropes seemed more subdued in this film, aside from the usual setting in Maine, of course. If this is the future for adaptations of Stephen King's work, then I am most certainly on board.I rate it 8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Its not a horror film.,"OK just lets get one thing out of the way. I have not seen the original TV series or any other production of this story. I also have not read the book so this is not one of those ""its not as good as the book or original moans"". Having just watched the movie I can say its definitely worth watching. Its a well enough made film with some great effects and acting. However I did find some of the kids dialogue inaudible and it seemed to be difficult to pick out what they were saying sometimes with too many voices at once. Another issue with the sound was the odd choice of music which did not seem to sit right with the actual scenes. There were a few comedic parts which did not really seem to hit the mark either. However what I will say is that the film just is not scary. There's no tension before any of the supposed frights, they are set up in a way that you see them coming a mile off and when they do you basically find yourself thinking, OK so the clowns here and its doing its cgi thing but no that was not a surprise and I did not get a fright. In the screening I was I did not see a single person react to any of the scares. That is the main problem with this movie. The posters and trailers sell the film as a scary horror, which it is not. Its like a mix of The Lost Boys and Stand By Me. I could see this movie having a PG rating if one or two scenes were removed, but these scenes do not involve the clown. If you are expecting a real horror film or something closer to the book you may be disappointed. But go in with an open mind and you will probably enjoy it. Its an adventure movie not a horror.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Terrifying,"I have an irrational fear of clowns and it was nothing short of an act of congress to get me to see this film. I had a hard enough time with the TV series back in the day with the amazing Tim Curry but I have to say Bill Skarsgård will haunt my nightmares from here on out. The acting int the film is exceptional as is every other element of the movie. They truly went out of their way to place you back in the 80's midsummer. I felt as if I was a child watching a scary movie for the first time as I sat there in the theater trembling... I have mixed opinions on how to answer the question of if I like this movie, a large part of me screams NO but solely the fear of clowns, while the rest of my bellows YES from the tops of my lungs. I would recommend the film to anyone who might be looking for a masterfully made scary movie or anyone in love with Stephen Kings works... because this won't let you down, even if they all float.

It scared me so much that I lost all my milk!,"'It', based on one of Stephen King's bestselling novels, is sometimes touching, often funny and always scary.In the town of Derry, Maine several children have gone missing. A group of seven young friends (the Losers Club) are being tormented by Pennywise the clown, an evil shape shifting entity that feeds on children's fears. As the threat becomes larger the kids decide to fight and kill It.Since the novel is so long 'It' is difficult to translate to the big screen but the writers did a pretty good job. First off it's impossible to cram the whole book into one movie so they opted to only cover the childhood of the seven friends and not the adulthood. Another change from the novel is that the timeline shifts from the 50's to the 80's. Apart from some pop-culture references it serves no real purpose so it wasn't necessary.Director Andy Muschietti knows this kind of movie only works if you care about the characters. He takes his time to introduce them to us and to flesh them out. Then again he wastes no time and sets the tone from the start. The opening scene is brutal and serves as a warning for things to come. The scares follow each other up pretty fast.Pennywise played brilliantly by Bill Skarsgård has a lot to do with that. He's the main attraction of the movie. Although perhaps too much driven by CGI, Skarsgård is terrifying. But there's also another kind of horror. The children all have to deal with their own personal demons (loss of a brother & an abusive father among them). This makes 'It' a coming-of-age story about a bunch of friends facing their fears together and that is the heart of the movie.A lot rides on the child actors. They are mostly solid with Jaeden Lieberer as Bill and especially Sophia Lillis as Beverly standing out. She's a star in the making. Finn Wolfhard (from Stranger Things) plays Richie, the loudmouth who brings the much needed comic relief. Wyatt Oleff as Stan wasn't great but that might have to do with the fact that his character was perhaps a little flat.If you don't know what to expect, mix 'Stand By Me' with 'Super 8', add a splash of 'The Goonies' and top it off with a scary-ass clown.While 'It' is perhaps too long at the end (runtime is 135 min.) it's far better than the 1990 TV movie. If the movie is a success a sequel is inevitable but that's something to look forward to.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Really good horror film and adaptation although not great.,"IT could've have been great if it had had a darker tone.Using the character's psychological aspect and making the antagonist use those vulnerabilities against them while putting a touch of horror with a dark sadistic humor for him to work with kind of reminds you of child's play, nightmare on elm street (original) or the new series from Netflix's stranger things which is great. It has creepy scenes nevertheless but it's not going to scare you to death.The movie makes you care about the characters whether it is in the horror dark humor kind like IT was or the awesome friendship between the losers club where each had their own time to show bravery in addition to their great acting.Some use of jumpscares were bothersome and unnecessary because there were scenes that didn't need it since they already had horror shots there with an eerie atmosphere without the use of those types of sounds. Some creature designs (two at the most if memory doesn't fail me) were not scary and although the ending was really good, there might've been a way for them to have made it more creepy and horrific given the place they had at their disposal.This movie is really a 7.5 but here you can leave only closed ratings which is why I'm giving it a 7. It's a really competent horror film overall and a must have in blu Ray collection.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Floating with brilliance,"Just got back from seeing 'IT'. Expectations were that of great interest but also apprehension. Eight years ago, back when there was a personal unfamiliarity and ignorance of Stephen King's style and less appreciation for the book, there is the admission of saying don't bother with a re-make.Couldn't be more wrong. This was a case where another adaptation was not only warranted but necessary. 'IT' is such a great story that deserves to be done justice and with one of the best trailers of the year this actually looked good. However, with the other King film released this year 'The Dark Tower' being such a disappointment, there was apprehension as to whether a film based on such a huge book would work.'IT' as a book is one of King's best and one of the best of the horror genre. King's attention to detail, how he writes scenes with children and depiction of fear are unparalleled, with wonderfully drawn characters, one of the terrifying antagonists in literature and many unforgettable scenes, ones that burn long in the memory in how scary they are. The book is much more than just a horror story though, also with nostalgia, comedy, pathos and deep characterisation.'IT' was previously adapted as a mini-series in 1990, which is remembered fondly by those who saw it as children and left them terrified but often derided by fans of the book. To me, it has a lot wrong with it with a vastly inferior second half and an anti-climactic let down of an ending with the infamously terrible effects of IT's true form. But it is nowhere near one of the worst King adaptations, it's not even the worst of the mini-series. Compared to the book it's very poor, as a standalone it's wildly uneven but has more to it than Tim Curry's unforgettably magnificent Pennywise. It has a great first half with strong performances from the child actors, some unsettling moments, a 'Stand By Me'-like nostalgia and a great music score.This 2017 film adaptation is a big improvement and one of the best King adaptations in years. It does have changes, including the change in decade, not following the same structure, different IT encounters for some characters and another motivation for wanting to defeat IT. However, it is very loyal in spirit to the book that is apparent throughout. What makes it better are better production values, explanations and character motivations being more logical, Henry Bowers being more of a psychopath (and he is given a reason for why he came to be the way he is, when it was only implied once in passing previously), Beverly's father and the relationship between the two having more of a creep factor and even better child performances.Not without its faults. Not all the special effects work, the fangs and the overdone Pennywise shaking look cheap. Mike is underused and underdeveloped compared to the others and the other bullies are pretty much given short shrift (Victor Criss practically anonymous).Some people have said that 'IT' is not scary. Personally disagree, finding it one of the scariest films seen in a long time. Not many films recently made my heart jump, covering my eyes, biting nails or stifling a scream. The Niebolt Street, bathroom, George and Pennywise and photograph/slideshow scenes especially are absolutely terrifying, and there are beautifully timed jolts, real tension and eeriness and suspenseful lead-ups, aided by atmospheric intricate lighting and clever effects for IT's forms (that leper!).With that being said, 'IT' is much more than a horror film, and is more successful in its other elements. It has comedy, and it's hilarious especially with Richie and Eddie. There is an affectionate nostalgia, reminiscent of 'Stand By Me' and 'The Goonies' and reminding one of how good King was at writing scenes with children and childhood adolescence, which the writers understood and it translates brilliantly on screen. There is pathos, like with Ben's poem and the two most heart-wrenching moments are in the frightening, heart-tugging and triumphant climax. The characters are written very well on the most part, particularly Bill, Beverly and Ben, while Pennywise is evil-incarnate.Production values mostly are terrific, not just the lighting but also the beautifully realised Derry setting (Niebolt Street is a standout), taut editing and cinematography that's both stunning and unnerving. The effects mostly are not bad, the make-up is superb and how Pennywise is made up has a creepier effect. The music score is truly haunting, ""Oranges and Lemons"" has never freaked me out this much.Andy Muschietti directs with suspense, potent realism, confidence and affection, while the writing has a great balance of hilarious comedy, touching drama and pathos, references to the time period, King and history of Derry and nostalgia. The story, even with the change of time-line and structure, is cohesive and logical, rich in suspense and emotion but it's the chemistry between the children and the sweet and surprisingly real relationship between Beverly and Ben that resonate most.One couldn't ask for better performances. The children are uniformly wonderful, especially a vulnerable Sophia Lillis, a hilarious Finn Wolfhard and a relatable Jeremy Ray Taylor. Jaeden Lieberher handles Bill's dramatic arc very touchingly while Jack Dylan Grazer is very funny. Mike and Stan are well cast. As for Pennywise, it is a very difficult feat filling the iconic Tim Curry's giant clown shoes, but Bill Skarsgard does so superbly, providing a different interpretation that never feels like a copy and has just as much chilling menace, nightmarish air and dark twisted amusement. Curry's laugh is creepier, but Skarsgard's is closer to that described in the book.All in all, brilliant and if the second film with the adults happens please have the same writer, director and Skarsgard on board, and use this as a model rather than the mini-series' second half with better cast adults and a far better ending. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"when dealing with an evil entity, sometimes you gotta be creepy","I've never read Stephen King's novel about a supremely evil force that terrorizes a Maine town, but this adaptation is worth seeing. Bill Skarsgård plays Pennywise as a truly malevolent being who knows just how to get into people's confidence. Basically, 2017's ""It"" is a creepy movie that hits the right notes. The children do a fine job with their roles. Like some of Stephen King's other works - ""The Body"" (adapted as ""Stand by Me"") and ""Hearts in Atlantis"" - it does a good job showing how the adults are lousy role models, so the children join up to achieve something. But make no mistake, Skarsgård is the real star. Don't be surprised if you want to sleep with the light on after seeing his performance.I also recommend the 1990 miniseries, and I hope to read the novel. Good one.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
When Pennywise Disappointed,"I have to say, I was really disappointed with the movie ""IT Chapter One."" I had just finished reading the book in 2.5 weeks, and I was excited to see how it would translate onto the big screen. However, my excitement quickly turned into frustration and disbelief just 30 minutes into the film. It was absolutely awful!One of the biggest issues I had with the movie was the decision to change the time period. In the book, the story takes place in the 1950s, which adds a certain charm and atmosphere to the narrative. But in the movie, they decided to modernize it, and it just didn't work for me. It felt like the director and producer were trying to compensate for their poor interpretation by adding a few parts from the book to make it seem like they actually read it.Another major letdown was the lack of scares. I mean, come on, it's a horror movie! But instead of genuine scares, all we got were loud screams and cheap jump scares. It felt like they were relying on these cheap tactics to try and create a sense of horror, but it just fell flat.The movie started off promisingly with a nice opening scene that stayed faithful to the book. However, after that, it became episodic, offering up truncated and modified scenes one after another. It felt like the movie was just sniffing at the epic source material, never fully embracing its potential. There was no tension, and it certainly never achieved the level of scariness that the book had. The kid acting was okay, but nothing exceptional.Overall, ""IT Chapter One"" was a disappointing movie. It had its moments, but they were overshadowed by the film's shortcomings. Given the epic scale of the source material, it's possible that it was just too ambitious to be properly adapted into a film, even as Part I. I have to give credit to the cinematographer, though, as the visuals were well done. But if you're looking for a truly scary movie, I would recommend watching ""Carrie"" instead.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Waste of oxygen,"This movie was just awful. It was not scary, the characters were dull and did what the plot told them to. The acting was awful, but that's expected of kids.

You're better of watching some Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles than watching this bad screenplay and writing.",,Anonymous,Horror
A brilliant new direction for the horror genre,"As someone who is not a massive horror fan this is the type of horror film that I would enjoy and that I wish studios would do more often. It elevates the horror game completely, it shows us that a horror film can be done well and done right and still have a central storyline that is engaging and full of interesting/relatable characters. It really tries to separate itself from the crowd, avoiding common horror tropes like jump scares. This is something that I really liked, it is a very inventive film that does just replace the central 'monster'/threat with a new one making no attempts at character building and actually telling a coherent story. The balance of horror and story telling was grasped very well as we don't feel too expositional or a sense of pointlessness.It has a wonderful cast of characters, all the child actors did great at portraying children in such a situation. They had great chemistry with each other and gave performances that showed such courage and love that is truly beyond their age. Alexander Skarsgard who played Pennywise also captured this character very well, from the way that his eyes pointed at different directions(one directly at the audience), his speech pattern and movement were all done impeccably.It also tackles a few central themes very well, the themes of fear, bullying, small town ugliness and a coming of age story. The fear element was done very well, the way that It can morph into the physical appearance of one's fear gave lots of space to explore fear and specifically what children fear. For example whenever Bill felt afraid we see rain or water, relating to his greatest fear of losing his brother. Or in Beverly, where the theme of blood can be seen, relating to her fear of maturity and sexual impulses. These subtle details were dropped in very well and ties in perfectly with the sense of fear that the story tries to explore.Also, there is a very interesting way in which It depicts the adults in this small town, the movie shows us the most grotesque angles of humanity. This may be another way of depicting how children view adults as monsters and fear adults, but it may also be tieing in with the idea that the small town feel is just a mask for grotesque humanity. The way that the adults carry out disgustingly immoral acts and simply turn a blind eye to all that is happening in the town are just a few examples of this.Overall, It was a great film that reminded me a lot of several mature movies/TV shows about children. Stuff like Goonies and Stranger Things just to name a couple. If this film must be criticised I think it is with the lack of development in Pennywise's character, even though this could be to preserve a sense of mystery and may be resolved in the second film. Also the middle area of the film verges on being slightly repetitive with the scenes of each child being attacked by Pennywise, but these really are just minor, personal complaints",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Even better than the original,"Creepy as hell, it managed to even outdo the original, as it focused the entirety of its run time on "" It "" stalking and terrorising the group of kids in 1989. The cast of unknown child actors handled the fear, and humour in perfect balance, while Pennywise was even creepier than in the original. There were also a few brilliantly subtle music cues, amongst a lot of crescendosI want to see horror films return to having a physical villain ( as last year's Green Room, and Don't Breathe, as well as this film has ) rather than yet another ghost story/ supernatural/ haunting flick, like we've had seemingly never ending examples of in the past several years. Granted, this film has supernatural elements in it, but it simultaneously has an actual villain, a physical entity threatening the protagonists, which is where I hope horror films return to.Its 135-minutes long run time basically flew by quickly.The opening credits call the film, It, while the closing credits call the film, It Chapter One.The Cult, my all time favourite band, are on the soundtrack, also.

Victim Of Overkill,"As a huge fan of ""Stand By Me"", I joined the crowd of first weekend viewers of this Stephen King story, at least the first half. I was somewhat disappointed, for a number of reasons. First, like too many movies today, there is too much noise and CGI. The fact that the technology has become so advanced, should not mean that it is used more than needed. There are so many jolts and excessive morphing scenes that would be totally impossible of any creature, that it becomes more like a ride in an amusement park dark house, with ugly images and creatures trying to grab you, along with loud noises. It's not scary, really. There is nothing psychologically disturbing. Second, while it may follow the book, having about a dozen kids make it hard to clearly differentiate their identities and characteristics. There was, admittedly, some humorous moments, and many were likable, but unlike ""Stand By Me"", you don't get to care much for more than one or two of them. Third, too many scenes were very dark, which may make scares easier, but hard for the viewer to see. And personally, Pennywise was too advanced mechanically to be believable, and hence really scary, at least for me. I really wanted to like this film, and I didn't hate it. It just suffers from what so many genre films suffer from today: Overdoing the effects at the cost of the story and depth of the characters.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Floats Above the Original,"In the first 10 minutes of the remake of Stephen King's ""It"", I was taken aback by how much more violent and graphic it was than its 1990 predecessor. I recalled a creepy yet campy made-for-TV movie that was ultimately forgettable were it not for the spectacularly unsettling performance by Tim Curry in the title role. I initially attributed this upswing in gore to the Hollywood trend of remakes, dial it up to 11 and hope for the best. It didn't take long for me to see that there was something more at work here. As the familiar story ticked on I realized that this movie isn't for those who are being introduced to the story for the first time. It's for those, of my generation, who knew that the evil of ""IT"" was waiting its obligatory 27 years to reemerge and scare the hell out of us again as adults.In the small town of Derry Maine, big brother Bill is paper folding the ill-fated SS. Georgie on his bed. Little brother Georgie scampers in to take his toy boat out to the rainy gutters of the neighborhood. Bill and Georgie have an unrealistically precious relationship. Georgie is literally too cute to live. As the little tike chases the makeshift sail-boat down the street, it becomes clear that the swollen $35 million budget was put to good use. From the original, we know Georgie's floating destiny, but how he arrives there is a red flag for the extremes we can expect for the 135 run-time. Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard) looks nothing like the Bozo interpretation by Curry. More like a mix between John Wayne Gacy and John Leguizamo from Spawn. The only real acting Skarsgard gets to do is in those creepy few minutes, menacingly gawking out of that gutter. The rest of Pennywise's appearances are too heavily CGI'd to require an actor. Most of the character's appearances are relegated to creepy waving and jump- scares. This might sound disappointing if Pennywise's only manifestation was as a clown.More than the terror of this ever-morphing entity, the town of Derry itself is a certain type of hell for children. There are sadistic bullies that would be showing mercy by simply punching you in the face. There are no adults in the traditional sense as they are all guilty of apathy, predatory hungers, or just being former bullies who now own small businesses. The 7 protagonist children have nowhere to turn when their personal nightmares starting coming to life. Bill has lost his brother the year before with parents who have all but moved on. Beverly is becoming a woman in a home where her single father's loving touch is completely unwelcome. Mike, the home-schooled slaughterhouse worker, may have the most traumatizing past which is only briefly capitalized on. That brevity might have been a good idea considering how it would clash hard with the tongue-in-cheek humor that makes most of the horror palatable. The other members of the group, Richie, Ben, Eddie, and Stanley have their own triggers but they don't stem from trauma At least not yet.Pennywise gets a disappointing amount of dialogue, but it is made up for by our 7 heroes, self-dubbed The Losers. Richie (Finn Wolfhard of ""Stranger Things"" notoriety) is particularly hilarious with one- liners that would kill in any Apatow flick. The others are given depth of character through realistic interpersonal relationships and convincingly fitting into the late 80's aesthetic. Their world is a terrifying fantasy, but the nostalgia is refreshingly real.With the reverence that the creators of IT have shown the material, I was surprised to find the small catalogue they have contributed to in the past. Director Andy Muschietti created the stylish, but ultimately forgettable ""Mama."" Only Gary Dauberman of the three screenwriters has had notable contributions to the genre, writing the disappointing ""Annabelle"" and much better ""Annabelle: Creation."" So it is quite satisfying to see that this was likely a passion project for these artists. The result being a dutiful and exhilarating remake that has every right to stand up to, and even float above the original.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Really well made !,"The current trend of horror movies usually involve sudden 'in-your-face' movements which are pretty scary. Having seen many such movies, it is hard to shock the audience.This movie is based on Stephen King's book which was written back in 1986. As such, it follows the trend of those times - good storyline, interesting characters, good chemistry between them, good acting & slow psychological buildup of scary scenes rather than sudden movements. Its a refreshing change to see such a movie. Bill Skarsgård has done a splendid job as Pennywise the shapeshifting demon. His wicked smile remains with you even after the movie. There are plenty of hidden scary parts in the scenes which remain in the background (eg : the library scene). Highly recommend watching it on the big screen.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
it could be...,"it could be a good adaptation. or a decent horror. or one of films who remains, for a long time, seductive collection of scenes. but it is a splendid eulogy of friendship. remembering ""The Lord of Rings"". but giving the essence of childhood as the best field for strong relations. this does it special. and, off course, the performance of Bill Skarsgard, not surprising but good prize for expectations of the viewer who knows his roles and the art to build the characters.I admit - after the adaptation from 1990, the expectations about a new version on screen of ""It"" makes me skeptical. and Tim Curry was the perfect Pennywise. but Andy Muschietti has the courage and the science to give more than a modest remake. and this is the axis of this real beautiful film.",,Anonymous,Horror
Not by the words of the book but has the same feel,"You may be hearing negative reviews about the CGI or the minor inaccuracies to the book, and i will not spoil these but i think that this does not make a difference if you are going to see a Stephen King movie or are just going out to enjoy a horror film. This film is scary, but does not overload you with jump scare after jump scare. Instead the makers took the right path and built up tension throughout the first act with downright terrifying imagery like something Stephen King would have come up with even if not all of it was accurate to the book because in some cases, if it was, that would have disrupted the flow of the movie. And to balance this, they added the good-natured light child-hood summer atmosphere to ease the audience with a Stand By Me (or rather it!) feel to it. One complaint i have is that the movie should of either had more dialogue from Pennywise or less of him because i feel that some of the other monsters should have gotten more screen time to shine. To conclude, to a normal movie goer, you will enjoy this film for it's tense atmosphere, it's jokes, it's smooth story-telling and Richie! To a movie goer wanting a Stephen King movie, you will enjoy all that, the casting and the care gone into making it have the heart and soul of childhood memories that the book had. I recommend this film to all.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"IT- ""You'll Float, too...""","It's fair to say that recently, Hollywood has had an over reliance and abundance of horror remakes and ""re-imaginings"", from 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' to 'Halloween' to 'A Nightmare on Elm Street'- all with varying degrees of critical and financial success (although, they tend to make the BIG BUCKS. Most of the time, we don't need them, but every once in a while a remake comes along and knocks it out of the park and into the sewer drain!I'm talking, of course, of 'IT'. The success of this film has been extraordinary. After the announcement of another film version of Stephen King's most bizarre book, and its shaky production, it's safe to say that it has all paid off tremendously well! The film-makers have created a fun, creepy, funny and at times heart-warming coming of age tale that really takes you by surprise when the surprises are thrust upon you. A film about friendship, fear and love... and balloons.Let me start of by saying that this is not a perfect horror film. In fact it's in no way that terrifying (to me, anyway). The scares, at times come of as cheap and predictable, and that's something that Director Andy Muschietti should have tried to avoid with this particular film. It's something that modern horror has made a trend of... silence... silence... JUMP!The Losers Club are fantastic. These child actors have created such real and enduring characters and they're such a joy to watch. In particular, Jaeden Lieberher as Stuttering Bill, Jeremy Ray Taylor as Ben, the adorable Sophia Lillis as Beverly and Finn Wolfhard as Richie Tozier. The entire ensemble do incredibly well, but those four happen to be my personal stand-outs.However, the stand-out of all the stand-outs (and the centre of the marketing ploy that has got millions flocking to the cinemas) is Bill Skarsgård's Pennywise the Dancing Clown. Never before in the World of horror have we had such an ambitious and mesmerising performance. From the voice, the astonishing make-up and costume, the ticks and body language; Skarsgård has made a cinematic icon of Freddy Krueger proportions... especially when he is used very sparingly.My only gripe (apart from the cheap jump scares) is that the CGI ruins the novelty of the film a bit. In a horror film, the effects are best when they are practical.The film is a simple 'kids vs monster' film of the 80's, and I think that's what the film-makers had in mind; a good-old fashioned fun piece of film.I don't know what else to say, the movie is so much fun, with great atmosphere and great characters... go see it and float!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not Just Your Typical Horror Movie, It's Much Much More Than Just That","Yah I grew up with the 90's original TV mini-series, and yes I have read the extensive but unique Stephen King Novel, It. I've been waiting for this movie to be made for quite some time, cause all though I do find the original 1990 It to be a harmless, cheesy horror flick that you can have fun with, I felt as if it did not do too much justice to Stephen King's sufficient story. The 2017 It movie, I can gladly say was one of the biggest surprises of the year. This film not only was a horror film with some good scares, but a emotionally impacting coming of age film, about friendship and lost. No joke, I actually got very emotional towards the end and even throughout the entirety of the film, due to some of the very important themes this film portrays.     What I surprisingly actually liked the most in this film was the relationship between all the kids in this film. Every kid in this film acts so well, and they're all given very entertaining dialogue that was consistently intriguing throughout this entire movie. The film doesn't tone down on kids cursing or anything, these kids will make sex or immature jokes all the time and I enjoyed it so much, because it felt real. To my knowledge I definitely remember most kids at my middle or high school making inappropriate R-Rated jokes a lot so that was real treat. This film also, is actually quite funny. Particularly this kid in the film named Richie played by Finn Wolfhard from Stranger Things, was absolutely hilarious. All the kids stand out, they're all given really emotional backgrounds, that are sometimes really disturbing particularly with Sophia Lillis's character that really added to the films levity. I thought it was very unique for this horror movie to develop these characters for most of the run-time of this film, in having to sacrifice scares and what not. Most horror movies these days typically never develop the characters a lot, and rather throw a bunch of scares at random people instead of having the chance to allow the viewer to understand certain people's backgrounds. Thank you, to the screenwriters, noticing that a bundle of character development, would ultimately save this film from going under the radar as your everyday cliché horror flick.As for Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise, I thought he was incredible. Probably the most perfect adaption of Pennywise we will ever get. He really killed it. Nothing for me about him particularly scared me, maybe because I don't find clowns scary, but every scene he was in made me feel so unnerving. It was almost like I had such a level of intensity built up with me, cause every time I saw him on screen I was just waiting for him to do something terrible. Because generally, most of the time Pennywise is on screen, he does normal clown stuff like normal clowns do. He does his silly laugh, smiles a lot, talks about balloons and what not, it just really disturbed me. I can't exactly explain it, but the eeriness of Pennywise really just blew my mind in this film, No spoilers of course, but there is a particular scene at the very beginning of the film, that I will stand by as probably one of the all time best scenes I have ever seen in a horror movie. There was so much uncomfortable but satisfying vibes going throughout me when I saw the scene, and it just basically gave me the predicament that this film was going to be pretty exceptional.As for flaws I don't have many, but I do think they overuse CGI a bit too much sometimes. There's a particular form, that is shown in the film a couple of times that really didn't work for me. All though, sometimes they do use the CGI for good reason, involving Pennywise's scenes that didn't bother me whatsoever.So overall It is pretty much a near perfect adaptation of King's novel. It didn't really scare me, so that might come across to some as very disappointing, but the fact that this film allowed itself to be more of a coming of age, emotionally impactful, and exceptionally fun and thrill-riding, mystery, adventure throughout, I was satisfied to the highest level. I can actually say, that I can see It becoming a possible horror classic in the near future. I think It is one of the better, Stephen King adaptations I've ever seen, and if you're looking for something that is going to enthrall you, for 2 hours and 15 minutes, I definitely recommend checking out It. I'd give It a grading of a solid A, and a score of a 9.5/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Wait. This was good?? (L)IT!,"So, I went and seen IT with my girlfriend and was absolutely blown away. My girlfriend and I are big fans of the original IT 'Miniseries"" and it made us happy to see that they had done this new movie well.The gore was over the top for sure but it seemed to work and kept me tempted. Every time you thought, the jump scare was not going to happen, it did and I hate when a horror movie builds up a scare and then it never happens. All that for nothing.IT was genuinely scary and held true to the story for the most part, which was awesome. It had an absolutely amazing cast, which included an amazing casting choice for IT and the kid from ""Stranger Things"" was in it.The scares were great. The Comedy was great. The story was held to. Fun as all hell to watch.I recommend, Gavin Johns, Wanna-be-critic, sk8teboard11@gmail.com",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

1990 version was better,"The old TV movie from 1990 is better and portrays a bleaker derry that is truer to the book. It portrayed more mystery, suspense and in general was much more eerie.The new version isn't scary AT ALL and the costume design for IT himself reminds me more of Beetlejuice or someone out of Alice In Wonderland whilst the other mutations just make you laugh.The casting is excellent and the acting is pretty good, in parts, but most of the kids are really bad at acting genuinely scared which makes the 'supposed to be' scary moments essentially emotionless.The worst thing for me is the directors 'decision' to omit the adult portion of the story to make a... you guessed it... another separate movie. Quite ridiculous when one of the best bits about the book is how King interweaves the two timelines.Maybe worth a watch if you like Stranger Things (which imo is scarier), but if you like the book or want a truer portrayal of IT watch the 1990 version.",,Anonymous,Horror
Sucks the Scares Right Out of the Stephen King Novel,"Horror really is subjective, isn't it?""It"" as a novel was terrifying, and if its popularity is any indication, people thought ""It"" the movie was pretty scary too. But I found mighty little to even creep me out, let alone outright scare me in this film adaptation. I read the book long ago, so my memory might be a little hazy, but as I recall it, this film is only very liberally based on the novel, and only half of the novel at that (the end credits tell us that there is at least one sequel to come). The lack of fidelity, however, is not what I object to in the film. It's the inability of the screenwriters and director to capture on film anything that's remotely as scary as what King conjures in his book. His novel was one sustained note of creeping dread, while the film is hard sell, throwing jump scares and loud sound effects at us, and nothing in it looks like anything we haven't seen in every trailer for every horror movie made in the last 10 years. The cast of young actors is quite good, and indeed the thing I liked best about the movie was its ability to capture that painful and poignant feeling only adults are able to have about childhood because they're looking back on it as something lost. I think I might have been more interested in a movie about that with this cast and director than the one I got, not necessarily a ringing endorsement for a horror movie.The sequel clearly intends to cover the part of the book when all of the adults come back to Derry to once again confront their childhood ghoul, but I don't think I'll be in line to see it.Grade: C",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bill Skarsgard is brilliant as the evil clown Pennywise,"Novels by Stephen King are not seen as real literature, but adaptation of these novels can result in very good films. I am referring to films such as ""Carrie"" (1976, Brian de Palma), ""The shining"" (1980, Stanley Kubrick) and ""Misery"" (1990, Rob Reiner).The King adaptation most closely related to ""It"" is however ""Stand by me"" (1986, Rob Reiner). Both films combine the coming of age and horror genres. Both films are about kids of approximately 12 years old, bullied by teenagers of 18. Contrary to ""Stand by me"" in ""It"" the group of lead characters contains a female member, that evolves to the romantic interest of some of the other group menbers during the film. This female character (Beverly March played by Sophia Lillis) looks a lot like Molly Ringwald from ""The breakfast club"" (1985, John Hughes) as is also noticed in the film itself.When we compare ""Stand by me"" with ""It"", the coming of age element is more prominent in ""Stand by me"" and the horror element in ""It"". The dead body that represents the horror element in ""Stand by me"" is far less supernatural than the evil clown Pennywise (played by Bill Skarsgard) in ""It"". The evil clown in ""It"" knows the worst fear of every single member of the group of lead characters and tries to take advantage of it. We learn that these worst fears are in one way or another related to the situaton at home. In this respect there is some connection between the horror element and the coming of age element. Growing up also means facing and overcoming your fears.The evil clown Pennywise made me think of Mr Dark from ""Something evil this way comes"" (1983, Jack Clayton). Mr Dark also knew intimate things about his victims, only these intimate things were their greatest wishes and his victims were adults.Bill Skarsgard plays the evil clown Pennywise brilliantly. He is at his most brilliant right at the beginning of the movie when he is talking to Georgie with a dangerously seducing voice. This scene made me think of the fist conversation between Dr Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling in ""The silence of the lambs"" (1991, Jonathan Demme).Other associations of me were the bright yellow raincoat of Goergie (""Don't look now"", 1973, Nicolas Roeg) and the members of the group riding their bikes (""ET"", 1982, Steven Spielberg).At the end of the film the option of a sequel is left open very explicitly. After the success of the film this option of course materialized (2019), and as could be expected the sequel was weaker .",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Clowns and more clowns,"If you didn't like clowns before and if Tim Curry scared the beejesus out of you with his version of Pennywise, you are going to walk out of the cinema this time vowing never again to want to see any clown, including ones which seemed benign before.Where do I start with this movie. Obviously a lot of the book is not here (as what movie maker ever wants to see kids getting it on with each other) but this movie at least shows better than the mini series, how Bill and Beverly have a sexual tension between them and Ben looks on with heartbreak. It also shows the other boys gawping at Beverly as teens will do. Very well done at least for showing just some of the reasons why the 'Loser Club' bonded so well. The scene where Beverly's dad tried to rape her is very close to what happens in the book, showing how the evil permeates all the actions of adults around Derry. Henry and his teen bully gang are seriously nasty in this movie, again more like the ones in the book. There are extra things added in like Stanley being scared of a picture of a woman which looks like a Munch painting 'The Scream'. There's also changes in how each child repels attacks.Odd scenes have been added as well but I will leave it to you to see if you think they fit in with the flow of the movie.My teen son went with me to the movie and was checking his watch all the time as he didn't understand the slow build up of the story and was waiting for more 'boom-shock-horror' than the movie really has. His loss not mine as I was engrossed.Pennywise is more awful than the Tim Curry version as it is quite clear in this movie we are not dealing with a normal ghost/spectre/ghoul even at this stage of the first movie (of what will end up as 2 and obviously the second movie will show the kids as adults, just like part 2 of the mini-series did). Only thing I found false was that near the end, Pennywise halted for far too long to attack/eat some of the kids.Overall, a very worthwhile experience, albeit with changes from the book and mini-series.The child actors are very, very good and 'own' this movie. The landscapes are much better than in the Mini series and I thought I understood much better the layout of the Barrens. Bill Skasgard has a hard job of following Tim Curry but his version of the evil clown stands up with the old one. Very, very well made movie and I can't wait to see part 2!I will also dust off my old paperback version of the story and re-read now after 20 years.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good kids in a safe and a bit outdated adaptation,"The new adaptation of IT has a lavish Spielbergian approach to the proceedings which partly works and partly really doesn't. All child actors are well cast, with their strengths and weaknesses perfectly at display. Their interaction and friendship is handled with ease and good humour and is by far the most enjoyable part of the story.Less tasteful is how they interact with adults who are distant and authoritative or just as much monsters as the one that is after the kids. The recent Stranger Things, one cast member of which reappears, had this covered much better, with the obvious note that Stranger Things itself is an evolution of King's and Spielberg's earlier works. The school bullies are also ridiculously evil and inhuman which is seldom seen in today's media.As King's popular novel is much copied, the terrifying events, however carefully produced, come across somewhat outdated. The number of jump scares feels like yet another throwback to old-school horror. Music swells to underline everything that happens on the screen, with no emotion without a score to tell the audience exactly what they should be experiencing right now. That gets intrusive quickly.What the marketing entirely skips, this is actually the part 1. It covers the first half of the novel only, with the rest coming in the part 2.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

By far Bill Skarsgård should win an Oscar for Best actor and the movie itself should win for Best feature film.Parents IT is rated R and when you see Bill Skarsgård's Pennywise you will see why it is just plain out scary. It will definitely make everyone wet there pants that is how Scarry it is. I recommend to wear more the one pair of underwear to make sure you don't wet yourself.

Send in the Clowns,"The 1990 version of this, with Tim Curry as Pennywise the killer clown, was a 3-hour miniseries. This new edition calls itself IT Chapter One, so at least one sequel can be franchised (hopefully just the one). There are echoes of other Stephen King adaptations in this nerve-shredding visit to Derry, Maine (regular King territory), where there's a summer of child abductions and murders every 27 years.The whole movie is screened from the viewpoint of the kids, mostly the half-dozen plucky young teens who do battle with the monster in the late 1980s. They're a geeky bunch: one with glasses, one with a weight problem, one with a stammer, one with an over-protective mom. There's also a bunch of older bullies whom we remember from CARRIE (and GREASE and every other teen movie). And there is one girl, Beverley (Sophia Lillis, who has all the tomboy appeal that Jamie Lee Curtis brought to her early 'Scream Queen' roles); Beverley has a very creepy possessive single-parent dad. It seems weird that apart from glimpses of dysfunctional parents and teachers, there are no adults called in as the kids – on their own – tackle the new killer on the block.As horrors go, this one is pretty scary without too much resort to evisceration. The clown monster Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard, not as camp as Tim Curry but pretty evil) has bunny teeth which early on we see opening into a CGI shark array worse than Alien.This workmanlike version of IT (Chapter One) is faithful to the spirit of King's novel and is definitely up there with the better movies sourced from a book of his - with SHAWSHANK, MISERY, the original CARRIE and STAND BY ME still the front-runners (for me). Let's hope they make an outstanding job of Chapter Two.",,Anonymous,Horror
Decent Amount of Nightmare Fuel,"As a non-reader of the book and a non-viewer of the previous theatrical version of IT, I went into this movie not really knowing what to expect. And yet, it somehow was exactly what I expected.The positives of IT- For a child of the 80's, this film is filled to the brim with nostalgia. The settings were perfect for the time period. Movie signs, posters in kid's bedrooms, and clothing were all enjoyably accurate. The bright spot of the show are the childhood bonds developed smartly on screen between this rag tag group of ""losers"". The characters are real, have depth, and it was easy to feel an emotional connection. The file does a good job of flipping between sentimental coming-of-age flick to scare your pants off horror in the blink of an eye. The movie had plenty of laughs and fulfilled one of my major requirements for being able to enjoy a horror- I knew when it was time to be scared and knew when it was time to not. Nothing's more stressful to me than seeing a horror movie that is non-stop anxiety about a jump-out moment. IT is very easy to enjoy during the ""happy"" times, and almost always lets you know when it's time to hunker down in your seat for some nightmare fuel. Visually beautiful, well directed and shot, and of course plenty of white knuckle scary clown scenes. Sophia Lillis was an unknown to me and her performance stole the show.The negatives of IT- IT falls into the same trap as most horror movies of trying to resolve a scatterbrained plot line whilst scaring the crap out of its audience. I felt like if I had read the book I'd have been greatly disappointed in the effort to explain the history of why what was happening was happening. Sure the kids discover some things along the way, but at no point whatsoever was the subject of WHY this was happening ever breached. In typical horror fashion, main characters make decisions that no rational human being would ever make, and every adult or figure of authority is either oblivious or absent. The humor was good for a while, but Finn Wolfhard's character (Richie) was basically there only for comic relief and was a bit overdone.Overall I had a good time watching IT. The entire theater was engaged and made it a fun experience. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
IT - Not Your Average Horror Film,"There is certainly no scarcity of Stephen King adaptations in Hollywood, from the gems that were the Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, Misery and The Shining, to the wasteland of movies like Cell and Sleep Walkers. These adaptations occupy both extremes of the spectrum. IT is yet another adaptation of perhaps one of the author's more popular novels, the thousand page book was adapted into a mini series in the 90s with a great performance from Tim Curry as the iconic character Pennywise the clown, the series however received mixed reviews yet all the same is considered a beloved by many King fans. Needless to say this latest remake had some high expectations to live up too. After less than a month in cinemas it is safe to say IT has exceeded them.Andy Muschietti has helmed horror before, his 2013 flick Mama although trampled by critics was adored by audiences. Mama did well enough at the box office, earning $146 million, to pique the interests of studios for the IT adaptation which was at that time in a dormant period of production. Finally in the early months of 2016 Muschietti signed on and production hit the fast lane. Almost two years in the making, with little marketing Muschietti has managed to craft a film nothing short of profound.IT is not your average horror film, it's not the run of the mill, cliché overflowing jump scare fest that most modern horror films are, but instead a sophisticated and character driven thrill ride. The film doesn't deliver because of a single aspect , it's not just the scares or just the acting, or just the sets it's every cog turning to work the bigger machine.Perhaps the the most vital component of a horror film is, well the horror and IT doesn't disappoint. The two hour fifteen minute run time is a hundred and thirty five minutes of high quality horror. Are there jump scares? Yes, but not only are they justified but they work. So rest assured, there are no raccoons jumping out of trash cans to give the audience cardiac arrest. Bill Skarsgard's acting as Pennywise is really what fuels the horror in this film, the fact that he looks evil and hides in dark sewers is not what makes his character terrifying. It's the range he shows within this character, at times he really does seem like a great guy to hang out with, that is of course before he dismembers you. The opening scene of this movie really sums up Pennywise, the scene is one of the most powerful scenes in the movie and perhaps one of the greatest scenes of tension and terror in modern horror. Skarsgard effortlessly embodies his character perfectly creating the sadistic, diabolical and twisted Pennywise the clown.Now the scares aside, does IT work as a film? This is often the fear audiences have walking into a horror film, often directors get so caught up in making a genre film they forget to make a good movie. IT has a great antagonist but the audience needs to root for someone, they need the relatable but realistic protagonists that modern horror often overlooks. Our protagonists in IT are the losers club, a band of bullied kids in the town of Derry. They are quickly thrown into the whirlpool of evil and soon become the town's only hope. The cast includes Jaeden Lieberher, Finn Wolfhard, Sophia Lillis, Jack Grazer, Wyatt Oleff, Chosen Jacobs and Jeremy Taylor. They're all kids yet they play their characters like they've been acting for years. The chemistry between these teens is perfect, their characters well written and varying, however to the extent that you believe they are true friends not paper thin, expendable victims. In fact the acting all around is near perfect, the characters are not exposition machines, the kids act like real kids not mature adults in child bodies, the result is a film with characters you are invested in and characters you care about.Andy Muschietti said it himself in an IMDb review, ""this is not your average horror film"", it really isn't. Muschietti doesn't treat the movie as a pure genre film, he weaves in humour and light hearted moments which do not come off as abrupt or out of place but natural within the setting and among the characters. The film in addition, adds details and hints throughout that may not directly affect the plot but that certainly do contribute a layer of complexity and depth to the outcome. For example the film opens with the haunting and beautifully composed score. As the scene progresses we see the score is not in the background but is being played on a piano by a character. There's a scene in a library, keep your eye on the librarian. It's moments like these that set this film apart from conventional horror. From the horror to the acting the film grasps every opportunity to craft a meaningful horror film. IT will last, it is far from forgettable and deserves repeat viewings not so much to comprehend but to notice the artistry. King fans will be pleased, horror fans will be pleased and all of them will be up at night after this one.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

C: Yes, I saw IT.I wish I had been thinking more along the lines of ""What the hell was that!?"" or ""GD, I'm not seeing that again!"" or ""Man, that scene in the house, freaky!""But sadly, no. It just wasn't that scary, nor was it that creepy. Nor was it funny. It was a film with some good acting by kids, some decent make up, some okay effects and not much else. Years from now I won't be talking about this film like I have after seeing Psycho, The Exorcist, Split, Get Out, Alien or other classic horror films. For creeps, see the Japanese psychological thriller ""Creepy"" or the Dutch film ""Borgman.""The film has too many clichés. What's with the scary teeth? For me, scary teeth became a cliché after watching Alien. Couldn't we have strangling ears or a deadly projectile shooting nose instead? And why the damsel in distress? That trope is so tired, even Disney has dropped it in their latest animated films. Other than the one girl, there was the chubby kid, the Jewish kid, the total nerd, the asthmatic and the normal kid, who was cute, but had one defect of sorts. Hey, at least the one black kid doesn't die.That's not to say it wasn't mildly entertaining. It was. And the visuals were fantastic while the music didn't suck. Instead of spending more verbiage on a forgettable film, I will cut to the chase.Rating: Matinée. If you like horror films and hate clowns, it's worth a look. Otherwise, rent any of the above films or see The Amazing Wonder Ape World of Mexican Mutants instead.Peace, Tex Shelters",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great Reimagining,"This film had everything I was hoping for. As a huge Stephen King fan and reading a lot of his books, this is what I wanted. Sure, there were somethings that could have been better but overall, this was a great movie. Definitely if you compare the original TV adaptation to this one, there is nothing that rebuttals that this was better. The suspense and terror put on screen was exactly as it should have been. This film was great and if you are a horror fan like me this will definitely make you happy. If you were not afraid of clowns before this will definitely make you hate them now. Definite recommend.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
far too long for something without feeling or engagement.,"I was keen to see this, partly because of the Steven King origins but mainly because I was so impressed by the same director's Mama. However, it is a bit of a letdown. The CGI and special effects that everyone seems to complain about, I find fine and probably the best thing here. No, it is rather that this is really a very slight tale with so many big bangs and whistles at the expense of character development that there is nothing to care about. There are a couple of very worrying domestic scenes involving the beautiful Sophia Lillis that hold the attention but nothing else. Too much bullying, too many unfunny juvenile jokes, too much cycling in a group, oh and too much like a certain TV series. Even without the participation of Finn Wolfhard this bears a striking resemblance to Stranger Things and, okay, that may have been influenced by the writings of King but this is as if it is three episodes lashed together with all the charm, humour and adult involvement removed. Wonderfully good to look at but at over two hours far too long for something without feeling or engagement.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
IT is more of an adventure film and less of a horror and strongly reminds us of recent Stranger Things.,"IT (2017): While The Conjuring 2 is the most hyped horror film in 2016,IT has the credit as for 2017.Based on Stephen King's 1985 adventure horror novel which was made into a two part TV mini series back in 1990.That explains the hype around IT as all the 90's kids are waiting for Pennywise Clown to bring back their childhood memories of IT.But what about the newbies who never read the book or watched the TV Series?I belong to the mentioned category and watched IT with only vague idea about Pennywise Clown and interesting trailers which shows lot of scary promise.SO How is IT? Plot: When young children in the little town Derry, Maine goes missing a group of seven kids find out that the killer is not a man. The killer is the evil clown Pennywise who can shapeshift into the thing you are most afraid of. The kids, also known as the Losers Club, decide to fight and kill It. But how can you fight something who knows all your biggest fears? My Review: IT's opening scene is really one of the most nail biting scary scene in recent times.There is always a phrase ""What's hiding in Sewer's?"".The same phrase is given a brilliant visual where a kid named Georgie loses his paper boat which goes down the storm drain and he meets Pennywise there and the entire conversation raises the expectations on the movie.But after that scene,the movie completely changes into adventure mood which strongly resembles Netflix's Stranger Things.The entire first half of the movie depends on the children's friendship bonds and the way everyone encounter Pennywise in the form of their worst fears.Even the scenes aren't scary as Muschietti relies too much on your garden-variety jump scares and now-standard special effects, things like ghoulish limbs twisting every which-way and innocent figures shape-shifting into malevolent ones. As always, the horrors you get a close look at are much less terrifying than those that remain unseen.In latter half of the movie,the movie picks pace with continuous thrills in garage,and the spooky house.Pennywise is at its own but scary from during these scenes which promises hell ride once more but again the pace becomes repetitive with not so engaging climax.The interesting part is whenever a TV set is shown in the film,it features a kid program about adventure in sewers.Skarsgård,is quite effective as Pennywise. It helps that he's kinda scary looking even without makeup. But when you put him in that puffy, Elizabethan-style costume and give him that bulbous forehead and glowing, off-centre eyes, his impish smile can really creep you out.The young cast's performances are impressive too.So,IT is more of an adventure film and less of a horror and strongly reminds us of recent Stranger Things.My Rating 6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
...,The cheesy 1990 miniseries is far superior Despite the hype this adaptation was a real letdown The kids were great however the the CGI was awful and the jump scares were cheap Bill Skarsgard Hard to tell between him and the CGI This adaptation was lacking in both exposition and soul All we have here is a CGI clown terrorising some kids There is no depth to the story of his origins There is no proper backstory regarding the kids There is absolutely none of the feeling of dread that both the book and the original miniseries encapsulated No atmosphere whatsoever Its not a bad film but highly lacking.,,Anonymous,Horror
Scarier before I saw 'It',"Felt as though the scares were as artificial as most the terror. Too-polished, CGI-heavy effects that didn't land like I thought they would; didn't feel very palpable, and it was jarring from the tension. Having grown up traumatized by the original movie, my anticipation of the remake gave me more anxiety that the actual movie. Also seemed as though it took too many liberties with its own mythos for me to take it too seriously. I'll watch the 2nd chapter, but now with a dash of salted skepticism.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
We'll All Float On,"You'll float too.You'll be floating on air after seeing It. The creepiest, coolest film of 2017 so far. Easily, the most entertaining popcorn horror film in ages. Most of today's horror genre consists of dull jump-scare ghost movies and gnarly gore fests. It takes us back to the golden age of Horror, the 1980's. The film takes place sometime in 1989, complete with soundtrack and memorabilia. But the film itself could've easily been made in 89'. It's scary without being gratuitous. It's funny, without being a comedy. It's over-the-top, without being purposely terrible. It's got a standout cast of profane kids. Think of Stand By Me or The Goonies. You will sit back and smile away. You'll say to yourself ""If only every movie could be this way!"".Pennywise, while not played by the incomparable Tim Curry, is freighting in his new incarnation by Bill Skarsgard. This clown isn't a jokester. He's a shape shifting homicidal maniac and this time, that's a good thing. We have both versions and you can compare which one is superior if you wish, but you must concede that both are entirely different takes on the character and each stand on their own merits. The jump-scares all work here, which is something I don't usually say for horror movies. The creatures that Pennywise turns into are all terrifying and awe-inspiring. You may jump out of your seat, but you will appreciate the nuance.Seeing It in a large theater is also something you shouldn't go without doing. The audience reactions are priceless. The screams, the laughs, the shout outs! DON'T GO IN THERE! It was made to be a sheer crowd pleasure. An event of a movie and we sure are in need more of those.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
It is must to see!,"This new adaptation of Stephen King's monumental novel is one of the best that has been done in recent years based on some of his books, providing very charming characters and frightening sequences and capturing the unique qualities of King's storytelling. ""It"" is a solid horror movie with great protagonists who achieve that perfect combination of vulnerability to evil and fascination for the unknown and is carefully directed by Andy Muschietti. Despite all the marketing focus on the homicidal circus freak, ""It"" was never about the clown. It's about how trauma haunts a childhood and whether you're acquainted with the King novel or 90s movie, this new version will leave you breathless and probably sleepless, too.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

More Heart than Scare - Movie must,"I am not a scary/horror movie buff or even fan at that matter. The last scary movie I saw in was ""The Ring"" and I was only in the seat for the opening act then called my mom to come get me. Flash forward.I had to see 'IT"" (2017). From the first trailer, I was hooked. It is the CLASSIC horror flick revamped beautifully by Andrés Muschietti! I know and love the story of Pennywise and think the film covered his haunting backstory well. The young teen team up was hilarious to watch interact and conquer. That is where the HEART came in. I thought the movie was structured more like a coming of age film. I actually enjoyed the real-life terror of the town's seduction to Pennywise more than the audio queued jump scares. The C or D story about how the adults of the town live in a fog due to Pennywise's historic rule was my favorite aspect of the film. Still thinking that over.From one ""scaredy-cat"" to the next -- if you can handle the first crazy horror moment you are golden. Great theater movie. Enjoy!",,Anonymous,Horror
"A fun, enjoyable ride","Being more of a growing up tale than an horror , the movie focuses on the young characters ( for as much as possible given the runtime ) : Dialogues are on point and hilarious, they sound pleasantly childish, like it should be and the relationship between each other are most of the time well defined. Penniwise doesn't appear much, but that's not necessarily a defect : Although different from Curry's interpretation, this one is still a solid embodiment of the creature designed by King. Technically speaking, I never thought I would enjoy the score of an horror movie so much, it was really on point and extremely well done, as for the rest, directing and photography were pretty good and functional to the movie. Only complaint regards the tone of the film, which sometimes gets too much over the top with a few scenes",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A better remake,"I watched this film in Sheffield on the 13th of September. I had high expectations for this film - and IT exceeded them.The acting. Great performances all round. The kids had great chemistry, and you really believe that they were all great friends. It reminded me of Stand By Me and The Goonies. Out of the child actors, Richie (played by Finn Wolfhard) was my favorite and his jokes cracked the whole cinema up. Bill Skarsgård as Pennywise is scary and really creeped me out, but for me there was just something missing about his character and I think he wasn't given enough dialogue.A minor flaw for me was that the plot was a bit rushed, in terms with the development of Mike (played by Chosen Jacobs), but for an adaption from a book, they managed to condense the original material very well.Overall, it was a great film that kept me on the edge of my seat, with strong performances",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better as an adventure than as horror,"For once, Hollywood delivers a remake with heart and inspiration - and good screen writing. Bill Skarsgård is truly frightening as Pennywise.Director Andy Muschietti and his team have created that magical Spielberg-Zemeckis adventurous 80s feeling, also reminding of King-based ""Stand by Me"" (1986). The fine performances by the young cast, the quick, funny and good writing, the nice score by rising Benjamin Wallfisch and the cinematography by skilled South Korean Chung Chung- hoon (frequent collaborator of Park Chan-wook) all help in making ""It"" a well-working and enjoyable film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Half true horror, half South Park","Pennywise himself was definitely terrifying, and the way his jerky, unpredictable movement was shot makes you feel very uncomfortable. I usually find it hard to relate to film experts' analysis on cinematography, but even a layman like me could tell this was well done - when he emerges from the water I physically wanted to run away. What's more, he featured a lot, which was pleasantly surprising. We go to horror movies to be scared, and there were plenty of moments which achieved this, without it becoming tiresome.The cast is solid and the kids' dialogue amusing. However, what many people much more knowledgeable than me have seemed to agree on is that this really does feel like 10 minutes of coming-of-age then a few minutes of horror back and forth. I found the tone of the film difficult to establish. Unfortunately the story was a little muddled and though this only the 'first chapter', the subplots felt underdeveloped. The child actors themselves are talented yet the story very unbelievable, even if it is fiction. If I was one of those kids I'd be running like Bolt and singing like BB King...Overall it was a fun experience, nonetheless, and that is for someone who rarely visits the cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Rating: A,"By far, the best Stephen King's movie adaptation I've seen in years ... Well, I'm not saying much having in mind the most recent films, am I? So, to be absolutely clear: It is one of my favorite movies of this year!The story is very intriguing and mysterious during the whole runtime, therefore it doesn't allow a single dull moment or a misplaced scene. Tonally, the film switches between horror and slight bits of comedy (kids' banter) masterfully since it never feels that the funny moments are forced or without reason.Andy Muschietti flawlessly directs this movie. I honestly think it's one of those films that without this director, it wouldn't be even close to the success that it achieved. The way he explores and connects each one of the kids' fears and their backstory is truly unique, which elevates the screenplay even more. It's beautifully edited and the unconventional plot transforms It into something special.Even if Muschietti is technically perfect, the cast steals the whole show. I can't go through everyone, but keep in mind that every single one of the young actors has a fantastic performance. Besides, it's kind of awkward to point out flaws in kids' acting, but thankfully everyone is so great that I don't need to.Obviously, Bill Skarsgård is freaking terrifying as Pennywise. He's the cinematic proof that clowns can be strangely scary and I'm sure that now kids have a pretty good reason to fear them. Bill doesn't really show up as himself or without CGI that much, but when he does ... He portrays Pennywise brilliantly. From his laugh to his voice, he's perfect. Awesome job!Jaeden Lieberher plays Bill Denbrough, who is the main protagonist. He's the one that wants to find Pennywise at all costs and make him pay for all his crimes. Bill's story is remarkably emotional and compelling, something that Jaeden interprets amazingly. Sophia Lillis is a beautiful surprise as she represents Beverly Marsh! Her character's family issues and school problems make her feel real and she's probably the one who the audience is able to connect with better. Once again, another breakthrough performance from an unknown actress to me.Finn Wolfhard is by far the most recognized actor due to the success of Stranger Things. He plays Richie Tozier and if you ever saw one of Finn's interviews, you're not going to be astonished that Richie is basically Finn. He's the funny kid that's always teasing about the others' mothers and he's the main source of comedy through the whole movie. To my delight, he never gets annoying and the script for him is on-point.Finally, Jeremy Ray Taylor plays Ben Hanscom and he's the chubby kid that everyone loves because he's just so innocent and cute that everything he does and says is simply funny. The actor's expressions are hilarious, especially when he's sharing a scene with Sophia since their chemistry is marvelous.Actually, the whole cast's chemistry is off the charts, it feels like they have been friends since they were born! I also love the fact that this is a group of kids that entitles itself the ""losers"" gang since all of them suffer some kind of bullying, either from colleagues at school or from family members. This detail instantly relates to almost everyone in the audience so there's every reason to root for them right from the beginning.As for flaws, I can't really find anything big. The jump scares work really well, but some just follow the cliché setup and they don't effectively scare me. I might flinch, but apart from one scene that I admit I was caught completely off guard, it's pretty standard.The one thing that I didn't fancy at all is the way that the bullies are handled. Not that they aren't required, but there are a few moments that seem absurd and too far from reality. I can only understand why one of the bullies is harassing the ""losers"", but even that one does unimaginable things.All in all, It is one of 2017's best films and it's undoubtedly the best horror movie of this year. Andy Muschietti flawless directing skills elevate the screenplay and the scary scenes are indeed very creepy. However, the cast strongly shines with special praise to Jaeden Lieberher, Sophia Lillis, Finn Wolfhard, Jeremy Ray Taylor and, of course, Bill Skarsgård as the terrifying and beautifully designed, Pennywise. Excellent tone balance, amazing storytelling and great character development throughout the whole runtime, with the exception of the bullies that seem a bit off and even absurd.MSB Reviews | Full Spoiler-Free review on my blog :)",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than I expected,"Not the biggest horror or King guy, but this was better than I thought I would be. It had a real Stranger Things vibe which worked, but the constant need to fall back on jump scares hurt it.

Fantastic horror film!,"I was very excited to see this one. I been waiting for more than a year after it was announced. So I am happy to tell you this exceeds all expectations! Let me begin withBill Skarsgård. He was amazing as pennywise! I mean very very menacing, creepy, and played his character so great! I adored the kids in this movie! They had great chemistry, and you can really buy that they are best friends! Something I loved that this film did was it didn't have any exposition. It was all visual story telling. You can tell what scared the kids, without them just saying ""(this) scares me"" they develop their characters until you eventually find out on your own. There are many scenes or moments that finally tie into the story at the end. I loved the effort put into this movie! And of course, the horror in It is so scary! Not the typical jump scare, false scare, loud noise, predictable scare fest we are used to with a majority of horror films now a days. The scares were very unique! Some people might complain the scares were too over the top, but it's supposed to be imagination. The emotion towards the end works so well. It made me feel sad. And last, the humor worked so good! It was very funny and all jokes landed! I would say my issues with the film is I wanted more screen time with pennywise. He wasn't in a lot of it until the third act. And my last issue, I wish there wasn't as many jokes and whatnot during scenes that are supposed to be frightening. But other than that definitely go out and see this one, good date night, or hanging out with friends! You will be chilled to the bone!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

IT Delivers the Scares and Humor in an Endlessly Fun Ride,"Don't overthink it. Don't overthink IT.That's a plea from the novel's author himself, Stephen King. He didn't want anyone to delve too deeply into analyzing this movie, so respect the man's wishes. He knows his work better than anyone else possibly could. After all, he wrote it.I understand the temptation to explore the layers of IT. We see the themes of community, transitioning to adulthood, bullying, racism, friendship, yada, yada, yada. I'm telling you—don't fixate on that. Focus on IT. And by IT, I mean not only Pennywise the Dancing Clown, but also the embodiment of all your worst fears, everything that IT can be. Because that's what this movie is really about above all else—being afraid.This 2017 adaptation of IT provides a litany of reasons to be afraid, not the least of which is Bill Skarsgard's terrifying, devious, vicious performance of the infamous clown. This is very much of modern version of Pennywise, equipped with special effects to illustrate his shape-shifting abilities and showcase his considerable power.There's nothing cheesy here. Pennywise is only ever funny and charming as a means to lure children. The humor is intentional when it hits.The most brilliant element of IT is its self-recognition. The movie (or its writers) understands that stories of this ilk (i.e. an unstoppable monstrous figure is killing people) are inherently kind of silly. Take Michael Myers, for example. Sure, his is scary, but he is also partly ridiculous and silly because it's ridiculous and silly to believe that a human child would ever turn into an unstoppable killing machine that has no reason for killing and also cannot be killed by gun shots or fire or seemingly anything else. The movie makers understand this and respond accordingly by embracing the silly: they make the unstoppable killer a dancing circus clown.Now, I understand that to many people clowns are terrifying even if they aren't killing anyone. That's fair. Clowns don't really stir up those fears in me, but I find dolls endlessly creepy, so I get it. The fact remains that Pennywise most commonly takes the form of a clown, and clowns are silly. So, the movie also contains some appropriate silliness. The kids make crude jokes. A lot of them. Some of the things that Pennywise does blur the lines between silly and scary. Certain scenes, or at least certain moments within scenes, can be perceived as either scary or silly.The movie navigates this blend of silly and scary brilliantly. The scares begin early and strike with ferocity. The jump scares come only as necessary; they do not wear out their welcome. There's also a satisfying sprinkle of disturbing images and prolonged stints of dread to deliver frights. Many of the scariest moments contain no surprise element. The movie simply presents a terrifying image then shoves in down your throat until you gag on the creepiness. If this sounds uncomfortable that's because it is.After moments like those, the silliness provides a much-needed dash of comic relief to ease the tension. Other times the silliness lulls the audience into a false sense of security before slapping them in the face with something horrifying. This makes for an unpredictable and endlessly entertaining thrill ride.Entertainment is the primary goal of this movie, perhaps the only goal. With that in mind, don't think too much about how absurdly useless or villainous the adult characters are portrayed. Don't think too much about the one-dimensional and token nature of many child characters. Most of all, don't think too much about how this movie is different from the book (books and movies are separate entities; of course they are going to be different!).Don't overthink this movie. Just sit back and enjoy the silliness and scares. From the spectacular opening scene to the warm and comforting conclusion, this movie aims to entertain. It delivers.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

We all float,"Re watching the movie after reading a majority of the book I have to say I rather enjoyed this film, compared to its previous TV 2 part mini movie. The film is within it's right to be it's own thing or different, whilst also paying homage to the book.Characters are played very well some have their character over played to their description in the book but yet that can be brushed off. The late 80s vibes to the film is nostalgic and yet it also feels modern.
The acting and effects that go into Bill's pennywise is phenomenal and extremely entertaining.Some effects are choppy and some main/important points from the book are missing along the film.
Yeah the film has its flaws and weak points and may too feel rushed but it works, not all films or moments will scare you and that's just you but this film needs to people to move on from the 1990s film and understand that not all films which is 100% true to the original source material will work or is best.

Starts Too Strong but Still a Good Hour and a Half,"Unfortunately its two and a half hours. I liked this movie, it was a good movie for the most part and the first ten minutes are extremely scary. Pennywise in the sewer, luring a child closer before ultimately stealing him away is one of the most memorable scenes I have seen this year. Unfortunately, it sets the bar too high for the rest of the movie and it never reaches that point again. An the simple reason is that it hows too much. There is no mystery as to what Pennywise does, it lays everything out on the bed like the clothes did for you when you were twelve. He rips a kid's arm off for God's sake, there is no reason to feel that Billy is justified in that his brother still may be alive somewhere when we just saw the kid get ate nor any reason to wonder what happened to the other kids that went missing. This makes the movie grow stale after a while, it still good for a while but eventually it overstays its welcome.Perhaps that makes it a problem, there is too much Pennywise. At the very least too much direct activity from him. Skarsgard was good at the role, he was wonderfully imposing in front of the young cast but was fairly single minded. He is there to eat kids, and that was pretty much it. He lacks the maliciousness of Tim Curry, who drew far more pleasure tormenting his victims before the hunt. Skarsgard instead pops up in just about every scene, not as a malevolent presence but as a physical flesh and blood monster chasing the kids around around with little exception. As I said, there is no mystery about him and his intent is abundantly clear. Seeing him again becomes less about his intentions and more the signal for the next chase. Its still scary but gradually is hurt by diminishing returns. I was done after the haunted crack house but still had the final confrontation in the sewers to go through.The movie also managed to hit my biggest pet peeve, swearing children. Smart mouthed children are fine, even though he was supposed to be annoying I was fine with Richie from the TV movie, but in this day and age it seems to be that wise guy means foul mouthed little brat. This Richie is especially egregious, from credits to credits every line has to have a swear or mention of the size of his penis.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Even the most annoying kid who can say nothing right at any time, you still don't want him to die.Overall I'd say a solid 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
It Subverts Expectations With Well Drawn Characters and an Interesting Yet Scary Story,"*Minor Spoilers Ahead* IT begins in 1988 where Georgie (Jackson Robert Scott) is trying to take his paper boat to sail out in the rain. His brother Bill (Jaeden Lieberher) would normally go with him but he's feeling under the weather. Georgie takes his boat out and it races down the street with the rain and the prevailing current. The boat takes a turn into the sewers and when Georgie bends down to reach it, he discovers Pennywise ""The Dancing Clown"" (Bill Skarsgard). Pennywise is maybe too friendly and while Georgie is apprehensive of him at first, Pennywise coaxes him closer to the drain. He promises to give him his boat back but Georgie is snatched and dragged into the sewer.One year later, more kids are vanishing yet the adults seem to either not notice or don't care. Bill and his friends: Richie (Finn Wolfhard), Eddie Kaspbrack (Jack Dylan Grazer), Stanley (Wyatt Oleff), Mike (Chosen Jacobs), Ben (Jeremy Ray Taylor) and Beverley (Sophia Lillis) are all separately visited by Pennywise and experience nightmares. Together, they combine their efforts to face him and discover how through their friendship, they can overcome anything.A lot of movies about kids don't trust kids to be able to handle some of the tougher subjects. I've read a few of Stephen King's books and a consistent theme is the dirtier side of small town living. IT has that at the forefront and I think its a better movie for it. Sure, it will make for some uncomfortable moments for more sensitive viewers but the problems facing The Losers Club (minus Pennywise) are all very real. I can't say really young kids should watch this movie, it can be graphic. But instead of shying away from how dark King's material, they play into it and it really helped ground the movie.So while they don't shy away from the dark environment facing these kids, the other big surprise from this movie was how they put the time in to make you care about these kids. I can't remember the last time a horror movie made me feel this scared for the potential victims. None of these kids deserve the fate that Pennywise would subject them to. They aren't dealing with Twilight or Degrassi problems, these are some very serious issues (almost homicidal bullies, possible sexual assault, dealing with the premature death of a young sibling, hypochondria etc.) and I felt for every single one of these kids. It also helps you get attached to their friendship, camaraderie is hard to buy unless its done right but IT excels at that. When they must band together to face this evil, instead of it being corny, I bought into it and I wanted them to survive.Moving from developing the characters, the actors/actresses more than carry their share of the load. They did a great job finding capable kid actors and they all shine. If I had to single out a couple of them, I would credit Jaeden Lieberher, Sophia Lillis, Jack Dylan Grazer and Jeremy Ray Taylor as being the standouts. Where child actors usually struggle, they thrived in this movie. I also have to tip my hat to Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise. He's helped up by some impressive special effects but he makes Pennywise threatening and lends an unpredictable element to the character that may not have come through with another actor.IT is being advertised as the next great horror movie and while I'm happy to report that IT is genuinely frightening, it isn't perfect. There are scenes filled with terror (my favourite is a scary set piece with a slide projector) and there are even some really funny scenes. This is mostly carried by the character Richie who is vulgar but completely believable (so many dick jokes). My only complaint is that while Pennywise is motivated to frighten the children first, he beats around the bush a lot. He is so powerful and his abilities are crazy, there were so many times where he had these kids isolated and vulnerable and for no reason he didn't kill them. It was just one of those situations where the villain is more concerned in playing with his food more than getting the job done and there isn't a believable reason why.I had some minor problems with IT but very little of those issues coloured my overall opinion of this movie. With all the hype surrounding IT, this could have been a big letdown. But this movie was excellent and I get why so many people are going nuts over IT. With this being advertised as chapter 1, I'm excited to see the next entry in this potential series. If you're in the mood for some backwater horror thrills, IT could be the film you're looking for. I would grade IT at 8.5/10 rounding up to a 9. IT also might make you scared of clowns and make you double-take at red balloons as a side-effect. Keep that in mind as the trade-off.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Wasn't that bad at all,"I was originally worried when they mentioned the remake of 'IT', considering the book is one of my favorites from Stephen King, and the 1990 mini-series was cool (at the time).Have to admit though, this remake was alright (and I have seen some horrible ones in the last couple of years). The best part of this remake was Skarsgard who played Pennywise almost exactly how I had envisioned him when I read the book. While I loved Tim Curry, who made Pennywise evil, if not a little fun, Skarsgard made Pennywise seem deranged/psychotic/creepy. The movie itself was slow in some areas, but I chalk it up to character development of the kids, especially since this is just part 1. Still doesn't quite follow the book, but more so than the 1990 version.Cheers",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A more faithful adaptation of the book,"I don't care what anyone says, The Dark Tower was a good movie. Now, if I say The Dark Tower is a good movie, imagine what I think of It. It was awesome. I loved It. Yes, whenever I write the It, It will be capitalized. Even though I did love It, and I problem should have given It a higher rating, but there was a couple of major problems I did have with the movie. I'm not in any way shape or form comparing the movie to the book, I do hate when people do that, but the problems are there and they're major. In the book, all of the members of the Loser's Club had their time to shine. Stephen King made It so there was definitely not a single Loser that stood out more than the others, even though Bill was the defacto leader. Still, there was no centralized main character out of the group. The movie made It so It concentrated solely on Bill and his vendetta with It. Then we have the problem with Bev Marsh. Some of this stems from the movie, and a very small part comes from the casting choose of who everyone wants to play the elder Bev. The small part has nothing to do with this movie unless the cast the wrong person for Chapter 2. But, Bev was not a love interest, nor a sex symbol to the boys. She also wasn't a damsel in distress. She was a strong young lady when she was in school, and a hidden warrior when she was an adult. There was no reason to downplay her abilities. I mentioned It above, but there was one thing that seriously hurt the movie for me. I said that they mostly concentrated on Bill, well that concentration almost took Mike Hanlon right out of the movie. Almost ruined the whole thing for that character. Enough of the things that I didn't like about It. On to the good. Even though they changed the end of the battle (and I won't tell you what they did in the movie, go watch It) I did like how they ended It. They completely set up for a sequel. Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise was long shot from the jump, but it paid off. He didn't play off what Tim Curry did, and he didn't do better. He did his own thing. And that's what made it memorable. As for what the director did with the way of bringing him to screen, it was more close to the book than anything. He was much more menacing this time round. Can't really say much about the story. Of course they had to leave a few things out. Some were for different reasons than pacing, but they were left out all the same. The things, and the Easter eggs, that did make the movie were the right choices. Got right down to the meat and potatoes of It. I told myself I didn't want to do this, but It's all I've been thinking about seen I watched the movie. And here is my casting choices for the main characters of It: Chapter 2. Bill – Christian Bale Bev – Maggie Gyllenhaal Ben – I would say Jake Gyllenhaal normally, but Maggie is the perfect choice for Bev so I have to move to my second choice in Chris Pratt Eddie – Jesse Pinkman himself Aaron Paul Richie – James Franco Stan – Seth Rogan Mike – Chadwick BosemanMost people aren't looking at Henry Bowers in all this, but I have made a choice myself. A little out of left field, but I think he could easily pull it off.Henry Bowers – Jackie Earl HaleyRating: 8 out of 10That's it for me folks.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not so scary,"As a suspense film it is good, it is not my style of film, but as it was being much talked about at the time and I wanted to watch more of Stephen King's works, I decided to see it. The quality of the effects, script and performance are really undeniable, but I didn't find it as scary as I heard so much saying, in fact I laughed more during the film than anything else, mainly because of the constant mistakes made by the children, who in a moment they said to do such a thing and seconds later they did another ... Actor Bill Skarsgård was great as 'IT', he understood and represented the character very well. Even children, have a great future as actors, because they also knew how to give themselves to each character. But I expected something much more frightening, which did not happen, so, for me, it is more of a tension and suspense film than of horror. In Game of Thrones there were scenes that disturbed me a lot more ... I never got to read the book, but based on what I've already read from Stephen King, surely the mistake of this adaptation, as of all others, is the lack of sensitivity when trying to translate the internal tensions, feelings and conflicts that each character goes through and that gives the whole tone of his stories, because when trying to adapt them, this always seems to be forgotten, they focus too much on trying to put frightening external elements, that jump to each scene, instead of showing what is really scary in King's stories, which are the internal demons that each character discovers about theirselves and how it affects them, with and despite the monsters around them. For those who like this style of film, they will certainly like it, but for those who are interested in reading the books before, watch without waiting too much, just as another film to be distracted.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Brilliant mixture of a coming-of-age drama and a supernatural horror movie,"IT offers an excellent mixture of a coming-of-age drama and a supernatural horror movie. What I like about this film adaptation is how the film respects both sides on a perfectly balanced level. We are introduced to the lives of outcast teenage boys and one teenage girl who have to deal with severe cases of bullying, complicated family issues and their conflicting feelings for one another. As if that weren't enough to deal with, they also realize that the fact that numerous kids have been abducted in their hometown Derry isn't a mere coincidence. Behind its peaceful, calm and boring small town appearance, Derry seems to be a cursed place with a hideous past where a mysterious supernatural entity feeds on children's fears before consuming them literally. The outcast teenagers decide to take action and stop the monstrous entity with their curiosity, friendship and perseverance as weapons.IT takes place in the late eighties and this movie manages to take its audience back in time thanks to the timeless small town buildings, particular hairstyles and clothes and a fitting soundtrack. The film works so efficiently because it's easy for the audience to picture itself in these settings during their childhood years. The acting performances only increase this movie's authenticity. The teenagers all have different strengths and weaknesses and are refreshingly grounded and normal which is a welcome alternative to the popular world of superheroes and super-villains. The movie also has a strong cultural and intellectual side as it includes many allusions and references to Stephen King's other works. Some examples for this would be the town of Derry that serves regularly as setting for Stephen King's novels, the friendship between outcast teenagers in the key of Stand by Me and several allusions to thrash metal band Anthrax that has written numerous lyrics inspired by Stephen King's novels.You won't see the one hundred fifteen minutes pass as this immersive movie is very entertaining thanks to its mysterious story, authentic settings and profound characters. Due to the fact that the film takes place in the eighties, it is quite accessible for adults who will experience numerous deja-vu moments but its timeless brilliance should also be appealing to older teenagers who might easily identify with one or several characters in the movie. IT is a late summer blockbuster you shouldn't miss.On a closing side-note, this movie is the first part of a duology. The content of this movie takes place in the late eighties while the second movie is supposed to show what the characters, the supernatural entity and the town have become twenty-seven years later with some flashbacks from the past. These two story lines are similar to the way the original novel was written. You can watch this movie separately from the sequel but it wouldn't be possible to watch the sequel without watching this first instalment.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A Straightforward Frightfest! More brutal, violent and horrific than predecessor!","It is not a film that disappoints the genre it represents at all. The scenes depicted in the trailer are not the only scary or climatic parts of the film either and are cut well to misdirect what the viewer expects to happen. This a full steam ahead something(Pennywise) wants to catch you and kill you suspense horror film. The psychological horror aspect is present as the antagonist preys on the characters fears of course but that is all.In recent years successful horror films have succeeded in a welcome misdirection from jump scares and building on the viewers anxiety. Well crafted tales like Conjuring, The Ring and Insidious all excellent horror films are examples of this. It(2017) is an excellent horror film but in another manner. There is the psychological horror but more than that it is a welcome return to one of the genres most beloved and terrifying themes the boogeyman. A boogeyman that above all else just wants to capture and kill kids. Just explaining this sounds frightening.I enjoyed the It miniseries from years back and for a TV movie it was achieved in retelling the novel in dramatic fashion. This film tells the master of horrors story in horrific fashion. Myself and the group I saw this with all enjoyed IT and had no negative feelings whatsoever.My rating of 8 out of 10 could without question be higher if not for issues with the audience in the theater. Half way through the film I had to exit the theater and report to management the few rotten apples ruining the film by talking through most of the film.*Note* I missed a crucial part of the middle act as it is intolerable and impossible to enjoy a film with private conversations being carried on in the theater. I strongly urge fellow film goer's if this happens do not endure this or confront the ignorant party disturbing the film.Confrontations just make more disturbances simply go to the box office and demand a refund. I had to do just this and while I returned and saw the rest of the film. The obnoxious parties were scolded, embarrassed and told they would be ejected from the theater if their disruption continued.I look forward to reviewing It without interruption and was thrilled with the film overall.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
FINALLY a great Stephen King Adaptation,"Was I skeptical upon entering that cinema? Absolutely.Stephen King is a notoriously difficult author to adapt to screens big and small, and after seeing the recent remake of ""Carrie"" I had my share of doubts about whether these filmmakers could pull this of.My fears disappeared fairly quickly.""It"" is a fantastic movie, a well-scripted, well-directed and well- acted piece of high-quality entertainment. Let's talk about those actors: each and every one of those child actors did an AMAZING job. I sympathized with, cared for and cheered for all of them. A spectacular job across the board. I predict that all these fine young actors (but maybe Sophia Lillis in particular) have great futures in store for them.The young adult aspects of the film are so compelling that I almost didn't care about the horror aspect. Essentially, even if the film had messed up Pennywise, I still feel like it would have been a great time. But Bill Skarsgård and the crew did a great job with the dancing clown as well, making him and his surroundings fittingly creepy. I was never once terrified, but consider that a good thing. The film utilizes jump scares, true, but it never becomes overly reliant on them.I have very few complaints about this movie. It was both entertaining and emotionally satisfying with a great cast, great atmosphere and surprisingly great humor. Check it out!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

"A short review of""It"" (2017)","""It"" (2017) succeeds on a number of levels; it's both an excellent horror movie in its own right and a faithful adaptation of Stephen King's incredible 1986 novel. It's rate it a 9 out of 10.The movie works so well because it captures the book's key juxtaposition of sweetness with horror. There is a gentle innocence about the story's circle of adolescent protagonists, who remain kind and good in King's story — despite facing an incredibly powerful monster while being alienated by adults who are shifty, feckless, or monstrous themselves. The screenwriters understand that juxtaposition, and successfully bring it to the screen. The kids here feel real, three-dimensional, quirky and damned likable. (My favorite was Eddie, the wisecracking hypochondriac, played by Jack Dylan Grazer.) It adds great tension to the story.And the monster itself is truly terrific, thanks to an inspired, menacing portrayal by Bill Skarsgard and startling visual direction that nicely summons summons both coulrophobia and grotesque (yet sometimes subtle) body horror.The film might suffer just a little from something its makers couldn't avoid — so many of its basic story elements are overly familiar tropes. King wrote his novel more than 30 years ago. ""Scary"" clowns are now omnipresent in popular culture. (It's something I'll never understand. Clowns are mysteriously and positively irritating to me. They're a lot like David Tennant before ""Jessica Jones."") We've also seen more than a few alienated adolescents, period settings and shape-shifting monsters that impersonate our worst fears, in everything form ""The X-Files"" to ""Stranger Things"" to  other Stephen King adaptations. We don't want the filmmakers to neglect these key story components. That would ruin the movie. But they feel like overly common tropes in 2017.Still, this was a great fright flick. I can't wait for Part 2.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

A gift to you Stephen King fans,"Stephen King has been Hollywood's most reliable author when it comes to adaptations. There are 58 movies and TV shows based on his works. Some were really good (The Shawshank Redemption, The Shining, Misery) and some were just plain awful (Cell, Maximum Overdrive, Dreamcatcher). This year two movies were released based on his works. The Dark Tower, based on his fantasy series which he considered to be his magnum opus, was a major disappointment. So King fanboys have a big expectation for this one.The source material has already got an adaptation before. The 1990 TV movie 'IT' was fairly well-known, thanks to Tim Curry's creepy performance as Pennywise. He did what Steven Spielberg did to sharks. So with this movie casting an unknown kid for the role of Pennywise, people were worried. But boy oh boy did he knocked it outta the park. He portrayed the evil clown with a madness similar to Jared Leto's portrayal of The Joker. Not only Pennywise, but the members of the Loser's Club (the group of friends in the fictional town of Derry) were all great in this movie. They showed great acting skills as well as great chemistry between one another.What sets IT apart from the other horror movies, is that IT isn't all about jump scares and scary faces. It was also about growing up, facing your fears and in a way, it is also a study about the very fabrics of fear. So when you think that this film is only about a dancing clown and gruesome murders (which is partly true), think again.The haunting scenes aren't really what scares us. Though it was brilliantly executed, a lot of movies have done better jobs. The personal situations surrounding our fellow characters and even the town of Derry were the ones that really disturbs us. Therefore, when viewers said that the movie wasn't really scary, they may be right. Because this movie doesn't want to scare you, it wants to disturb you.In the end, IT was a great horror movie. Not only because it is frightening, but also because it was disturbing. They did this without sacrificing the element of fun. Which explains the huge opening box office this movie received. With the adaptation being this good, I bet King fans will forgive Hollywood for The Dark Tower.",,Anonymous,Horror
"More funny than scary, even to me, who watched it at 12","This movie was really fun to watch, not once did I ask how much left was in the movie because I was so IN it. This movie, unlike other horror movies I have seen, I could watch multiple times. The jokes were all really funny and I really like all the characters and the way they act around eachother. The horror, though, was FUN, but not very scary unless you find jumpscares terrifying. This movie had many jumpscares, and they became the main form of fear for the movie, instead of real, creepy moments, but like I said, it was still really fun to watch. Also, the CGI and special effects were very... weird. Not necessarily bad, but not good at all, it was all very twitchy. I liked how each character had their own fear and storyline to go with it. Overall, this movie was very fun to watch, had pretty good pacing, the only downside is that it was unexpected because the humor showed up more than the fear.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Loved this adaptation,"I loved the book and I loved this adaptation. I don't understand the flippant negative reviews of this film because it was very well thought out and wonderfully acted. I've been a fan of Stephen King since I read the Dead Zone 30 years ago, and this version of It is among the very best cinematic adaptations of his work, right up there with Stand By Me and Carrie. i think it speaks volumes that King himself was not prepared for how good the film would be and saw it twice when it was first released. Yes, there are major differences from the book and this is the first of two films, but it captures well the feel of the original novel, and the relationships between the young characters are nicely developed. The film is terrifying at times, but many of the scary scenes have an underlying sadness that gives them extra depth. One of my favourite scary movies, without a doubt.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Nothing like a little fear to make a paper man crumble""",I was first introduced to Stephen Kings IT back in the 90s when I was a kid watching the IT mini series on VHS and after seeing Tim Curry's performance as Pennywise the Clown from that point on I had a fear of Clowns.Now if your like me and you watched the original mini series back in the 90s then chances are your not really going to enjoy this remake as much as the original and not because it's a bad movie or even a bad adaptation of the book it's just different from the original mini series mainly because the mini series was more quiet and intense it's budget was nothing compared to movies in the modern day and it was developed for television so the violence and bad language had to be very minimal so instead we got a slow and interesting story that built up fear with clever writing and short but intense scenes with pennywose as he terrorised the losers club in dark often comedic ways so when pennywise finally attacked the losers club it was scary to watch as he showed his teeth ready to feast on them.IT 2017 follows the same storyline as the original give or take a few minor changes to the story as an excuse to fill it full of 80s nostalgic references and call backs the movie also uses a lot of CGI which is disappointing the scenes that do use practical effects look good but just there's so few of them to enjoy but the main issue I had with the movie is just how unnecessarily loud and in your face the scene's with Pennywise are there's no real tension in the scenes with Pennywise and the losers club he just runs at them shouting and drooling at the mouth while typical jump scare music and children's voices play very loudly over what is supposed to be a scary scene when really all it does is give you a headache and makes you blink a lot from all the flashing it's pretty funny that with all today's modern technology they can't make a single horror movie that is actually scary and practical for a new generation this is the norm and they will enjoy the movie but if you were around in the 80s and 90s it just makes you wish you could go back to the days when horror movies were actually scary and innovative.With all that being said the movie is still well shot and is very colourful and makes good use of modern day camera technology to give us a great looking film.All the actors involved really do their best and all give a fantastic performance they all do a great job giving their characters individual personalities and quirks Bill Skarsgard is ok as Pennywise at least for a new generation but for me and a lot of other people Tim Curry will always be Pennywise and will always be the reason I am scared of real clowns.I recommend watching this movie at least once because it isn't a bad movie but just don't go into it expecting it to be a upgrade to the original mini series because you will be very disappointed.,6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Disturbing, dark, depressing even, and downright delightful","""It."" A story about kids in Derry who must band together to fight an other-worldly terror that preys on children and others in the small town of Maine. A haunting thrill throughout, with scares and laughter and even traumatic moments, this film is evidence horror is still very much alive today, and that the idea of sequels and remakes must not be dismissed.Overall, the film is a knockout. The makers of ""It"" evidently put thought and heart into the remake of the 90's classic made-for-TV hit and a great mix of what is in the original book by Stephen King and what the filmmakers decided would be original ideas to bring the story effectively to the big screen.There is so much that makes the movie worth it. It captures the essence of King's novel by bringing back some memorable elements, such as lines, characters, atmosphere, and the very fear that the children experience. And like the novel, there is humor throughout, to remind the audience that despite what the children go through, and despite the mature decisions they must make, they are still just children, alone in their conflicts from the adult world. It follows the book just enough to satisfy any fan of Stephen King (unlike some films *coughcoughDARKTOWERcough*), and even impress the man himself. Aside from similarities to the book and maybe even the 90's film, the film stands on its own, so people unfamiliar with King's work and the original film can easily understand and enjoy it, while a King fan will be delighted to see Pennywise in a new light, and enjoy classic moments (beep beep Richie!!).There are some elements that are disagreeable, but not many and they still can't bring my perfect score down. First of all, too much CGI. It seems to be used as a cop-out in films these days, a crutch. However, for the most part it is well used and effective. There are jumps scenes, something that many feel is a cheap scare. Chances are fairly good those people would still be caught off guard by some of them in this movie. Some may find parts cheesy, some may find the whole thing cheesy, so while the CGI and scares may be a problem for some, many will find them quite enjoyable. The scares truly are different, and terrifying.There also doesn't seem to be near enough character development, and it feels like you don't get to know each of the children enough, save maybe Bill and Bev only. But this is evidence of filmmakers pandering to the needs of the ever-changing audience, as modern general viewers sometimes get bored of the legendary Hitchcock-ian pace. The film moves very rapidly from the start and keeps the flow going throughout the film. Sometimes it feels like the characters don't even get much of a break in the last half of the film, but that's what happens when you try to fit a cinderblock-thick novel into two movies. You do however get to know the kids enough to get by, and it doesn't impede the progress of the plot.The acting even is favorable. Sometimes wooden, most of the time genuine. There are times when you truly feel what the children are feeling, and occasionally cause a stir of emotions. And let's not leave out Pennywise. We all know how difficult it would be to fill Tim Curry's clown shoes. But fear not, this new dancing clown is no circus. Demented and frightening, he will toy with the children's minds, and leave symbolic bite marks on viewers' souls.I have a personal beef with those reviewers who say it's nothing like the book and nothing like the works of Stephen King. These people are posers and have obviously never read ""It"" or any of King's novels, so take their reviews with a grain of salt.This story is an adult horror from a child's perspective. Fears from our childhood was a major influence on King's work, and ""It"" was its epitome. A must-see, but not for everybody, especially the feint of heart. It is a dark, evil, twisted fall down the rabbit's hole, and this rabbit has teeth. LOTS of teeth.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not so much a scary movie, but entertaining nonetheless.","If you're reviewing this movie from a 'I'm watching this for the horror component' standpoint, well you'd be utterly disappointed. IT is a horrible horror movie. The jump scares are predictable, the use of CGI is definitely laughable and it just isn't scary(unless you're 12 or younger).HOWEVER, that being said, the movie is fairly funny and the young cast is definitely entertaining. Their stories aren't developed enough. I don't blame the movie though, the runtime isn't enough to fully encapsulate the kids' stories and personality. But for the amount of runtime given, the movie did a pretty good job of trying to develop the characters. The ending is a let down too.Instead of watching this movie in hopes of being scared, watch it for the relationships between the kids, it is pretty touching and it shows the novelties of childhood.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Generic scares but good acting and characters.,"I saw this in the cinemas so those of you who are reading this years after its release must contend with the fact that horror films tend to be more intense and scary on a big screen, in front of a large thrilled audience, so take that into account when reading this. Those of you who will or have watched this on your phone, you're missing out on the full experience. Always watch intense movies like horror films in a cinema.Anyway, this movie was pretty entertaining. The plot was pretty simplistic: A gang of young misfits must band together to defeat a demonic enemy that has the ability to shape shift, invade their thoughts and make them hallucinate. This of course creates loads of opportunities for scares. The scares don't come in the most original of ways and there's the usual whooshing sounds to accompany the scares. I actually recognised that clichéd thx sound where the volume goes up at the start of a thx certified film. I find that annoying and unoriginal but along with all the other elements builds a compelling effective and scary story. But its not the scares that makes this film great.Its the chemistry between these young actors that rewards your viewing. They really care about each other and so we in turn want them to survive. There is no ""save the cat"" scene to make us like them. Nothing manipulative like that, just good kids with good hearts. Their friendship also explores side themes of sexual awakening, the gaining of courage and loyalty. It also makes a good point about self esteem for kids that feel out of place in their own home, town and skin.The young actors, all of whom I've never heard of before, really work well together. I am guessing they were cast based on the great chemistry between them and not simply getting the most high profile individuals actors, as is usually the case with Hollywood films.Tim Curry was brilliant as the titular character ""IT"" in the original released in 1990. In this film we don't have a brilliant actor in his role. In fact rather than replicating Tim Curry's acting ability with raw talent, this film uses computer generated imagery to make the monster grin, snarl and scream instead, so you if you were planning on seeing how the new actor's performance compares to Curry's genius turn, you'll be disappointed. I thought this took away from the movie, but I've seen the original, so this may not be an issue for you.In conclusion this film is a solid horror film. Its well made with great attention to detail. This isn't one of those films that was made as a quick grab for cash as is the case with many remakes. It can hold its head high. Its a polished impressive work of youthful horror.",,Anonymous,Horror
It was good!,"I usually don't watch horror movies because I get scared easily, but I enjoyed It! It was more about jump scares I guess and I loved the cast!Pennywise was scary!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Classic: kids in a horror movie, works every time","This movie consists of brilliant acting accompanied with an amazing story that is executed to high standards. It is also an excellent remake of the original Stephen King's IT. The classic kids in a horror movie works weel for this movie as it acts as a juxtaposition between the innocence of children and the evil of Penny-wise the dancing clown. Many horror movies will use this classic cliche, however this movie stands out with its extraordinary acting and unsuspecting plot points. As the audience you are inticed in the screen and feel as though you are living the story in reality with these innocent children, evoking more fear. After you finish the movie the idea of Penny-wise remains in your mind, sending shivers down your spine.

A clown curse! The past legends haunt a town and it's kids!,"I never read the Stephen King novel ""It"" as his works are long and drawn out, still I knew it's popular take and I like horror films so naturally I checked out this big screen take. And really this picture has plenty of gore, blood, and fright scenes to try and to be scary in an old fashioned kind of way! The story is simple it takes place in Maine upstate in a small town and the kids all around seem to have a problem of disappearing and seeing sightings of a strange clown, as one by one it's not safe to go out as a curfew is in place all over town. Yet thru history and research it's found that these clowns and missing children have been around for decades it's like it's a history curse. And these kids in town have their own problems of being bullied, yet never fear the clown eats and kills the bad bullies too! Overall pretty good take that's with plenty of blood, gore, and murder it does it's best to bring out fright and fear.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not as good as the 90's original,"As far as I knew it would be a sequel, it made sense to me that it began with the kids crafting the paper boat. The first dialogue with It was scarier than the original version and the aftermath as well. I didn't like the computerized clown shaking, it was like he was boiling. Anyways, the final result was good. The several teeth was also more shocking. Concerning the kids, the original girl was sweeter and innocent. That empowered girl version didn't please me. The original kids had more chemistry and better acting skills, but this version's were also convincing after all. I missed a sense of terror and suspense the original version had. Maybe I'm too old comparing to the first time I've seen It in the 90's.",,Anonymous,Horror

One of the best Horror movies of the year and one of the best interpetration of Pennywise,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time, I loved this movie from start to finish. Bill Skardgard is great in playing Pennywise, he nails it, I loved everything that this movie showed us. Most of the scenes are really graphic and scary to see. That scene at the house where the Losers meet Pennywise for the first time was so beautiful to see and just a wonderful Pennywise played by Bill. The design of Pennywise is just well made and every scene he was in it just stole the show, The kids were perfectly cast and an absolute near perfect film. I loved it one of my favorite movies in quite some time.

Feeding on your fears! [+67%],"'It' has a spectacular opening scene. Little Georgie goes out to play in the rain with his new boat (made by his brother Bill) but finds himself encountering an eerie-looking clown in a sewer. Here, director Andy Muschietti (of 'Mama' fame) and writers Cary Fukunaga (writer/director of 'Sin Nombre' & 'Beasts of No Nation' and director of 'Jane Eyre') and Chase Palmer get right to the point and offer in a nutshell, what the movie is going to be all about.In the town of Derry, a bunch of kids (that comprises of Bill, Richie, Eddie and Stan) who tag themselves the 'Losers Club' are persistently hazed by the school bullies and begin experiencing distinctive hallucinatory nightmares prominently featuring a shape- shifting clown by the name of Pennywise. They're joined unexpectedly by Beverly, their classmate who's labeled a 'slut', and by Mike, whom they happen to aid in fending off the bullies.Director Muschietti succeeds to an extent in overturning the demon- horror-movie template that Hollywood seems to have embraced in recent times. The usual 'fright followed by a short span of peace followed by fright' format is done away with. Muschietti chooses to never let the viewer breathe easy, effectively blinding harrowing scares with humorous dialogue sprinkled heavily with F-bombs. Well, then the question arises for the viewer on whether these kids are worth backing. The answer is both Yes and No. Bill's yearning to find closure for his brother's unnatural death is believable. Ben, a chubby loner who loves looking up history (and has a secret crush on Beverly) is also a neatly written character. Richie, the foul mouthed attention-seeker is half-written but his lines evoke the kind of reaction that they're supposed to. Stan and Eddie too don't really stand out but at least we know the quaint bits - Stan's Jewish and scared of contamination too much, while Eddie is a hypochondriac.Their individual encounters with the demon (that takes up the form of a headless boy, a living painting - an obvious nod to Muschietti's earlier flick 'Mama', and a leper) are dexterously shot, performed well by the respective actors and backed by blood- curdling imagery (mostly using CGI). Fukunaga's insightful writing backs Muschietti's knack for formidable scares in a great way. It is indeed a wonder how the kids of the town manage to keep their heads up and be excited about summer when horrible things like disappearances and delusions are happening around them. The romantic angles between Bill-Beverly and Ben-Beverly are silly, adorable and childish as they're supposed to be. Where they could've improved a bit was on the characterization of the parents. Most of them (whenever shown on screen) seemed to despise their kids' presence, be sexually turned on, or appalled at their antics.Even though the film runs for a 135 minutes, there aren't a lot of instances that make the viewer question the decisions taken by the protagonists or ostensibly feel bored by the proceedings. A lot of the action unfolds at rapid pace, not giving the audience a chance for second thoughts. For lovers of the novel and the mini-series, there should be plenty to cherish. Skaarsgard plays Pennywise to near-perfection and his efforts are reinforced by masterful application of CGI. The climax too, is engineered adequately well to incite viewer interest in a sequel.Verdict: Definitely one of the better horror films of the year!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Starts slow but ends with a bang,"Movie takes place in Bangor ME in 1989. A bunch of outsiders at a local school are menaced by Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard). He's a supernatural being that appears as a clown and sucks the life out of children feeding on their fears. They fight back but are they strong enough to win?The movie starts off too slowly. It focuses on the kids and their miserable home lives. It moves slow, is full of unpleasant characters and has mediocre acting. Then the second hour starts and things kick into high gear. The pace gets quicker, the blood violence and gore kick in (and barely stop) and it really works. However the main issues here are the slow start and the mediocre acting by the kids. Only Sophia Lillis as Beverly Marsh is any good. Also Skarsgard is good as Pennywise but Tim Curry was better in the TV miniseries. So it's good but can't beat the TV version.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

A creepy and well-made Horror,"No doubt about, Mama director Andy Muschietti's newest incarnation of Stephen King's well regarded source material and the 1990 mini-series It, is going to be a huge success.Capturing that currently in-vogue 1980's vibe of nostaglia and the equally popular ragtag kids on adventures plot lines, Muschietti's profientially made and polished production is arguably 2017's best mainstream horror event and a potential new franchise starter.Kicking things off with what's easily one of recent memories best opening sequences, It certainly seems set to be a confronting and horrific experience and while it is in many sequences and aspects (this is a film that earns its mature rating and is very far from being a kid friendly horror), It is also not a hide your head behind a pillow type horror, as it focuses a large portion of its time on setting up the Losers Club as the stories main focus.Led by Jaeden Lieberher's stutturing Bill, who is still grieving the disappearance of his little brother Georgie, the Club is a band of high school misfits who decide that they'll take matters into their own hands and unearth the evil that hides in their small town of Derry, after a spat of children have mysteriously vanished and a nefarious history of past tragedies is unearthed.The group dynamic of the Club doesn't always fly and not every eccentric member of the gang are appealing but a lot of the heart and soul of this group rings true with Jeremy Taylor's kindhearted Ben and Sophia Lillis misunderstood Beverley Marsh particular highlights, while Ben's incredible ability to stick to his task despite various slashings also worthy of note; Wolverine himself would have a hard time slashing Ben down!With the club winning and losing their screen time in equal measure, Muschietti's biggest win is Bill Skarsgard's Pennywise the Clown aka a Coulrophobic's least desired creation.For anyone who still has nightmares about Tim Curry's crazy demon clown, this freshly minted Pennywise will be the stuff of true torment, as while you wouldn't call this It a truly scary or even overly frightening experienece, whenever Skarsgard is on screen the film goes up a notch or two, even if certain scare tactics and scenarios are overused by Muschietti as the film's overlong narrative and especially long in the tooth finale kicks in, that gets saddled with an additonal unneeded evil teenager sideplot that really has no need being here.Final Say –It would've been great to have gotten to see original director Cary Fukunaga's version of this film but crawling out of the sewer at just the right time, there's a lot of hype and noise about It and while Muschietti's film isn't anything truly special, this is one of the more solid bigscreen King adaptation's and a likely series kickstarter, that while not floating to great heights, proves not all remakes are bad ideas.3 1/2 rock wars out of 5",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

'IT' float above an usual horror Script,"IT contains some very effective and well-executed nightmare imagery. While Pennywise (the lead monster) is legitimately terrifying, overall, It is more intense than it is chilling. It's maximalist approach also extends to the movie's pacing. Nearly every scene builds to some kind of climactic jump scare—not just the appearance of Pennywise, but such alternative horrors as leprous zombies, menacing wall portraits come to life, and bathroom sinks that spurt fountains of blood. The extended, effects-heavy final sequence, in which the youths descend to Pennywise's dank underground lair to battle both the clown and their own deepest sources of dread, was a very good and emotionally built scene. Waiting for the Chapter 2.My Rating : 3.5/5",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Wonderful adaptation, impressively scary.","I saw the original one as a kid. That's probably why it made so lasting effect on me. I was uneasy about returning the nightmare from my childhood, but I did and I am not sorry, because this adaptation is one of the best horror movies ever made.Movie greatly illustrates characters of kids being bullied and the way they change under the circumstances they are being exposed to. This is the core of the movie. Pennywise delivers greatly setup nightmare illusions, wonderfully timed and with genuinely frightening execution. These scenes are so great that I feel a shiver down my spine whenever I recall them. Impressively scary.And that all would be sufficient alone, but the depth this movies has contains all the Steven King had in his book, twisted parents and the - sadly so true - decisive way they impact the lives of their children. It is a show here to watch and realize how difficult is to stay mentally healthy with freaks around. Fortunately, the recipe is here - stay with friends, rely on them and you can get over anything, insane parents and murderous clowns alike.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Tim Curry is my only Pennywise,"This was not an awful movie, but it just isn't as good as the 1990 version. I liked the way they updated it to take place in 1989 instead of the 1950's, and the changes they made to the story were rather cool in that there were surprises even though I am familiar with the story, and it showed parts that were left out of the 1990 version. And no disrespect to the guy who played Pennywise here, he was a good creepy clown, but he just didn't bring the magic the way Tim Curry did. I'm still hopeful about the sequel though..

An enjoyable and well made horror film (you read that right),"I went into 'It' with the potential to absolutely love it, or absolutely hate it. The horror genre has been on life-support in my opinion for a long time. So even the mention of expected quality behind a horror film is greeted with skepticism. However the trailers looked promising and an 'R' rating was incredibly pleasing to see. So what was the actual result? Certainly more positives than negatives.The film starts with a scene which sets the tone for the entire film. I had actually seen the majority of this scene in a ""Presented by Stephen King"" prior to another film I had seen in the cinema. The scene cut off before the end though and I have been wondering ever since exactly how it was going to play out. I finally got to find out this morning and I was very pleased. This scene works perfectly to infuse the audience with the notion that 'It' is indeed a genuine threat to each and every character.The things I liked most about the film:* The look of 'Pennywise' - he was genuinely intimidating, mysterious and captivating to watch.* The set designs - rarely do I notice things like this on the first viewing of a film, however on this occasion it was impossible not to. They were impressive.* The cast of children - in particular Finn Wolfhard showed class beyond his years in being the funny guy of the film.* The pacing - while this has a very long run time for a horror movie, it never really feels like it. To say it is non-stop action is probably going a step too far, but it's not far off it. 'Pennywise' was in the film a lot more than I expected which helped with this.The things I didn't like as much:* At times it feels like it is trying a little too hard - for the most part there is a level of subtlety in most scenes, however just on occasion they get a little too in your face with the scare they are trying to give you.* Also (and I'm sure there was a reason for this) I didn't like the fact that there wasn't a single likable adult in the film. In fact every single adult in the film is outwardly unlikable. This wouldn't have been done by mistake, but it is still a very depressing and unrealistic aspect of the film.Altogether though 'It' is a very good horror film. There's definitely the usual substance of a Stephen King film, while still managing to fit in more than enough scares and suspense to keep any type of audience members happy. If you're as disillusioned by the horror genre as I am then make sure you see 'It'. It might just give you an air of hope like it has done for me.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

He plays the role so well with his creepy quirks and terrifying look, I just think he is perfect for this and I'm so excited to see him in more things now that this has sprung his career forwards.

"Not all that terrifying, but packs a surprising emotional punch.","In a word: Impressive.This truly has all the right ingredients to be a great movie. Plus, even as a horror remake (despite leaning on serious horror clichés) it is by far the best made yet. However, with the release of Strange Things, you'd be hard pressed not too see the clear (but lacking), similarities between the two mediums.Furthermore (pretending as if 'Stranger Things' never existed), it owes much to King's other novel/movie adaptation 'Stand by Me' in the 'young kids in the 80's find meaning and maturity in their adventure days' plot line. But lets be clear; even comparing those two greats to this film, should make clear, what class of filmmaking is on display here.The strongest element of the movie is by far the cast, and they are, by all accounts, rock solid. Truly, you want them too live. Gifted child actors seem to be coming out the wood works these days and how great it is; allowing cinema to opt for a fresh, more unique perspective on old material.You could call them all idiots for the things they do, but truly, they are kids. They are daring, stupid, timid people. And (with the exception of how often they ignore injuries that require IMMEDIATE medical attention) what they do, never really ring false. On the contrary, very occasionally, their motives register astoundingly believable. And that is a hard thing to pull off in cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

It: Nostalgia vs. Modernity - A Balanced Battle of Fear,"After recently having watched both of the ""It"" films I am now ready to write my review:First of all, I have to confess that I enjoyed the original ""It"" a little more than the remake. However, if I am to be objective I think the new ""It"" made it out with a tie of 3-3.To begin with, the classic Pennywise was much more attractive to children, with his big red nose, his yellow jump-suit, and his funny-colored hair. The new one was much more scary and I honestly don't think any child would ever go near him in real life (1 point - original). Moreover, the first film's scenario was a lot more innovative compared to the new one. Just as it was supposed to be. It included going back and forth in time, in contrast with the remake which showed an obvious simplicity in its plot (2 points - original).On the other hand, the new It's fame precedes it. So, as expected, it did have some satisfying visual/optical effects, which outperformed the previous ones (1 point - remake). Furthermore, the acting fulfilled my expectations. I wish I could say the same for the old ""It"" (2 points - remake). In this case, however, the gaping difference in budget between the two films has to be noted (3 points - original). Lastly, it has to be considered that the new film came along with some pretty hype-worthy fight scenes such as the one in Beverly's bathroom and, of course, the final fight/act (3 points - remake).So I think it's safe to say that, to the crowd's eyes the new ""It"" slightly outperformed the old one. In my eyes nonetheless, it's a clear tie.Final result: 3-3 (Tie)",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Grey Waters,"Mediocre remake. I am aware that the gross earnings say otherwise, but there is honestly no way around it : the original 1990 movie was much, much better. Let's try to motivate my judgment. 1) In the first movie they at least tried to stick to the interconnected past-future narrative technique that King himself chose for the book. This deserves appreciation. I can only imagine how hard it must have been to adapt the plot. 2) The overall atmosphere was much more dramatic back then, when they did not need to fill dead time with sad jokes. 3) Rhythm, the great unknown. I have been, literally, bored to death for the whole movie. There is no space between scenes, everything happens without interruptions in a continuous stream of low quality ""action"". However, there are some (just a few) bright sides. This time it was successfully underscored how the kids are long time friends, almost accomplices, in spite of how old they really are (it is never mentioned, though being their very young age quite important), without too much emphasis on the ""team spirit"" cliché. Also, Finn Wolfhard (Richie), as already seen in ""Stranger Things"", and Sophia Lillis (Bev) gave amazing performances; I hope to see these two again in the future.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
I now have even more appreciation for the original.,"This is the way that I see it. If you wanna be scared and awed, watch the original. If you wanna see a lot of expensive CGI tricks played for shock value, then this is your film. At times I wasn't sure if I was at a movie or a CGI convention. This movie looked TERRIFYING in the trailer, but I wasn't afraid ONCE! The jump scares didn't even work. There's a difference between a film pushing the envelope, and being just plain over-the- top for the sake of crowd pleasing. This one relies on cheap jump scares and graphically gory/macabre imagery at the expense of great storytelling and character development. The kids are all likable characters and their acting is compelling, but their lines and COUNTLESS sexual jokes are tedious, disgusting and depraved. Plain and simple. They make for a very uncomfortable atmosphere. How many times can you spout off the same old ""yo momma"" and d-ck jokes that are older than time itself? It gets very tedious VERY soon! But enough on that, let me get to Pennywise. Bill Skarsgård gives one heck of a performance in this picture, and it's the only reason, I MEAN THE ONLY REASON why I'm giving this film a 5/10 rating. He's over-the-top and really hams it up on this role; he's clearly having fun. But his job isn't to have fun in this role, it's to be terrifying and to stick with the audience and haunt them after they leave the theater, and for decades to come. Tim Curry's Pennywise scared me before I even saw the miniseries, the cover alone caused me to steer clear of the film for YEARS (and that's saying something because I'm a horror buff). But Skarsgård's colorful performance will not have that haunting effect, I'm afraid. I'm not even trying to be extra critical, he simply wasn't scary. There are few things scarier than Tim Curry's pasty makeup and terrifyingly haunting grin on the cover of the original film. Skarsgård's Pennywise tries to be too over-the-top which is where he fails. Less is ALWAYS more in horror films. Graphic imagery and cheap jump scares CANNOT substitute for the terrors of the mind, which is where the original triumphs. Blood and guts are appealing, but not scary. SUSPENSE is what's scary, which this film has none of. Even the clown's makeup isn't scary, Tim Curry's pasty white makeup, and those eyes, oh those eyes, is absolutely horrific to this day. Because of its simplicity and lack of features, you kinda cast your own fear upon IT. It's all psychological, that's the premise of ""IT."" This thing that plays on your deepest darkest fears.Many people dislike the original because of its pacing. I have news for you, in 1986 Stephen King published a MAMMOTH novel! It took 3 hours just to do it justice and to make room for character development etc.. There's A LOT of plot in ""IT"" the novel and miniseries, yet this film misses all of that. As said before, this film feels like ""The Goonies Vs. An Evil Clown"" or something! Substance is what makes a good film, most people wanna see action, action, action and when there's plot and actual story/character development they label the film as ""clunky"" (Example: Star Wars Episode II). It takes a keen palate to understand King's signature edge, and quite frankly, I have reason to believe that such a task is impossible for today's moviegoers. If it isn't shocking and full of depraved, foul remarks that aren't even remotely funny, they think it's garbage. This film isn't exactly a stinker, but it's a far, far cry from a classic. Rule #1 of remakes: Don't f-ck with the original! I find this film tasteless in nearly every way.P.S. : There are MANY plot holes which I won't get into. Read other reviews for more on that.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very good,"This is the screen version of a Stephen King novel. Usually, the movie versions turn out badly. However, this film is a huge success.The screenplay is different from the novel which tells the story of the children in their first (in 1989) and second confrontation (as adults) with the monster.Instead, the movie ends after the defeat of the monster in 1989. Allowing for a happy ending. The novel's plot complexity is lost. But, the simplification turns the tale into a simple battle between innocence and an ancient evil.The young actors are excellent. Sophia Lillis is enchanting. Credit goes to the director and writers for making the villain creditable and fearsome.Bottom line is that the movie succeeds as a horror film.",,Anonymous,Horror
A instant classic in the making for future generations.,"A beatifully shot film with a fantastic cast that makes a film about a shapeshifting clown seem possible. Bill skarsgard as pennywise draws you into every scene he's in like your one of the kids themselves. The director doesn't fail to disappoint the audience with this instant classic of a remake. The young kid actors portray exactly what it's like to be a kid/teen nowhere days, this was especially shown by stand out performances by finn wolfhard, Sophia lillis and jack dylan grazer in particular.However, this movie doesn't get a 10/10 due to it not being very scary. If your frightened by clowns this movie will get you if not, you will just be in aur by the great performance and shot scenes. 9/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Andy Muschetti delivers one of the best King adaptions in years!!,"In 2013,Andy Muschetti,a Spanish director made his film debut on Mama,a Gothic rare idea for a horror film that to this day,remains one of my favorite horror films of all time. Now,hes made the next Stephen King adaption,It. It follows seven bullied kids who find out all of the children going missing are responsible for a ancient shape shifting evil that takes the form of a clown who eats children. It is one of my favorite movies,Tommy Lee Wallace's,but,I saw it once,I saw it twice,now I'm sick of it,completely. But,this film I could watch over and over again. It is a rare remake that is a film,trust me,you don't haft to worry about with the whole paranormal and jump scare thing,this film is scary anyway because you know something is watching them all and at one point,something absolutely terrifying unexpected happens and your like,wow! This film also has great acting from the kids who some have literally only started acting and Bill! OH MY GOD! Bill Skarsgards performance..HE WAS F*CKING BRILLIANT! He was so much scary then Tim Curry anyway. I'm definitely going to see this again,no doubt! Next Friday! It is an amazing horror film that you probably already saw in theaters! Oh,just one little problem with the movie,if you want to hear,the picture Stan's afraid of,that picture was completely terrifying and everything,but it was the exact same as MAMA!..but still it was scary!!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
The wring generation is reviewing this film,The majority of people giving this review a poor review are those who are fans of the book or original mini-series. This film was made with the direction of appealing to a whole new generation/audience. Most people under the age of 35 have never even seen the original mini-series. They pretty much updated the film for a fan base with a social media attention span and appetite for higher budget films. If you think they made this to improve on your memories of nostalgia from the '90's then you are completely missing the point.,6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Everything I Wanted ""It"" to be and More!","This new adaptation of It intrigued me by the first teaser. I spent the first couple weeks of my summer going to bookstores to find this book. When I did find it, I read the whole thing in a few months(I'm a bit of a slow reader...). After seeing it, I can honestly say that I absolutely loved it! All of the child actors do an amazing job of embodying these characters and Bill Skarsgard does a beautiful job of making Pennywise his own.

It was a good movie. Well worth seeing.,"It was well acted, and had a lot of creepy scenes. THe guy playing the clown (Bill Skarsgard) was creepier than the one in the mini-series (Tim Curry). I enjoyed the comedy and the chemistry between all the leads. However, I read the book as well, and thought that some other scenes from the novel were cut that shouldn't have been. I believe the movie could've been scarier, and maybe the second half will be, since it will involve the kids as adults. I give it and 8 out of 10. By the way, I did enjoy the mini-series as well, but it wasn't as good as this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"not scary, but still worth seeing","And so IT went. After the disastrous summer with all failing flicks IT was going to be the next thing. IT would make up the summer and would become the blockbuster this year needed, so the campaign was up for IT. Everywhere you go you couldn't ignore IT. All jokes aside, I just seen the notorious flick.First of all, with Stranger Things being an instant Netflix hit concerning children as the main lead it was clear that flicks with kids do work. So a remake of 'IT' was in the make. By using children you could go two ways. They are the victims or they are the heroes and in IT, they are a bit victim but mostly hero. Is that a problem, not at all but that means that IT isn't going to be a flick for the hard core horror geeks.Secondly, made as a blockbuster and having kids in IT, you don't have to think twice, no use of red stuff or nudity at all. This means that what could have become a gory flick, because Pennywise is evil, doesn't happen at all, sure, he do bites but the gore is left out of IT. Watch the beginning when an arm is bitten off...and you will get IT what I do mean.Is it all that bad, no, because Pennywise (Bill Skarsgård) really looks evil and scary at some moments and the effects used for Pennywise are above mediocre. To be honest, all effects are top notch. And the kids are believable too.But sadly IT isn't scary at all. What does work is Pennywise talking and looking but he doesn't offer jump moments or goosebumps. The creepiest part for me is the thing going on between Beverly March (Sophia Lillis) and her dad (Stephen Bogaert). That do offers awkward moments and you will get it what is going on between the two. The bathroom scene also with Beverly is creepy.Is IT the flick I was waiting for. I thought it was going to be creepier than what I saw, maybe a bit too long especially the end. Worth seeing but unforgettable, I don't think so.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

'IT' Doesn't Deserve Even One Star,"If I could give this flick less than one star, I would.I grew up watching the Universal horror classics, Hammer films, etc., so I know -- and enjoy -- a good horror flick. This one was just awful. The viewer never gets to learn anything about Pennywise (e.g., the source of his supernatural power) or why he does what he does. The film's only redeeming feature is the fine acting by several of the young cast members, especially Jeremy Ray Taylor and Sophia Lillis.Contrary to what other posters have claimed, this is not the best Stephen King adaptation. In my opinion 'Salem's Lot (1979)' was the best and, interestingly, was done when Americans could see first- class entertainment for free through made-for-TV network movies.I paid over $17 in Manhattan to see this extremely dull, silly flick and if I can prevent someone from wasting his/her time and money my suffering was not in vain.",,Anonymous,Horror
The killer klown,"Director Andy Muschietti takes inspiration from another Stephen King adaptation, Stand by Me. He has also added a touch of The Goonies. Set in a small town back in the summer of 1989 where some of the kids run away from bigger bullies but the real malevolent force in Pennywise the sinister clown.The kids discover that disaster strikes every 27 years where children disappear and it is for them to take a stand and stop the clown.The story is built up slowly, we first see a child playing with a paper boat which goes into the drainage system where he encounters Pennywise and disappears. His brother is traumatised. Most of the early scenes are kids at school, being teenagers, getting bullied. A girl has an abusive father, one child is ill or is he? However the tension soon mounts as Pennywise taunts them, his appearance being increasingly horrific.We see a lot of the movie titles that came out in 1989 such as one of the Freddy Krueger sequels. Another is Batman, Pennywise as a hint of Jack Nicholson's psychotic Joker.It has certainly garnered a younger audience with the approach it has taken. My teenage son is not fond of clowns but he was reeled in because we follow these young teenagers and their adventures and trauma.The film does run for too long, it could had easily knocked 20 minutes off the running time and this affects the pacing of the movie. Some of the CGI looks a bit cheap as well.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Impressive, rewarding re-boot of the epic King tale","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn the small town of Derry, Maine in the 1980s, a series of children have gone missing, including (through creative licence) George, the younger brother of Bill Denbrough. Bill is one of a group of kids who've banded together and called themselves The Losers Club, due to their respective characteristics that make them social outcasts. Whilst they dodge various obstacles, including school bullies and abusive adults, they are drawn into a battle with the perpetrator of the missing children, a demonic clown named Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard), who only they can see through their youthful minds.Well, in recent times it's harder to think of a project that has generated quite as much anticipation as Andy Muschetti's big screen adaptation of Stephen King's 1986 novel, which the near breakdown of the internet on the uploading of the first teaser trailer bears testament to. After years of speculation and lingering in 'development hell', to the point where it almost seemed it would never be made, finally it is here. It will have the biggest impact with big fans of the book, but, perhaps more significantly, of the original 1990 TV movie with Tim Curry (including myself), whose performance as the iconic Pennywise would seem impossible to better.While Skarsgard doesn't better Curry's performance, in his own way he at least equals it, making the role his own and having an undeniable presence and charisma to be a scary Pennywise for a new generation, even if his costume does look like a Smiffy's Alice in Wonderland costume for clowns. Being a younger actor than Curry, he brings a more naïve, childlike persona to the role, and is a lot less frequent on the wisecracks. Comparing the two performances, there's definitely a Jack Nicholson/Heath Ledger thing going on, with Muschetti aiming for something more darker, from the central performance and from the material, displaying far more gruesome and unsettling things from the book that the 90s TV film wouldn't allow, not to mention more extreme swearing from the kids.The shifting of the time period from the 1950s to the 1980s isn't a problem in and of itself, if you overlook the different social attitudes and customs, and one can only surmise Muschetti was trying to appeal to a more modern audience by doing it. Their different personalities made each of the seven losers so unique, and here the individual traits that made them who they are are explored in greater depth, something that extends to the bully Henry Bowers. And, Skarsgard's performance allows Pennywise to blossom into a truly solid character of his own.Unlike the individual flashback to childhood from adulthood segments of the original series, this tells the childhood part of the story all at once, for a flat out 135 minutes, something Muschetti will probabl repeat with part two. On the basis of this, that's something we can all look forward to. ****",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A near-perfect reboot horror! // Instagram: moviesmaniax,"Okay, since I'm now swifting It Comes At Night to my best thriller of the year category, this near-perfect reboot of Stephen King's IT is now THE best horror film this year (so far) and is easily one of the best clown horror films ever made. IT packs plenty of genuine scares as well as jumpy ones, all of which are presented way more frequent than most big studio horror films and making its pacing flow well with constant scares and thrills to keep the audience entertained and spooked throughout the film. The use of practical effects here are also deliciously creepy and gleefully disturbing to look at along with the freaky performance from Bill Skarsgård as Pennywise just even increases the insanity and horrifying level of this re-imagining version of the character without entirely replicating what has already been done (still, this version of Pennywise somehow reminds me of Johnny Depp's Mad Hater on cocaine at some point). Not only does this film have all the horrors to offer but other elements in the film here are also crafted so well like The Losers' Club. The Losers' Club here are perfectly cast, acted, and developed, making us care about their fates and relationships and therefore, be able to hook us to the screen from start to finish with their funny, energetic, and heartbreaking performances. Overall, besides its genuinely frequent scares, applaudingly creepy practical effects, and performances, IT not only proves to be a near-perfect remake but also strongly adapts what already has been done and creates a whole new insanity level of horror on top of that, as well as keeping the same heartbreaking drama core of the original through its exceptional cast into finally becoming this year's best horror film.(A)",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
IT Is Very Likely An Instant Horror Classic,"Horror movies have been having a hard time pleasing a lot of horror fans lately. There just has not been any kind of quality product in quite some time. ""It"" very much changes that. It's been so long since we have had a good horror movie -- With great writing and acting, interesting characters and good direction all in the same film -- that this will likely be an instant horror classic.It's very well done. The clown is creepy, menacing, intimidating and scary as hell. Hats off to a job well done with that character. The kids and characters are all great. The story is well done and it keeps you interested, but there are several holes in it. Spoiler alert -- There is a clown in this movie and some people die. If you didn't know that, you are probably at the wrong movie. I'm going to mention it hereThere are a few things that left you scratching your head -- Like why nobody was asking questions about missing people or how certain characters got away with the very illegal actions. For example, one person kills another and no one explains how they plan to get away with it or why police are not involved. You can't just kill someone, leave them where they are, walk away and act like that was a normal thing that just happened and no one is going to care.My other problem was a hole in the story adaptation. I know from the book and from the 1990 version of IT, that the clown fed off of fear. Fear drives him, and nobody really explains it well like they should. It adds a depth to the story you can't just figure out on your own.But -- If those are the only two things I could find wrong, then I say they got IT right. Well done.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Has both great and poor aspects,"All in all, I enjoyed my time at the cinema watching this film. The excels in characters but unfortunately contains many horror movie tropes.Full disclosure - I haven't read the book, although I will get around to it.The characters, as I said, are handled well, and there are a number of characters. Most films that have these many characters become a complete mess and can often lead to very un-compelling films. The film of course, did have something of a head-start since Stephen King was truly the one that wrote and created these characters, however I have to give it to the film for presenting these characters as well as they did and actually make you care about them.Bill Skarsgard did an incredible job as Pennywise, and was without a doubt my favourite part of the film. However, I think the director should have re watched 'Jaws' before making this film, as Pennywise does get quite a lot of screen time, which can make him less scary at times when the film is trying to be at its most terrifying moments. Despite this, Skarsgard's performance is fantastic.As for the tropes, jumpscares. Lots and lots and lots and lots of jumpscares, in fact I'd say about 90% of the film's scares come from jumpscares alone, and they become quite forgettable. What's funny is that the film's scariest moments are not the jump scares, which shows that the director knows how to frighten the audience, but decided instead to devote many of the scares to a technique that almost literally any common person on the internet can achieve. As well as this, there are a number of times at which these kids suddenly decide to go full idiot and wander off on their own before being predictably attacked by Pennywise. There is also a massively tropey part towards to end of the film, that I won't spoil, but I've seen so, so, so many times before and it made me laugh when it happened. As well as this, this film re-uses the old 'to overcome our fears, we must face it full on' message which although I think is a good message and is absolutely true, has been used in many horror films before.The film's direction is OK at best. I can't say I was impressed by the way the director created scenes, in actuality a lot of the film's scenes follow the same exact structure. The editing was good although the film didn't quite flow seamlessly from scene to scene as it probably should have, it's a lot of a scene ending, skipping time and saying 'oh, and then this is what happened next' which wasn't by any means a big distraction but I think it's worth noting.Overall, I would recommend this film to horror or Stephen King fans, but don't expect 'The Shining', expect something closer to the average modern horror movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Horrible, horrible movie... Don't be suckered in by the inflated rating.","This movie is horrible. And not in the ""It's a good horror movie"" sense either. There is no coherent story to be seen here, no pacing, no exposition. There is literally *no* character development.How am I supposed to care for characters that I never get to know? I didn't care what happened to them. The black kid, the fat kid and the girl just kinda join the group. There is no development of the friendship or any kind of emotional bond. *boom* and they're friends.There is no story. It's one jump scare after another interlaced with a ""story"". I put that in quotes because after the story segments we're often left more confused than before.Now to the ""horror"". This wasn't scary. Not even remotely. There was this one dude in the cinema that jumped at every ""scary"" scene, but he was hardly someone that could be considered a normal person. The effects are mostly done with CGI and are HORRIBLE. They're so bad they border on the point of COMEDIC and yes, I did laugh out loud several times during the movie. Most of the scares are either done with loud music and fast sudden movement to startle you or ""scary"" disfigured corpses that look like wax dolls made in a kindergarten class.That's all it is. Jump scares and awful story. There is nothing scary about this movie. Nothing interesting or noteworthy. The only reason it's got such a high grade on IMDb is because of the fanboys inflating the rating. It'll drop soon enough.DON'T be suckered in. Don't go watch this movie.

Creepy!,"I think this is one of the best horror movies that has been made in a long time. I must admit I haven't read the book so I can't compare but as a movie it works very well. The young actors are brilliant and the writers gave them a script so they actually sound like how kids hanging out with their friends would talk. Plot is well driven and runs very smoothly, doesn't feel like things are happening too fast or slow. There are plenty of creepy moments! Personally though, I feel as if it wasn't scary enough. I think that they overused Pennywise so he lost his scariness as he kept appearing every few moments. Great monster horror movies give you a little bit of the monster each time (think Alien or Jaws). I think they could have used the music a bit more to create suspense. Also I don't think they wrapped up the ending (which I won't spoil) enough, personally.Other than that the film was funny, well produced and had a great cast and I'm sure it will scare audiences!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Finally, Stephen King","After years of disappointing adaptations of almost all of his novels, IT is the movie Stephen King deserves.IT tells the story of a group of kids who join forces against an evil presence that is taking children away in their home town. The story is well built (come on, King wrote it) and the movie is able to capture and develop the main plot points successfully. I read the book a few years ago and watching the movie was definitely a way to go back to Derry and share those moments with the characters again, identify with some of them, simpathyse with others, fear and hate a few others.The 80's atmosphere is well portrayed, the soundtrack is great and I'm sure everyone who grew up on that time will enjoy following along the kids' adventures. If you've watched Stranger Things you'll feel this has a similar atmosphere and that maybe the movie was inspired by it, but it really was the other way around. Stranger Things is reminiscent of Stephen King's universe and you can clearly see it on IT (also on Stand By Me, but IT is way better in my opinion).Now for the scare factor. The book had some REALLY gruesome scenes that the movie mercifully left out, specially the kind involving animal cruelty and child sex. Other than that, the scares and shocking images are there, from the beginning. I think people aren't used to seeing children suffer on screen, and that is something the movie isn't afraid to throw in our faces from the very start.Also, some scenes have genuinely creepy details (pay attention when Ben is in the library for instance) and I literally felt shivers down my spine when revisiting ALL of IT's manifestations. They are really, really well done. The CGI can be a little over the top at times, but nothing too blunt, nor that it does any true harm to the overall movie experience.The cast is wonderful. I mean the kids do a really great job, they look, talk and act natural, unlike (forgive me) the kids on the first installment. And Pennywise, for once, is a freakin scary clown. No offense for Tim Curry's fans, but this clown is WAY scarier than the first, specially the way he moves onto his victims.IT leaves us with a sense of dread and nostalgia, I felt for those kids and the horrors (human and non-human) they had to endure. I literally cannot wait to see the final chapter and see who they will cast for the roles. The whole crew has some serious work on their hands if they want to make the second movie as good as the first and whomever they choose to play the grown-ups on the Losers Club has some seriously big shoes to fill.IT was the best modern horror movie I've seen in years. Go see it. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of Stephen King's best screen adaptations is somewhat soured by tonal missteps.,"From the moment the iconic opening sequence ended, (book readers and fans of the miniseries know exactly what sequence I'm talking about) I felt something was off. This same feeling persisted through most of the film, but I couldn't quite place what was off about IT.During the third act, I finally understood what had been bothering me. Pennywise just wasn't scary.Like many of Stephen King's screen adaptations, IT squanders much of it's potential. Not to say this is a bad film. In fact, this is one of the best King screen adaptions to date. But at the end of the day, IT is a horror film. Horror films are made to be scary. Is this scary. Well...Not really. This brings us back to my original point of Pennywise not being truly frightening. For a character that is supposedly draped in mystery, the film chooses to lift the veil on the iconic clown far too early. Much of the effective scenes are built off the implication of It and not the actual bucktoothed, erratic, borderline humorous clown. Only when we get quick glimpses or partial views of Pennywise does the film really shine in it's horror aspects.Where the film truly succeeds is it's cast of characters that aren't dressed as clowns. Since the film chooses to focus solely on the childhood portion of the original IT novel, we follow a cast of preteen children. This could have gone horribly wrong.Inexperienced director? Child actors? Horror film? IT averts this recipe for disaster with strong performances by it's young leads—with some help from an excellent script. Finn Wolfhard (who you might recognize from Stranger Things) is the obvious standout here as he provides some hilarious comic relief. Jaeden Lieberher is just as impressive in his performance as Bill Denbrough, the film's stuttering protagonist. Surprisingly, there is a fair amount of emotional moments in the film, and most of these moments hinge on Liebrher's performance.The comedy between the kids works, Wolfhard is undeniably funny in nearly every scene he is in. But, the good comes with the bad (as with nearly everything in this film). The constant comic relief actually deflates much of the tension built in the film. After every scare we are immediately hit with jokes or situational humor. The shifts in tone are glaring here, something that definitely took me out of the film.I enjoyed IT. While my expectations weren't met on the horror aspects of the film, I was surprised by the character depth and the performances from the young actors. While IT is ultimately disappointing, it delivers a genuine coming-of-age story with a few good scares.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Surprisingly good,"So as somebody who has never been a fan of horror, and who was dragged along by his 15 year old son...I found this film surprisingly enjoyable. The characters were likable and interesting, the villain seemed interesting as well and right from the start he spoke, which I liked (No big reveal at the end, he was a proper character from the beginning) The acting was terrific, particularly the accurate portrayal of teenage boys banter. There was even a comedy aspect at times, really not expecting that! I guess it was a bit long as my main criticism but I stuck with it because I really wanted to see how it all ended. Really worth a watch through fingers/hunkering behind knees/crushing a partner's hand!!!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
This one just doesn't seem to go beyond the rudimentary horror and tried-n-tested botched up faces.,"There is a thin line between horror and creepy and IT seems to be on the creepier side. With such a powerful character like clown and prop of balloon, they could have made it a class but this one just doesn't seem to go beyond the rudimentary horror and tried-n-tested botched up faces. Powerful acting by the kids is probably the only saving grace of the movie. For someone, who has just witnessed the subtle but powerful horror of Annabelle, IT just stoops down to the greater level than the one shown in the movie (literally).Story (8/10): A peaceful town of Darry, in Maine, is terrorized by Pennywise (called IT by the kids) - a clown that has resulted in tens of children missing. A group of bullied kids come together to fight the clown and close the chapter once for all. They all have experienced IT at one point of time. Bill Denbrough (Jaeden Leiberher) lost his brother to IT and is, perhaps, the most desperate to get to IT than anyone else. As they slowly unfold the mystery behind Pennywise and the tragedies that hit Darry years ago, with the help of research done by Ben Hanscom (Jeremy Ray Taylor), they come face to face with some disturbing facts that gives them an idea of what they may be facing ahead. However, that doesn't deter them fighting IT as they must destroy IT to bring peace to the lives of citizens, protect other children and also, if possible, bring back the kids already gone. The story has a central message on fighting your fears as IT has a tendency to prey on fearful kids and the bullied kids are exactly doing that throughout the movie.Acting (9/10): This is probably one of the most intense movies with significant burden on kids to act it out.However, acting was the department where the movie ended up strongest. With some of the most intense scenes and a good screen time, they had the opportunity as well as the responsibility. Jaeden Lieberher and Sophia Lillis were outstanding, leading the movie pretty much with their amazing chemistry. Jeremy Ray Taylor played a key character of Ben, who is the intelligence of the group. His library scene is something to watch out for. Chosen Jacobs was impressive with his sublime performance. The only lead adult - Bill Skarsgard, playing Pennywise, was good with amazing transitions of facial expressions - he was brilliant.Direction (5/10): This is where, perhaps, the movie suffers a lot. With horror movies bar raised quite high, the director Andy Muschietti, played quite safe when it came to creating horror on the screen. In the era where you can do a lot more with sound effects and special effects, the movie stayed old school - creepy faces and tried-n-tested horror sequences, that ends up making scenes so predictable. Yes, there are 1-2 scenes that gives you goosebumps but that is pretty much it. The opening scene is very well shot, except that it gave away the entire substance (of what exactly Pennywise does with kids). For a compact story, the length of the movie is quite long, thanks to the double- climax which makes the movie a drag.Overall (7/10): One can give it a skip. I haven't read the novel, so there is no reference point for me. However, if the novel was the best seller, the movie surely doesn't do any justice to it. Even for 2 hours, it is a drag.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nice,"Was good. Very good, actually. Probably one of the few people to be unsurprised by that. Very surprised to see the rating on IMDb to head downwards so fast. Shame, really.

Stand by It,"A new kind of terror. It was a great film. Not only as a horror film but also as a coming of age drama of a couple of outsider friends and their bond which is probably the best interpretation since ""Stand by Me"" in that matter. Yes the horror works, it is scary, definitely scarier than the original which is mostly due to the unbelievably charismatic performance of Bill Skarsgard who with his actually sympathich aura makes the character even more worse .. more evil. Excellent performance. I also liked that this adaption was very faithful to the book which remains as one of my all time favorites. The characters were introduced in the necessary detail so you care for them from the beginning to the end and this really makes you look forward to a potential sequel as you are desperate to know their fate (well if you haven't read the book). The direction was excellent and director Andy Muschietti created some scenes that are already iconic. Wonderful atmosphere, soundtrack and surprisingly great cinematography. I liked the kids, especially Sophia Lillis was exceptional and so was Jeremy Ray Taylor. Jaeden Lieberher was also fine in the lead as was Finn Wolfhard and Jack Dylan Grazer. Did not care too much for Wyatt Oleff nor Chosen Jacobs but they were definitely decent enough. I really look forward to see it again. One of the best films of the year so far.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A worthy adaptation of Stephen King's classic novel,"If the recent spate of clown sightings are any indication, scary clowns are back in vogue. It's unsurprising then, and probably largely to blame, that a new adaptation of Stephen King's iconic 1986 horror novel, IT, has arrived. Ever since King introduced the world to his maniacally devious creation, Pennywise the Dancing Clown, party clowns have had it tough maintaining an innocuous image and the new film does little to help their cause.Stepping into the oversized shoes, Bill Skarsgård casts an intimidating figure as Pennywise. With his towering height and creepy grin, and aided by a thick coat of makeup and prosthetics, his Pennywise is effectively creepy and unsettling. Unfortunately the film's over reliance on jump scares and telegraphed gotcha moments means that he, and the film itself, never really rises above that level to become truly terrifying. Despite this, the horror serves a greater purpose than just to scare you and it's the allegorical nature of the story that makes IT a stronger coming of age fable than horror film.King, who is no stranger to great coming of age stories having written the novella behind the 1986 film Stand By Me, adeptly captured youthful woe and the tight bond of adolescent friendship under the guise of a horror in his novel. It's a focus that director Andy Muschietti rightfully doesn't stray from in his adaptation. Featuring a strong young cast, the film takes its time to explore the characters as they deal with their repressed emotions, burgeoning libidinal drives and tempestuous relationships with their parents or parental figures. It's these coming of age elements that elevate IT from just a decent horror film to a great film period. And as the end titles reveal, this is only Part 1, with an imminent return to these characters and their world an exciting prospect.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

An Interesting and Modern Take on a Familiar Story,"""It"" is one of those books that is nearly impossible to translate to visual media. Aside from the number of pages and attention to detail, the book is filled with symbolism and metaphors that will either got lost in translation or come across as ludicrous. I give a lot of credit to the 1990's mini series since it captured the overall essence of the book in what was considered a relatively short running time (still a 3 hr series!). What is interesting about this take on ""It"" is while a very good and entertaining movie, it misses to showcase exactly what make the book so terrifying. Having said that, I still enjoy the movie as to me it is, in my humble opinion a well made horror movie. Furthermore, while I disagree with many of the creative changes, I understand them from a broader appeal to the story in the interest of making profit.The decision to change the childhood timeline from the 50's to the 80's is probably my biggest issue. Yes, from a commercial perspective, it makes sense. We are living in an age where the new hip thing is to throwback to the 80's a la Stranger Things. I appreciate a good 80's nostalgic piece, but it does not work well for this particular story.Contrary to what the director and producer seem to believe, It is not merely a story about a killer clown. Granted, most people remember it as being that and truth be told, Pennywise is the reason we all gravitate towards this story, but what Pennywise and the town of Derry represents is much more sinister. I believe ""It"" ultimately tries to demonstrate the facade of the all american town and how its citizens go out of their way to ignore issues and sweep them under the rug. This is why the 50's setting worked so well with the story. Around this decade the fights for civil rights had begun and racial tensions were reaching their peak. Homosexuality was more than just taboo. We were just recovering from WW2. There are so many factors which add to the actions and behaviors of the characters.Therefore, switching the setting to the 80's, while cool in theory, it completely detracts from the idea of destroying this fake 50's image of perfect all-Americana. In addition, the 80's was a decade represented by sex, drugs and rock and roll. While I'm not condoning those as necessarily bad things, they do represent a shift from the norm of what was considered ""good.""The movie as a whole works well. The entire cast was excellent, which to be honest I had my doubts since the entire child cast in the original was phenomenal. This new cast manages to show some degree of familiarity with their overall dynamics, yet they retain true to creating their own characters. While Tim Curry's performance is difficult to top, Bill Skarsgard deliver a completely different take on Pennywise who comes across as a mentally unstable high school bully.I'm still waiting for a faithful adaptation of the book. Preferably in like a 7-10 episode mini series. Until then, we have two worthy adaptations of the book that do not disappoint.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Watch 'IT',"The year is 1989 and in a small town called Derry in Maine, children are disappearing in mysterious circumstances. A group of 7 friends discover that a shape-shifting monster who disguises itself as a clown is the one responsible for the children's disappearances. Realising that no-one will believe their story, the 7 friends must band together to defeat the clown in order to keep Derry safe again...I watched the mini TV Series that this film was based upon a number of years ago so was intrigued by this film and wanted to see how it compared. In my opinion, this is a slight notch down on the TV series, but is still very good overall.The film has quite a long and rather slow build up, but to its credit it never feels dull or boring. Director Andy Muschietti directs with a degree of skill and competency - a great number of the scenes with Pennywise and the children are creepy and chilling, but this, in part, is down to some wonderful camera work. The cinematography and some of the sets are also top notch and as a whole the film is professionally mounted and well made.The young cast are all on pretty good form and put in reasonable performances; they were all likeable enough with the possible exception of the Ritchie character who could be annoying at times. However, the real star of the show is Bill Skarsgard whose turn as Pennywise the clown was energetic and rather unsettling - the film would be nothing without him and he is every bit as good in this film as Tim Curry was in the original.There are a couple of very slight weaknesses with the film; character development is a tad on the weak side, the dialogue and parts of the script aren't quite up to the same standard as the TV Series and I also didn't feel that the kids had quite the same camaraderie here as they did in the TV Series. I felt a tight bond between the characters in the original and sadly I didn't quite get the same feeling here with the kids in this film.Overall though, this has far more strengths than weaknesses and perhaps the only other thing that may upset some people is the fact that the film has been split into two halves (this seems to be the done thing these days in order for filmmakers to get more money, but I think it's necessary to the story to split the film into part 1 and 2 - anyone who has seen the TV Series will understand why). Like I said in my summary above just watch 'IT.'",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
It just felt to much like Stranger Things,"Im going to be honest you guys I didn't love this one. I went into this with some relative interest in the story. I thought it seemed interesting and the concept was good too. Plus I enjoyed the trailer and the overall way it felt. I knew going in it wasn't going to be a straight horror in fact I wanted it to not be that. I wanted it to be like Stranger Things, but it just never clicked for me.I will start with this the characters here are great. The kids are each very interesting and thought provoking characters in there own right and I really enjoyed that about the movie. I loved watching these kids interact with each other and I thought that was very well done.The entity known as IT was also great too. Bill Skarsgard did a excellent job in his portrayal of this entity. He always had a presence throughout the whole movie and always was scary when he came up. It gave this feeling of intensity throughout that I really loved quite a bit.All the acting was great. I thought everyone gave a exceptional performance in this movie.But despite all of that something just always felt off to me about this movie. There were times when the characters would make certain choices that just felt way to cliché and made no sense. I no that this is a horror movie but at the same time I expected something beyond a simple cliché horror flick. I wanted something a little deeper and this movie just didn't go deep enough. It felt unsatisfying at times and I didn't like that.The movie also feels like it has to hold back cause it trying to be true to the source material too. It like Andy Muschietti had this grand idea but had to pull back cause he needed to be true to the book and the series and so because of that and those factors he couldn't go as far as he wanted too.I wanna say that I do like this movie though. There a lot of cool ideas here and the portrayal of adults in this film was fascinating and I really enjoyed that aspect of the film.But even so the entire last act of this film feels like a strange derailing and was not nearly as interesting as what had built up to all of that. I also felt the ending was terrible too. I really didn't like the way it ended at all.Overall IT was a disappointment for me. A few cool ideas going on but overall not what I really wanted.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
GREAT BILL SKARSGARD!!!,"Where most horror films fail is where they chuck in an extreme change of sound and make something jump onto the screen and rely on that for the whole film, It does include those jump scares but earns them from a good story and compelling acting. The kids in this film all represent certain types of people in society and all feel accurate and realistic. Bill Skarsgard's performance as Pennywise is something special. A lot of the creepy aspects of Pennywise, the laugh, eye movement, smile, voice was all from Skarsgard with no special effects or anything.I must say, when the members of the Losers Club encounter their individual fears, a lot of the creatures look silly and fake, for me personally the only scenes that scared me were the ones featuring Pennywise.This film doesn't give many jump scares compared to other horror films, but does give you a good story and a creepy villain.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A very well done horror film as well as a unique lesson in adaptations.,"As the opening credits appeared across the bottom corners of the screen, displaying many talented names and some that were soon to be judged, a sort of symbol faded in along with them. A symbol formed within the lettering of the name of ""Stephen King"". This symbol for films can transform itself, as the titular shape-shifting being, into an omen or a blessing, all depending on the celluloid that bears it's name. From thrilling classics such as ""The Shining"" and ""Carrie"" to laugh- out-loud blunders such as ""The Langoliers"" and ""Maximum Overdrive"", it's become clear that when given the task of bringing the ""better how he wrote it"" stories of the master Stephen King to life, screenwriters and directors tend to either hit it right out of the park or miss completely and comically. I am pleased to report that thanks to a wide array of talent from a well developed screenplay, delightfully charming performances, and brilliant direction, Stephen King's most iconic horror story has been brought to life in a big way. One of the main issues often had when any film's main cast consists of children is that the heroes never feel entirely vulnerable. Their age tends to limit what the monster can do to them beyond just popping out and giving them a quick fright. This film overcomes this problem by establishing very quickly with it's expertly crafted opening scene that these kids are in some serious danger and, without spoiling too much, are incredibly open to bodily dismemberment as well as psychological damage. The film earns it's R rating as well as the stakes and obstacles that it sets for it's protagonists all in one fantastic scene. But at the end of the day, a story is only as good as it's characters. Without liking and identifying with these kids we don't feel as scared because we aren't really that concerned with seeing them live if we don't like them. Thanks to both the performances of very talented Hollywood youngsters and Andy Muschietti's direction of them, we have some of the most enjoyable horror protagonists in a long time. The standouts for me include the wise-ass trash talker of the group Richie Tozier, played by Finn Wolfhard of ""Stranger Things"" fame, and the equally funny, double fanny pack sporting, hypochondriac Eddie Kaspbrak, portrayed by Jack Dylan Grazer. The group of children, who call themselves the ""Losers Club"", bond throughout the film and feel very genuine in their interactions with one another, making the audience care for them when they face the everyday horrors of life, their deepest fears physically manifested, and a certain dancing clown. Now let's talk about that clown for a moment. Pennywise, as many from the 90s know him, will always be Tim Curry from the Mini- Series. The prospect of taking over such an acclaimed performance can be a daunting one, and for this I have a massive amount of respect for Bill Skarsgard. He brings something completely original to this character. He's funny and does a lot of laughing but there's still something just a little off about him. With one or sometimes both of his eyes looking off in different directions and drool pouring down his mouth like he's been sitting in a buffet line for hours, Pennywise the Dancing Clown is easily the best part of the movie. I won't bother comparing the two portrayals here because they're both completely different, in the same vein as Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger's Joker. It all comes down to opinion and I feel that Bill Skarsgard did a fantastic job here. Where this film truly succeeds is in being a truly unique adaptation. If you've read the book, as I have, you may feel that you know all that the film will throw at you already and not feel so threatened. This film understands the basic DNA of the novel, but doesn't directly adapt it page to screen. It throws new things at you and doesn't hold back from being ambitious in some of it's scares. As for the flaws, I feel they mostly lie within some of the pacing elements and the final act. If you were to come across some truly terrifying and scarring imagery, why wouldn't you tell your friends immediately?! They attempt to use the ""you would have thought I was crazy"" excuse but aside from one scene it doesn't really work here. The final act is well done and has some of the best moments from the kids and Pennywise, but it falls into a very common trap that horror films can't seem to learn from: The longer you show the monster, the less scary it becomes. With the monster in this film, there are endless possibilities of what It could become but they just linger on the clown for so long that, while the performance is still great, the scare factor is very much toned down by the end. Also, with so many kids in the group, I would be lying if I said I got attached to every single one of them. Some definitely got more focus than others. Overall, this is a great film. Not without it's flaws but when the characters are so like-able and the filmmaking displayed so good, how could you not enjoy it? Grab some friends and join the Dancing Clown.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Lots of potential, but...","The characters are wonderful, to start off. The kids are all very likable and the best parts of the movie are the bonding scenes between them. The whole evil clown part, which is kind of the point of the film, is a step down. The first scene with Pennywise is pretty creepy, but Bill Skarsgård's performance (which is excellent in that scene) is wasted for the rest of the film. Nothing else that Pennywise does is scary. It's all jump scares and random other monsters that aren't nearly as scary as Pennywise. 
As a coming-of-age story without the clown, it's great. But as a horror movie, I don't love it.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Doesn't hold up to the book,"I went to an advanced screening after spending the last two weeks pummeling through the book. Contrary to what some reviewers are saying, this is not at all close to the book (but that really isn't my main reason for not being crazy about it).I realize there were some time constraints but this felt like there was basically nothing explained about the main character's backgrounds, relationships, nor their motivations (specifically Henry Bowers as the bully for hating them SO much is just assumed to be ""because he's a bully""?). At times I was confusing Eddie, Richie, and Stan because there was little definable about them besides Stan wearing a yarmulke to identify him as Jewish, and Richie wearing glasses - it felt like these physical attributes were necessary because nothing distinguished their personalities.Pennywise was cast very well and I loved his voice and overall creepiness, but it couldn't make up for the fact that every time he and the main character's met it felt like a ""Tom and Jerry"" routine. They encounter him, he bumbles it or they do something random, and he runs off.Overall I just left feeling like there was so much that could have been expanded (both story and character-wise) given the 135 minute running time. I wasn't a huge fan of the 1990 TV miniseries (probably since it was 20 years after it came out that I first saw it) but it was more accurate and explained the relationships more than this movie. I just feel like I would have liked this more if it was maybe called something else. As it is, this is not a movie version of the book 'It', but a totally different story using the same character's names.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best Stephen King Adaptation in Years!,"IT is the best adaptation of a Stephen King novel in recent memory. While it takes a few liberties with the original novel (the book was set in the 50's and this movie is set in the 80's) it has the same qualities as some of his earlier movies like The Shinning and Stand by Me.The story is told from the point of view of seven kids who are bullied at school. In school the six boys and one girl are referred to as ""The Losers Club"", but they band together over the summer and start to unravel the mystery of a history in their small town of children disappearing over the years. After doing some research at the library (pre-Google) the kids discover that the disappearances happen in the small town in Maine every 27 years.The movie starts out with a little boy being sucked down a sidewalk gutter by a very creepy clown played by Bill Skarsgard. Skarsgard plays the killer clown perfectly. He's not over the top at all, but he goes from 0 to 100 from being a laughing, silly clown to a homicidal killer with out any type of warning. Each child sees the clown but they are also tormented by whatever their imagination conjures up as their deepest fear. IT is one terrifying movie.The relatively unknown cast of kids are great. Imagine a monster who is preying on small, defenseless children. This makes the movie even more of a nightmarish tale. It's rated R for violence, terror and bloody scenes. No small child should see this movie. Even Bill Skarsgard, who plays the killer clown, says the movie gave him nightmares from playing the role.The CGI effects are really amazing. There are some very demented monsters in this movie that come straight from the mind of the master of horror, Stephen King. I expect IT to debut with some huge box office numbers. It is really the best horror film to come out in a long time. On my ""Hollywood Popcorn Scale"" IT rates a JUMBO.Hollywood Hernandez",,Anonymous,Horror
Coming of age mixed with horror!,"I really enjoyed this movie! Don't compare the Pennywise in this movie with the Pennywise performed by Tim Curry in the mini series.

He switch fast from a childlike innocence appearance to a monster with a psychedelic smile and multiple rows of sharp teeth. But it's not pennywise who steels the show. This is more a coming of age movie and the young actors are performing absolutely amazing.

"Good, but not great.","I am a huge fan of the book, and wasn't disappointed by the TV adaption, and walked into the cinema really looking forward to this new 'IT'eration. I walked out feeling a little bit like I did after watching the Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit series of films. The basic storyline was there, as were many of the events that occurred in the novel, but like the Tolkien adaptions there were too many jarring omissions, additions, other assorted departures from the book for my liking. There were also a tremendous number of continuity errors, mostly concerning characters falling into/being doused with various liquids in one scene, then in the next (during which essentially zero time has passed) being completely dry. The acting was very good - all the characters did a good job in their roles, Bill Skarsgård is a worthy successor to Tim Curry, and was a pleasingly revolting Pennywise, the child actors continued the course set by Stranger things, and were neither annoying, or whiney most of the time, as children in films often are. For a 135 minute film it zoomed by, normally I consider this to be a good thing for a film of this length, as it means I have enjoyed the film, and/or the content has been paced correctly. In this instance, however, it felt rushed, very rushed, as mentioned above, a large amount of content has been omitted from the book - the individual characters stories were heavily truncated. I get the feeling that this film was very much released as a stand alone film, and had it failed at the box office, there would be no part 2 (thankfully this has been averted), and am expecting, a year or so after the second film there to be (like LotR) a very much extended version released, because there is so much that could have been added to the film without making the film seem too long.

fairly faithful adaptation with a good mix of elements to please fans,"Intense, well-made adaptation of the Stephen King novel transplanted to the late 1980s about a group of outcast kids in the rural town of Derry, Maine who are united by common encounters with the titular being--a demonic, shape-shifting entity that's preying on local children. Emboldened by one another, they set out to kill the creature despite their initial fears, insecurities, and seemingly insurmountable odds. Even with the source material this isn't a traditional, clear-cut horror film, but more of a character-driven, coming-of-age story about friendship and loss of innocence, with spooky, spine-tingling elements and acerbic, laugh-out loud humor in equal doses. Makes some unfortunate changes from the novel, but some surprisingly effective ones as well that are sure to unsettle ardent fans. Skarsgård is ferocious and creepy as the monstrous, malefic Pennywise, and kudos to the film's youthful, well-chosen cast for embodying characters that are actually three-dimensional. ***",,Anonymous,Horror

One of the Best Stephen King Adaptations,"While the miniseries was far from perfect, it's most fondly remembered for Tim Curry's (Rocky Horror Picture Show, Legend, The Wild Thornberrys) legendary performance as the terrifying children-eater Pennywise the Clown. However, even with the over three hour runtime, certain details or story elements were still changed or entirely left out. One example being that Pennywise was much more cold and demonic in the novel as opposed to Cury's Freddy Krueger-like interpretation.Now, how much a movie is faithful or not to it's source material is of no consequence to me because most of the time..I just want to see a good movie. I don't care how much King hates Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of The Shining for being unfaithful to his original story, it's still a horror masterpiece.Having said that, I think the thing that intrigued me most about this latest adaptation of the novel was the decision to split the story into a two-parter with the first movie strictly focusing on the Loser's club story from when they were kids in the 1980's (as opposed to the 1950's in the novel) and the second one with the Loser's club coming back to Derry, Maine over twenty-seven years later to fight Pennywise again as adults.It's a strange choice from an adaptation standpoint since a key element of the novel and the miniseries was it's constant back-and-forth between the two stories in order to showcase the past's effect on the present. The adult narrative also served as the framing device for the child narrative.But in a way, while it may have sacrificed some of the nuances of the novel, keeping the first movie fixed on the past vastly improves the narrative for me because, personally, it made for a much tighter and more intense story. One of my personal pet peeves are when movies make it clear right from the outset that the characters are going to be alright because it kills any suspense. Heck, the movie itself doesn't even make it clear that there will be a chapter 2 until the very end.Plus, I always found the kid story of the Loser's Club from the miniseries much more interesting than the adult story.If I had to describe this movie, it would probably be a combination of the demonic spook- house thrills of The Conjuring series combined with the setting of Stranger Things and the antics found in 80's nostalgic classics such as The Goonies.Even though the trailers have sold It as a horror film and while it is indeed a solid horror film, this is not the movie's strongest attribute. That is because at it's heart the movie is a touching coming-of-age story with Pennywise serving more as a metaphor for the traumas and personal issues that each of the members of the Loser's club must overcome. I think it's due to this reason that the movie not only ends up being one of the best King adaptations ever, but possibly one of the best movies of the year period.This feat is thanks in no small part to the excellent cast. Bill Skarsgard ended up being a great choice to fill in the clown shoes of Curry. Skarsgard's Pennywise is every bit as creepy as he looks and I love how he gives the character a more creature-like demeanor, almost as if at any anytime the unstable Pennywise is on the verge of going full-on monster mode. The character of Pennywise is also helped by the sheer amount of terrifying hallucinations he imparts on each member of the Loser's club in order to bring out their worst memories or fears.While I will always prefer Curry's portray of the character due to the sheer amount of fun he brought to the role and the fact that he iswell.Tim Curry, Skarsgard interpretation is nothing to sneeze at either.But the true stars of the movie are the Loser's Club. For most of the movie we are strictly focused on their perspective and fortunately the quality of the acting is excellent across the board. There is literally not a single weak performance and the chemistry between the actors captures the magic of those coming-of-age classics such as Stand By Me.When it comes to acting prowess Lieberher and Lillis obviously come out on top but probably my favorite character was Richie Tozier played by Finn Wolfhard of Stranger Things fame due to his endless supply of hilariously inappropriate jokes and one-liners.I also liked how the sociopathic bully character Henry Bower, played by Nicolas Hamilton who funny enough has been in TWO Stephen King movies this year (The Dark Tower and It), is given some much needed depth compared to his miniseries counterpart.While the film does not skimp out on the horror in anyway (some of the novel's darker elements are included where they were absent in the miniseries), the coming-of-age story and the child actors form the very tender human heart that makes this film seem so special compared to other film's in it's genre.I think this is why I am able to forgive a few of the film's flaws such as Chosen Jacob's character Mike Hanlon disappointingly given the shaft when it came to character development and dialogue, a couple of scare scenes suffering from less-than-optimal CGI and Benjamin Wallfisch's overall excellent moody score getting a little over-bearing at times.So if you are one of the hold outs who hasn't seen It or simply looking for a quality King adaptation to wash away the bad taste left by The Dark Tower..then what are you waiting for?!?!?!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"I just can't understand what is so special about this ""horror"" movie","First things first - I haven't read the novel by Stephen King and I didn't like the 1990 TV-Mini series either, so my expectations for IT (2017) were absolutely minimal. I am just a big horror fan and this is my honest viewing.It (2017) is like a small dog - they only bark, but they can't do anything. The movie wants to be scary sooo badly, it tries too hard - loud noises, sudden jumpscares, a shocking opening, scary (and very loud again) music. But all of this falls flat, because there is no atmosphere and no sense of horror or fear in absolutely anything this movie has to offer. For me this is horror for kids done right.But wait - this movie is rated R, so that was not the point. Soo what is it ?Maybe it works as a drama - let's check it out - noope - the kid characters are nothing like the kids from the 80s, the acting is so so, the script is stupid, the drama is non-existent.Maybe it works as a comedy movie - let's check it out - noooope - they tried very hard to do something like that, but again - jokes about periods and moms are not funny anymore, guys.The movie is a huge cliche, I have watched a lot of horror movies and some of them are not that scary, but at least they are engaging, entertaning, but IT (2017) was not.. The jumpscares are the worst I have ever seen and it looks like the director has no idea how to do horror, and I am sure that if James Wan or Ari Aster did this - the movie will be amazing as horror, but then again - it probably will have the mediocre score for horror - max rating of 6. I can't understand why, why this has a score of 7.3, I have no idea. And if this is an axample of how to do horror movies in the future, then horror is back in being the mediocre thing that it was 15 years ago. Maybe The Conjuring, Hereditary, Sinister, (REC) or The Descent are just stupid replicas of how horror should be made and this is the best there is. And don't even get me started on the ""best King adaptation ever"" - Shawshank Redemption, Green Mile and The Mist can go in the trash, right? Right ?..",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the Best,"It was very good thriller movie, instead of horror it was just thriller for me. And it wasn't like usual thriller movies. Storyline was so good they described all children like their fears, their homes. Their gang was too good, for me they were funny. I enjoyed all the time when i was watching it. I just want to end this review with; IT was so good. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
More Funny than Scary. Disappointing.,"I saw this on It's opening weekend and boy oh boy it was packed! But let me tell you this movie is utterly disappointing. Like Jigsaw, I saw it's first trailer and was stoked on seeing it. When I saw It though I realized how disappointing it really was. Throughout the movie they make little jokes side to side, the only thing scary really being the intro. I HOPE IF YOU'VEN'T SEEN THIS YOU Don't GET PREPARED FOR A BAD HORROR FILM!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very Underwhelming,"On paper, Stephen King's 'IT' seems like a solid story to adapt to the screen; in practice I think it's a lot harder than you might think, especially when the 1200 page book is being adapted into only two movies. This and 'Chapter Two' are tremendous letdowns. They're not scary, they're boring, and while I think this is a much better movie than its sequel, it still failed to grip me or really even entertain me.The film is not entirely bad, and there are some elements I liked. If you watch the first scene with Georgie you may well be tricked into thinking the rest of the movie will be good; it's a nice little story in of itself and showcases It (in the form of Pennywise) at its best over both movies. The Losers Club had some cute moments (and were well acted for kids), and some of the little drama between the kids was interesting. There were a few moments of tension, and ironically the most suspenseful moments (not a high bar) were when our characters were threatened by other humans, not by It. It's a fine film, not completely insufferable, but there's not much I can say I like about it.This movie has so many problems: some stem from the book and the reality of trying to adapt 1200 pages to film, others don't. 'IT' is simultaneously too long and too short. Its length is bolstered by redundant scares and scenes, and when it isn't gripping in the first place, it just limps on for two hours before ending in a boring climax. On the other hand, they attempted to cram half the story that took Stephen King an enormous novel to tell into its runtime, and that's an issue. Things happen too fast, leaving no room for mystery or character development - because there is just too much stuff in this story to tell in two movies. It leads to the film being long and boring, and simultaneously hollow and without cohesive narrative; it often descends into a bunch of cheap, bad scares spliced into a compilation. The characters have some cute interactions but are all boring, shells of what they are in the books. The movie tries to spare time for characters, but is largely unsuccessful because of its lighting pace. The Losers Club is formed gradually and naturally in the book; in this film they just sort of instantly come together and act like they've been pals their entire lives. It's like the movie is clutching to this fake feeling of nostalgia (a problem that's prevalent in its sequel too); it reminds of 'Justice League' in the way it wants to tell a dramatic, emotional story that we are meant to find insane, but hasn't put in the effort or time to get us invested in anything or anyone. But even more than its stale characters, bad pacing and plot, and shallow nature, I think the biggest issue with the film is its scariness - more specifically, the lack thereof. The movie is not scary. Not ONCE. It fails to build any sort of atmosphere of suspense or tension or ANYTHING. It fails to disturb or stay with you when you've finished it. And even worse, the cheap scares that it relies on don't even work. It's not even bad but still frightening in a shallow way; while watching I felt NOTHING. Absolutely nothing. It didn't scare me or my girlfriend in the slightest, and it felt like a collection of random unrelated events more than anything. And it never feels like the kids are even in danger; in their encounters with It, Pennywise (or whatever other for it's taking) just sort of stumbles around with its teeth out, drooling but not actually doing anything. This isn't helped by the fact that the kids never struggle to fight It, just beating it up every time. So the film limps sadly to its climax, which is terrible, and honestly the most boring part. There was no buildup and no payoff all movie, and it's very disappointing.Overall the movie is just bad. It's hollow, fails to entertain and isn't scary in the slightest. The book wasn't perfect, but this is a sad excuse for an adaptation. I think it could have been so much better to adapt the book into another series, with one or two seasons - then you might actually be able to unpack the story properly without skipping through everything at the speed of light and failing to achieve anything in the process. It's bad, and I won't watch it again.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
I enjoyed IT (excuse the terrible pun),"Before I sat down to watch this, as a huge King fan disappointed by many adaptations, I decided to leave the book behind and just treat this as any other movie. First of all I have to say I didn't find it scary however I did enjoy it and I was never bored. Although the film was set in a different time to the book, it was a good homage to the eighties. I feel that if you go to watch it with the book or the previous adaptation at the forefront of your mind then you may come away feeling that it was lacking but as a stand alone I thought it was definitely one of the better films this year. Once they settled into it, the kids did a great job and I enjoyed the humour. IT is a long, complex book and, given the running time, I think they did well getting the main stuff across. I'm just looking forward to chapter two!",,Anonymous,Horror
Oversold,"The movie wasn't even scary. Don't get me wrong I liked it but it felt like a really long episode of supernatural. It ruined all the scary moments by making them way too loud so you were distracted from the horror, the clown talked to much so he became a lot less scary, the humor ruined it as well because it relaxed you and you never got a build up of horror. Overall there were about six things they could have tweaked that would have made it pretty scary.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than expected,I wasn't expecting much of this movie as I have to admit I didn't enjoy the original but for me I thought this was much better written it had a nice flow - Bev's character was much better developed this time round too and all round all the kids acting was great - Richie and Eddie brought just a nice amount of humour without it being silly. I felt it captured more emotion than its predecessor and albeit the graphics are better but that's to be expected as CGI has come a long way. I loved Bill as Pennywise too I thought he did a great job - it has the odd silly bit which is why I didn't give it a 10 but overall I think it's a good movie well worth watching,8.0,Anonymous,Horror
This is such an over rated film,"I had watched it in the cinema with a couple of my friends and my sister. As people had raved about it so much, I wanted to know what all the fuss was about. Some scenes were great and had amazing acting. However overall the film was not scary and I wouldn't class it as a horror movie. So with this disappointing outcome of the movie, I decided to watch it again at home with my nephew, keep in mind that this film was rated a 15 and he was 10, he also didn't find it scary. Personally, I think that this film was over rated for a horror movie as I enjoy being scared by them, disappointing me as I had payed lots of money to see it.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A GOOD HORROR FLICK SET IN THE AWESOME 80'S,"It the reboot/remake is a very good film but i think i prefer the 1990 version,yes i have Nostalgia for that old version but it's also much more darker & way scarier than the new film.
Tim Curry nailed his fantastic performance as the terrifying supernatural Clown pennywise & is totally iconic for that role & scaring the hell outta thousands of kids who grew up in the 90's like myself!!!The new pennywise is more over the top,almost silly & funny but not terrifying like Tim Curry's Pennywise.There's alot of cool & fun stuff in the new film & some great scenes but i need to watch it again really as of now i think the 1990 film is probably still better.
Anyway the new flick is made well & has a good creepy atmosphere & a cool bunch of kid actors & there's some great scenes but it does feel like it's made for the stranger things cult phenomena that's taken over & i love Stranger Things but it's made with that in mind.
Some Awesome new stuff here in this version of it & the bunch of kids are Cool & gives that Goonies vibe & being set in the 80's is really Cool.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Entertaining. Not a horror.,"The Good: The child actors are great. The banter is often hilarious. The inter-human relationships are the main scare of this movie. The indifference of Derry citizens to events taking place and the ominous behavior of some of the parents are well presented.The bad: What happened to subtlety? The scenes with IT are way over the top. To me 'not knowing/having to fill in some of the horror yourself' is what makes a horror movie stand out.In the first IT films, you knew the names of the characters. With this production I was still guessing who was who at the end of the movie.Verdict: I was entertained by the movie. Despite IT not being a horror. Bit over the top where it comes to the clown. Missing some depth.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
one of the most well done horror films I've seen in a long while,"""IT"" is a Horror, coming-of-age film directed by Andy Muschietti, and stars Bill Skarsgard, Jaden Lieberher, Wyatt Oleff, Jeremy Ray Taylor, Sophia Lillis, Finn Wolfhard, Jack Dylan Grazer, Chosen Jacobs, Nicholas Hamilton, and Jackson Robert Scott. It's about a group of children living in Derry, Maine who are constantly terrorized by a creature in the form of a clown named Pennywise. in order to end this terror, they decide to confront pennywise in the sewers, whilst dealing with bullies and their own personal demons in the process.I'll start by saying that I've never read a book from Stephen King in my life. since I'm fifteen now, beforehand I've only learned of his stories through the movies adapted from his books. I've learned of the best movies adapted and the worst ones adapted from his stories. seeing as how this is another adaptation of the book of the same name, with the last adaptation was in 1990 in the form of a TV miniseries which is seen now as more of a joke than an actual film to be scared of. does this new version of Stephen King's famous novel fare better than the miniseries? or is it just as much of a joke?I'll be happy to say that this movie exceeds on every expectation I had for this movie and it is even better when you think about it often enough to see it again.however a review is still a review and I must give pros and cons no matter how much I love this film.so what do I like about it?first off: Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise is Friggin Fantastic. this could be his best role to date. every scene works whenever he's on screen and it always pays off. not a single dull moment with this performance as well as this character and you know what- I'm actually scared to see him sitting in the corner of my bedroom before I head off to sleep fully knowing all this is fictional. if a character sticks in your head like that after seeing a movie because of the performance, you know It works.the child actors are especially amazing. watching them, you actually do get the feeling of their friendship within the losers club or the insanity sweeping over the scenes with Henry Bowers. much like Bill Skarsgard, there's never a dull moment with these actors and their performances and everyone in the losers club gets a moment of heroism in saving each other from the dangers they face and every emotion just works.the scares while not scary (and we'll go back to that later) are still frightening and creepy. from the first scene where we meet pennywise, to any scenes with him in it, to any scenes with the bullies, to any scenes taking place in the sewers. it's creepy and it always pays off, while not in the way that you'd think it'll work.The cinematography is beautiful and completely makes you feel uncomfortable in certain scenes, and more intrigued in others.The music from Benjamin Wallfisch also adds to the uneasiness and intrigue of the movie and it works in every level. I still hop onto youtube just to listen to some of the tracks.What don't I like about this movie?well, I guess the only gripe I have with the movie is that While it is creepy and some scares work well enough to traumatize viewers, the film is never like so scary you just can't take it. a lot of the scares are very easy to handle if you're a lot older to see a movie like this like if your above 13 or 14 (cause obviously anyone underneath the age of 10 cannot handle movies like this unless they got the heart of a lion). movie isn't scary-scary but it still works as a tense filled movie and the fears driven within it work to it's advantage.So overall, The movie is AMAZING. I encourage you to go see it. even if your not a fan of horror, you'll walk out of the theater very happy you saw a great horror movie such as this one like I did. if not, well film is subjective cause everyone has a different opinion and I understand if you think differently.go watch it and see what you think but trust me you won't be disappointed you saw IT.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Lives up to the 1990 mini-series,"I liked the 1990 It mini-series. The adult part wasn't good but I always found the child portion to be fascinating so it's great to see another good adaptation of the first half of It.The film follows a group of kids, known as The Losers Club, who try to get rid of a monster that frequently takes form of a clown and feeds off the kids of Derry.Straight off the bat, I thought the acting overall was really good. Whenever I see a child actor in a film, I'm always worried about their performance since it can be over the top or not good at all but thankfully this wasn't the case. All the child performances were really good. Each character felt relatable and so I could connect with them. All the kids played off each other which made their chemistry seem believable. Bill Skarsgard had a lot to live up to since Tim Curry's performance as Pennywise was the best part of the mini-series and I found Skarsgard to be sublime. His take on Pennywise was very scary. Every time he was on screen I could feel a strong sense of threat. It wasn't just the effects that made him scary because his expression alone gave creepy and unsettling vibes.Visually, this film looks great. Andy Muschietti's direction is really good. The movie is shot well and the cinematography portrayed the 80s just like how it would be. The writing was pretty good. We learnt a lot about each character and this made me want to root for them more. I thought the character of Henry Bowers was well realised and it made sense as to why he acts as a bully. I wish the character of Mike was more developed though since we don't see or learn much about him.As for complaints, I didn't like the overuse of jumpscares sprinkled throughout the film's entirety. It took away some of the fear and scare aspects of the film. The sewer scene would have been much more effective and creepy without the use of a jumpscare. It would have felt more terrifying if they scared the audience visually rather than a loud noise which makes you jolt for a few seconds.Aside from that, this is a well made Stephen King adaptation. For me, this is on par or even better than the first half of the mini-series. I look forward to see how Muschietti handles the adult segment of It and his future films.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Put's the SH solidly back in IT!,"If you liked The Goonies, you'll love this.A shockingly poor attempt at producing a horror. Terrifying, it is not. Scary, it is not. I've seen more horror at at child's party. The tea-cup ride at your local fair ground will give you more of a thrill.Talk about the cliché central. A slow, plot holed, far fetched, continuity riddled farce. CGI was cheap and out of place.This is NOT a horror, or even a b-movie horror. This is more akin to a comedy at best. Of course you'll get the odd 'jump factor' thrown in for good measure - even these are predictable and poorly scripted. Sad to say, Scary Movie would deserve an Oscar pitted against this mess.The only saving grace was the make-up department did a great job and the acting wasn't completely off.The hype surrounding this film was very well done - I congratulate the marketing and PR companies spin for a complete piece of trash.Please, please please - do not franchise this.

The FRIGHT-FACTOR wears off,"Pennywise the Dancing Clown has traumatized children (... and adults) across the world in many generations. Pennywise attacks the town of Derry, Maine, every 27 years or so; and now, in 2017, a new 'It' has been made, 27 years from the original mini-series starring Tim Curry. The original mini-series was acclaimed for its first hour-and-a-half episode. Most loved the kids, but hated the ending of the second part. This has shadowed the horror of 'It' for 27 years, and this new remake means to change that.The acting, by all of the actors/actresses, is incredible, with a strong sense of camaraderie between the seven children, but their full potential has not been grasped. With too few scenes of these children and their bonding, you fail to be connected to many of them. These scenes, instead, are filled with Pennywise haunting and tormenting the children. There are many of these scenes, and the clown is seen so often that he begins to lose his fright-factor. You jump at the jump scares, but are not scared much thereafter. The violence and gore is not that bad; there is mainly just blood. The use of blood, in one scene in the bathroom, is far too excessive and overused.But overall, the movie is quite good, with the kids supporting the entire film.",,Anonymous,Horror
This is It,"As a big fan of Stephen King, and in love with the original series, I had high expectations when I saw this movie yesterday. When Pennywise said Hello down from the sewers, I was stuck! I've read that some people thought the movie boring, and not scary enough. But I was just glad that they mostly skipped jump scares, because IT is more then cheap scares. And this remake really captured the true nature of Pennywise the Dancing clown! This movie stayed true to the original and to Stephen King, and made sure that the characters was well played. Also, the actors did a fantastic job! And even if Tim Curry was my first Pennywise, Bill Skarsgård makes a bloody brilliant version. So, if you've not seen the original series, read the book, don't know of how Stephen King works and just want jump scares then this might not be for you. But this movie is really good, and you'll float to if you just give it a chance.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Loved ""It""","""It"" is a surprisingly good horror movie and a great Stephen King adaptation. Everything about the film from the script to the actors and special effects is perfect. What is great about this movie is that it takes time to develop the characters and still save a lot of fright for the movie. There is an equal amount of everything, nothing is saved towards the end and nothing is only in the beginning. The horror happens throughout. Director Andy Muschietti worked with the best child actors I've seen in a long time, and especially with Bill Skarsgàrd who absolutely nailed and embodied the role as Pennywise. This clown is the most frightening clown I have seen.The only thing i did not like very much about the film was the language. I'm glad that there was bad language in it, making the movie and the kids more relatable and funny but this is 1989. Nobody, especially 12 and 13 year olds cursed this much back then. the f word was used sometimes but in the movie its just full. Its like 21st century cursing.I don't think it is wise to walk in this movie and compare it with the 1990s version because this film received its well deserved R rating from an explicit Stephen King novel and the Tim Curry version was aired on television where there was a limit to how much they could show.Congratulations to the director and all of the cast for making such an incredible horror movie and thank you for bringing us the ""It"" movie we always wanted.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A masterpiece on the outside, a mess in the middle","There was so much to like abut this adaptation. An amazing score, beautiful cinematography, an impressive young cast and a very authentic looking Derry. Sadly, the film is let down by two major problems.Firstly, the reworking of the story is just a complete mess. It is totally incoherent and has zero flow. It's just a bizarre patchwork of scarcely related scenes. As someone who is very familiar with the book (and considers it an all-time classic), I was often confused by what was actually happening. For someone completely new to the story, I can't imagine how they would be able to interpret any of this.Secondly, the horror scenes are really quite poor. The movie relies heavily on jump-scares and has no ability to create actual tension. Stephen King is masterful at working suggestive and imagined horror into his writing but this adaptation is lacking any subtlety or guile. It feels like idiot bait, designed to get popcorn-munchers to gasp aloud while not really knowing what's going on.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Well-realized 80's nostalgia and, oh, a few spooks","As much as I doubt in those who claim to be frightened by the original It mini-series with Tim Curry, it is at least a funny (intentionally or not) and distinct horror piece. When I spotted previews for a newer iteration of Stephen King's 1986 doorstopper, my sense was that they opted to remove that aspect of it as well and make it into a more generic fright night with a clown that actually looks like it wants to be thought of as scary, which somehow makes it less so. As you can imagine, the reviews knocked me for a loop.I was dead wrong, by the way. The clown in this film is not nearly as over-the-top as I was expecting, instead being a rarely-seen, unpredictable force of torment, and the film itself will encapsulate you as much in its moments of horror as in its moments of comedy and wholesomeness. Like most films, it has problems, but many of them are atoned for in other areas.Much like in the soon-returning Netflix series Stranger Things, the 80's nostalgia of It is well-realized, complete with the unfortunate kid characters who see things the adults can't (or won't), and the beautifully true-to-life bonds they share in an age of bicycles and slingshots. This simpler time is where we begin, with a young boy going out in the rain to play with a toy boat, which floats into a sewer where Pennywise the clown (Bill Skarsgård) reveals himself. Soon after, the boy is gone.The boy's brother Billy (Jaeden Lieberher, now getting to star in a considerably better call-back to the child-life of the Carpenter era than The Book of Henry), refusing to believe that his sibling is simply dead, eventually teams up with his ""Losers Club"" to find Pennywise. The club is designed for the outcasts of Derry High School, Maine and is traditionally meant for male bully victims and nerds, until the troubled and frequently slut-shamed Beverly (Sophia Lillis) asks to join.The remaining members are the overweight Ben (Jeremy Ray Taylor) who is another new recruit, a germaphobic Jewish boy named Stan (Wyatt Olef), the frequently ill Eddie (Jack Grazer), and the near-sighted Richie (Finn Wolfhard of, what do ya know, Stranger Things). They are also joined by Mike (Chosen Jacobs), an orphan who lives with his grandpa. Pennywise visits each of the kids, crafting visions based on their worst fears and prompting their investigation. On the note of said clown, let us talk about performances.I've never really had a solid opinion on the younger Skarsgård but he does so well in this role that I didn't get the sense that I was watching him to begin with - rather, I was in the presence of Pennywise. And if a more serious and horrifying version of this character must exist, I'm just glad it was this well done and subdued (he appears very little during the film's first hour and even when Skarsgård cranks it up a bit, it is far from ""Leto's Joker"" territory). I dare say, this may be one of the least pointless re-imaginings I've seen in a while.Additionally, the child actors are inordinately gifted, selling the aforementioned relationships as well as the emotions and dialogue. The only truly distracting problem is, as I'm sure you've heard other critics mention, Lieberher's not entirely convincing stutter. Still, they capture that which matters, and the scenes where they form their bonds make a good contrast to the often well-executed moments of horror. We can also see such performers as Javier Botet as a rotting vagrant in one of their Pennywise visions, which is always a fun thing for aficionados of the genre to notice.A big-screen adaptation of It has been in development since 2009, with all sorts of directors ""in talks"". Ultimately, the job went to Andy Muschietti of Mama fame, and the wait seems to have been worth it. Even if it loses some of its effect during later parts, it is still wonderfully old-school without feeling all too tiresome or primitive.The best part about the movie, or rather the best part about its surprising mainstream success, is that it has opened people's eyes to how tired and obnoxious it is when horror films rely on sudden noises and loud pop scares to rile their viewers. It is not innocent when it comes to this, mind you, but its unusual reach (by horror film standards) has seemingly made viewers more aware of the over-reliance. You can be just as effective through atmosphere and psychological torture, guys. Oh and practical gore effects. That's nice too.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Disappointing,"The kids are great actors.The visual effects are obviously impressive at times.However:The film lacks narrative; just jumped from one dramatic scene to another, relentlessly. This meant there was no opportunity to build tension, or to show off any kind of writing.Poor script.The film tries to hang off its CGI Pennywise, over-use of comedic jerky monster-movements and loud stand-alone scenes.Too much talking from Pennywise.Missed opportunities for the whole town and adults to succumb to the pervading sense of evil that I would expect from ITI was more scared talking about a memory of a good horror film on the way home.

A competent little remake,"I suppose my enjoyment on the 2017 remake of Stephen King's classic novel 'It' is based on two things (1) the fact that I'm very familiar with the original film adaptation and (2) I saw it a few weeks after it came out in the cinema, therefore I'd already been exposed to the numerous positive reviews claiming that, in a summer of lackluster Box Office performances, It 'saved' the summer's takings. However, once I left the cinema, I was left a little disappointed. I'm not saying that I hated the film, just that it didn't – quite – live up to expectations.It's about seven youngsters who discover an evil creature has been stalking and killing kids throughout the history of their town and need to survive the summer holidays before it gets them, too (think 'Stand By Me' but with a monster). Films with children as the leads do sometimes tend to struggle, however, I'm pleased to say that all the youngsters rise to the occasion and perform admirably and you'll have no problem believing that this band of self-confessed 'losers' would hang out in real life.Despite all the kids being good at what they do, there are seven of them and a couple seem to get overshadowed and pushed to the back burners. I know the original source material had seven, so they had to kind of keep to that template, but a couple could have quite easily been left out. I think the one girl of the group, Beverly, (played by Sophia Lillis) is the stand out star and probably one to watch for future films.But, no matter how good the kids are, most people are there to see the monster – aka 'Penniewise' the clown. He was made famous by Tim Curry's excellent performance in the original and many wondered how this could be topped. Despite some people objecting to how the clown looks now (yes, he's slightly different, but no less scary), the major difference is how he acts. He isn't as vocal as Tim Curry was. Curry was constantly gabbling his gibberish while stalking the youngsters. This time Penniewise relies more on transformations to intimidate his prey. However, this links nicely into the involvement of the special effects which are used well to convey the dread Penniewise inspires in his victims prior to killing them and feasting on their fear.I guess my major gripes came with the fact that it stuck a little too closely to the original, therefore I kind of knew who lived and who died, therefore taking away any worry I felt when one of the kids was in danger. Plus, as I've already said, it's quite a long film (or it seemed like that to me!). By 'long' I mean that I felt like it should have ended numerous times before it actually did. I kept expecting the screen to fade to black and people start leaving the cinema, only for it to start up again and continue.But, ultimately, it was still a pretty watchable film. I can actually see the point in remaking this classic horror flick. I guess it's probably not really meant for me, as the original Tim Curry version will always be my 'It.' However, I can see new audiences who have never watched the audience really enjoying it (as other reviews suggest).Probably a 7/10 from me, but a 8-9/10 from new audiences as there are some genuine scares which transgress old and new audiences alike.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent adaptation of a King novel!,"I have to say I absolutely loved this movie. Stephen King is an excellent and very detailed writer. Adapting his work is difficult, and as we've seen, has been done very poorly. However, there are some gems and, for me, this adaptation shines the brightest of them all. I know that's a bold statement after seeing great films like The Mist, Carrie, The Shining (3 of my favs), and a large list of other great horror films based on his books. I loved everything about this movie! The directing, the acting, the cinematography, everything done with a good eye for making this movie real. Not real in the sense that it could happen, but real and believable interaction between these kids and every other character in this movie. These children were nothing short of spectacular. Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise was amazing. He didn't try to mimic the great Tim Curry (regardless of some opinions, I thought Curry was also amazing); he really got into the mind of this character truly making it his own. I couldn't imagine anyone except Skarsgard playing ""It"". This movie was creepy, funny, and sad at times, but in all the right places and timed perfectly. I urge you to see this in the theater. This movie went beyond my expectations and I couldn't take my eyes of the screen. I'm actually going to see it again. In my opinion, this was a perfect movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
I think I like retro nostalgic movies but not actually the 80s.,"Between this and Stranger Things, you might actually believe that the worst thing about the 80's was make believe supernatural stuff and not the actual fascist Reaganomics. This film actually mixes the 80's nostalgia with modern horror elements almost perfectly. Plus it doesn't really end on that much of a cliff hanger.It kept making me so mad when the kids kept referring to the storm drain as the sewer and calling it graywater when there would be no well that leads to a sewage line and no sewage line would dump directly into a river. But then at some point I remembered that my assumptions about public works are from today and this film takes play in the Reagan era so it added to the horror that his deregulation may have mixed the two.But the film is too long.Stephen King rarely misses and I wish I had read the book and watched the 1990 version before watching this. Can't wait to watch chapter 2 and go back and consume the other It media.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
No next time.,"I won't labor on the plot, but will just make a few comparisons. The other film was made for TV and was limited it what it could do. This production only concerns the childhood and not the second part as adults. The special effects were improved to make for a far more scary and intense film. Some of the original dialogue appears and I had a few moments of deja vu. I thought the child actors were better. This reboot is superior to the initial in every way.Guide: F-words.

Best King adaptation since Pet Sematary and probably The Shining (which King hated),"It was not what I expected; the trailers promised some fear, but the score announced every fright. Weird part is that it had a wholesomeness to it-it's more about courage and friendship that a scary clown in the sewer. I would pay to see the second chapter, although I won't pay to see the first again (that's what sockshare, vidics and los movies is for).",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best film of the decade,"This is the tale of It, the first big screen adaption of the Stephen King bestseller of the same name; and that opening sequence is so iconic now that it has been swallowed into our collective subconscious like an urban legend.(Contains possible spoilers)This film has had a hard 7-year road to get to our cinemas, and that road has been littered with replaced directors, and actors tasked with playing the title character. It arrives on our screens with the weight of expectation and trepidation on the part of its many many loyal readers who have been waiting with eager baited breath to finally see what they have anticipated ever since first discovering the sublime book, and pinning their hopes on a faithful adaption.So was the wait worth it?First a quick summary of the films plot – For centuries the town of Derry has been home to Pennywise, a monstrous creature who can become your greatest fear to 'season the meat' as it were, and Its favourite prey is children, with their furtive imaginations and powerfully felt emotions. After the opening scene's death of young Georgie, his brother Bill grows obsessed with the idea of ending IT's reign of terror and, together with his band of 'loser' friends, sets about killing IT.Also in this mix is The Bowers Gang, led by unhinged snivelling bully Henry Bowers; and the losers have parent troubles particularly Beverly and her entitled and abusive father, and Eddie with his Munchausen's by Proxy mother. The town itself has a rich history of savagery and sacrifice, which is touched on also.There is a love triangle that is achingly realised, and a deeper story about the fear of growing up and confronting your own monsters, whatever they may be.The novel has a more fluid timeline darting between childhood and adulthood as they battle this eternal beast, but the movie has separated the child storyline from the adult one and so it is 'chapter one' we are discussing here.This sounds like a straightforward monster movie but it is so much more than that, as the mythology itself stretches out far beyond the confines of this film. Having said that, the scares are effective and memorable, and that opening sequence in the rain is brutal and breath-taking, an amazing start to proceedings.Directed with a deft touch by Andy Muschietti (Mama) It is equal parts coming of age nostalgia and creeping evil horror. He knows how to tug at your heartstrings, make you smile but then look around the frame for the next delicious morsel of horror coming your way.The musical score is sometimes expansive and epic, sometimes creeping and haunting – impeccable.The cast is nothing short of astounding, everyone brings their A game and its truly wonderful to see each beloved character cast so perfectly; I'd love to pick a stand out but each one imbues their character with just the right look or nuance. Jaeden Lieberher as Bill is vulnerable and strong and sweet and determined all at once, his love for and loss of Georgie keenly felt and portrayed. Sophia Lillis as Beverley is knowing and generous and guarded, as she is in the book. Jack Dylan Grazer as Eddie is commanding on screen and utterly believable in a part that could have gone awry, he is an explosive new talent and has a big career ahead of him. Finn Wolfhard as Richie has flawless comic timing and brightens every scene he is in whilst still allowing the character to be real – effortlessly perfect.And Pennywise? Bill Skarsgard is a revelation, by turns menacing and petulant and childlike and evil; I wish there had been more of him but I understand that an over saturation of such a character would have unbalanced the movie and so best to be left wanting more.It is not slavishly faithful to the novel, and weirdly, I'm OK with this. I view it more as an appetizer, a companion piece to the novel. Many things are touched on in the film that would then be expanded upon by reading the source material. The majority of changes made did not hurt the things that are most important in this story because ultimately its not about the details or even IT itself.This is a movie about that fraught time between childhood and adulthood when you feel your old self slip away and become someone else entirely, its about the power of imagination and how friendship can be your greatest strength against the things that scare you, its about love and life and growing up.This movie may only scratch the surface of the books depths, but it has the novels heart and spirit, and is everything I could have hoped for. That, for me, is enough",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Overrated?  A bit.  Good?  Maybe.,"I went into 2017's It with decently high expectations. I haven't read the original door-stopping 1000+ page novel that it's based on, but I did watch the incredibly silly TV mini- series. And while I ultimately came out disappointed, the film wasn't without its high points.The film takes place in the fictional town of Derry (in Maine, of course. Can't be a Stephen King story without a mention of Maine) in the late 80's (as opposed to the 50's, which is when the original book and the mini-series takes place), where a mysterious, evil force simply referred to as ""It"", who takes on the form of a clown named Pennywise, appears every thirty years to feast on the fears of children. A group of misfit kids known as The Losers Club then must band together to take down the evil creature, all the while battling the evil forms the monster assumes.First, the positives: the child actors in this film do a fantastic job. They all have chemistry with one another and deliver their lines convincingly. Some of them may be a little one-dimensional, but they're all still really likable. The final battle with It feels triumphant because we've come to like these kids, which is always something a film should do. The forms It takes are bursting with creativity, even if the scenes they're placed in vary in spookiness. Pennywise himself is also pretty great, with Bill Skarsgård being able to almost match Tim Curry's intimidating (but also silly) performance in the original mini series.That said, this movie also has a lot going against it. This is one of the most tonally inconsistent films I've seen in a while, with scenes shifting from ""80's music montage"" to ""spooky predictable scares"" within a matter of seconds, and it doesn't feel like an artistic choice. It feels like the producers wanted to shove in as many scares as possible, whether they fit in the scene or not, and it ultimately results in none of them standing out too much. As cheesy as the original mini-series was, it knew when and when not to attempt to scare the audience; as opposed to the 2017 movie where it feels like it's throwing something at you every five minutes.The bully characters, like in the original mini-series and a lot of other Stephen King stories, are extremely one-dimensional and unnaturally cruel (except for at least two bullies in the movie who may actually have restraint). The movie tries to give the main bully a little bit of explanation for his behavior, and it makes some of his mannerisms make sense, but in the end he's just another Stephen King bully.There are also points where it's kinda hard to tell if the movie's trying to be intentionally or unintentionally funny. Richie's dialogue, while endearing, I didn't find that funny. Meanwhile, in almost every one of It's encounters with the kids, he does something that may or may not have been intentionally funny. Not to spoil anything, but there's a scene in the climax where he lives up to his ""The Dancing Clown"" subtitle and I'm not sure whether it was supposed to be funny, spooky, or both.In the end: 2017's adaptation of Stephen King's It is a mixed bag. Its scares are predictable, occasionally unintentionally funny, and far too plentiful, but the monster designs are creative. The child actors do an excellent job and their characters are super likable, but the side characters suffer from Stephen King stereotypes. The film's climax is incredibly triumphant, but it doesn't save the film as a whole. However, despite the film's numerous flaws, I didn't regret seeing it.Six blood-filled balloons out of ten.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Creepy, Funny, and Perfect","IT is the story of a group of children known as the loser's club that encounter an evil entity that has been feeding on the people of the town of Derry for a long time, so they unite and come together to hopefully kill IT.First of all the loser's club is fantastic. They feel like actual friends and their chemistry was just perfect. One person that stood out to me was Richie. He was really funny and he is kinda the smart ass of the group. I loved Bill too. You can just see why he wants to kill this thing not only for killing other kids, but for killing his brother. In the movie you can see the pain and grief he is experiencing and he is determined to avenge his death.Another thing i loved about this movie was IT/Pennywise (they are the same thing). He is just creepy in his design and he looks a little off, like his eyes are just tilted and not human. Pennywise looked like a true monster with how he sounded, how he moved, and it just felt like his true form was controlling him on the inside. With Pennywise it made the film more thrilling and it made you care for the Loser's club. Bill Skarsgard did an excellent job and i think this will be the new thing that terrifies children.So in the end i loved this movie. Its Intense, its Creepy, its Funny, and it actually has a lot of Heart in it. IT gave me everything i hoped for with a little bit more then i expected. This in my book is my favorite Stephen King Adaptation. A+ or 10/10Along with Get Out this may be the best horror movie this year.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Up Close and Personal with Pennywise,"It is the end of the 1989 school year in the beautiful town of Derry Maine. Summer vacation has begun for Bill and his friends 'the losers', and they're dodging their psychopathic bully classmate Henry and something even darker lurking in the sewers below. IT delivers the jarring contrast of sweet childhood friendship and warm small town summer days with the everyday dangers of molesting parents, bullies and the far worse supernatural terror of Pennywise the Clown. The film is rife with 'jump scares', but the pace is too fast and repetitive. There are too many encounters with the Losers escaping Pennywise. The director gives into the temptation of turning the movie into a 'chase' film. Pennywise is too revealed, stripping away his mystery and terror. The magic and eeriness of a good horror story are mostly missing. The viewer doesn't need to see Pennywise's tonsils, nor in extreme close up. The art of the horror story is lacking and veers instead into action film territory.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Is There A Term Worse Than Suck?,"If there is, this movie is it. No pun. Thirty minutes....that's all I could take! Every single character is obnoxious and unlikeable. It's boring and not scary. I cannot understand how so many people rated this ten-stars.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
How being scared can be so much fun!,"""I'm sorry. WHO invited Molly Ringwald?""Although It is not the comedy that quote would suggest, the film adaptation of Stephen King's story is rich with horror tropes and allegorical clichés; it is also a darn good horror flick. Now it might not scare the bejesus out of you, but it will satisfy your need to see what lies at the bottom of the well, and it's not pretty. Also, it will make you laugh.This hodgepodge of early teens calling themselves The Losers Club, all males except for a cute girl, Beverly (Sophia Lillis, who could pass for Ron Howard 's daughter), are caught up in a 1989 Reagan-era search for a mad clown, Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard), who lives in the sewer and eats children. While that premise is rich enough with jump scares and telegraphing deaths, the more important themes of overcoming fears and working together to defeat evil are well presented if sometimes only through metaphor.For instance, the sequence with sheep being led to slaughter emphasizes the need to break away and express individuality. At the same time, some sheep-like following is necessary as only the group can defeat the evil. We all know what happens when in horror films someone leaves the protection of the fold.Nothing more expressed the angst of early teens than adults who don't listen to their kids or adults who prey on them, and not just a deranged clown because some dads here are downright bad in the way they treat their offspring. It does a great job showing the disturbing challenges of adolescence, not the least of which are their messy pubescent thoughts and pursuits. The film is, therefore, a mess, but a good one, because their lives are a mess of anxieties.Fear is the dominant motif, of clowns who seduce kids into the sewers to dads who stalk their daughters. No 13 year old is exempt, and even the male hero, Bill (Jaeden Lieberher), has a stutter. Yet, if one is willing to overcome evil by banding with others, as the nerdy kids do against over-the-top bullies and rabid clowns, life can be tolerable and offer 27 peaceful years until the clown reappears and eats some more kids.By then our heroes will be adults, eaten buy life itself.

Absolutely Brilliant!,"What can I say, this is a cracker of a film, hugely entertaining and enjoyable. It's not just the best horror film I've seen but the best film I have seen in a long time. The comedy and Horror element is balanced perfectly. Reminds me of the kids banter and humour in stand by me. It can get really scary at times and lots of jumps and thrills and laughs to keep you engaged.Also the running time is perfect, you may think it's long but you do not notice it as it's so enjoyable from start to finish.

"Effective, epic-scaled horror film with kid cast often resembles Goonies in the Temple of Doom","Stephen King's terrifying bestseller from 1986, first adapted for the small screen in 1990, is brought back to life with this crisp, red-balloon-bloody theatrical version, covering just the first part of King's original story and obviously meant to be followed by a sequel (or more, if Warner Bros. has its way). Every 27 years in the town of Derry, both adults and kids mysteriously go missing (mostly kids); in fact, the woodsy community has an extremely high ratio of missing persons versus the national average. A group of young teenagers in 1989, have-nots and misfits who not only have to face their scary elders every day but also must contend with a carload of carousing school bullies, form a ""Loser's Club"" to fight the evil consuming the town. The ""It"" of the title lives down in the bowels of Derry's centuries-old sewer line, feeds on fear and manifests itself as a killer clown named Pennywise (whose harbinger is a lone red balloon). Pennywise's freaky transmutations are startling and scary, and the kids scream and cower quite naturally until they finally agree to battle It to the death. The film, which is overlong, lays on the brutality with a trowel. It is, in fact, quite vicious and ugly in its mean-spiritedness and, though some may argue this is necessary in the function of the plot, I found the physical violence inflicted on the kids so nasty as to be unsettling. The introductions of the characters aren't very promising, but the young actors do have a way of growing on you (particularly Jaeden Lieberher as William and Sophia Lillis as Beverly). These poor youngsters have it tough, with parents or guardians who are off-balanced and classmates who are out for blood. Director Andy Muschietti makes their surroundings so dangerous that one wonders how anyone survives in Derry. Still, Muschietti's presentation, helped by excellent effects, cinematography and music scoring, makes this a slambang chiller for audiences out to experience a good shudder. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

not super scary but very well made,"It's 1988 in the small town of Derry, Maine. Bill Denbrough makes a paper boat for little brother Georgie. Georgie plays with it in the rain and it floats down into the sewers. He encounters Pennywise (Bill Skarsgård) and we're off. Bill faces the loss of Georgie with his friends Richie Tozier, Eddie Kaspbrak, and Stanley Uris. They are bullied along with new kid Ben Hanscom, home-schooled Mike Hanlon, and abused girl Beverly Marsh. There is a series of missing kids and Ben may have uncovered the disturbing cause.I am not a reader but I did watch the mini-series many years ago (not as a kid). It struck me right away that it obviously needed to be split into two movies. The kids' side could be a great horror and I didn't care for the adults' side that much. It's a decade later and they've made the kids' part of the novel. There are two trailers which really caught everybody's eye and peaked my interest.This is like a darker and more brutal Goonies or more likely, a Stand By Me with more gore. It's not a slasher torture porn. It's not super scary but that's not the objective. Honestly, I laughed more than I was scared. It is surprisingly rather funny. It is super well made. Even the cinematography is beautiful. The kids have amazing chemistry. Each one is an individual. They are fun together and natural. Their stories are honest and brutal. This version of Pennywise is creepy and much more a monster than the teasetastic Tim Curry. There are jump scares but the movie does not rely on them. They aren't that big anyways and the one with Beverly is already given away in the trailer. I would put this comfortably on the same level as the two iconic coming-of-age movies previously mentioned.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A fantastic retelling of the story -- Creepy and believable!,"Just saw Stephen King's It (2017) and it was fabulous! 🎈 The music and sound were perfect in setting the mood and building the tension. The story was really good and the characters were believable. The CGI was awesome as well.From the very first note, I found the music pulling me into the story and enhancing the creepiness/scariness factor. Kudos to Benjamin Wallfisch for an excellent score!When I watch a movie, one gauge is how often I say, ""THAT wouldn't happen!"" or ""Why would he do THAT?"" or ""REALLY??""

"It is a very good horror film, but it has some problems.","It is terrifying. It exploits your fears in order to make you It's victim. It wants to kill and eat you. It is not of this world, which is why it is called It. The character of It was created by horror novelist Stephen King in his 1986 book, which became a successful two-part four-hour television mini-series in 1990, and then, 27 years later, the extremely successful feature film ""It"" (R, 2:15). All three incarnations tell the story of a demonic alien entity which basically rode an asteroid down to earth millions of years ago and emerges every 27 years for a year or so to feed on the residents (especially the children) of what has become known as the (fictional) town of Derry, Maine. It can shape-shift, appearing in forms which best exploit the fears of It's intended victims, but It's go-to manifestation is a clown called Pennywise, who looks like a combination of Bozo, Clarabell and Ronald McDonald, but is both child-like and pure evil. The people of Derry seem to forget the disappearances caused by It and simply move on with their lives. During one of It's feeding cycles, a motley crew of socially outcast kids work together to kill It, if possible, or at least to vanquish It from the town. After they're at least partially successful, the kids take an oath to return to the town to fight It again in case It reappears in another 27 years. Of course, It does, and they do. The novel and the miniseries covered both halves of that story, taking place 1957-58 and 1984-85, while the movie sets the first part in 1988-89 and then ends by setting up a sequel taking place 2015-2016.It uses the sewers below Derry to move about the town and snatch up as many kids as possible so, naturally, It's first appearance on screen is from inside a sewer grate. As Pennywise (Bill Skarsgård), It lures a little boy named Georgie (Jackson Robert Scott) close enough to grab him, leaving his older brother, Bill (Jaeden Lieberher) unable to accept the reality of Georgie's disappearance. Several months later, it's the last day of school and we see Bill as the de facto leader of a group of 11-13-year-old social outcasts who start calling themselves the Losers Club. They are tormented by a group of bullies led by the sadistic and unbalanced Henry (Nicholas Hamilton). The Losers each have a defining characteristic which fuels the bullying: Bill stutters, Richie (Finn Wolfhard) is a loudmouth, Eddie (Jack Dylan Grazer) is a hypochondriac, Stan (Wyatt Oleff) is Jewish, Ben (Jeremy Ray Taylor) is fat, Mike (Chosen Jacobs) is black and Bev (Sophia Lillis) is a girl who is rumored to be having sex, which is not true, except possibly with her father (Stephen Bogaert), who we see speak to and touch Bev inappropriately several times. Besides the bullies, It uses each of the Losers Club members' special characteristics against them.As the summer begins, Bill is trying to lead his friends to help him find Georgie, whom Bill wants to believe is simply missing in the city's sewer system, but the guys find much more down there than they bargained for. When the Losers Club is complete (with the addition of Ben, Mike and Bev, thanks to the actions of Henry and company), the group bonds while swimming in the quarry, getting into a rock fight with the bullies and, especially, chasing It. Through their combined knowledge of the town, these kids piece together the reasons that so many kids disappear in Derry and they seem to be the only ones willing and able to do something about It. It must feel threatened, because It begins to haunt each of the kids (appearing as Pennywise and in various other frightening forms) and attempts to kill all of them. Trying to outsmart It, outrun the bullies & outlast their abusive parents makes for quite a summer vacay.""It"" is a very good horror movie, but it has some problems. Most importantly, this is one of the best adaptations of a Stephen King novel and is one of the scariest movies of the year. It's kind of like if Steven Spielberg remade ""E.T."" as a horror film. The script, by Chase Palmer, Cary Fukunaga (the film's original director) and Gary Dauberman features good character development and tells an exciting and complete story, even as it leads into the follow-up film in this pre-planned duology. Director Andy Muschietti (who helmed 2013's ""Mama"") gives us plenty of good scares and disturbing images and gets remarkable ensemble work from his cast of mostly child actors (most of whom had very little experience before this movie), while Bill Skarsgård (with the help of great costumes and makeup) puts the perfect combination of creepy whimsy and dangerous menace into his performance. Unfortunately, we also get bullies who are unrealistically aggressive, kids who use an uncomfortable amount of adult language, universally useless adults who range from impotent to abusive, and plot points which aren't sufficiently developed. ""It"" is imperfect, but it definitely entertains. ""B+""",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Amazing adaptation that had me jumping in my seat!,"I have been awaiting the premier of IT not so patiently ever since I saw they were remaking my favorite Stephen King book and movie. Before I saw this adaptation, I read the reviews from it's opening night. I was surprised at the many 1 reviews I saw. It was as though people absolutely loved it or absolutely hated it. Many said it was essentially a comedy, not a horror movie. I love horror movies and was eagerly awaiting IT, hoping to finally find the movie that could not only startle me with jump scares, but actually scare me. After reading so many negative reviews I was skeptical. So after seeing IT on the Grand Screen at my local theater, I am extremely pleased ( and rather ashamed) to report that IT made me, for the first time in my life, actually yell out in fear! I actually girl screamed (not actually a scream, but close enough) for the first time ever at a horror movie! The humor that was spoken of in reviews I felt was actually appropriate humor for the age of the kids and what they were dealing with. It felt authentic to how kids would talk to each other. There were many jump scares, including the big one that made me shamefully yell, lol. Bill Skarsgard did an amazing job as Pennywise. I was originally disappointed when Will Poulter was unable to continue in the role, and was uncertain of Skarsgard, but man, he blew me away. He is utterly creepy, and you can see how he can lure kids (when he first talks to Georgie), while at the same time he exudes a confident, almost lazy evil its so natural, that appears to be unstoppable. The casting of the kids was well done. And unlike the TV version, they try to use an actual weapon, instead of two earrings and a slingshot, which always seemed completely far-fetched and a total underestimation of Pennywise. Finn Wolfhard is great as Richie, I loved Jack Dylan's take on Eddie, making him a little more brave and witty. Nicholas Hamilton is a great Henry, making you hate him, then make you understand where all his rage comes from.I do wish they had included the werewolf and mummy scenes from the original, but understand it was cut by the studio for budgetary reasons. ?? And we didn't get much of a backstory for Ben Hanscomb.All in all though, I was thrilled with this installment and cannot wait for Chapter Two! Amazing job!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pretty good,"I didn't see this movie in a normal theater, so that might have an effect on my score. I saw It in a Dolby theater and It sounded amazing. With that said, here is my review that no one will see or care about.This movie is the opposite of most movies in the since that the kids were great and the adults acted like a paycheck was gonna be given no matter how bad they were, except for one. Bill Skarsgård.Skarsgård has said he wanted his own Pennywise and didn't want to emanate Tim Curry, while I don't think Skarsgård is Oscar worthy, he does a damn good job as Pennywise.All of the kids are good in their own right, but Jaeden Lieberher as Bill is fantastic. He never broke character, I thought his stutter was very realistic, and of all the kids I think he has the best chance of having a career. But non of this would work if the movie looked and sounded bad.It doesn't, like I saw this movie in a Dolby theater, so that might be why It sounded so damn good and loud, but cinematography is really good.I really am trying my best to not spoil this movie and I am coming off like I can't review a movie, but trust me when I say. If the adults were better, this would be an 8.4 out of 10. So do yourself a favor and go see it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
As scary as I thought,I was not prepared for most of the scares because they weren't in the miniseries. I had no idea about the scene in the library with the fat kid or the bully who went looking for him in the sewer or the house the kids entered.

Wrong tone sinks this,"I saw the original two part made for television movie ""It"" when it was first broadcast in 1990, and I enjoyed it very much. I then subsequently read the original Stephen King novel the movie was based on, and not only did I enjoy it as well, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the television movie stuck to what happened in the novel for the most part. When this 2017 theatrical remake came out, I was a little hesitant to watch it, in part because it was already done very well back in 1990, and this remake announced it was updating the time period. But when the movie came on Netflix, I decided to give it a look, seeing that it would be a free viewing.It did not take me long to realize that this remake was pretty much a failure. To sum up how this remake gets it wrong, I'll just say that it's too ""rock n roll"" to work. The novel and the original 1990 movie were calmer, more subtle, and as a result were much more effective in building and sustaining horror. Also, this remake pretty much guts the original story to do its own thing. Maybe that was so it couldn't be compared to the original movie and make it be judged on its own merits. I can understand that, but what they do instead is hammer onto the audience over and over one ""jump scare"" after another with what seems to be random horror images instead of one true menace. This got old REALLY fast, and I soon didn't care about the characters or what was happening. It's almost plotless.With the original novel still in print, and the original TV movie available on DVD and Blu-ray, there's no reason to seek out this remake. I strongly suspect King himself feels it's one of the lesser adaptations of his written works.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Remake of King's 1990 2-part miniseries on TV.,"I watched this at home on BluRay, my wife skipped. This is an example of a movie that needs to be seen in a theater, or in a home system equipped with surround sound and a powered subwoofer that goes down below 20Hz. The sound track is a big part of the suspense and fright, in certain scenes the whole room shook.Set in Derry, Maine, we eventually find out, from the research by the young teens, that the shape-shifting clown appears and is active every 27 years. When he appears people disappear. This story takes place in 1988 and 1989.All the kids are good but I will only mention two of them. Jaeden Lieberher , who was so good in ""Book of Henry"" is Bill Denbrough. As the movie starts he makes a paper boat for his little brother who subsequently disappears while floating the boat down the street during a heavy rain. There is a clown in the street drain, the boy is convinced to approach him.Bill doesn't accept that his brother is dead, he and several other 13-ish boys, plus one 13-ish girl, start an organized search for the missing persons and ""IT"".The girl is Sophia Lillis as Beverly Marsh, I had not seen her before but came away impressed with her screen presence. Her character interacted in an interesting manner with others, including her emotionally abusive father.This is not my favorite genre but I wanted to see what all the hype was about. It is a well-made movie and I am glad I took the 2 hours to view it.",,Anonymous,Horror

There were a few moments where I jumped but not a lot, I would've given ""it"" a 9 if they actually made it a bit scary. Definitely a good watch. I cant wait for IT part 2 too come out.

It (2017),"I grew up with the 1990 TV miniseries adaptation of this Stephen King novel and really liked it. Admittedly, the second adult portion of the film wasn't as good but as a whole the film resonates with me mostly for its very memorable Pennywise the Dancing Clown, played by a stellar Tim Curry. I caught a late night of showing of the 2017 incarnation of this story, and wow. I'm quite impressed with what I've witnessed. The trailer for this film actually looked really promising, with Bill Skarsgård looking menacing as the clown.The film takes place in the town of Derry during the late 80's. A group of outcast and bullied kids band together to form The Loser's Club. Their social issues are not the only reason they bond; all of them are being terrorized by a monstrous entity that takes the form of a clown. The losers must find a way to overcome this clown that feeds on their deepest fears and feeds on children in the town every 27 years. Most of the cast for this film are fairly new (including the not so well know Bill Skarsgård), apart from an excellent Finn Wolfhard from Stranger Things. However, a giant strength this film has over the original is the chemistry between the cast, and the overall humorous and identifiable nature of the child actors.I had doubts about this when Cary Fukunaga dropped out as director but liked that he stayed on to co-write. I've got to say Andy Muschietti does well to put his name out there with this film. Well done on making this film Rated-R. The violence and terror and adult themes really get to be portrayed well, which really amplifies the horror level. The initial scene with Georgie and Pennywise in the sewer was legitimately horrifying and we can thank the rating for that. The film is a coming of age film but also a real loss of innocence film. The kids in the film face very disturbing adult themes. The bullying is downright traumatic, the sexual abuse and death surrounding these characters isn't even the worst of it with a maniac clown stalking you to death.Skarsgård does very well as Pennywise. I still prefer Tim Curry' Pennywise more but this film has one to closely match. Skarsgård's tall lanky frame and disturbing delivery make the 2017 incarnation of the clown a thrilling, captivating and even more evil update to Curry's. The film does well to blend humor, emotion, and horror together. The kids are funny, there are times they will have you rolling. Finn Wolfhard with his unfiltered potty mouth is a standout. Sophia Lillis delivers a deep and mature performance for a child actor.There are many similarities between the 1990 version and the 2017 remake. I never read King's novel (although I am planning to do so) but the new film keeps mostly faithful to the last, albeit with an update on the horror value. I didn't find this film to be downright scary or anything but its very satisfying because its able to get so much from its cast and writers and makes for a pleasant experience. Although, the film has child actors do not mistake this for a children friendly film. Its completely adult and much more adult than the TV miniseries.Its quite obvious whether you have seen the film yet or not that there will be another film. Come on, you should know that the original miniseries is two parts with an adult portion where the kids grow up and get terrorized once again by Pennywise. If the writers, filmmaker, and clown stay the same, then I am game for the next chapter. Overall, its a great remake that benefits from being more modern and more mature.

Goosebumps most of the time,"The review is late, but I'll still continue with it, The movie was good but it wasn't a clinical masterpiece as what everyone is saying, it just a well directed film, it does justice to horror genre by the way. The scares are prominent in every scene they could have put on, with a bit of humor. I haven't watch the older parts so my review is fresh and clear minded. The most intriguing part of the movie was horror and it doesn't fails in it and it's only the strong point The rope that keeps the movie bonded is good direction and really nice cinematography. On the acting bit Bill Skarsgård did justice to the part of Pennywise the clown. I've head that DC is making a standalone Joker Movie and they should consider him for the part. The story was sort of feeling very predictable during the conclusion of the movie and felt very childish, but I had a difference weather it was a horror movie or kids scare movie. Finn Wolfhard also did a good job but rest of the cast felt a bit like filler. Again talking about the script there was no proper backstory given so that watchers can understand what is happening and they were bit lost in establishing past, future and present. FINAL VERDICT: This movie is a one time watch and not a master-piece and it feels like it can be kept in shelves of school for movie time and can be placed within likes of Baby's day out and other hit Disney movies.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"poor script, cliché jump scares re-writing  of the great story :(","I read this book back in the 80's. Tonight I saw yet another film adaption of the same book. Once again they miss the mark with yet another Stephen King Classic. I'm not going to say it was a terrible flick. Because it wasn't. It had some redeeming qualities. The humor of Richie ""the mouth"" Tozziur was, in fact, the only thing that actually ""Floated"" down here.The biggest drawback was the rewriting of the story to suit the uncultured minds of millennials and others who have never read a Stephen King Book. They took what was one of the most imaginative scary stories of the last 50 years and turned it all into a Hollywood cliché. complete with non-stop Jump Scares that scare no one but teenagers.The casting was world class, but the script falls short and turns great dialog into nothing more than a group of kids insulting each other for 2 hours. And the strongest character in the movie ended up being ""The Denzel in distress"" routine. AGH so typical.... So boring. so cliché, SO Predictable...Then There's the worst part.... Pennywise actually manages to capture the members of the losers club and yet... HE LETS THEM ALL GO... MORE THAN ONCE... WTF???? It's so cliché and brain dead in this aspect that the more I ponder how ridiculous it was, the more I begin disliking this movie. It lived in the sewers, the reason it comes out of the sewers is because it is a hunter. It hunts because it's hungry. It doesn't hunt for the thrill of scaring little children. It hunts because it is hungry and loves the taste of blood. Predators don't capture and release their prey if they are hungry, They kill them and eat them.But what I will never under stand is the role reversal of some of the main characters. WTF? Am I the only person on this earth who has bothered to read these books? My only guess in switching the love interest from Ben and Bev, to Bill and Bev is because America's obsession with hating overweight people could never accept the fact that the ""Fat Kid"" could be the main character and the ""hero"" who gets the girl.Then There's Mike's character... They sure didn't want to give the black guy too much screen time. and then they also switched his character with Ben... WTF? Ben was not the Town History buff... Guess they just want to make Ben the biggest loser by making him the one who stays behind in the town? Is it too much for the millennial mind set of ""Survival of the cutest"" to grasp that people who aren't ""pretty"" are also people of value too?Who knows? But why rewrite the god damned story? There's a reason why Stephen King sold millions of copies of this book:Because he's a great story teller and is considered to be one of the finest of the last 50 years.... so what ego driven Hollywood executive decided the script writers of this adaptation had better vision than the already tried and true hit making story?Out of five stars, I reluctantly give it 3. However, it does not deserve 3 stars. it deserves 2 out of 5. I only rate it three because of the humor of Richie and because the parts that did stick with the story looked great, the casting was great and the Clown was a million freaking times scarier than that stupid Tim Curry that was laughable at best from the 90's adaption.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
It definitely floats,"This review of IT is spoiler free**** (4/5)IT WAS THE year 1986, Benny King's chart topping hit Stand by Me had stepped back into the charts as the film as soon as the film, yet another Stephen King adaptation (adapted from The Body) was released. King had started writing his next novel the seminal 1,136 page novel IT where a small town in Maine has had a spate of child disappearances from a demon called Pennywise the Dancing Clown. Which back in 1990 was adapted into a TV mini series, when the aptly insane British actor Tim Curry played Pennywise in a terrifying, show stopping performance. And after years of waiting King Fanatics are yet again treated to a new adaptation of the novel, from Mama 's director Andy Muschietti. And as the aptly written tagline says it definitely does float.In reference to Stand By Me within the first five minutes after the introduction of the 'loser club' a bunch of kids who constantly get bullied by kids bigger than them, they communicate with banter, they curse and they pick on each other. Perhaps it's a subtle entry to another King adaptation, but it plays a major part to their story, gradually forming a sense of comedy and heart ship between them. There's drama to their story too, the leader of the group Jaeden Lieberher's 13-year-old Bill suffers a loss, his younger brother. His parents have given up. He is insistent on finding his brother he insists that he's missing somewhere. This emotion affects the other members of the group. As they start to explore the town for any evidence, they start to see Bill Skarsgård's Pennywise haunting their inner fears in confident form.Skarsgård is terrifying as Pennywise the Dancing Clown, sporting a clown face, the painted smile which goes above his deep red eyes, dressed in white baggy clothes, a catchy voice and laugh to go with it, essentially he's a friendly figure drawing in an audience at a circus. He can shape shift into the kids' inner fears from a dead child, through a narcissistic father to germs which thanks to the effects team look as real as possible. Like Godzilla or the Dinosaurs in Jurassic Park Pennywise appears in short yet terrifying spouts, which as the film progresses become scarier than the last. And thanks to Skarsgård's heart stopping performance it doesn't get any better than this. The child actors' performances are incredible too; they deal with drama, with fear and with the emotion that comes with it all in spades way beyond their age group.How scary is IT? You're probably asking. This seems to depend on your average horror intake threshold. Seemingly oblivious to any trends or the changes to the genre in recent years - Muschietti, seems to go with the straightforward approach to some of the horror tropes, he opts for the jump scares, the fast whipped camera pans zooming into the terrifying faces and finally the Psycho-esque strings banging and striking harshly at elements of the film. Muschietti's approach is slow; he slowly adds these jump scares each more effective than the last striking the kids' fears one take at a time. This all adds up to the film's final approach in the third act, when Pennywise shows himself for the monster he really is. The group has one final fight to get rid of the threat once and for all.And it all pays off in the end as this is perhaps the best horror film in recent years, it's terrifying, it's spooky and it's darkly entertaining as the new Pennywise may just be the best horror demon EVERVERDICT A potent, bold, and terrifying horror story which solidly manages to deal with the collection of scary, hallucinatory, ludicrous, nightmarish images from King's novel. And may just be the best King adaptation in recent years.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

From now on my favorite Horror Movie,"First of all to all those who rate such a movie with 1 star. That is absolutely a mystery to me, how such a movie can be rated that bad. There are a lot of B and C movies out there that really deserve a rating like that, but in times where something like a IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes rating has serious economic impact for filmmakers, producers, actors, future film projects, etc., it is a careless act to rate in such a way.Nobody has to like a movie, but everybody should rate with a common sense to keep portals like IMDb valuable.To the movie itself: I won't give you the 100.000 rating like a semi-pro critic. I will give you, who maybe hasn't seen the movie already, a short view of someone who really likes Horror movies and is bored the last years about the again and again and again produced ghost stories that just stopped thrilling me.IT is a movie I know from my childhood. It shocked me in the nineties and led to hating clowns until now. I was really pleased to hear, there will be a remake. But also I was afraid about the result, cause many remakes are just a bad copy of the original. Yesterday I saw the movie at the German Fantasy Filmfest in original English and man... I was deeply impressed afterwards!The movie kept my pulse high from the 1st minute till the last one. The beginning scene with Georgie is just brilliant. The cast is absolutely fabulous. The technical set of the movie is perfect in my eyes. CG is so good, that the director had the chance to put the shocking moments not only in the night, where light is pale, but also in the daylight. And the horror was there also at light! That is really not often to be seen in movies. Most of the time, horror plays with darkness, light keeps the audience in safe. But not in this movie. That was one of the facts that made the movie win my heart.Skargard as the clown was really a winning for this role. I never thought he would act worse than Tim Curry. In combination with technical chances you have many years after the original movie, it was just a lot of fun to watch. Very important: watch this movie in Dolby Atmos. The sound some people here describe as too loud, was in Atmos the perfect supporter of every horror scene. Not everybody loves jump scares, and the movie has a lot of jump scares, but for me it was the perfect way to realize this book as a movie and keep the horror at a high level. You can hardly realize the book with all detailed descriptions King made. It is leaned on the story and the creator did a great job in that.For all people who love the book and read it thousand times: Just keep the book as a story and the movie as a leaned on picture. Like Lord of the rings, a director can never create your personal imagination for 100%. He has to deliver entertainment for everybody out there. I like red. You maybe like blue. It isn't that simple...",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't waste your money,"I was really hoping they wouldn't mess this one up. There's soooo many things wrong with it. I could write a thesis on it. I will start by naming some of my favorite horror movies. The exorcist, Demon Knight, the Descent 1 and 2, the first Conjuring, Sinister, and some of the Saw movies. If you liked any of those you can trust me on this one.First off, we all knew no one was going to do a better job at playing the character of ""IT"" then Tim Curry. His voice alone made the clown creepy as hell. I went to see the remake and as soon as the clown opened his mouth I put my head in my hands and was like are you serious. This actor actually tried to sound like Tim Curry instead of making ""IT"" his own. He came across sounding like he had a mental disability. At this point in the movie, which was pretty much the beginning, I knew it was going to be bad! It's like when they made a nightmare on elm st. without using Robert Englund. That guy is Freddy Krueger ! When you think of Freddy you see his face and hear his voice.Maybe I'm completely desensitized but it was not scary at all. There was way too much CGI which I hate. I think it's better to not use it so much which is what made the first one so great. If you watch something like Demon Knight or the Descent and then watch this you'll see the difference.There was one part where the clown says beep beep Richie. Now in the original there was a reason for it. Richie's friends would say that when they wanted him to stop joking around. In the remake his friends never say that to him so it doesn't make sense for the clown to say it at all. I really think they should have made a sequel as opposed to a remake. Don't remake something if you can't make it better than the originalLong story short, it was thrown together and they could have done a way better job. I have no idea why it's getting such high ratings.. I think the reason I don't like it is because I've seen the original way too many times and went in there with high expectation : ( Now a friend of mine offered to take me to see it again for FREE because they didn't see it. I said absolutely not. I'm not wasting another 2 hours of my life.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Go Ahead & Hate, But I Don't Like This One Or The Original","It defies me this movie is at present an 8.0 (as in the rare territory of a classic like ""Gone With The Wind""). True, I haven't read the book, but this isn't a book review and therefore no matter how excellent the book is it's simply not relevant.What I have seen is the remake of the movie as well as the original. I'm wondering, first why remake this movie as it is pretty lame the first time, at least on-screen (just because the first screen version was lame doesn't mean two lame versions should exist)? Of course we know many paying viewers like it. plus an there's always someone else who wants to re-live something they liked again. Maybe King simply has a Faustian bargain?So,""IT"" get's remade. The new version is some better than the original movie even if it is surprisingly hardly different. The fans know who they are of courseand they will eat this up. I don't care one way or the other so I just call it like it appears to me. I don't think it is particularly scary, a good story, or even a compelling improvement over the lame original.I am not a fan of this King movie. I don't like the story or the execution of it not once, but twice. I like Sci-Fi- and the paranormal but I am not particularly on-board with anything regarding IT. I'm left with one thought: the book must have been so good you can have not one but two movies based on it 27 years apart. That speaks well for Stephen King as most writers never get one story made into a movie let alone many stories made into many movies and now, it would seem, the same stories are being made into new movies all over again. Though I don't care for either IT movie I certainly am in deep respect of how King connects with an audience even when his tomes are devoid of palpable scares. This stuff is pure pablum and it quite silly to the point of boredom.",,Anonymous,Horror
Not as Good as the Original,"I am a gigantic fan of the original ""It"" miniseries, and this latest version pales in comparison. First and foremost there is a complete over abundance of CGI. This made the film so much less scary than the practical effects of the original because so many things just looked fake. Secondly the clown is overshadowed by the brilliance of Tim Curry in the original. The appeal of his Pennywise was that he wasn't overly creepy looking. You could see his clown showing up at a birthday party and not be too hesitant to get a balloon from him. 2017 Pennywise is just your typical creepy clown. No child I know would want to want to go near him. I also found it odd that this version took place in the late 80's. I understand why they did that but it just didn't ring true to the book. I also appreciated the kids in the original more. They were more fleshed out and likable. All these critiques being said, I will say that the film kept me entertained the whole time. The kids were pretty endearing and funny. Ritchie was particularly entertaining. There were some scary parts that weren't done by computer, and there's a nice little homage to Tim Curry's Pennywise in the film. It's worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not Bad. Not Bad at All,"Unpopular opinion that will likely result in you guys sicking your dogs on me: I don't like the original It mini-series. I honestly don't. Do I hate it? No. I think the child actors did an okay job for what they're given and there are a couple decent scares here and there, but maybe it's just me, but I found it damn near impossible to take seriously. Most of the scares just bordered on unintentional comedy for me (I still find myself cracking up at the ""Kiss me, Fatboy"" line) and here's another unpopular opinion that will likely result in me getting killed or maimed: I didn't like Tim Curry's Pennywise. Don't get me wrong, I like Tim Curry, but he came off as more funny than he did scary or intimidating which probably isn't a good sign if you're doing a balls-to-the- wall horror film. Maybe the film was terrifying at the time it came out, but nowadays it's just really corny and dated. I don't think it holds up nearly as well as people say it does. But enough bashing of the original. How does the new film hold up?Honestly, I think it's a marked improvement. That's not to say it doesn't have its flaws because it does. Its biggest issue is that it can be over-reliant on jump scares at times and I can't help but feel that was because the studio felt the need to try to appeal to basic movie-goers who consider a horror film sucky if it doesn't make them jump out of their seat at least once or twice. But to be fair, most of the jump scares are at least being used to utilize something we as the audience are supposed to be afraid of and they do manage to stir in a few clever and ballsy scares in there too. Hell, there's one scare in the first five minutes of the film that I'm surprised they even attempted. I won't spoil it for you, but it's pretty shocking to say the least. So I guess you can say, it appeals to both audiences in a way. It definitely feels a lot more like a horror film than the original did.Most of the performances were pretty good for the most part. Most the child actors did a pretty good job, the two best probably being Bev and the kid from Stranger Things. The only performance that didn't really work was the kid playing Stan. His performance was pretty iffy and I didn't really buy it at all. But good child acting is a rarity, so it is a pretty impressive feat that only one of the actors isn't very good as opposed to all of them. The kids themselves had pretty good chemistry as well and I had no problem believing the legitimacy of their friendship. But the scene stealer by far is Bill Skaarsgaard as Pennywise. Sure, he could be funny at times, but not once did I ever forget that he was also supposed to be scary and a legitimate threat. He managed to find a good balance unlike Tim Curry whose performance was so over-the-top, that I forgot that he was even supposed to be threatening.Some of the side characters were a little underdeveloped, but they at least had a lot more character in this film than they did in the mini-series. Henry Bowers was a little more than just a generic bully and Mike was more than just the token black kid who shows up randomly near the end of Part 1. They could be developed a lot more, sure, but there's at least SOME character there.So all in all, while I don't think it's anywhere close to being one of the best Stephen King movies, it's still an enjoyable film. It's creepy, it's funny, it's energetic, and it's effective. I see myself watching this version again a lot more than I do the Tim Curry version. From what I understand, they're making a second film about the adulthood portion. While even fans of the book and mini-series seem to agree that the adulthood portions aren't that great, I am curious to see how these filmmakers pull it off. They surprised me with this film, didn't they? So you bet, I'll be back for the sequel.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Great performances, heartfelt narrative","The lead-up to this film was so full of anticipation and excitement, and as a massive Stephen King fan myself I was looking forward to seeing how the film adaptation would compare to the infamous 1986 horror novel. Following IT's release, the most popular question on everyone's lips was, ""Is Pennywise the Dancing Clown scary?"".In short, yes. Bill Skarsgard does an exceptional job in portraying the demonic and downright evil clown who feeds on children and their fears. The makeup and CGI combined is highly efficient and well edited, and not at all overdone or obvious to the viewer, making him both intriguing and utterly terrifying simultaneously. Director Andy Muschietti has done an excellent job of creating tense and beautifully shot moments. During the duration of the run time, I found myself consistently resisting the urge to cover my eyes and ears for fear of being caught off guard.However, by a long stretch the highlight of the film, for me at least, is the kids. Each character is unique and intriguing and brings something to the group. Because these children are mostly left to fight for themselves given that the adults around them are completely oblivious to the evil lurking in the sewers, it gives the film an underdog feel and as a viewer you feel connected to the characters. This movie is also inherently funny, and I found myself laughing out loud at the numerous wisecracks and one-liners from the get-go. It's always tough to harshly judge young child actors on their abilities, and luckily I won't need to here due to high quality, raw performances from every young actor in this movie. Particular standout performances are from lead Jaeden Lieberher (The Book of Henry) and Finn Wolfhard (Stranger Things), whose comedic timing is second to none. Watching this also brought me a sense of nostalgia for my childhood, and the feeling you get when great friends surround you on a big adventure.As a fan of the novel, I was not disappointed and can agree with critics in saying that this film both pays tribute to the book and cleverly omits unnecessary portions of the narrative to make for better viewing. I highly recommend checking this movie out if you haven't already and am looking forward to seeing what the director does next (IT - Chapter Two?).",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
IT's an Entertaining If Flawed Project,"Well the cinematic adaptation of Stephen King's It was interesting to say the least, to describe it as a film of horror skits wouldn't be unfair and that is meant to be both a compliment to those successful film moments but also a word of warning that the film succeeds or fails by the effectiveness of them and I tend to go with the former.I perceive the best way to view this film and get the most out of it is to not go in expecting a horror film masterclass and instead go into this film in a more entertain in the moment kind of cinematic experience.My criticisms of the film include the fact that you could easily pinpoint a couple of pointless scenes where you could knock at least ten minutes off to make the film leaner, also given the films author unfortunately those King-isms as I refer to them do occasionally make their presence very much felt in film form, also I get it film, you're set in the eighties you don't have to endlessly tell me in every scene of the film with a poster here a song there and so on, Stranger Things may want a word with you for this reason which to an extent is ironic given that Stranger Things in essence is a heavily influenced Stephen King project.Significant film positives include the performance of the young cast where a lot of the films goodwill can be attributed and also in Bill Skarsgards performance as Pennywise that well...will not improve anybody's already delicate fear of clowns, at its best it's a wonderfully detailed and stylized horror segment piece that does what the best horror films do, make you feel the characters fear, we can all have our own personal things that give us the chills but the best of horror films go beyond this to make you fear something through someone else.It's an example of skilfully made horror segments/skits tied clunkily together with a main narrative deemed necessary to propel the film forward, is it an brilliant horror film? No it's not but it's a pretty damn entertaining one.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

A real horror movie,"I was never very impressed with the 1990 version of IT. While Tim Curry's Pennywise was creepy in his own way, he was never true nightmare material. This version is much scarier and more violent - a true horror movie. I jumped several times and had to turn away from the screen in a couple of places, and I am not easily scared (or so I tell myself). There were several bits of comic relief scattered in, even in the middle of really tense parts of the movie, so that your adrenaline wasn't engaged the ENTIRE time. The acting was phenomenal and believable for the most part, although a little over the top in a couple places with a couple of the kids, which is the only reason I didn't give the movie a 10. Otherwise, if you want to get the pants scared off of you, go see this movie!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Why I'm not giving it a 10 out of 10,"Firstly, let me say, I am a huge Stephen King fan and a constant reader since I was 11 or 12 years old. IT was one of the very first books I read and one of the first horror movies I watched. I actually watched the original before going to the cinema to see the new one and I was not disappointed to see that they had kept very much to the original story and even surprised me when they stayed in the original era rather than modernising it. However, call me nostalgic, but it was just not the same without Tim Curry and that's why I can't give it 10/10. Silly to some, maybe but I'm sure there's other 'elders' like me who felt the same. Other than that, the kids acting was 10/10, storyline 10/10, dialogue 10/10, clown acting 8/10, it was just a bit too much at times but overall it has left me anxiously anticipating the final chapter.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good scare (and some laughs), but not great","The actor of It is fantastic--genuinely disturbing and creepy. The acting was very convincing, with some very amazing shots and scenes. The kids also were great. They provided appropriate comedic breaks in the terror, and their relationships seemed genuine and were interesting. The story was a pretty typical horror movie story, with some nice twists/differences, especially a strong minded main character. However, the movie just doesn't seem to consistently piece together these individual assets into a nice flow. The beginning of the movie gives you a barrage of haunting scenes that is too fast or too much too quick to be meaningful. I even found myself yawning in some of these scenes that were meant to be terrifying because of that! Similarly, some scenes are just too much--either way too ""cartoon like"", or its just trying too hard. Also, the movie sometimes, especially in the first half, felt too choppy, and it felt like there was hardly any flow, really ruining the story telling. I was going in thinking I was going to get something similar to Stranger Things (TV), but instead at times it was like a poor haphazard description by a friend who had too much caffeine. I hope the next movie will correct this and take its time more with meaningful scenes instead of trying to fit in a lot of unnecessary ""scary scenes"".",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Mediocrity all over the place,"I don't have very specific complaints from the movie other than that it was just...mediocre. And all over the place. It failed to set any ""tone"" to the movie. Is it supposed to be scary? Or funny? Or a mix of both? The character development was sort of really poor. Especially when it comes to the sexual abuse victim.Comic relief was used a bit too much for a movie that's supposed to show the darker tones of life. The fear and apprehension that should have been sketched as it's supposed to be when your brother is killed off by a paranormal evil entity was watered down by the all over the place spectrum of emotions.And by God the length of the movie was way overstretched for the content that they had to offer.Just...mediocre B grade movie. The rating its getting kind of insults the hard work and brilliance that a lot of movies had to showcase to get the rating this movie is getting for no reason.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great to see an R-rated horror movie become such a huge blockbuster!,"'IT': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The first installment in a planned duology, based on Stephen King's popular 1986 book (of the same name); which was previously adapted into a two part TV movie miniseries in 1990 ('IT' was divided in to two chapters in the same way). This installment deals with seven children that have to fight an ancient evil being (in 1980s Derry, Maine); the sequel will deal with the children 30-years later, having to fight the same entity as adults. The movie stars Jaeden Lieberher, Bill Skarsgard, Jeremy Ray Taylor, Sophia Lillis, Finn Wolfhard (of 'STRANGER THINGS' fame), Wyatt Oleff, Chosen Jacobs, Jack Dylan Grazer and Nicholas Hamilton. 'IT' was directed by Andy Muschietti (who also helmed the hit 2013 horror flick 'MAMA'), and 'IT' was written by Chase Palmer, Cary Fukunaga, and Gary Dauberman. 'IT' has received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics, and 'IT' is a huge hit at the Box Office as well. I absolutely loved 'IT' too.The story (in this updated version) is set in 1989 Derry, Maine. Several children have gone missing, including Bill Denbrough's (Lieberher) 7-year-old brother George (Jackson Robert Scott). Bill and his other preteen friends, a group that calls themselves 'The Losers Club', investigate the disappearances of George and all the other kids. They find that an evil entity, known as Pennywise The Dancing Clown (Skarsgard), is responsible for all the disappearances. In order to fight the monster, they must each confront their own worst fears.I read the book and saw the original TV miniseries, when I was a kid, and I was a big fan of both. I think this theatrical adaptation is about as good as you could expect from 'IT'. 'IT' has a great 80s style 'kids on an adventure together' feel to 'IT'. 'IT' seems effectively scary, and it's also a good 'monster flick' action movie. Pennywise is a classic villain, and I'd say this version is about as good as the 1990 one (played by Tim Curry). The film is not as classic (for me) as the 1990 one, but I can't complain about anything in 'IT'. It's also great to see an R-rated horror movie become such a huge blockbuster at the Box Office; hopefully this means will get more R-rated horror flicks (instead of the routine PG-13 ones).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/SXjABrLbV7A",,Anonymous,Horror
One of the greatest horror films that I think the genre has ever seen.,"Other than some really really minor issues I had with the film, It ultimately provided audiences with one of the greatest horror films that I think the genre has ever seen.

On the other hand, Bill skarsgard as pennywise, dam* he is creepy as fu**.

"Old or new IT fan? Well, read to see what to expect.","I like this version of the movie, not more or less than the 1990 mini series, each one has its own charm.No spoilers.1. This movie is more stick to the book than the original mini- series. Of course some changes have been made as all book to movies.2. Is not for hardcore terror fans because the Director killed the suspense or tension from some scenes by adding jokes right after a scary Pennywise scene. Even though all people in the movie theater jumped more than once.3. People saying the 1990 mini-series is scarier it's because they were KIDS when they watched it. I'm a hardcore IT fan, I love it since the mini series was released but if I re-watch it, I realized it was not that scary but when kid I had a different vision and innocence.4. For those who complain about CGI, what they were expecting? This is not 70's, 80's or 90's, ALL horror movies have CGI on this days, or they still like to see ketchup as blood and jello as brains?If you go trying to compare it against the mini series or expecting to be 100% faithful to the book, let me save you some money, you WON'T like it. In the other-hand, if you go open minded you'll end satisfied.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Decent, but not great","Condensing several hundred long book into a movie, even if that movie has two parts, certainly isn't an easy task. It wouldn't be wise to compare movie with a book, as it simply not the same format. What a movie can do, is be true to the spirit of the source material. Stephen King's books always had that chilly, creeping threat that you could sense would culminate. What I think this movie lacks precisely that, sense of threat. The movie itself seems like a crossover between horror, coming of age film with hints of comedy. In that, it is true to the source material (which I didn't find comedic but o.k.) I am not sure what to think of the rest. Certainly, as we are to expect a second part, it's yet to be seen what that will have to offer. The whole picture might be different but, for now, we have to stick with what is presented to us.It's the horror part that I find lacking. The feeling of dread is certainly subjective and in that respect, I didn't find the film scary. It has jump scares, it has it's share of monsters, it has it's atmosphere but there is never a feeling of real dread. Early in the movie we are presented with a killing of young boy Georgie. But, in the context of the rest of the film, the gruesome scene of arm bitten off a youngster seems as unnecessary shock value. We are introduced to main characters, a group of unpopular kids who are bound together in their struggle against evil entity in the form of a clown, that feeds on children. In facing this entity, they are also struggling against their own fears, a real life type of fears like being bullied or being in a domestic abuse.What was a huge let down for me is that these kids never seem genuinely afraid. How can a movie, a horror movie, be scary if characters don't seem to be scared. Many reviews focused on children's characters cursing all the way through. While cursing is in fact usual in that age when kids think they are more grown than they are, it's quite naive to think that they would react with constant ""oh f***"" when facing their worst fears, and then simply shrug it off like almost nothing happened. I mean, they react all the time like they are in a hunted house in an amusement park. No matter how grown a kid of 12, 13 year might think he/she is, he/she would probably scream ""mommy"" and not ""f***"" when in mortal danger. The whole point of scariness of it should stem from an innocence being under attack, and how characters become adults. But in this movies it's like we already have adults in bodies of children. All in all, I don't fund fear factor to be convincing in this movie. Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise is really good, but the clown itself has little else to do than to be scary.The atmosphere of the movie is good, it's not a cliché. Good lightning, shadow play, the eighties feel are really great. The premise of a gang of children is not new but in this movie, it doesn't feel old. In that respect, as a coming of age movie, it does (no pun intended) reasonably well, but there are better King's adaptations in that respect (Stand by me for example, that has bigger emotional impact).I also find the way in which story unfolds to be a bit disconnected, one thing leads to another almost automatically and there is little space to get to know characters or their relationships to one another (which, in the end is crucial for their victory over Pennywise the dancing clown).All in all, how much you enjoy the movie depends on what you expect from it and how sensitive you are to being scared. My friend, whom I watched the movie with, found it pretty frightening. Anyway, my conclusion is that it is a good summer movie but certainly not masterpiece.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Much better than expected.,"The child actors are pretty much the stars of this movie. The original put more focus on tension building and specifically Pennywise (played by the great Tim Curry). This is where the remake is different in a good and bad way. The good thing is that the pace of the remake is better, in my opinion. The bad thing is that the new Pennywise isn't nearly as scary as Curry's version.When I first heard about a remake being made, I thought to myself: Not another stupid remake. Truthfully, this one wasn't actually that bad.Now that almost 30 years have passed since the original, technology has advanced and many things just look way better than they used to in front of the camera.This movie's actually funny at times. I don't remember finding things funny with the first one, but of course I watched that one when I was 10. Remember how everyone who has seen the movie at a young age describes it at traumatising?Anyways, even if a remake - still better than most stupid horror flicks. Probably thanks to Cary Joji Fukunaga (writer, producer, True Detective-creator).6.8/10 way better than expected.",,Anonymous,Horror
If It was not a horror.,"In the past years, since I watch films not just for fun, but as a piece of cultural marvel and I simply didn't feel the originality to write anything.And I feel the same with some genres, where the creators does not will, can, able to find anything new – and profitable at the same time. It was a nicely shot, well directed (after the first terrible hour) and really really well played movie. I don't want to argue about the raison d'etre of horror, but even my mother tongue is not English, the first thing flashed in my mind is the word: pointless.This movie has a first and second Act, that is trying to push the standard horror clichés, like the strange camera angles, raising music tones and sharp, choppy cuts. This made me a bit angry, but it also spotlighted the biggest problem of the whole industrialized movie making. They have to make money, and just like any other undertaking, the studios have to position their products for the customers. So we sometimes get this fragmented kind of ""product"".On the other hand, I think this movie worked pretty well, when it (or It – ha ha :) ) didn't try scare the sh*t out of the audience with jump scare or with the previously mentioned aggressive method. And here comes the pointless side of the ""horror"".I have no problem with the fear. But it must be a tool not a goal. You rarely can get a great dramatic play and an amusement center in the same room. But when it is used as a tool, to settle the whole story and its own Universe with its own rules, then it could work.The lighting was good, the child actors were great, the cinematography was okay, the music I don't remember. At the end of the day did I like the movie? Yes. But not because it was a well- mad-piece-of-art, but because I had some really great moments and a great story behind all the ""effort"" of making this great mystery drama to a horror movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good Fun,"As usual I didn't know too much about IT heading for the cinema beyond it probably being based on the Stephen King novel. It was indeed based on the Stephen King novel and tells the tale of a group of bullied school kids. The school kids also suffer rather dysfunctional families, but they have an even bigger problem ... They are being terrorised by a supernatural clown in a town which suffers more than the usual number of missing children.The movie is very nicely played by the actors and it's nice to have a connection with the characters. It's the usual horror film formula with a mix of laughs and frights throughout the movie. If you love the genre then you'll probably love IT and it's a pretty entertaining couple of hours.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
IT (2017) Film Review,"The new horror film IT which is the remake of the IT film from 1990 which starred Tim Curry as Pennywise The Clown with Bill Skarsgård as Pennywise The Clown in the remake film based on a Stephen King book.New Line Cinema's horror thriller IT, directed by Andrés Muschietti (Mama), is based on the hugely popular Stephen King novel of the same name, which has been terrifying readers for decades. When children begin to disappear in the town of Derry, Maine, USA, a group of young kids are faced with their biggest fears when they square off against an evil clown named Pennywise (Swedish actor Bill Skarsgård - Allegiant, Atomic Blonde and is the son of Swedish actor Stellan Skarsgård and the younger brother of Swedish actor Alexander Skarsgård), whose history of murder and violence dates back for centuries.The cast in IT includes American actor Jaeden Lieberher (Midnight Special, St. Vincent) as Bill Denbrough who has a bit of a stammer, Jeremy Ray Taylor as Bill Hanscom, Sophia Lillis (A Midsummer Night's Dream, 37) as Beverly Marsh, Canadian actor Finn Wolfhard (US TV Series Stranger Things) as Richie Tozier, Chosen Jacobs (US TV Series Hawaii Five-0) as Mike Hanlon, American actor Jack Dylan Grazer as Eddie Kaspbrak, Wyatt Oleff (Guardians Of The Galaxy films, Someone Marry Barry) as Stanley Uris, Australian actor Nicholas Hamilton (The Dark Tower, Captain Fantastic) as Henry Bowers, Jake Sim (TV Series Raising Expectations) as Belch Huggins, Logan Thompson as Victor Criss, Owen Teague (US TV Series Bloodline, Cell) as Patrick Hockstetter, Jackson Robert Scott as Georgie Denbrough Bill's younger brother, Stephen Bogaert (X-Men: Apocalypse, American Psycho 2000) as Mr. Marsh Beverly's dad, Stuart Hughes (This Beautiful City, Troubled Waters) as Officer Bowers, Geoffrey Pounsett (Resident Evil: Apocalypse, Falling Fire) as Zach Denbrough Bill and Georgie's dad, Pip Dwyer as Sharon Denbrough Bill and Georgie's mum and Zach's wife, Molly Atkinson as Sonia Kasprak, American actor Steven Williams (Corrina, Corrina, The Trust) as Leroy Hanlon, Canadian actress Elizabeth Saunders (Amelia) as Mrs. Starret, Megan Charpentier (Mama, Red Riding Hood) as Gretta, Joe Bostick (Lars And The Real Girl) as Mr. Keene, Canadian actor Ari Cohen (Maps To The Stars, The Tracey Fragments) as Rabbi Uris, Canadian actor Anthony Ulc (The Entitled, Breakout) as Joe the Butcher, Spanish actor Javier Botet (Crimson Peak, Mama) as Hobo, Katie Lunman as Betty Ripsom, Canadian actress Tatum Lee as Judith, Canadian actor Neil Crone (Pushing Tin, Hollywoodland) as Chief Borton and Sonia Gascón as Mrs. Ripsom.Filming locations in IT includes cities, places like Bangor, Maine, USA, Toronto, Hamilton, Oshawa, Pickering, Port Hope, West Montrose, Ontario, Canada.Overall IT is a good good scary horror film filled with scary horror moments, gory violence, on the edge of your seat stuff, things that will scare you and make you go oh my god or wow or woah, kids, teenagers, adults, trouble makers, dark dirty sewers, nice scenery, family, love, friendship, team work, togetherness, loyalty, some bizarre moments, flashbacks, bad dreams, psychological warfare, mind games, school bullies, outstanding performances from the actors and actresses who played the kids along with Bill Skarsgård as Pennywise The Clown who is my opinion nails it as Pennywise The Clown who is more scary and creepier than the Pennywise The Clown that Tim Curry played in the IT film from 1990 which I have seen once and many other things throughout the film.So I will give IT an overall rating of 3 out of 5 stars and IT is worth seeing if you like the IT film from 1990 and other horror films along the same lines as this.So if you get the chance to see IT in the cinema then you should go and see it sooner than later and in my opinion the new remake IT is better than the original IT from 1990 but that's just my opinion but you should go and see the new IT and then you can make up your own mind on which IT is better the original film from 1990 or the remake film from 2017.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"A decent reboot, but will never hold candle to the great Tim Curry","I've seen the new movie, IT Chapter One, one late Saturday night, in keeping with the tradition of seeing the horror or thriller movie only on the late night.The movie is obviously better than the broadcast television version in all aspects, due to high production value overall, but one thing is certain.While Bill Skarsgård did a good job portraying the villain, Tim Curry is much more nuanced and thus creepier and scarier. It comes down to characterization.Bill Skarsgård's character is way over the top in characterization, but maybe his portrayal is merely inspired by the novel. Tim Curry's characterization is perfect, which might well be one of the best portrayals of a horror-film villain in cinema history, that includes television.The new movie is fairly faithful to the novel, with plenty of profanity uttered by the young actors. That might shock some prudes, but I don't have a problem with it. I swore a lot when I was a child on the verge of adolescence, as well as similarly curious about sensuality. No child is too (to wit, perfectly) innocent in development.Of course, the new movie had to omit the more explicit scenes that involve sexuality as originated in the novel. Otherwise, there would be the ""moral panic"" protest over the ""tamely filmed and sensibly edited"" (implied) erotic scenes not unlike, say, The Last Temptation of Christ when that film came out in 1988, the same year this new movie takes place at the beginning.I am more into psychological horror with slow pacing, which is so rare as to be non-existent. The classic movies with psychological terror plus slow pacing would be Jaws, The Changeling, the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Shining and Japanese horror Ringu, the latter that to this day I consider one of the scariest movie watching experiences I had (the other ""terrifying"" movie-going experience would be Irreversible and I Stand Alone, both by the French auteur and provocateur Gaspar Noe, and both equally disorienting in harsh content and insane cinematography & editing), because of its mystery that led to the shocking and unexpected twist that blew my mind with my jaw dropping sense of palpable horror.This said, I am very much a jaded moviegoer. This is why I was not even scared or phased when I saw the new movie, thanks to ""cheap"" jump scares with obvious CGI meshed with the makeup effects. Although a few ""lingering"" scenes, such as the bloody bathroom, impressed me in experiencing what it's like to go through the psychological terror.Perhaps if the new IT movie have the emphasis on practical makeup effects, albeit more expensive than CGI, then it would easily scare me as well as many similarly jaded moviegoers who know cheap jump scare scenes when they see it, that cannot even make them jump at the seat. Unfortunately, CGI is the standard visual effects, and that lessened the scare factor of this movie. The good or mediocre ""scariest"" movies with practical makeup effects were last made in the 90's, in particular Hellraiser series, notably Part III.With all this said, the young cast did a fine job, given the intense adapted screenplay with heavy language and other risqué content. I know that if my young nieces and nephews ask me to take them to see this movie, I might hesitate not because of its scary and nightmarish scenes and the villain but because of its language alone that would be a bad influence.I look forward to the second chapter, now that Chapter One is expected to be a big box office hit. It hit all the right notes, but it cannot hold the candle to Tim Curry. He should have returned to the role, instead of a relatively young actor who nearly hams it up portraying Pennywise the Demonic Clown.By the way, although I disagree with the novelist Stephen King's shrill politics lately (he gets a cut of the royalty from the success of the new IT franchise and merchandise), I had to see the new version of IT, because hype -- the first release of the movie teaser and trailer that saw tens of millions of view count -- justifies the commendable quality of this movie. The author was so impressed that he praised the movie in a tweet earlier this year.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"IT floats.....okay...done that dumb joke, lets review!!","I do not go out of my way to watch horror films. I scare easily for one thing and I HATE jump scares which all horror movies seem to have. Jump scares are just lazy tools to make a film scary by having a sudden, violent thing happen to a dumb character and just making the music louder to provoke a reaction. Having a monster or character that is actually scary and has menace to him/her is much more enjoyable to watch and infinitely scarier. This film delivers that but still has jump scares in IT.I can sum up IT by saying that IT is just a scary version of the Goonies without pirates, retarded strongmen named sloth and treasure. That is not such a bad thing but I just could not shake this impression and it took me out of the film a little bit, especially whenever the fat kid was involved. I just couldn't help thinking ""sloth love chunk"" whenever he was there.Okay I have talked about the bad parts, of which there are few, let's talk about the good. This film has very good pacing for starters. Most films have scenes that are filler and serve no purpose whereas all the scenes in IT help with plot and character development. The editing is good with no shaky cam going on when there are chase scenes which is my pet peeve. What is the point of having shake cam in scary scenes or chase scenes??? But luckily this film doesn't do that and that adds to feeling of dread when pennywise is coming straight for you.The music is very well mixed with the climactic parts being well complemented by music that ups the intensity of the scene and allows the audience to feel the appropriate emotion. As well as score music there is also use of pop music which sets the time of this film (late 1980's) quite well.The plot is like any other horror plot and follows some conventions like a haunted house or things being hidden in basements but these things are a given in horror films. The film surprised me by having most violent happenings take place during the day and sometimes in the open. Because there is another chapter for this movie already being produced it might be that we learn more about Pennywise and what is he and why does he do these things. It was not explained in this first chapter but that is to be expected I suppose.The characters are very well played by the child actors, each giving 100% and looking genuinely scared and not breaking character. Child actors are always a mixed bag; some can be great, some can destroy a movie totally. In this film you can tell that they all cared, yes there are some fake crying scenes by some of the cast and this is not great but I usually don't expect much from child actors so this did not ruin my experience.Not only is the acting good, the character development is good. In the space of this film we see all the kids start to grow up, take on a bigger responsibility and fight their own demons. Beverly Marsh in particular starts off as the social outcast but ends up being a hero of the moment and shows great courage in adversity.With a good plot and some great, scary scenes this film will give me nightmares but like I said I scare easily anyway. This film, for me, is let down by the jump scares which are cheap and the Goonies vibe I got from it. Everything else was pretty good and I would say watch it if you are or aren't a King fan. It is for everyoneexcept people under 15. Because of laws and stuff.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
See It to believe It,"I'm truly surprised by some of the negative reviews for this movie. Honestly the 1 star ratings are absolute nonsense and to be fair, anything below a 6 rating is questionable at best. Is this a perfect rendition of the novel...? Of course not. Of all the books I've read that made it to film, I cannot think of a single one that was spot on.That being said, I've been a horror movie fan for over 30 years and to say I've seen a ton of horror films in that time is putting it mildly. There's no way that you can go into this with an open mind and come out saying it (IT) was a 1 star movie. It has genuinely creepy moments and some solid jump scares. And the CGI that everyone is whining about was rendered very well. Let's face it, practical FX are cool, but you can certainly tell it's rubber a lot of times so yes, sometimes CGI is obvious as well. But this movie has some of the best CGI I've seen aside from the massive budget super hero movies of late.So if you are going to see this thinking it will be an exact telling of the novel,you'll be disappointed as you would with any film churned from a best selling novel. If you go in thinking it's going to be a remake of the TV series (which thankfully it's not because the only good thing about that was Tim Curry's performance, which could have been even better on the big screen)well you'll be disappointed as well. Me...I'm going to go see it again while it's still on the big screen.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A film of literally 2 halves,"REVIEW - ITSome films need to be remade, a prime example of this is a previous film I reviewed called 'Would You Rather' and some films should be left well alone, for example the countless remakes of Spiderman, Ghostbusters and of course Nightmare On Elm Street (which is being remade yet again).I first saw IT a very long time ago and I'll admit at the time I just didn't get IT (sorry for the pun) but I'm glad to say that with this remake I actually understood the story.Honestly the first hour is slow and in places I felt it dragged on but from about 70 minutes into the film (half way through) IT picked up the pace and became an enjoyable watch.IT reminded me of another classic film called 'Stand By Me'. A group of kids facing the challenges of growing up with parents who are.........So in summary, skip the first 70 minutes and just watch the second half (you won't miss anything important).A film of literally 2 halves.I will make one prediction, there will be a sequel and I'm guessing it will be called IT lives.Rating 6 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fun and Creepy,"This movie isn't scary, but it is creepy. It manages to have a good dark atmosphere with some clever writing sprinkled in. As with all horror and with comedy what you find scary or funny will be entirely subjective, but this movie does manage to create a beautifully creepy experience whether you are scared or not. It is highly enjoyable and I am particularly fond of the acting performances given by the children. I would highly recommend seeing this movie in theaters.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Decent but getting over-hyped,"I enjoyed IT. Great acting overall, dialogue is excellent. Very much in the vein of Stand By Me. As well there are some decent scares.Things I didn't like though, were some terrible CGI. I'm a stickler for bad fx and there's a few shots that look quite bad.This movie is an example of trailers barely saving anything for the theater. Almost every major scare was shown in the trailers to some extent. Overall IT is a fun movie, but getting way too over-hyped.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
IT Delivers on every level,"IT is a movie that comes together incredibly tightly and brings a story that many of us know to life in a new frightening way. I enjoyed it so much that I have gone and seen it twice since it opened. While I wondered if the replay value would still be high, IT managed to bring forward even more of the subtle things that I missed the first time through.The kids did an amazing job and by the end you felt an understanding for each of them and their place in the Losers. If anything they did such an amazing job, I'm not sure how the part II with adults will be able to top it.Lastly Pennywise, while I am a massive fan of Tim Curry, it was exciting to see Bill Skarsgard bring this character to life. There are so many levels of complexity on display and the intricacies he portrays will certainly make this a character that will be haunting dreams for years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Why?,Opening scene is great but then it's just a bunch of stupid kids. Even though the original movie has cheesy SFX and the acting can be cringe worthy at least the kids were kids. The remake has kids cursing every other word and it just pisses me off. Why can't they just show kids being actual kids.,2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Frightening in parts but massively over-hyped,"The enormous amount of hype surrounding this movie made it something of a must-see for any horror fan, including myself. I was prepared to be let down, as I always am when a movie is talked up so much, but I was left with mixed feelings overall. There's no doubt that 'IT' is a brilliant production and there are some effectively frightening individual scenes but, as a whole, it just doesn't live up to the hype.The first half of the film is too slow. It contains more laughs than scares and, while I appreciate the need for character development, many of the scenes are completely pointless and not at all relevant to the overall plot. It also relies heavily on cheap jump scares, which is particularly disappointing given the naturally creepy and disturbing nature of Pennywise. The film picks up though and the final quarter of 'IT' is a real treat for any horror fan. It moves at a breathless pace, maintaining a high level of tension with a long, relentlessly creepy final sequence. On balance, the positives outweigh the films flaws and I would have enjoyed it more if it hadn't been so over-hyped.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
You'll float too!!,"Had to write it down as soon as I could. I've watched my fair share of horror movies (believe me the list is HUGE) but from what I could sum up IT Movie might very well be the best of the best. Can't believe I'm saying this but I think IT is far better than even The Conjuring and most other renowned horror masterpieces - brilliant cinematography and CGI, beautiful blend of humor and horror, the horror sequences (more like the terror sequences) are more atmospheric and artsy rather than cheap 'jump scares'. The best part is, Pennywise is the second clown ever to get under my skin since Heath Ledger's Joker. This movie is not for faint-hearted people and most-definitely not for people with Coulrophobia (fear of clowns). If you are a true horror fan then read no more and go watch IT.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Yet another nightmare for coulrophobics,"A group of misfit children deal with evil in the form of a clown. This is the second version of Steven King's eponymous novel, and while the CGI effects allow for horrors that are magnitudes better than those in the 1990 made-for-TV version, I didn't find the new film to be that much better than the miniseries. The kids are fine but, between Spielberg films, other King films, and shows like ""Stranger Things"", I felt like I'd seen it all before. I also found the film slow and meandering as the various kids, and their problems, were introduced. Only the first part of the novel is covered and there really didn't seem to be enough material to fill 135 min. There were some very effective scenes (the opening death of Georgie and the dancing clown comes to mind), but my primary criticism is central to the story: Bill Skarsgård's interpretation of Pennywise the Dancing Clown was too creepy when in 'friendly' mode (compared to Tim Curry's version), which to me diluted the impact of the transition from 'good' clown to 'killer' clown. Anyone familiar with the story will know that in the second half the kids return as adults to Derry to challenge the demonic harlequin. It will be interesting to see if the follow-up film follows a simple horror trajectory (as did the first version) or tries to stay true to the new-agey weirdness of the book.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
So dull I was falling asleep.,"1 star. Awful. Why? They stripped it of all it's mystery and instead made a bombastic movie that is NOT interesting, not engrossing, not scary. It is DULL! I was falling asleep during the dialog. The characters aren't interesting and the actors aren't interesting. The only pleasant thing about the entire film is the scenery.This is a screeching, loud, overdone film that lacks any fascination.The first film with Tim Curry draws you in and doesn't let go until the spider comes out of the cave. Then, it loses it's audience. This film loses it's audience in the first 10 minutes and they are gone, not to be drawn back in. People were looking at their watches.Just go get the original on DVD or re-read the book. This is BAD.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A Smart, Sophisticated & Satisfying Delight That's Fresh, Funny & Frightening","A smart, sophisticated & satisfying delight that's fresh, funny & frightening in just the right doses, It: Chapter One (simply known as It) is a first-rate example of a contemporary horror done right, and is a richly realized & expertly crafted chiller that makes up for a fascinating entry in the world of horror while doubling as a wonderful coming-of-age story too.",,Anonymous,Horror
An Imperfect Circus,"IT, is a meaty book with no pun intended. There are lots of chapters, sub-plots, back stories and seemingly unrelated pieces of information that the reader has to absorb during their journey - so much so, that it requires multiple reads to really get to grips with all its nuances and clever sleight-of-hands.IT, the movie, is a perfectly well manufactured, formulated attempt at emulating a story that - if I'm completely honest - never really lent itself to the big screen (or the little one for that matter) and here's why I think that is.The story itself is far too rich and layered to be condensed into a film with a run time of 2 hours something. Paradoxically, it's too direct and concise to be elongated into a series of films. The net result is a standalone that, even if you've read the book, won't answer any of the questions you're likely to have as the credits roll - so here are a number of things that I think would have helped its cause.Firstly, this film shouldn't have been given a 15 cert. With the exception of a couple of scenes it could have been passed as a 12A, opening it up to a younger audience who I think would enjoy this movie a great deal, in the same way that Stranger Things has managed to appeal - but unfortunately, the producers and accountants have sat on the fence with this; choosing to market IT to an older audience for fear of softening the reputation of the book and therefore putting 'grown-ups' off altogether.Secondly, the cap-tipping to projects such as Stranger Things and The Goonies is all too obvious to see here. It could be argued that this version wouldn't have even been made without the inspiration of the aforementioned, but that didn't give the creators licence to plagiarise in such an overt fashion - and sadly, that's exactly what has happened. While the whole 80's renaissance is welcome, the approach taken here now looks hackneyed in comparison.That said, it's not a BAD movie - it's just a movie you've seen before. The jumps are where the jumps should be, the screams are where the screams should be. It attempts to please all the people, all the time; and as such it's not a GREAT movie. The Goonies was a GREAT movie, Stranger Things is a GREAT series; IT is still waiting to be adapted in a way that really resonates with the book; this version however, doesn't do that despite I'm sure, the sincerest of efforts. There will be a sequel; or perhaps a set of sequels - whether or not they're needed, remains to be seen.6.3/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

an incredible rebuild of an epic novel,"This movie was single-handedly the best of its gender so far. I'm not gonna compare It with the latest release Annabelle, since the two of them share so little. While Annablle focus is giving us a bunch of scares, building up a dark atmosphere that compensates the lack of neutral dialogues, the movie It perfectly combines scary-creepy elements with comedy ones, and God, how did it blend so well. I read the book a few months ago, but I can recall of everything important, and I believe I saw at least 80% of the first half in the screenplay. It felt just good to point a scene out and shout ""OMG, it's exactly like this on the book!"". when I left the theater I was in awe. The scenes was very well shot, and Bil Skarsgard was amazing as Pennywise. I'm looking forward for part 2.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Much better movie than reading the horribly thick and over detailed book..,"... which is was Stephen King is known for. I read this book over 25 years ago. It's over 1,100 pages, and mine was a paperback - meaning, the binding fell apart like 3-4 times, which was OK, it was so hard to hold a paperback that thick!I took me roughly 9 months to read, I was working the graveyard shift and either we were busy, or bored out of our minds. I don't even know who left the book there, but I saw it, picked it up and started readying during the down times. Honestly, it took me so long to read, and it was detailed beyond what was required.. I can't remember maybe 20% of what I read. I just know this movie is good. Although it's a remake from a movie in the 80s - for once, the remake didn't destroy the original. I think both films are good.If I had to compare to any other type movie, it's similar to Freddy Kruger, a little gore and violence, mostly just scary situations - but at the same time, managed to add some lighthearted humor to the film.RECOMMEND: If you only see 1 horror movie this year... this is the one. Maybe just because I'm older and these movies hold some nostalgia for me??",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
IT rocks,"Remakes, remakes, remakes. It seems every time you turn around, Hollywood is out once more make money by simply updating a previous hit. Often these remakes pale in comparison, but every once in a while, you get a film worthy of social media blow up and hype. This weekend, the highly anticipated, and over-advertised, IT remake crawls out of the studio shadows and attempts to make us face our fears. Can Hollywood bring King's famous work into the modern century of film, or will it merely make us scream in fright at horrible it is. Robbie K back from a two-week hiatus to bring you another review. Let's get started!LIKES:Creepy: Horror movies are supposed to be scary, and fans of my work know I love it when the studio crawls under my skin. IT has plenty of moments that creeped me out, primarily the use of shadows, sound, and those small details that teased the audience to the scares. A nice variety of tactics exists in this movie to make you squirm in your seat, all led by the deliciously evil Pennywise (Bill Skarsgård) and all his pasty white glory. One may find another of disturbing scenes in this movie, primarily in that cold, seeking stare he loves to use so much. Yes, It certainly mirrored the atmosphere portrayed in the book.Acting: Seldom do I say a horror film has good acting, but IT hit a home run with all the actors chosen to bring the characters to life. Instead of the usual airheaded, shallow characters who did nothing but scream and curse, this cast portrayed a much broader emotional rolewhile still cursing. This group did such a good job that I actually liked and invested energy into the characters, which isn't usually the case in modern horror cinema. While I can't give shout outs to each one, I certainly will give props to how much they sold the summer adventure to me, almost like Stranger Things meets the Goonies, with a little more demented atmosphere on top. Of course, the real props go to Skarsgard, whose portrayal as Pennywise is certainly a major part to the horror he brings. His delivery is incredible, that shadowy, whisper like voice that mimics the element of the movie. Throw the laugh and creepy body acting, to get the complete demonic nature of Pennywise.The Story: Stephen King knows how to write a story, and thank goodness, this director knew how to bring it to life. IT finally proves you can have a scary movie with a plot worth investing in. This version follows the book very well, managing to develop the characters, lay out the story, and still bring all the creepy parts into beautiful detail and length. The result is a more engaging movie, increased suspense, and an emotional roller coaster as you live the adventure through these kids. This aspect is my favorite component of the movie and certainly worth the price of admission, including the little revelation at the endwhich fans of the book will know.DISLIKES:More Suspense, Less Scares: IT might be creepy, but I wasn't as scared as I thought I would be. I, nor my friends, didn't jump at all. Despite creepy build-ups and a setting that welcomes scares, IT still has the same predictable foreshadowing that is used a little too often that it dilutes the big revelation. While it was certainly more suspenseful in regards to the adventure, I don't foresee myself getting nightmares from this movie.Unbalanced at times: IT has a lot of things perfectly done in this movie, but there are a few moments where they seemed to drop the ball on their characters. True, I haven't read the book in a long time, but I seemed to remember each kid having almost equal involvement in fighting the shapeshifting embodiment of fear. In this film though, I felt they dropped the characters at time to the backburner, choosing to focus on just three of the main characters.The Computer Effects: The past two dislikes are minor and just space filling, but the only major dislike was the CGI effects. When IT conforms into the more realistic entities crafted by makeup and costumes, I would feel grossed out, sickened, and get goosebumps. However, when the CGI moments came into play, the realism faded away to cheesy effects that were more humorous than terrifying. Sure, the creatures themselves would make anyone wet themselves, but their portrayal In this movie could have been maximized if they stuck to makeup effects. In addition, some of the convulsing moments were funny to watch, again due to the semi-realistic effects. While certainly not the worst visual effects, it could have used a little tune up to be honest.The VERDICT:IT proves that you can make a remake that doesn't stink and may actually be truer to the book. While not the scariest movie to haunt the theater, it is fantastically creepy and will certainly get your skin crawling. In addition, the acting and story are fully developed and bring about a wonderful tale that will keep you hooked into the movie wondering where the end of the adventure would be. Yes, the computer effects need a little work, but otherwise a solid addition to the horror genre and a worthy trip to the theater.My scores are:Drama/Horror: 9.0 Movie Overall: 8.0",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Creepy but humorous, this horror piece floats above expectations","I didn't have to high hopes going into this film but I was really surprised with the results. Instead of only cheap jump scares to completely make up it's run time, even though there are some, this film mainly has a creepy and suspenseful tone that lasts the entire film. Also the film gets you to care with all of the main characters and show off the great acting talent that the leads possess before diving deep into the clown mayhem. The leads all show great range, switching from dramatic to comedic scenes with ease. Pennywise is incredible in this film and the actor completely sells the creepy factor that will keep you on your toes. He made me wanting more. This is a great time at the theater and would gladly see it again.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
I expected more from the great I.T,"--No spoilers here--Granted I'm very late to the party , but having heard a lot about 'I.T' for several years and seen it become a common connotation to the term 'horror film' I was expecting great things when I finally got round to watching. For me personally I now consider the movie to be a bit overrated , but not all bad...I wouldnt call it a terrible or even a bad movie; the acting is pretty great all round, creepy and well executed villain, well shot and nice setting. For me the issue was simply the lack of basic fear factor. In my opinion all good horror movies excel by keeping the source of fear/conflict unknown for a substantial time, these movies build gradual suspense for often nearly half the run time and then take a well paced run up to an adrenaline pumping final quarter. I.T however travels a different path by introducing the source of fear factor very early on, therefore my criticism lies with the fact that in my opinion, this fear did not build or evolve in any way throughout the 2nd half of the movie.My conclusion would be that despite great acting and many staples of a good horror movie, I.T simply isnt really that scary. Worth a watch, but falls short of being a truly scary watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Proper scary.  Proper quality .  Stephen King at his very, very best.","Right.  This is 'Stranger Things: The Nightmare'.Which means it's; 'ET, The Goonies, Stand by Me: The Nightmare.'Not least because it stars Finn Wolfhard.And, if nothing else it has unearthed the preternaturally beautiful Sophia Lillis, as Beverley, who, like Wolfhard, surely has a massive career ahead of her.It is proper scary.Kids fight monsters.  What's not to like?Nothing beats proper scary in my book and few writers create scariness better than Stephen King.  The Shining and Carrie are two of the best horror films ever made and this is his hat-trick.We open in year 27 (1989 with lots of neat historical references) of a 27 year cycle in which mayhem descends on the small town of Derry (in Maine?) and follows a group of Losers; geeks, fatties, stutterers, black kids, scaredycats and a tomboy with attitude (Beverley) who also provides the love interest.The movie starts with stutterer Bill (beautifully played by Jaeden Leiberher) losing his beloved younger brother, Georgie, to a demonic clown who lives in the town's sewers.  It's the start of a series of disappearances amongst children in the town.  And the clown, played superbly by Bill Skarskgard, called Pennywise is out to wreak havoc having been let loose in year 27.The movie has plenty of jumps.  And some of the appearances of Pennywise are frankly terrifying.Despite its length, over two hours, it maintains interest throughout and the story develops brilliantly.  Top marks to director Andy Muschietti who is adept at creating mood, atmosphere and moments of humour.""Who invited Molly Ringwold"" asks Wolfhard in reference to the short red haired Beverley.  It's a laugh out loud moment (and Wolfhard has them all).There's a neat subplot about school bullying (that begins a little clichéd but develops nicely) with a good performance from Nicholas Hamilton as a proper bully, Henry Bowers.But the heart of the movie is dedicated to scaring the 'you know what' out of you.And it succeeds triumphantly.It's a great horror movie.  It really is.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Right Stuff.,"It's a brave man who takes on the role of Pennywise the clown after Tim Curry's scene-stealing turn in the original miniseries, but this second adaptation of Stephen King's novel sees Bill Skarsgård making the character his own, turning in a memorably different take on the shape-shifting monster that preys on the kids of Derry, Maine (this time in the summer of 1989).Buck toothed with glowing eyes, a disquieting voice and a truly sinister smile (plus a few impressive dance moves), Bill Skarsgård's Pennywise sure is the stuff of nightmares, the actor more than deserving of the praise he has garnered. His is not the only great performance in director Andy Muschietti's re-imagining of the King classic: the kids who play the plucky youngsters who fight back against the monster are all excellent, with Stranger Things star Finn Wolfhard putting in a particularly memorable turn as wisecracking Richie Tozier (he gets all of the best lines!).Fright-wise, I can't say that I was ever on the edge of my seat, nor did I jump (years of watching horror films has made me difficult to scare), but I was thoroughly entertained throughout. My daughter, on the other hand, frequently hid her eyes behind her hands, as did the woman sat next to her, so the film clearly had the desired effect on those two.I rate It an impressive 8 beeps out of 10, and look forward to the next movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

You will float too...,"""It"" is a horror movie in which we watch a group of kids who were bullied, banding together in order to destroy a clown monster. This happens in the summer of 1989 in the Town of Derry and after the disappearance of some local kids who were never found. The only clue that exists after the disappearance of each kid is bloody remains.I had watched the first movie when I was a child and I was very scared of it, I thought of it as the most horrific movie and since I was very young it made sense. I have to admit that I liked this movie a lot, the plot was amazing for a horror movie, there were many scary scenes and much of suspense. In addition to this, I have to say that ""It"" made me feel that I was a member of this group of children and made me also feel the stress, the agony and the suspense that felt these children. In comparison with the old movie of 1990, I have to admit that the old movie was more like a splatter movie and of course since the evolution of technology the new movie had more options and greater potential than the old one. I liked the direction of this movie which made by Andy Muschietti. It has also to be mentioned the interpretations of Bill Skarsgård who played as Pennywise, Sophia Lillis who played as Beverly Marsh and Jaeden Lieberher who played as Bill Denbrough.To sum up I have to say that ""It"" is a very good horror movie with a decent budget which was used wisely and correctly. I strongly recommend this movie to everyone and especially to those who love horror movies and of course to those who have already watched the old movie because I am sure that this movie will be better and it will exceed your expectations.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A missed opportunity,"This is a brief review without spoilers.""It"" has serious narrative problems. The story of corrupted childhood and unresolved adolescent trauma with an analogous terrorising clown is a strong bedrock on which to build character and story but something went wrong with this film. Was it the script or the editing? Perhaps both but regardless the narrative structure is disjointed and jarring. The opening of the film is strong and places character at the fore, where it belongs (for both the children and Pennywise the clown) but that soon gives way to episodic, fragmented and at times illogical storytelling.The children's life experiences shape their fears but too often these are unexplored or are seen much later in the film loosing a linear structure which is vital to build psychological suspense. Pennywise is pretty much reduced to being the scary clown who literally chases the kids.There are some positives; the performances are good, there are some good visual touches e.g. Pennywise climbing out of the fridge and the lighting and cinematography are good.

"We all float down here. Yes, we do!","I enjoyed every bit of this movie. Although I haven't read the book I think the movie explores a different angle that the one we saw in the miniseries released in the 90's. It renovates the story by exploiting the fears that each kid has, giving a little more strength to their characters individually. The CGI at some point might seem like a little too much but it helps to create the ambiance and drives the story right where it needs to go.The best part of this movie, by far, is the performance of everyone involved. The kids play their part beautifully, but Bill Skarsgård is the crème de la crème; he reinvents Pennywise in a very darker and violent way. Skarsgård does not try to fill Tim Curry's shoes, cause that'd be practically impossible, he goes in a different direction creating something new, assuming the role of Pennywise as his own and not some role he has to surpass, which he achieves amazingly.It's not the typical horror movie and this exact reason is why, at least in my opinion, it's refreshing and scary in a unique way. Hands down one of the best horror movies of the last couple of years.They intended to make something different, a movie that had its own essence and not just a plain imitation, and they succeeded wonderfully.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
'It' is more than your average horror film,"Among the entries in the Stephen King library, few stories have frightened audiences the way 1990's made-for-TV movie 'It.' Flash forward 17 years, and Pennywise the clown has made an impact on a new generation in Andy Muschietti's take on the classic coming of age tale.The reason 'It' works so well is because it's not just about chocking up cheap scares for the sake of being scary. The way the story evolves really helps us get to understand the young crew from Derry, Maine, who cross paths with the demonic clown (played by Bill Skarsgard). We get to see the rapport between the friends, who bond through experiences with being bullied, trying to enjoy their summer and coping with disappearances of their peers without explanation. Of course, once everyone begins to understand what's happening, thanks to run ins with Pennywise and strain visions, their bond becomes stronger and is put to the test.A reason why 'It' succeeds is because it is pretty evenly balanced. It's a dramatic horror film rather than a generic, standard horror film. There are some scenes that are actually pretty funny due to the fact that the main stars are all adolescents - it would be odd if the film took itself too seriously. It's also not dry or boring. As a result of the pacing, there is enough taking place onscreen to keep the audience engaged. From an acting standpoint, it's hard to overlook the performance Skarsgard gives. He brings out the cheeky yet sinister demeanor in a way that you'd expect a pro like Jim Carrey to be able to do, and his presence (or implied presence) is the main driver of events in the film. Specifically, the opening scene is something that sets the tone for the rest of the film - and will stay with you for days after watching it.Again, 'It' is not just about a killer clown - it's about friendship, acceptance, young love and many other things. 'It' should be appreciated for the way these concepts are captured in an otherwise terrifying story.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
***New Age Clown Horror Flick of Stephen Kings all time Classic Novel ***,"This has to be hands down this years creepiest going to be (ALREADY) a classic flick !!!. The first encounter with Pennywise (Bill Skasgard) itself gives you a strong,tense and dark sensation where the remaining movie is going .The small details being so clear seems like we have put into a world of Clown fear and mystery of all the children that are going missing under chaotic circumstances .Creepiness at it utter most Bill Skasgard delivers an excellent ,astonishing performance as Pennywise the shape- shifting Children eating Clown of Derry,Maine. Maybe even as iconic as Tim curry who did appear as the same character in the previous IT MINI SERIES(1990). His sinister face with that large forehead , child like face, tight old clown outfit and weirdest set of eyes making it almost the weirdest character ever done. Its going to be a haunted memory as that's all i can say .Jump scares 9/10 gives you the chills and the story ,the atmosphere damn and how it immerses the audience into this small town and the mysteries of it is amazing .Lots of GORE AND BLOOD making it an R rated Package for a spooky ride . King itself being impressed with the movie Andy Muschietti taking a huge risk of a remake has done a great work pulling together this greatly awaited trauma filled movie .Cast is excellent .8/10 Makeup too good 8.8/10 .Totally Everyone one has done a good job .Great Angles giving it a vintage touch, CGI has gone to a new level where we are put deep down into penny-wises tricks and gory kinda funny acts.To say if it has done justice to the book or not .. you can say it has and it hasn't .its like 60/40. Some scenes have been made different but its good as far i see it. Leaving this treat be, the climax as not in the book due to some reasons says king fits with the time line and giving it a small gap through for the second part which is dated to release in 2019 .Overall Great flick i would recommend everybody to watch it from the theater itself .

Utterly disappointing,"I felt obligated to write a review, due to not just a slight difference between the movie rating and the actual experience our whole theater room was having. It really felt like cheap and intimidatingly boring movie that can not be compared to any good horror film. Me and my group of friends were really close to actually leaving the room, there was constant laugh about the predictability and cliché moments. The whole time was happening so much but still nothing actually happened. And I wouldn't call it scary but disgusting. There was no actual built tension but just one big WTF. The kids were fun at some moments of the movie, and the story definitely has a good ground but it was terribly adapted into the movie. I cant remember the movie thag annoyed me as at this one even though I consider myself patient and open about different kinds of movies.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Nothing says ""strong together"" like killing a killer clown","I am a bit annoyed about the little sunshine features of political questions, I understand the basic underdog concept in a horror story, but somehow I feel that the 1990's pic was far more of a horror film. I think I experted a modern form of art film, a bit more avant gardy. It's funny how people demand realism in an unrealistic plot. Of course, Stephen King is widely known for his realistic dynamics especially with young characters, but that put aside, I expected more of an experimental flick. There is an annoying blockbuster feeling about this. And regarding the fact that Skarsgård did a tremendous job visualizing the clown, I felt like the children where presented like superheros in a way, and that is probably what makes med think of the politics. I don't want to see superheroes against the clown; I want to see broken kids with broken souls from broken homes and broken world views get physically dragged into the concept of challenging Pennywise.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

An excellent horror movie that tried to sprinkle in too much comedy,"This movie is excellent, plain and simple. Bill Skarsgard is absolutely phenomenal as Pennywise the Clown in what I believe to be one of his best performances. The rest of the child cast are fantastic in their roles too with each bringing a different energy that ultimately meshed beautifully in a friend group at the center of the film. Firstly, I lean towards preferring the original IT film, but this remake is no slouch. The cinematography and setting are very good and added a ton to the film. By far my favorite about this film is the practical effects and CGI that are unequivocally the star of the film as it allowed an otherwise unsettling character in Pennywise to be able to transform into a truly demonic and haunting entity. I found myself continually loving every single time a big piece of CGI or practical effect happened and interested to see what they did next. My singular complaint about the film is the over addition of comedic elements and, while plenty of them were funny, they felt oddly out of place more often than well done. It ruined a couple of good scenes by trying to sneak a one liner in. The comedic issues dropped it from an 8 to a 7 for me. Regardless of those missteps, the film is one I would absolutely recommend everyone to watch at least once with undivided attention. And you will likely laugh at least a couple times.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Pennywise returns after a 27 year slumber. As a coming of age story with horror elements, It is very entertaining","Within the misty Northeast of Maine, rests a place called Derry, that seems like any other white- picket fence small town with a main street and a parade every forth of July. In the sewers, however, lies an evil that has appeared in many forms, but for the children that have encountered it, see him as Pennywise, the dancing clown. This is the description of one of the most famous Stephen King stories, It. Though the books goes into a lot of existential material on how the creatures comes from outside the universe, the story of a clown haunting a town has scared a generation a book readers. The material seemed almost like an urban legend.Many people were introduced to It through the 1990 miniseries that had Tim Curry as Pennywise. Split into two parts, it had some problems as while the parts set during the childhood was entertaining, the adult parts were underwhelming and unimpressive. It seemed that the strength of the story was about the children having to face their fears while they tried to defeat this evil clown. A movie would need extensive rewriting, but had potential. It brings Pennywise back after a twenty-seven year slumber, ready to haunt a new generationperhaps the old generation as well.On a rainy day in 1988, a young boy named Georgie is eaten by a figure in a storm sewer who introduces himself as Pennywise the dancing clown (played by Bill Skarsgård) Without a body, the adults of Derry, Maine simply report him missing, along with many other children that seem to disappear over the year. In June of 1989, the kids are out of school as they try to make the most of their summer. The overweight new kid on the block Ben tries to research the history of the town and the missing children, but has an encounter with Pennywise and a group of bullies lead by Henry Bowers.Beaten, his wounds are tended by stuttering Bill, big-mouthed Ritchie, Jewish bookworm Stan, hypochondriac Eddie, and outcast girl Beverly. The kids declare themselves ""The Losers Club"" as they have always sensed something wrong with the town, as each have encountered Pennywise in a form that strikes their fear. They come to understand that the clown is powerful and may have been around for hundreds of years. Understanding that the curse will continue, they make their way to the sewers to try and defeat Pennywise.I'll admit upfront that director Andy Muschieti understand that It is not a horror story, but rather a coming of age story with horror elements; think The Goonies meets Nightmare on Elm Street. For the most part, it really work as a whole. The movie does take its time to show how each kid grows up during that eventful summer. Fear is a boundary from adolescence to adulthood, and the writing shows that with a town as crazy as Derry, just why these losers needed to go through this experience.All the child actors are very likable in their part. Like The Goonies and The Sandlot, you get a sense that they must be friends in real life to reflect this kind of honest chemistry. There wasn't a moment where I dreaded having to follow one over the other; they were interesting enough that you want to see through their troubles. How about Pennywise? Bill Skarsguåd is simply terrifying and unnerving as the clown. I won't say if he's better then Tim Curry as the performance is different. Unlike the miniseries, this Pennywise is more childlike and unearthly. His design his fantastic and better draws from the fact he's been then for a while.Does this make It a masterpiece? Almost. There were moments that the humor and drama don't match the situations. The ones with Pennywise do, but its with the kids that's a tad harder. There are moments where after an attack or something bad happening, one of them (mostly Ritchie) will try to let off a joke or swear that just doesn't fit the situation. It's something that might have worked with more thought put into the dialogue. But other then that, this will probably be Stephen Kings most watched movie in a while.I'll give this nine red balloons out of ten. Despite an R rating, I'd say that this may be a good start for older children (I'll say twelve to be safe) that want to get into watching horror movies. It may even be an interesting family outing to talk about this, the book and everything the kids just went through. If you have a fear of clowns, brace yourself. It is a lot of things, including an entertaining movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
IT,"It is an American supernatural horror film from 2017, based on Stephen King's 1986 novel of the same name.

Pennywise, who can take shape according to the victims' fears, begins to scare these 7 children disguised as an eerie clown.

"Well done, Andy Muschietti and crew!","I almost never do reviews. This is my first time leaving a review on IMDb. I'm not going to get into too much detail about the film but I will say what I think needs to be said. I watched the 90's mini series about 7-8 times over the years, and I recently read the book! So I was definitely really excited for this film!IT wasn't perfect, but it was pretty darn good. You could pick it apart like some people have done and argue that maybe it was over CGI-ed, or one review I read said the plot was rushed, or maybe there was a tad too much humor. It was too magical or not ""true horror"". Not a lot like the novel. Bulls**t! It was good. Not perfect, but really good! Do I wish it were scarier and more violent with less CGI? Yeah. Would I have personally liked it better if it were identical to the novel? Sure, but I still enjoyed the film.The acting was very well done by all; Skarsgard does quite well with his own take of the sadistic clown! Some of the kids are actually quite funny and it works well I think. It's Decently scary (or perhaps really scary for some folks)! Some great surprises and jump-scares in there. It's quite disturbing, creepy, and funny! Also, amazing timing on the release of this film (27 years later).If you're a fan of horror, clowns, the TV mini series, the book, or Stephen King... check IT out!! 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

One of the best Stephen King adaptations in years!,"IT surprised me; it took a story that some consider unbelievably corny and updated it to have some genuine scares that aren't your clichéd jump-scare tropes in most modern horror movies. Pennywise is terrifying in this film and looks like he 'will f@cking eat you' if you're not careful enough, a far-cry from Tim Curry's well-meaning but too funny portrayal of the character. Bill Skarsgard's take on the notorious clown child-killer is one for the ages. If the other material of the story bothers you, you can probably forgive them thanks to Skarsgard's incredible Pennywise performance.I think the film analyzed King's clichés in the stories and added some needed depth to make them believable instead of being placeholders on the author's behalf. The bullies are the typical bullies but here they may actually kill you instead of spewing meaningless words, the kids here are interesting and they're individual in identity and don't share the same struggles as the other. The cast is wonderful and they compliment the story's original intent. This movie surprised me and it's sure to surprise you to.Stephen King may have suffered from The Dark Tower's under-performance, but IT forgives him and redeems him of that baggage beautifully.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""It"" is more than a horror movie - it's a great film","Note to the film makers out there who consider themselves horror aficionados... When you create a horror movie, start with the intent to make a great film.""It"" has a built-in cult following as many Stephen King adaptations do, but this film stands alone as the best Stephen King adaptation outside of ""Shawshank"". Why? The filmmakers do justice to several crucial elements to any good film:1. They focused on a true-to-life script that felt real for both the setting, the characters, and the villain.2. The acting, especially by the child actors who are the lifeblood of the film, was phenomenal.2A. Let me single out Bill Skarsgard here, playing Pennywise is no small task, it takes a wide range of emotions that play out each time we encounter It - on several occasions we see Pennywise elicit several emotions in a matter of seconds - he brings an unpredictability and sporadic physicality to the role that works INCREDIBLY well and really keeps you on your toes. You're engaged whenever he's on screen. Kudos to his voice and terrific evil clown laugh, there's so much to love about his performance which I feel may be understated - the makeup is so scary that it may get lost just how much Skarsgard is bringing it in every scene.3. The villain was the stylish, creepy, Pennywise - obviously the film needed this character to be near flawless to create a sense of impending doom at any moment... Success, Pennywise, even for those not afraid of clowns, puts most inter-dimensional pseudo-demonic villains to shame.The film works so well because character development was handled very carefully, we learn about each of our young protagonists along the way, and what we learn about them is continuously exposed by Pennywise in order to weaken their will.Without spoiling anything, this is a film about children being tormented by a demonic-clown, the very thought of children in danger can be unsettling, but ""It"" takes it to the next level - within the first 10 minutes of the film you will understand what you're in for, and you'll know right away that NO ONE, regardless of age or how you might feel about violence toward children, is safe.The other great thing about this film was cinematography coupled with special effects... honestly, and I did not expect this going in - but ""It"" is a visual spectacle - the set design, the scenery, the color-scheme, it's all beautifully (and sometimes terrifyingly) done.I could go on and on, this was a top notch horror film, plenty of jumps (if you're prone to that sort of thing), lots of spine tingling moments, and truly, nothing cheap - this film doesn't hold back. Beyond being a great horror film, it's a terrific coming of age tale, well written, well acted, well directed. I wouldn't be shocked if the film gets some surprise nods during awards season for cinematography, editing, sound, makeup and special effects, just my two cents.In summation: ""It"" is a dazzlingly terrifying spectacle that will stun you with every punch it doesn't pull. It goes beyond being one of the best horror movies of the past few decades, ""It"" is simply a tremendous film.Horror movies - take note, THIS is how it's done.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not so much a scary movie, but more of suspense and interesting scenes.","To clarify, I haven't read the book and I haven't seen the original movie from years ago. So I entered this movie with an open mind and ready to see what it was like.Starting with the positive points; it has good scenes, interesting and creative, with excellent dynamics among the actors who are able to present the natural qualities of children their age, some are funny, others are shy, others worry a lot, and others are just annoying. Which is good, giving an excellent touch of fluidity and tangibility to the characters. Cinematography does a good job of building the scene, showing each of the environments and creating fascinating locations for each shot that occurs and creating good tension for the viewer. As another review of the film said very well, It feels at times, like a collection of scenes rather than a complete horror movie. The movie entertains, although its construction is very, very slow. With two hours of duration, it's not until halfway through the movie that things get tense, and when they get tense, they don't get so tense.This is where I think the movie fails. It's not scary, really not. Despite having good actors and special effects, the film completely destroys the sense of fear by giving a strange combination of gore and comedy; presenting itself more like a grotesque play than a disturbing one. And oh god, it makes a lot of use of jumpscares, which is perfect for stressing, but not entertaining. In itself, the movie lacks a truly frightening atmosphere, and feels more like an adventure movie than a horror movie, failing quite a bit there.In short, it's an entertaining, decent movie, but I don't consider it a good horror movie. It's probably good for young people who want to be introduced to the genre, but after that, it's more of an adventure comedy.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

young adult horror identitycrisis,"After revisiting this movie for what I think is the third Or fourth time I started to be a bit more critical of it. I still think this is a good movie but it doesn't land all the things it tries to do.We follow the losers club, a group of outcast kids who most uncover how to defeat the evil entety they call It aka pennywise the dancing clown.Bill Skarsgård gives a great preformance as pennywise and I would kinda love to see him have more screentime. At the same time that might hurt the chatecter and take away even more time from the losers club.The losers club has some issues to me. Overall the kids preformances are great but some of them is simply not given a charecter in this movie. While Bill and Beverly are fleshed out charecters, Mike and especially Stanley are given nothing in this movie. They might as well not be in the movie but the source material demands it.The scares in this movie were not very affective to me and seems more like disturbing images you would find in a YouTube video. This however makes this movie a good ""kids first horror movie"" contender. The few times the movie got me were suttle things in the background rather than the actually scares I was suppose to react to.There is some amazing shots in this movie and the camera work is overall really well done. The score is also really good. It shifts between happy and horror really seemless.The movie also has an identitycrisis sometimes with wierd music choises and jokes. The movie doesn't really have a consistent tone and the shift between young adult, comedy and horror is not woven together perfectly.While I find the movie good I noticed all the small things that bugged me way more this time.

Movie of the year!,"Saw this movie yesterday, and more than 24 hours later, I'm still blown away.

When it needs to scare you, it'll make you look for a bed to dive under.The kids are a wonder on their own. They fit together as nothing we've seen since ""Stand By Me"" or ""The Goonies"".

The dialogues between the Loser's Club will get you by your heart, right into the first 15 minutes of screening.

This is a HEAVY movie when it comes to the mature parts. When you're felling too light, the movie comes down and crush you with a moment so intense, it'll make you doubt they even had the guts to put that on screen.We have a masterpiece being made right in front of our eyes.

IT Finally Reaches The Big Screen,"What I enjoyed most about this was its willingness to make itself different from the TV miniseries which it takes some inspiration from. While Pennywise is less penetrating surreal in his mixture of innocent comedy with macabre themes, creating a disturbing duality that mixes a sense of adulthood with childhood like in Tim Curry's outing, here Pennywise is more obsessed with imitating the behavior of children, only to switch and turn into his predatory alien nature when the opportunity arises. The R rating does this film more favors than its typical scares, which are plentiful but rarely effective. Often times the ""horror"" equates to yelling at the screen, or creatures hissing, but sometimes it does something clever and catches you off guard. An improvement in some ways, but it is missing that childhood sheen, as the film puts a grimy and ruddy filter over everything.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

But it appears that filming only completed in September of last year, so that appears not to be the case.The film starts memorably and brutally with the ""drain scene"" from the trailer. And very effective it is too. ""Great!"" you think this is a spookfest that has legs! Unfortunately, for me at least, it all went downhill from there. The film really doesn't seem to know WHAT it's trying to be. There are elements of ""Stand By Me""; elements of ""Alien""; elements of ""The Conjuring"", all thrown into a cinematic blender and pulsed well.The most endearing aspects of the movie are the interactions of the small-town kids, with this aspect of the film bearing the closest relationship to J.J. Abrams' ""Super 8"". This is carried by the great performances of the young actors involved, with Jaeden Lieberher (so memorable in ""Midnight Special"") as Bill; Jeremy Ray Taylor (""Ant Man"") as Ben ('the chubby one'); and Finn Wolfhard, in his big-screen premiere and sporting an absurd set of glasses, as the wise-cracking Ritchie.Standout for my though was the then 14-year old Sophia Lillis as Beverly (the nearest equivalent to the Elle Fanning role in ""Super 8""). This young lady has SUCH screen presence, reminiscent of Emma Watson in the Harry Potter films. I think she is a name to watch!While commenting on the acting I do need to acknowledge Bill Skarsgård (""Atomic Blonde"" and son of Stellan Skarsgård) who is creepily effective as Pennywise the clown.Having a film that just centred on the pubescent interplay between the youngsters and their battles against the near-psychopathic school bully Bowers (Nicholas Hamilton, ""Captain Fantastic"") would have kept me well-entertained for two hours. However, in the same way that the hugely over-inflated Sci-Fi ending of ""Super 8"" rather detracted from that film, so the clown-related story popping up all the time just irritated me to distraction. (""WILL YOU JUST FECK OFF AND LEAVE US TO FIND OUT WHO BEVERLY GETS OFF WITH???!!"")While the film has a number of good jump-scares, a lot of them – especially those with excessive use of CGI – just don't really work. There are normally no ""outcomes"" from the scares. It's all a bit like a ghost train where the carriage rounds a corner, something jumps out, and then the carriage moves on round the corner again! What makes a great horror film is where the ""science"" of the horror is well thought through. ""Alien"" was an exceptional example of that, where the science wasn't just ""physics"" but also ""biology"". Here (and I'm not sure whether this is true to the book this is one of Stephen King's I haven't read) there seems to be no rules involved at all. Things happen fairly randomly: shape-shifting and effects on physical objects happen with no rational explanation; the kids can see things adults can't see. (Why?). In fact the ""adults"" – the usual mix of Stephen King dysfunctional small-town crazies – seem to have no significant part in the story at all. It's all like some lame teenage fantasy where actions (a number of individuals in the story meet their demise) seem to carry no legal consequences whatsoever. I half expected Bill to wake up – Dallas style – at the end and realise it had all been an ""awful dream""!In particular, the denouement is highly dissatisfying. An opportunity for a (very black) twist in the plot is discarded.  Pennywise the clowns departure is both lame and unconvincing. And there are numerous loose ends that are never properly tied down (what was that ""floaters descending"" dialogue about?. it was just never followed through!).It's not all bad though. The location shoots in Bangor, Maine and the Ontario countryside are all beautifully rendered by cinematographer Chung-hoon Chung  (""Stoker"") and where the film clicks with the young cast it clicks well and enjoyably. I just wish that the overall film wasn't just such a jumbled-up mess: blame for that must lie with the screen writing team and director Andy Muschietti (""Mama""). I'm going to give it a kicking in my rating, since with all the marketing build-up it was certainly a disappointment. I see though that at the time of writing that this film sports an unfathomably high IMDb rating of 8.0/10 so I'll acknowledge that somebody must have seen something more in this than I did!!(For the full graphical review, please visit bob-the-movie-man.com).",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Nothing like a little fear to make a paper man crumble.""","Is ""It"" 'very scary'; 'quite scary' or 'not very scary at all'? Well, I would settle on the film being 'pretty bloody scary indeed', if you don't mind(!) Director Andy Muschietti's adaptation of a Stephen King novel, yet to have been given a proper cinematic adaptation to now, is the sort of horror film I find myself being able to get into: rounded protagonists; interesting villains; a real sense of good and evil at play; some genuinely chilling moments and no real reliance on violence to propel the sense you've seen something substantial.The film depicts the exploits of a group of American children in a small fictitious town in the state of Maine during one, long summer holiday in 1989, wherein they dodge bullies; disagreeable parents and a series of odd visions which play on their barest fears. The film opens with a ghostly rendition of the age-old nursery rhyme ""Oranges and Lemons"" which, I think, is designed to call to mind Orwell's ""1984"" wherein it was used as a sort of diegetic overture to the book's depiction of oppression and censorship. Said novel was, of course, about a set of characters living under the yoke of a seemingly unconquerable terror - the likes of which seemed to know your every move and, later on, your inner-most fear...""It"" essentially covers the tale of Billy (Jaeden Lieberher), a gawky looking kid with a stammer and a thin build - think DJ Qualls when he was much younger. During the film's preface, set eight months before the rest of the picture, Billy loses his younger brother on a stormy night when a model boat they build is washed away down their street and into the sewer. There, at the grate, he meets the titular ""It"" - what appears to be a smooth talking clown with a lazy eye and a devilish grin... Suffice to say, Billy's younger brother doesn't make it home.Declared missing, and making it his mission to find him having felt responsible for sending him out in the storm, the audience, and not Billy, is playfully allowed to know what awaits those who don't let sleeping dogs lie. The film unfolds in such a way that we learn about dozens, even hundreds of other kids who have gone missing over the centuries in the same town and we realise, chillingly, what we saw in the opening has, in some guise, occurred many-a time before. Consequently, we might feel as if we have seen more than perhaps has been shown.Billy, having been told in no uncertain terms to move on by his parents, has a group of friends who are, mostly, with him all the way. What is refreshing about the approach here is that a group of people effectively act as the protagonists - all are victims to the monster's stalking and we are spared a lone, increasingly neurotic, lead wading through on their own.The kids themselves are a pleasingly distinctive bunch: one is a little too sexually aware, but has some wonderfully funny lines; another is crippled by a series of allergies. Beverly (Sophia Lillis) is a red-headed girl with an abusive father, Ben happens to possess a deep understanding of the town having just moved there and had nothing to do but frequent a library. As the film whips along, one does not become lost amidst a sea of supporting acts. Some of the boys' feelings for Beverly, perennially with a key hung around her neck inferring only she can unlock something somewhere, are smoothly mixed into the narrative.Another easy card the film avoids playing lies in what it considers frightening, both within the confines of the film for the characters and for us, the audience. Muschietti avoids going down a route of throwing things at the screen such as snakes and spiders, or rats, in order to get across the scares. Each of the characters has their own particular fear. Afraid of germs? Then you'll have a leper chase you down the street. Just cut off your hair over the sink because you're scared of attracting unwanted sexual attention? It'll come back up the plug and wrap itself around you. Not fond of the rendition of a particular image in a painting? Chances are it'll stalk you through the corridors of your own home.These things don't sound especially frightening by themselves, but it is remarkable, for instance, just how creepy your standard zombie-like creature becomes when it's presented within this context. As for the silly oil painting of the old lady playing a flute which we didn't think was especially frightening when we first saw it - well, we don't think the same by the end...There is even a moment towards the end of the film whereby ""It"" suddenly seems to morph its legs to form a kind of arachnid creature in a desperate attempt to frighten the characters because, I think, it is assuming that everybody has some sort of rooted fear of insects or whatnot. This sense of reverting to something at a time of desperation in order to win is noticeable and seems to be the director's way of putting it to other film-makers that throwing things at the screen for sake of it just doesn't work. What does work, however, is part one of this double-header - a pretty outstanding horror feature on its own and well worth checking out if you are a fan of the genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

A instant classic to be possibly seen as a classic in the future.,"A beatifully shot film with a fantastic cast that makes a film about a shapeshifting clown seem possible.

A love letter to the Stephen King oeuvre and an unforgettable and magical cinematic experience,"The hype is a killer, but this movie knocked out of the park nevertheless. People who are saying that this film is not scary have no idea what they are talking about or must be too used to the usual tropes of horror movies of late. This is one of the most unrelenting, upsetting and nastiest (in a good way) children centered movies to ever make it to the big screen. This is HARDCORE Stephen King, with a memorable villain at its center (mesmerizing Bill Skarsgard performance) and a group of kids fighting demons (supernatural and the others) and grappling to figure out the inner workings of social life, learning about solidarity, facing the ugly facts of life and even becoming murderous under certain circumstances, while adults remain scary caricatures in the best Roal Dahl tradition. In more that one way, this is the definitive thesis in fear. You meet the characters through those specific things that they dread the most, and all these fears form a rosary that starts swirling around this enigmatic figure of a deranged clown who ""feasts on their flesh and feeds on their fear"". Director Andres Muschietti does such a sterling work in highlighting the best of Stephen King prose here that is surely going to bring a tear to the eye of the most devote readers. He takes licenses too, and even make bold choices like the use of the 80's soundtrack which I found exhilarating at times, or the source of blissful release in moments when the dread sank too heavy upon my chest. This is a visceral experience that must be experienced on the big screen but be prepared to have your senses assaulted!. I was riveted, and only at the beginning of the 3rd act the film's momentum seemed to wane slightly, but by the time the character of Beverly wakes up the movie grabbed me again by the throat. Muschietti conjures some seriously unsettling imagery helped by a cgi has an abstract quality to it, like the over-sized Pennywise in one hell of a scene that got the whole audience gasping, or a Modigliani painting come to life; the musical score is also brilliant, as it is the sound design. I feel this movie will be a landmark, for sure is going to be embraced by a new generation and I cannot wait to see the next installment.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Terrifying Return to Derry,"IT is a compelling adaptation that successfully captures the haunting essence of Stephen King's classic novel. Directed by Andy Muschietti, the film immerses viewers in the dark and unsettling world of Derry, Maine, where childhood fears take terrifying forms. While not flawless, it delivers an effective blend of horror, nostalgia, and heartfelt storytelling that resonates with both fans of the novel and general audiences.Bill Skarsgård's portrayal of Pennywise the Dancing Clown is a standout element of the film. Skarsgård brings a chilling and otherworldly presence to the role, blending sinister playfulness with deeply unsettling menace. His unsettling mannerisms, eerie voice, and haunting expressions make this iteration of Pennywise unforgettable and uniquely distinct, cementing his place as one of King's most memorable cinematic creations.The young cast playing the Losers' Club is equally noteworthy. Their natural chemistry and authentic performances create a believable and engaging portrayal of friendship, courage, and vulnerability. Each character feels distinct, yet their bond is the emotional core of the story, adding weight to the film's more intense and horrific moments. Themes of friendship and overcoming personal fears are interwoven seamlessly, offering depth and relatability amidst the scares.Visually, IT excels with its atmospheric cinematography, effective set design, and a score that heightens tension throughout. The eerie landscapes of Derry and the creepy design of Pennywise's lair contribute to a sense of dread and unease. The special effects are well-crafted, creating moments that are both visually arresting and horrifying.However, the film isn't without its shortcomings. At times, it leans too heavily on conventional jump scares rather than building the slow, creeping tension that fans of psychological horror might crave. Additionally, condensing the sprawling, layered narrative of King's novel into a single film (or even two) means that some of the book's deeper themes and nuances are inevitably lost.In conclusion, IT is a solid and engaging adaptation that honours the spirit of Stephen King's novel while offering its own unique take. Thanks to Skarsgård's chilling Pennywise, the well-cast Losers' Club, and its atmospheric visuals, the film delivers a memorable horror experience. While it doesn't fully capture the intricacy of the source material, it remains a worthy and enjoyable interpretation that balances scares with heartfelt storytelling.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

A computer generated abomination ofa film,I hated this film after the opening scene. The actor who portrays It is great but Hollywood needs everything done on powerpoint so it ages like crap. Why use a great actor when we can create a clown with CG and take away any possibility of It being scary. This decision alone destroyed the film.I also think a horror film that doesn't manage to be scary is a complete failure. It's like a comedic movie that isn't funny.,1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not that great as expected,"Too much use of the CG kind of ruined the movie for me , to be more specific , the CG in the opening scene with the sewer and everything . The movie is not scary unless you are not used to watch horror movies or you are younger than 15 years old . Anyway , most of the jumpscares were shown in the trailer of the movie so it's not much of a surprise in the movie . They didn't add a lot of parts from the book into the movie and i didn't really liked that either . 
Now , the acting of the kids is good , but i really liked Bill's acting . He was giving a more creepy vibe to pennywise than Tim did . Actually , he was giving another vibe to the clown , more exactly . 
I would rather recommend the original movie to someone than this one . This one is not as good as people hoped it would be . And again , that abuse of CG is scratching my Brain",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Imagine a very good episode of Goosebumps, throw in good child acting, Conjuring-styled suspense, buckets of blood and a focused unrelenting villain","It is directed by Andy Muschietti and it is a remake of the 1990 three- hour miniseries which in turn was based on Stephen King's own 1986 horror novel. So what is ""It?"" As a kid browsing through video rental stores in 90's, I have always noticed the peculiar VHS cover with a white face painted, sinister looking clown on it with the title ""It"" in bold red colors. The miniseries was hailed by classmates at school to be the scariest movie of all-time and I always wondered why; the back of the VHS seemed to show the scariest thing about the film is just a killer clown. Is it because I am fortunately enough to not have a phobia of clowns that is why it had no effect on me? Then I thought about why Stephen King chose to name the book ""It"" and not ""Clown"" if it is indeed just a story about a killer clown. This 20-something year old question of mine was finally answered when I saw this 2017 iteration at the cinema on opening day. It is whatever you do not want it to be. It manifests itself as the thing you fear most. In short, it is an entity that can transform and show itself as your worst nightmare. Now that my curiosity is finally answered, is the movie any good? Well, bloody yes.It as a film in general succeeds on all facets. It was creepy, scary, funny, heartfelt and emotional. Imagine a very good episode of Goosebumps, throw in good child acting, Conjuring-styled suspense, buckets of blood and a focused unrelenting villain – the results of this beautiful concoction would be It. It could have easily been a mess of a movie, been accused of copying latest horror trends of James Wan or Eli Roth, but Andy Muschietti was able to hone everything down neatly into a spectacular package. Right from the get-go, we were able to see how beautiful the cinematography is; the basement, things lurking in the shadows, rainfalls, glowing eyes, etc. Visually, this is a gorgeously shot movie. The buildups of scares are very reminiscent of modern ghost films, but that is a good thing because they are done right with good payoffs, usually a nightmare-inducing image that sent chills down the audience's spines. I am not the kind of snotty movie goer who despises jump scares because I feel they are cheap and unearned, no I actually believe they are a vital ingredient in a horror movie and without them, even the sharpest film tends to dull out. Jump scares need to be well-timed and be used to unleash the tension at the climax of a scary scene, and It understand this very well.On one hand we have a hardcore horror film that mixes the best of both worlds of scares and violence, and on the other we have a retro old- school, band of misfits, kids adventure. This film proves you can have terrifying scares and at the same time not sacrifice well-developed characters. These protagonists are not cannon fodders who merely exist in the script to bite the dust, instead they are well fleshed-out human beings with their own problems and motivations. Bill loses his brother Georgie early on and is eager and impatient to find out what happened to him. Ben is the overweight perpetual new kid in school who is smart but has trouble making friends so he stays in the library. Beverly suffers from sexual abuse from her father at home. Individually each child actor brings it in this adaptation, they were all likable and funny, but together the Losers form a chemistry so good you would feel distraught if anything were to happen to even one of them.Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise gives one of the best villain performances I have ever seen. I would put this Pennywise up there with recent cinematic antagonists such as Hans Landa, Calvin Candie and Heath Ledger's Joker. Skarsgard's body movements, facial twitches and speech patterns were all unsettlingly creepy but at the same time still magnetic to watch. To expand upon my initial question on what is exactly is It: Pennywise the Dancing Clown is just one of the many of forms It the entity takes in the novel, but Tim Curry's performance in the miniseries popularized this particular form, so to most people It is synonymous with Pennywise, thus it makes sense for this remake to keep him as the main face.Perhaps the one thing that really made It so amazing to me is despite the villain is relentless and the protagonists are just kids, seemingly insurmountable for the Losers to defeat him, Pennywise has a clear weakness and without spoiling anything, he could be defeated. It is so refreshing to watch a horror movie of this kind where the supernatural villain is not a ghost or a demon that cannot be hurt and always wins in the end, but is someone who could lose if the protagonists work together and outsmart him in a meaningful way. This gives hope and creates a sense of earnestness and sincerity to the picture, where the underdogs can eventually overcome the adversary if they do not give up.Overall It is probably my favorite recent horror movie, and as a film on a technical perspective, it is probably the best ever. The scares worked, it looked great, and the characters and acting was amazing especially by Bill Skarsgard. I love the whole authentic 80's feel, it added a lot to the whole thing. I do not know what more I can ask for in a film in general, because It is easily one of 2017's best.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

A disappointment,"I loathe remakes, but this was one of the handful of remakes that I was actually hoping would be made someday. The source novel is as scary as it gets, but the original film, while it was a commendable effort, failed to deliver on most aspects.This adaptation delivers as far as the visual effects and technology goes, but fails otherwise. (Actually this sentence applies to 99 percent of the stuff made in the last 15 years). They were apparently so intent on how to show this scary face, of how to light that pit scene, that they forgot to care about the overall result.Don't get me wrong, the movie looks terrific, beyond terrific in fact, that's undeniable. The visuals are stunning even for today's audience, who are very hard to stun. Pennywise looks much better than Tim Curry's version (but still not as scary as him) and the acting is better than you'd expect. But after a nice start, the movie quickly becomes a ""when's the next jump scare coming"" fest. It's almost not like a movie, but simply a series of well-made scenes, brought together.It's not a bad movie, but it's average and for a King adaptation, that means disappointment, considering what it could have been. It could have been a classic that has a place among everyone's top horror lists. Instead, it's an average horror movie with effects that are among everyone's top horror lists.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Loved every minute of it,"To start off my review I'd like everyone to know I'm a huge Stephen King fan. I love every Stephen King book I've ever read and there is NOTHING quite like an excellent Stephen King film adaptation and this is one of those great film adaptations. What I love so much about IT is that it's a horror film while remaining a comedy and while still focusing on the bigger story line. IT was never a story about a killer clown, but a bunch of kids who banded together for a huge adventure. I loved that the movie gave the audience some excellent scares while still remaining authentic to the comedy of the book. In my opinion the highlight of this film was the banter between the kids and the perfect delivery of one liners by Finn Wolfhard. That kid seriously stole the show. I also liked that there were some moments that felt a little campy and some truly horrifying moments because it made the movie feel more realistic.

It is now my favorite movie,"I was super excited when I saw the first teaser for this film and was not disappointed when I went to go see it for the first time. The movie is creepy and a bit disturbing, but not ultra scary, and it really doesn't need to be super scary to be a great movie. There's lots of hilarious dialogue mostly by Eddie and Richie throughout the movie and interesting things going on to keep the movie from getting dull. Bill Skarsgård did a great job playing Pennywise and gave him some creepy features (Its creepy smile, the way its eyes move, the way it talks) that make Bills Pennywise different from Tim Curry's. It does a good job of getting the main theme (Facing your fears) throughout the movie, and as the Losers Club gets less afraid of Pennywise, so do you. I loved all of the kids performances in the movie, especially from Finn Wolfhard (Richie Tozier) and Jack Dylan Grazer(Eddie Kaspbrak). Andy Muschietti did a very good job at directing the movie, and I could not be more pleased with the way it turned out. The movie also has a great OST by Benjamin Wallfisch that sets a gloomy and tense mood. This has become my favorite movie of all time and I cannot recommend IT enough.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A diabolically unlaughable clown,"When children of all ages begin to disappear mysteriously in the small and the acerbic town of Derry, a clan of little boys, self- recognized under the pseudonym of The Losers' Club, will have to face their biggest and most remote fears, coming in the form of saffron hair, creepy nose, accused forehead, manipulative eyes and puffy balloons with great amounts of terror. Now, say hello to Pennywise!After Will Poulter dropped out, Bill Skarsgård was the one who seized with propriety and promptness of the star antagonistic role. His Pennywise is rogue, disturbing and dreadful, however, having to keep solid his function of film adaptation, the character relegates his duty to produce fear in order to have a preference for a more fantastic vision, utopias that seriously impair the impact it must have in the genre. Most of the jump-scares coming from Bob Gray are discredited by the perceptible and even crappy CGI saturation, however, ingenuity and originality in the introduction of each of his appearances is laudable and is one of the most remarkable and spooky facts as far as horror is concerned. It's disappointing to testify that despite his performance full of strength and magnetism, he never managed to reach the levels of glory of the opening sequence; Vocal and gestural nuances are impressive and the variations of color tonality in the eyes are to symbolize his persuasive purposes, strengthening and simultaneously portraying the ecstatic and the legendary scene in the sewer, simply a horror classic moment.After the abrupt and disquieting Cary Fukunaga departure, Argentinean Andy Muschietti, one of the greatest exponents representing the Latin American potential within the mecca of cinema, is put behind the cameras impregnating his hoarding touch for horror in every frame, marks revealed by impressive Hollywood debut ""Mama"". It has to be recognized that Muschietti fathoms the ways to conceive and play with the camera in order to set up an in crescendo atmosphere, Besides having a critical eye to conceive beautiful visuals and moving characters, however, the filmmaker loses control of the film at the instant that sets aside the importance and coherence of the story by cheap and ephemeral scares. It's also worth highlighting a homogeneous mixture of genres and original tension sequences, having the ability to revolutionize the ablatives of the audience in the twinkling of an eye. In addition to being the greatest pillar for the movie, he proudly exhibits clear references to today's horror film; to name just one: ""The Conjuring"" universe, with the use of infinite horror tricks, in fact, one scene and one character resemble some particulars of the third installment of Wan's world. Yet in spite of the above, it presents great scope flaws as inconsistencies in the script or perceptive licenses in the editing room that takes seriousness and credibility out, namely raccord failures.The under-age actors are, far and away, a mass appeal for the plot, their performances are sparkling and touching in the formation of the audience-characters fundamental link. While the infants will always be much more likely to create a true connection, the young septet achieves a relatively high-performing level, however, many of them do it with sadly stereotyped characters as Finn Wolfhard's big-mouthed comic relief (Richie Tozier), Jeremy Ray Taylor's loving and credulous paunchy (Ben Hanscom) and Chosen Jacobs' tormented boy (Mike Hanlon). But the tradition is broken with tremendously novel characters and zero clichés as the tough-minded and human protagonist Jaeden Lieberher (Bill Denbrough), the incredibly Jewish Wyatt Oleff (Stanley Uris) and, of course, Sophia Lillis' subversive and bad-ass role (Beverly Marsh), who is certainly one of the most fascinating female juvenile performances in recent horror.Written by Chase Palmer, Cary Fukunaga and Gary Dauberman, of course, on Stephen King's legendary pedestal, the story and script are below average in general terms. They choose to focus attention explicitly on the meetings between the members of the club and the Dancing Clown, giving sub-plots of dramatic weight to the supporting characters, in addition, the self-same main character doesn't get a short mention about his mother and father, it merely presents the moral and emotional conflict with his traumas, comrades and his little brother. A diligent approach to the problem of Bullying and social marginalization becomes apparent, which are accompanied by others that have long been among us, such as child abuse, maternal over-protection, puberty and overcoming from the most terrifying fear to the most harmless; in short, dramatic genre stands out totally. However, the most serious flaw, which is noticeable from the middle of the footage, is heightened in the third act, spilling pure fantasy/fiction that snatches horror category away, alternating situations that clearly come from the wonderful mind of King.Andy Muschietti doesn't disappoint, but sadly he doesn't overwhelm us. His remake/revival of Pennywise tale, which will come in only two installment, provides sufficient amount of fidelity in the visual field, however, the movie clearly fails to show its narrative aspects and horror tools, which fall apart, gradually, because of the sudden ton of fantasy that stifles the last act. For habitual audiences, ""It"" (2017) will endure breaking records thanks to an efficient marketing campaign, global childhood nostalgia, the sincere literary followers, the great doses of suspense and traditional jump-scares, however, for the most draconian and true lovers of the genre and the works of the author, the film doesn't really explore new horizons, besides, suffers from a lack of true horror nuance, slighting it by drama and suspense experiences that leave us a sense of nonconformity and even sadness when we see rolling down the closing credits, due to the abrupt ending of the story that does not have the same horror dimensions as the acts of its evil villain.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
this movie was great!!!,This movie was great with a lot of different scares not only from the clown. The cgi was overall good but at times it could look overdone. The casting was great with very likable kids and a very good played clown. It was very nice seeing that this movie came out about 27 years later from the old movie series.They should not have spoiled so much in the trailers because if saw all the trailers you would what would happen in certain scenes. But overall very enjoyable,10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Modern Day Classic,"I had been watching updates over the past year on the evolution and development of this new version of Stephen King's IT. I had seen the Tim Curry version in 1990 and though I thoroughly enjoyed it, IT just does not stand up today and is quite cheesy by today standards. I was very nervous about how this 2017 version would be handled. Thankfully my worries were quickly washed away. Andy Muschietti delivers a film that just plows through the material at a breakneck pace, in a good way. He keeps the tension high but also delivers some real humor thanks in part to Richie Tozier, (Finn Wolfhard in a polar opposite role from his Stranger Things character) . I would not call this a horror movie though, more of a supernatural thriller. I recall Joe Hill calling IT one of the 5 scariest movies ever, which is certainly not the case, but what IT lacks in pure horror, IT more than makes up for which tension and atmosphere, Though the projector scene is certainly jump worthy. The kids that make up The Losers Club all do an awesome job and you can feel their camaraderie right from the start. Though I do wish Mike's character had received a little more depth, hopefully they do this in Chapter 2, and all indications are that they will. I am hoping that the blu ray release will extend the film a little, in fact I would dearly love a ""Lord Of The Rings"" type of extended cut for the film and IT's subsequent Chapter(s), as the novel is almost 1200 pages. IT has broken records left right and center and for good reason. This is an excellent film, yes with it's faults for sure, but the good WAY out weighs the bad here. With a running time of 135 minutes, IT literally felt to be about 90, great movies can do that. I am waiting with baited breath to see how Chapter 2 deals with the adult versions of the Losers 27 years later.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Why?,"I've never took time out of my non-busy schedule to write a review, but I have to write one for IT. (Laughing) When I tell you guys that I forgot what IT was, I'm not kidding you. I was honestly looking for Barb because I thought the kids were in the upside down aka I thought I was watching Stranger Things...in IMAX. I can't believe I fell for the hype (hides face in shame). I loved that this movie focused in on the kids and didn't go back and forth, but the original, which I vaguely remember, still beats this remake! I think the actors were great, the one kid looks like Ali, and I thought their banter was realistic and super funny; the whole theater was cracking up. If you have absolutely nothing else to do with your time, money, and/or you are depressed...check out Stranger Things...I'm sorry I mean IT.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

One of the best movies of 2017 and one of the best remakes ever.,"I was waiting for this movie for about a year and boy did it live up to my expectations. It was well produced had its scares and laughs. The Loser's Club (most importantly Finn Wolfhard as Richie and Jack Dylan Grazer as Eddie) gave heart to the film and made you care about the characters. Pennywise was simply creepy and the little details in this film made it really awesome, Bill Skarsgard was the perfect choice to play the dancing clown as he terrorized the kids and the audience watching the movie. The inclusion of funny scenes was clever from director Andy Muschietti as he had the audience in the palm of his hands so that when there is a scary scene they would have been calm due to the comedy in this movie.This is a must for horror fans and for fans of the book.

Hilarious - not a real Horror?,"First thing to declare is that I've never seen the original, though it is in my watch list!I thought I'd start reviewing this within my first 10 minutes of watching it. We meet Pennywise the Dancing Clown almost instantly, hiding down a sewer bidding a young boy over. Now because of this, the tension and almost entire aspect of horror felt non existent. You're more scared of what you can't see, that slow progression as to what the monster is.We then spend the next 30 minutes meeting our young characters, their bullies and local area - it's very clear they're the social outcasts. We also bump into Pennywise along the way, scaring different children in various fun ways. I would add I'm so far not impressed by the acting but the film seems adequate, if not slightly B gradey? Maybe I'm a little harsh.As the film progresses, the brother of the child whose gone missing and his friends continue a search to find him.I won't spoil the rest of the film, but I was pleasantly surprised? At the very least it was enjoyable, with some fun scenes of Pennywise scaring and chasing in his imaginative way. Overall, 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent scary story about a small town haunted by disappearances...,"1st watched 7/14/2018 :
Excellent scary story about a small town haunted by disappearances. The story begins with the disappearance of the young brother, Georgie, of the main character - Billy. Than, 1 by 1, we are introduced to the cast of outcast kids and their real-life fears. A scary clown, named Pennywise - is the reason for all the disappearances every 27 years, but - of course - only the group of outcast kids are revealed this - while the rest of the town ignore the issue. This movie works in a lot of ways - 1) As a scary movie, 2) As a story about facing your fears, and 3) a coming of age tale. There is no major stars in the film, but it is played out and directed almost flawlessly. It is all portrayed from the perspective of the kids - as the adults in the movie are mere window-dressing. Every child in the group that determines to confront the evil character has a backstory, and a reason for their fears except one who just fears clowns and we don't know why. As the kids each have strange visions they begin to come together sharing these stories. They determine the epicenter of the issue being a well, in town, which is now located in an old deserted house, and they visit it together to confront Pennywise. The ideas of togetherness and facing your fears is evident in the story, and these things become important to the conclusion of the movie. A must see horror/drama - being one of the better Stephen King interpretations brought to the screen.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Best Stephen King adaptation in years!,"In the second adaptation of the classic horror novel of the same name by Stephen King, IT is the best King adaptation we've had in years. What many of his recent works turned into films seem to be missing, is competency and heart. Director Andy Muschietti gives us both of that. IT is a clear love letter to the 1980s like STRANGER THINGS (Finn Wolfhard is even in both), and at its heart, it's not a horror film, but a sweet coming-of-age story, that would make the film better than it is, because let me tell you this: It's a horror movie with a creepy clown, but that's not what makes IT IT. It's really the coming-of-age drama, watching these characters grow and experience love, bullying, etc. Whenever the movie is just about the Losers Club swimming or fighting their bullies, the story is at its peak, but then Pennywise the Clown (Bill Skarsgard) shows up, and my entertainment is drowned, and now what I'm witnessing is loads of misery, that is still fun, but not as engaging because to be quite frank, I don't care much about horror.All the child actors in IT do a good job, but the performance everyone keeps coming back to is Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise, who is clearly very committed to the role, and thankfully not trying to imitate Tim Curry, but make a version of his own.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
They finally nailed it with a Stephen King adaptation,"When it comes to horror, Stephen King is regarded as being the master. Not everyone agrees with this, but there are very few people that would disagree that It knows which buttons to push. It is one of King's most recognizable works due to his play with coulrophobia, otherwise known as the fear of clowns. I've personally read some of the book and I've seen the 1990 version starring Tim Curry as Pennywise. This version had its pitfalls and unfortunately brushed over some details that would have helped it stand a bit stronger as a film adaptation. For these reasons, I was a bit reluctant to see yet another Hollywood remake for something that I wasn't sure even needed a remake in the first place. Let's take a closer, spoiler- free look at what this remake offers.The Good: All the kids played their characters extraordinarily well. Normally I'm not the biggest fan of children actors, in fact most of the time I'd prefer they not be in movies or shows. Nothing is worse than when you're in the moment of watching a good movie with a solid performance from the entire cast, then some little **** jumps in and yanks you out of it with terrible acting. For this I can say that I was impressed to see all the kids own their characters and behave like actual, non-acting kids. I was also curious to see how Finn Wolfhard of Stranger Things would follow up in It and he absolutely nailed it as Richie. He played the perfect little, wisecracking smartass that Richie is in the book which is a sharp contrast from his role in Stranger Things. Good things are on the horizon for him for sure, let's just hope he doesn't follow the road of other children actors, ahem Corey Feldman.The story ended up being vastly different than that of the 1990 version, which in my eyes is a good thing and is also kind of risky. I felt that the first film captured the spirit of the book a little better even if it wasn't perfectly executed. Overall though, I can understand why they made changes where they did. First being that the story is set in 1988/89 and the time lapse will bring us to 2016, allowing modern technologies to be a part of the story as well as making it generally more relevant to a younger audience. The key points were kept in place which made the minor changes along the way seem ultimately insignificant. The story still takes place in Derry, Pennywise is still Lord Commander of the sewers and the Barrens are The Loser Club's stomping grounds. If anything, some of the changes add motives to character's actions which I liked quite a bit (IE; Georgie's fate, which if you've read 10 pages of the book it's not really a big spoiler).As far as the horror element goes, I wouldn't really define this is being the scariest thing I've ever seen. They did a fantastic job with the atmosphere and making each scene uniquely creepy, but 90% of the scares are predictable. That's not a terrible thing because they didn't rely entirely on jump scares (although there are a few) and they focused more on building tension through the course of the film. There was also plenty of variety in the ways that Pennywise antagonized the kids, and I do love a creative villain.Speaking of which, I haven't forgotten Pennywise, the star of the show. The biggest concern most people (including myself) had was that the costuming and characterization of Pennywise came off as too menacing and therefore not in the original spirit of what Pennywise is in the books or the original film. Despite his gnarly makeup and fancy Victorian getup, he had a lot of qualities that made him friendly to naïve children but just creepy enough not to trust. I was not disappointed in what they did with Pennywise and I loved his interaction with the kids in the final confrontation.The Bad: I'm not one to nitpick too much at CGI since most movies have it now, but there were definitely a few moments that I felt weren't necessary to use it. It wasn't all terrible, but it was often used whenever Pennywise was around and there were some scenes that absolutely did not need it. Practical effects aren't always perfect so I'm not saying that it's the cure-all in this situation. The film seemed to rely very heavily on CGI and I'll be curious to see how this holds up down the road.As much as I like Richie, he's also probably the sole source of the R Rating. The writers tried to throw in as many F-bombs as possible and I'm not entirely convinced that it was necessary. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for a solid R rated movie, but that's a rarity in theaters now because most studios are afraid to lose money over it. For this reason, every instance of ""fuck"" in the movie felt somewhat forced just so that they could get the rating they wanted. Then again, most 13-year old boys usually don't know how to communicate outside of using expletives (and neither do I), so maybe it was the appropriate amount of usage and I'm just nitpicking.Check out the rest of this review and more at TheCynicist.com",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

It,"Every 27 years, the town of Derry experiences sudden, violent and inexplicable mayhem. In 1989, a group of school children rather unkindly called ""The Losers Club"" decide it is for them to investigate just what has happened. Led by ""Bill"" (Jaeden Martell) whose younger brother was a victim, these brave kids are soon on the trail of the shapeshifting ""Pennywise"" - a being from another dimension who frequently takes the shape of a clown. Question is - are these youngsters any match for this lethal and despicable foe? Andy Muschietti has done well here with this film. He manages to combine the more traditional spookiness of the old dark house, with a group of likeable characters who demonstrate the benefits of trust and teamwork as they take on this evil. As with most good horror films, the seemingly invincible must have a weakness, otherwise the plot becomes unsustainable - and this one allows the youngsters to define and exploit this whilst still maintaining enough shock moments and sense of menace to keep the thing interesting. The dialogue isn't the best, but that is not so important here - it's still a really well paced and genuinely scary story that engenders fear from something so outwardly benign as a clown - normally the symbol of joy and happiness. I rarely jump at the cinema nowadays, but this does work!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Sadly it is not very effective,"IT is an adaptation of Stephen King's 1986 horror novel of the same name. It is a story of a group of friends in a small town who are terrorized by the eponymous entity who is in the form of a clown and the subsequent attempt of the group to fight that being and uncover a mystery. Being a horror movie it has some good terrifying scenes and twist and turns but at the core it is a movie about friendship. While it is not exactly a Magnum Opus, it's not a bad movie either. The main theme of the story is Friendship and what it means to have a good friend. From the very beginning of the movie, every character is shown as different and meek and hence is constant source of bullying. They find solace with each other and form a gang called loser's club and enjoy each other's company.The subsequent growth of the character and defeating their deepest fear is depicted nicely.The another main theme of the movie is quashing your fear. It is clearly shown that the entity feeds on the fear of an individual. Hence to defend themselves or to defeat him they need to vanquish their fears. While watching movie, it was clearly evident that the movie is less of a horror and is more of a coming-of-age tale where characters by various means conquer their fears and learn more about their identity via a series of misadventures and learn about meaning of life, friendship, love, sexuality, loss and fear. So lets talk about pros. and cons. of the movie and what is my personal opinion after watching this movie.PROS.Performance of the cast - I really loved the performance of the cast. Everyone was suitable and acted well in their roles but the cast member which stood out for me is Sophia Lillis. I really liked her performance. The way in which she essayed the role of a sexually abused teen is seriously commendable. Other cast member like Jack Dylan Grazer, Jaeden Lieberher and Jeremy Ray Taylor were excellent in their respective roles.Their chemistry was endearing and organic. Another stand out role for me was that of Nicholas Hamilton. He really performed well in the role of a mentally troubled young sociopath.Musical score - Music of the film was quite good and matched consummately with the theme of the movie. The background score was also quite good which helped in intensifying the fear at some critical moments during the film.Well developed characters - The characters in the film are well written and developed which is a rare feat for a horror movie. The reason of every character's inherent fear is explained well. That's why characters feel so authentic while watching movie.Screenplay - IT is a rare horror film where so much effort has been put in writing. Screenplay is commendable.Cinematography - Cinematography of the film completely reflects the mood of the film be it the happy time with friends or be it the haunting wall of the entity. The camera accurately captures the tone of film and which in turn makes the movie more terror-stricken.CONS.Over reliance on Jump Scares - While the source material provides excellent opportunity to delve into the psychology of characters, the makers seemed to ignore it. While it could have been an excellent psychological horror film but due to excess reliance on jump scares it turns into an another run-of-the-mill horror film. This movie can be sighted as a prime example of why jump scare sucks? I was really disappointed due to the lack of genuinely frightening scenes in place of sleazy jump scares.Muddled storytelling - Storytelling could have been far more better. Some scene jumps from one to another without any proper motive or meaning. Also the film takes too long to build.Runtime - The film really test the patience of viewers too much during the film. The film could easily have been shortened by up to 15-20 minutes. 2nd half drags too much especially during overly long climax.Performance of Bill Skarsgard - This might be a controversial opinion but i really didn't like performance of eponymous character. While Bill tried his level best, it was evident that during some scenes he was trying a bit too much which was really unaffecting for me. The more he came to screen, the less menacing he became.Average direction - While the direction was not bad, it was not good either. Considering the fact that you have a great source material and a well written screenplay, you need to add some extra score points to the movie by using your direction. Instead of focusing on psychological aspects of the story, he focuses more on terrifying audiences with music and the clown, but after a certain point it all starts to fall flat. I am not exactly condemning direction but i am not impressed either by the endeavors of Andy Muschietti.So, in the end its another run-of-the-mill horror film despite having a great story.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A new era of horror. Pennywise goes CGI.,"Skarsgard is a mind-blowing new Pennywise. In Comparison with Tim Curry, he is much more subliminal. The old ""It"" sure is cult and has it's own charm, but the new one, which is made exactly 27 Years (hint!) after the TV-Movie, is well done about the parts the old movie-production could not portray/depict. But the new Pennywise Shows a freaking grimace, with blood-freezing effects. Creepy feelings predetermined by watching this clowny freak and his cabinet of freaky phenomens the Kids are facing in the movie.I like the thing, that the movie concentrates on the kids and does not such time-jumps like the TV-movie. So this is only the first part. an second part will follow, the producers announced. But we have to wait. They want to do this before the kids are to old, because the sequel allegedly will tell the story from grown-up point of few from the former kids and obviously tell the rest of the story in flashbacks.In the new ""It"", there are many things told better and more clear to view, but one thing is worse than in the old movie. ... I would rather have seen more quality in figurative characterization of the kids, like in the old movie. But that's the only point of critic for me.

IT review,"Even you are not a fan of Stephen King or horror, you should still watch the movie IT. As a suspense/horror film, the movie does a good job building the intrigue and mystery of the town of Derry as well as Pennywise the Clown. Pennywise looks very creepy and is an interesting and engaging villain. It uses impressive special effects for the demon clown and shows what IT is capable of becoming in order to scare the kids. Using their fears to attack them. There are some good jump scares but the movie does not overly rely on those.One thing that the movie does overly rely on is the music cues to build up the suspense. The overuse of it made the scare beats become a bit predictable in the film. There were also weird times when random songs would pop up and then be cut off abruptly. There were some cool camera tricks like rotating and zooming that I thought were impressive. Overall the film looks great and has an aesthetic similar to The Goonies or Stranger Things.What this movie succeeds at is telling the story of the children. This very much feels like a young adult coming of age story. The child actors all do a great job, and the characters are really engaging which allows the audience to become sympathetic to them. The story is focused on the kids and their fears. Each kid has a fear or obstacle in their life that they need to overcome in order to help defeat Pennywise. They are all very distinct characters but still feel like a group of friends. The movie was at its best when exploring the lives of the children.The movie touches on some of the mythology about Pennywise and the town of Derry, but it's important to remember that this is the first part of the story. There is going to be a sequel movie that can delve deeper into some of the material from the book. While there are some minor problems with the movie, it is still a very well made and engaging film that I recommend people checking out. Even though it's cast is a group of kids, I would not recommend anyone under the age of 13 due to some very adult themes and imagery. This movie succeeds at being a suspense drama with elements of horror that keeps the audience entertained throughout.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Fear.,"Wow, I went into this film knowing that so far it has had very good reviews and I have to say that I was not in the least bit disappointed. In fact I was very impressed by this film for how close it was to the book.Now going into this film I had previously read the book about two weeks prior so it was still fresh in my mind and the book is an absolute masterpiece! Now I never expected a 1000 page book to ever get every detail put into a film because that is nearly impossible but this film handled the job very well and for that I commend it.Now the film of course starts off with Georgie and his yellow slicker, I didn't know what to expect from this scene where we are first introduced to Pennywise in the drain with the boat but I have to say it was bloody terrifying! This was how I knew that the film was not going to stray far from the books gruesome details as Pennywise was immediately opened by ripping Georgie's arm right from its socket. This was petrifying, especially in an extremely dark cinema.Now perhaps there were maybe a few too many jump scares as the film didn't really need to add them for effect as it was extremely scary without because of Pennywise. Bill Skarsgard is the perfect Pennywise, there is absolutely no doubt about that and he is what really makes this film amazing. But also the kids who were played so so well and fit the characters so so well. Honestly this film is one of the best I have ever seen in my entire life!Did it include all of the details from the book?

It is a hit... or is it??,"I didn't really have much interest in seeing this, but I was bored and decided to go and see it....And....I was pleasantly surprised...I may be repeating what other people said, but I try not to read other reviews as to keep an open mind...I felt very much a - ""Stand By Me""... ""Goonies""... 80's kind of vibe... which I believe was the goal in this movie... I found myself very much on the side of the kids... in particular the character played by Jeremy Ray Taylor and Finn Wolfhard... These young actors really stole the show for me...However as for ""it"" being scary... Is there such a thing as an actual scary movie anymore?? Bearing in mind I am getting old now... I couldn't take Pennywise seriously and didn't find him scary at all... Bill Skarsgård played the part well.. but he wasn't as good as Tim Curry... He was good...

A Masterpiece. My favorite film of the decade,"This was probably my favorite horror movie I've ever seen. And I've seen far to many considering my wife constantly plays horror movies in thr house. I came in not expecting much but left being blown away by the story, characters, comedy, action, cinematography and jump scares all wrapped together perfectly.

Super 8 meets Jeepers Creepers.,"I haven't read the book. I haven't seen the original and I now wish I hadn't wasted my time and money by watching this movie either.As far as I could tell, this movie is aimed at kids and I actually found myself yawning all the way through. It just didn't work in any way whatsoever. The back story of why and how Pennywise came to be and why he does what he does isn't properly explained. In fact instead of a discernible story being told there's just a string of jump scenes separated by a few dialogues thrown in here and there.The only time I jumped in shock is when I added up the cost of the evening.'IT' is a floater.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pennywise Returns: Did He Float Our Fears?,"Remember the chilling whispers of Pennywise the clown echoing through your childhood nightmares? Well, he's back in IT (2017), ready to terrify a new generation (and maybe give some millennials flashbacks). But does this latest adaptation float, or does it sink under the weight of comparisons and overhype?Let's start with the good stuff: This film nails the atmosphere. It oozes with that classic 80s Stephen King vibe, all small-town dread and neon-drenched shadows. The Losers' Club, a band of misfit kids facing their deepest fears (both literal and metaphorical), is charmingly portrayed, and their camaraderie provides the emotional core that keeps you invested. And of course, there's Bill Skarsgård's Pennywise. He's creepy, contorting, and unsettling - a worthy successor to Tim Curry's iconic performance, even if he takes things in a slightly different (and perhaps more disturbing) direction.But here's where things get a little, well, clowny. The story itself feels uneven. While the first half builds dread effectively, the second half dives into CGI-heavy battles that lose some of the initial creepiness. The pacing falters at times, and some character development gets sacrificed for jump scares. It's like Pennywise himself - initially terrifying, but eventually predictable, relying more on cheap thrills than sustained scares.So, is IT worth a watch? If you're looking for a nostalgic trip down memory lane with some genuinely creepy moments, then sure, give it a shot. But don't go in expecting a horror masterpiece. This Pennywise might float, but he doesn't quite reach the heights of his terrifying legend.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
IT is the best remake I've ever seen for horror movie!,"IT was my #1 movie as a kid that really scared the crap out of me more then any other horror movie did in my day, and was the sole reason for my clown phobia that I still have to this day!! I had really high expectation's for this one and went into it with not much hope for it being able to have the same effect on kids like the original did to me as a kid. I'm glad I'm not a kid right now after seeing the new one, it did not disappoint me now at 37 one bit!! I took my 14 year son to see IT at the IMAX theater, the enormous screen and ridiculously load sound system intensified his fear that much more for this movie I think. I was laughing pretty hard a couple times when my son and at least half of the other people watching jumped back in there seats while letting out a scream. IT is a must for any fan of the original I promise you won't be even slightly disappointed, and the same for pretty much anyone else unless you scare easily!!

"Not too bad, kept kind of true to the book","A Solid Adaptation with Missed Opportunities
IT Chapter 1 does a commendable job of translating Stephen King's classic horror novel to the big screen, but it falls short in a few areas. The performances, particularly from the young cast portraying the Losers Club, are great. Bill Skarsgård's portrayal of Pennywise is chilling and unforgettable. The film successfully captures the eerie atmosphere of Derry, making the town feel alive and sinister.That said, the adaptation misses some key elements from the book that could have enriched the story. It would have been more compelling if the movie had delved deeper into each character's individual fears and their psychological struggles. Additionally, the pacing is uneven, with some scenes feeling rushed and others dragging unnecessarily.Despite these shortcomings, IT Chapter 1 is an enjoyable and frightening ride. While it effectively captures the essence of the story, staying truer to the source material and fine-tuning the pacing could have elevated it even further.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

These Dang Kids Need to Stop Clowning Around!,"Clowns look pretty freaky, right? I remember feeling quite unnerved by them in my younger days, yet as I got older, clowns intimidated me less. To be frank, clowns land more along the lines of ""creepy"" rather than scary, unlike real unmasked people who could hurt you.It's familiar opening scene captures that true scariness: an unsupervised small boy takes a paper boat out on a rainy day, which falls down the sewer drain. A clown peers his head up from below the darkness, his appearance throwing the boy off guard. He displays unusual kindness to the boy, returning to him the lost paper boat. Then suddenly, the predator chews the boy's arm off, and a God's eye view looks down on his poor defenseless body flowing into the drain, a truly disturbing sight in this otherwise misguided adaptation of Stephen King's classic novel.Now, I understand the movie's current rave, as It now stands at 90% on RottenTomatoes, and YouTube celebrity Chris Stuckmann gave It an A-, but I for one differ from the public opinion.Although the critical praise does speak some truth; each preteen we meet goes through change in some way. The sewer-bound kid's stuttering brother, Bill, is shunned by everybody, and his friends each face their personal growing pains too. Eddie is forced against his will to keep taking meds, Richie resents whatever his friends tell him to do, and Stanley refuses to pursue his family's Jewish beliefs. Other friends they make include a Black farmer boy, Mike, who must kill sheep for his heartless father, Ben, an overweight new kid who needs friends outside of the books, and Beverly, a gorgeous flame-haired drug addict. Her father creates by far the creepiest moments, as he sniffs her hair like some sex offender. The horror should stem from places like here, the common fears every teenager shares.Instead, the inexperienced director, Andy Muschietti, abused Dutch angles and motion sickness while filming the ""scary"" moments. He followed the common misconception that low lighting adds to the fright, which in actuality hurt the thrill here since you now cannot tell what is supposed to scare you. Think about some of the most iconic shots in horror: The shower scene in Psycho, the twins in The Shining, Jack Nicholson in the same movie shouting ""Here's Johnny!"", or even in the original It when Pennywise pops out from beneath the pale-tinted shower. Notice a theme? These images are each evenly lit, anything hidden in the shadows contrasting against something else to fear. Truly effective horror fills in the unknown blanks based on what you think you already see. Maybe if Muschietti utilized real fears, such as a community's religious state, other than clichés, and knew how to stage them, then these scares could leave a longer impression to the extent of The Exorcist.The scares particularly fail more due to the atrocious casting of the child actors. Whenever the kids were supposed to act afraid, they just stared blankly and walked stiltly. Even outside the scary scenes, the kids either talked too fast or too slow while screaming their lines when supposed to act angry. Based on speculation, these annoying kids obviously achieved their chemistry by following tape marks and cue cards with the direction, ""Just say your lines and go home."" These kids' stories also lack any structural balance. The brother-to- brother bond initiated right at the start gets forgotten across a large portion, especially at the very last scene; and Stanley's Jewish struggles loses any footing with little to do compared to the stronger treatment of his friends. As for the bullies, their interesting backstories receive an undeservingly low amount of screen time, instead existing more for lazy predictable scenarios we've seen countless times.Very little fear strikes your nerve in these moments, as you can never empathize with these kids' foul-mouthed tendencies. Rather than showing the hard reality of growing up, the kids celebrate their hatred against the oppressors. It even attempts to beautify the one female preteen, Beverly, as much as possible, as she jumps into a lake wearing only her underwear, then lets her new boyfriends gawk at her body as she naps in their eyesight. Then in another dialogue played only for laughs, a pharmacist, who she says looks like Clark Kent, comments her back, saying she looks like Lois Lane! Honestly, the whole beautification of her character made me feel pedophilic myself.I read several reports that the clowning industry has suffered because of It, promoting coulrophobia, I find this hard to believe. It does not feed off coulrophobia, but rather anthropophobia, particularly predatorial parents. No wonder the Alamo Drafthouse theaters in Austin and Brooklyn hosted all-clown screenings, since clearly, we might as well root for the demonic circus act to win!",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
A chilling adaptation with some missteps,"""IT"" (2017) brings Stephen King's classic horror novel to the big screen with a modern twist. Set in the 1980s, it follows a group of outcast kids known as the Losers' Club as they confront their deepest fears in the form of the terrifying clown Pennywise, brilliantly portrayed by Bill Skarsgård.The film excels in capturing the essence of childhood camaraderie and the dynamics within the Losers' Club. The young cast, including Jaeden Martell, Finn Wolfhard, and Sophia Lillis, delivers strong performances, bringing authenticity and depth to their characters. Skarsgård's Pennywise is both unsettling and memorable, adding a fresh, creepy vibe to the iconic villain.Visually, ""IT"" is striking, with effective use of special effects and atmospheric settings that heighten the tension. The film successfully blends horror with moments of humor and heart, making it more than just a scare-fest.However, the movie sometimes relies too heavily on jump scares, which can feel repetitive. The pacing also falters at points, causing some scenes to drag. Despite these flaws, ""IT"" offers a solid horror experience with standout performances and a nostalgic look at the fears and friendships of childhood.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best adaptations of Stephen King's work to date.,"IT is a horror drama film based on the Stephen King novel of the same name. Starring Bill Skarsgård in the title role, the film not only succeeds as a terrifying horror film but also as one of the best adaptations of Stephen King's work to date. In 1989 in the town of Derry, Maine, a group of outcast kids known as the ""Losers Club"", are each terrorised by a frightening, shape-shifting entity they collectively refer to as ""IT"". When no one else in town will come to their aide, the kids decide to band together and fight against ""IT"" themselves while also overcoming their own personal demons. Like with comedy, horror is a highly subjective genre. What one may find scary may cause others to roll their eyes in annoyance. Thankfully, IT provides enough scares that seem as realistic as possible and prevent the film from being silly. This retelling takes itself very seriously and doesn't constantly rely on jump scares for legitimate horror, instead by building a creepy atmosphere of uncertainty and individual torment in each of the kids. The cast is fantastic, Bill Skarsgard's performance as IT, in particular that of his clown form Pennywise, is terrifying, almost on par with Heath Ledger's Joker in The Dark Knight. He definitely feels like more of a threat than Tim Curry's version, whom by today's standards seems a little too goofy and wacky to be scary. In addition to Pennywise, all of the child actors are brilliant. Not once did I ever feel unconvinced of the fear that they were feeling. Even the usual Stephen King tropes seemed more subdued in this film, aside from the usual setting in Maine, of course. If this is the future for adaptations of Stephen King's work, then I am most certainly on board. I rate it 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A fun, classic, Amblin inspired and completely recognisably Stephen Kingian buddy horror.","Stings of 80's moments, little character moments and all the classics of 'don't go in the monster house' make for a glossy, seat-back horror that's a lot of fun to watch. Enough of the source novel and lore; turtles and the deadlights etc. are used well enough to make me want to google what their relevance is but not enough to get in the way or detract from the tone and thrust of the core story. The horror is squealingly good fun, not too disgusting or crass or affecting, and instead like good camp fire horror.
Pennywise is well realised and the child actors are all solid, dialogue and script is enjoyable and the directing and cinematography is top notch.

Dark, creepy, tense and macabre with some humour in places and feeling like a cross between Stand By Me, an 80's Stephen King adaptation, The Goonies, Nightmare On Elm Street, Super 8 and TV series Stranger Things and faithful to the mini series without copying it.

I Might Actually Be Underrating This...,"I vaguely remember being at a friend's house for a sleepover once and one of the kids sneaking in the Tim Curry mini-series VHS of It into the VCR, and slowly falling asleep to a creepy clown doing goofy things. However, this newest iteration of Stephen King's cultural behemoth is one of the most utterly surprising and purely fun experiences I've had all year. An endless barrage of horror visuals and teenage whimsy, it's as dementedly scary as it is brightly charming. Eighties set and inspired, it brings to mind Goonies, E.T, and the rest of the Amblin films repertoire, much like Abrams' Super 8 or more recently Netflix's ""Stranger Things"" did before it. The comparisons are inevitable, especially given the casting of the ""Stranger Things"" lead Wolfhard. However, where those sometimes walk the line between homage and straight-up copy bluntly, It manages to mostly stand on its own; and either way, we simply don't get movies this sincere and thoughtful, while also being terrifyingly entertaining, enough anymore. If it takes reminding us of bygone decades to do it, then I'm all for it. This 135 minute nostalgia nightmare can be a daunting undertaking, not just for the filmmakers but for the audience. However, so much creepy goodness is packed into its runtime, it not only doesn't feel overlong, but seems to have a high re-watchability factor. Even with some of the stale drama and less-than-perfect child performances, the screen is so filled with terrifying bumps, sunny disturbia, and a welcome onslaught of tension-breaking humor, I can imagine happily running into Pennywise over and again.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

How bad can a movie be made for $35million,"Well, this bad. IT is an awful movie which has 14 and 15 year old actors playing between the age 13 year old's. Their acting is worse than the 1990 mini-series. The plot, which is never fleshed out thanks to being based on America's worst living author, is a mix of disjointed fears brought to life with the most fake blood ever used in a movie. I swear the ketchup my brother and I used when trying to shock mom was more realistic. The cinematography was awful as the lenses used and lighting were sophomoric at best. The CGI used was nothing great and was merely on the level of John Carpenter's The Thing from the early eighties. The Pennywise actor did his best Tim Curry impersonation but missed it by a few very large shoes to fill. I know why Pop culture has never been my thing because if the pop crowd thinks this is a good movie, then I feel sorry for our future.

Holds much of the heart of the book,"Right from the start, the scene of the little one feeding the hungry one sets a great tone. I thought that one more than anything else was a huge success. What a meal he must have made...I can see an absurd positive and absurd negative trend going on in the ratings. This is not a 10 lol at least, not in relation to its source material, however, in no way does it deserve a 1 or a 2...The thing is, having suffered The Dark Tower movie, a truly atrocious experience to any fan, I felt that while ""It"" similarly only shares the title and the characters names with the source material, at least, with the background of the novel, you could relate and understand the personality quirks of the characters that is lacking any real context or explanation within the movie itself. At least they tried to be themselves, to stay true to the characters.The location and actors are all amazing, and did all that could be expected of them.See, for me, the reason the movie is a success is because it managed to portray (at least to me) the bond among the children, and the human/emotional aspect that made this and other SK titles like ""The Body A.K.A Stand by Me"" such a treat.The only real letdown to me is the era. Setting it so much later has an odd twist on the tone. It's hard to explain, but these are people out of time... There's no need for that, except maybe cheaper sets?...Anyways, while not the true adaptation to the novel a die hard fan might like, I think it still retains much of its flavor and appeal.

Loved IT,"My expectations for IT were to get a few scares, watch some likable characters, but most of all be entertained. It's a film about a killer clown, not Citizen Kane. IT exceeded my expectations. I didn't get terrified, I only jumped a few times yet it never lost its pace and the intensity. The monster itself was incredibly done and chilling to watch. There was a combination of make-up, practical effects and CGI to bring Pennywise to life. His first appearance at the beginning had me a little worried for a second. I was thinking: ""he's kinda funny actually- OH SH*T""! It's an incredible performance from Bill Skarsgård and I hope he doesn't quit the role.I found the group of friends to be very entertaining and funny. The Losers Club as they call themselves are a group of characters we can truly root for. We want to see them make it. The development is good for the main characters of the group but a few of the others felt left out in the end. The film also opens with one of these characters but that character is non-existent for nearly 20 min after that. Its a small editing flaw and hardly subtracts from the film.I loved watching IT but I think we need to stop pretending like its a 10/10 movie. Overhyping a film can lead to the wrong expectations. As long as you have the same expectations as I did you'll love it. IT is a good time at the movies and might be more scarier to some than it was for me but IT is nonetheless less a great watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Too Dark!,"Well I liked the 1990's mini series, the horror aspect came eventually but the series spent a lot of time exploring bonds of friendship between a group of teen outcasts during a typical innocent summer adventure gone wrong.I felt like this remake focused much more on the horror aspect and not enough time exploring the group friendship aspect. Pennywise was a lot more menaching from the start and I am not sure I am a big fan of child mutilation and gore was a bit too much. I am fine with varying degrees of gore with adults but I don't know if I can stomach kids. Maybe its because I am getting old but certain elements of the kids lives felt a bit forced.I guess as a horror story of its own, its not quite as bad if you can stand seeing a bunch of kids being traumatized. I am interested in seeing the sequel and how it handles itself. Overal its an okay movie but it a little too forced in a few areas.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Probably in need of a director's cut,"I liked the movie. It was what I thought it would be: a blend between a Nightmare on Elm Street and the Goonies.It is not excellent. But it's a good watch. The most anticipated scene which sees Georgie's death didn't let me down. Here and there, there were good ideas that caught me mumbling: ""wow that's so cool... man that was so creepy...""Of course the movie edges away a bit from the book. At times it will even feel rushed. I would guess a couple of scenes didn't make it to the final cut, leading to a few issues.For instance, the kids' characters are not fully developed (not all of them at least) and a little more backstory or screen time would help.It would also help to develop further the story of Derry, which should be an incredibly gloomy background for the characters. So far, what we know about the town is mainly what the kids mention when they chitchat. But it's something we need to feel and see for ourselves.And we need much more presence from Henry Bowers and his sidekicks, as well as more reasonable explanations as for why he is such a dangerous bully.The movie lacks tension, I would say, and the now famous trailer made me feel much more uncomfortable than the whole flick.Overall, the movie should make us feel unsafe wherever we go: Pennywise, Derry, the adults, Henry Bowers... there should be no escaping. Instead, we get a little bit of each, and never really feel that threatened.It feels like they used from the book strictly what they deemed absolutely essential to the movie, discarding minors points that could actually help build tension or develop characters and situations.Regarding Pennywise, I am not sure. I guess the more you see It, the less afraid of It you get. If Pennywise were less present, or if It were some kinda of a silent, lurking shadow, it may work a bit better in terms of fear and tension factor. But It still is a good horror movie clown and with Bill Skarsgård's acting, It often wavers between a clown-dressed maniac and a primal creature who's got a stomach where It should have a brain.Having said that, it's a movie you want to like before seeing it, and I would happily see it again: the cast acts wonderfully well (special accolade to Ben Hanscom, Beverly Marsh and Georgie Denbrough). The 80s twist will make us, 80s kids, feel quite nostalgic with the whole familiar atmosphere.Again, a good movie, not a masterpiece but a movie that hopefully will feel more complete with a possible director's cut, and with flaws that will help make its adult-focused second part perfect.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not bad..!,"Although I feel like this film is more fit for younger crowds as an adult I enjoyed watching this film. The pacing is a little slow however the storytelling is good and well structured. But the best thing about IT is the casting! This is a great cast of characters and they did an amazing job bringing life and individuality to their roles. Each character stands out in their own way, everyone's personality complimented each other and I loved the dialogue between this group of friends.Throughout the film we get good thrills and a decent amount of jumpscares to keep us entertained.

Best King Horror Adaptation,"What is It? Well, It is the best Stephen King horror adaptation since Kubrick's over-indulgent The Shining, and It surpasses The Shining on so many levels. We come to the town of Derry, Maine, a town that has six-times the national average of missing people and murders. That has a huge skewing once every 27 years when It stalks food for hibernation. That is according to Ben Hanscom (Jeremy Ray Taylor), Derry's newest pre-teen denizen. He shares this information with some other kids like Bill (Jaeden Lierbeher), Richie (Finn Wolfhard), Eddie (Jack Dylan Grazer), Mike (Chosen Jacobs), Stanley (Wyatt Oleff), and Beverly (Sophia Willis). They are, in fact, the Losers Club because of their age (middle school) and tics. Bill stutters, Eddie is smothered with a hypochondriac mother, and Mike who only has the sin of being black in a very white-bred town. They are all having visions of Pennywise the Clown (Bill Skarsgard). He tricks them with illusions to create ghastly fear, and he operates from the sewers of the city to get his prey. In fact, one of his recent victims was Bill's little brother, Georgie. Of course, this motion picture only reflects the first half of King's classic novel. A sequel will reveal the second half in which the afore-mentioned come back together as adults to confront It again. If this one is any indication of the sequel, audiences will wait with heavy anticipation. It has a great screenplay penned by Chase Palmer, Careu Fkuanga, and Gary Dauberman that respects the source material and adapts it well to modern times. Even better is the direction offered by Andy Muschietti. I will add kudos to cinematography and editing of Choon-tuk Chung and Jason Pallantin, respectively. All these elements blend for a perfect recipe of horror and suspense. Jump scares are plenty without being triggered by the gotcha tropes of dogs, cats, and friends around the corner. The scares are for the monsters, visions, and disturbing images. The suspense is geared up with unpredictability. What will happen? How will these kids stop It? Even more troublesome is the evil perpetrated by real humans. The adult figures are often the absent, abusive, and overbearing parents, and the vicious bullies in town. What really makes this one work, though, are the believable, earnest performances of the young kids. We can identify with them as the ones being picked on for being fat, bookish and nerdy, or for stuttering. Even these children have differences between themselves. The 1990 TV mini-series has nothing on this one as it is raised to a level of reality without the camp or cheesy early 1990's special effects. Now to hope the sequel will live up to the success of the current installment and live up to expectations.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not so scary for horror fans, but many times funny dialogues","Classic R movie, where kids swear and its funny. writter put adults jokes into the kids mouths meanwhile horror side of the movie wasn't scary at all.. maybe one two scary moments like bathroom at the girl or whatever.. Only great thing for me was the beginning scene which was portrayed in very good style and without any compromise.. lil bit disappointed tho.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Absolutely hilarious,"I watched this with a friend at around 1 in the morning. I don't know if it was the movie or lack of sleep from the night before, but we laughed our asses off throughout this movie. There were one or two instances where the movie actually got a tiny bit scary, but that didn't last for more than 30 seconds each. After the semi-tense moment passed it was followed by some penny wise scene that was comedy gold. One time he jiggle ran at a kid and another he literally started bouncing side to side. I get this movie was aimed at a child's perception of fear, but my god this isn't what id call a horror movie. We constantly laughed throughout this movie (mostly at pennywise's shenanigans), and we enjoyed it thoroughly. Horror movie: 1/10 horror spoof comedy: 10/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pretty Good,"This movie is It meets Stranger Things. The movie was amazing and tons of fun. There are a few big jump scares from here to there, but overall it was a coming to age story. The kids were hilarious and amazing and each stood out in their own way. Stan, the Jewish kid, and Mike, the black kid, were pushed to the back burner. I think Mike had like six lines in the entire movie. The actor who played Pennywise was amazing creepy and scary. I also liked how even the adults in the movie were scary too. One guy I thought was It in the trailer was a regular character in the movie. I loved the actress who played Beverly because her storyline was the scariest because it was real life horror. And anyone with common sense knowing the movie was going to modernized knows what the writers changed with her storyline. I loved the cute little love triangle which was kid friendly. My only dislike was the kids' filthy mouth and constant profanity. I was able to show my nephew the original It as his Introduction to Horror because it was scary and clean without the dirty jokes. This one is laced with funny jokes that aren't appropriate for kids spoken by kids. I overall enjoyed this version as I did the 1990s It starring Tim Curry. Both are amazing but this It is only a different interpretation of the same story. This movie also has rewatchability like a fun horror ride at an amusement park you want to get back on to ride again and again. Amazing movie, great standout characters, great casting, great cinematography,and a creepy atmosphere. This movie is like going on an adventure you want to go on again and again. Yes, you can love the book, the original movie, and this version too. An amazing fun movie you will enjoy and think about the scary fun you had afterwards. It sticks with you like a great childhood memory.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Not Horrifying,I just took my family to see IT. The kids were scared while my husband and I kept looking at each other and we were both thinking the same thing that this is like a kids movie. They should have just made it into a cartoon. We were both so hyped up for a good scare instead we got a dancing clown with a baby voice. The kids loved it.,2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Metaphor for your FEARS,"When I was younger and watched the original IT I didn't like it at all. I found it quite boring. I watched it again later as an adult and then I had a very different perspective. I started to understand the deeper meaning behind the story.I watched this new remake and I have to say as as horror fan, this Pennywise scares me much more.If you want pure horror (which I'm also a big fan of), then this may not be your cup of tea.
This is a film with a deep story and good character development where you feel the pain of each of these outsider kids. It's about being bullied, being the new kid, being the tomboy, being the kid with the stutter, being the chubby kid, being a redhead, being the immigrant kid, being the kid with a dead sibling, or simply being different.
Pennywise the evil clown sums up and symbolizes the internal pain and struggles of eacg of these kids and their friendship is the best means to destroy the pain, the fear, which is the demon within.I always thought I didn't get Stephen King and his films never made sense to me. Maybe this was because 1. I was too young to appreciate the hidden meaning and 2. I only looked for a film that would scare me, regardless of the depth of the film.The Incest Issue:
I'm giving it 6/10 because of scenes where a father seems to express incestuous feelings toward his own daughter. I'm aware that this is unfortunately a very painful issue that has happened to some. I would just be very uncomfortable if I had to watcg it with my father or if my daughter ever saw it. I guess since this (fortunately) doesn't happen in most households, even bringing up the possibility of such feelings may not be appropriate (even in the context of criticism).",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Outstanding! Not so much scary as it is engrossing,"I went into this movie on the fence about it. I did like the trailers a lot, but the film was extremely hyped and I wasn't THAT excited to see it. However, it blew away my expectations. One thing this film did extremely well was tell a story. No, it wasn't all that scary, but more of a mystery/thriller, which was OK with me.The cast was perfectly cast, and everyone had great chemistry together. The film also really did an excellent job of creating a mysterious atmosphere around Pennywise and his taking of the children.Though the film was over two hours long, it didn't feel overly long at all. Overall, a great movie. It really captured the atmosphere of the small town and the events happening, and also did a great job of creating a mystery.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""It"" is now the definitive","I can't understand the negative reviews at all, I've read the book twice and loved every sentence of ""It"" The original was good and Tim Curry legendary as Pennywise but by god Skarsgad does an excellent job. It really does stand up against the original and surpasses it of course there is a bigger budget here and way better effects. There is nothing really scary about it like any normal horror but it's a great drama with the ageless charm of "" Stand By Me "" and the supernatural of "" Stranger Things "" you really can't go wrong and for me this hasn't.The casting is superb all the kids interactions are well done and funny, Pennywise is excellent and will make you hate clowns all over again. The town of Derry looks quaint and charming and you would want to spend your summers there once ""It"" has went to sleep.It remains to see how the handle Chapter 2 and who they cast, for me casting big names to the roles may ruin it. I personally feel it won't be as good as Chapter 1 but if they get anywhere near it and do a decent reveal of ""It"" then job well done.For me this is now the Defin-It-I've version",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
HORROR FOR YOUNGER AUDIENCES,"Just the right amount of horror and occasional comedy. This horror-adaptation was justifiably one of the best horror movies of 2017. From the production design to editing, no unnecessary scenes were featured throughout the entire film. The cinematography was good. The actors' performances were on-point and the direction was straight to the point. I just wonder if the movie could have been greater. The scenes were amazing, the jumpscares were efficient, but as the movie progressed, there was something mediocre in the film I cannot quite figure out. Maybe it was the story or the plotholes. But over-all it was decent clown-horror flick.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
More than a horror film,"This is my first review and I will keep it short and to the point. This film is not your average horror flick because it tells a story. The story it tells is from the perspective of a group of kids, some might even call them ""losers."" It is a narrative of courage, friendship, and good verses evil. Eddie was my favorite, but all the kids killed it. Pennywise was creepy, a brilliant performance by Bill Skarsgard. It was definitely worth my money.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Feels like two totally different movies mashed together; an occasionally suspenseful horror flick with visual flair.,"'It (2017)' feels like two totally different movies mashed together. At times, the combination is successful, most notably when the rag-tag team of friends (whom are all played remarkably well by the young actors) band together to face their fears and tackle the forces that threaten them. For the first half of the piece, though, these differing genres exist almost entirely in isolation from one another, with only the occasional scare reminding both us and the characters of the danger lurking in the sewers just out of view. This lack of discipline, which leads to a slightly odd structure and a pretty lax pacing, makes the already long picture seem even longer. Yet the film is never boring nor does it ever come close to being so. The teen-drama aspects are compelling enough to carry you through to the horror elements later on. When things truly kick off, the feature becomes much more entertaining and suspenseful. It puts you in the shoes of the kids and becomes incredibly crowd-pleasing when they start to fight back. Even though it is never particularly scary, it is often fairly tense. The inhuman killer clown Pennywise is notably good, too, in both design and performance, though he doesn't appear as often as perhaps advertised. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Sinister, Jumpy and Creepy but awesome","Im usually very fussy about movies that I want to go and see because lets face it, it's not cheap these days to go to the cinema especially when they charge 4pounds for popcorn therefore you want the movie that your going to see be the perfect film. But anyways I decided to go to the cinema with my girlfriend after seeing the reception that this movie received with all positive reviews and let me tell you, you know a movie is good when your left thinking about it for days afterwards. If you are wanting a movie that will leave you thinking about it and wanting to read the book afterwards then this is the movie for you.This is what happens when the movie is based on amazing source material from the likes of Stephen King who is a prestigious horror author whose written the likes of the Shining, Salems lot, misery and many more. The movie was jumpy and the clown was very sinister/creepy but the movie also had a lot of charm to it catching a late 80s feel to it. THIS IS THE BEST HORROR FILM I've seen in a long time and the let's face the Horror Genre has long been in dire need for a film like this. The characters were on point, you actually cared for most of them. So character development for each character was perfect. There were also plenty of comical elements in the film with also the right amount of shocking scary moments.In all,my suggestion would be to take heed in all the positive reviews and follow suit with going to watch this great compelling tense story in the cinema to get the most from this movie. The clown in my opinion, was probably the 2nd best clown performance after the Joker (Heath Ledger)that I have ever seen, so full credit to the actor who played him. I would not be surprised if he was tipped to play the Joker in future batman films. But yes you will not be disappointed with this movie, it has everything that a 15year old and older would ever want. So Enjoy!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good but over-hyped,"Went to see this movie amid much hype and talk. In that sense was disappointed.However, the acting of the protagonists is superb. The ""it"" is scary in the beginning, but the tremendous amount of gore that was shown, I think, made the movie at par with ordinary horror movies.The clown deserves praise, even though it really had to go overboard sometimes to scare anyone. I would rate Conjuring quite higher compared to this.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Unfortunately not that good,"Disclaimer - this is my favorite book of all time.The first 10 minutes was beautiful and I had my hopes up. The amount of details included from the book were very good. Then suddenly the movie turned into disjointed scenes with a bunch of scare jumps that are really not that scary unless your perhaps 10.The deviation from the book is ridiculous, almost worse than the original mini series. I think the kids did a great job and Bill Skarsgård shined when they didn't ruin his character with CGI, but unfortunately this movie left me disappointed. I think people who have not read the book might enjoy it, but they'll never get the true dread, hopelessness and fear that the book instills by watching this. I'm going to recommend the book instead of this attempt.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Entertaining, but nothing much.","A good horror picture with excellent music, brilliant acting from the main cast who make it all the more believable.

The story is very interesting and you can always follow along, with the brilliant writing and characters.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
It Was Good.,"I enjoyed It thoroughly, but I'm quite curious as to how Chapter Two can achieve and maintain being scary when considering what was necessary for the children to accomplish for them to be able to defeat ""It.""Though I enjoyed this movie, I did feel that it perhaps ran longer than it needed to, or maybe it didn't quite use the time as efficiently as it could have, because as fun as it really was, something about it wasn't as satisfying as I would've liked it to be. I understand the point was to focus on the children, but something about just focusing on them, made other parts of the story feel somewhat unattended. And yes, I'm well aware that when it comes to the mystery factor, it is Stephen King's style to leave certain areas of the story to the imagination, but in how Andres Muschietti told this story, the full on focus on the kids didn't feel enough for me.All the kids played their parts very well though, and after watching this movie, I see now why Jack Dylan Grazer was as good as he was in SHAZAM!, and Bill Skarsgard was great at it/It too. The movie overall was quality, and a very good addition to the horror genre, and though I have my gripes about either its length or the use of it, the acting however, as well as their dynamic as a group, and the horror elements were quite the enjoyable spectacle though. 7.3/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent adaptation from Stephen King novel.,"Many Stephen King filming are pure rubbish. It is very hard to bring Kings twisted books to a good film adaptation. Books are often so massive and text so weird, that making them a proper movie is almost impossible. Only few of Stephen King filming are goo, most are bad. IT belongs to good ones. Director has been wise to split massive book to two movies. Original book meander between 50's and 80's. In this movie story has split to two stories. First one has moved from 50's to 80's and second movie will be placed to present day. Very clever, because 80's is so nostalgic these days. Everybody who has seen Stranger Things in Netflix knows, that 80's nostalgic is very popular right now. Somehow IT reminds much like a Stand by Me and Goonies, but at the same time those movies are like kids movies compared to IT.Many times children actors are embarrassing to watch, but somehow these young actors are brilliant. Characters are plausible and you will get fond of them enough, that the scary scenes are really scare. Compared to many present horror movies, IT won't have too much digital effects, that makes it feels even more scarier. Nostalgic imagery combined to old school horror works well. Music and sound effects are used wisely, but effective.If somebody still remember the old TV-series from same story and traumas it left, you won't be disappointed. IT update nostalgic horror wisely to present day. Even story has now divided to two parts, movie still works perfectly as a independent story. Massive 180 million box office at the first weekend although will guarantee, that we will see the second part very soon.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't expect a particularly scary movie,"The film IT is a remake of Stephen King's brilliant book. The film is good and full of parts of tension and stress with the horror of the film was not so scary and it felt a little lacking to me. I recommend to fans of the genre to see it. The movie has violent parts like murder and swearing etc... it is not intended for children or people who are easily scared it should be intended for ages 17 and up. The actor Bill Skarsgård who played Pennywise in both IT movies does an excellent job, the tension he creates throughout the movie is one of the reasons for the movie to be what it is. The other actors like Sophia Liles, Finn Wolfhard, Jack Dylan Grazer, Wyatt Olaf and the rest of the gang give the movie an atmosphere of good friendship and consideration for others.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

They had a good thing in the beginning....,"The beginning scene had me thrilled to see the rest. The creature was diabolical and sinister, and the director wasn't afraid to gore and kill a child to sell it. There was a mystique to the creature at this time.Unfortunately, it slowly fell apart from there. The story became plotless and the creature became CGI comedy. The creature became easily fooled and beaten by ""loser"" children. The target audience in the second half must have been children. They used togetherness and love to defeat the creature. I'll watch reruns of Full House for that kind of educational experience.I came into the movie without expectations. I hadn't seen the original. I was quickly moved to high expectations after the opening scene. Unfortunately for cinema, this became another lazy, CGI feel-good movie under the guise of being an old fashioned horror flick.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Disappointing,"I love the original book by Stephen King and though it's really bad I enjoyed the mini series mainly due to Tim curry's performance and the campy nature of it. I was really excited for this film especially when the trailers came out and it seemed like everything I wanted and when the reviews came out I couldn't wait to see it but when I finally saw it I was kinda let down.The performances are good especially Bill Skarsgård and it's a pretty faithful adaptation of the book but it was a boring, scareless film. It never felt very tense and any scene that could have been somewhat scary was ruined by a pointless jump scare that made most of the scenes more annoying than scary. However the special effects are well done and the humour is decent however it's overall a boring, frightless film that left me extremely disappointed.Maybe it may have been the reviews that made my expectations really high but I've tried to watch it a few times trying to like it but just can't.

"Excellent, Awesomely Crafted Horror Movie","Phew this movie was absolutely amazing! It was having quite a lot of scary images and shocking disturbing scenes. What I love most about this movie was the great sound effects. They were really exceptional and I think a lot of us in the audience (especially my wife and including myself) were given the scare due to the sound effects. If you have seen the trailer and you already thought it was amazing, well you ain't seen nothing yet, coz the movie was way better. This was not a movie where all the good things have been shown in the trailer and there were no more surprises.I also loved the way the movie's tone was constantly interesting. Whenever the scene was not creepy or scary, the behavior of the kids were always fun to see. It had an aura of ""coming to age"" in this movie with so many natural things that boys their age would do/face (you will get loads of laughs during the swimming part, or Ben's crush on Beverly and many more). They would definitely grow on you. The characterization of the clown by Bill Skarsgård was spot on and he was indeed quite scary. The kids gave wonderful performances as well. We could actually picture them as kids in real life.Another good part was the setting (like the bikes, the houses, the costumes) that really gave the feel of 1980s. Including the popular boy band then, i.e. New Kids on the Block and the iconic walkman. As a horror movie, I think this one successfully gave us a scare, but apart from those scary moments, I think the best part was the ability of the director (Andrés Muschietti who directed another horror movie Mama in 2013) to direct a bunch of young actors and actress and create a great movie. I think this one was worthy of all the buzz and I can understand why it was loved by those movie critics.Overall, this movie was awesome entirely. I had a most interesting experience watching this movie in the theater with my wife. Not even the loud voices of people next to me could disturb my enjoyment. So please for those of you horror lovers, you should watch this one at the theaters near you asap. It is definitely worth to see either with your loved ones or with your friends, but this one not suitable for kids, even if the majority of the casts are children. I think those who loved the novel IT written by Stephen King would enjoy this one as well. I understand it was a very good adaptation of the novel, much better than The Dark Tower. And better not miss this one out coz the ending of the movie gave the hint of a possible sequel (fingers crossed). Oh ya, there was no post end credit scene that you probably expect from this kind of movie, though there was some interesting thing just before the end in case you want to wait for it.for my complete review, pls have a look at michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not scary but it's still good,"The fact that I didn't find the film scary was a massive disappointment. That said, it was still enjoyable, just take the movie for what it was and there are a lot of positives to speak of. The film's main strength is the children, all of whom were really impressive. They each have their own unique personality, which we get to see early on. As the story develops we get a look at each of them individually and discover their fears and other issues including difficult home lives. Their individual sections I thought were great. They all had different and interesting back stories. There's no doubting when they're together it feels like a mash up of classic 80's movies. The interactions between them were fun and you can't help but like them. Some of the imagery looked really good. Individual stills of Pennywise (or some of the other things that scared the kids) were fantastic and would make for great posters. I also liked the score. Skarsgard as did a decent job. The parts when he spoke certainly were certainly creepy. I just wish there were more scenes like at the beginning where we see his threatening predatory side, rather than the supernatural side of him. Overall, It might not be all that scary, but it's still a really good film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

More closely aligned with the book.,"As much as lots of my generation loved the TV version of IT, it wasn't really as dark and gruesome as the book. Tim Curry was ingrained in our brains as Pennywise. This one is a lot better. Skarsgard is a fantastic Pennywise, the child actors are convincing and for the most part the cinematic changes are more than acceptable, at the least understandable. However the final face off decides to go ""off book"" and leads into the classic cinematic horror film tropes, which doesn't work with the build up, leaving you incredulous on behalf of the 'tweens'. I found it tense, a few jumps (much to my surprise) and I enjoyed it. I won't say more.

"Interesting visuals, poorly constructed","The film's a tremendous disappointment--especially given the hype. ""It"" is chaotic and unfocused. Mind you, there are some moments that feature truly spectacular visuals, and the film wants to have heart, but it's never scary and the narrative is--at best --picaresque. What's the mystery of Pennywise? The movie doesn't care. Why is Ben being sought out for special attention by town bully Henry Bowers? Forget about it. As a result, there's no real sense of drama, and some of the adult characters are so terribly stereotypical that any scene with a grown-up in it is difficult to watch. I'm crushed. i really hoped that this film would do for horror what Avengers did for Superheroes. That is, I hoped it would signal the start of something really epic. Instead, it felt like flipping through a bunch of movie channels on Oct 31. Sure, you see some scary images, but you just can't seem to care that much about them.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Scary and Enjoyable,"I enjoyed the novel and the original mini-series and of course this only covers the part of the novel and mini-series when the protagonists were kids. But as for me, there is no question that this version is superior (in fact vastly superior) to the mini- series. The locations were great (Port Hope is used for the downtown of the imaginary Derry while most of the film is shot elsewhere in Canada) and the cinematography top notch. The special effects were excellent and scary. Although I suspect most people who see this will have read the book or seen the previous mini-series, I won't spoil your pleasure by giving any of the plot. The acting was very good. All of the young actors were fine. A particular shout out to Jeremy Ray Tayor who plays the overweight kid and really nails the role and to Sophia Lillis who plays the only girl in the group of loser kids and is absolutely great. But all of the kids give excellent performances. I think those were the two hardest roles to pull off well which is why I note them. Bill Skarsgard is a convincing and terrifying clown and Stephen Bogeart as Sophia Lillis's father is almost as creepy. Nicholas Hamilton was convincing as the leader of the bullies to the point where I almost didn't recognize him from his role in Captain Fantastic. All in all some good scares, some excellent acting, a visual treat and I can't wait for part two when the kids are grown up.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
