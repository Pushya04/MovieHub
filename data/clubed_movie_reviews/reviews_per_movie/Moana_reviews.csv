One of the best Disney movies in recent years.,The movie is still one of the best modern Disney movies. Its a real pleasure to watch with the kids. My daughter especially enjoys the Polynesian style and the catchy songs..even when i sing then out of tune. Worth a watch and a revisit from time to time.,8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Beautiful in every sense, Moana will soften even the hardest of hearts","Moana is a return to the classic Disney formula, the clichés and characters ripped from a number of other animated films. However, the pure beauty and skill of the production rises the old story into new heights.Following from the success of Zootropolis, Moana follows a more traditional narrative we know and love; the princess who wishes for something more and is whisked on a supernatural adventure. We know this story so well yet Moana seems fresh and thrilling as if the plot was innovative. Perhaps this is due to the Polynesian setting or the morally ambiguous Maui, played perfectly by Dwayne Johnson, but most likely it is it the simple magic of Disney – the wonder for both children and adults has reached its peak with the perfection of the classic formula. For once, the clichés make the film more enjoyable. The quality of the animation helps too: it's clear they have reached the pinnacle of blending realistic textures with stylised designs, creating an aesthetic beauty that few other companies can match – Disney have mastered water to the point it looks better animated than in real life! Even the music has been perfected here, the annoying catchiness of Frozen's tunes replaced by memorable but effective songs that fit the culture and setting of our adventure. A childlike warmth was awakened in me and many other adult members of the audience as the film brought the emotional highs of the Disney renaissance without the modern subversion of the classic tropes. While Moana sometimes threatens this with pop culture references, the film thankfully keeps to mostly traditional values and morals; a step above many children's animated films released today.Moana is good, old fashioned Disney magic; the traditional narrative and morals updated with stellar animation and an awareness that's effective but never overpowering enough to threaten the integrity of the Disney formula.SWEETVisit https://sweetorsaltedmoviereviews.com/ for more.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
what a delight!,"Wow, what a great great movie! The visuals in this movie are breathtaking!! They are so gorgeous! But, besides the visuals there is such a heart and imagination and creativity to this movie. Moana is such a likable, smart, and relatable person. the voice work for Moana is so sweet and so good. The chemistry between Moana and Maui is so great and so natural. The songs in this movie are so charming, catchy and fun! But, How Far I'll Go is such an emotional song and it has such heart...I dare say I like it a little more than Let It Go! The way Moana sings it and you can feel it!! Wow, I just looved this movie and it is great for kids and adults. I will always love it and I wanna see it again!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Visually beautiful, but problems with plot and characterization cause this movie to stumble.","I have been largely unimpressed with Disney's recent animated movies, and many of my criticisms with them hold true with Moana. Looking back at Wreck-It Ralph, Zootopia, and Frozen, it seems to me that Disney is more interested in building a visually beautiful world than building a great story. This is true with Moana. The animation is wonderful. The world is gorgeous. The story, however, is rather dull and shallow.The world is by design fairly sparse. There aren't a lot of characters in this movie. So to make up for that, the story or the characters need to be particularly compelling. Unfortunately, they aren't.Disney breaks no new ground with Moana's story. That isn't new for Disney, and to be fair, it isn't necessarily a bad thing. Many good movies are just well-done re-imaginings of classic stories. But Moana isn't even that. At every step of the way, I couldn't shake a feeling that I'd seen it all before. The story never gripped me nor did it leave me feeling fulfilled. Thus, the film just feels empty.If either Moana or Maui were engaging characters, this movie could have been good. Despite a good performance from Auli'i Cravalho, Moana had a very small character arc. She was not that different a person at the end of the film than she was at the beginning. For much of the film, she had very little agency of her own. The plot seemed to carry her along, rather than she driving the plot.Maui did everything he could to cause the plot to stall. This could have been great, as his antagonistic attempts to stop the main character could have worked as the central conflict. But since Moana is rarely actually trying to move the plot forward, the conflict just seems to be her-vs-him, which is mildly interesting at best.It's a shame. Moana could have been such a good movie. But it suffers from the same failings as most recent Disney animated ventures: wonderfully crafted world without a story worthy of that world.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

I know that chicken ... I voted for him .... TWICE!,"Instant classic.Easily ranks among the best from the Disney Studio, and a very worthy successor to Mulan 1998, a similar story equally well done.Oddly also seems to be best work ever from Dwayne Johnson, perhaps not the first name I would have associated with ""voice acting,"" but a star turn nonetheless.If you want to be picky -- which is the reviewer's job, after all -- the momentum slows a little at the top of the third act, but the ultimate themes of redemption, forgiveness and self-discovery at the finale are an absolute joy.As they used to say, ""for children of all ages.""((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

"When it comes to sheer entertainment value and visual beauty, 'Moana' knocks it out of the park","Despite being a lifelong Disney fan, that is not to say that everything they've done is great. They've done many classics, their best revolutionary, though they had hit and miss periods in the 80s and the 2000s.'Enchanted' and 'The Princess and the Frog' saw a return to form, while the likes of 'Tangled', 'Wreck It Ralph', 'Zootropolis' (aka 'Zootopia') and 'Frozen' were even better and there was a lot to like too about 'Big Hero 6'. Of the ""2nd Renaissance""/""Disney Revival"" period, 'Moana' is up there with the best of them and as one of Disney's best in about twenty years.Maybe the momentum dips ever so slightly going into the final act, Maui's change of heart is a touch rushed and for me there was no real point to the pig character that induced more unintentional awkwardness than amusement. It was however difficult to fault 'Moana', because of how many things it did right and how brilliantly the things it did right were executed. There have been criticisms regarding a formulaic story, HeiHei the chicken being irritating and the portrayal of Maui being stereotypical, but these were criticisms that didn't bother me at all.Firstly, the animation is phenomenal. Disney's best-looking film in a long time and one of their best-ever looking films, not just this but perhaps the most visually exquisite animated film this year in a year that also saw 'Your Name', 'Kubo' and 'Zootropolis' and even one of the year's best-looking films. The attention to detail is impossible to fault, whether it's the water, the trees or even Maui's tattoos, while the colours just pop out at you and everything is immaculately detailed with not an ounce of artificiality in the backgrounds, further boasting visually stunning sequences such as the climax, ""We Know the Way"", ""Shiny"" and with the coconut pirates.The soundtrack has garnered a huge amount of praise, and for good reason. Love the evocative orchestration and instrumentation, with its seamless blend of South Pacific Culture, pop and Broadway. Likewise with the songs, which are along with 'Frozen' the best and most consistent set of songs from a Disney film since 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame'. ""How Far I'll Go"" is an ""I want"" sort of song that's infectious, heartfelt and inspiring. ""You're Welcome"" sees Dwayne Johnson showing a quite wide range of emotions through a surprisingly good singing voice. ""Shiny"" is deliciously kooky and like something that David Bowie would be proud of, Jemaine Clement sings the heck out of it. ""We Know the Way"" sends chills up the spine.Scripting-wise, 'Moana' encompassed a wide emotional range within me. There is something for everybody, never too complicated for children and never too childish for adults, tonally it's focused throughout, and it's very witty and thought-provoking. Throughout there are many opportunities to laugh, cry and be inspired. The story is, while not exactly original, beautifully paced and enthralling.The whole Polynesian culture, faith and seafaring traditions included and explored generously but in a way that feels part of the story rather than just thrown in, and while there are elements that reminds one of Disney past and present this feels more affectionate than Disney just running out of ideas. The coconut pirates scene may seem like filler, but instead of being incidental and dull filler it was entertaining and visually dazzling, while the musical numbers bring the storytelling forward and say much about the characters' motivations and the climax is hair-raising.Moana is has now joined the list as one of my favourite female Disney characters, while Maui is a fun, compelling character and the chemistry between the two being a large part of the film's humour and heart. Personally found myself entertained by HeiHei and that his existence and role in the story were justified. If anybody does find him dumb or annoying, this is a rare of those not being bad things for a character clearly intended to be that way from reading up about the film. The voice acting is top notch, with Auli'i Cravalho making a startling debut (voice and singing, goodness she has pipes). Dwayne Johnson, on paper an unlikely and eyebrow-inducing choice, is also splendid, as an actor he's grown a lot, while Alan Tudyk is amusingly zesty and Jemaine Clement bringing gleefully kooky menace.In summary, knocks it out of the park in visual beauty and sheer entertainment value, Disney does it again with their latest classic 'Moana'. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Moana,"From the opening lyrics to the final shot, Moana was a fun glimpse into Polynesian life. Reminds me of Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron with its depiction of tribal peoples, people who depend on the land and environment to live. As one of the several catchy songs say, the island gives them everything they need. No need to go beyond the reef.I'm glad that Moana and Zootopia, Disney's two most recent feature films, humorously refer to the archetypal Disney traits that appear in film after film -- i.e. an animal sidekick, the heroine bursting into song, following your dreams. Even if they do year after year, it never gets old. (... Well, maybe a little bit. I'm actually jaded by the happy ending trope in practically every work of film, literature, etc. out there. But that's beside the point.) Even if you can predict the ending of Moana, it's not quite what you expected. Disney has recently been changing things up a bit and having creative endings. Frozen, for example. Even if they weren't slightly creative, the story still enacts the Disney magic -- the ability to inspire, motivate, uplift, and ultimately enlighten further on mankind's communal desire to go beyond the norm. You don't have to do something amazing to make a name for yourself. It's not the hook that defines you, it's what you do that defines you and makes you who you are. Just don't follow hard tradition all the time. If someone says you can't achieve your dreams, he/she is most likely right. HOWEVER. That's only true if you don't give it your all. Those right now who are living their dreams gave it their all. If it's something you really want, after all, then naturally you'll give it the necessary effort and force of will. It won't be easy; life wasn't meant to be easy.It's not as amazing as Zootopia, but Moana is still a genuinely good Disney movie. It has a superb single, a nice accompanying soundtrack, great characters, sublime animation with crystal- clear attention to detail, and wonderful themes and messages. I admit, I was expecting too much from Moana after seeing Zootopia, which is probably why I give Moana a 9. Zootopia hits the 10. If you haven't seen either one, I recommend seeing Moana first.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Tamatoa,"I give it a 6 for the Tamatoa.He is a very charming villain.Moana and Maui are not very good heroes, and it appears that Disney wants to make men look like fools in all their movies.And that pet animals of Moana are the worst ever made in animations for kids.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
You're Welcome.,"2016 has been a particularly strong year for animated films. With the likes of Zootopia, Finding Dory and Kubo & The Two Strings all vying for best animated picture of the year, it seems Moana deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as well. It's no fluke that out of the four movies I just mentioned, 3 of them belong under the house of the mouse.Legend has it that demigod Maui stole a sacred stone, the heart of the goddess Te Fiti. The lava demon confronted him and both the heart and Maui were lost forever. Now, the world is slowly dying and someone must find the heart and force Maui to put it back. But who is this chosen one? It might be Moana, a Polynesian girl who is suppose to be taking over as chief of her tribe, but longs to sail beyond the reef. Featuring new comer Auli'i Carvalho as Moana and the most electrifying man in sports entertainment, Dwayne 'The Rock"" Johnson, as the demigod Maui.It's not surprising that I found myself tapping my feet to the songs in this film because Lin-Manuel Miranda, creator of Hamilton, shares his talent with this film. I can easily see any one of the songs in this piece going up for and winning Best Original Song, giving the man the O in the prestigious PEGOT award circle. He currently has a Pulitzer, Emmy, Tony and Grammy, among more. The songs here remind me of the old-school Disney songs, easy to listen to, fun to play on repeat and important to the story. At first, I felt it was a little too on the nose with some of the lyrics, but eventually he won me over and I've been listening to the soundtrack ever since.The film itself might lack some of the intricacies of plot heavy films like Zootopia, but this journey story is entertaining and heartfelt. The vibrant colours of the green islands and the blue sea help propel the film above and beyond what some others films have to offer. The animation takes a nice little turn for the creative when the characters find themselves under the sea in a side villains lair. We are treated with some bioluminescent sequences with another catchy tune not far behind.Johnson is stellar as Maui, he seems completely comfortable in a voice acting role and surprisingly has the chops to sing a tune. Newcomer Auli'i Carvalho holds her own against a star like Johnson and she really gives a strong voice to a driven female character. I applaud that Disney didn't feel the need to shoehorn in a love story either. This is a tale about self discovery, not some young woman needing to find a man. Disney nods and respects their past while looking to the future with Moana. Princesses no longer need to be the 'love' goal of a man.Moana is a visually beautiful film with great songs and a strong female lead character. There are some visually gags for the kids and a great time for adults. Moana is a great film.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not really interesting,"The film has a good songs, Moana is so cute i love the clothes, and the chicken is so funny i love it than all of the story actually. Kind of disney film that said follows your heart or something like what makes you is yourself. Somehow, raises some questions in my head like why the ocean choose her after a long time, is that no other people before? And then Maui why he looks so okay alone in a remote island? Why it's needed long time to just pick the boat for him. This fim is not memorable for me, the characters are not deep built. Great graphics i really like the art.

A fun Disney animation without the heart to make it a classic,"At this present moment in time it feels as though Disney has a license to print money and their certainly not stopping anytime soon with countless remakes on the calendar for the next few years and original properties like last year's Xmas time animated hit Moana that are finding instant successes with their target audiences, that will likely see them become family favourites in the present and the years to come.You can almost envision the Disney power players gathered around the table, their eyes lighting up at the pitch of Moana, about kindly and magically gifted young girl (continuing on the Mouse House's recent output of strong willed female heroines) that just so happens to be an Polynesian native (covering off the diversity side of requirements) all the while having a story that's conveniently tailored made too a few song and dance numbers that will have the kids singing and adults wishing they never bought the official soundtrack and you can pretty much guarantee in a few years' time Moana will be hitting a stage near you too live its new life as a feel good audience pleasing stage hit.It really does feel as though Moana owes a lot to past Disney hits like Mulan, The Lion King and recent box office behemoth Frozen and while the island/ocean setting of the story and the addition of everyone's favourite ex-pro wrestler Dwayne Johnson as the voice of Demi-God Maui set's Moana a part from these films, Moana doesn't actually end up delivering anything that fresh or new to the old age staple of young protagonist that doesn't mind being a rebel saving the day after an adventure filled quest and it's a shame that Moana doesn't utilise its ample potential to become anything more than a nice piece of colourful entertainment.Filled with animal sidekicks (crazy eyed chicken Heihei steals the film), the aforementioned musical numbers that are more pleasant that instantly singable and Moana herself who's voiced with a lot of life by rising star Auli'i Cravalho but the film never truly breaks out to join the ranks of classic Disney heroines, Moana as a whole remains constantly middle of the road and you'd be hard pressed to find many that will be mentioning this outing in the future years as Disney unloads more and more similar fair into the great wide world.Final Say –Energetic and sometimes laugh out loud funny, Moana is an audience appeasing event that's tailor made to keep the little tykes content and the senses dazzled but the heart that transforms some Disney films into the instant classics they become is curiously missing here and it stops Moana from being anything but a mostly forgettable diversion.3 evil coconuts out of 5",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Fun Movie (must watch),"Henny's Movie Review: Moana (aka Vaiana)In three words: A Fun Movie.With Pixar dropping the ball lately it is good to see that Disney is picking it up with great movies like, Tangled, Zootopia and now Moana. Yes, they made a mediocre over-hyped movie named Frozen, read my previous review for my thoughts about that movie. Moana really doesn't disappoint it has a good pacing, a great cast, and it is BEAUTIFUL. I could just leave my review at this and tell you to go and watch this movie, but let's see ""How Far I'll Go"".Moana is a story that takes place in Ancient Polynesia, when a curse reaches the island Mata Nui a chieftain's daughter is determined to go on a journey, to find a demigod named Maui in order to stop the curse.Like most Disney movies this is a coming of age story. Moana is a chieftain's daughter who is struggling with her love for her people and her love for the ocean. She is determined and a strong character. It is wonderful to see her grow and find herself throughout the movie. She is voiced by Auli'I Cravaljo and it fits like a glove, perfect love her accent.Moana is joined by a demigod named Maui. He starts out as an egotistical/funny character but we quickly learn why and see him change for the better. He is voiced by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and if you know The Rock YOU know what to expect. You can never go wrong with The Rock.Other supporting characters were there to setup the plot and exposition.The music, as expected, was typically Disney which is a good thing because I love Disney songs. After the movie you just can't get it out of your head. All the scores were very good. It did the basics like underscoring a scene but it also carried the movie for a huge part.The three-act-structure. Moana has a great beginning, good middle, and a great ending. Furthermore, the pacing of this movie is fast in a good way. It doesn't hold on to a scene for too long and the movie knows when to cut.The cinematography was beautiful it really shows that the creators have done their research. I love the bright colors and gorgeous sceneries. It would appear that Disney's new approach to movie making is starting to pay-off, by remaking their old animated movies into real-life and mocking their old movies with their new 3d-animated movies, they are breathing new life into their movies. As aforementioned in the introduction Moana is a must see movie that won't disappoint.I give this movie a 8.5.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Formulated,"This movie was...pretty good. Its not worthy of an 8.2 average user rating (as of the time of writing this review) though. I don't wanna spoil anything for anyone who hasn't seen the movie yet so I won't go into much detail.First, let me say I don't hate this movie. On a technical level this film is truly remarkable. The animation is gorgeous and some aspects of it are even photorealistic. Dwayne Johnson's voice fits Maui's character very well, and all the other voice actors were good too. Some ideas were really cool like how the water is a character and Maui's tattoos can tell stories. Some of the songs weren't bad, either. Except for that obvious ""Let It Go"" ripoff.My big problem with the movie is its story. Its way too formulaic. I could predict pretty much every major plot point as the film unfolded. If you've ever seen a Disney movie, you know what's going to happen. A character loses something dear to them but it is conveniently restored later. An antagonist has a quirky song number that isn't as catchy or majestic as ones sung by the main characters. There's the quirky sidekick that serves no purpose to the plot besides being useful in one brief moment of one scene. Every character with some flawed personality trait is perfectly resolved. At one point I thought to myself ""we're overdue for a musical number, aren't we?"" and literally 10 seconds after I thought that, a musical number started. I could go on about various aspects that Yes, anyone who's seen the movie will tell you its somewhat self-aware, but recognizing the issue does not change the fact that it still suffers from it.If you wanna see it, feel free to, but don't expect anyone over age 12 to have their mind blown. Yes the animation is amazing and the Polynesian setting is unique for Disney, but the story is one we've seen dozens of times before. 6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of Disney's hidden champions!,"Hi there,I'm not gonna say much other than that I've watched this movie several times now with my young daughter, as she enjoys it so much.

I would imagine most of the folks in the audience now have seen it 3 or 4 times. I served a number of years in the Army in Hawaii, so I was attracted to the movie for that reason, and it was certainly a great movie going experience.

Simply fantastic...,"It is indeed very rare that I toss a top rating at an animated movie, but ""Moana"" definitely deserves that.The storyline in ""Moana"" was quite good and rather thrilling. It is a storyline that appeals to both a younger and older audience, because the story is timeless and has classic elements of good versus evil and the uprising of an unlikely underdog heroine. But it is also the story of friendship, forgiveness and acceptance.Shortly summarized, ""Moana"" is about young Moana whom is the daughter of the chieftain of a dying island. She goes against the edicts of the tribe and sail out beyond the reef to search for a demigod who has the power to set things right.The animation and the art style in ""Moana"" was just spectacular. There was just something very alluring and beautiful to the particular style that was used for this animated movie. And the levels of detail was just bedazzling. There were so many impressive details in every scene, and it looked so very real. I was especially impressed with the hair and the way that they had drawn the characters. Moana was very charismatic, while Maui was lovable.""Moana"" also has some good dialogue that keeps the movie up in a constant beat, well assisted by a good amount of action and storytelling.And while were are on the topic of dialogue, then ""Moana"" had some really good voice acting talents on the cast ensemble. Auli'i Cravalho really did a wonderful job, and she is quite talented. It was also a treat to have Dwayne Johnson do the voice for the demigod Maui. I didn't know that Alan Tudyk also voices a character in this movie.There is a fair amount of singing in this animated movie too, and it actually worked quite well in favor of the movie, for different reasons. The first being that the songs were quite appropriate for the story and fit naturally into the movie. The songs are also quite nicely orchestrated and performed. Usually, I am not overly keen on songs in animated movies, but ""Moana"" did it quite as well as ""The Little Mermaid"" did back in 1989.I was instantly blown away by the comedic element of the chicken that came along on the oceanic journey. That chicken was just downright hilarious and really spiced up the movie quite a lot, pardon the pun.As I mentioned in the start of my review, then it is very rare that I give a top rating for an animated movie, and only have done so once before to ""Epic"". But ""Moana"" ranks up alongside with it, because this is a fantastic animated movie in every sense of the word. I watched it with my family, and we all loved the movie and were very entertained by it.This is definitely an animated movie that is well-worth watching and this is a movie that rightfully belongs in the collection of anyone who enjoys animated movies. And this is an animated movie that you can watch more than just once.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Has it where it counts,"As cynical as I am about Disney movies, I freely admit that I liked ""Moana"" quite a bit. It wasn't exactly a challenge with Dwayne Johnson's involvement, but the elements that are usually a turn-off . . . weren't. The songs are good, the animation's beautiful, and the formulaic heroine with sidekicks really seem to work here.Cynically speaking, Moana is just another princess for the Mouse's stable. Having said that, you could do with a lot worse. She's got the spunk and strong personality to be a winning character, and she really makes this an enjoyable story.I could easily watch this again.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great Animation Movie,"Maui, a demigod, steals the cornerstone of all creation: the heart of Te Fiti, resulting in the slow destruction of the ancient Polynesian islands. Moana, an island chieftain's daughter, must find Maui and set things right.""When you write using a bird's beak, it's called tweeting,"" declares Maui - an ancient demigod who has no business referencing Twitter. His charm is lost on Moana, but in this moment, you realize the kind of goofiness you're in for.The story comes from a Polynesian myth. Goddess Te Fiti creates all life and takes the form of an island. Maui (Dwayne Johnson), a shapeshifting hero, then steals her heart (a piece of glowing rock), bringing a curse upon all the surrounding islands. In the process, he also loses his magical fish hook and is rendered superpower-less. Moana (Auli'i Cravalho), the princess of one such affected island, is chosen by the ocean to find Maui and restore the heart of Te Fiti.On paper, Moana is a quintessential Disney story: there's an aspirational princess; a flawed hero, quirky comic reliefs (a senile grandma, a brainless chicken); the promise of a happy ending and most importantly, the golden message of chasing what your heart desires.It's a narrative triumph, which is ironic, because the central idea itself is unoriginal to the core. One can't help but wonder: will we ever experience journey-away-from-home-to-find-metaphorical-treasures fatigue in animated films? You find big spoonfuls or tiny traces of it in almost all modern animation classics from Finding Nemo to Up to Inside Out, and Moana makes no efforts to take any detours.However, the movie chugs along with breathtaking animation, adorable interactions between the strong-willed girl and the hilariously self-obsessed demigod, and songs that make you shimmy involuntarily. There's even a Mad Max: Fury Road-inspired battle scene.Moana literally means 'the ocean' and as the heroine conquers her namesake, she also conquers your heart. You won't regret setting sail and voyaging with her.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Tangled joins Kung Fu Panda to save the environment,"There's a theory that in this world there is only a handful of truly original stories, first told ages ago, and the rest is just a combination and a rehash of those. Well, I'm not sure about the whole entirety, but the story of Moana definitely sounds kinda familiar. ""Sounds"" being not just metaphorical, hehehe.In case you want your details and explanations dry, it's a story of two persons who join forces to overcome a greater evil, discovering their true selves along the way. Sounds indeed familiar. Right, because every other story out there, from Luke Skywalker to Jason Bourne, is about fighting evil and self-discovery. But is it a curse or a blessing in disguise? After all, being familiar doesn't necessarily mean being boring. And it's the details of the particular implementation that make all the difference.Speaking of details, it's simply impossible not to fall in love with Moana, that's how beautifully this film is drawn. The lush colors, the beautiful landscapes and the sea, the adorable characters - everything here is an eye candy. Add some decent (albeit slightly lacking variety) singing and a cute and vigorous young heroine - and you've gotten yourself another Tangled, this time without the castle and blonde hair but with tropical islands and catamarans to compensate for it.But while this film is undoubtedly a joy to watch, it falls just a little short of becoming a real hit. Probably because, unlike his latest predecessors, it didn't bring into the genre anything fresh. Tangled was the first really successful animated musical in decades. Frozen built on that success and redeveloped the world of fairy tales into a place where girls can actually take the lead. And while Moana has all the strong points of its older sisters, giving us just that is not entirely satisfying. Which doesn't mean that you won't have fun watching it, but the chances that Moana will win a permanent spot in your heart and memory are fairly slim.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Anyway, you will see pacific customs and a rebel princess and she has some dark moments and some wisdom and of course everything will turn out alright. The Disney script is pretty much known.I guess children would like it up until a certain age but more so if you have girls obviously.

Powerful.,"I LOVE this film. Unlike most Disney female leads we have had in the past, Moana is a leader. She is strong and brave. This film did not need a love interest despite it having a female lead which is quite refreshing.

Another entry in Disney's line of tourism commercials,"Just like ""Brave"" and ""Frozen"", this movie feels like a tourism ad for a substantial part of the time (and indeed, Disney partnered with Hawaiian Airlines to promote the movie, despite its ecological message), but delivers some decent plot and character development in between, alongside the usual stunning animation.

Mocking the craft does not excuse following it.,"MOANA - 2016Directed by Ron Clements and John MuskerStarring Auli'i Cravalho and Dwayne JohnsonPlot Overview: ​When darkness begins to envelope her land, next in line to be chief, Moana(Auli'i Cravalho), rebels her father's wishes and sets sail across the ocean to awake Demi-God, Maui(Dwayne Johnson) and return the heart of Te Fiti to where it was stolen from.I've heard people call this movie one of the best Disney animated movies and while it is certainly good, I personally think it's one of the weaker entries to the new Renaissance. Again, it is certainly good and it contains some qualities which I really like and hope are expanded upon but it's just not up to the quality of Zootopia, Wreck it Ralph, Big Hero 6 or - heck - even Frozen, as much as I've grown a distinct distaste for that film. Let me break my disappointment with this film down, step by step.Firstly, the plot. As much as I really like the idea of mocking common Disney tropes, the film still follows them tropes and that makes the 'self aware' statement feel redundant. I'm all up for a new self- aware Disney but commit to change, don't dip your toes in the water. Even after that, the plot is pretty clichéd and weak. I think calling it a buddy adventure film is a good place to start but it just feels so disjointed and so much of it feels like filler. And I absolutely despise the ending. It is 100% a cop out and they clearly just wanted to rap it up quickly.Character and voice acting. Auli'i Cravalho was good as Moana and she can definitely sing. Moana is a very strong contender for Disney princesses. She is independent, kinda interesting and has a strong will; she is a very solid character and I am happy with her overall arc.I love Dwayne Johnson. He may not be a great actor but he sure is likable and insanely charismatic. He will be king of the world some day but, for the love of God, he cannot sing. He CAN NOT SING! As a voice actor: sure he was passable. As a singer: he is the Antichrist. Anyway, as a character, Mauii was a completely average Disney sidekick. He seems to be imitating(to a certain degree) Robin Williams' iconic genie and I'll say it here and now, he doesn't live up to him.The villains in the movie were very weak. Some people argue that there aren't any but I disagree. The bandit things were certainly enemies(with no explained motivation mind you) and the Fire God was a villain for a short time. Both of these characters were uninteresting and boring.Every Disney princess has a sidekick, yes? Yes. And I will happily say, Moana has possibly one of the worst. Hei Hei is such a useless, pointless joke of a sidekick that I cannot believe he was green-lit. His mere existence is a joke and that is REALLY annoying. Put thought into your sidekicks Disney!The animation was stunning. It looked amazing and I really commend the animation department. We have water effects nearly on par with 'The Good Dinosaur' and really creative and inventive character design and visuals. The cinematography and editing were both pretty good.I laughed at quite a few jokes but nothing on par with Aladdin or whatnot. The emotional payoff with her grandma was very touching and emotional and I am genuinely impressed with how they handled it.As for music, I like the song 'How Far I'll Go' but they use it THREE times and that just makes the song hard to listen to. I hate every other song in the music, especially Johnson's and that god damn crab(screw that crab!).In conclusion, I recommend this movie but I definitely think it is one of the weaker entries to the new Renaissance. You should see it but I wouldn't expect cinematic gold. I'll rate Moana 6 Crab Solos out of 10!",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Simply amazing,"This film is an epic in the truest sense and easily one of Disney's best ""Big Films"".It follows the classic ""quest"" type story of a girl growing up feeling she's destined for more than her quiet life and eventually finding she's the chosen one to go on a mission to save the world, but how it gets there is awe inspiring.The animation is second to none, at one point I had to do a double take that they didn't mix in a live action character. Thinking back to the original Toy Story, things have certainly come far.Unlike other Disney movies (and most movies in fact), Moana is perfectly capable of pursuing her goals completely by herself and doesn't have a love interest, which I think may be a first for a Disney film (it's actually a lot closer to a Miyazaki film in the way the hero is portrayed).The soundtrack is also exceptional, so much so that my 5 year old girl made me order the album after the film. The entire score evokes a sense of adventure and riding over the waves and is simply sublime.To sum up how good this film is, it was the second movie in which I've ever witnessed the theatre audience erupting into a round of applause when the credits rolled (the first was Interstellar).The movie no doubt has some flaws, but I'm giving it a 10 to balance out some unreasonably negative reviews on here, some of which read like they were written by people who have no seen the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Beautiful animation, predictable storyline","A friend and I went with the kids to watch Moana last night. I loved seeing Polynesian islands in animation again. The scenery is beautiful--much more of it, and more vivid compared to Lilo and Stitch. The storyline was typical Disney, of course. I feel like I've seen this movie a dozen times before. I would add that I am getting tired of seeing male characters portrayed as cowardly, ignorant, and/or irresponsible. This movie succeeds in that aspect, which is disappointing. Having sons, it would be nice to see a movie where a young man is the hero. Instead, we seem to find thattoo many of Disney's children's movies feature a heroine with weak male characters around her. Other than the above-mentioned observation and the glorifying of pagan belief systems, it was an entertaining and uplifting movie.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
I loved it!,"I really appreciated the tribal basis of this animation. I think they should make more of this type of animation and less Disney Princess based ones. Moana was a very well represented cultural animation. I loved the fact that their facial features and body structure were not all lean and straight or small nosed.

Jarring,"It was going to sell...... Mooooaaaanaaa. Moan. Teardrops of pity. Bells and whistles clambering above and behind. It catches you.

The ramifications of this movie, if you didn't know it already was, jellies from the distant aftertaste of 'Frozen' and 'Zootopia.' But this picture, if you didn't know it already was, is meant for Hawain culture, made for that specific statute of sensibility. So it's not that funny, but on a yacht at night, with the stars shining upon thee, without a whistle of wind, but the quiet rest of the open sea, and showing this film, if you didn't know it already was one, being shown on an outside projector, with a tropical drink in one hand and a bloody tissue in the other, then can this movie touch the jolts of my heart. What I am saying is this movie requires a journey for you to enjoy it instead of sitting their with a dried up full bag of large popcorn.",,Anonymous,Animation
Nice movie but...,"This isn't just about Disney; recently, animated movies as a whole seem to have become overly simplistic. While I understand that the primary audience is children, kids' movies used to be far more thought-provoking. This one feels overly basic, with simplistic dialogue and humor. The plot develops in a very obvious way, making the next scene almost always predictable.The backstory was intriguing, and the music was enjoyable, but the film lacked nuance and missed opportunities to create deeper emotional resonance. It overexplained everything, guiding the audience too heavily instead of allowing the story to unfold naturally. A few well-placed pauses or moments of silence could have provided space for viewers to reflect on what had just happened and anticipate what might come next. Not everything needs to be explicitly stated, leaving room for imagination and interpretation would have made the experience far richer.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Absolute excellence by Disney AGAIN !!,"Moana (or Vaiana in my country and many other European countries) is an animated musical adventure directed by John Musker and Ron Clements. It is the second Disney movie this year after the incredible Zootopia that was released back in February, and now I can say it is the second incredible movie released by Disney in 2016. Moana is a very interesting and touching movie about a girl named Moana (Vaiana) who dreams of sailing the world. She is voiced by Auli'i Cravalho who does a fantastic job on the role with her insanely talented voice, singing all the wonderful songs that will very soon be considered as classics. Dwayne Johnson is great (as per usual) as Maui - a legendary shapeshifting demigod. He brings such a fun, lovely, and comforting voice to his character that very few actors can do. And he is great at singing too, which was a surprise for me. It also has great animation, with incredible visuals as we've come to expect in Disney movies nowadays. I truly believe that in this decade, Disney has absolutely taken over the reigns in the film industry, and especially on the animation side of things. With movies like Tangled, Wreck-it Ralph, Frozen, Big Hero 6, Zootopia and now Moana, Disney shows no sign of stopping in their road to greatness and taking over the world.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

The first 2/3 of it are just frantic, predictable cultural jokes, and near the end it becomes an awkward mix between true romance/drama and slapstick heroism with the standard-issue 2015/2016 females lead cliché (Ghostbusters, Maleficient, Frozen, Star Wars, X-Men, etc.). Don't be fooled by the long list of great reviews here...they are not reviews they are indications of low class of the writers who compensate for their inadequacies.

"Disappointing, annoying and mean-spirited characters, formulaic","I had high hopes for Moana. A Disney film about a brave and fun Samoan-ish girl? What could be better? Moana started off strong. The beginning was interesting, with nice-looking characters and beautiful animation.But by the time they got to the demigod Maui, the film really went downhill. Maui is simply obnoxious. The interplay being the arrogant demigod and the ""brave"" Moana was just irritating and stupid. I didn't want to root for either character.It's 2017, filmmakers. Do you STILL need to drive in Title IX on such a superficial, patronizing level? I've been seeing girls kick ass my whole life (Disney's original Beauty & the Beast, anyone?), so I don't need filmmakers to drive it in more, in the most vapid way.Disney feels guilty for giving films to so many blond ""princesses,"" like Cinderella, Aurora, etc. It's gone to black with Tiana, and Asian with Mulan (stereotypical-looking), and now, it's moving on, probably for the first time, to the Pacific Islands/Polynesia. Pseudo-Samoans need their chance, too.I did notice in the film how ""realistic"" the characters' build, legs, and body types were. Looks like they modeled the demigod, physically, after Dwayne Johnson, who voiced the character. And the credits did show that Disney consulted with a few official Samoan or Polynesian ""experts"" - college professors, maybe? Writers and thought leaders? Looks like Disney's doing its job, diligently trying to portray Polynesian characters realistically and non-stereotypically. Would they give so much thought to Asian characters? I don't know.The film is just kind of dumb and superficial. They made the poor ugly chicken a scapegoat and comic relief. Moana's heroic dad is portrayed as a really handsome, buff guy. But the arrogant, annoying demigod is uglier, with a big but awkward build. Disney thinks good people are handsome/beautiful, and bad people are ugly. Disney itself made Beauty and the Beast, which drives in the fact that beauty is only skin deep, and the fabulous Belle learned to love a Beast. Stop being contradictory and hypocritical, Disney!The ending of Moana was an insipid disappointment, too. They had a demonic sea monstress turn into some earth mother loving green thing. O-kay! Very painful to watch. I thought Disney was master of animation and story, but they were really lacking this time around. The child-ish fiascos between Moana and the demigod are painful to remember - them throwing her precious green stone into the water, her jumping into the water and out? It would only appeal to young children.Get Moana out of my mind! Disney could've done a good job with their first(?) Samoan-ish run, but they didn't do a good job with it.",,Anonymous,Animation

"Looks great, less fufilling","Another film I watched while with my fiance that she picked out to watch. It was not bad and had its interesting moments and it was really nice to look at, but how many more of these messed up plot movies are we going to get? I guess a whole hell of a lot considering you smack Disney on anything and it does spectacular even when we get a story and a world where I cannot tell when things are supposed to be occurring or why things are occurring.The story has a young girl who really wants to go sailing and imagines really peppy songs while her ancestors are shown sailing. There is something about a dude who steals a jewel from an island and has a magic fishhook that allows him to be anything he wants and not sure when this happens. An older woman telling the story suggests that it happened long ago, but Maui whose power is reliant on the fishhook hasn't aged a bit since that happened. He also has tattoos that move and are supposed to be funny, but they generally miss the mark. He joins the main character Moana to return the jewel to the island and meet all sorts of strange things that are never really explained thoroughly.The film looks good and there are some funny moments and even a few catchy songs, but the story is so weak. Another in a long line of girls can do everything a guy can and be the hero, of course, in real life testosterone plays a factor and guys generally are stronger so that is why up to political correctness time men were the main protagonist in stories. Sorry, but no matter what you do, can't change biology. The demigod, Maui, of course is a lumbering oaf who does more hindering than helping, but at least he wasn't the bad guy, well I guess he sort of was...So, a very pretty film to look at, you get a few catchy tunes, but you also get the same thing we have seen in quite a few Disney films lately. Female protagonist, doofus male sidekick and a twist at the end you will see for miles before it is revealed. I'm glad Marvel has some control over its section and is hands on with the material, I do believe it is the only thing keeping those movies really good.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Checks out, but with some missteps","Moana is a (thankfully) non-Americanized cultural piece surrounding islander mythos, very reminiscent of old Disney, capitalizing on their phenomenal animation and with an unforgettable musical piece; ""You're welcome"" is perhaps one of the best songs I've seen in these, which is amazing considering it was sang by an A-list celebrity and not an actual artist, and in a child's movie no less.The idea of an animated tattoo, and a hubris-filled demigod that seeks to appease the people but who's own ego impedes story progression and conflicts with Moana is actually great, however it was brief and without a moving character ark: Maui is an under-exploited plot device throughout the film, and the main character Moana fails to bring more than superficial charm as her character, even if it was done with class. Simply put, Moana is not intrinsically interesting, and the character is moved along largely by a variety of convenient occurrences.Despite attempts made at worldbuilding and storytelling, it lacks depth and thus can't fully achieve excellence, and this is countered in tandem by plot holes, plot armor, and incomplete character development.That all being said, it is visually stunning, entertaining, and as said prior, captivating in its musical pieces and premise.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Disney gem.,"With a strong female lead Moana is a story with great songs and even greater visuals. In the colorful environment Moana is joined by Maui, who is expertly casted as Dwayne Johnson. The Cultures from the New Zealand area is shown in the story with respect, most of the voice actors are in fact from the New Zealand area. Unfortunately it is not flawless. One of the first challenges the two must overcome, I found a bit useless. And I did not care for the cave scene and song. However I understand why it was used. I would definitely recommend the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Poor representation of Polonesian culture,"I was born in Maui, lived there for 13 years and my sister is named Moana. Growing up I heard many legends about the Hawaiian hero Maui, many many legends and ANY of them would have made a better plot for this film.This is an example of an actual legend that has been Disneypulated into a pile of cliché plot twists in a tale that is nothing like any Hawaiian legend you have ever heard.The music is awful and more African than Polonesian. Auli'i Cravalho is the only singer with talent, and unfortunately for her the songwriter was super lame. Lame lame lame lame. I can't say lame enough when it comes to the music. They did not try.The antagonist was horribly underdeveloped. They just gave up I guess.Jemaine Clement's cameo was a disappointment, the best actor given the smallest role and a lame song to boot. Love him in Flight of the Concords, hate him in this movie.Worst of all was the use of the encouraging phrase, ""OK now go save the world!"" as if the writers are making fun of how cliché their own plot is.Lastly we come to Maui himself. It's obvious the references used for the character were not the images from actual Hawaiian legends. No, instead the reference was Bruddah Iz! Yes, the immensely obese and recently deceased Ukelele player. Sure, why not?! I can't say I have ever respected Dwayne the Rock as an actor either, Vin Diesel would have been way better.I conclude that this movie sucks Pele's cha cha.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Didn't push the boat out (ironically),"Moana is a truly stunning setting in ancient Polynesia with its dotting of paradisiacal islands and islets and seafaring people living in reverential tandem with nature. Disney employed the genius of ""Hamilton"" creator Lin-Manuel Miranda in the writing the lyrics and music of some of the tracks. The film's producers went on research trips to Fiji, Samoa, and Tahiti in 2012 to learn about Polynesian culture for the film's research and development.They were surprised to learn that the people of Polynesia abruptly stopped making long-distance voyages some three thousand years ago. Polynesian navigational traditions long predate European explorers (which had begun around 300 CE). This is a theme used in the film's plot.The film itself starts strong, we get an initial sense of the Polynesian people of Motanui, the cultural and traditional mores, their ways of living and organising, and the reasons they are fearful of voyaging out beyond the reef. The transition from Moana's youth to young adulthood is done masterfully, but we leave the islanders behind perhaps a little too quickly, a whole culture and microcosm to be relished more than it was.The plot progresses and does not amount to anything particularly groundbreaking in animated storytelling; coming across as sorely formulaic. If anything, it follows the very boring prescribed arc structure of a traditional corporate storyboard; rising action, climax, and conclusion. It doesn't deviate much from that. A lack of plot twists, intelligent humour, and ultimately creative risk-taking - holds it back from achieving greatness. It's careful to not offend, it's careful to please its target audience to rake in the projected millions. Because of this, Moana cannot ascend to classic status, as seen with many films of the golden age of Pixar for example (1995-2004). Moana's music is average at best with the one notable exception of the anthem ""How Far I'll Go"".In conclusion, the plot and music is average. The setting is above average. I was left feeling the film, despite its good looks and outward charm, felt relatively flat and underdeveloped; more gags, twists, and surprises could have been threaded into the fabric of the story. It felt textbook, as if lifted from an initial storyboard sketch up.Ironically, like a key motif of the plot itself, this film wasn't able to really push the boat (or catamaran) out.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of my favourite disney movies,"Moana has been our ""Corona""- comfort movie in our family. So we watched it a lot in 2020 and 2021. Since then not so much, but last night we felt like it again - and my daughters and I took a bag of chips and some chocolate and enjoyed the time together with this movie.I love the story and the main character. And I love a lot, that in this movie it's not about a love interest, but about selv love. I feel that the message about knowing who you are - despite what other people do to you - is so important. Also, that when people hurt you, they often don't do it because they don't like you, but because they have good intentions.But it also shows, that sometimes you can't heal yourself. Sometimes you need other people in order to heal.The music is awesome - and we can sing along all of the songs, which makes it an even more special experience in our family.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Review for Moana,"This is a movie that my wife, Jaime, has seen multiple times. I know I've sat through a few scenes here and there. She decided to put this on since our daughter has a toy that plays music and tells the story of this film. We were hoping she would sit still and enjoy it with us. She does for the musical numbers.What I'll say is that this is a cute movie. We have our lead character, Moana (voiced by Auli'I Cravalho), who is the daughter of the village chief. They're grooming her to take over, but she's had the adventurer's spirit from childhood. Her Gramma Tala (voiced by Rachel House) encourages it. We learn later due to her father being the same way before he settled into his role as the leader. What gets revealed though, is that they are from a tribe of explorers.Something hooked me in was the mythology. Moana searches for a demi-god named Maui (voiced by Dwayne Johnson). He has a list of accomplishments, but also started the trouble of stealing the heart of Te Fiti. This caused a lava monster named Te Kä to wake up. Its anger is spreading across the sea and affecting the islands. Maui is a shapeshifter and is mischievous. He is also a wayfinder who has a magical hook given to him by the gods. This duo must stop what he did before it is too late.Like I said, I'm a big fan of mythology so seeing Polynesia version to explain the world around them is great. It seems that Maui to them is a combination of Loki and Prometheus. Which fascinates me the distance between where these deities were worshiped. I'd bet that there are others. Then seeing them go below the sea to the world of monsters is great as well, especially with the character of Tamatoa (voiced by Jemaine Clement).I thought that this was well-made as well. The voice acting and the singing are great across the board. The animation is on point. I love bringing all these things to life. Despite the hate it might get, I love the representation here for people and beliefs different from my own. This is a cute little film that I had fun watching. I'd recommend it, especially if you have children.My Rating: 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A by-the-numbers epic where nothing happens. Fantastic songs.,"I have seen Moana five times. Each time I am captivated by the first half hour. Around the time they get to the giant crab hoarder Tamatoa, the movie runs out of steam and I remember the every last bit of the story. This is easy because there are no details left at that point before the film whimpers through its underrated finale.There are great themes here, suitable for all ages. This ""princess"" movie should especially be seen by young girls. Disney seems especially good these days at developing female leads that are full of defiance and motivation. The older men are stodgy and fail to make the best decisions on their own. It is nice to see a female take command and not be defined by her relationship with a love interest.In fact, I say nothing really happens in Moana, and I mean it. Albeit, sort of in a good way. I There is no love story of any kind. Not too long ago, the story of Moana would have ended with her falling in love with yhr only other male character who isnt her dad
And ""ick"" at that thought. I am not sure Moana would pass the Bechdel test, as the only female characters are Moana and her grandmother and they only have Moana's father as a talking point, but in this case I would let it slide. The film is well intentioned. I especially love the archetype of the bull-headed prototypcal man being portrayed as an over-artogant fool. The song ""You're Welcome"" flips the script on songs that that are lists of things worth thanking, and Maui takes unwarranted credit for everything. It might as well be called ""The Mansplaining Anthem.""The music is filled with a lot of the best melodies ever. It's a shame that all of the memorable songs are front-loaded into the first half. Besides ""You're Welcome"", there is the Oscar nominated, ""How Far I'll Go"" and my personal favorite, ""Who You Are."" When I hear that l, it is literally impossible not to hum along with Moana's countermelodic responses.""We share everything we make.We joke and we weave our baskets.The fishermen come back from the sea.""
""I wanna see - ""Give this team an Oscar.For something that seems like something Lin-Manuel Miranda did for Disney as a short-sighted favor, the music here is is way better than it has any right to be. This would make a great Broadway musical, albeit one with only two characters and five real songs.The animation is serviceable, but nothing beyond what we expected in 2016. The water and lava effects are astounding, but I am always surprised by how goodwater and fire effects look in pretty much every CGI animated movie. The struggle between Moana and the volcano goddess is a visual treat and is worth the price of admission.As of me writing this The sequel was released to tepid reviews. This doesn't surprise me. There are no hooks left in the thread bare story that I wished were further explored. Next on the schedule isn't Moana sequel but a live action Remake. Mayve this one will be Disney's least necessary yet.Moana is a movie best suited as a 25 minute Disney attraction. Kids should see it, and the songs are keepers.7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A refreshing experience.,"Moana is a story about a young woman who is called to the sea and leaves her home to save her island.Visually gorgeous, with its water effects and lighting being the highlight. Polynesian culture is shown beautifully here with so much love and attention for detail.The main cast is small but both characters are full of personality and the voice acting is perfect. You can't mention this movie without its excellent soundtrack! Thanks to a wonderful voice cast.The only issue I have with the movie is one song just doesn't feel very well composed like it's only there for the meme and it affects the pacing.Moana is a beautifully animated film with a strong story and fun characters with plenty of laughs to go around.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Well-crafted but slightly disappointing movie,"It is a well-crafted movie from Disney that introduced some Polynesian culture to me. The whole story line is standard, but there were some humorous scenes here and there which kept me very engaged.There are lots of songs in the movie. It might be a trend from Frozen since both have a princess as the leading character. However, I am a little disappointed about the quality of the songs, especially considering the involvement of Lin-Manuel Miranda who created Hamilton, a masterpiece.I am little confused about the ability of the ocean. It is not consistent at all. It left me wondering why doesn't the ocean directly spray water all over the Te Ka?",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Fantastic Musical,"Disney have made some undoubtedly great films since the turn of the century, but with the notable exception of Tangled, their musicals have been a bit hit or miss. But with that said, wow is this a hit. All of these songs are just absolute bangers. 'How Far I'll Go' is beautiful, 'Shiny' is obviously iconic, the opening song is a fun introduction to the film and even 'You're Welcome' is an enjoyable time. This might just be the best Disney soundtrack since Hunchback, or at a push The Lion King, it's that good. Moana is a really well developed character, the animation is beautiful to look at and the ending wraps all of the character arcs and the main story up perfectly. All of the side characters are loveable and enjoyable, with Maui and Tamatoa being my personal favourites. The actual musical score is fantastic, the performances are solid - I just love so much of this film. As far as negatives go, some of the slapstick fell a bit flat, and I was kind of annoyed at the main-characters-splitting-up-before-the-climax trope that was used here. But still, just a fantastic film, and definitely one I'd recommend.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fairly Generic Disney,"It's nice to see a spunky female heroine of color at the center of a Disney film, and it's also nice that the story doesn't remotely involve her falling in love with anyone by the film's end, but this movie still couldn't completely shake off its patina of generic Disney message.The animation is pretty, the music is forgettable (with the exception of the rousing Oscar-nominated anthem ""How Far I'll Go""), and the story is moderately engrossing. This was nominated for Best Animated Feature at the 2016 Academy Awards, but it's no where nearly at the same level as some of its co-nominees, namely ""Kubo and the Two Strings"" and my personal favorite, ""The Red Turtle.""Grade: B",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A beautiful movie but not exactly ground-breaking,"Another wonderful movie to add to the Disney classics.The film stars the daughter of a chief who sets of on journey to save her island. She journeys to find Maui, a mischievous block of tattooed muscles, I mean demigod, to help her save the world. They bond, fight, laugh and save the world with the help of the dumbest chicken you have ever met.The film doesn't exactly break boundaries, break from its typical story lines, explore mature themes or entertain adults the same way it can children. There are a lot animations that do this and Moana isn't one of them. I think this is the main reason people can't appreciate Moana. But WOW! It certainly leaves you feeling all chipper and sing-songy.It's an utterly beautiful, light hearted (with an occasional tear jerker) and humorous film. If you don't like Frozen, Big Hero 6 or Finding Dory please don't watch. This is a movie I will recommend to anyone and everyone because its definitely in Disneys top 10 out of what...like 200 films.For people who are complaining about plot and character dev. Please stop. Disney has worked to the bone to avoid cultural appropriation and misrepresentation whilst offering a visually stunning, humorous and adventurous plot. Sorry, if they didn't include that plot twist you were salivating for.Its get 10/10 instead 9/10 because I enjoyed this movie too much.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
It could of been better,"I enjoyed this movie a lot. The only problem was it had way too many musicals & singing. The movie would start getting interesting and then they would cut it off & start singing. This was a huge disappointment. I think it's OK to have a few musicals in a movie, but no more than 3. This movie had so many & it became annoying.However, the graphics and storyline was great. It would be nice to see a second movie come out but less musicals in the movie. My kids also enjoyed watching it. I thought Disney did a great job with all the characters also. I loved Dwayne Johnson in this movie. Great job!!",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Reminder of all the Good there is in the World,"I find the concept of originality significant in most things in life. Everyone should be aware that this is somewhat of a fallacy in the world of movies as the basic principles of all stories have overlapping similarities. For something to be truly original, it needs to fundamentally change the basics of what has been established in storytelling.Moana does not reinvent storytelling as seldom few movies ever will. In fact, it hinges on the Disney formula that we all know. But what it does do is take all the greatest aspects of amazing or significant movies and brings them together to create a remarkably coherent, funny, sad, empathetic, and heartwarming experience. And by doing so, it taps into a sea of emotion.There were so many aspects of so many different films that I felt this movie drew from. Mulan, Pocahontas, The Emperor's New Groove, Hercules, The Little Mermaid, Zootopia, Finding Dory, Kubo and the Two Strings, Lilo & Stitch, Frozen (in a good way), even The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker although that's a game. All of these came to mind and seemed to inspire Moana in a way that I never expected or ever thought was possible, and that's just to name a few. I'm sure there's more that could easily be put on the list. And that's just part of what made it feel so special. That's not to say it didn't have its own originality either because it did. But by taking a little bit from a lot of different things, it turned it all into something it could call its own.It's not perfect as nothing is. But the flaws that it has diminish very little from the overall journey. So much so that I forgot what parts I disliked after the credits rolled.I'm sure people will disagree and feel that it was ""just another Disney story"" and that ""it's all been done a million times before"" because to be fair, it's somewhat true. It has all been done a million times and it IS just another Disney story. But what made it different to me was the fact that it remained enjoyable throughout almost the entirety of the film, never once felt like it lost its purpose, and kept me engaged with the desires and actions of the characters. It remained true to itself, and to its audience. And on top of all that, it pushed the boundaries yet again on how visually stunning animated movies have gotten year after year.I think the most important thing was how it tapped into a part of myself that has changed over the years due to the nature of growing up, and I hope it does the same for other people. Everyone who grew up watching animated movies at a young age, 2D or 3D, is getting older and usually hides a special part of themselves that existed when they were younger. Very few things have the power to bring us back to a time where we enjoyed so much and had so little to worry about. I don't mean this in a strictly nostalgic way although it's hard to phrase it otherwise. It was more the aspect of being reminded that there are still simplicities in life that we overlook, like something as simple as being alive at a time in history where watching an animated film that took thousands of hours to create by hundreds more people is possible. Even with money as the basis for most everything which is created, this did not feel like a cash-in just to capitalize on children, voice actors, or traditional nostalgia despite all that's been said. That's what made it feel genuinely remarkable.Moana was an experience that I won't forget.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Just average,I took my grand daughters to see this Disney film hoping it would be good. It was just average with forgettable songs and a forgettable hero. They created a reasonable back story but the execution and dialog just lagged. One of my grand daughters fidgeted the entire movie out of boredom. The ending is the only thing that redeemed the movie from total disaster. Disney really should have done better with this film. They seem to have trouble when their not dealing with an already created fairy tale. I will have to say that the animation was stellar as usual which made the lack of story and character engagement the more sad. I guess they might sell a few toys but Moana in not a princess that young girls are going to remember.,6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Please Stop Singing,"Another typical Disney movie of princess, magic, spells, curses, and CONFUSION. I wont spoil it but if you like musical girlie types like FRozen then you'll probably love this. Otherwise, trust me you will be like whats going on? Why is this taking so long? get to the point already. It just drags and drags and drags. It is also somewhat predicable..you'll see what i mean if you go see this. But i HIGHLY recommend you Don't waste your time and money on this movie. If you really want to see it that bad..wait for the DVD...trust me it isn't worth it. At one point in the movie even The Rock says please stop singing. Two good things i can say.

"Emotional Journey, Authentic and Eye Candy AF","As a Polynesian, there are principles and values that are central to our culture that for many years I've tried to share with anyone I meet. Actually many people from Hawaii and the Pacific get this, even non-Polys :-). This story by Disney really brought many of those values out to the larger screen, to a larger audience, and I didn't realize seeing it this way would affect me so... deeply. When baby Moana first stepped onto that beach in the early part of the movie... flower in her hair, sun kissed skin... ""the feels"" are an understatement. My sister and I shed a few tears as if we were seeing a reflection of our own childhood on a beach in Hawaii -- the happiness, the curiosity, the innocence,the sea. Yeah, the feels happened and it was GREAT.The story of the Polynesians voyaging across the Pacific; the sense of ohana and family; how important coconuts are to island life; how the island provides all you need; sense of duty to go out and seek solutions and bring them home; chickens and pigs all over the place (!); the beautiful and varied languages; the dancing; the art and craft of the tapestries (tapa/kapa cloth) and other designs; the canoe designs; the laughing; the relationship with the ocean.... these are all real things we as Pacific Islanders feel in a beautiful, unique life. One great example of authenticity: I also loved that instead of handshakes or just hugs as a greeting in the movie, Disney used the honi, a traditional Polynesian greeting which I recommend to everyone! The honi is a Polynesian greeting in which two people greet each other by pressing noses and inhaling at the same time. This is a very special as it represents the exchange of ha--the breath of life, and mana--spiritual power between two people.This was a well done movie. Breathtakingly beautiful... and actually not so far off from reality (anyone who's been to Tahiti or Samoa will get it). Disney deserves credit for bringing so much joy and pride to a people that are often associated with tikis and grass skirts... We are so much more, and the story told is a great start to learn more deeply and authentically, in my opinion.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Exceptional...though the songs are only okay.,"""Moana"" is the latest full length animated film from Disney and it's a worthy successor to its last CGI success, ""Zootopia"". While the film isn't perfect, it is very enjoyable and original.The story in ""Moana"" is based y loosely on Polynesian folklorein particular, their trickster demigod, Maui (Dwayne Johnson). Because of Maui's actions, nature is very slowly dying off and ruin is coming for Moana and her people. However, Moana's father, the Chief, is afraid of what lies beyond their island and forbids Moana from leaving on a journey to try to restore the lost heart to the Island Mother. Using pluck and determination, and with a bit of help from Maui, Moana makes this journey.This synopsis might sound very strange and confusingand it's best you just see the film for yourself. Suffice to say, it is a real crowd pleaser due to an interesting, stunning computer animation and very original story as well as some interesting characters. I particularly liked Moana as she was strong and likableand not someone needing rescuing. But she also wasn't harsh or stereotypicaljust determined. I also loved her pet sidekick, as this chicken is nothing like any Disney sidekickand you'll soon realize this animal is possibly the dumbest in Disney historyas well as very funny.. As for Dwayne Johnson ('The Rock') he was also very goodand I was surprised that he had a decent singing voice in the film. As for the singing in general, however, this is the weakest aspect of the film. While most of the songs are enjoyable, a few are quite forgettable and none have that singability you look for in a full-length Disney cartoon. You'll almost certainly not be singing or humming the tunes once the film has concluded.Finally, I'd like to point out that I really loved the look of the film. I've visited the South Pacific and New Zealand and the movie really does a great job of capturing the look and spirit of this part of the world. It's also nice that kids in this part of the world now finally have their own Disney princessone who isn't a carbon copy of other Disney females.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Beautiful Addition to the Disney Library,"Moana is a fantastic movie. I have been looking forward to this movie even since I had heard of its release and I was not disappointed.Directed by Ron Clements and John Musker, the team who brought us the Little Mermaid and Aladdin, Moana tells the tale of a young Polynesian woman named Moana who feels like she's being called to something out in the great unknown.Not only is the movie gorgeous to look at but the story is strong and the characters are great. Moana is fleshed out, given strengths and weaknesses. We also get to see her overcome her shortcomings and save the day. Moana is voiced by newcomer Auli'i Cravalho who not only did a good job with the acting but also with the singing. Her voice is fantastic! She teams up with Maui, a fallen demi-god, who is voiced by Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson and it's obvious the character was made just for him. While a bit of a braggart, he is very funny and likable.The songs in this movie are also very gorgeous, taking inspiration from Polynesian culture. The songs were written by Opetaia Foai, Mark Macina and Lin-Manuel Miranda of Hamilton fame. They fit with the setting perfectly and the songs are bursting with raw emotion.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves Disney and loves mythology. I cannot recommend it enough.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Another Winner for Disney,"Moana (2016)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Beautiful looking and highly entertaining animated film from Disney tells the story of Moana, a young girl born on an island and who learns of various ocean tales from her grandmother. As a teen, Moana's island comes under a curse so she decides to set out to sea in order to find the Demigod and make things right.I had avoided watching this, although my two-year-old daughter seems to watch it a couple dozen times a day. I finally sat down and watched it with her and it's certainly another winner for Dinsey. There are a lot of great things about this picture but what I enjoyed most was the actual look of the film.I thought the visual quality was amazing and it really does seem as if the company keeps getting better with each new film. I really loved the vivid colors as they really jump off the screen with their beauty. The majority of the film takes place at sea and I really loved the colorful look of the ocean. The scenes on the various islands are also great to look at.The film also works perfectly as an adventure and that's made even better because the Moana character is so much fun. Being able to go on the adventure with her was a lot of fun and I thought the various battles she has to face were a lot of fun. The Lava Monster was brilliantly designed and certainly made for more fun. Then you've got the Maui character voiced by Dwayne Johnson. Both MOana and Maui add up to one of the more entertaining Disney duos in recent years.The vocal performances are all extremely good and for the most part all of the characters are great. The one exception would be the ""dumb chicken"" who I just didn't find to be entertaining or at least not up to the level of everyone else. Tee song and music numbers are all catchy and quite good as well. Throw in some nice laughs and MOANA really is another winner for the company.",,Anonymous,Animation
Fun follow-your-dreams-empowerment Disney adventure flick,"Disney princesses have changed a lot since the company started pumping them out. In the case of Moana, the daughter of a village chieftain is strong, brave, athletic, and determined to save the world. She also denies being a princess altogether, although in one of the film's occasional Disney in-jokes she is told that if you've got a dress and an animal sidekick, you're a princess.The movie fits very much in the girl-empowerment ethos that has replaced Disney's original waiting-for-the-princess trope. This is very much a heroic, mythic adventure story.It's also quite funny, with a brash demigod, a cheeky ocean, and the world's dumbest rooster all doing their shtick.The songs are decent. There's a nice please-nominate-me-for-an-Oscar empowerment song that's kind of catchy, a rousing number involving sailing ships, and the best, a David Bowiesque thing called Shiny. It's not the best Disney soundtrack, but it's a pretty good one.The animation is gorgeous. At least on television, a good deal of the scenery looked photo-realistic, and the island setting allowed for a lot of natural beauty. There are also notable sequences involving living tattoos that were apparently hand drawn.Well worth watching.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Moana (2016),"If you know me well enough you would know that I'm very critical of animated films. I think a lot of them miss the mark and can only remain interesting for children. A good animated feature is inclusive of a widespread audience and can remain smart and engaging will offering fun and crafty animation. Moana is not something I was looking forward to, as on paper it didn't look like it was going to leave much of an impression on me. It's safe to say that I'm surprised that this film was honestly pretty good.The first thing that I think deserves praise is the music. Nearly every song is excellent, catchy, and just so full of life. It's hard not to sing along to the music. This isn't exactly something I can say for a lot of animated films. The more technical aspect of the film is great. The colors are very vibrant and the animation is vivid and expansive (just like the vast ocean the heroes sail). Some of the action is eye-popping and very striking, especially the battle with the lava demon, Te Ka. Auli'i Cravalho is a relative newcomer who does a very good job of bringing Moana to life. She will probably have many more voice acting roles in the future.I also think the film is a good look into a culture that many people won't be familiar with. I've noticed that Disney is really trying to focus on some minority groups in the past few years and this is perfectly good for fresh inspiration. In the case of Moana, this provided for an interesting and unfamiliar setting and story, which adds to the films overall appeal. I'm well aware of the cultural criticisms this film received for the portrayal of Maui and the lack of heroine goddesses. However, its good to leave some criticisms at the door. If you look hard enough a criticism can be found for anything and its unnecessary for a film that means well.The film has its typical Disney clichés. You have the ""chosen"" hero who is unsure of themselves. You have the relationship with a buddy that is at first strained but then leads to the characters liking each other. There is a falling out and reunion with the hero discovering their ability. The film treads familiar Disney ground. Its not a terrible thing and kids won't really give a damn about it. Its not a flawless film, at its core its a familiar formula but I think the cultural aspect and imaginative visuals put a good balance.I think Kubo and the Two Strings was far and away the best animated film of the year and proved why Laika are ahead of the curve. I'd say Moana is better than some of its animated counterparts in the year, such as Zootopia and Finding Dory. I still long for the days of 90s Disney films but this effort shows that they are still trying at least. If for nothing else, sit back and enjoy the excellent music and visuals in the film.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A remake of the little mermaid in disguise,"This has been the closest Disney ever came to realism with their characters. we get ""almost"" real looking characters with conversations you can relate to. the Hair looks so real and the water is a character by itself.. a likable one too!It was nice to see the company be more culturally aware with the material and portray the island myths and legends properly.As a movie however it is someone lack luster, there are so many call backs to Disney's little mermaid that I was just waiting for a kraken to pop up instead of ursula.You have a girl *coughprincesscough* that ""wants more"" that wants to see what's beyond the borders of her home and a father *coughkingcough* that forbids it. doesn't give her a reason just forbids it. Even when the reason is given it's the same one king trident had in the TV series of the little mermaid!If that's not enough when she finally sings her song she gives the same iconic stand as Arial does when the was crash behind her. it was eerie...As a whole the visuals were beautiful, characters almost too realistic but the movie is an average one with a very straight forward predictable plot.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Moana has plenty of fun moments, even if doesn't have much new to find with it's Disney formula","Disney has a long history of making family animated features that feature your princess, a comedic side character, villain, and of course, memorable songs that the children are going to sing for their school pageants. The majority of them are very good, though it wasn't until twenty years ago that Disney expanded the diversity of their characters. I think the first princess that wasn't white was Pocahontas. The bloated roster has introduced Mulan who is Chinese, Esmeralda from The Hunchback of Notre Dame who is gypsy, and Tiana from The Princess and the Frog who is black.The next animated tale from Disney now gives us a Polynesian princess. While adding her to the long line of princesses may not seem like a big deal, her presence marks something progressive for the company. We happen to live in a society that only has expanding minorities and to acknowledge that is a smart choice. Given how a few people have said so, people are willing to accept new kinds of characters; especially ones that kids can look up too. Moana is the name of our new character, and the newest animated film from Disney.In the prologue, we learn about how all life was created by the goddess Te Feti and became an island. But when demigod Maui (played by Dwayne Johnson) steals the islands heart, a spiritual stone, dark forces come after him. He looses the stone and his magical fishhook that gives him his shape shifting powers.Hundreds of years later, on a small island in Polynesia, Moana Waialiki (played by Auli'I Cravalho) is the daughter of the village chief. She's discouraged from going near the water, as is the entire tribe, to keep them safe. The dark forces I mentioned earlier, start to invade her island with no fish in the ocean and the fruit growing becoming rotten. At the encouragement of her grandmother, she not only discovers that her people were voyagers, but she takes one of the boats and the heart of Te Feti, and goes out to find Maui.After a storm, she finds Maui on an island where he's been exiled all this time. Upon meeting him, she finds him egotistical and very selfish who is only looking to return to being a hero for his fans. The two eventually agree to help him find his fishhook in exchange for him returning the stone.As far as Disney movies are concerned, Moana is very good. Good, but not great. Disney shouldn't have anything to worry about as the main character is a lot of fun to follow and is very likable. Dwayne Johnson, though bringing a lot of his similar traits from other movies, gets a lot of good lines and even manages to sing his song well (he's not a strong singer, but he puts a lot of emotion into his performance). Animation again looks amazing. The best thing here is the music, as the songs are composed by Lin-Manuel Miranda (responsible for the Broadway hit Hamilton). They are very catchy and may have something that can finally knock off Frozen's ""Let it Go"".So what's wrong with the movie is everything sounds good? I think its more what Disney is giving us as apposed to what the movie is giving. Moana has A LOT of the elements that you typically see in their other movies (they even joke about that in the movie). I'll give credit to Zootopia, as that not only offered more new twists, but took more chances with its material. Moana feels a tad safe when compared to the latter. That shouldn't stop people from having fun with this Polynesian set tale.I'll give this seven fishhook weapons out of ten. Moana has a lot to keep the family entertained, even if it's not offering much new. I still recommend it if you're a fan of anything Disney related. Set sail and see what you can find!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
fun music and compelling characters,"Moana is told the story of Maui (Dwayne Johnson) by her Gramma Tala. Maui is the warrior demigod who has a magical fishing hook which allows him to change shape.

The people stopped exploring and the fish are disappearing. Moana's father Chief Tui forbids her from going beyond the reefs. Moana is given the heart by the sea and she disobeys her father to go exploring. She finds Maui and together, they battle coconut pirates and Te Kā to return the heart to Te Fiti.There is a lot going for this movie. The animation is beautiful. The characters are compelling. There is a bit humor and an interesting adventure. Lin-Manuel Miranda adds his Broadway musical skills to create a few catchy tunes. It does follow the successful recent Disney formula of an empowered young girls overcoming dire odds and low sexist expectations.

At its best, which is a word one should not use about this film, it's how you imagined it. At its worst, if you've already watched Frozen, Snow White or Little Mermaid, it is frankly boring to watch and may disrupt the fancies of your imagination: I never imagined a girl sailing the ocean with a beefcake. The special effects don't go that far beyond stage play level and certainly don't live up to the reviews' descriptions. This movie has not been released to do anything new, and it's not worth the trouble obtaining watching in the theatre with 50 kids on smartphones around you.

Music is awesome and the moral about the importance of taking responsibility is anything but stale. The only real weakness of the movie is a certain repetitiveness in the middle part, but the breathtaking of the scenarios makes it equally enjoyable.

If only for the songs...,"..the songs alone made this movie very enjoyable for me. Most people say typical Disney crap. To which I say, we all know that. So why even bother? Well, the music alone are very witty and catchy. I don't know since when have I seen this type, Mulan maybe? (No Frozen don't count because the songs there aren't that catchy. To my taste at least. Again, to my taste only lest I be swarmed with hate mails from Frozen fanatics).The story, well, yeah its typical but not poorly executed. Its our usual lead saves the world by believing in her heart bla bla bla. But for kids, and with kids at heart, the execution alone made you forget about the predictability of the story we've seen in almost all animated movies. So what gives this movie edge is the songs that were all good and pleasing to the ears. Another reason why this movie was good is the presence of the character of the demi-god Maui. He's witty, funny, and that's what brought life to the otherwise boring party. The only ""cheesy"" part I couldn't handle is the end of the battle with the villain. That part where she sang her way to victory. If you've seen the film, you'll understand this. Other than that, everything was fine.",,Anonymous,Animation

Moana adds to this year's trend of progressing the limits of animation while giving stories for both children and adults.Continuing the Disney Revival era of animation, Moana provides endless charm with its two leads, and an opportunity for audiences to see a much different and diverse story portrayed on screen. Not a true musical per-say, but Moana contains some of the catchiest, heartfelt, and downright colorful musical numbers of the year. Thanks to help from Lin-Manuel Miranda, this soundtrack is bound to top the charts and awards season.Luckily, it isn't just the songs that will stick with you long after the theater, gorgeous animation and a heart-warming story flood Disney's latest hit. The filmmakers notably took plenty of time in researching the lives and culture of those living in the South Pacific, and it showed. Even if there were liberties taken, I loved learning about these people and how they lived their lives. It's a timeless adventure story that doesn't rely on pop culture references or screwball humor, instead, its layered lore and appealing leads pave the way for a glorious experience.What also struck me was the immense detail that went into making Moana. Everything from Maui's tattoos to the lively ocean, this may be the most beautiful animated film to date. Ironically, it will be up against Kubo & the Two Strings come awards season, and they both share many qualities. Both have groundbreaking animation, fantastical and mythological characters, and a coming of age story of a youth growing into a leader.I think the only weaknesses were with the pacing and its villain. Not unlike Frozen in that the antagonistic elements aren't really present until the third act. It's not an overwhelming negative considering the film does just fine without a true villain, but the absence is definitely felt at times. The middle act also is a little slow, and I wasn't a big fan of one particular character introduced about halfway through, but the third act was truly remarkable.So even though I thought having The Rock sing or casting a completely unknown in the title role was a risk, it couldn't have turned out better for Disney's next chapter in their revival. Plenty of well- strung songs, detailed animation, and a thoughtfully important story makes Moana one of the best animated movies in quite some time, and certainly of 2016.+Brilliant songs+Detailed animation+Heart-warming story+Different & diverse Disney film-Middle act slows9.3/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Beautiful island and people, my thoughts on the haters","I have read a lot of negative reviews of this movie. Their complaints are that the plot was predictable and boring, and it was too similar to other animated films, so it was a greedy Disney formula. I haven't watched any animated films lately, and I haven't seen Disney since I was much younger. For me, it's going to seem more fresh and unique for that reason. Most modern American movies have happy endings,so it is usually pretty predictable. Old movies usually make a point to have a surprise ending. (I also have been watching Chinese dramas, which often have sad endings, which leaves more room for plot twists.)Complaining about the Disney formula? Princess main character, fights evil and wins? Ummmmm? That is Disney,OK. Why are you watching Disney and complaining then? Maybe the movie is not for your demographic? If so, again don't watch it. If no other Disney movie was ever made,and you had nothing to compare this movie to, I found things about this movie very touching. A few times I found myself crying and it was the strangest thing because I didn't understand why. The movie didn't make me happy or sad, but it was chilling and it shook me. These people complaining about boring, predictable plots need a heart transplant. The connections she had with the ocean, her family, ancesestors and feeling the hope to restore and save them. It was really deep, and supernatural. The way certain parrs were animated porreayed it in a beautiful and amazing way. I also watched Dr.Strange on the same day as this movie and the plots of both movies had many similarities, and I couldn't find anyone else talking about it on the internet. But, I thought it was odd to watch two movies so similar to each other on the same day, one a marvel movie one a Disney movie. No one notices the plot similarities?",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"What can they say, except ""you're welcome""?","With its unique and beautifully presented Polynesian aesthetic, setting and protagonist, this classic-feeling yet progressively modern Disney musical leaves you with nothing but a smile on your face. Despite its somewhat typical and, thus, predictable, story (in its beat-for-beat, 'studio sample' plot), 'Moana (2016)' is still an entertaining, joy-filled experience that has an undeniably effective narrative and the occasional moment of emotional resonance, to boot. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Propped up by beautiful animation,"'Moana' is a decent movie, however there are a few flaws that bring it down--chiefly odd pacing and below average songs. In terms of pacing, the character development felt very rushed, often with characters changing over the course of a few seconds after one small event. The development almost felt like an afterthought.The songs, I felt, were not up to Disney's standards, with the exception of ""You're Welcome"" the songs/singing felt kind of stilted, falling just short of expectations. It almost felt as if the producers cut the time spent on developing the songs, as they were thought out well but just missed in execution. I believe if some more time was spent tweaking the songs they would have delivered.However, Moana's most glaring flaws are obscured by it's animation. The movie is visually stunning, especially the water/sea. It is worth watching just for the visuals alone. Honestly, if it weren't for the visuals, I would have given Moana around a 5.5 as the story was a bit lacking, but Disney did such a fantastic job on the animation that I would have no problem giving 'Moana' a 7.5, even if it had been a silent movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""Moana"" is one of the best animated movies of 2016!","""Moana"" is the Polynesian word for ""ocean"". And that's only the beginning of the cultural and historical connections between Polynesia and Walt Disney Animation Studios' ""Moana"" (PG, 1:43). After a lengthy, worldwide talent search, the job of voicing the title character went to Hawaiian native Auli'i Cravalho, who then became, at the age of 14, the youngest person ever to voice a Disney princess character. Her co-star, Dwayne Johnson, also of Polynesian (Samoan) descent, plays a character based on a major figure of the same name from Polynesian legend. Cravalho and Johnson are joined by Troy Polamalu, the former NFL Pro Bowl player, who also has Samoan ancestry and voiced one of the villagers. Besides casting these and other actors of Polynesian blood, Disney developed this movie by sending co-directors Ron Clements and John Musker on tours of the South Pacific in order to make sure the film accurately and respectfully portrayed the look and culture of Polynesia. Of course, this is all within the context of a Disney animated feature film which, in my opinion, has turned out to be the studio's best in years.Moana Waialiki (Cravalho) is the daughter of the chief of a small topical island called Motunui. She grew up hearing legends about the origins of her world and the water which surrounds it and always felt drawn to the ocean. It's an attraction that her father, Chief Tui (Temuera Morrison), won't allow her to indulge, fearing for her safety, while Moana's Gramma Tala (Rachel House) urges her to be who she is meant to be. When a mysterious plague starts killing the fish and vegetation on which her people depend, Moana feels compelled to follow the example of her wayfinding ancestors and make a journey across the ocean in search of a legendary remedy – and she is convinced that the ocean has chosen her.Moana is sailing off in search of the legendary shape-shifting demigod, Maui (Johnson), who helped create this world by pulling the islands up out of the ocean with his large, magical fishhook and by controlling the son to lengthen the day. But he also stole a beautiful green gem stone – the heart of the island goddess, Te Fiti. The lava demon, Te Ka, then attacked Maui, causing him to lose the stone, as well as his fishhook and end up stranded on a remote island for 1,000 years. When Moana lands there, Maui believes the gods have sent him the boat to end his exile. Maui is a very arrogant, self-assured demigod and has no interest in helping this young island girl to save the world from the plague – which he caused.Convincing Maui to travel with her to put back Te Fiti's heart (which the ocean itself has graciously but insistently brought back up) is only the first of Moana's challenges with Maui at her side. Moana knows nothing about seafaring, so Maui has to teach her. So Maui can utilize all his powers, Moana has to help him retrieve his magic fishhook, a task that involves making it through some place called the Realm of the Monsters. Then they have to fend off an attack from cute, but nasty coconut pirates which look and act like a cross between the Minions from the ""Despicable Me"" movies and Immortan Joe's army in ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" – on the high seas. If our heroes survive all that (and crossing the ocean on a glorified raft), there's the issue of getting past Te Ka so they can put back Te Fiti's heart. Simple, right? ""Moana"" is a highly entertaining and edifying journey. Although the character of Moana and her mission are Disney inventions, the heart of the story is the rich and exotic culture of the Polynesian people of the South Sea islands. Moana is a tough and determined but vulnerable and adorable combination of previous Disney heroines like Merida from ""Brave"", Ariel from ""The Little Mermaid"", Rapunzel from ""Tangled"", Anna from ""Frozen"" and Mulan from ""Mulan"". (However, the adventure that accompanies Moana's mission and the character of Maui will likely make this movie popular with the boys too.) Of course, a Disney princess (or, ""Chief's daughter"" as Moana prefers) needs a sidekick and she has a bug-eyed, none-too-bright pet rooster named Heihei for company and substantial comic relief.The film features computer animation, mainly to enhance the look of the ocean on screen (the water – and the entire film – are gorgeous!), but there are also some hand-drawn images nested within the movie – in the form of Maui's tattoos, which move on their own, illustrating scenes from his life and giving him advice. Then there's the wonderful original music – much of it by none other than ""Hamilton"" auteur Lin-Manuel Miranda (hired for this job even before his revolutionary musical take on American history took Broadway by storm) – and Dwayne Johnson sings some of Miranda's composition! Last but not least, the film is bookended by the clever animated short ""Inner Workings"" – and a very funny post-credits shout-out to the directors' 1989 film ""The Little Mermaid"". ""Moana"" is not to be missed! ""A""",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Tremendous Movie,"Just saw Moana today and was completely blown away.Moana is the story of a princess of a Polynesian island paradise who senses that something is going wrong. Turns out the problem is that the mischievous demigod Maui has stolen the ""heart,"" a jewel, from a neighboring island and this has cast a curse over her whole island society. The ocean chooses her to make a perilous journey across the sea to find Maui and get him to return the jewel and restore prosperity to her island.Moana is a startling film on a bunch of levels. The animation is not only magically crafted, it also has a great amount of variety and stunning beauty--no Disney film has ever fallen in love with its setting as much as this one. Moana also has an excellent musical score that pays great homage to the culture that it depicts with use of native instruments and choral stylistic elements. Moana has wonderful characters--Moana and Maui develop a terrific (non- romantic) relationship, as Moana helps Maui toward redemption from his terrible mistake and Maui turns her into a master voyager--in other words, helps her find her full potential as a human being.There is quite simply nothing to dislike about this movie--Disney at its absolute best.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Breathtaking visuals and fun characters pull it through,"Thinking about Moana now, the first thing that comes to mind is the scene in which she goes to the shoreline of her island and the first song plays. Watching this scene on a big screen in HD is a jaw dropping experience, as you are mesmerized by all the pretty colours. The rounded shapes of the human characters are contrasted by the crispy textures of moss, grass and waves.As with many such Pixar animations, the creators go out of their way to make everything as colourful as possible, to the point that they create scenes with neon-lit magical creatures seemingly for no other purpose than to justify using colours you would not otherwise encounter in that environment.This does have the desired effect of making this movie look gorgeous, but also acts like a set of jingling keys, meant to distract the viewer from the fact that everything else is just ok.This animated film has interesting characters, with Moana herself not being one of them. The demigod Maui's dominating arrogance is a refreshing trait for a main character, his animating tattoos are funny (although this again is more of a visual aspect than a character trait), his backstory is interesting, and his arch is subtle. Dwayne Johnson fits very well in this role. The giant crab is fun, even though he is not on screen for long.However, the plot is just a rehash of the same old story: a young woman feels the drive to cross a boundary set by her guardians. She then disobeys, gets in trouble, but ultimately overcomes the hardships, learning about herself in the process and usually learning to be more responsible. The garnish put on top of that foundation, in the form of a stone Moana has to return to a goddess, does nothing to make things fresh. There is a fascinating little twist at the end, which puts Maui's character in an even more interesting light but that's about it.Most of the songs are curtesy of Lin-Manuel Miranda. How Far I'll Go has a catchy chorus but is otherwise very simple lyrically. You're Welcome is much more interesting, and it was surprising to hear Dwayne Johnson sing so well. Jemaine Clement from Flight of the Concords gives an eccentric performance of the song Shiny. None of these songs are particularly catchy, but they are diverse and interesting.Moana is a pleasant watch from beginning to end. It's a shame about the unremarkable main character and an even more unremarkable plot. If I have to sit through another aspirational story of a girl dreaming about the horizon and finding herself, I am going to puke.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A missed opportunity,"This was a charity screening in Sydney, Australia. The Audience was 80% Polynesian, (Australia has a large population of Pacific Islanders and Moari) 10% Asian, as in Chinese and 10% Aussie. I am getting dementia, I have a dozen Hilo Hattie dresses and same Tahitian Pareu and wore a T shirt dress, after noticing all Frangipani (Plumeria) were coming into flower, didn't pick one much less make a lei. I have been looking forward to this film for a year, it was top of my wanna see list. I was disappointed. This is a nice film with good songs, too many in-jokes, and a formulistic storyline. A little thought could have made it one of the great Disney films. Missed Opportunity #1. The short film prior, about the human body was crxx. A total waste of time, and irrelevant to the theme. Pity they couldn't play 'Lava' from Pixar. Missed opportunity #2. A short documentary on the real life Hokulea of the Polynesian voyaging society, a double hull Polynesian ship sailing around the world as we speak, would have been ideal. MO#3 The chance to make Polynesian myths as valid as Greek myths, which they greatly resemble with capricious Gods and unreliable demi-Gods. Oh, I forgot, Hollywood made 'Troy' without Gods, and without reading the Iliad. Sigh. MO#4 The very real art of Herb Kane, whose images that could so easily had been used in the film to lend greater realism and authenticity. MO#5 over the opening or closing titles, instead of shells and flowers, how about an animated map of the great triangle of Polynesia, showing just how far the wayfinders went... AND: Where was Pele?

A Perfect Disney Movie,"This is hands down one of the best Disney movies ever in my life. The animation is very beautiful, the characters are really likable, the humor is spot-on, the music in it is very enjoyable, the action in it is fantastic. I love this movie so much with a passion. This is easily my all time favorite Disney movie of all time, it's that good. This movie had lived up to a type, in any of it's expectations of being shoddy, this is one of the rarest animated movies that is absolutely flawless. The humor gets better with its considerable charm, some scenes does get sad in some parts, it is considerably one of the best that Disney had ever did. Even the voice-acting is brilliant, they did such a great job with the voice-acting, because it connects their personality of their characters. The plot is very admirable as well, because it focuses on a young Polynesian navigator who wants to become a master wayfinder, and with the help with the once powerful demi- god name Maui, it's up to him and her to stop the lava monster, and save her village. I really hope that it gets a sequel pretty soon because this movie is awesome, and it deserves to get a sequel. If you haven't seen it, go check it out, you'll be in for a real treat. Just, wow was this movie great, this is just amazing. I give this movie a 10/10 for being such a brilliant and perfect movie.

"Now this is a heroine. Thanks, Disney!","""If you wear a dress and have an animal sidekick, you're a princess."" Maui (Dwayne Johnson)In animated Moana, the titular Polynesian heroine is also a Disney heroine: smart, feisty, beautiful, wearing a dress, and with a chicken for a sidekick. She is memorable the way a little mermaid or shining fish might be, but more so, because she represents so much of the Samoan and Maori cultures in addition to the impressive musical ones.Yet, maybe the most impressive musical bit comes more from David Bowie than the islands, a song rich about a gold crab's shell punctuated with vigor and humor. Because this is a Disney fantasy, most of the songs are about self actualization and empowerment especially tailored to a pre-teen looking to know who she is and why the ocean has chosen her to save her people.Director Ron Clements and writer Jared Bush show their chops once again by incorporating wit and diffidence in both the heroine and the demigod Maui, whom she seeks to save her people, who have been blighted by years of conservatism and isolationism (""Never go beyond the reef"" is their mantra). The fertility that she exemplifies in the face of their sterility is emphasized finally by the closing shot of a beached sea shell.The Disney refrain of being who you are and who you want to be, while trite in the extreme given the animated history behind these toons, is fresh enough because it is existentially the place for any developing young person and because in these parlous times.Maona is an antidote for cynicism and a hallelujah for ethnic richness promoted by tribal music and dance and family values that feature respect for elders and emerging power for women.

All characters were so beautiful, with long curly hair and I was just loving them. Baby pig and chicken were unusual pets and it was another new and fun thing to see.I loved that the main character Moana (Auli'i Cravalho) was really brave and tough and strong and that the semi-god Maui (Dwayne Johnson) was sort of grumpy and pessimistic. They made a nice pair, similar to that of a human's heart and brain. Heart is positive and optimistic and brain is rigid and pessimistic.I really loved everything in the movie, everything seemed new, refreshing, never seen before...Even the crab was different, with a shiny shell...

It was simple yet incredibly rich...It was perfect! Everyone can enjoy it, get inspired and learn from it!

Moana,"Only 5 years old but Moana now largely feels like a classic Disney film from another age, for two main reasons:Firstly, the female protagonist is not presented as a victim or ""oppressed"" at any point: she actually comes from a stable and loving family with high expectations of her to become the chief of their village, yet she still has to learn and change and grow to fulfil her destiny and succeed by the end.Secondly, the male characters are not torn down, degraded or emasculated in any way that I could see: Moana's father is just a great dad, loving, helpful and supportive, and Moana's companion on her adventure, Maui, is strong and heroic, complementing her own gifts and abilities throughout in a harmonious and encouraging way.Though the animation is miraculously good - in the digital age I don't think I've ever seen better - there are some faults: the songs are all awful; the secondary characters are dull and generic; it drags a little at points, and for a kid's movie it would have benefited from being 15 minutes or so shorter.

'Moana' Brings Disney Closer To Its Former Glory Than It's Ever Been,"Adventurous, endearing & delightfully amusing, the latest feature film from Walt Disney Animation Studios finds the legendary studio at the very peak of its Revival Era and closer than it's ever been to its former glory, for Moana is another excellent blend of first-rate storytelling & dazzling animation that promises plenty of fun & enjoyment to viewers of all ages and skilfully delivers it.The story of Moana follows its titular character, the only daughter of a Polynesian tribe's Chieftain who's always been curious about what lies beyond the reef surrounding her island. And when their crops begin to fail, she sets off on an epic journey across the ocean to find the demigod Maui, who caused the blight by stealing a mystical relic from a goddess, and persuade him to return it.Directed by Ron Clements & John Musker, the film quickly glances over its mythology & Polynesian tribe's way of life before moving ahead with its main plot, and maintains a steady pace & fun vibe throughout its runtime. The direction is neat, plot is expertly handled, humour is finely applied even though it goes overboard at times, and the characters of Moana & Maui are handled with elegance.The animation is absolutely gorgeous, decorating the film with sumptuous set pieces and employs some hand-crafted magic as well on its CGI canvas. Every image brims with vibrant colours, sharp outlines, terrific lighting & a sense of depth. The soundtrack is beautifully composed & seamlessly integrated into the narrative, and while the musical numbers aren't catchy, they do carry a melodic tune.It's quite impossible to not like a film that has Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, playing a demigod, and singing songs. Bringing Maui to life with finesse, it's evident that Johnson had a lot of fun voicing this character that seems tailor-made for him in more ways than one. The character of Moana is voiced by a newcomer and she does an outstanding job at it, wonderfully balancing the vocal tonality to fit the particular moment.On an overall scale, Moana is a musical that has something in store for everyone. Not everything works out in the film's favour though, for the sentient coconut pirate scene was quite unnecessary and the sidekicks overstay their welcome but it offers consistent delivery of laughs, a welcome depth in its plot & characters, and wonderfully carved moments of genuine warmth to finish as another high-quality addition to Disney's repertoire. Definitely recommended.",,Anonymous,Animation

"Good, but not Great","Moana, the successor to the mega hit, Frozen; this may be where the problem lies. However, as an adult viewer, I also have my own personal expectations for a film. This film created a beautiful world for us to live in for a short time. The work put into the film really shows in the visuals. The sea looked inviting and the village seemed joyful and welcoming as well. The story was told well with playful stabs at Disney's track record of formulas.While I didn't have a problem with Moana, I was not challenged. This film was very safe and didn't feel like it wanted to take risks. I like a movie to make me think and have a dialog about something. Frozen, while I believe is far over-hyped, did challenge itself and made a narrative in a new shape and style. This film, while avoiding typical love interests, did not make me walk away from the film with anything to discuss. It happened. It was good. I had fun, but that was it. Great movies do not end there. Great movies have something to say that pesters you on the way out of the theater. This movie makes you dig for something to force a conversation about. If you are going to see this with younger kids, they will love it, but you will probably not have the same reaction.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

MOANA,"I like watching animated films with my son. We watched it on Netflix. Moana is the daughter of the chief of the tribe of a tropic island. When the life on island ceases to exist (no fish, no harvest etc..) Moana is chosen by the ocean to save the life and the adventure begins.
Moana is not one of the best animated films I watched, but it is a good film that you can watch for fun with children.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Awesome adventure film!,"I liked this much better than ""Frozen."" Much much better. ""Frozen"" felt like a typical nothing special movie that had already been done before in several Disney movies. This was very different. They even made fun of the typical Disney princess cliches. This was essentially the antithesis to the Disney Princess movies. The songs in ""Frozen"" were a bit too Broadway for my taste, but the songs here were fun island tropical songs that were fun to dance to. And some of the lyrics are very clever. (Thanks, Lin-Manuel Miranda). There were also some likes of dialogue where I was laughing so hard I was crying. That hasn't happened in a long time. This was more of an adventure epic instead of a princess movie. ""Frozen"" was clearly aimed at little girls, but everyone can enjoy ""Moana."" There is a short before the film that while it was clever, all I could think during it was ""Disney copied their own thing. This is Inside Out with internal organs instead of the mind."" One of the villains in the movie who was voiced by Jemaine Clement was fun, but I wish he had tried to change his voice a bit, because all I could think was ""This is the bird from ""Rio"""". It was kind of distracting. This was a fun adventure movie that I give my highest regards.

Good & Bad,"There was a lot to like about Moana.I liked the diversity in the movie and that the princess didn't have a love interest thrown in. There was some good comedic relief as well and great Disney visuals per usual.However, what killed this movie for me was the constant singing. I get that it's a Disney movie which means I should expect some singing, but it felt like there was singing scenes that flowed right into another singing scene. Basically, it felt more like a Disney musical than a movie.Had there been half as much singing, I think this would have been a phenomenal movie. But it felt like none of the characters could talk without breaking into song and dance.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Disneys last classic...,"At the time I watched it enthusiastically in the sneak preview with my sweetheart, now with the small results of this wonderful connection.In 2016, everything was still halfway okay at Disney, no change from conveying values to (obvious) ideological transfer, no digression from core competences, no absolute lack of ideas. Accordingly, Vaiana is probably the last great film, and over the years it has even matured into a classic.A likeable main heroine, without any negative flavour, a wonderful story with depth, charismatic supporting characters, lots of them, variety, fantasy, simply pure magic. Plus a great soundtrack with lots of catchy tunes. In short, what you expect from Disney. Once expected.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Charming and delightful,"There are various things I could say about this film that make it sound like I didn't like it. For example, I could say that it's very formulaic in its narrative and character arcs. The themes are also very derivative of themes that other films have also examined. Nothing about the film is entirely surprising. However, it says something about the quality of the execution that despite how predictable it is, it's still able to work wonders. The animation is dazzling and beautiful and the characters are really written with a lot of care. Although the story itself is very derivative, having these types of characters (of Polynesian roots) in the forefront is definitely something original and I do hope that Disney, even when creating films that hit the same beats and follow the same formula, can still create characters that are different in that way.",,Anonymous,Animation
I actually enjoyed this,"I only ever watch Disney movies because my daughter wants to see them. This one is the first one that never once made me cringe! A good story with an admirable protagonist and some really good songs. Moana's relationship with her grandmother was well-done and touching. I hope that future Disney musicals will be this good, because my daughter's only five so I guess I have a few more years of watching them.Until Moana, Frozen was the only Disney movie that had ever moved me to tears. Now the list is up to two!It's hard to think of anything else to say that wouldn't be a spoiler. I found myself wondering how much the story is grounded in actual Polynesian culture, traditions, religion, and how much they just made up from scratch.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Another beautiful and memorable classic from Disney,"Moana falls in line next to Tangled and Frozen as an instant classic 'Disney Princess' movie. The stand-out performance of Auli'i Cravalho as the voice of Moana carried the emotional weight of the movie through some of Disney's most beautiful songs to date, while Dwayne Johnson's experience as an actor provided the necessary humour and comedy to support the young Hawaiian-born actress in her acting debut. Dwayne Johnson's performance singing 'You're Welcome' was also a very pleasant surprise.The supporting cast is also full of surprises, and so many of the lesser songs are still immensely moving. The film is certainly transported from scene to scene by the music, and the native languages featured in some of the numbers shows Disney's respect and appreciation of the culture they're exploring.Disney's animation has also taken another leap, and the quality of the movie's visuals is surpassed only by the immense care and detail the animators showed in every scene.It has its issues, of course, as all films do. The plot is predictable, and as bitter-sweet as the ending is, it's certainly not going to be a surprise. As is the case with all animated family films, there is rarely a fear of the protagonist being in any significant danger, and a happy ending is inevitable.If you want a feel-good movie with fun songs, good laughs, and a simply happy, yet still rewarding ending, Moana is definitely the top movie of 2016 for you.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
7.8 Fair enough. Obviously not Pixar. Haha...,"I appreciated how it paid homage to earlier Disney films; whether that is picked up on or instead called ""cliché "" , ""cookie-cutter"" or too ""annoyingly musical"" is up to the audience. I like musicals and classic Disney so that won the movie over for me.But, it did fall short on what could have been even better scenes or more story.Overall: Refreshing story about a legendary character that hasn't been told; Maui, not Moana. Some cool and memorable songs. But the story left me wanting more and in a sort of disappointed way.*Non-plot related spoilers ahead*-The Kakamora coconut pirates were interesting, but had could have used even just one more scene later.-Would have been nice with scenes of Maui's backstory rather than just talking about it.-Environment. Didn't show as much island. Which is okay. Also comparatively, in Frozen the environment became mostly snow and Moana mostly ocean.

Your typical Disney movie.,"Moana is a big budget movie by Disney, with hawaian Auli'i Cravalho as Moana, the protagonist of the movie, and Dwayne Johnson as Maui, a legendary shape-shifting demigod, who plays a good cop bad cop routine. This movie has a lot of singing and the classical Walt Disney's rain of gags that splashes your face every second. Usually, in a Disney's movie , there're more hits than misses. In Moana, there's still more hits than misses, but there are more misses than normal. The singing in the movie is alright, with Cravalho providing a stunning singing performance and with an OK Dwayne Johnson, who sadly you realize since the first song he is not a singer. The idea for the story is actually amazing (Which reminded me of The Village, by Shyamalan, about a girl forbidden of abandoning the little island where her family lived, even when she had the most adventurous soul on the island. This idea provided a lot of possibilities to the screenwriter. But when the idea starts to develop, then the movie cuts down to size in terms of quality. The screenplay is kinda cliché and after watching the first half hour, you know how it's gonna end. The screenplay might be the biggest flaw. Still, the animation is really, really good, and there are a lot of great jokes. It will be a lot of fun if you get your kids to watch it, and anyone in the family would enjoy it, because of its light-hearted premise and the family-friendly but smart sense of humour. It's a good film, but it might be one of the weakest of Disney's catalogue, which is near to perfect anyway. I think you should watch it, you will have a good time.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Formulaic and predictable,First I have to admit I do not like the name Moana. It sounds like someone is moaning. Moan-aaaa ahhhh no I really don't understand some people who have voted with ten stars this movie. It was not fun..predictable ..and not respected a lot the need to challenge. I think there is something suspicious is happening with the positive criticism here...simply don't listen to these trolls talking hallelujah about this movie claiming is it perfection - yes 10/10. I just feel sad for those who have give to that film that high rating. They are fooling themselves and I guess they have issues that need to take care of this issues with some professional help. I believe it is so unfair to see that a non entertaining comedy has 9 or 10 rating...and a fan movie has a low rating...all this makes me think that actually the rating system in here is for trash heads.

One of the best Disney Animated Movies of the 2010s,"In anticipation of Moana 2 (2024) coming out next week, I decided to finally watch Moana (2016) in its entirety for the first time ever. Now that I've watched it, I can say that Moana (2016) is easily among one of my favorite animated movies from Disney.Positives for Moana (2016):
The first thing that I love about this movie is of course the main character of Moana. This is easily one of the best female characters in recent memory and she is one of those female characters who feels like a person who you can relate to. On top of that, Auli'i Cravalho does a fantatsic job with her voice performance as Moana. Then, you have The Rock as Maui or just The Rock because he literally playing himself in this movie, but it's among one of the better versions of The Rock that I've seen recently. As always, the animation in this movie looks gorgeous from start to finish. The movie also has a lot of great humor with certain jokes and they got a laugh out of me. There's a awesome fight sequences where Moana takes out an army of Coconuts and it is glorious. And finally, the climax of this movie is absolutely badass.Overall, Moana (2016) is another fantastic animated movie from Disney and I can't wait to see Moana 2 (2024).",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Enjoyable Cartoon Covering Hawaiian Culture and Youth,"7.1 of 10. Not up to the high standards that Sausage Party set for cartoons this year, but it definitely fulfills Disney's standard for creating inspirational stories for youth that intertwine with mythology and culture.It's also better than Kubo and the Two Strings, which it's more likely to be compared to given the importance of water in the story. The water animation itself is also better in Moana, from the transparency to the movement of the creatures in it.This should be a very enjoyable cartoon for girls and young women. Certainly above the crop of 2015 cartoons.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Amazing,"The movie begins rather slow. It starts off clichéd and pretty predictable. But, it does pay off very well with the creative world building and the new characters found there with some fantastic songs. The animation is also spectacular with strong use of colour and some great presentation of the magic and the creatures lives in the village or in the sea. The characters also helps with great backstory and being a lot of fun. The only issue with the cast is that the villains doesn't have enough screen time that can be passed off as just an obstacle for Moana. This is a great Disney movie, and another timeless classic.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A visually astonishing animation, albeit not the most enthralling","Continuing their Second Renaissance in style, Disney may have just hit upon their most visually beautiful film of all time with Moana. With crisp and vibrant animation everywhere you look, this film is a real feast for the eyes. It's also a very entertaining and funny family adventure, thanks to two great central performances, and although it may not have the brains or the emotional depth of some of Disney's best recent work, Moana is an absolute delight to watch from start to finish.Let's start, however, with the animation, which blew me away. Just as visually impressive as Pixar, Moana is a film that really embraces the beauty of nature, and shows it off on screen in a way you've probably never seen before. Whilst Finding Nemo and Dory were incredible feats in depicting the sea through animation, there's something about Moana's crisp and photo-realistic vision of a bright blue Polynesian ocean that's even more stunning to witness.This is easily one of the most colourful and vibrant films I've ever seen. Along with the eye-watering blue sea, the landscapes are also absolutely wonderful to look at, with the beautiful bright greens of the trees mixing with the browns and sandy whites of the ground, making every single image on screen utterly dazzling for the eyes.However, it's not only the stunning animation that makes Moana such a delightful watch. Huge credit has to go to the lead voice actors, Auli'i Cravalho and Dwayne Johnson, who play Moana and Maui respectively. Although both characters are at first a little difficult to love, when they embark on their epic journey across the ocean together, they become an absolutely perfect duo.The characters themselves and their contrasting personalities play off one another so well, making for some great laughs and adding some fun into what can be a surprisingly small and solitary movie, focusing almost entirely on the two alone together at sea. However, the voice performances are what really make the two characters, as Cravalho gives Moana the perfect determination and strength to be a likable and exciting protagonist, whilst Dwayne Johnson's sheer charisma makes Maui a perfect counterpart, and the two make the pairing hugely entertaining from start to finish.Now, as a whole, Moana is wonderfully family-friendly, and definitely the most upbeat and funny of the Disney's recent releases. The leading duo are cute and cuddly, and their chemistry makes for loads of laughs, whilst the story's clear and direct objective makes a very easy-to-read watch for all ages.However, that does unfortunately come at an expense. Over the past few years, Disney's increasingly impressive repertoire has proved how intelligent, deep and rousing an animated kids' film can be. From Zootopia's fascinating social commentary to Wreck-It Ralph's beautiful emotion, I was expecting a similar degree of depth and brains from Moana, but I would be lying if I said I wasn't a little disappointed.Whilst the animation is at times enough to make your eyes water, the story here doesn't really provide an enthralling experience, as Moana and Maui's journey seems plagued by a rather formulaic level-by-level plan. It's entertaining without a doubt, but the way we follow the two moving from adversary to adversary, and never really delving as much into each of their emotional stories.That was a little disappointing for me, but not so much given the rest of the film's sheer beauty. If there is one major disappointment I have with Moana, then it's the soundtrack. Apart from the fact that I didn't even feel it was necessary, the musical numbers here feel very forced. There's nothing like the rousing anthems of Frozen's soundtrack, and although one song is uplifting, many of the numbers both come about and end in a very abrupt manner, consistently frustrating me as I was looking to be more exhilarated by the music.Overall, however, Moana is a very good film. Hugely entertaining from start to finish thanks to its two main leads and excellent comedy, and particularly delightful because of its utterly beautiful animation, I had a great time watching this wonderful family movie, and although its story is a little on the thin side and its music is somewhat underwhelming, I wholeheartedly recommend Moana.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Heartfelt and Lovely Adventure Through Polynesian Waters,"Moana is a delightful and exhilarating adventure filled with a captivating story, it's like The Little Mermaid, but with a richer sense of Polynesian culture and a greater emphasis on exploration and courage, and it was just incredibly well done, Dwayne Johnson lending his voice to Maui in what could be his best performance yet, even considering his live-action work, Auli'i Cravalho is also wonderful as Moana, bringing her character's spirit and resilience to life, the journey is deeply meaningful driven by Moana's close bond with her grandmother, her friendship with the mischievous demigod Maui, and her courageous mission to return the heart of Te Fiti, also added with either quite a catchy song or just a pure beauty of ""How Far I'll Go"", a song that perfectly captures Moana's determination, and the animation were also at times just looks really pretty, overall Moana is another Disney triumph, a fun lovely adventure full of hearts pour into it, kids will love it, adults will enjoy it, and i love it.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
7.5/10,"Moana Waialiki is a sea voyaging enthusiast and the only daughter of a chief in a long line of navigators. When her island's fisherman can't catch any fish and the crops fail, she learns that the demigod Maui caused the blight by stealing the heart of the goddess Te Fiti. The only way to heal the island is to persuade Maui to return Te Fiti's heart, so Moana sets off on an epic journey across the Pacific. The film is based on stories from Polynesian mythology.Given the recent streak of incredible films by Disney Animation, it is becoming ordinary for me to be really excited for one of their pictures. ""Moana"" does not tamper my enthusiasm, it is the most visually beautiful animated picture I have seen and one that has to spare some interesting stories to the audience, even though its plot and its musical numbers may occasionally stagger.What hit me really deep about the film was the cultural representation of these people. Other than offering many cue points for reflection on civilization, the way in which this culture is brought to life is really touching. Everything you'd want is given the life brilliantly, from the presentation of everyday life, traditions and society roles, to the relation of the people with their land and nature, which is probably the most resonant aspect of the film, right down to the changes that affect the population. This film really touched me on a cultural level it brought to life a place and people that aren't really given any space in the cinematic medium and it was a joy to be able to experience it and moreover experience it with this level of craft behind it, which always made it forward the story.That is the background on which our characters emerge and once again Disney graces us with colorful, rich and classic characters that really manage to stick out. Moana is a fresh character, her basic dynamic is really interesting and makes for very good and genuine drama in the first act. Moreover, there is a magnificent sequence in which she grows up on her desire for exploration is explained and shown to the audience perfectly. The supporting cast of characters is just as rich and motivated as her, Maui stands out as the classic reversal of the stereotype that Disney does for comedic value and once again it works. Moana's grandmother too is a hippy-like version of this culture and it hits good emotional beats both comedically and dramatically. Moreover, the film is quite funny and that has to be given to the great touches of slapstick comedy given to the chicken and the witty touches added by Maui.Yet, what is possibly the most stunning aspect of the film resides only in its animation. The land and the nature of the places we visit are brought to life in ways I could not have ever imagined. The images are intelligent, rich and colorful, they manage to never get repetitive or banal, they are just this canvas of beauty and you can't help but be overwhelmed by it, especially because to the absolutely gorgeous visuals sound is combined in extremely smart ways and used in order to give the audience a heightened experience and feel the place rather than just look at it, really bringing forth a sensorial experience rather than just a viewing one.However, ""Moana"" does not rank among the very best Disney has offered us recently as it presents some flaws that make it a little choppy. Firstly, the musical numbers can occasionally feel meandering, as I said above there are different songs that are beautiful and bring forth the story and the characters, yet there are as many songs where characters just erupt into singing and it only feels like they are screaming ""I am in a Disney film and I'm going to siiiiing as I embark on my journey!"". The plot also has a few issues in the fact that it gets incredibly convoluted in a chain of events that really don't need to be there, it is hard to tell where we're at at times and moreover it gives the film some pacing issues towards the end.In the end ""Moana"" serves as a great addition to the Disney canon of their recent years, it is definitely remarkable and certainly not forgettable, whilst it might not be their usual quality, it is still a great ride to have at the cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
No other movie moves me like this,I can't believe that this film rates 7.6. I'm 50 years old and have never seen a film that moves me so greatly. I just watched the movie for the tenth time with my daughters and I have tears flowing 30 minutes after its conclusion. It is simply stunning on all levels. I watched my wife throughout the movie and saw her a number of times in tears almost overwhelmed. She has also seen this film on multiple occasions.How powerful this is. Moana conquers her own fears and the fears of those around her and provides a lesson to all of us. All should see this but in particular girls as it is one if the first animated films to portray females with a strength that can accomplish all. Inspiring.,10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Let the girls be Moana... and the boys be moaning...,"And Now For Something... Completely... Identical! ""Moana"" is a dazzling-looking story but to put it simply, it's not very interesting. The film is so obedient to all the recent trends that have defined Disney's movies that you can't find one little parcel of originality, it's basically ""The Little Mermaid"" story retold in ""Lilo and Stitch"" setting with a ""Pocahontas""-like character who's the same age than ""Brave"" and driven by a ""Frozen"" narrative. Oahu... Deja-Vu... and when a Hawaiian story leaves you cold, you know there's a problem.To give her deserved credit, Moana is a charming, adorable and strong-minded young preteen girl who has a lot to appeal to, but she's just too typical to strike as a fully developed Disney protagonist even when you try to ignore the trend. Once again, she's royalty, she happens to be the daughter's chief and her dream is to go sailing and discover the other side of the world. Yes, for some reasons later revealed but without being too satisfying, the entire village is stuck on the little island planting coconuts, eating coconuts and singing about how much they love coconuts. No problem, I love coconuts too. But I prefer fish.Some back-story is provided through another ominous legend about a mysterious heart being stolen from the local Goddess allowing a semi-god named Maui to create the human race, the animation was cool and didn't really cut-and-paste something from Disney movies but it still reminded me of ""Kung Fu Panda""... sorry, nothing new again. But even by accepting magic as an obligatory narrative trope in animated movies, I was wondering why is it that most girl-power movies must rely so much on the supernatural.Think about it, whether for Elsa, Moana or even Rey from ""Star Wars"", there's always an element of magic that undermines the idea of a girl or a woman singlehandedly triumphing over the obstacles or despite her weaknesses. Minimizing the help of people or even animal sidekicks, these new trendy heroines most often rely on the assistance of magic, which doesn't really highlight their efforts or their merits. In ""Moana"", the interference of magical waves or reincarnations or any superpowers from Maui are so numerous that the film loses its capability to thrill you, when you get used to these magic ex machina moment, you stop considering any danger a real threat, andthat's a threat for enjoyment.Now, I know the film is another instance of a movie teaching children, but especially girls, that they have to find themselves and have the courage to challenge unfair rules. Fair enough, but how can someone who's the ""chosen one"" ever find herself? Basically, she'll have to find what she was chosen for. By trying to play on every possible safe side, the film never finds its places and ends up delivering more messages than Western Union. And these messages don't necessarily speak the truest statements about life, if you're going to convince children that everything is possible if you put your mind to it, you can't teach them that ""trying"" is the most important thing. How about a Disney movie where 'failure' can be an option? At least, they can try that with a male character if they're afraid of some backlash.To be fair about the movie, I enjoyed the visuals, but we know it's the common denominator of most Disney movies, even ""Finding Dory"" looked great, but the plot was rather thin. What's ""Moana"" got to offer? Sure, I loved the immersion into Hawaiian culture and traditions. It's true Moana succeeds in giving us a Hawaiian flavor from the start but for the most part, the film is an adventure above the sea which isn't the most original setting, and apart from the traditional songs (nothing new since ""The Lion King"") and the colorful look, we could have a movie set inside the island, giving much latitude to the Hawaiian tradition, instead of the usual ""native"" narrative defined in terms of unfair tradition, relationship with Mother Nature and a young daughter who wants to challenge. To be honest, this has become a bit too predictable and the film can only follow the same series of patterns. It becomes all a matter of ""posture"".Dwayne the Rock Johnson and Auli'lCaravalho provide the voices of the heroic pair, and as much as I loved their work, especially some singing moments, I was wondering why the 'Marketing' was so insistent on their background? So Dwayne, a native Samoan dubs the voice of Maui, and Caravalho is a true native. But was Disney afraid of being accused of vocal white-washing? Did Johnson have a Hawaiian accent? And would have accent been accepted or criticized for being too stereotypical? I don't know but I guess it's just to prevent some criticism, and they were certainly right. The film didn't even escape from controversy when they launched the 'Moana' costume. But I guess it shows that no matter how critical we are toward the film, it reacts properly to the mood of its era.Now, I'm looking forward to discovering ""Coco"". Finally a movie about a boy! Sorry, but since Disney is supposed to awaken an inner child, mine happens to be a boy and maybe this girl-power stuff is making the boy inside me feel more insecure or jealous. So I don't mind a girl power movie once in a while but in that case, I wish Disney could... let it go!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Moana is a family friendly must watch,"The movie Moana starts off like many other Disney movies: thus setting the stage for the rest of the movie. Moana starts off as little girl and you soon see that she, like many other princesses, is aspiring to be something her family and society doesn't want her to be. This is a very similar idea to the movie Mulan in which she joins the Chinese army even though it was man's job and proceeded to win the support of her people and everyone was happy. So when the movie Moana started in a similar fashion I was hesitant that it would be a stale Mulan-ish re run. However, I was pleasantly surprised. Moana is a fun, cute, feel good movie that was enhanced by the plot, voice actors, and fluid script that I would recommend for all ages. For starters Moana's unpredictable plot is intriguing due to the unknown element of the ocean exploration. The movie incorporates the unpredictability of the ocean by making Moana curious about it from the time she was born thus conveying the unpredictable plot while at sea. These multiple unexpected setbacks that occur on the ocean enhance the plot and makes it less cookie cutter. However, one down side is since this is a Disney movie there has to be a happy ending because it's Disney and they aren't going to make a children's princess movie have a sad ending. Another factor that made Moana an exciting movie was the voice actors for the characters. Especially Dwayne Johnson because his voice and tone fit the character Maui perfectly. Maui is a very large, muscular, stocky man and Dwayne Johnson is a large man in real life too so it was natural for him to play the role. The confident and deep tone he read Maui's lines with was very accurate to the stereotypical big macho man, but he also made his voice soft enough that it wasn't frightening to young children who make up the majority of the audience for Moana. Auli'I Cravalho also did a very good and appropriate vocal acting job for the audience as well. She used a very energetic and inspiring tone when Moana was trying to convince Maui to come with her on the adventure. As well as used a sterner tone when things started to get out of control. However, my favorite voice actor was Rachel House who played the old grandma Tala. Her tone was spot on with an old knowledgeable grandma. This was displayed by her compassionate and shaky voice which typically signifies wisdom. Overall the voice actors preformed their roles well and added to the movie's positives. Lastly Moana had a script that just flowed with the movie and didn't seem too cheesy. The dialogue was also not too complicated or hard to follow either since it was intended for a younger audience. For example, Moana's dialogue with Maui was childish and filled with simplified words that displayed frustration instead of using super complex words to get the same emotions involved. By doing this it actually made it more enjoyable for an older viewer as well because it was very easy to understand and was sort of a childish throwback tying it all together. All in all, I would recommend Moana for anyone under the age of 10 or wanting to relive a little portion of childhood. Between the heartwarming warming plot, emotionally touching voice actors and childish script Moana was a solid Disney film. I would rate it 7/10 stars and would say it is worth the watch for all ages.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beautiful story,"It has a carefully crafted, beautiful story full of valuable messages for young minds. The story is zestful and non repetitive which makes it a joy ride. Soundtrack is also very good. We are still listening it almost every day with our kid.It's not a cliche love story, not full of stereotypes and definitely not an meaningless action pack.We really liked the warm, meaningful story and valuable messages for kids (and adults) inside.

my favvv ever,"""Moana"" tells the story of a young Polynesian girl who embarks on a daring journey across the ocean to save her island from ecological disaster. Along the way, she encounters the demigod Maui, who reluctantly helps her on her quest to restore the heart of Te Fiti, a goddess who created all life. The film is a celebration of Polynesian culture, showcasing stunning oceanic landscapes and traditional music. ""Moana"" is more than just a hero's journey; it's a story about self-discovery and the courage to go against the tide. The animation is breathtaking, with the ocean itself almost becoming a character. Additionally, the film's soundtrack, particularly the song ""How Far I'll Go,"" is both uplifting and memorable, making ""Moana"" a standout in Disney's animated lineup.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great Children's Film,"As a passionate lover of classic Disney Movies, I haven't been as excited about the newer CGI Disney movies as I should be. Although Moana was a wonderful film with exciting action sequences, lovable characters, and catchy tunes thanks to Lin Manuel-Miranda's more modern approach to music, it somehow lacks the movie magic that Disney used to constantly deliver on in the past. However, if you truly enjoy films like Tangled, Frozen, or Brave, then Moana is definitely the movie for you. Moana is still lighthearted, fun, and of course delivers a valuable message to anyone looking for strength. You and your kids are sure to get some enjoyment out of this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
I do watch that all day,"The daughter of a village chief goes on a seafaring adventure.Moana is a strong Disney feature film with great voice performances and beautiful animation.The story is a pretty standard Disney formula, with familiar stock characters like the controlling parent and self-obsessed princess-type lead. However, it unfolds in a generally entertaining mcguffin-driven adventure story that has a good positive conclusion.I enjoyed the songs, which are catchy and very much enhance the movie's potential to be rewatched. My two young daughters both love them all, particularly Your Welcome. I think my favourite is We Know The Way as it works fantastically in two brilliant sequences of storytelling.I'm no expert on Polynesian cultures, so how it came across to people in the pacific islands makes interesting reading. The seafaring aspects of the story are some of the most exciting and were well received, as was Moana as a character. However, some of the stereotypical presentations such as Maui, Tala, the Kakamora and the obsession with coconuts is questionable.Dwayne Johnson to me is entertaining as Maui, but I am speaking as a forty-something, white male who watches the movie primarily for the enjoyment of children. If he is offensive to Polynesian communities, who am I to argue otherwise? There is no denying his voice performance is excellent and so is that of Auli'i Cravalho.The biggest draw for me is the animation, which is quite breathtaking in every way. The colour, texture, lighting, detail, scope and general artistic quality is awesome. The animation of water in 'Finding Nemo' impressed me when it first came out, but Moana is at another level.My two year old is obsessed with 'Moana' and makes me watch it repetitively, so it is starting to lose its appeal unfortunately.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A worthy addition to Disney's princess canon,"While Walt Disney Animation Studios have been providing escapism for both children and adults since the 1930s, their attitudes towards more 'exotic' cultures and portrayal of certain racial stereotypes - especially in their early days - have always raised an eyebrow. Perhaps this is why they are now leading the charge in diversity, and after gobbing up billion-dollar franchises and taking them underneath their wing are now dishing up hugely successful blockbusters led by strong-willed heroines and multi-ethnic ensembles. Following the unexpectedly poignant Zootopia earlier this year, the studio have struck gold once again with Moana, a dazzling if comfortable step back into more traditional Disney territory.As the daughter of chief Tui (Temuera Morrison) of the Polynesian island Motunui, the young and naturally curious Moana (Auli'i Cravalho) has a duty to remain with her family to watch over her people. But she has dreams of sailing out to sea to explore the unknown lands beyond the horizon, and it would seem that the sea agrees with her, as it parts to reveal a precious stone early on before her father insists that she return home. The island has always provided everything the inhabitants need to survive and flourish, but without warning, fish numbers are starting to dwindle and the coconuts are rotting, and it would seem that an age-old fable of the theft of island goddess Te Fiti's heart is to blame. The story names powerful demigod Maui as the thief, and tells how he was later shipwrecked by a lava demon after losing the heart and his magical fish hook. Defying her father's wishes, Moana goes in search of Maui to restore the heart and save her island from starvation.Written by, amongst others, Disney legends Ron Clements and John Musker, Moana is incredibly straight-forward, reaching back to the likes of The Little Mermaid (1989), Aladdin (1992) and Hercules (1997) for a proved formula that served them so well during the studio's renaissance. The film often reflects on this, with Maui (voiced by Dwayne Johnson, who always sings and does it well) pointing out that although she may not be a princess per se, she has the look, spirit and animal sidekick to fit the profile. It doesn't take long to pick up on the fact that you're not watching anything striving for originality, but you'll be too taken aback by the gorgeous visuals on show and the stellar voice acting bringing these familiar Disney archetypes to life to care. Very much a warmer companion piece to Frozen (2013), Moana feels both classical and very modern.Also like Frozen, there are many memorable tunes to enjoy, here by Broadway composer and playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda and Oceanic musician Opetaia Foa'i, although none of which will reach the dizzy heights of 'Let It Go'. One particularly toe-tapping number comes from Jemaine Clement as a treasure-hording crab, whose unmistakably Flight of the Conchords-esque twang may suggest he had more input that simply providing the vocal chords. Yet for all the jaw-dropping animation and comic relief prat-falls of pet rooster Heihei (Alan Tudyk), the main strength of Moana is Moana herself; stubborn, intelligent and incredibly capable, she doesn't rely on men to save the day, nor does she get distracted by a love interest. It's here that Disney manage to subtly subvert expectations without rubbing your face in it, creating a well-rounded and believable character in the process. An extremely worthy addition to Disney's princess canon, Moana proves that a dose of heart and imagination can reignite even the most done-to-death of formulas.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

The Vidiot Reviews...,"MoanaThe best thing about growing up on an island is that it prepares you for if ever you get deserted on one.However, the princess in this animated-musical sees no benefit to island living.The daughter of a domineering chieftain, Moana (Auli'i Cravalho) yearns to stray beyond the coral borders of her Polynesian community, but her father forbids voyages abroad for fear of sea-monsters.When she uncovers the real reason behind the leviathans and of her tribe's seafaring legacy, Moana and her pet rooster set sail to capture a shapeshifting demigod (Dwayne Johnson) and liberate an island deity from captivity.Although it does not stray far from the typical Disney princess story standards – an animal sidekick, an overprotective father and a bevy of songs - it does however do a commendable job incorporating those criteria in an amusing fashion.Incidentally, shapeshifting is most useful when you can't find a washroom.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Take aways from Moana,"1. Another Disney princess story? Seems like they care less about originality and more on selling merchandise. 2. On the other hand, Disney's first Polynesian princess. 3. Coconut pirates? Really?? 4. That ocean is way too blue. 5. For a PG rated film, the dialogue was at a preschool level. 6. The coconut crab's song was more of an insult than a tribute to the late David Bowie. 7. The climax scene was dramatically appealing and amazing. 8. The Oscars totally blew it by nominating the song ""How Far I'll Go"" instead of ""We Know the Way."" Someone must have mislabeled that mixtape. 9. Retitle this movie to ""The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker"" and this would have been totally awesome!",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney's best,"Moana takes the high quality Disney magic of their renaissance era and only modernises it further by increasing its title character's agency and the overall representation for an all time great animated movie. It's an exciting adventure and thoughtful coming of age story that has plenty of epic spectacle throughout and is inhabited by characters who are so loveable and given plenty of room to grow. This is everything Disney animation excels at distilled into their finest film.Auli'i Cravalho is incredible as Moana. She has loads of enthusiasm from the start without the necessary skills so as she gains confidence in what she's able to achieve over the course of her journey, it results in a very satisfying character arc where her voicework makes the character growth just as strong as everything happening on screen. She imbues every song with so much emotion, especially How Far I'll Go which has a real yearning to it.Dwayne Johnson gets a role big and strong enough for his ego but at the same time it's his best performance since Pain & Gain and possibly his all time best. His movie star charisma is stronger than ever, he's really funny and there's added vulnerability and character flaws that he rarely allows himself to show. Plus his chemistry with Auli'i Cravalho is strong too as he starts off incredibly cynical and then warms to her in a heartwarming fashion.Directors John Musker & Ron Clements pull off the impressive feat of moving between musical numbers in quick succession without it feeling rushed. The animation is reliably faultless as it allows itself to be playful whilst maintaining a high level of detail. Since a large majority of the film takes place on the water, it's undoubtedly the most breathtakingly beautiful aspect in its detail and vibrancy as well as becoming a fun supporting character.The songs by Lin-Manuel Miranda, Mark Mancina and Opetaia Foa'i are amazing as each one is extremely catchy and memorable, communicating everything about the characters singing them with a superb rhythm. This is Miranda and Disney songs in peak form. Mark Mancina's score brings a sense of wondrous adventure and is infused with Polynesian culture from the very start, just like everything else.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Moana is good, nothing great, nothing bad, just good","I was interested in seeing Moana already for the concept and that it is directed by one of my favorite directors Ron Clements and John Musker who give me movies that i loved like Treasure Planet and Aladdin. And when i saw it, it didn't disappoint me. The best thing is the animation. Is the most beautiful animation i ever seen in a Disney movie. The water, the characters designs and Moana expressions are the most watchable thing i ever see. The characters are decent expect Moana and Maui who i think are the most likable. Moana as a character is so pretty, more that the rest of Disney Princess. Maui is a little bit annoying in the beginning, but then he most likable in the rest of the film and it has some of the funniest lines in the movie. The movie has more jokes that in any Disney princess movies and sometime is hilarious. The songs are good, 3 of them are fantastic and the rest are OK or unnecessary in the film. And the last good thing in the film are the voice cast who the most part is phenomenal. Auli'i Cravalho as his first role is so beautiful and fantastic that who she did the voice of Moana and Dwayne Johnson is funny as Maui. But the film has some troubles in the writing like some clichés or conveniences that happens in the film. Some jokes are not funny when is gross humor. And the crab villain is not funny or interesting and makes the movie boring. And some of the song are unnecessary. But overall, Moana is better movie that Frozen o Tangled in respect of characters or writing. Is not better that Zootopia, but is enjoyable for everyone.7.4/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Moana is a fantastic addition to the Disney Princess line, and is a loveable and relatable character. Also love the chicken sidekick and Maui, they're absolutely hilarious.

A Satisfying Magical Resurrection of A Long Lost Culture,"Faithful to the tradition of Disney's renaissance era, Moana takes audiences of all ages on a journey with a resourceful young woman who learns her place in the world. Parents will love the tribute toward Polynesian culture, while kids will love the fantastical journey made complete with a fresh color palette. Other than an inappropriately placed gag about urination, Moana has established itself as yet another family-friendly hit by the Disney studio within their CGI renaissance.The wide range of animation styles explored here starts with a two- dimensional storytelling of what Polynesian religion believes brought the islands into existence. In what appears to be a moving tapestry, a wise, grandmotherly voice-over tells us of Mother Island, who raised islands out of the sea and then rested among them. That is, until Maui the shapeshifting demigod stole her heart. Along his path away from Mother Island, he lost the heart, as well as his fish hook that allows him to shapeshift.Then the animation style switches to the traditional computer animation, where an elderly storyteller is speaking to her grandchildren about the story. The one seated in the middle of the pack, the heroine of our story, immediately goes out onto the seashore, where the miraculously animated living water leads her through conch shells to the heart of Mother Island itself: the ocean called her to restore peace to the land.Then this toddler grows up to become Moana, daughter of the chief who wishes to sway away from their traditional ways in order to explore the world. She's a typical kid's movie heroine we've seen countless times before, and her motive to defy authority is not a good message for our kids, but the empowering musical voice by Auli'i Cravalho plenty makes up for that.Her grandmother pushes her to follow the calling by the ocean to find Maui the demigod so that she can help him retrieve his fish hook and return the heart to Mother Island. It follows out of the tradition followed by her people, as they are not voyagers; but their long-forgotten ancestry says otherwise. Therefore, Moana goes out on the quest, with a google-eyed, dim-witted chicken as her sole companion.Then she meets Maui himself, voiced with a lovable laid-back nature by Dwayne Johnson. He adds the familiar heart and soul expected from any Disney feature, as his tattoos move individually to express his true feelings.Now with the demigod on her voyage, Moana travels elsewhere to find his hook and get to Mother Island. Such stops include an underwater world of fantasy that houses a giant gold-crazy hermit crab. He is not one of the more tolerable portions of the adventure though, as his modes of dialogue includes rambling without a clear punchline to whatever joke he's attempting to deliver, and an out of place song sung in the style of Paul McCartney.This is among one of the other songs that simply sound odd in melody. Even so, there are several hits in the score, including Moana's single ballad, ""How Far I'll Go,"" and the catchy ""We Know the Way,"" both of which are guaranteed Oscar nominations. Yet none of these songs will catch on as one of Disney's iconic tunes. In addition, anytime the characters are not singing, they are blatantly telling us through not-so-subtle foreshadowing what will happen later on.Another thing that is difficult to grasp about Moana is the big ""so what"" of its celebration towards pagan religion. While yes, we should never be afraid to learn about other cultures and their backgrounds, depicting their gods as truth is not the answer to learning about who these people are. I would like for Disney to someday make a big leap in exploring and faithfully retelling the way those of another culture live their day to day lives, as to make up for their poor treatment of non-White races in the past.I cannot see Moana becoming a celebrated classic like Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, or The Little Mermaid, nor can I see it largely influencing pop culture like Frozen or Zootopia, but it is still a fresh adventure for the young and young at heart to get the ideal expected Disney experience.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Perfection,"I watched it again recently after recalling how much I loved when I grew up, and I'm so happy it didn't disappoint me even after all those years.The story is so interesting and fun, the Polynesian theme(which I don't know how accurate it is but I'll exclude it from this review) was adding a lot to the movie, the characters are so full of depth and emotionally complicated, the goofy moments also add a lot of humor and fun to the film, the Pixar animation is always a fun time and well, the music of the film is just of one of the best soundtrack of any movie I've seen as I still listen to the songs since I saw it for the first time.I seriously cannot express how much I love this movie, this might also be because of some bias but it's not too bad, Just a fantastic film and experience.The next challenge to not be ruined by the live action :)",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

In other words, they will be known for a few months, maybe up to a year, but will be fading thereafter.The imagines are great. High definition, vivid, like always from Disney.

"Five-Word Review: Exquisite, Enjoyable Fun; Somewhat Unoriginal","Moana continues the recovery Disney has enjoyed this decade. Hawaiian Auli'i Cravalho voices the titular not-a-princess, who sets off on a quest to find demigod Māui (Dwayne Johnson) and restore life to the islands and oceans of Polynesia.Moana has received a lot of critical acclaim for being fun, witty, and different, and overall it is pretty good. The voice work is stellar, with Johnson excelling at Māui's cocky bravura but also bringing depth to the role, and this should be a solid start for Cravalho. Jemaine Clement, however, steals the show, his unique voice instantly recognisable as a villainous and boastful crab.The music overall is simply wonderful. The influence of lyrical genius Lin-Manuel Miranda is clear, with some catchy and memorable songs, with stand-outs being Clement's and Johnson's songs.The very best thing is the animation, however - the best I've ever seen in a film. The water looks simply dazzling, surpassing anything seen in Finding Nemo/Dory. The final effect is an absolutely breath-taking aesthetic, and it's simply marvellous how much animation has progressed.It's also quite funny: at times self-referential (even too much in bits) and guaranteed to muster a chuckle. All in all it's quite a fun time and shows Disney reaching a scale close to that achieved by Pixar, even if it ultimately doesn't offer much new and maybe won't linger so long in the memory. 73/100",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
MOANA - 8/10 - DISCOVER. WHO. YOU. ARE.,"... this movie still splashes. Wow...ORIGINAL - PROPHETIC - TIMELESS - PURE... a chieftain princess from the Polynesian islands... what could be more original than that...I remember being so impressed by Disney Animation Studios that they produced such an original story. A shocking EIGHT YEARS later, it doesn't feel a day over brand new. Moana is everything the Disney Princess genre (yes, it's a subgenre) needed... and still needs. A completely original princess.With a very small cast, Moana and Maui carry this story. They have ample screentime to develop full character arcs; we really see her grow up. The few characters make this no less grand of a film. The literal ocean is filling the screen... but Moana taking it on alone keeps things intimate.Conceptually, a masterpiece. Moana has this magic and mythology - but it's so grounded; the ancestral vision, her grandmother's visitation, Maui's fish hook. None of it is fancy or ""sparkly"".The visual language of the film is beautiful. You can basically feel the saltwater spray on your skin and the hot sun on your face. The shot of the seashell atop the stack of stones will always be a favorite.To the point of language - beautifully crafted songs, bravely written not just in English, but in the native tongue as well. Both languages flowing together to create the soundscape of Moana. It makes you want to learn Samoan just to nail the lyrics. Shiny is definitely the weak point in the film... it's not the best song, and the character is silly. We're literally in the Realm of Monsters. This whole scene could have gone so much harder. It's a Disney kids movie though...... can we take a minute to talk about the Ocean character? No lines. No voice. No freaking FACE. And yet masterfully animated to play a significant, God-like role in Moana's story. That's animation at its finest.The climax of this story will always stand as a deeply prophetic moment in film. It is BRILLIANT scriptwriting. They set up the villain in the opening monologue with a red herring, that sets up the huge reveal at the end. Moana displays incredible courage and insight to realize what actually happened and who she is really facing... who isn't a villain at all. In that aspect, there is an underlying antihero theme of sorts to the film. We discover that the ""villain"" isn't a villain after all... just a wounded character acting in desperation to get what she needs. With prophetic sight, Moana sees this truth and understands what she's been chosen for.This film's returns us to the heart of Disney, giving us a new tale that will no doubt become a timeless classic.P.s. Loved catching the film references this rewatch - Godzilla-esque creature in the Realm of Monsters; ""let her come to me"" reminiscent of the parting of the Red Sea from The Prince of Egypt; Maui's giant hawk flight through the jagged peaks, echoing Test Flight from How To Train Your Dragon. Did I miss any?",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney's Usual Top-Quality,"Moana is, in many ways, exactly what you'd expect from a 'Disney Princess' movie. It's story follows the fundamental formula that has done Disney so well for decades, mixing in Polynesian mythology to spice it up a bit. We have our titular heroine, born into a place of responsibilities, embarking on a journey of self-discovery to save her people, with the help of comic companions and fantastical entities. I mean, it's Disney, this is what they do, time and time again, so I won't judge too harshly. Although there is no love interest - no prince - and that was certainly a welcome diversion from the formula.Of course what sets Moana apart is it's setting and mythology. The world is dying because Te Fiti, the goddess of life, has lost her heart, stolen by ""hero of men"" Maui. Moana is chosen by the ocean to find Maui and together bring the heart back to Te Fiti, and stop the death and decay encroaching on her island. While it's fundamentally full of tropes and clichés, a lot of mythology across the world is full of the same stories supplanted with different characters. Is Moana an accurate representation of this culture? Maybe, I'm not exactly an expert, but the directors did go out of their way to research this world of islands and ocean, so I'm inclined to believe it's reasonably respectful.The animation manages to bring this paradisaical world to life with vibrant colours and beautiful landscapes. This is Disney, so of course the animation is super top-quality. There really isn't much to fault. I didn't notice it particularly breaking any new ground, but the sheer attention to detail paid to the ocean waves, the grains of sand, Maui's skin, and Te Fiti in general were certainly impressive sights to behold. Most noticeably it's not all CGI. All the tattoos are hand- drawn, which makes Maui's little tattoo companion all the more impressive. There's also a scene late into Maui's introductory song where the backdrop is 2D animation, which helped it stand out as a scene, but I'm not entirely it worked from a visual stand point, as Maui and Moana remain in 3D and stick out really obviously.The songs were a bit of a disappointment. Disney is usually great with their musical choices, but Moana's songs just lacked something. It didn't help that the characters constantly pointed out that they were singing, or saying they wanted to avoid another song. It took me out of the immersion even further than the actual Musical elements themselves. For me, I was looking forward to some songs in a Polynesian style, or at least Hawaiian, with ukuleles and other indigenous instruments and vocal methods. Instead each song sounded like normal run-of-the- mill American pop songs, generic and safe, and only marginally catchy.Tamatoa's song was super reminiscent of David Bowie in a homage to the late musician, which in itself is great, but it felt misplaced in this movie, and in the pool of Disney Villain songs, is probably one of the weakest of the lot. Maui's song was probably my favourite, and hearing Dwayne Johnson actually sing was definitely a welcome surprise. That said, and this is a niggle from a musically trained ear, the amount of auto-tune he required was painfully obvious, particularly during the chorus. Moana's song was quite enjoyable, and it's reprise late in the movie was really cool, highlighting the development she has endured as a character on this journey, but it wasn't particularly catchy. It's certainly not even in the same league as Let it Go, or Be My Guest, or Defeat the Huns, or any of the timeless classic musical numbers Disney have had.The voice acting was really good, again unsurprising coming from Disney. I will say though, the choice of casting is a landmark for a blockbuster family movie, or any big budget movie for that matter. Almost every member of the cast has pacific heritage, be it Hawaiian or Maori, and while that ultimately doesn't account for much when all you get of them is their voices, it was nonetheless a fantastic choice behind-the-scenes that I cannot commend Disney for enough. Dwayne Johnson proves once again that he is so underrated as an actor. He's more than just an ex-wrestler. His voice performance as Maui is definitely one of the high points of the entire movie, perfectly embodying the peak and troughs of Maui's egotistical, but fundamentally golden hearted personality. Auli'i Cravalho is also pretty great as Moana herself, showing a surprising amount of talent in this field for someone her age, but her voice wasn't anything particularly special, making the big fuss about the search for her feel a little pointless and over-inflated. She sounds just like every other Disney heroine. The supporting cast is all great as well, including Temuera Morrison as Moana's father, Nichole Scherzinger as her mother (although I'm not sure she had more than a couple of lines?), Rachel House as her grandmother, Alan Tudyk's clucking and squawking as her chicken companion, and Jermaine Clement's shiny giant crab of the underworld (marking the second time in the last few days I have mistaken his voice for Jason Flemyngs).Moana is definitely a Disney movie, with high quality animation, song-work, and voice acting. It's story follows the usual formula with just a handful of twists and new approaches, supplanted to a unique and fairly unknown mythology. In the grand scheme of things, Moana isn't anything special. It will sink into the gloop of really well made Disney that fails to really stand out. I give it an enjoyable 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Best Mythological Animation? Yes!,"I have a big interest for mythology, especially Polynesian. This Disney animation brings these things together and made one of my most favorite movies ever. I can watch it over and over again and never get bored. It is a masterpiece. I liked how they use mythological elements in a fictional story and make an amazing result. There is no love, no princess at all (it's controversial even in the movie) but it is still perfect as a Disney movie. I am an English teacher, and this movie will be my first choice for my students to watch in our no-lesson time. It basically teaches to never give up, trust yourself and love your people you live with.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Enjoyable! But it's way too Disney,"If there's such a crime for being too Disney, MOANA would be guilty of it. Now, before you attack me with torches and pitchforks, let me say that I enjoy this film, but in the traditional Disney animation sense, it really doesn't get more generic or more formulaic than MOANA.Directed by the team who gave us ""The Little Mermaid,"" ""Aladdin,"" ""Hercules,"" and ""The Princess And The Frog,"" Ron Clements and John Musker this time take us to the islands of oceania, across the vast pacific where a teenager named Moana, wonderfully voiced by newcomer Auli'i Cravalho, dreams of voyaging across the open sea, just like her people's ancestors did. Her father however, the head chief, doesn't want that for his daughter, he wants her safe. But under the guidance of her late grandmother, Moana decides to venture off in order to find the demigod Maui, voiced by Dwayne Johnson, who years ago stole a certain object that would restore Moana's island that's being threatened by a curse. On this adventurous journey, Moana and Maui encounter obstacles along the way, find strength in each other's confidence and fulfill their destiny.I admit, a big part of why I was looking forward to this film is to listen to the new music, the original new songs by Lin-Manuel Miranda, Mark Mancina and Opetaia Foa'i. And they did not disappoint us. All of the songs for this film should be nominated for Oscar, they're so lively, they fit the whole theme about legacy, and they're just extremely catchy, and the music sounds very islander too, I think if you're a cinephile or a Disney fan that comes from that part of the world, you'll immediately fall in love with the songs in MOANA, I guarantee it.As far as the characters and the story go, as I said earlier, MOANA is quite formulaic, I know some people might use the 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' argument and to a certain extent, yes if it has worked in the past, then why change it. Obviously Ron Clements and John Musker are representative of Disney cinema, and they consistently take that with them from one movie to the next. So there's song and dancing, there's spiritual guidance, there's a sidekick pet, there's supernatural magical elements, and there's a giant arrogant but lovable friend and of course, our lead hero ultimately discovers his or her true identity. It's as if there's a specific equation that Clements and Musker always come back to and would never ever deviate from. I give MOANA a million credit for giving us Disney's first islander princess, we definitely needed one, you can always count me in for diversity. But if you've come to see a more original or a different kind of Disney movie, you'll have a better chance with 'Zootopia.' If you've come just for a good old fashioned Disney movie that's pretty safe and very familiar and fun for the whole family, then enjoy MOANA.-- Rama's Screen --",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Copy-paste plot, generic Americanized ""sassy"" characters and witless, frenetic action and dialog","This was much worse than I expected - the heroine Moana is written and acted as a generic American teenager, and while the scenes on her home island are OK (her grandmother is the best character), the scenes between Moana and Maui (which make up the bulk of the film) are tiresome - incessant capers and unfunny sassy banter in place of naturalistic dialog. The film seems to assume children are dumb and have zero attention span, or that boys will be bored by a film with a girl as the lead, so as a result, the midsection of the film in particular is bogged down by an endless series of gags, pratfalls and pointless action scenes. The final confrontation with the monster is also too scary for the age group the film is marketed at. The whole thing is surprisingly charmless and wearisome - I was expecting an enchanting Polynesian-themed fairytale, not a dumbed-down action comedy. A missed opportunity.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Classic Disney at it's best!,"CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERDisney films have always been a childhood favourite for me, from Lion King to Lilo and Stitch to Tangled (Even the princess ones, even though I'm a guy :) So when I heard about Moana, I knew I had to see it.Moana is an exciting, hilarious, emotional and imaginative film, that while continues a classical Disney formula, it is a great movie nonetheless. Here's why,1st- Moana is an energetic, inquisitive protagonist brimming with life and vitality, who thanks to Auli'i Cravalho's voice acting adds to the colourfulness of the film. Her sidekick Maui, voiced by The Rock is hilarious and charming alongside Moana, there's great back to back chemistry with the characters even in the more quieter, heartfelt moments. There's an underlying vulnerability to Moana and Maui, that's beautiful to watch. Let's not forget about the dim witted chicken, that brings laughs a bundle to the film.There's character traits from previous Disney characters, Anna and Rapunzel in Moana, but Moana is very different.2nd - the animation as with all Disney films as of late with Frozen, Tangled, is beautifully realized. But for Moana, it's a visually dazzling display, the vivid exotic colours and the richness of the Polynesian landscapes, the seas, the islands, the culture, monsters is a beauty to behold. It's full of extravagance and vitality.3rd - the deep rooted use of Polynesian Culture, important to Moana's story is richly engaging and adds depth to the film. Her culture is what defines her, which is brilliant message for viewers (such as myself), for audiences yearning for more ethnically diverse Disney characters it is heartening to see a protagonist who's culture is deeply important to who they are. I know Disney have done cultural characters before, Princess and the Frog, Pocahontas, Mulan but here I genuinely feel there's respect and authenticity to the treatment of her culture, not tired and lazy stereotypes. Here's to more ethnically diverse characters in the future.Lastly, there's tender heartfelt moments where Moana feels incapable and hopeless on her journey , which we all feel sometimes, but she refuses to give up and carries on, which is inspiring and made me tear up a little. As well as other themes of identity, knowing who you are and what you want to be, are all great morals too.Moana's got heart, emotion, humour, character, story, beautiful visuals, morals. Moana is everything you want a Disney film to be and more! As Maui would say ""Your Welcome!""",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
The best Disney Animated Movie I have seen in a while!,"This week we were given the opportunity to attend an advanced screening of Disney's newest film ""Moana"".What we loved about the film:The cast is incredible! Auli'i Cravalho and Dwayne Johnson are wonderful and you can feel the pride in their voices as they represent their Hawaiian culture - as well as doing justice in serving several other cultures of Oceania throughout this film. They are also supported by the talents of so many others including Jemaine Clement, Temura Morrison, and Nicole Scherzinger.I love the family connections.The connection between Moana and her Grandma Tala was one I really felt strongly in my heart. Her mother understanding that she needed to go even though her father didn't approve. Her father welcoming her home with open arms even though she went against his wishes. It was all really powerful. A wonderful message of encouragement and forgiveness. She is also lifted up as a leader. She is given the chance to make decisions for her people. They trust her. It was incredible and wonderful!The soundtrack is incredible! ""Moana"" features original songs from a team that includes Lin-Manuel Miranda, Mark Mancina and Opetaia Foaʻi. My husband isn't a great fan of ""all of the singing"" (not a musical theater kind of guy) but even he said this music was pretty good.The chicken, Hei Hei, is hilarious and wonderful. As my husband says, ""stupid chicken jokes just never get old"". It was serious comic relief and we all decided he was probably our favorite part of this movie. The Ocean also plays a huge role in the film and brought humor as well as empathy and you see the relationship build as the movie goes on.Moana is an incredibly strong main character and young woman. She is not a princess - she says this in the film. This didn't feel like a princess movie to me, which I was so grateful for. I have struggled through several of them lately - just never been a ""princess"" person. That said Princess lovers will not be disappointed. Moana is a leader. She is a voyager. She is a hero. She is what every girl should aspire to! She is what I aspire to be! There is no love story here - other than her love of the ocean, nature, her family, her people, and eventually herself. She saved as much as she was saved and I found that so refreshing! She is fiercely independent and supported by all of the women in her life. She becomes a hero by learning and being open to situations. She thinks things through and problem solves. She is a force, yet is gentle and understanding and with all of these traits you fall in love with her and cheer her on. She has moments of weakness and finds the strength to overcome them.I love that she looks like a real person proportionally. She is thin, but isn't rail thin like all of the princesses. I felt like I was looking at a real person rather than a stick figure that could easily be snapped in two. Thank you for that Disney!The message of trying to save our oceans and earth is strong and wonderful. I also love the idea that the ocean doesn't separate us, but connects us. That is so powerful and if we thought like this more I think greater respect would be paid to one of the biggest givers of life our planet has.I love the cultural message that ties several of the cultures throughout the Pacific together in this film. It was really lovely too. Disney and the film makers traveled to several island nations to bring Oceania's legends to life in this film. They share their rich oral histories as well as the traits the people have used for centuries. Moana's main outfit was designed so it would be suitable for an adventurer. Neysa Bové, the costume designer made sure the skirt has a slit in front to allow movement— whether she's swimming, running or navigating her canoe. So much thought was put into the development.We highly recommend this film! My son says, ""boys will really like it a lot because it isn't a princess movie and there is plenty of action plus the chicken is so funny"". I say moms and dads will like it a lot because it is funny, there are several great messages, and it has a little something for everyone! In my opinion this is one of the best Disney animated films I have seen in a while.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Spectacular animation, beautiful and fun characters, wonderful story","I could feel the warm breeze blowing through my hair, the fresh air and the smell of the ocean. The animation is incredible. The characters are fun, energetic, believable and just make you feel happy. Moana's adventure with the help of the dem-god Maui is inspirational humorous and genius.The cast is magnificent. A young girl named Moana (Auli'i Cravalho) is trying to find out who she is and what her purpose in life should be. Moana is my kind and courageous new princess who longs to do things no one has done before and try the unexpected. I adore her because she is so fun-loving and adventurous. Plus, she reminds me of myself and how I am adventurous and a friend to all. She is a great role model for girls because she learns to do many things she thought she never could. Even when she is scared, she mustards up the courage and conviction she needs. Auli'i Cravalho has the perfect voice for this part which involves many new songs that I loved.The demi-god Maui (Dwayne Johnson) is a perfect choice. He does everything he can to show how awesome and cool he is with his fabulous hook strength, gorgeous hair and good looks. I think he is lovable but he needs a push, or two or three, to do the right thing. Who knew Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) could sing? He can and I enjoyed his songs.The evil crab, Tamatoa (Jemaine Clement) is silly sly and very boastful. Stay after the end credits and you will see the funniest clip ever. You might recognize Jemaine Clement's voice from the movie BFG as one of the giants. He is one of our very odd shinny villains who sings. Gramma Tala (Rachel House) is one of the best Grandmas you will ever meet. She can tell that Moana has a connection to the ocean and she tries to help her fulfill her destiny while avoiding her son, Chief Tui (Temuera Morrison). Moana's father who wants her to stay home to be a princess and take care of the people who are part of their tribe. He learns that he has to let go, listen to his daughter and let her leave the nest and follow her heart and dreams so she can be free doing what she loves.The animation is spectacular with each and in every detail, an animator's passion shows. It makes you feel like you are seeing the ocean and the islands because the vivid and crystal clear rendition. The water at night and the islands are terrific and breathe taking. This stupendous film made me want to go island hopping with Moana and Maui.My favorite scene is when Moana and Maui are on the boat talking and Maui tells Moana a secret about his life. I won't give any spoilers, but this is a scene to watch for. I love it because it is so heart- felt and it just made me want to hug someone, tell them a secret and cry. You can really tell that Moana and Maui have a connection and care for each other deeply.I recommend this for kids age 6 to 18 and adults will enjoy it too. Kids will love the animation and fun-filled characters. There is a crazy chicken that will keep them laughing. The villains are not too scary. They will enjoy the comedy and quick one liners throughout the film. Adults will love the messages, the animation and the story. I give this film 5 out of 5 oceanic waves and stars.",,Anonymous,Animation

Moana a self-discovery journey,"Moana brings the Mulan (1998) formula and it delivers a home-run.The movie begins on a slow pace so you can start getting to know what the character has to deal with in order to get you ready with the main dilemma for Moana which will be to either follow your passion and dreams or be the princess you are supposed to be ignoring your goals, this may be a detractor for some people who likes a fast paced action movie since the beginning.With the newcomer Auli'i Cravalho as the voice of Moana, she did a wonderful job on bringing the character to life and giving it that desire to see her triumph in her journey of self-discovery. We are taken alongside Moana on her growing up phase acting as the teenager she is instead of the grown up they want her to be. This road takes us to meet our main support character which is Maui the demigod voiced by Dwayne ¨The Rock¨Johnson.Dwayne Johnson delivered an incredible voice acting job as Maui, we haven't seen ¨The Rock¨on this type of roles and surprisingly it could be one of his best role in recent years, this said the character Maui also had it's journey to once again know himself and remember who he was and why he did the things he did, this was something that made the character special since on the long run you could also be striving for Maui to change and be better.Now for the movie as a whole it had it's usual clichés every Disney movie has, this movie delivers it's formula with a well thought script and story that it didn't feel as the same thing we have seen even though you may know what it's going to happen.For the songs in the movie they were done perfectly, even though it will not be a trademark song like Frozen (Let it Go), this movie did well to get the children's engaged and sing (I am Moana), but this is not memorable as Frozen at all, so for this category as Best Original Song it's highly unlikely it will win, but it well deserves its nomination, also with the contribution of Lin-Manuel Miranda director of Hamilton in the movie this definitely deserved its spot in the Oscars.With all this said, you will definitely enjoy the journey of Moana and Maui the demigod since the movie delivers well thought songs, a good Disney formula and each of the characters with their own unique personality will engage you in a certain way that you will be rooting for both of them to accomplish their goal and at the end you will be happy with their results.It deserves its solid 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beautiful movie some pacing problems,"I was going to give this movie an 8 then I realized I had given 8 to the little mermaid so this ended up being a 7. Moana is a beautiful movie the animation is AMAZING. The characters are lovable, and the script is pretty good however there are some problems with the pacing. Parts of the movie just felt boring for me and I didn't find the songs to be as stellar as other Disney movies. The most memorable songs for me where ""Where you are"" and Moana's main song but Maui and Tomatoa's songs were slightly annoying. I also enjoyed the cultural aspect of it and the artistic way they depicted Hawaiian culture( although I am not Hawaiian so I'm not sure how culturally accurate this is) it was beautiful. Despite its faults the movie has heart which is something Disney movies have been lacking recently.Summary

she was a little child her father has forbidden her of going in the ocean but she knows that the ocean and,"Movie Review by Nafanua M. Fitisemanu Moana Rated: PG 4.5 stars""Moana"" is an encouraging movie especially for young viewers. The film is a mixture of all polynesian cultures, filled with a variety of songs in multiples languages and ancient legends of demons and demigods. Moana portrays the character of a strong, independent princess who goes through the journey to save her village and to find her true self. Although she is an independent princess there's always her family and friends right by her side to help on her adventure. She also discovers some of her ancestor's history to figure out who she really is. During this movie, Moana is faced with the trial of going against her father's word of going ""beyond the reef"" and to follow her heart. Ever since she was a little child her father has forbidden her of going in the ocean but she knows that the ocean and sea is her home. Later in the movie she comes across more obstacles but overcomes them with the support of her companion Maui. Although this film may have unrealistic or fictional scenes, all viewers can relate to Moana and how she overcomes all of her conflicts. Not only can the viewers relate, they can also learn that some things take a lot of work but you can always push through it with the help of others and with having courage to face your fears. Disney had done an astounding job of portraying the polynesian culture with traditions and music, while still having it simple so that children could still understand and follow along with the plot of the story. I highly recommend you to go and watch this movie, especially with your kids!",,Anonymous,Animation

Moana excels because of its excellent imagery/visuals and wonderful performance/characterisation,"While the trailers did absolutely nothing for me, the film is nothing but a pleasant and enjoyable surprise.Moana's characterisation is top-notch here, evident through the titular character herself; Moana is depicted as a skilled, warm-hearted and kind-natured girl on a journey to discover her true identity, creating an inspiring tale that deserves to be taken to audience's hearts as they did to the female leads of Frozen - if not, even more so because, quite frankly, this is a far superior film. Cravalho's passionate voice performance is magnificent and infectious, making her the perfect fit for the role, coming across a very sweet but headstrong character - very often at the same time. She is one of Disney's most well-defined and sketched characters of all time, with her determination not going unnoticed in a moment of film's entire runtime, giving the film a great focus through and through. Maui is far more one-dimensional than Moana but even he is awarded his own character arc that depicts his realisation that Moana is far more skilled than he gives her credit for, with Johnson capturing his journey with great enthusiasm. The story is one that, although not revolutionary and sometimes in need of a little shake up and few more risks being taken, is an inspiring watch and totally engrossing. Moana's first act features some of the best work in the genre of all time, acting as a masterclass in introducing characters, building a world and setting-up a story without ever overwhelming audiences. A few minutes could be trimmed from the second act, including an entire scene where the pair attempt to recapture Maui's magical fishhook, which feels squarely aimed at younger children while only slowing down the thrill and enchanting journey for everyone else (it feels more Illumination than Disney), but the runtime generally races by in a whirlwind of beauty and inspiration. Its feminist influence, while clear, remain subtle and nuanced enough to avoid feeling completely forced upon audiences, whilst still managing to inspire those smart and mature enough to understand them.FULL REVIEW - http://perksofbeingnath.blogspot.co.uk/2016/12/moana-2016-review.html",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Cliche Disney Formula Still Works - Why Amend It?,"Moana is a traditional Disney animated film. It has everything you'd expect from the studio that has become synonymous with beautiful animation design, generic heroic tales and silly animal sidekicks.It seems at this point, each new Disney animated film is a new skin for the same story. But I cannot bring myself to dislike it. The movie is just so fun that it's impossible to critique the generic storyline and forced plot points. There is literally a wave of water that stops anything interesting or unexpected from happening within the diegesis which is a cool way of saying ""don't expect any surprises"".The thing about Moana is, that despite the barebones story, it's surface is incredibly detailed. It made me immersed in the culture of the island and interested in what life in this society would be like. The little details like drawings and patterns in background shots, to parts of songs being sung in a different language were necessary to making the film distinguishable from something that took less effort to make. This careful planning and attention to detail is something that Disney tend to find success in.The film is also beautiful. The visuals are stunning. The animators did a fantastic job. The score is so fun, though the way music was handled within the film I felt was a little odd. The pacing seemed strange, with many songs appearing in the first act, and then long periods of time between musical interludes in the second and third. Being one of the most appealing parts of the film, I was saddened by this, however, it did make the opening half hour of the film one of the more enjoyable I have seen in recent memory.All in all, Moana is a very fun movie. I can see how adults and kids alike could find enjoyment in it. The voice acting all seemed spot on, and I was pleasantly surprised by how well Dwayne Johnson can sing. Boy, that man really can just do it all can't he. I thoroughly enjoyed Moana, but it is held back in my 7/10 rating due to a slight fatigue in the Disney animated storytelling. I'd like to think that it would get a higher rating from me if I was to focus on it individually and forget the other similar Disney films I have seen; but I'm afraid I cannot. It was a very fun movie, but nothing to tell the grandkids about.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Great visuals, great music.","Moana, while most certainly a cookie-cutter Disney movie, stood out among others with excellent music and even better visuals. The fanciful story follows a young girl, Moana, on her quest to save her island from the mysterious force that is killing all vegetation. The characters in this story suffer from subpar characterization, but as far as children's movies are concerned, this was not unforgivable. The music in this film will, in my mind, be ranked up there with the music found in ""Frozen""- unforgettable and instant classics. In addition, the visuals in this film were absolutely astounding. I found myself caught up in the incredible detail with that animators put into everything. All in all, while the rebellion of the young girl was certainly typical of Disney (and highly irritating for myself), I found the plot to be further from where the company usually ventures, and I found the film entirely refreshing.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Moana Leads us on a Fun Adventure,"Earlier this year, Elizabeth posted an article looking forward to the movie Moana. Despite the aggressively mediocre trailers that Disney had put out, she was excited for the film, and her excitement proved to be well-placed. Moana delivered far more than the lack luster trailers promised.The film follows Moana (Auli'i Cravalho), a spunky princess who leaves her island to embark on an epic quest to return the stolen heart of the Goddess Te Fiti. After forming an alliance with the Demigod Maui (Dwayne the Rock Johnson), the two set off across the seas to find the Goddess. Along they way there are many adventures including a run-in with a giant crab voiced by Jemaine Clement, a lot of laughs, and a whole lot of fantastic music.While the story in Moana isn't revolutionary, Disney is pushing some new ground in other areas. The animation is beautiful, much of the cast and music was created by artists from Pacific Islands (although it was still directed by a couple white guys), Moana is a strong female character drawn in realistic human proportions, and most refreshingly of all there was no love story. While I love Disney's recent push towards less misogynistic films, it seems odd to applaud them for starting to break down stereotypes that they created. Don't get me wrong, Moana is an awesome heroine, but It's sad that we applaud Disney for creating a strong female character who can stand on her own. That should be the expectation, and anything else, anything that hearkens back to the early days of Disney princesses needs to be rejected.There are many many reasons to commend Moana aside from its lack of misogyny. The beautiful animation, the killer score from Lin-Manuel Miranda, Mark Mancina, and Opetaia Foa'i, the consistent jokes, and the stellar voice work add up to an extremely fun movie. Moana doesn't quite stack up to the heights that Disney reached earlier this year with Zootopia, but If you're looking for a pick me up after 2016, this is the movie to grab.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Some problems in the presentation but overall a solid Disney film,"The qualities of Disney films that most people like are sustained in 'Moana' and generally presented with great skill and wit. Auli'i Cravalho handles her debut role excellently, and Dwayne Johnson makes a much better voice actor than I expected. The setting of 'Moana' is fresh and seems to be arranged with integrity and a genuine interest. My only substantial complaint about this film is that the distribution of songs seems somewhat inconsistent, dominating the first half to the extent that the narrative isn't as easily followed as it should be; the world of 'Moana' is harder to break into than those of 'Frozen' and the other recent, memorable Disney films, and so the directors probably should have taken a little more time to explain it to the audience before we hear half a dozen songs. The good in 'Moana' definitely outweighs the bad, though, and my 7/10 rating *almost* became an 8/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Catchy songs and culture with surprises from voice talent,"Moana features catchy songs and fantastic animation in addition to a well crafted story that feels both ancient and modern at the same time. Moana and Maui have excellent chemistry on screen and both Cravalho and Johnson surprised us with their ability to convey humor, emotion and song with their voices. We were glad to see a female protagonist introduced into the Disney universe who wasn't part of a love interest or even have a love interest at all – unless you count a love for her people and the ocean. The movie also does a nice job of conveying Polynesian/Samoan culture and even has a couple of catchy songs sung in Traditional Tokelauan.Overall, Moana is enjoyable and fun to watch – if there was a negative side about the movie it would be that much time is spent with the two characters on a raft and reminded us a bit of the Kevin Costner movie Waterworld. We would have liked to have seen a secondary plot that may have kept us involved for the roller-coaster ride and maybe even some explanation as to the significance of some of the cultural elements germane to the story.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

The voices of both Dwayne Johnson as Maui and Auli'i Cravalho as Moana were an excellent choice. Regarding the direction which was made by Ron Clements and John Musker, it was very good and they both did an amazing job.

"""Moana""-  A solid and entertaining new animated fantasy adventure that's filled to burst with charm.","The advent of high-quality computer animation has brought about a modern wave of fantastic new Disney adventures. From the delightfully quirky ""Tangled"" to the incredibly popular and captivating ""Frozen"", Disney has been hard at work delivering consistently strong and captivating films. 2016's ""Moana"" is Disney's latest installment in their ever-growing filmography, and while it might never quite live up to the highest of standards set by their classics both new and old, it's still very much a thoroughly engaging and entertaining feature.Inspired by Polynesian mythology and culture, we follow Moana (voiced by Auli'i Cravalho), the young daughter of her island's chief, who yearns for something more despite being forbidden from ever going beyond the reef surrounding her home. However, when the plants begin to with and die, leaving her people without a viable source of food, Moana sets out on a grand adventure. She must brave the seas to find the legendary demigod Maui (Dwayne Johnson) and get his help to restore order and save her people by returning the mystical stone heart of the ancient goddess Te Fiti to its original resting place- a stone Maui had stolen hundreds of years ago. Together, the two will brave vile monsters and devious pirate-like creatures along with the deadly wrath of the ocean in order to try and save Moana's home.It's a very simple tale, and that's where much of its charm comes from. A great portion of the film takes place on a raft with only Moana and Maui (along with a hilariously dim-witted chicken that stowed aboard), and thus the film goes through a lot of creative means to develop and endear the characters for the audience. It's bold because the film is so sort-of isolated in it's second and third acts, but it's always consistently amusing and there's plenty of great character-beats to keep the audience giggling at a near- constant pace. I was honestly shocked that Disney was able to make what was essentially over an hour of characters just talking and occasionally stumbling upon a new obstacle so much fun to watch.No doubt another large part of the film's success lies in the delightful cast. Cravalho is an absolute joy as our heroine and will melt your heart in nearly every scene. She also has a nice spunk and drive so she never once becomes the archetypal damsel in distress. This is Disney doing strong female characters just right. Johnson steals the show in just about every scene and is a ton of fun as a sort-of braggart with just enough humanity to keep you rooting for him. Great comedic role that lets Johnson- a pretty talented actor- stretch his chops. Rachel House, Temuera Morrison and Nicole Scherzinger round out the cast in supporting roles that are all lovely and very well- played.The animation and direction is just awe inspiring as well. Even though everything is given that nice, over-stylized Disney look, you still feel very much like everything you're seeing is real. It was stunning just how detailed and true to life the water and sand animation was, and characters are all very well realized with fun designs and great movement. Directors Ron Clements and John Musker, previously responsible for other Disney films like the now-classic ""Aladdin"" and ""Little Mermaid"" have a wonderful dramatic sense of scope and composition, which really hits home with the story being told.While I could bemoan the fact that the film is a slave to formula and has some issues with the pacing in its first act, the fact of the matter is that this is another good, strong effort and continues Disney's winning streak. So I don't mind the issues that are there... it's too much fun to care. It just goes to show that perhaps we are now in the middle of a second renaissance for the company's animation department and that we'll have many more quality films like this to look forward to. I give ""Moana"" a very good 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A must watch, but must not necessarily appreciate.","It's a good movie. The songs are great, better than most Disney films I dare say. There were amazing animations, especially the lightning. The story itself is quite original and inspired, but the movie was too short for good character development. Most of them made me feel like they overreact easily. Also, They cheated on explaining a plausible story with that self-conscious water, it was cheap. Lots of scenes were too fast, couldn't they lengthen it to 130 minutes instead of 107? Beside that, and the subjective likeness of each of us, anyone can appreciate that movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Honestly, I don't get why people liked this movie so much...","I really wanted to like this movie; unfortunately, I see that view is impossible now. So many people gave Moana such wonderful reviews, but I don't understand why. I just don't see how this movie can compare to other Disney movies of its kind. Take Mulan for example--it is one of the best Disney movies of all time. Mulan contains all of the same elements as Moana (hero's journey, animal sidekick, enemy, etc.), Mulan just presents them in a way that is so much more likable to the average human being. I'm not saying that Moana is poorly executed--although it very well could be--I'm just saying that it wasn't a quality movie like Mulan was. Additionally, I found Moana to be boring at times; the plot just seemed to drag on and on. There was so much sailing!",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beautiful Movie,"""Moana"" is an exemplary demonstration of what Disney Animation can pull out at their best. The story is rich in culture and symbols. Characters feel true and develop beautifully. Of course, the visual aspects are beyond belief: every color and texture is vibrant and full of detail.While it does fall into some Disney princess tropes(although we are reminded adamantly that she is not a princess per se but a chief's daughter), there is enough newness to ""Moana"" that it does not feel like a retread. She is rebellious but dutiful, innocent but strong, and the involvement of her (hilarious) animal sidekick is kept to a minimum. What is surprisingly refreshing is that there is no love interest to distract from the main conflict (not that I have any issue with other Disney characters having romantic side-stories).My only critique of ""Moana"" would have to be with it's music. There are some truly wonderful melodies, particularly ""We Know the Way,"" which manages to resonate with all that is wonderful about the music of the pacific. However, I felt some other numbers were not on par with the best of Disney classics. I do not know if Lin-Manuel Miranda was responsible for the lyrics, but whoever was should be told that words do not rhyme with themselves. ""Go"" does not rhyme with ""go,"" and ""island"" does not rhyme with ""island."" Using this sort of rhyming pattern once or maybe a couple times can be bold and memorable, repeatedly just makes it sound like they couldn't come up with better lyrics.Overall, I greatly enjoyed this film. The visuals were incredible, the plot well paced, and the story beautifully told. I had a great time watching ""Moana"" and would recommend it to anyone who does not mind being transported to a magical, tropical paradise for a couple hours.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Another conventional, predictable story that Disney executes incredibly well","The Disney fairytale mold sets sail for Polynesia in ""Moana,"" the studio's latest animated musical featuring a strong female lead character, and a film hoping to build off the success of ""Frozen"" and ""Tangled."" Although audiences are unlikely to be as familiar with ancient Polynesian mythology as they were with the stories of Rapunzel or Hans Christian Andersen, ""Moana"" isn't all that different from these films; Disney has simply dressed its contemporary revamp of the tried and true fairytale formula in oceanic trappings.Although mentioning any kind of formula may seem dismissive or chiding of ""Moana,"" the film absolutely works thanks to a healthy dose of creativity and heart, not to mention self awareness. Despite seven Disney minds claiming a story credit on the film, the studio wisely assigned scripting duties to Jared Bush, writer of its previous 2016 hit, ""Zootopia."" The writing has some of the same edginess, quirkiness and self-awareness of that film (and others) that has allowed Disney's house brand to churn out better films than Pixar of late.Combine that with Disney's longest-working directing duo of Ron Clements and John Musker (""The Little Mermaid,"" ""Aladdin,"" ""Hercules"") and you get an animated feature that's both exciting and different yet fundamentally sound and familiar. Nothing about the ""Moana"" story is surprising. Heard the one about the girl who comes from royalty, has an overprotective father, longs for something beyond what she knows and must go off on an adventure with animal companions and fulfill her destiny? Exactly. But ""Moana"" knows that.In fact, Moana (Auli'i Cravalho) insists she's not a princess. And her problems aren't typical of a princess, specifically that she doesn't want or need to love anyone or marry someone. The movie really centers on her personal adversity. Although she faces some standard Disney conflicts from outside forces including her father's stern rules (Temuera Morrison), a cocky travel partner in demi-god Maui (Dwayne Johnson) and some creatures on her journey, there's no clear villain, at least not one who needs development. Ultimately, she must outlast nature and stand up to or outsmart male characters and believe in herself to succeed. Nicely done, Disney.Yet creativity does more for the movie than feminist underpinnings. Heihei the chicken, the dumbest and strangest animal companion of any Disney movie (voiced of course by Alan Tudyk doing nothing but squawking), provides countless off-beat laughs while Johnson does nicely with the traditional silliness, slapstick and braggadocio humor more common of animated features. The ingenuity of his transformations and tattooed cartoon self being a secondary character help elevate the entertainment in a major way. A second act appearance by Jemaine Clement voicing a giant crab is also a highlight, and his atypical song is absolute brilliance if you listen closely.Riding the waves of success from ""Hamilton: An American Musical,"" composer/songwriter Lin-Manuel Miranda's fingerprints are all over the ""Moana"" soundtrack. His incredible verbal flow is on display in Johnson's song ""You're Welcome"" and the aforementioned Clement song ""Shiny,"" while the film's piece de resistance, ""How Far I'll Go,"" floods the story with emotion each time it shows up in a way that makes ""Let It Go"" feel like a hit song rather than an essential part of ""Frozen.""Even in the form of a predictable story, this degree of heart, in tandem with the visual beauty and creativity, make ""Moana"" another successive hit for Disney. All formulas eventually grow tiresome, and the template that allowed ""Moana"" to thrive will eventually need to be reworked, just as Disney had to do with its animated musicals in the 2000s, but for now it's on a roll.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Great story and songs,"It was my daughter that meant I watched this film - and it was her that has meant that I have watched it at least 20 times now, albeit not always sitting and focused on it as it deserves. The plot sees a non-traditional Disney princess setting out to save her island by crossing the sea to return the heart of a deity and heal the decay. On its face it had the potential to have plenty wrong with it - it could have played heavily on the social inclusion of the non-white princess; it could have been heavy with the environmental message; and it could have been generally too sentimental. Instead it gets the tone completely correct in how it produces an exciting film, with great music, focused around a really strong title character.As a story it has plenty of incident and action, but yet carries off a personal development story just as well as anything else. The most obvious are the two leads, with Moana in particular growing and developing through the film, but I liked very much how little details and touches fill out other characters and created a bigger sense of character. The one that sticks with me the most is the father figure as even before we know anything about his experience at sea, there is an early song with the quick line ""in time you'll learn, just as I did"", which tells us about a certain amount of ""acceptance"" in his life at one point. It is a great line a in a great song and it speaks to the depth and quality in the design of the film.The writing is very good, in dialogue, in narrative sweep, and in the songs. It all comes together with very good voicework from everyone involved, with the high quality of animation making it a very accomplished film. I'm always surprised by how it has the capacity to move me even though it is a children's film that is usually on because the daughter wanted it. Well worth a look even if you don't have children, because there is a lot to recommend about it even for adult viewers.",,Anonymous,Animation

From what I've heard, the cultural depiction is quite accurate and it's has some valuable lessons in it too.Maui might just be my second favorite Disney animated character after the one and only Genie of the Lamp. The songs are incredibly soothing and so good to listen to. The animations are breathtaking as well. If you haven't watched it, I strongly suggest you to check it out with the whole family (Or just by yourself)!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Moana review,"Moana is a film from Disney's revival era revolving around Polynesian culture. I find it's similar to two earlier Disney films: the Little Mermaid and Lilo and Stitch. The Little Mermaid as they both surround the ocean, though the main difference is that Ariel is a Mermaid and lives in the sea and Moana is a human and lives on land. Lilo and Stitch as they're both based on Polynesian culture, though Lilo & Stitch is more specifically Hawaiian and Moana is more of Polynesia as a whole. There could be comparisons to the Pixar film that released a couple years after Moana Luca as it also has connections to the sea, but takes place in a place other than Polynesia and more in Europe like the Little Mermaid. Moana could also be compared to Disney's Pocahontas as Pocahontas is also a Disney princess who's daughter to a chief.Moana does have good songs in my opinion. Often times Disney does put good songs in their movies and this is no exception. As well, it's definitely does a good job at showing the princess (of which Moana has been officially been labeled by Disney though she argues she might not be one despite being the daughter of a Chief) doesn't always need a prince.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Autotune,"I have been a bit leery of DIsney Princess movies of late, since they seem to have fallen into rote modes. Frankly, I didn't care for Frozen at all, and was surprised when it did great business. However, I neither know nor care what most people want. I'm lucky if I know what I like after I've seen it, and I like this movie a lot. It's a real Hero's Journey, with a lot of story, and the roles of the characters keep shifting around. When I heard Maui's voice, I thought ""Is that Dwayne Johnson? And do I now know Dwayne Johnson's voice?"" When he began singing the best song of the movie I was convinced I was mistaken, but I was wrong. I was not mistaken, and apparently he can sing pleasantly.The songs are decent, although not as good as they were when Ashman was doing the lyrics, but reasonably effective.

A Mary Sue Feminist Daydream.,"This is everything wrong with modern day Disney. The humour was excellent but why has everything got to be made into a joke? Everyone and everything, including even the villian, was made into a complete joke except of course for the female hero, Moana. She's Ms. 'anything a man can do, I can do better', despite her having zero training or experience.The writers wanted to portray Maui as arrogant and narcissistic (and no doubt he was) but I think it was Moana's character who was ultimately the product of the writer's own narcissistic fantasies. Everything that happened in this movie was to glorify her. Half way through the movie they tried to make her out to be a reluctant hero but it didn't work because they already established her as a Mary Sue. She had no actual flaws, only fake ones. She was boring, with no personality, and she wasn't relatable. The only 'flaw' they gave her was that she was insecure, and that all she needed to do to unlock her full potential and become what modern Disney thinks is a hero was to simply realize how amazing she really is. The only two things standing in her way of that were, of course, both men, with her dad, the chieftain, being the tyrannical patriarchy.This movie, like so many of Disney's nowadays, is a feminist's daydream. They no longer celebrate (wrong word but I can't find the right one) femininity, masculinity, archetypes, and morals. They only push politics, post-modernism, and narcissism. It's the difference between art and propaganda. They only good things I have to say about films like this is the the good humour and the remarkable visuals.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
A strong original property to birth another Disney franchise,"Moana has enough cute, lovable characters with strong entertaining songs and gorgeous animation that even at times when I found myself bored (and there were a few) I can see where this has the ability to expand into another tent pole franchise for Disney.Voice acting was spot on which seems to be a standard with Disney these days. Actors brought real emotion to the screen and comedic beats hit perfectly. Dwayne Johnson as Maui was charismatic, charming and all around stole the show, making me wonder if there is anything this WWE Star can do poorly at all?Animation was gorgeous, seriously. The ocean was a character in this movie and makes me wonder if was and intentional choice or because the animation and water texture was so strong that the byproduct is that the ocean can't help but be turned into a character. I'm not sure how much testing goes into these Disney movies but it's clear whatever Disney is doing they are paying attention to the details and doing their homework in order to release a product that will sustain them 20-30 years from now with the nostalgia that I feel from movies like Aladdin or Beauty and the Beast of any one of many Disney films from my own youth.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A feminist remake of Hercules,"I found this idea to remake Hercules in a feminist key spectacular. I had more fun watching Hercules. And I have liked more the songs. Even the voice cast was better there. But this is finally a good departure from the breeder princess helpless in need of a man to rescue her and do adult stuff after the movie has ended.The script has holes. Not as big as I am used to see coming from what's labeled as Hollywood, but still, all the magic in the movie still can't cover them. Sure, after training with a demi-god, Moana can make a speedboat out of an wooden raft with sail. But her father wanted her away from the water. So how come she is able to sail so well a boat that is far more difficult to steer than the modern catamaran? How come she can swim so well with her father not letting her near the water. And if the ocean is so decided to keep her in the game, why do we even bother with a boat? Just to have the silly chicken keep falling off? And this one corrects the Teutonic standard of femininity so embraced by the late Walt Disney at the same time as adding some variety to the panel of existing princesses. But this is not Zootopia. The message is zero besides having a strong woman character. The gags are lower in quality and further apart. And it's simply a cross of mostly Hercules and some parts of Finding Nemo.Contact me with Questions, Comments or Suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail.ch",,Anonymous,Animation
"Disney Rarely Misses when it Comes to Animaton, Moana is no Exception","2016 while being a pretty screwed up year in a few different ways has been a solid year for animated movies. Zootopia and The Secret Life of Pets both did well and Kubo and the Two Strings is one of my favorite movies of the year. So where does Moana fit into this? I tried really hard not to compare Moana to the other terrific animated movies this year, which was really difficult to do, luckily Moana can stand up with those other movies, and in some cases exceeds them.I want to begin with reviewing the music, and while I believe music is the most subjective piece of art there is, there is no doubting that the music in Moana is fantastic. It has been a while since a Disney musical has gotten songs, that's plural, songs that got stuck in my head. The trio of Lin-Manuel Miranda, Mark Mancina and Opetaia Foa'i absolutely kill on the soundtrack with songs that really help to bolster the events taking place in the movie. If I were to pick the best part of Moana it would be the soundtrack.....or Moana is one of, if not the most impressive looking Disney movie to date. The lush setting of tropical islands really lets the animators do some incredible things, like waterfalls and trees with large green leaves. The water in Moana plays a huge role and man does it look good. There were moments where I was not sure if they had animated it or had combined the animation with real shots of the beach. The character animation is great as well, Moana herself being the best of the bunch. While I lean towards liking the animation in Kubo and the Two String a bit better there is no denying that Moana is the best looking animated movie of the year.Moanas' plot is pretty straight forward, Moana is the heir to the throne of the island that her family lives on, and even though her father believes it is best for his people to stay in the safety of their reef, Moana is drawn to adventure out into the ocean. There is also a bit of a conservation message in there too, but talking about that too much will be a bit of a spoiler. While both good themes for a children's movie, I feel that by the end of the movie, they had sort of put those to the side and falls off the moral rails a bit. While not plot shattering, I think it is important for these movies to complete their theme and give kids something to learn about when all is said and done.When I looked up the voice cast after the movie I was shocked to see that there were only 12 credited voice actors in the whole movie. Dwayne Johnson is great at so many things, and he is not a bad voice actor, he is actually a good one, but the performance of Auli'i Cravalho, both in singing and line reading is the performance that stands out in Moana. This young girl has a real talent and certainly a career ahead of her, and again to say that she out performs the Rock is no small feat.Moana is really great. There is almost no better way to say it. It's enjoyable and just the right length for a good animated movie. Sure there are some corny jokes in there and some decent sized plot holes but overall you really can't beat 2 hours of great animation and even better songs. Weather you have kids or are a big fan of animated movies, I am sure Moana will not disappoint. Worst case it may be nice to sit in a movie theater, or on the couch while it is -17 degrees outside and look at a beautifully drawn tropical paradise for a couple of hours this holiday season.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Decent but very interesting and beautiful,"As much as I enjoy Disney movies and having watched a lot of those princess films in my younger years, this is the latest of those princess ones (in which I have somewhat lost interest). It's decent for me but anyone who likes Pacific Island motifs would find it fun. Dwayne Johnson was the best part as the demigod. A lot of my friends can't stand him because he's a former wrestler but that seems like such an unfair judgment and an utterly ridiculous reason to dislike a celebrity. He's made some decent movies, so what's not to like? I enjoyed him in the Scorpion King. Anyway, back to Moana. I enjoyed the themes that went into the movie, especially the Pacific Island motifs, Moana's mission, and the clash between spirits, humans, and demigods. It's almost like Avatar: The Last Airbender that way. Oh, but to put it honestly, it's not my absolute favorite Disney film, but the visuals were stunning.

Amazing ocean!,"Palms, sand, warm ocean water, fragrant coconuts, colorful outfits, traditional dances and mythology of the peoples of Polynesia. All grown on the sheen of the scales ""Little Mermaid"" (1989), the magic of ""Aladdin"" (1992) and the legends of ""Hercules"" (1997) and all growing up on the phone call ""Frozen"" (2013) and the ""Zootopia"" (2016) Will conquer the joint creativity of the beloved creators of 2016 called ""Moana"".With the support of a whole team of anthropologists, teachers, scientists, linguists, cultural experts and navigation specialists, the Disney creative union tells an amazing story based on the culture of the Polynesian people unknown outside the Pacific. In the center of the story is Princess Moana, the daughter of a tribal leader from the fictitious island of Motunui, which embodies thousands of Polynesian islands. She is chosen by the ocean to save her world and people from the ancient spell and death. And her heroic mission is fun, successful and easy, until the culprit of all ills, the demigod Maui, interferes with her. Well, or just a two-hundred-year-old offended man.Magic and brightness, detailing and technique, concreteness and intelligibility. All the age categories are captivated by that fantasy, childish spontaneity and purity, which is hidden in the rationality of hidden images and meanings from adult directors: the dumb crab is full of shine, the nature that has become offended by consumers-people, the powerful, but infantile demigod, and the most Ordinary girl as a standard of overcoming fears and courage to swim against the current. However, not so much the iridescent childishness in the hearts of the creators makes the cartoon exciting and deep, how much an adult sense of proportion in their heads.The disobedience of parental care and the pursuit of a dream are not in conflict, but in harmony with love and respect for the feelings of their ancestors and especially the advice of a wonderful grandmother. The acquired independence, wisdom, friendship and courage accompany the basic message - the preservation of nature. Computer graphics unobtrusively replaced by futuristic drawings in the good traditions of folk art of Polynesia. And when the next song would be superfluous even for the genre of the musical (which complements comedy, adventure and fantasy), one of the characters honestly and openly says, as if reading the viewer's thoughts: ""If you start singing, I will definitely vomit!"" For the company with such subtle irony, the natural hindrance of the unruly curly hair of the heroes, the play with the water and the awkwardness of Maui are simply amusing. The abundance of musical motifs and variety of songs are amazing. And admires the non triviality of the find in the form of hand-drawn tattoos: in general and mini-Maui in particular. Being located on the heart and moving all over the body of the carrier, he, like the conscience of his possessor, discourages that from stupidity, cowardice and betrayal.Following the awards of the British Academy, Golden Globe and Oscar in 2017, Moana did not become the best animated film, giving way to the ""Zootopia"". However, for the viewer, it will definitely become a classic and synonymous with kindness, purity, courage and dreams for many years to come. Because this is the perfect cartoon of the perfect graphics, ideal characters, story, sound, music and send. The only negative, which for someone even a plus: after viewing everyone wants to make a tattoo.10 of 10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Top tier Disney that brings all the classic Disney traits along for an unforgettable journey,"Disney's 56th animated feature film comes in the shape of Moana, a film that takes the audience on an adventure across the ocean with the usual mix of beautiful animation, heartfelt narrative and catchy songs. Disney have already had a strong year with the likes of Zootopia and Finding Dory so the pressure was on for them to deliver a hat-trick for the year.Moana Waialiki (Auli'i Cravalho) is the daughter of the village chief who's tribe lives on the Polynesian island of Motunui. Having a connection with the ocean since a very young age, Moana has always been stopped by her father, Chief Tui Waialiki (Temuera Morrison), from going out beyond the reef.When she hears of the legendary demigod Maui (Dwayne Johnson) and how he holds the key to stopping Matunui from decaying, Moana sets sail across the dangerous ocean to locate Maui and have him restore the heart of Te Fiti, an island goddess, so she can restore life to Motunui.As I've already mentioned, Moana brings a lot of classic Disney traits to the table and it does it so well, putting it up there as one of the best Disney films in recent years. The animation on show in Moana is just stunning, awash with such vibrant colours, bringing the ocean and characters to life quite brilliantly.I really enjoyed the film's writing of both narrative and characters too; the story being one that resonates with real life and having to look after our planet, along with the emotional family element that really sets the story in motion. The film is very funny as well, Heihei the rooster stealing many scenes and a nod to Mad Max: Fury Road as Moana and Maui run into a group of Kakamora pirates on the ocean. Never thought I'd ever be seeing a homage to that particular film in a Disney animation.The characters are as colourful and strong as the animation, and the voice work from Dwayne Johnson and Auli'i Cravalho is top notch, both sounding as if they've fulfilled a dream of playing a character in a Disney animation. Then there are the songs of Moana, beautifully written and performed by the respective cast members, my personal favourites being You're Welcome and I Am Moana.Moana really is top tier Disney and while I think I preferred Zootopia, Moana is superior to Frozen, Disney's biggest smash-hit in the past few years.

Another Strong Contender for Best Animated Film of 2016,"Moana is a story about learning. Not Romance, not Adventure, not stopping evil people from doing evil things because they are evil. Just Learning. And that in a lot of ways is a fantastic message to put in a film aimed at children because children are always learning and often times they really don't like doing so, but Moana makes the concept of learning seem fun and important.For example Moana in the beginning of the film learns a secret of her people that gives her confidence to go forth with her plans to save her people from the main problem she faces in the story (which I will not be spoiling). But that discovery makes her eager to sail but she doesn't know how to sail, so she learns the basics on her own and later has no problem asking for help when needed to get even better at the sailing. This desire to learn and impliment that learned knowledge in the world and situations Moana finds herself in is a great message for the youth and adults in the audience.Another fantastic thing that Moana has to boast about is the voice acting that it boasts. Really there are not as many characters in this movie as there have been in other Disney movies so the voice acting that Moana does have had to be good to carry the weight of the film and boy do they. Each voice is distinct and fantastic, there is so much charisma and charm to these characters that you don't even think of them as actors in a studio somewhere.And when they sing. Oh My God!Lastly the visuals, of course they are beautiful, its a Disney flick after all. But the water is absolutely incredible, it may be something strange to say but it absolutely made my jaw drop seeing a 3D film with this kind of environment.Overall I do not think this will be the best animated movies of the year, not even the best Disney animated movie of the year, but that is not a knock to Moana its just the year that we have had. Moana is a great movie and can stand with the best of them. It's great, go watch it, everyone, everywhere, any age. It's worth it.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
It's just alright,"This film tells the story of a daughter of a Polynesian chief, who is fascinated by the ocean. However, the chief forbids anyone sail past the reefs, even when fishing is no longer possible in their island waters.There are funny moments in ""Moana"", such as the scene when her hair slaps onto her face, and the comment about her giving the sky a high five. The coconuts are funny as well, and I think the fight with coconuts is the best part of the film. The crab, however, is the worst part of the film. I can't quite stand the songs of the crab, and the glittery effect of his shell somehow just doesn't seem right.

An Animated Feast For Your Eyes,"If I could write a review solely based on Moana's animation, it would be 20-pages long, and the movie would score a 10 out of 10. I cannot emphasize how beautiful this movie is. The textures, the colors, the movement, and the design of Moana are just breathtaking. This is the type of opulent 3-D animation that makes you wonder why Disney still owns Pixar if their animation studio is pumping out quality like this. This is Technicolor for the digital age, and it is glorious.Moana follows the timeless Disney tradition of young girls finding their identity through a journey of self-discovery only to see that home is where their heart lies. One would think this trope would wear thin, but not with Disney movies. Disney's willingness to explore different cultures, their timely use of humor, and a cinematic storytelling style that is pure Disney magic, keeps things fresh and enlightening. And no, I don't work for the House of Mouse, but I'm definitely a fan. This time, Disney ventures into the Ancient Polynesian culture to tell the story of a young princess named Moana's (newcomer Auli'I Cravalho) who is desperate to save her people from a food shortage. But to do this, she must venture out beyond the barrier reef, against her father's wishes. A near death experience for Moana almost convinces her that her father is right to avoid traversing the ocean, but Moana's sage-like grandmother gives her departing words of wisdom that is all she needs to find the inspiration to carry on.Armed with no knowledge of sailing, Moana sets out to find the demigod Maui-played infectiously by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, because he is believed to be the only one who can help save their island. And Moana is a determined young woman who is willing to endure Maui's stubborn, narcissistic and borderline abusive male ego, to achieve her goals at all costs. The story follows them (and a stupid chicken) on a journey across the Pacific Ocean to return a magical pounamu stone that Maui stole from the goddess Te Fiti to give to humanity as a gift for purely selfish reasons. Moana and Maui will spend most of their time sparring before realizing they need one another to complete their mission, but it's the final climatic battle with the lava monster Te Ka that reveals the films biggest secret and showcases an epic cascade of animated artistry.Moana is a fun family film that allows The Rock to showcase that egotistical charm that won him millions and millions of fans as a pro wrestler. And Auli'l is so passionate about her performance that Moana comes off as one of the fiercest yet loveliest Disney princesses since Mulan-one of my favorite Disney films. No disrespect intended to Frozen and Princess and the Frog fans. While the songs in Moana are not as epic in scale as the renaissance era of Disney films in the 90's, the songs are still enjoyable. And Alessia Cara's theme song for the movie-""How Far Will I Go""-is the kind of self-empowerment anthem that will leave you humming the chorus long after the movie ends. While the film drags in a few sections, overall, Moana is a fantastic journey into Polynesian mythology, and it'll leave you wanting to plan a vacation to South Pacific to immerse yourself in this fantastic culture.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Moana is Magnificent,"The most recent animated film by Disney is entitled ""Moana"" about a Polynesian princess. She lives on a South Pacific Island. Don't know if it's Hawaiian or Polynesian but a major character is named Maui (played by Dwayne the Rock Johnson) as a demigod. Moana is the village chief's daughter. Her grandmother has a tattoo on her back of a stingray. She plans to return as one of them. The animation is first rate with beautiful colors especially the ocean. Moana was the chosen one to return the heart to another island. Tattoos especially on Maui are part of the picture as well. Moana is a likable girl who chooses to follow her heart to the sea and set things right in for her village. I especially liked the beginning of Moana as a young child. The grandmother does a terrific job as the crazy village lady. I enjoyed the colorful graphics and the film's story line. Unlike other Disney films, Moana doesn't have a love interest. Her relationship with Maui was friendship throughout.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Welcoming Disney Film,This is an alright enough Disney film for all viewers to watch. The cast certainly knew what they were doing when they were creating this film. The storyline of this Disney film was unique and out of the ordinary for Disney but it worked finely. The cast selection was great enough. They strongly committed to the storyline. The chemistry between the cast members could have been stronger. This Disney film reveals to viewers the true importance of culture and heritage that is in the world of today. There are issues out there in the world of today that need to end. Everyone needs to work together to make the world of today a better and safe place.

Another outstanding entry in the ever-improving Walt Disney Animation Studios,"After Zootopia in March, I was very excited for this one. It exceeded my expectations by being more than just an average ""hero's journey"" flick. The music is excellent, and the titular protagonist is very human. This movie shows how far Disney has come, and I am glad to say that they no longer stand in Pixar's shadow. I instantly fell in love with this film, and will definitely re-watch it.Although it may seem like the typical ""hero's journey"" I mentioned before, this movie is very different. It is surprising. It is inspiring and powerful. I found nothing wrong with this movie. It is a must-watch and is further proof that Disney movies are continuing to get better.First of all, the music (composed by Lin-Manuel Miranda of Hamilton fame) is incredible, consisting of sing-along songs that could easily compete with the ones in Frozen.The performances, especially by The Rock and newcomer Auli'i Cravalho are amazing, although some may not be happy with the American accents.The animation is absolutely gorgeous, beautifully detailed, and a joy to look at. The story has more depth than what I've come to expect.Although some people may note the faults with the portrayal of Polynesian culture, you can easily overlook this and appreciate Disney for recognizing it in the first place.Unless you are truly tired of Disney's formula, go out and see Moana.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
I can't complain,"Moana was a very fun movie! Compared to more recent Disney films I would score it higher than all of them (besides tangled). It was a lively and colorful experience in theaters and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.At times, the movie played out to be one-dimensional. The music didn't meet Disney standards which I think is the only reason I wouldn't score this film as a strong 8 . The main song followed throughout the movie was very good but the rest lacked. With music being such a large part of every Disney experience, I have to give this film a 7. However, I thoroughly enjoyed it and had a blast in theaters. I would recommend Moana to people of all ages!",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
In the Upper Half of Disney Classics..,"Witnessing the birth of a new Disney princess is exciting. But when it's paired with a well executed ""good Disney film formula"", you have something beautiful. Which is the fairest word I can describe this film with.It's quite unfair to review a Disney film the same way you review any other film. One must review each aspect of the formula that were binded together to create the emotional Disney experience.1- The Princess : Moana is your typical modern day Disney princess even if she doesn't look like one. She's the curious, kind and courageous girl that wants to break free and defy her parents to seek something she's been longing for.2- Music / an original catchy song : The Music in Moana was my first Lin Miranda experience. And I Loved it! . Some may disagree, but the music throughout this film was superb and in my opinion, the best aspect of it. We'll definitely be hearing ""How Far I'll Go"" everywhere in the next few months. So cover your ears if you don't want to hate it. It will probably snatch best original song from Zootopia's ""Try Everything"" as well.3- The plot/conflict : Moana, with the help of the demigod Maui, sails on a journey to return the heart of Ti-Fiti in order to stop the corruption that has spread across the ocean and destroyed nearby islands. For a Disney film plots are one of the last things you remember. Since it's all about the experience this plot is simple and does the job.4- The Prince or Male Character : When I saw a couple of Maui scenes in the trailers I thought they were a bit forced. But I'm glad I was proved wrong. His jokes no matter how cheesy they might sound work great in the film. Much of that is thanks to Dwayne Johnson's excellent performance.. Maui grows on you as a character, and has great chemistry with Moana. I could watch them conversing on a boat for hours.5- Animal Side Kick : If you know some of the basic chicken behaviors, you are in for a treat. The chicken side kick in this film has some of the funniest scenes. They were well timed and simply creative.6- The CG and Animation : If I write down every synonym for beautiful, It won't be enough to describe how gorgeous the CG and Animation was in this film. It's amazing to see how it has evolved throughout the years.7- The journey : This is undoubtedly the hardest part to execute. especially when you have a dozen of writers working together. For Moana this was executed well. Usually the parts or sequences that drag an Animated Film down reside in the third act. But for Moana, The third act was my favorite part of the film. There were a couple of sequences in the first half involving ""pirates"" and a crab monster that personally felt unnecessary . I'm sure some would enjoy them more though.Overall this film is gladly what I expected it to be. A Disney Classic. It might not be as timeless as Beauty and the Beast or Cinderella. But It surely is a great addition to the collection and a perfect Thanksgiving Cinema Experience.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wayfinding Into New Territory with A Likable Heroine and Interesting Tale,"I still can't believe my eyes in what I just saw. The visuals of Polynesian culture, tranquil vegetation, an immersive oceanic setting that's a living entity of its own, expressive songs performed magnificently by newcomer Auli'i Cravalho (I have to also credit The Rock having some singing chops too), and the character dynamics all kept my attention that it summed up yet another dazzling successor from this year's caper film Zootopia by the crew at Disney. Moana definitely has spunk and a spiritual personality mirroring that of Pocahontas crossed with a hint of Lilo Pelekai that my attention shifted quickly on where her adventure will take her next.The story of Moana is that she's a free-spirited Polynesian individual who dreams of following her own path beyond her home in the Pacific Islands ever since she can barely walk. However when her home island of Motunui is threatened by a mysterious supernatural being and given the guidance of her wise grandmother, she must venture out in the ocean waters to find the demigod Maui where they must team up to put an end to the chaos.The chemistry between Auli'i Cravalho voicing the leading heroine Moana and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson voicing demigod Maui began to somewhat remind me of the witty banter between characters of previous Disney animated films (Zootopia and Wreck-It Ralph to name a few) as well as a cross between the whimsical Genie of ""Aladdin"" and reluctant personality of Phil from ""Hercules"" on Maui's end. Not to mention his tattoos are also appealing because they seem to have a mind of their own and him spouting a couple wisecracking meta-references in some parts of the film were pretty laughable. Notably, the song ""How Far I'll Go"" is enthralling and stands out the most among the other well-written music pieces, giving a sort of ""Lion King"" chill to it. Broadway playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda (Hamilton) definitely laid his cards out on the table by unveiling a few catchy songs and the collaborations with both Jemaine Clement and South Pacific Fusion singer Opetaia Foa'i made the ambiance feel more culturally serene and enchanting at the same time.Directors John Musker and Ron Clements have certainly come a long way spanning well over three decades under Disney since I remembered their work dating back to 1986. Whether it be The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Hercules, or even Princess and the Frog, they've certainly pushed their boundaries further from their usual 2D animated flicks and wayfinding into 3D terrain with an intriguing story on how one heroine doesn't need a prince to rescue her or fall in love with (though an animal sidekick is a must). No, instead the focus is about finding the path that suits you along with the perils that lie ahead and seeing that there is good somewhere within. But hey, no one said it would be easy.Look out, awards season. This is definitely a must-see and I applaud the amazing cast and crew for weaving such a tale.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Color by numbers kids film. Borrows from many others. Good for kids.,"We saw this with our 2-year old. She enjoyed it. It's compared to Frozen and has some of the same producers. However, this film is no Frozen. While it follows a similar structure to Frozen, the ""color by numbers"" themes, songs, and production feel a bit tired. I enjoy the South Pacific theme and feel they could have made this a great film, but they have made a good film that is good for kids. This empowered character uses the ""sea"" where Frozen used ice. The main songs are soaring, but not as memorable as Frozen. The ""radio versions"" of the songs seem overly commercial. The main male character's complexity is vastly cartoonish and overplayed. He's bad, then good. Ego- maniac, then humble. Moana is a sweet and empowering character that works well, but the story around her gets increasingly absurd and zany. Sorry, this is only a good film, not a great one.",,Anonymous,Animation
Really enjoyable movie.,"As in the title, disney keeps us entertained with beautiful art and funny characters. ""The rock""/Maui it's the right successor of the late Robin Williams/Genie of the lamp.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Never trust a big crustacean's impatience,"If Frozen was Disney's (anti-traditional)wedding film - anchoring a snarky, tongue-in-cheek ill-advised pairing with family drama, dubiously scheming relations, anxiety, and outbursts of repressed ice powers (what - what was your wedding like?) - Moana is the perfect Honeymoon, and ideal palate cleanser for a generation of preschoolers who just won't Let It Go. Fittingly, amidst the tropical paradise trappings, it's also a film with classicism on the brain, recruiting veteran The Little Mermaid directors Ron Clements and Don Hall for such a grand, old-fashioned seafaring 'hero's journey' Disney film you practically expect Moana to wave to Timon and Pumba along the way. It's telling that Moana is narratively rooted in the tension between respecting tradition and individualism, as the film plays like a tapestry of the greatest hits of where Disney has gone, while leaning towards frontiers it hopes to continue to push. And if Moana, one of the most lushly emotive, visually jaw-dropping, and inventively fun releases, not just for 'Modern Disney' but 'All-Time Disney,' the House of Mouse is in no danger of losing its mojo for untold years to come.There's a comforting simplicity in Moana's three-act structure, but it's a familiar enough setup to momentarily risk getting too caught up tracking allusions to past Disney hits (Pocahontas' restless individualism in the face of tradition and environmental subtext; Hercules' moving artwork as surrogate Jiminy Cricket 'conscious', and so on) to follow the unfurling plot. Still, Clements and Hall attack it with gusto, and an almost primal resonance and depth of feeling that's a welcome callback to Ye Olde Disney Classics. If Disney has one overarching theme throughout its oeuvre, it's dissatisfaction with the status quo, and Moana (newcomer Auli'i Cravalho; luminously charismatic, and an almost eerily emotive singer)'s quarantine on her seemingly idyllic island paradise, taunted by the inaccessible sea she yearns to explore, each refrain of expositional tune Where You Are quickly becomes almost noxiously claustrophobic. Thankfully, the anthropomorphic sea and Moana's wacky- but-wise grandmother (Rachel House's creaky affectations, perfectly creased with heart) have other ideas - there's destiny afoot, and no time to waste.As such, there's an almost tangible feeling of cathartic release when she finally Lets It G-ahem-bursts out to the sea, joining up with rambunctiously boastful demigod Maui (Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, whose oaken tones impart an exquisitely larger-than-life playfulness) for a buddy-cop road trip steeped in carefully reverent Polynesian mythology. Their adventures are fun, but fairly rote and episodic, but we're still in 'Love Is An Open Door' meta-Disney mode here, and Clements and Hall are careful to pivot whenever cliché threatens to encroach. Here, the plucky, confident yet quirkily neurotic titular 'don't-call-her-a-princess' realizes the best way to honour her ancestral traditions is to seemingly rebel against them, the blowhard Maui is lent a deceptively downbeat backstory, and there's not a whiff of a romantic subplot to stifle the fun.Instead, we plunge full steam ahead into a sublimely bonkers Mad Max homage chase with a murderous band of coconut pirates, a (sadly rushed) foray into an under- underwater Land of the Monsters, headlined by treasure-encrusted-crustacean Tamatoa (the effervescently witty Jemaine Clement, having a ball camping up his David Bowie-spoofing glam rock crab - geddit?). Eventually, the plot cascades into a showdown with a gigantic lava monster, which subverts expectations by poignantly furthering Disney's recent trend in unorthodox, nonviolent climax resolution (see also: Marvel's Doctor Strange). Moana's power ballad is 'How Far I'll Go,' and Clements and Hall certainly take her at her word.Still, Moana truly reaches the realm of the greats as an almost flawlessly dazzling sensory experience. Showcasing arguable some of the most gorgeous animation ever to cross the silver screen, Moana dazzles in details grand and small, from the flecks of flame dribbling off the immense lava monster sizzling into the sea, from the breeze rustling through the coconut trees on Moana's home island, to Moana's grandmother's spirit gliding through the ocean like a spectral manta ray, only to soar into the sky, crashing into the constellations. The sentient ocean alone allows for a treasure trove of outstanding visuals - the money shot is its introduction, parting itself (take that, Moses) to create an ensconcing aquarium wall around toddler Moana, though if you've ever wondered what a wave cocking its head incredulously would look like, now you know.Matching the sumptuous visuals head on is the gorgeous music, including the movingly earthy melodies of Mark Mancina and Opetaia Foa'i, and the breathlessly nimble wordplay of Hamilton scribe Lin-Manuel Miranda, make Moana's soundtrack immediately rank among the most infectiously earwormy Disney tunes of all time. Tamatoa's setpiece alone is an unforgettable masterclass of sight and sound, as the humongous bejewelled crab turns into a bioluminescent disco ball, battering Maui while simultaneously poking at the film's 'love yourself' theme. Did I mention he rhymes 'demigod' with 'decapod' (look it up)? You don't see that in The Secret Life of Pets.It may toe the line of over-familiar for some more jaded viewers, and it's less character-driven than recent compatriots Frozen and Zootopia, but Moana is still practically bursting with abiding excellence. Visually sumptuous, musically magnificent, neatly sidestepping pitfalls of convention, and lent a uniquely wacky charisma by the superb cast, Disney continues to push the envelope for considerate and mature storytelling - kid-appropriate, but also surprisingly resonant for the parents discreetly wiping aside tears beside them. All this, and Alan Tudyk cameos through the clucks of an impossibly stupid comic relief rooster. Is it any wonder the film's catchiest tune is simply titled 'You're Welcome'?-9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

A perfection of the formula for a Disney classic.,"Disney's ""Moana"" is their first musical movie since Frozen, and so they had to show they still had potential in regards to making meaningful movies for all ages. Moana is the perfect successor to Frozen's success. Yet, originality should be the most influential factor of a Disney movie, and Moana feels solely like a ""best bits"" compilation of it's older siblings.The storytelling found in Moana is almost a perfection of the formula Disney established alongside its ""Revival era"" back in 2009 with ""The Princess and the Frog"" and later movies. So, ultimately, the movie has a warm, familiar feeling to it that makes it instantly lovable. That said, it also means originality story line-wise is rare. You're given a similar protagonist to Rapunzel from Tangled, with similar deuteragonists to Hans from Frozen or Flynn Rider from Tangled. Many of the themes found in Moana are simple copy-and- pastes of other movies.Although I've seen many concepts in other Disney movies, that does not mean I don't like them. Disney used the best ideas from its predecessors in order to establish a perfect story line. You can really feel themes from movies like Mulan, The Little Mermaid, Pocahontas, Hercules, Frozen, Brother Bear and definitely Tangled appearing in Moana. I'm not expecting Disney to whip up a new 100%-successful formula for each Disney movie it creates. That wouldn't work. The only way art can progress is by building on what went right previously. It's like the natural selection of storytelling.On another note, the voice work in Moana is stunning. Bringing in such powerful (and arguably unqualified) voice actors was definitely a risk for Disney, and they knew that. Auli'i Cravalho has such a magnificent voice in regards to emotion in both speech and singing. Even at only 14 years old, she was an admirable and talented person. Dwayne Johnson was a surprise for me, as I truly didn't expect him to be as good as he was. I knew he could act, but to portray such emotion through his voice AND sing magnificently was the biggest plot twist.Speaking of singing, the soundtrack to Moana is beautiful in every way. Everyone expected a lot when they found out the writer of the songs behind the hit musical ""Hamilton"" was behind the soundtrack for the movie, and Moana does Miranda true justice. I went in blind by intentionally not listening to the soundtrack before watching, and I was so glad I chose to do that. Songs like ""How far I'll go"", ""We know the way"" and ""You're Welcome"" are amazing to listening to in true immersion for the first time. You get to appreciate them as storytelling devices before you get to hear them as well-written songs, and they are successful in both fields.The animation in Moana is simply beautiful. The hair on all characters really bounces and falls so satisfyingly, the sky and sea always maintain their beauty, and the movie's shots are all so artistic in both aesthetic and angle. The characters and scenes are rendered so well and look genuinely pleasing to the eye. Although, backgrounds and scenery arguably don't look as stunning as those in Pixar's ""The Good Dinosaur"" but this movie suits the more cartoon-y feel that it maintains.The characters in Moana are authentic in personality, such as their intentionally self-obsession or humbleness. They progress and develop to attach emotions for one another that you definitely respect as an audience. That said, many characters do not live up to their potential. Heihei the chicken contributes almost nothing to the story line of Moana other than to create a cheap laugh from the young children that may be bored. I feel like this was also done in movies like Brother Bear or Cinderella. One thing Frozen did so well was that its comic relief sidekick actually contributed to the plot by allowing the protagonist to learn something new that could help along the journey. Heihei doesn't do that. Moana's pig, Pua, starts off almost like a sidekick to Moana in the first 20 minutes, yet does not appear in the movie until the final 5 minutes. Pua had potential and could've been a friend to Moana on her journey like Pascal was to Rapunzel, or like Mushu and the Flea were to Mulan.Overall, Moana was definitely an amazing Disney classic, as it took what other movies did so well and squashed it into a new, fantastic movie. With stunning visuals, lovable characters, and catchy songs, Moana stands with the greats like Tangled, Aladdin, and Mulan.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Another heartwarming film from Walt Disney Animation Studios.,"Moana is a movie set in Polynesia. Moana(Auli'i Cravalho) is the daughter of an island chieftain. A dastardly curse caused by demigod Maui(Dwayne Johnson), affects Moana's island. Now, it is up to Moana to find Maui & make sure that he corrects his mistake, before it's too late.Moana is a brilliant movie. The animation is gorgeous & all the locales in the film, look very life-like. The 3D gets you more involved in the proceedings on screen. All the songs in the movie are melodious & foot-tapping. This film is more funny than Zootopia(2016), which is the other movie released by Walt Disney Animation Studios, this year. Zootopia(2016) is more unique. However, this film has more heart & humor. The voice-over work by the cast is phenomenal. Auli'i Cravalho is outstanding as Moana. Cravalho gets across a number of emotions with her voice & sings, flawlessly. Dwayne Johnson is spectacular as Maui. The witty banter exchanged between Auli'i Cravalho's character & Dwayne Johnson's character is the highlight of the film. Rachel House is great as Gramma Tala. Temuera Morrison is awesome as Chief Tui. Jemaine Clement is impressive as Tamatoa. Nicole Scherzinger is good as Sina. Alan Tudyk is hysterical as Heihei.

An average Animation,"In a world where a demi-god has stolen the heart of a goddess in an attempt to make good deeds but has triggered a huge wave of death, Moana, the daughter of the chieftain of her kind, dreams of becoming an explorer, instead of taking her father's place. Thus, when she finds out an important information about her people's past, she decides to run away into the ocean with her animal companions.Although it looks simply stunning as many animations from the last years, it fails to impress in almost every other way. The plot is mediocre, linear and predictable, the characters are poorly described and thought, tending to become even annoying from time to time, while the action is also disappointing, in a way in which almost nothing interesting happens. They attempted to make it a comedy so the movie is filled with jokes, sarcasm and humor, but all in all, it doesn't manage to actually make you laugh. It's almost like they tried too hard, but what they've actually done is to ruin the severity of the intrigue and focus on other least important factors. The one thing that is really funny is her retarded chicken companion. To point the upsides, it has flawless animation, some good singing and a bit of suspense now and then. They make it an average movie overall, missing a good opportunity to create something unique or at least something that will make you laugh like never before.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

What Can I say Except It's OK,"Yes, this movie hits all the familiar tropes of a modern Disney Princess adventure film. But it occurred to me, that this is going to be some kids first time seeing these tired story tropes. For those kids, this is going to feel fresh, original and novel. For all those kids where this is their first animated movie, I can say it is a pretty good one.I feel the music of this film does not get the respect it deserves. The voice of Moana, Auli'i Cravalho, can sing like an absolute angel. The songs were written by the man the myth the legend, Lin-Manuel Miranda. It may have lost the Oscar, but it did win a Grammy. The animation is also nice, it appears to fit in well with the ""Tangled"", ""Frozen"" world, but it is still nice-looking animation. The titular character of Moana is what really helps this film stand out. Yes, she does have a lot of the typical Disney princess tropes, but she also has a lot of charm and likability. She is flawed, she grows and progresses through the story. She may not be the strongest, but she keeps on working at it. Her and Maui (Dwayne Johnson), work well off each other and make for a good duo.The downside is that the movie doesn't bring much new to the table story wise. We have all the same tired Disney clichés that I have grown sick of. There's the short-sighted angry father that doesn't want Moana to leave the island. He is basically the villain of the story. For a supposed family company, the parents sure are villainized or killed a lot in their stories. I won't go into spoilers about exactly how predictable the movie is, but suffice it to say, there is a third act break up, an all is lost moment and a memory that helps give our hero the confidence they need to try again. These aren't the worst plot points to have, I've just seen enough movies that I am wanting to see something new.If I were on a desert island with nothing else to watch, this wouldn't be a bad way to fill 107 minutes.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Fantastic Disney Princess Movie,"So--full disclosure: ""Moana"" is one of the few Disney ""princess"" movies that I've actually seen. That being the case, I really don't have a lot to compare this movie to, at least in terms of how she stacks up to other Disney-produced female leads. What I can say, though, is that as someone who is a fan of movies in general, this was a fantastic movie!One thing you can expect from this movie is that it follows a tried and true formula of the heroine going on an adventure, having to defeat an evil antagonist, and there being lots of kid-friendly singing along the way. The movie nevertheless takes on this task in a way that feels fresh and welcoming, by telling the story of an island girl whose tale incorporates her tribe's ancient mythology into the adventure.All in all I'm giving this movie 9/10 stars. It's fantastic, but just a tad bit shy of a perfect rating. Perhaps a bit less song and dance would have made it a perfect 10 for me.

Musical is like Britney Spears gone Emo,"Good animation, Good theme, Good characters. Music was low effort from Disney, Enrique Iglesias and Britney Spears gone Emo, backed by swashbuckling orchestral sounds with the merest hint of melody, rhythm, chords, humor, singalong potential, and calm. The songs accompany visuals of huge grimacing faces, spiraling - roller coaster camera movements, which only a kid raised up on stroboscopic cartoons can watch contentedly (in a state of zapped stupor), and Soothing like an air raid siren of emotional turmoil/crisis, which is about 2 notes off key all the time. No dance routines, No choreography, No group chorus at all, no chords, no grooves, no fun rhythms. None of the songs was actually a song, because there were no instrumental partitions. The vocalists were good but they were expected to do only one style of music, with no room for musical instruments and accompaniment.Family music is simple to write, popular and fun to listen to. Great musicals have good theme tunes.Its a shame to apply so much low quality score to such an awesome animation. Little mermaid songs were much better, more consonant, less shouted and confused. Snow White would sing in a motherly tone: maternal and paternal songs. These are commercial emo-trash songs which would rattle little ear drums without nourishing with proper emotional/educational value. The children wont go home infused with musical ire. They will be rattled, emotional, emboldened and discordant.One or two songs were 6/10.most were 2/10.Worth 10/10, with 2/10 for the low composer values.

And this weekend the animation studios are at it again with another masterpiece sure to be nominated for best animated picture of the year. The name of the movie this time is Moana, a tale of Polynesian mythology wrapped up in a nice, Disney magical package. Will this movie net Disney the best picture of the year award, or is it just another filler until Pixar's next work? Robbie K happy to bring you another review this holiday season. Let's get started.LIKES:  Fun, new setting  Comedy  Soundtrack was kickingWe all know Disney makes fun films, but Moana's fun comes in form of the beautiful settings of the Pacific. Stepping away from the castles, this film will enchant you as you set sail on the majestic oceans and the mythical creatures that inhabit them. The world is colorful and dynamically shaded to match the tones of the film, which give the film a little energy to spice things up. No surprise, the animation is fluid (as always) as realistic movements (both living and nonliving) are captured in this breathtaking CGI. While I didn't see it in 3-D, this film's design would have popped out more with the special effects, therefore earning a recommendation to give it a try if you wish. But a Disney movie isn't just about the scenery, oh no you have to have characters that make you laugh and you can latch onto. Moana continues this trend, with the lead character (Moana) being the ever inspiring, girl power rocking, role model that most leads are. In terms of laughs though, Maui has you covered on this field. Dwayne Johnson delivers in the film, his bold, brash, and loud delivery matching the charisma of the demi-god. The hero has plenty of silly qualities to him, clever one-liners, slapstick antics, and a dancing tattoo which kept me laughing through most of the film. Throw in an idiotic chicken and anthropomorphic ocean and the you get a unique team for tickling your funny bone. My favorite aspect of this movie though has to be the soundtrack. This movie finally took a step back into the Disney renaissance world. A fantastic orchestra work sets the stage for adventure, bold brass instruments blaring and drums pounding as the boat coasts out into the wild. Other scenes have a more elegant touch to them to match the touching moments, rounding out the emotion of the film in a complete package. But many will fall in love with the original music our cast composes, bringing the upbeat, inspirational tone that will have young and young at heart hitting repeat over and over again. The soundtrack was perfect for this movie, and yours truly loved the islander twist to spice the tunes up.DISLIKES:  Not as exciting as other adventures  Unnecessary scenes  Missed potentialWhile Moana was fun and beautiful, it wasn't the most thrilling tale to grace the library. The film lacked suspense for me, never finding myself at the edge of my seat fearing for our heroes. Perhaps it was the obvious foreshadowing, or the fact that very little of the threats seemed deadly, but more cuddly and silly. Plus, the character development was a little lacking at times, so there didn't seem the looming threat of Disney killing a favorite character. Without the excitement, the adventure did grow a bit dull in terms of thrills, but fortunately the fun and animation make up for it. An even stronger dislike was how unnecessary some of the scenes were in the film for me. A few of the moments, were impromptu sequences meant to instill a sense of urgency, an effort I appreciate. However, the urgency had already been established and these scenes added little to the overall emotion or plot of the story. Unfortunately, the biggest sting was entering one ""supposedly"" dangerous island that Maui builds up. It had such build up and potential, and then they dropped it. This island could have been a very unique and dangerous world that added some edge and diversity to the film in regards to bizarre flora and fauna. Yet, they quickly skimmed over this part to get to an obnoxious character (the conflict with him rather lackluster), which left me a tad disappointed. Sadly, no other creatures or beasts appeared from the depths to enhance the adventure, nor any major challenges to gradually enhance the skills of our heroes. The bottom line of this dislike, is that the editing was slightly off track for this reviewer and could have been expanded upon to add more depth and excitement to the film.The VERDICTMoana is another fine example of how awesome Disney is at animation. Beautiful visuals bring alive a unique world that will make you crave to be on the majestic waters of the pacific islands. In addition, it's a very fun movie that contains both laughs and music to instill the positive energy that Disney films love to do around the holidays. Despite all of this though, it wasn't the most exciting adventure for me and I really would have liked to see more of the mythology brought into the tale to further develop our lovable characters (and more of the cute pig too). Still, this film is worth visiting in the theaters for all ages and will spread some early holiday joy over you and those you love.My scores:Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 8.5 Movie Overall: 7.5",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A vibrant journey across the seas,"""Moana"" is a visually stunning Disney film that takes viewers on an adventurous journey through the Pacific Islands. The story follows Moana, a spirited and determined young woman, who sets sail on a daring mission to save her island from a devastating curse.The animation in ""Moana"" is breathtaking, with vibrant ocean scenes and lush island landscapes that bring the story to life. The film's music, featuring songs by Lin-Manuel Miranda, Opetaia Foa'i, and Mark Mancina, is both catchy and moving, with ""How Far I'll Go"" becoming an instant classic.Moana's character is refreshingly independent and courageous, embodying a modern Disney heroine who relies on her wit and determination rather than waiting for a prince to rescue her. Her journey of self-discovery and bravery is inspiring and relatable.Dwayne Johnson's portrayal of Maui, the demigod, adds a layer of humor and charisma to the film. Their dynamic relationship evolves throughout the movie, providing both comedic and heartfelt moments.Overall, ""Moana"" is a delightful and empowering film that emphasizes the importance of self-belief and understanding one's true potential. It's an engaging story for viewers of all ages, blending adventure, music, and a strong message of self-discovery.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

A link between worlds,"I confess to being predisposed toward Disney's latest animated feature thanks to my adoration for The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker. Like that classic video game adventure, Moana is all about the epic wonder of the rolling ocean, and the primal and mystical forces that flow between its precious islands. There are also hints of Hayao Miyazaki – especially Nausicaa and Princess Mononoke – in its strong heroine and its concerns with humanity's impact on the environment.Moana (Auli'i Cravalho) is being groomed to become chief of her Polynesian paradise of Motunui. Yet Moana is drawn to the sea and what lies beyond the horizon. In an elegant prologue, we see an infant Moana protecting a turtle as it waddles toward the ocean. Suddenly the water itself comes alive like Aladdin's carpet (this film is also directed by Ron Clements and John Musker). So we know straight away that Moana has a special understanding with the ocean, as well as an innate empathy with nature.Less so, Maui (Dwayne Johnson). He's a demigod who stole the heart of Te Fiti, the goddess who created all life. Now a corruption is creeping through the islands. Moana's dad believes that she has a duty to stay and protect her people. But Moana's grandmother feels for her wanderlust, and encourages her to follow her instinct – an instinct which tells her to set sail and find Maui, bring him to Te Fiti, and return the goddess's heart. Obviously this is the choice Moana makes, and her adventure takes her far beyond the safe coral of her homeland.Moana begins as a leader (not a princess, she insists), with her parents pulling her away from her calling. It's the classic duty versus individuality conflict, mostly rendered without black and white moralising. ""Find happiness where you are"" is the repeated mantra of the islanders – but the story's ultimate message is that such domestic happiness can only be maintained by respectfully communicating with foreign lands. (If only, humanity, if only.)Technically speaking, Moana gives us a new level of detail in CG animation. Not just in the texture rendering but in the nuance of the animation itself. The living sea – snaking like the probe in James Cameron's The Abyss – is full of wordless charisma. The general art style is nicely aligned with classic Disney 2D, except the extra dimension feels necessary to embellish the breadth of the setting.The pacing is near-perfect. By now, Disney Animation Studios probably have an algorithm for the ideal narrative structure. But heck – if they do, it's working. From the myth-building first act and the character interplay of the second; from the moment of self-doubt to the final (very touching) showdown: it's pleasingly predictable and entirely satisfying.That structural predictability allows for some fantastically bizarre setpieces along the way. Personal favourites are the attack of the Kakamora, where the movie suddenly turns into Fury Road for kids; and the Realm of Monsters, which movingly updates the weird 80s fantasy environments of films like The Legend of Sirius, and then throws in a giant glam-shelled Jermaine Clement to do a David Bowie impression.The interplay between Moana and Maui, which constitutes the drama and humour of the middle section, is smartly written and full of sparks. Being a demigod, Maui is a raging narcissist, so Moana quickly realises that persuading him to do the right thing requires an appeal to his ego – an ego which bellows godliness while whispering a fundamental vulnerability.Moana herself has the goofy appeal of the modern Disney heroine. Going deeper, her internal conflict isn't original but nor does it feel forced. Johnson and newcomer Cravalho deliver excellent voice work, some of which requires belting out lung-busting songs. Moana's theme may not be Disney's catchiest number but it sure is stirring.Joining the adventurers is a doolally rooster named Heihei. He's the slapstick cartoon element, narratively pointless but occasionally amusing. Perhaps he was inserted for younger children, because the rest of the humour is more subtle. I particularly enjoyed Maui's bromance with his living tattoo, acting as a kind of pectoral-based conscience beside his heart.Moana is up there with the best of this Golden Age of American Animation, which shows no sign of dwindling. It is extraordinarily well made and efficient, big-hearted, and achingly beautiful. Familiar elements abound, but they're remixed into an original setting with a rich mythology. Combined with thoughtful characterisation and a highly laudable (and, depressingly, an endlessly relevant) message, Moana will be seen and savoured for years to come.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Seesaw of Dissimilar Components,"""Moana"" is the 56th Disney animated feature film after ""Zootopia"", at the beginning of the year. Directed with atticism, harmony and deep deferences by the Polynesian culture by seasoned pair-director John Musker and Ron Clements (""The Little Mermaid,"" ""Aladdin"", ""The Princess And The Frog""), the newest treasure of the factory follows Moana (Auli'i Cravalho), a brave young falling in love with wonders in the ocean. She lives accompanied by her sensitive mother Sina (Nicole Scherzinger), her over-protective father Tui (Temuera Morrison) and her former navigator tribe in the radiant island of Motunui—located in the most westerly place in Chile, in life real,— they have lodged there once a nautical misfortune caused absolute cease of their trips on the sea. However, Mother Nature seems to annihilate crops and imposing beauties in which they live, by which, Moana is driven to set sail in search of Maui (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson)—the demigod who stole the precious stone from the heart of nature,— for giving back the beautiful gem to its home, causing the growth of needy groceries and nature. As is recurrent in the films of the study, Clements and Musker's road movie/ buddy movie will place the duo protagonist in more than one risky and brilliant adventure, forging naturally a spontaneous and classic friendship. What most stands out here is that we don't have a ""Princess"" itself— even so she proceed from powerful parents,— we don't have a woman of small waist, albino skin, silky hair, there is also no stepmothers or perfidious witches, there are no enchanted castles; however, the best is there's no love interest, quite the contrary, we have an essential story of female emancipation, maturity, and fellowship.Like the best Disney movies, ""Moana"" is electrifying in its traditionalism. From the first moment to the last, the film is a profusion of vividness, verism, and buoyant pictures, reaching optic magnetism that got ""Finding Nemo"" and ""The Good Dinosaur"". The textures, looks, styles, volumes and dimensions of each well- prepared features are the real links allowing to bring the story with raging incentive from adult or child audience. Ocean's life—the water is one of the characters more complicated of conceiving in computer- animated fantasy films,—marine flora and fauna—although they are not too visible, What we watched is impressive,— greenish environment of the island, the crafted visuals to Polynesian culture, Moana's curls, Maui's tattoos, everything, everything absolutely has a beautiful extravagance visual. If it were for its realistic images, this would be an instant masterpiece.The Achilles' heel comes from its screenplay written by the vast crew members (8 screenwriters). Because, the story has been related incessantly in previous animated projects; this time, it is the same essence merged into radiant pictures and even though she is the most distant in princess movies, it does not save to feel repetitive. Throughout the feature film, the effort—and the lassitude—is remarkable since they wished to have original and entertaining situations, such as the descent into the monsters world, nevertheless, trivialities of the genre are palpable. Rather than palpable are its grueling references—no, we are not talking about the 'easter eggs', and by the way, I only caught one: Sven from ""Frozen"",—the selfsame directors confessed using even some of the material from their prior works. References from the apocalyptic ""Mad Max"" by George Miller to the vibrant ""Mulan"" by Tony Bancroft and Barry Cook. Unfortunately, these reminiscences do not bring nostalgia to our minds, they bring certain cynicism when trying to confuse us.This is the best original motion picture soundtrack of Disney in years. Which is led by American actor, playwright, composer, rapper, and writer Lin-Manuel Miranda, who has monopolized lately the public points of attraction starring and creating in the Broadway musicals ""In the Heights"" and ""Hamilton""—especially by this last one. Although, many English-speaking viewers attended to movie theaters for seeing ""Moana"" for two reasons primarily—leaving most important aspects aside—: the first one, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, who lends his voice to Maui and the second one, by acclaimed Miranda's compositions, and although some of the star songs are of his authorship (""How Far I'll Go"", ""You're Welcome""), Opetaia Foa'i collaborated writing ""We Know The Way"" and Mark Mancina composed part of pleasant soundtrack (""Te Fiti Restored"", ""If I Were the Ocean""). It would not be a surprise to see coming nominations at full speed for such great achievement, simply beautiful.""Moana"" from Disney is a delightful journey to open ocean, it is inquisitively a rigorous work. Our aural and optical receivers will experience an unimaginable wonders feast, nonetheless, its narrative and treatment are not at the same level than artistic area. There is no doubt that kids and adult going to enjoy the adventures of the new and less conventional Disney princess, and although the factory is trying to break slowly modern community's unshakable taboos, there's still a long way to go. Disney, thanks for providing pure films, however, they can always be improved further, and they have extravagant opportunities here.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Surprising,"My daughter really wanted to see this, I wasn't that keen. But OK, let's do it. Got to say I was pleasantly surprised and again, I was pleased that 'princess' Moana didn't define herself through another's eyes. I'm not sure how many more independent feisty princesses Disney can release, but it's not tired yet.The characters are lovable, funny and cute. The message is simple and the story is easy to follow. Visually it's beautiful, and the songs were brilliant and catchy.Plus, how can you not enjoy The Rock doing a solo-song?I'd watch it again, I enjoyed it!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A beautiful and fun delight but not a masterpiece by any means,"Disney's Moana is a fun treat its with breathtaking animation, funny and interesting characters, and classic Disney-style musical sequences, but suffers due to a somewhat cookie-cutter story and a seemingly lack of overall stakes or consequence. All in all, Moana is another fun adventure from Disney studios that will entertain audiences of any age or background, but is far from the classics of old.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Disney production for better and worse,"No real surprises, Moana is a Disney production. You don't get any real surprises on a Disney production. Even throughout the last decade, that is from Enchanted onward, the age of the twist at the end of the story, even then, no real surprise, once we got the idea of the twist configured into the general scheme of things. But we do get loads of professionally made fun. That's why we keep on going to the cinema again and again.We get well written characters, performed superbly. We get a character for anyone on screen, even for those getting split seconds of screen time, (that's something that Pixar learned well). We also get national myth twisted into Hollywood pattern. I don't know the Polynezian myths but that's the Disney way, that's the way it worked with the Greek myths, with the Chinese, the Jewish, or the Arabian nights stories. In fact, it also happened with literary masterpieces such as Mary Poppins or Peter Pan. That's the way it'll work in future productions too, it takes no power of prophecy to say so, that's simply evident. And as long as it's fun, I'll always be willing to join the ride.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
About what you'd expect from Disney,"I appreciated the female power aspect and Polynesian representation that the movie offered, but some particular plot developments (namely the Kakamora, which I felt were trying to bank on the Minions' success) and character decisions (Maui choosing to fight against the Kakamora to save the heart, even though he was deathly afraid of it about two minutes prior) pretty much ruined the movie for me. The animation was impressive, and the voice acting and music were good as well, but the story and characters didn't do much for me.Art: 10 Story: 5 Sound: 9 Characters: 5 Enjoyment: 4Overall: 6",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Girl finds out the true identity of her people.,"Okay, I shocked when I heard this film did not get the Oscars nod, except for a song. Now I have seen the film and I come to know why. This is a one liner, but developed into a longer version Except the initial parts, this film is like a limited cast/character film. Most of the film takes place in the sea sailing around fighting evil force to break the curse. But at the end, you would feel this kind of story is not worth for a feature film. It looks a perfect short animation theme.Disney never disappoints its fans, well, for me. So I enjoyed it, it was fun and entertaining, but too simple. The characters were cute, this is a wonderful film for kids and some grownups would too enjoy it. But this is not for all, unlike most of the Disney animations are. Dwayne's voice lending for one of the lead characters was good, but the girl steals the show. Especially if you are a kid and/or a girl.The best film since 'Lilo & Stitch' on the similar theme about Pacific islands' people. But it reminded me 'Whale Rider'. Overall, I think the story should have been improved a bit, in particular by including a few more characters at least for the partial appearances. This is not the best animation of the year, also definitely the bad one to skip. If your purpose of the watch is entertainment/timepass, it is good at that.6½/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Its a good movie.,"I saw this movie in theaters and you know what, I thought it was pretty good. This movie is entertaining. Its not fantastic, but its fun.Animation - The animation is absolutely fantastic.This is probably the best thing about it.Characters - They're interesting I guess.Plot - Its nice, but pretty formulaic if you really think about it.Music - Some of the songs were good.

Moana,"This is quite a fun meander into the richness of Polynesian myth that allows the animators and the storytellers to fill their boots. The young ""Moana"" is daughter of the King, and he is terrified that an ancient curse will visit their paradise homeland should anyone venture beyond the protective reef that surrounds their island. Thing is, though, that it looks like the curse is coming anyway. Their coconuts start to rot, their supply of fish dries up - they face starvation unless someone heads out... Meantime, the young girl is sent a very clear signal by the ocean itself - and she is certain that she must leave her home and break the scourge once and for ever. Her first challenge is to catch up with the mischievous demigod ""Maui"" - who started the whole problem thing in the first place. Only together might they stand a chance of restoring the balance of nature and calming the wrath of the gods. Loads of escapades ensue - everyone gets wet (frequently), there are plenty of acrobatics as they try to evade some pirates and a rock throwing monster all whilst occasionally belting out some songs from the pen of Lin-Manuel Miranda (et al) that are very much focussed on local traditions and beliefs. The writing is quickly paced and often quite amusing - there is even the odd hint of sarcasm, and the animation is colourful and vibrant. It's a simple story with precious little jeopardy, but so what - it's an enjoyable watch for children of all ages!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
I REALLY LIKE IT,"In the end, it is Disney, the cartoon is still keen on Disney, the scene is shocking, humorous, animated and realistic, very emotional when lyrical, and the audience laughs when it is funny and funny, quite enjoyable!

Easy to enjoy with a 1h47m smile!,"Well written story, but nothing out of the ordinary. The only addition I would have liked is something in the storyline that we have never seen before.

Too perfect to be perfect,"This is of course really a lovely, enjoyable cartoon. And basically a fairy tale. One that moms and dads can feel happy to take their children too. Let it be that. There's a lot of remarkable stuff about it. The songs... the views... the sun... the water... everything as perfect as in the countless other Disney movies.Having said that, some people on these reviews are taking this way too seriously. Why would you give it one star just because other people liked it enough to give it a 10? Is that too show how much smarter you are than everyone else? It really shows nothing but taking a carton movie too seriously instead of just going with the flow. It's not real. It's not a real story. It's a cartoon fairy tale. Hence an 8.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beautiful animation with rich characters,"Moana and Maui are strong characters. Moana is proud of her tribe's heritage and won't let anyone stand in her way. Maui is very similar to his voice actor's alto ego (The Rock), he's big and arrogant, but very likable. He also has nice tattoos. Together they complement each other perfectly and were a joy to watch. The soundtrack is great. They were really catchy, and hummable. My favourite character however wasn't one of the two leads but Heihei the chicken. Heihei is a chicken from the island that snuck onto the boat when Moana went on her adventure. This chicken was hilarious. Whether it was continually banging his head off a rock like a confused Woody Woodpecker or, on more than one occasion, walking off the edge of the boat into the sea. Overall, Moana is well developed film, it's funny, had great characters and a fantastic soundtrack.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Too Mainstream to Be Memorable,"Apparently, a lot of effort HAS gone into this animation of Polynesian folklore and it has all the elements kids these days have come to expect from Disney movies: 3D animation, wide-eyed characters bumbling around or talking like hip kids are 'supposed' to talk, the hero and his/her pet, and an adventure that makes use of the aforementioned 3D animation because its clear the character design isn't! So what's wrong with it?Well, nothing you can put your finger on right away. I've enjoyed old Disney flicks and recent ones equally - Inside Out being one of the most recent that I've liked, and I've got to say, this movie was a bit boring. That's surprising considering how the characters all seem to run about and pull faces, but then again that's the DUMB way to captivate your audience. The smart way is to establish an atmosphere that gives the story it's own identity, and this movie doesn't do that.The first few minutes with Moana growing up in the village reminded me of Pocahontas, and I couldn't help but feel how everything in THAT particular movie roped me in to the world the story was trying to create, and did so very well. The music, the sound effects, the art, the way the characters spoke, everything BREATHED life into the story of the Native Americans, gave the story identity, and made it incredibly, incredibly enticing. I've heard Disney's been trying to diversify its repertoire of animated films, but with Moana, it hasn't succeeded. There was no real charm or identity breathed into the Polynesian characters. Our heroine's dialogue and delivery matches that of a teenager in 2016, not of the era she's supposed to live in.With Moana, Disney is just going through the motions to try to sell something colorful and ""diverse"", and looking at general reception, it has succeeded. I however, am not convinced.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
This has got to be the closest thing to a perfect movie,"A great story filled with great moment and emotions.
Perfect interactions and developments, and more importantly, a meaningful ending.The way the great songs heighten everything up smoothly elevates it beyond a normal story.

It's like a dream come true.It's not everyday you find something so special that makes one feel glad to be alive. A movie to which I wouldn't change a thing.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Lin Manuel Miranda,"Is a genius. Hate throwing that word around. The only other one I can think of in Hollywood is Vince Gilligan. The music is what stands out here but the movie offers much more. First off GIRL POWER. 2nd the animation is stunning. The water alone in the movie could stand up against anything from the studios of Pixar. Yes I know Disney and Pixar are one now but Moana is not a Pixar movie. Story isn't anything ground breaking but it's fine enough. Love the mad maxish scene, and off course the Bowie like turtle. Can go on but no need, just a really fun film with amazing music!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Cultural Experience,"Despite the tedious amount of singing throughout the film, Moana (2016) revealed to an audience of a widely unknown culture through an animated story. Maui, voiced my Dwayne Johnson shows an alteration for the persona of his character as well as impacting the very story in which he plays one of the main protagonists. Moana (Auli'i Cravalho) however opens the audience to a realm of hope, duty, and resilience in which has great application to her character within this culturally defined film.

Good but not Disney's best,"As I walked out of the theatre after watching Moana I overheard a kid say and echo my exact feelings, ""that was goodI liked it but I don't think I want to watch it again."" Moana is a good movie; it's well acted/voiced, has a free thinking lead, and enough quirky side characters to keep you entertained but it didn't have the touch of brilliance I've come to expect from Disney. Maybe Zootopia has set the bar too high this year. I grew up watching Disney movies which were all essentially love stories and the princess needed some sort of saving (although highly impressive even Mulan brought a prince charming home at the end). So, even though she's not technically a princess, Moana is refreshingly independent. There's no prince on the horizon and she does the saving here. But is that enough reason to love the movie? Maybe. Depends on who you ask.Moana tells the tale of a young Moana who yearns to travel the seas but is held back by her father, the chief of the island they call home. She is groomed to become the leader of her people but is warned never to leave the island for the demigod Maui has incurred a centuries old curse which wrecks havoc on the seas. But the far too curious Moana must know what's out in the world and goes searching for Maui to set things right. It's a pleasant enough story but not one we haven't seen before. Curses and setting things right with the world aren't new themes and have been explored countless times before in Disney films. The movie still does a good job establishing a credible and very likable lead. Moana isn't afraid to go against the grain. She's brave and quite stubborn. And insists on saving the world, or her island, but it's the same thing. Had it been the world, I'm sure she would've managed as well.Dwane Johnson plays Maui, the arrogant demigod, who has caused all the trouble and he is an absolute riot. I had no idea Mr. Johnson was so good at voice acting. He's effortless and hilarious. Newcomer Auli'i Carvalho, playing Moana, does a fantastic job as well. Maui and Moana have an easy chemistry which makes the movie very watchable. In fact it's their dedication to the characters and the scenes between them that are the highlights of the film. Even when you know what's to come you're eager to see them achieve it. I wasn't so much interested in the story as I was in their odd relationship.The music, an inherent part of all Disney films, was the biggest disappointment. There are a lot of songs infused in the narrative but not one comes to mind after the movie is over. That's naturally a letdown since we expect to hum, get utterly sick of, and then hum again popular Disney tunes. Let's just say there's no 'Let it Go' to get addicted to in this movie.Overall I liked the movie but I didn't love it. It has a nice message and I was glad to see a female character who wasn't a damsel in distress but I expect more. Merida from 'Brave' and Elsa from 'Frozen' have already shown us you don't need to focus on the princess' love life to make a movie work so let's do more next time, Disney. Chop chop.https://stuffiwatchblog.wordpress.com",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Worthy Addition to the Disney Lineup.,"Disney animation has an impressive repertoire of an array of films, but they're perhaps known above all for their princesses. Despite being perhaps Disney Animation's claim to fame, they've definitely slowed down on them in recent years. However, in 2016 there was another addition to the extensive Disney princess lineup, Moana. It's set in the South Pacific, with a Polynesian princess and accompanying aesthetic. Additionally, it's also a musical, another thing that gave Disney great fame and a lot of money, but has largely slowed down this century.As one would expect, Disney does a spectacular job at animating Polynesia and all the environments in this movie. The ocean looks incredible, and the amount of detail put into the water is outstanding, especially because the ocean is almost a character of its own in this movie. The other places, like the islands and any of the mystical places, also look great. Disney is known for having some of the highest quality animation in the world, and it shows here. The songs are also pretty good. The one people know most is You're Welcome, but honestly, most of that is probably from memes. How Far I'll Go is pretty good, and Shiny makes for a good villain song.Moana herself is a likable protagonist, although a bit much in the vein of some other recent characters, notably Merida from Brave. She's strong-willed and determined, which does make the audience want to root for her. Her backstory, in which she's the daughter of the chief who doesn't want her to go out on this quest, but she does so anyway. Maui, played by the Rock himself, is also a good character. The most memorable thing about him is probably his action sequences with his hook. Te Ka, who is silent, is the film's main villain, so it's nice that a Disney movie in the 2010s doesn't have a twist villain.Moana, all in all, is a worthy addition to Disney's extensive lineup. It wasn't quite the phenomenon that Frozen was, but I have a feeling that 2010s kids will remember this the same way Aladdin is remembered by 90s kids. So is there going to be a live-action Moana released in 2043?",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Excellent soundtrack and visually pleasing,"I once heard that water and hair are the two most difficult and costly things to animate. If that is true, then Moana must have been an absolute chore for the team. Thankfully, their work was realized with beautiful animation that serves to accentuate Lin-Manuel Miranda's soundtrack. Moana is a great watch for kids and adults alike.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Pretty fun Disney Movie - Suitable for kids, passable for adults","I feel like it's kinda inappropriate for me to be rating Disney movies as a 23 year old haha, but these movies are meant to have a bit of something for everyone.Anyway, as far as Disney and animated movies go, this was ok. The animation looked really nice, I liked the protagonist and Maui, music was pretty enjoyable to listen to (The Rock's song was my favorite, crab guy a close second). It did have some deeper and timeless themes, but it only slightly touched on them. The lack of depth and rather bare and inconsequential story is why I'm giving this only a 6 instead of something higher (for example I think The Croods did a much better job tackling tradition vs the future and exploring a new world. It was also much funnier).So as far as adults and animated movies go, this isn't one of the best and it doesn't offer much, although it is still enjoyable. I'm sure the kids will love it, so definitely set an evening aside and watch it with them if you have any!6/10
Pros:
-Likeable characters
-New take on accompanying animal/entity
-Nice animation
-Nice musicCons:
-Superficial - deeper themes only briefly touched upon
-No real compelling villain or enemy",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Probably the worst animated Movie i've seen so far!,"This Movie is just horrible to watch. The story is predictable, the singing is utterly disgusting and hard to endure. It's so boring aswell.

Brings out the hero in you.,"Starting with the best part of the movie, is how well they have potrayed determination and will power in the movie, that if you are well encouraged you can do anything. Certain parts of the movie were adding to a disappointment that Moana is just 8 year old, and she can do wonders. But then this was a cartoon movie so how realistic can it be? So that's okay.
Overall its a good family movie. And you can watch it over and over again and you will not get bored.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
need moana 2 asap plss,"The animation is stunning, and the songs are total bangers ""How Far I'll Go"" is an anthem, no cap. On repeat 24/7.Moana herself is a total boss, with mad courage and a heart of gold. Watching her journey across the ocean is a wild ride, and the chemistry between her and Maui is hella entertaining. Maui's got that swagger and the rock, so you know he's bringing the heat.The story's got some serious heart and a killer message about finding your own path. If you're down for a magical adventure with dope tunes and a strong heroine, Moana is definitely worth your time. It's pure Disney magic and totally awesome!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Moana – A Good Slice of Disney Cheese,"2016 was a busy year for animated films hitting the box office and big screens, with hit movies such as 'Zootopia' and 'Kubo & The Two Strings' being ever prevalent as some of the most popular films to debut that year - It's no surprise to me that 'Moana' followed the same musical legacy that Walt Disney studios like to traditionally strive for.Disney's 'Moana' follows the events after demigod Maui (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) steals the heart of the goddess Te Fiti, plunging the island into a watery abyss. As Muai escapes the sinking island, he is soon confronted by the Lava Monster (Te Kā), a heartless and destructive creature with a fiery disposition. Maui is defeated in battle and sinks further into the depths, becoming but a memory to the humans or a children's bedtime story. With the threat of growing darkness making its way over the Polynesian coast; Moana, a young girl caught in personal conflict between her love of her village she is destined to lead and dreams of sailing the waters beyond the reef, must find the courage to find the lost demigod and restore order to the land.While the film itself lacks the many intricate details that movies such as 'Zootopia' included, Moana is the traditional bit of cheese that gives Walt Disney it's popular family image, with a wide range of musical numbers that provide enjoyment like their previous counterparts. In no way was it shocking that I found myself humming out the tune of ""You're Welcome"" performed by Dwayne Johnson as Lin- Manuel Miranda manages to bring a vibrant culture into a soundtrack that's accessible for all ages. They're easy to listen to, an absolute pleasure to play on repeat and manage to remain relevant to their purpose. The animation is on point throughout the movie, equalling the same amount of intricate programming as the two previous films mentioned – all the while keeping the same, alluring charm that Disney continues to nail.One thing that Disney manages to do without fail is their choice in voice actors: Dwayne Johnson seems to completely blend in with Maui's egotistical and fun-loving image, yet still remain comfortable enough with his voice to sing a musical number. Auli'i Carvalho definitely manages to hold her own sense of individuality against the star, giving a strong voice to a very modern and highly driven female character. Moana proves that you are always capable of creating a female character that doesn't depend on the validation of a male counterpart or even a shoehorned romantic sub-plot. It was a highly refreshing character to see after 'Frozen' pushed Disney back to the same outdated representation of naive girls risking everything for love.Overall, Moana did not fail to disappoint me. It's above the expectations of 'Frozen' and more on the level of enjoyment that 'Tangled' provided young girls when it first debuted. For families, it is an adventure of self-discovery and confidence that will definitely bring a smile to your face.Great music, an okay-ish story and an idiotic chicken.

The Different Kind of Lovable Disney Princess and A Sure Classic Animated Movie,"Well it's been a long time since the last animated movie of Frozen (also by Disney) that I was truly entertained with such film that had a lot of songs. While that movie I watched by myself, I had the pleasure of my wife's company watching this one. And I knew from the first few minutes that she would love this movie till the end (proven by her various emotions during the duration of the movie). This movie was very very good in term of story and the quality of the animation which made the characters look soooo much alive. I could picture Grandma in real life and also Maui (who I pictured would look like Dwayne Johnson). The songs in this movie were mostly gorgeous with the one sung by Auli'i especially nice (I think it was titled How Far I'll Go).This is a movie for all audience. I am very sure children would be entertained by the funny scenes involving Heihei (the dumbest chicken we have seen, LOL), while the more adults would be happy to see the adventure and the moral of the story. It is mainly about a girl trying to find out her real destiny and doing everything she can to fulfill it because she felt it was her responsibility. It was a different kind of princess than the usual Disney princesses (this was mentioned very cleverly by the writers through Maui when he talked about this in the first few scenes of him together with Moana in the ocean). Another thing that was a bit different from the previous Disney movies such as Zootopia or Jungle Book, was the fact that in this movie, the animals do not speak.In addition to those, the relationship built between Moana and Maui, plus the strong presence of Grandma made the whole movie truly felt like a complete Disney style animated movie. Well done Disney team, you have done it again!For those of you who have not watched this movie, please go there and see it. And please do not be late, as there was a very great short story presented before the movie started. I am very sure those working people like me, would appreciate such a lovely story. Oooh and another thing. Apparently there was also an end credit scene which I did not know of. So if you have not seen it, do not leave your seats till the very end. I understand it would show something that people who watched Disney's animated movies could relate to.For my complete review, pls have a look at michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""Moana""","So I just watched ""Moana"". I've been watching and re-watching some Disney/Pixar flicks. Unfortunately, I think I have to admit that Disney and Pixar movies aren't for me anymore. I think what was amazing about what both companies did in the '90s was that they showed adults that they could love kids' entertainment too. I might be just too jaded now though.Don't get me wrong, I still love ""The Lion King"" and ""Toy Story"", but those are both cultural milestones. I know kids love modern Disney flicks like ""Frozen"" and ""Moana"", but they may have left us adults behind. Oh well.I have to wonder why the quality of the music in these always-musical flicks has declined. There's one memorable song in ""Moana"", but nothing half as memorable as ""Circle of Life"", ""Hakuna Matata"", ""A Whole New World"". Even though I didn't like ""Aladdin"" that much on re-watch, I was still absolutely humbled by that track. They did have the legendary lyricist Sir Tim Rice on hand (and Elton John with ""Lion King""). But why don't they go all out with music now? I take it Disney isn't hurting for money (though after losing a quarter of a bill last year, Pixar might be).The movie looks amazing of course, and the voice acting is typically top notch, particularly from the girl who voices the main character, and Temuera Morrison as her dad, and of course, The Rock as Maui. I had my doubts about The Rock's abilities here, but I was happy to be proven wrong.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Must See Disney Original,"First things first.Disney once again gives us an original short prior to the feature called Inner Workings. It picks up where Inside Out left off, whereas we get to see how the human mind/body works. I'm not entirely convinced kids, especially younger kids will appreciate this one, but it hits a powerful chord with every working adult. Boring, Boring, and Glum resonates to the point where I laughed almost as much to keep from crying as I did from the pure humor.As for the newest Disney Original feature film of Moana, words like beautiful, delightful, funny, exciting, thrilling, action packed, innovative, charming, mesmerizing, emotional, and inspiring leap to mind. While for the most part, I'm loving the sequels the company has been doing, Moana recaptures the magic and wonder of Disney original stories and makes me extremely happy this is the course they'll be pursuing again. I'm a fan!The largely Pacific islands cast with the exception of Dwayne Johnson as the voice of Maui, Nicole Scherzinger, and Alan Tudyk is unfamiliar to me. However, the perfection in the casting is undeniable. The characters these actors create are comforting, warm, three dimensional.The musical score, includes songs by Lin-Manuel Miranda (of Hamilton fame) perfectly accentuates and punctuates the story elevating the level of entertainment. Plenty of toe tapping and seat dancing to be had. While none of the songs will most likely reach Let I Go proportions, I defy you not to laugh, hum along and get You're Welcome stuck in your head.Others have tried, maybe even come close, but no one tops Disney/Pixar animators when it comes to water animation. No one. The overall animation is also out of this world. There's great us combined 2D and 3D animation to make the story pop, especially the mythology sequences. The research done to capture the vivid colors and textures of the Pacific Islands flora and fauna gives Moana an unsurpassed tactility. I wanted to jump on the next plane to see islands myself.I thoroughly enjoyed myself and can't give Moana anything but a 10 and look forward to adding it to my personal movie collection to enjoy for years to come.ALERT for you folks that dash out as soon as the credits roll. Stick around to the end. Enjoy the closing credits music because there's a final scene when all is said and done that will make you smile.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Not the Disney Experience I had Hoped for, but Entertaining Nonetheless,","Moana is a good movie with a well written plot and a terrific vocal cast. It is an entertaining Disney film that boasts plenty of highly enjoyable, as well as catchy, musical numbers that make the movie shine, particularly How Far I'll Go and You're Welcome. The voice cast is also terrific, with Hollywood star Dwayne Johnson really shining in this role, and newcomer Auli'i Cravalho really owning a huge, challenging character.I did feel that the film lacked originality. I did not see anything here that I have not already seen in other Disney princess films, it follows the exact same story beats as the other movies, without doing anything extraordinary or unconventional to make up for this.As well as that, the story never truly pulled me in, while films such as Mulan and Tangled really gripped me, there was never a moment where I felt truly engrossed with this plot. I had to really try to watch it rather than being taken away.Reasonable Disney fun. While it is not what I had hoped for, Moana is still certainly an enjoyable 90 minutes that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good family film.A young Hawaiian must seek out and find a Demigod in order to bring peace to her island.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Forgettable,"Meh. Just meh. Super meh in fact. This movie is so meh that I don't even want to force myself into trying to remember it.

"A fun, beautifully animated adventure.","2016 was a pretty good year for animation films and what a great way to end it with Moana!This film didn't seem as interesting as it actually turned out to be and that's what made it stronger most likely. First, the animation is top notch and since the setting is set in fictional Pacific islands, you can count on gorgeous colors and fantastic landscapes. It would be beautiful in and of itself to watch this film with just music to it since every frame is a work of meticulous art. The music is also very entertaining to listen to although you won't be getting ""Let if Go"" out of your heads; not with this one at least.The story itself is one kids and adults can get into and has very relatable things like independence, adventure, self-worth, identity, and so on. Every portion of the film presents something new and interesting to hold interest and keep you wondering what will come next. The ending is predictable but that shouldn't be a problem for the younger audience.At times, the pacing and story structure get a little jumbled and confused which makes some transitions through scenes a bit rougher. For the most part, however, it's a smooth ride and an enjoyable one at that. Moana is highly recommended as a great addition to the Disney family recently. Not the best you've ever seen but certainly an enjoyable one you wouldn't mind watching more than once.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Moana goes on a quest, gets the help from certain characters and finds herself along the way.

Awesome Disnay movie ever,"Another wonderful movie to add to the Disney classics. 2016 has been a particularly strong year for animated films. With the likes of Zootopia, Finding Dory and Kubo & The Two Strings all vying for best animated picture of the year, it seems Moana deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as well. It is awesome movie.A small pounamu stone that is the mystical heart of the goddess Te Fiti is stolen by the demigod Maui, who was planning to give it to humanity as a gift. As Maui makes his escape, he is attacked by the lava demon Te Kā, causing the heart of Te Fiti as well as his power-granting magical fish hook to be lost in the ocean.Young Moana Waialiki, daughter and heir of the chief on the small Polynesian island of Motunui, is chosen by the ocean to receive the heart, but drops it when her father, Chief Tui, comes to get her. He insists the island provides everything the villagers need. Years later, fish become scarce and the island's vegetation begins dying. Moana proposes going beyond the reef to find more fish. Chief Tui rejects her request, as sailing past the reef is forbidden.Moana's grandmother, Gramma Tala, shows Moana a secret cave behind a waterfall, where she discovers her ancestors were voyagers, sailing and discovering new islands across the world. Tala explains that they stopped voyaging because Maui stole the heart, causing monsters to appear in the ocean. Tala then reveals that the darkness has been spreading from island to island, slowly killing, and now Motunui is next.Tala falls ill and with her dying breaths tells Moana to set sail. Moana and her pet chicken Heihei depart in a drua to find Maui to restore the heart of the goddess Te Fiti.After a typhoon wave flips her sailboat and knocks her unconscious, she awakens the next morning on an island inhabited by Maui, who traps her in a cave and takes her sailboat to search for his fishhook. After escaping and catching up to Maui, Moana tries to convince him to return the heart, but Maui refuses, fearing its power will attract dark creatures.Immediately after, sentient coconut pirates called Kakamora surround the boat and steal the heart, but Maui and Moana retrieve it. Maui agrees to help return the heart to Te Fiti, but only after he reclaims his hook, which is hidden in Lalotai, the Realm of Monsters, and held by Tamatoa, a giant coconut crab. They successfully retrieve it by tricking Tamatoa. After Maui have his hook, Fearful that returning to fight Te Kā will destroy his hook, Maui abandons Moana.Moana still want to return the heart from the ocean to Te Fiti alone. Maui, having had a change of heart, returns to help Moana. Maui distract the lava demon, and his hook is destroyed in the battle. Realizing that Te Kā is actually Te Fiti without her heart, Moana asks the ocean to clear a path for Te Kā to approach her. She sings a song, asking Te Kā to remember who she truly is, allowing Moana to restore her heart. Te Fiti returns and in gratitude, gives a new canoe to Moana and a new magical hook to Maui before returning to her island form.Moana bids farewell to Maui and returns to her recovering island with Heihei. Later, the villagers begin voyaging and set sail in search of new islands, as Maui and Tala accompany them in their giant hawk and manta ray forms, respectively.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Disappointing *possible spoiler?*,"One of the magical qualities of a Disney cartoon movie is the romance between its characters.I grew up idealizing Princess Aurora, Belle, Jasmine, Ariel etc... all of these women were strong and independent. They didn't need a man either, but there was always tasteful romance set up in one way.Our world is a horrible place sometimes. Movies are suppose to help us escape the reality of the world and take us to mythical places. They are the thing of dreams that carry us to what might be possible. With Moana Disney cut romance out all together. So what, now countless of our daughters are going to grow up thinking that they don't need a man at all...that they can be harry lonely cat people with no children of their own because they don't need a man? The movie was funny. I liked the character herself, but now I'm not so sure I want my daughter to go to the next Disney movie. I want her to have fairy tales too.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

The voice acting is first rate. The young lady who voices Moana is terrific and Dwayne Johnson continues to show his amazing abilities and range as an actor and entertainer. The story is also a surprise. It is not overbearing and heavy handed like most Disney animations. I also like the way it makes fun of other Disney princess movies.

I know this is supposed to be a ""kids film"" but I'd watch this into my 90's. Coming from New Zealand I really feel Moana was the most relatable Disney movie I've seen, considering Maui pulled NZ up out of the ocean. I know this isn't the first Disney movie with a princess (or in this case, chief's daughter) of colour, but I feel like this was really the most connected to the culture.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Disney really masters computeranimation with this one, but that's about it.","To start off with my highest praise for Moana: The visuals are spectacular. The water effects are masterfully crafted and the moving tattoos on the body of Maui are entertaining in their liveliness.The climax is also something I hadn't seen coming, and I say that, because out of everything in the movie THAT was the one thing I really didn't predict. Seriously, if you know the Disney movies you'll be able to predict almost every turn.The sidekick of Maui is pretty entertaining, but that blasted Hei-Hei is pretty much pointless and annoying through out the movie.How Far I'll Go was beautiful and You're Welcome was also memorable. The whole soundtrack captured the culture of the Polynesian people very well, but the overall film was kind of a disappointment and to be honest I fell asleep during the first watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Cool Disney Princess, in a great story (Does not hurt to have The Rock in your corner)","I'm gonna go out on the limb and say the Rock may have had some influence on this movie being made. That at least someone at Disney who was a fan of Dwayne Johnson, saw his Samoan heritage and said we should make a movie about a Pacific Island Demigod so he can voice it.Moana will charm the paints off of you. It puts a smile on your face that does not go away.Can't help but to compare this Disney Princess with the one from Brave. They have a lot in common being strong female princesses capable of slaying there own dragon, but I like Moana better because she stands even more differently than most Disney princesses, and Not just because of the color of her skin. This movie was never about a girl who had to prove herself to some man, it's not a love story, it's about a young person wanting something more than what her safety zone can give her, a good lesson for both daughters and sons. Plus, I like how Disney does a little poke at itself addressing the stereotypes of Disney Princesses always being in dresses and having a animal sidekick, In this case, Moana is joined on her journey by a bird brained chicken who can't tell the difference between a rock and food.Oh, and speaking of the Rock, let's get back to him and how awesome he was in this flick as Maui, a egotistical trickster spending too much time talking about how amazing he is. With any other voice he would be a jerk, but not in the hands of Mr. Johnson. The Rock even gives us a classic Disney song that has been stuck in my head for days now.The animation was very good in this film as well. Typical of Disney movies they try to respect the culture that they are taking the story from, which oddly gives it the essence of another Disney animated feature about a Demigod, Hercules. Very similar with animation upon animation coming to life (But instead of carvings from a Greek temple it's , Maui's tattoos that have a personality all on it's own).Absolutely worth every dime to see it in 3D too. The movie is big just like the water they sail across and it's big like the bad guys they face, and you want to see that in a big theater.Worth checking out.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Typical Disney magic and incredible debuts!,"So Disney makes a much needed return to Polynesia since Lilo & Stitch being a vibrant and lush part of the world to set any story in; and with Disney being Disney they know exactly how to make use of that remarkable world.We're planted in an ancient era of myth and tradition far away from technology, where legends, curses and demigods still exist setting the scene for a typical adventure. The world as they know it is under threat and only under certain conditions can this be stopped and of those conditions Moana has to go against her over protective father and tribal chief, and leave the island, which has been forbidden.Introducing Auli'i Cravalho as the youngest Disney Princess at the age of 14, and her acting debut! Apparently being the last of a very long audition process she was the one who won them over with her fearless and playful wit who didn't seem to falter under pressure sharing a lot of qualities of the character of Moana. She's amazing and no one would guess this is not only her first film, but her first screen appearance full stop. No reality TV, or music videos, but here with Moana straight in at the deep end performing her own songs too. Have to say, quite a daring choice not having the experience and taking the title role to have Disney invest in Cravalho but by Te Fiti, it was a worthy risk.Now she has to find and enlist the help of Maui, the egotistical, self righteous and self obsessed Demigod who's obviously played by Dwayne Johnson. Though not his first Disney outing, it is his animated debut and even though it's reported he was quite self conscious, citing voice acting to be the hardest form of the art, he done an amazing job, and HE CAN SING! The Rock, Hobbs and the Scorpion King treating us to a medley, making it his debut musical as well. They capture Johnson's mannerisms and movements really well, including his trademark People's Eyebrow adding to the few Disney Easter eggs to look out for that reference many of Disney's and Musker/Clements' work.I would love to see behind the scenes purely for this, to watch and hear this gigantic man singing away, and to see the chemistry between Cravalho and himself. Can you imagine how intimidating it might have been for her, not only being entirely new but to share a platform with the people's champion. She was clearly in good, big hands and I believe the film reflects that.There appears to be a good understanding for the ancient ways of the Polynesian ancestors displaying navigation by way of the nightsky and the currents, and their profound respect for nature and the spirit of the ocean, seeing them as deities that provide them with life and meaning.Ron Clements and John Musker, the geniuses behind Disney classics like Treasure Planet, The Little Mermaid and a personal favourite, Aladdin direct, though they're not directing alone so credit also to Big Hero 6 directors Chris Williams and Don Hall who I'm assuming was mostly responsible for the CGI animation being a good mixture of the two resulting in beautiful , magical animation that urges me to return to Disney World so bad!There's plenty to watch with the typical mascots that brings the story together, Maui's honest and silent tattoo and Heihei, the blundering chicken that provides a lot of the comedy of the story. But, there's wasn't enough screen time for the others. I wanted to see more of the coconuts as an example.Something else it lacked was empathy, I didn't feel totally connected to the characters as I did with other Disney characters and I can't really explain why. It's just I didn't feel sad enough at the points of the story where I should have.There was a tease of a good score from Mark Macina with an intro that immediately reminded me of The Lion King opening, that I use to purposefully play upon waking up in the morning. Naturally, the songs are good with some instant recognisable sing-a-long tracks like ""You're Welcome"", ""How Far Will I Go"" and ""Shiny"" that sounds influenced by Bowie.It's of the usual high standard Disney provides, dazzling animation, funny characters with a strong moral message about brave ambition. Its highly entertaining and I have no doubt majority of kids will love it, especially Heihei the chicken.Running Time: 8 The Cast: 9 Performance: 9 Direction: 8 Story: 8 Script: 8 Creativity: 8 Soundtrack: 7 Job Description: 7 The Extra Bonus Points: 10 for Johnson's animated/singing debut and of course, Cravahlo debut.

Island girl,"This was another highly enjoyable Disney CGEN feature with an exciting story, lots of laughs, good songs, fine characterisation and most of all, brilliant animation.From the depiction of luxuriant tropical wildlife, frothy ocean spray and most of all the nuances of the ""human"" characters, the film is a feast for the eyes. As for the ears, they are well served too by catchy, idiomatic, singalong numbers and witty, funny dialogue not scared to run a little risqué to get a laugh.The story, of Disney necessity, touches on the tried and true, a young independent ""princess"", yearning for change and adventure, surmounting seemingly insurmountable odds on a quest to save the day, accompanied of course by a wise-cracking companion and just to top things off, a cute, dumb pet.The songs even if they seem like they've fallen off the same wagon as those in ""Frozen"" are nonetheless mostly pleasant and memorable and are well sung by the cast, even Dwayne Johnston. My main carp would be the use of derivative minion-lite coconut pirates Moana and Maui encounter on their journey but otherwise I found myself frequently caught up by the duo's escapades and interaction arriving at a big happy ever after climax which outdid the rest of the SFX in the process.Lovely film, first class family entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
yet another in a long line of Disney princess movies,"I was... underwhelmed. Moana follows the standard Disney princess theme with less variation than I hoped. Disney is expert at manipulating your emotions. But Pixar is excellent at providing a story to go with it. This time, Disney won and Pixar lost. Not a lot of there there.What's odd is that Zootopia is just an amazing film. Zootopia crushes Moana on every level. Even the music. But then, Zootopia has a story to tell. All the difference in the world, that is.As an aside, Disney apparently put in a lot of work to find an ethnically authentic princess in Auli'i Cravalho. Yet, if I read the credits correctly, she shared credit with another lass for the songs. I'm not sure what that means in the world of animation, but it does leave one scratching one's head wondering what one just heard.Disney, go back and look at Zootopia again.

Whenever you feel that this again would be similar to what we have seen before and there Disney is with yet another unique concept.Moana is a story of a young girl who sails through the sea to find a demigod Maui, who will help her to save her island. It is a musical which has great songs (reminded me of Frozen) and heart touching background score. The story is simple but sensible and amazingly executed.It is NOT a spoiler, there is a chicken which made me laugh so hard tears fell from my eyes.Moana is a perfect blend of everything important for an animated movie to be likable and enjoyed by all. This is definitely one of the best Disney has delivered. Watch this movie if you like, well, just watch this movie I am sure you will like it.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
'Moana' - Another Classic hit by Walt Disney Animations,"Unwilling to fix what ain't broke, Disney hews pretty closely to its usual narrative structure in ""Moana,"" while at the same time further expanding its geographical boundaries far from the original Germanic fairy tales that provided the studio's stories for so many decades. Rather than revel in the South Seas kitsch that gave us the Enchanted Tiki Room, this adventure pays fitting tribute to both the natural beauty and the creation myths of the Pacific Islands. If we're looking at the journey and not the destination, ""Moana"" is thoroughly entertaining if never completely groundbreaking. Moana does what is needed for a good Disney film. With outstanding Visual effects and good musical score, Moana will definitely make its nomination in Best Animated Picture in Oscars. I go with 4/5 for beautifully made Walt Disney creation 'Moana'.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Simple yet engaging plot with a beautiful message. I particularly enjoyed the character development of Moana and Maui.,"""Moana"" conveys a beautiful message about self-discovery, understanding what we want out of our life and which path we want to follow. We should not feel too much pressure from people around us to make certain decisions that do not make sense with ourselves. The plot structure is a bit of a return to the origins for Disney: stories with a moral that are easy to follow and that everyone can enjoy. I liked how the journey of Moana was portrayed: it is a constant rollercoaster of tough moments and achievements that will bring the two protagonists to work together in order to accomplish their mission. The relationship between Moana and Maui has an interesting development, where we see them slowly gaining trust and respect for each other. Auli'i and The Rock provided a solid interpretation and the songs were a nice addition that actively contributed to progress the script. The magical element was nicely integrated in the movie and I am happy that the director did not rely too much on it, providing a balanced product. The comedic relief represented by the rooster Heihei was genuinely funny, but I feel that some of the scenes could be cut off, as the jokes were very repetitive, to the point that it got annoying.The film has vibrant colours that transported me to a lush world, even on the darkest scenes. The water animations were particularly stunning, with many particle effects that enriched the visuals. Considering that the movie has as its unique location the ocean, I believe that the director absolutely nailed this part. Overall it is an enjoyable movie that presented to the audience a brand new intellectual property, and not yet another remake of a Disney princess classic with enhanced graphics. Who knows? Maybe by presenting original characters, Disney Animation Studios might create a new generation of classics. Final rate: 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Moannnna!,"This animation has a wonderful story line that I found adventurous and captivating! So I get that this animation might be standard Disney formula, which some perceive as predictable and boring, but here's what I feel sets this story apart from some typical Disney films. Moana, the heroine, is NOT a princess. She is destined to be chief. Rarely (if ever), has there been a female chief in ancient Polynesia, and I loved that Disney made this happen! Moana doesn't fall in love with a prince or meet a handsome warrior. She meets mischievous Maui, who actually gives her lots of grief at first, but eventually empowers her. I enjoyed how their relationship develops and that it didn't have to be romantic to be interesting. Also, not to spoil anything, but keep an eye out for hidden Easter eggs throughout! We spotted a couple of homages to Big Hero 6 and Frozen. Clever!The story incorporates the historical legends of Maui, and I personally have a deep appreciation for Polynesian history and culture. My family and I were excited when we discovered Disney was coming out with an animation about the Polynesian superman, aka Maui, aka demigod. Of course, Disney may have Disnified some aspects or left out some details about the legend, but the song ""You're Welcome"" summed up several of Maui's accomplishments in various versions of the myth. We found the tale fascinating and the characters moving, even that silly chicken!The story is set in a fictitious Polynesian island, perhaps in likeness to Samoa or Tokelauan. The music was rhythmic and catchy. We downloaded the soundtrack right after the movie and have been enjoying it!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney goes far in 'Moana',"Disney Animation Studios has been on a hot streak for a number of years now, and 2016's 'Moana' was another example of how far the studio will go to release films that resonate with its audiences. While we are clearly beyond the days of the classic 2D animated movies that audiences of all ages fell in love with, 'Moana' proves it's possible to capture the magic of this era through quick wit, lots of laughs and, of course, catchy songs.The film follows the story of a young Polynesia princess who's forbidden from leaving her homeland - an island in the South Pacific. As is the case in most Disney pictures, the protagonist, Moana (voiced by Auli'i Cravalho), defies convention and embarks on a journey to find a demigod named Maui (Dwayne Johnson) so she can retrieve Te Fiti's heart, an ancient artifact that is needed to restore order to the open seas. This plot is nothing spectacular - it's pretty basic, but is in line with what's needed for a foundation of a great animated film.""Moana''s strengths are obvious. From the beautiful scenery brought to life through animation, where everything in nature appears to be alive - even the inanimate ocean, to the standard comedic moments that are expected in Disney movies (most of which come at the expense of Maui), there is plenty to enjoy about the film. The standout for sure is Cravalho, as her vocals are impressive on the soundtrack, including its biggest hit, ""How Far I'll Go."" As a heroine, Moana is fiercely independent and self-sufficient - a strong role model particularly for young girls. The only areas that feel a bit lacking are the few number of characters - much less compared to traditional Disney movies - and the fact that there is no traditional villain (think Jafar, Cruella de Vil, Scar, etc,). That said, there's plenty of action and adventure to keep audiences engaged.While not the most memorable story, 'Moana' is a fun, free-spirited adventure and is an example of how Disney is continuing to explore new areas while working with a proven formula for success.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Cliche But Still Fun,"If you're a fan of Frozen or other Disney classics of the past you should enjoy yourself. Just do not expect anything new story wise or tropes wise. The film doesn't have any deep societal messages like Zootopia either. However, just because something is formulaic does not automatically make it bad. It's all in the execution and if it's able to bring something fresh and unique to the table to make-up for it. Disney, Pixar, and Marvel have been able to this and Moana is no exception.The story and characters are basic and nothing you haven't seen in other Disney films, or just other adventure films. You have the title character Moana that lives with her family and tribe on this remote island. She dreams of going out there and exploring beyond the island but everyone, including her family, tells her not to. But eventually an evil threatens their home and one of her family members dies. Now she has to venture out and face this threat along with her comic relief animal sidekick (who surprisingly does not speak in this) and trusted partner Maui (Dwayne Johnson). At first the two of them do not get along but eventually grow to respect one another. It hit virtually every Disney trope.However, the film manages to make-up for this in other areas. The visuals, music (some of it), and culture the films portrays is actually something new for Disney. The lore the movie presents is also quite different and interesting. Most of all, the film has heart, which is something Disney almost always has in its films.The acting is on-point from everyone in the cast. The visuals are stunning and the score perfectly complements them. The songs are great too. They're not as memorable as Frozen or other Disney classics, but they're above average. There is one song that, in my opinion, is on that level though.Overall, Moana is definitely a Disney film, in a good way. Again, if you like Frozen, Big Hero Six, or other Disney films like them you'll enjoy this. Children will definitely love it.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Styx song doesn't work,"Love the Styx song, ""Come Sail Away"" but the song is clearly about aliens who come to the planet and we sail off with them into space. Maybe they should think next time about the perky music and the lyrics that may fit for the film. But no one will care when the toys and shirts and other junk stay around Walmart like ""Cars"" merchandise ten plus years from now. The song will outlast the movie. Where was the songwriting like what was kicked down for, ""Frozen""? It also seems that what separates this film from classics like ""Lion King"" and other epic Disney spectaculars is the lack of musical inspiration that set those films alone at the top. Is it that hard to come up with a new song or just pay the royalties and fish around for an old REO Speedwagon or Journey song?!",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Stunning,"In all honesty, I enjoyed this movie more than Frozen. Perhaps that's due to the amount of times I've heard Let it Go in the past three years, but nonetheless, I believe Moana knocks it out of the park. The unique narrative and stunning animations alone make it outstanding. Not to mention, my inner Hamilton nerd was freaking out at the parts when I heard Lin Manuel Miranda sing. The characters are intriguing, and I think Moana herself is among one of my favorite Disney princesses (even if she doesn't technically qualify). She has a fierce personality, and it's clear Disney wanted to present a strong-female-lead. And they did so in a way that wasn't in your face about it (as many movies do). I was also surprised at how well Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson did in his role as Maui. I never knew the guy could sing, but I was greatly surprised. The flaws I found in the movie are very nit-picky, but I think they deserve to be brought up. For one, a lot of the characters seem to change their minds on things a lot quicker than I expected, and it was kind of jarring, in particular, Maui's character had a weird change of heart in the story that felt out of place. I also wasn't a huge fan of Hay-hay, the chicken sidekick. Was kind of hoping they stuck with the pig. But all in all, I highly recommend checking this film out.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A journey of discovery unlike any other,"After ""Frozen"", comes a ""summer-like"" Disney movie that is unlike any other animated movie you have seen.

Multi-layered throughout as it deals with concepts of ""community"", ""roots"", ""exploration"" and ""faulty-parental guidance"" Even the characters sound real given an exceptionally smart script that makes you forget at some point that you are watching an animation, thanks to a fast paced and meticulous plot that has more than one surprise embedded in it.

A Solid Adventure with a Few Tides,"Moana sails into a visually stunning oceanic world filled with vibrant colors and catchy tunes. The animation is top-notch, and the voice acting, especially Auli'i Cravalho as Moana, brings the characters to life. The film's exploration of Polynesian culture is both refreshing and educational.However, the plot, while enjoyable, follows a somewhat predictable course, and slme characters lack the depth found in other Disney classics. The music, while catchy, doesn't quite reach the heights of other iconic Disney soundtracks, as well.In the end, ""Moana"" is a solid adventure with heartwarming moments, but it doesn't quite make waves like some of its Disney predecessors. A 7/10 reflects its overall enjoyable nature with room for improvement.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

A New Timeless Classic From Disney,"Moana is the latest in a slew of CG animated movies from Disney, with Tangled, Frozen, and Zootopia preceding it, so needless to say I had some very high expectations for Moana. Were they fulfilled? Absolutely!Let's talk about the characters first. Moana, the teenage daughter of the village Chief, who wants nothing more than to leave her island and explore the sea, but can't because her father won't let her, but the plants start dying and the fish disappear, she takes it upon herself to go out to sea, find the demigod, Maui, and restore the heart of Te Fiti to restore her village. I have a new favorite Disney princess. Moana is an absurdly likable and relatable character who never plays the role of the typical, annoying, immature teenager. I liken her to being kind of like Ariel, from The Little Mermaid, but much better written. Maui, the powerful demigod who has lost his magic fishhook, is a complete jerk and I love him for it. Dwayne Johnson's undeniable charm and humor shines through even in this arrogant, selfish, and egotistical character. Speaking of performances, this is the debut of an outstanding new talent in Auli'i Cravalho. She absolutely kills it as Moana, not only standing alongside Dwayne Johnson, but even sometimes outperforming him. I really do hope for a very successful career for this incredibly talented young actress. Did I mention her singing voice?The music in Moana is also amazing. Lin-Manuel Miranda composes this movie to perfection. I could listen to this soundtrack all day, though two songs in particular stand out: How Far I'll Go and You're Welcome. These are arguably some of the best songs to come out of Disney in the past 20 years.Now to talk about the aesthetic qualities. This is one of the most beautiful animated movies I have ever seen. Everything seems so vibrant and alive, it seems magical, which any proper Disney picture should be.Overall, I had a great time watching Moana. I think it has a good message, very likable characters, a phenomenal soundtrack, and gorgeous visuals. Don't miss this one.The End",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
It's Fine,"I've always stood by the belief that just because something is pretty does not make it good. This movie definitely reflects that sentiment. It is very pretty in its own right. It was beautifully animated and it a wonderfully colorful spectacle, but that's it. The characters themselves are very shallow in actual characterization. There is very little development that actually goes on between any of the characters, especially between Moana and Maui. What development that does happen is expected and not very original. It all also happens so quickly that there isn't enough time dedicated to the details needed to push their relationship or the story forward.And, as far as story goes, there really isn't much of one. It's a very simple quest that had so much potential to be a grand adventure, but it just wasn't there. There wasn't enough of an adventure to keep me engrossed. It played everything very safe and didn't take enough chances. It could have been so much more, but it just wasn't enough. So, it left me feeling kind of empty at the end. I wanted more from it and instead it was just like a passing moment. It's there, then It's gone, and I won't remember it later on.It honestly felt a lot like a sandbox game. Anything can happen because there isn't enough lore to set everything in stone, but at the same time nothing of significance can happen because there's nothing grounding it to a specific plot. Sadly, this isn't a game and the latter is the case for this movie. So much more could have happened, but instead not enough does to keep my interest.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation

A breath of fresh air in Disney's animated library,"Disney goes back to their roots with a heartwarming story about a ""princess"" named Moana of Motunui, as she expressed it several times throughout the film. It's a tale of mysticism and heroism that made me truly feel connected to my inner childhood. 
In the movie, Moana is chosen by the power of the ocean to search for the demigod Maui, voice by Dwayne Johnson, and reunite the heart-relic of a fallen goddess in order restore life in the island.The cast did an amazing job voicing each character and singing all the songs that accompanied the movie in such perfect ways. One of the most astonishing scenes of the film was with the giant treasure-hoarding crab, voiced impeccably by Jemaine Clement. The imagery of the underwater world owned by the crab was simply stunning, at times reminding me of the sub-aquatic terrors of ""Finding Nemo"".""Moana"" is filled with clever bits and pieces, like Maiu's tattoos or the shapeshift end-results of his ability or Heihei the clumsy rooster.The songs written by ""Hamilton"" alumni Lin-Manuel Miranda are the best things I have heard in recent years, with the song ""You're Welcome"" at the very top.""Moana"" established itself as one of the best Disney animated feature films of all time.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

I know hair and water are part of the hardest things to produce in computer graphics.Thumbs up!I see some trolls in the reviews, I wonder if they are paid to bring down movies? hehe!

"Expect a fun, good time. But has room for potential","Moana is a beautiful and stunning film, the best parts of the film being the animation and the music, of course with Lin-Manuel MIranda on board this project. So Moana is actually an animated film that I've been following since they casted Auli'i Cravalho, I watched the clip released by Disney in which they told her that she got the part, along with Dwayne Johnson being on board I was immediately attracted to this project. I thought that it was really great that Disney decided to venture to a more different model for their Disney princesses brand and to explore a culture as fascinating as the Polynesian culture.The end result a brilliant film that is really just a fun exciting adventure. The voice acting was stellar both from new comer Auli'i or Dwayne Johnson and it was really great seeing their two characters on screen bonding and getting used to working together. The music in the film was fun and catchy with very meaningful lyrics without being too in your face and having the characters break into song every scene, the musical pieces were used sparingly and reasonably.So, I would like to compare this to two of Disney's recent properties. First of all: Frozen, Frozen was alright in my opinion, compared to Moana I do believe that Moana is for a slightly more mature audience and though Frozen touches on certain important and deep aspects regarding the love between siblings it seemed a much more introverted film. Of course perhaps due to the actual story of the film however there was always something that never clicked with me when it comes to Frozen and the vast openness of Moana seems to be the difference maker that made me enjoy this movie a lot more. The second film is last year's, Zootopia. Now this is a film that Disney has produced that I feel does a great job in conveying very mature themes. With a film like Moana, it is fun and adventurous but could do with in my opinion some more mature aspects, perhaps touch on issues such as environmental or deal with nature as it sort of already does. I do feel that things like that is the next step for Disney, to really put what they have done in Zootopia into practice on some of its other properties.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A great film. I like.,"Moana is, without a dought, one of the best films of 2016. Another film from legendary Disney directors Ron Clements and John Musker (Little Mermaid and Aladdin) and starring Dwane ""The Rock"" Johnson and newbie Auli'i Cravalho, Moana, Disney's newest princess movie, is a win. The Rock's Maui steals every scene he is in. His great performance enhances his comedy, especially in his musical number ""You're Welcome"". In addition, I didn't know Dwane could sing! But, the best thing about this film is the animation. Moana is so beautiful it rivals Good Dinosaur and Totoro. It's obvious they spent a long time on every single coconut. Yet, every good movie has it's downsides, and Moana is no different. The movie had a few too many inappropriate jokes not done well. A lot of the songs were pretty unmemorable, though I remember liking most of them. All in all: 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Both of their personalities blend together for many natural feel good moments.. and some other.. more dark moments.All in all I cannot promote this enough. We need movies like Moana.

"""Moana"" Finding What She Is Meant to Be","Disney's ""Moana"" is visually spectacular and fun. The blue oceans, the lush tropical islands, and beautiful Polynesian people are vibrantly created in state of the art animation. The songs co-written by Lin- Manuel Miranda of Broadway ""Hamilton"" fame have a Hawaiian flavor and engaging lyrics. Dwayne Johnson voices Demigod Maui with the gusto of The Rock from his WWE days. He almost steals ""Moana"" with his comical zeal and authentic introspection. Newcomer Auli'i Cravalho is enchanting as Moana. She is a young star with a fabulous voice.I grew up in Hawaii and was familiar with some of the Hawaiian mythology. Demigod Maui was the way finder who pulled up the Hawaiian Islands from the ocean with his great fishing hook. ""Moana"" is enjoyable and superbly entertaining. Ironically, while the brave way finders discovered the vast unknown, ""Moana"" ventures into familiar seas.Jared Bush wrote the screenplay for ""Moana"" from the story by Ron Clements, John Musker, Chris Williams, Don Hall and 3 others. Perhaps too many writers. They wrote this kluged narrative and predictable story. This is unfortunate on several levels. ""Moana"" is an homage to Polynesian culture which is rarely depicted in even live-action movies. This is an empowerment tale about the rites of passage of the young girl Moana (Cravalho), heir apparent Chieftain. ""Moana"" echoes the sacred bond of man and the earth. The story albeit inspiring has been done before. Maui (Johnson) says ""High five."" and ""Got your back."" The colloquialisms seem out of place for an ancient tale that is a couple thousand years old. Directors Ron Clements and John Musker smooth out the journey joyously with visuals and song.In the story, Chief Tui (proud and strong Temuera Morrison)—Moana's father, forbid anyone to sail beyond the Island's reef. To save the Island and her people, Moana sails beyond the reef into the great ocean to find Maui. Metaphorically, ""Moana"" might have done the same as its hero, throwing caution to the wind and risking the great unknown.""Moana"" opens as Gramma Tala (strong and gentle Rachel House) tells the story to children of how Maui stole the heart of Te Fiti (Island Goddess). The heart is a green stone that possesses the life force. Upon escaping Maui battles the lava monster Te Ka, and he along with his fishing hook and the heart of Te Fiti are vanquished into to the depths of the sea. In a recurrent Disney signature the story scares the children; all except little Moana. Then the ocean poetically anoints Moana as the chosen one for the heart of Te Fiti.Years pass and Moana's Island is dying—the fishing and crops depleted. Gramma Tala reveals to Moana (Cravalho) she is the one who must return the heart of Te Fiti, and find Maui. To complete the quest she breaks her Father's law to sail beyond the reef. Wise Tala enlightens Moana that she will find what she is meant to be.Johnson and Cravalho charm as the unlikely partners—the woman chieftain and the demigod in redemption. Cravalho voices Moana's strength amidst her self-doubt. She is an awesome singer. The song ""How Far I'll Go"" is moving. Johnson also can carry a tune as Maui. He brings a playful pompousness to the hulking kind of squishy tattooed Maui—so unlike his real chiseled persona. He also displays a compassionate vulnerability, especially when he tells how he became the demigod. He and Cravalho have wonderful chemistry, and give ""Moana"" its big heart. We pull for Maui and Moana on their treacherous journey. They are finding who they are meant to be. That really matters for us. Although familiar, ""Moana"" has brilliant song, amazing sights, and true soul. Enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A New Real Hero,"I've seen this movie today and I really like this movie! Moana is a real hero, she is strong, smart, courageous and funny, something we haven't seen earlier in a female character from Disney. I could never look up to Snow White or Cinderella, when I was little, I would always rather watch the male heroes. Moana is a REAL women, like people call some men REAL men. She saves the world and is a real fighter. The movie is full of humor and is exciting. Moana and demigod Maui encounters one after another interesting enemy. All characters are beautifully developed and thought-out, not one character is annoying or boring. This movie has also a beautiful scene, with many colors and detail and the culture on the island is really nice to experience. Background music fits the scenes too. What I disliked were the musical-like songs, they feel like little breaks from the story, but that is the only negative thing I would point out. I would definitely recommend this movie in the cinema, 10 out of 10!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
It gets worse and worse,"What a total bunch of typical, self-righteous, pro-feminism, anti-masculine, standard Disney, cut and paste garbage. The writers must have used another one of the wealth of 21st century, standardised Disney films and simply altered the names of the characters to produce something 'new'.Dull characters, including a daft chicken who adds nothing, and of course the male is a meaningless, unimportant dunce. The star is of course a run-of-the-mill Disney Princess who of course saves the day and ""breaks the mould"" - yawn.Creativity is dead, and were left with this rubbish.The two stars I've awarded are for the geniuses who animated this movie beautifully, particularly the water which is mesmerisingly good. The void of 8 stars is for everyone else involved in this loser of a film.Put it on, sit your six year old in front of the TV, then leave the room and do something else for an hour and a half. If you have some paint that's drying, then watch that as it will have more story and more interesting characters.What more can I say?",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""Exciting visuals, high-spirited characters and a rich soundtrack.""","Moana is written & directed by Ron Clements, Don Hall, Chris Williams and John Musker and stars Auli'i Cravalho, Dwayne Johnson, Rachel House, Temuera Morrison and Jemaine Clement.In Ancient Polynesia, when a terrible curse incurred by Maui reaches an impetuous Chieftain's daughter's island, she answers the Ocean's call to seek out the demigod and set things right.Walt Disney Animation Studios are famously known for pictures such as Zootopia, Frozen, Wreck-it Ralph, Snow White, The Lion King and many, many more. But, Moana is different. Something about this film really intrigued me - more than just the animation, as usual - and that was the title character, Moana. She's not a princess, and this is stated by the fiery sea voyaging enthusiast, voiced by Auli'i Cravalho, many times during the film. She has a vast amount of abilities and charisma, with a beautiful array of colourful characters to support her in her calling to save the world. I also noticed that, unlike Frozen, the original songs haven't been so incredibly 'out there' during the film's release. This is something that stopped me from seeing Frozen back in 2013 and to this day I still haven't watched it. I didn't like the music I was hearing, but with Moana it's entirely different. I really enjoyed the songs in this film. They have been carefully placed throughout and wonderfully performed by the cast. I must congratulate Auli'i Cravalho on her successful debut and praise her strong vocal range. There's a real cherishable warmth present and it only gives more to the delightful story. Dwayne Johnson is a surprising addition to the list of memorable moments from this film. His character, Maui is hugely energetic, adding a fun and witty shade to the bond between himself and Moana. The supporting cast also did a terrific job of bringing their characters to life, highlighting Rachel House as Grandma Tala.As a big fan of animation and having studied it briefly before, I was excited to see Ancient Polynesia come to life with some of the greatest animators working on the project. With a lot of research and delving into the history of Polynesians, the team have done an extraordinary job of crafting and fine-tuning these characters and environments. The animation is smooth and the visuals vibrant, with some subtle details which most may never notice, but eagle-eyed viewers will love.The original score by Mark Mancina is somewhat disappointing, but only in its overall pay- off. The approach is great, using some of the traditional instruments with the support of Opetaia Foa'i's knowledge in the musical background, but these aren't used nearly as well as they should have been. However, the themes are nicely composed and, as aforementioned, the original songs by Foa'i and Lin-Manuel Miranda are basking in tenderness.Simply put, Moana is a blast. Everyone involved has brought something great to the table and it shines through blissfully. I'd like to see more of this world explored in the future. Not so much in a direct sequel, but with the cultural history and environments so gloriously presented in this film, it would be hard to let go. That said, I've always admired Disney's creativity and diversity.Verdict; Moana utilises a fine blend of exciting visuals, high-spirited characters and a rich soundtrack, becoming one of Disney's finest films yet.Moana, 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Moana: Proof of the 2nd Disney Renaissance,"Disney has been on quite a roll lately with it's films. Over the past few years we have seen instant classics like Frozen and Wreck- it Ralph get released to instant acclaim and this year they delivered two films which are already among their best work, Zootopia and Moana. But while Zootopia was was notable for taking on major themes like racism, Moana is instead more interested with changing or removing elements that are usually found within Disney movies.Moana is the name of the film's protagonist, the daughter of the island chief who longs to explore the ocean against her father's wishes. She discovers that the Ocean has chosen her to sail across the sea to free the demigod Maui (Dwayne Johnson) and return a stone known as the heart of Te Fiti to its home. Maui had removed the stone centuries earlier and unknowingly cursed the world to an ever- growing darkness which is starting to consume Moana's home.The film is one of Disney's most beautiful with the images of the sea and sky looking absolutely astonishing. The film also managed to seamlessly blend 3D animation with traditional hand drawn animation to achieve the effect of Maui's magical/moving tattoos, a feat that has to be seen to believe. The soundtrack is one of the best ones that Disney has made since probably Mulan with the songs ""How Far I'll Go"" and ""You're Welcome"" being particularly fun and entertaining. (I'd like to point out that while ""Let It Go"" is a great song, I found the rest of Frozen's songs to be pretty lame.)Despite all of this, I think Moana's greatest strength lies in the way it subverts typical Disney conventions by discarding the use of a love interest and a main villain. While Moana technically isn't the first Disney princess without a love interest (that honor belongs to Brave's Merida), she is the first one I can think of where her lack of one isn't treated like a big deal. Remember that a key plot point of Brave was the fact that Merida's parents wanted to force her to get married against her wishes. Here though, it's never brought up as a concern. Moana never has to justify her singleness to her parents and her relationship with Maui remains platonic throughout the adventure. There is just too much on the line for her to worry about falling in love and the directors wisely choose to not force a romance into the plot (unlike the makers of Mulan who forced one in to that films detriment).The other notable change made with this film is its lack of a true antagonist. While there are villainous characters in the movie, they mostly serve as obstacles in Moana and Maui's path to return the heart of Te Fiti back to its home. At first the lack of a primary antagonist is a little jarring especially since they tend to be some of Disney's most memorable characters but here I think it was a wise choice to not include one. The stakes are already high enough without adding another layer of needless complexity. Amazingly, the lack of a true antagonist is another point of comparison with Brave which also did not feature a true villain in the classical sense. The big difference between the two of them there though is that Moana tells a simpler and more compelling story that benefits from not having a villain whereas Brave is an uneven mess that falls apart in the second act and might have improved a bit if it at least had a memorable villain.In the end Moana is a welcome addition to the Disney canon. The story is well written, it has beautiful animation, catchy songs, strong performances, and changes up a significant amount of Disney clichés to make it feel fresh and unique. I think we can definitely say at this point that Disney is experiencing a second renaissance.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Moana was another entertaining Disney computer-animated feature,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend who hadn't previously seen it, either. It's the tale of a determined young woman who's trying to resurrect her island with the help of a jewel and a god-like man named Maui. There's also a bunch of songs by Lin-Manuel Miranda provided to give credence to the characterizations. Possibly the Frozen success of Disney's previously computer-animated feature was a factor here. Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) is the voice of Maui and he's funny and quite good with his one song. The title heroine is quite plucky and charismatic. It's possible I might have been partly confused by some of the narrative but still, this was quite entertaining in the usual Disney way. So on that note, me and my friend recommend Moana.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
The real Disney returns...,"It's been several years but Disney seems to have found its groove again when it comes to animated films. ""Moana"" is by far the best they've made in years.The soundtrack is catchy but NOT annoying like some of their other more recent films (Frozen...can't stand ""Let it Go""). In fact I rushed home to purchase a few of the songs from this picture, and for the record I'm a 33-year old male.The story doesn't take itself too seriously, but knows exactly when to stop being silly and deliver a dose of reality. Very minimal cast helped the decently paced 2 hour adventure focus on character development and report. Not that ensembles are bad, but this technique really gave Auli'i Cravalho (Moana) a chance to stand on her own and shine. And shine she did.Great film children and parents a like will enjoy. I cannot recommended it highly enough.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the best Disney animated movies in years!,"Wow,this movie did not disappoint!I didn't think Disney could top Zootopia this year, but I think they just might have.So, it starts on somewhat familiar territory. I've heard a few critics say that it starts like a lot of the Disney fairytale movies - A girl who wants more in her life, and her parents who are far too protective. So what?! I don't care. As long as they can keep retelling this formula in new and creative ways, I have no problem with it. And we've never seen it told in this setting before.The animation is spectacular. I would go as far to say that Moana is the best looking movie of 2016.The characters are really good. Moana is a strong and very likable lead and Maui is at least as likable as the genie from Aladdin. Dwayne Johnson was the perfect choice for Maui. In fact, he literally is an animated Dwayne Johnson!Alan Tudyck, the John Ratzenburger of the present day Disney movies, plays Hei Hei, a comic relief that is used just enough, and never gets annoying, or distracts from the movie's central plot.I also congratulate Disney for not relying on star power, with Dwayne Johnson as an exception. Whereas Frozen, and even Zootopia to a certain degree had a lot of famous names, most of the cast aren't particularly very well known. This is Auli'i Cravalho's first ever movie, and she managed to play the part perfectly.I can't recommend this movie enough. I absolutely loved both Zootopia and Kubo and the two Strings, and didn't think there'd be a better animated movie this year, but I was wrong!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beautiful animation and an all-around fun time brought to us by Disney.,"""Moana"" was as fun and light-hearted as I could have wanted. A truly entertaining piece brought to us by Disney but who could have honestly expected anything different? Before getting into anything else, I have to first bring focus to how beautiful this movie is. The animation is so perfect and wonderfully done that I had moments where I forgot I was watching an animated film. From the models themselves, to the water effects, to the simplest motions. This was a truly beautiful movie to witness... ""Moana"" also was very fluid and entertaining from start to finish. I never sat bored or felt rushed, it was a smooth and easy film to follow. Entertaining for the youngest of watchers to the most seasoned movie goer... Lastly, what is a Disney follow up movie to ""Frozen"" without a little music? The singing pieces within this film was also a bunch of fun to experience. Although I can see other viewers getting annoyed or tired of the music but you come to expect that going into a Disney movie like ""Moana"". I personally enjoyed Dwayne's song ""You're Welcome"" but of course, I am a bit biased when it comes to anything Dwayne.There is not much else I can say beyond what is already said. It is another animated Disney movie, but a brilliantly done one at that. ""Moana"" is a film for all to love and is well deserving of all the kinds of praise it has been getting in recent weeks. Keep an eye out for this one in the future as well for the coming Oscars season.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great movie for kids!,"Saw this with my wife, 3 year-old daughter & mother-in-law & we all loved it. The packed theater of mostly kids & parents seemed to love it & gave it a good round of applause at the end! It is what it is people...a Disney Princess movie with some good laughs, great songs & an overall good family time. For those who didn't like it, I'm not sure what you were expecting with an animated Disney Princess flick. My wife & I were singing the music the rest of the day. Moana had (for what its worth)likely the best song ever sung by The Rock, and he didn't sound half bad. Ms. Cravalho, as Moana, was excellent & has a beautiful voice...move over Elsa & Anna, make room for Moana! The animation was gorgeous, the writing was cute & amusing, the plot was entertaining enough, it's hard to find much to complain about. I'd give it a 10 except it wasn't scary enough for me as I love scares but hey, it was a Disney Princess movie for gosh sake! :)",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Typical disney,"Here's the same Disney story we've seen time and time again. It's another profit for Disney executives to take home. Story was meh, the crab scene was more bizarre than scenes from Alice in wonderland. That being said I don't think these characters are anything that stand out in the Disney world. The effects and scenery saved what it could of this movie. I rank it high for the detail added to the tattoos of the characters. As a man covered in them, I appreciate the detail to the customs their tattoos stand for. Otherwise, try again Disney.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Moana: Disney plays the same note, the good one","Firstly Moana will be incredibly popular. It's a tried and tested format of young prince/ princess finding themselves in the real world, as well as the characters, trials and tribulations that come with that (Tangled anyone?). The premise is simple, Moana, a young soon to be tribal leader of her people, feels the sea drawing her into an adventure which will ultimately save her people.Based in the beautiful south pacific, the production does it justice with awe inspiring scenery and settings. The script follows a very Disney fan familiar route however it has proved timeless, inspiring and feel good for parents and children.Like Frozen the main character Moana is joined by an unusual sidekick, as a snowman would like melt in the climate, a simple chicken substitutes. For adults, the bizarreness of it all made for some humour, however by the end I was wondering if it was morally questionable to be laughing at a mentally challenged sidekick, despite it being a chicken.Dwayne Johnson was made for his role, not just considering his heritage, but acting as young Moana's unwilling tutor Maui, his presence captivates and dominates the screen.Very much like Frozen, Moana provides a child friendly soundtrack. However to some viewers, including myself, the headline song ""How far I'll go"" was played throughout the film. I felt the song being crammed down my throat as ""Let it go Take 2"" and despite children enjoying the experience, the feeling of forcing it on the audience was obvious to the more experienced pallet. Also another scene (involving a huge octopus) had an extremely odd ""Robbie Williams"" type song, not in keeping with the genre and to be honest the whole scene just felt odd.The final third of the film is, as already stated, inspiring and heart warming, leaving that nice fuzzy feeling that the Disney greats seem to do.Your children will love this movie, and is a must-see for the festive season. A well made production, with a reasonable script, a tried and tested format and (for the most part) an enjoyable soundtrack, this movie is very good and deserving of 8*.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Magical and Beautiful Film,"I found Moana to be absolutely mesmerizing. I said before that I went in expecting it to be just pretty good, but within the first ten minutes of watching this movie, I could tell that I was going to be wrong. The best word to describe this film is magical. The animation itself is beautiful. The colors are rich and vibrant, and you see a lot of new environments that we haven't seen in animated movies before. There are some shots in this film that took my breath away, which doesn't usually happen in an animated movie for me. It was just beautiful. And the music by Lin-Manuel Miranda is brilliant! I'm not the biggest fan of musicals, but the music in Moana worked just so damn well. It's catchy, and it really suites the film. It organically works into the movie, and they even occasionally make a couple jokes about the fact that they're singing throughout.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Awesome Funny Movie,"This movie really makes me laugh. I really like hey-hey the chicken that survives the adventure haha. I'm sure I already read a story like this where they take the plot.

Animation, comedy, action and drama, it's a complete package, recommended for all ages. Also about his movie is the love and care for your family and others. There's also a lot of moral lesson. Never give up on those trials and obstacles in life, it will make you stronger. Always remember who you are.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Moana,"Moana is Disney's latest animated film and it comes from the same creative team behind Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, Hercules, The Princess and the Frog and Treasure Planet. Moana feels like a worthy successor to Disney's most beloved animated classics while in the meantime pushing the genre into 2016, introducing a smart, diverse and convincing heroine. Plus, I don't know why but it reminds me of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker for the most part.The weight and core of the film is based on both of the main character shoulders and their chemistry. Dwayne - The Rock - Johnson charisma comes through, even just in the voice. At this point, he has proved that he is a real superstar and that he is here to stay. I love his depiction of Maui, he is sort of a sarcastic prick but still lovable because - let's be honest - it is The Rock we are talking about. Auli'i Cravalho is splendid, showing off her pipes with ""How Far I'll Go"", delivering the kind of classic Disney ""I want"" song that brings to mind The Little Mermaid's ""Part of Your World"" and Hercules' ""Go the Distance"". The music is, in my opinion, the best of their most recent films. Especially one which is destined to be the next ""Let It Go"", parents out there, be prepared, it is coming.Moreover, Moana offers us all a wave of girl power that we can ride and we love that. First, Moana will be chief after her father and nobody questions it. Second, she doesn't have a love interest, because she has an island to save. Third, her grandmother and mother are both strong presences in her life; in a perfect Bechdel Test fashion, they don't talk about men. Finally, she can do it all and keeps on fighting for what she believes in. As per usual with Disney animated films, the animation is out of this world stellar, with each passing year Disney is getting better and better at the animated photorealistic background, here especially the Ocean.Overall, Moana is a very fun and entertaining film with everything you'd want in a Disney film: great animations, good songs, good voice work, good moral core, good message and most importantly heart.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A rare Disney dumpster fire,"MoanaDisney's 56th feature length animated film, Moana, consists of gorgeous visuals, a fantastic score with fun songs and a strong female lead working to save her people. The short film, Inner Workings, was shown before the movie. That is cute, and can be seen on Disney+. Go see that one.The animation is beyond gorgeous. The colors and lights used for the ocean (arguably the real main character) are a wonder to behold. The amount of work need to animate the characters and special effects, such as Maui's tattoos, is staggering, but adding so much detail to the ""background"" is worthy of applause.I really enjoyed the music too, including the rapid fire lyrics in ""You're Welcome"", which I'll get to later. Lin-Manuel Miranda shines through yet again. Seriously, that man is a genius and I am grateful that the world gets to watch his career continue to take off.It's always wonderful to see the continued diversity and inclusion of all earth's people, not only in animated form, but with their voices as well. Moana is also not a stereotypical princess waiting for her man, but when has that stereotype actually been last seen? Even 1992's Jasmine had already broken free of that. It's not like this is groundbreaking material here, and the marketing need not mention it every single movie they make, as if begging their parents for candy at the cash register.Unfortunately that means the rest of the movie is just plain bad. It takes way too long establishing Moana's family and tribe on the island, including using the tired ""over protective parent nearly ends the world due to stubbornness brought on by fear"". Moana finally rebels to go restore the stolen heart to the goddess Te Fiti, in her possession because... the ocean... wills it? How are we to take this movie seriously when Moana has literally everything handed to her. The way the ocean behaves around her, it could have just carried her to the goddess and the movie would have been 10 seconds long. That plot hole doesn't sell merchandise, so Moana has to seek the help of a rude, self centered, egotistical waste of space named Maui. I may have liked his introductory song for its technical nature, but the arrogant message is like nails on a chalkboard. Immediately, he tries to kill her. Please tell me again why this movie is so good?The rest of the middle act of the movie drags on with unnecessary steps used to fill the time needed to keep it feature length.Finally, Disney, you should know better than to make fun of those with mental challenges. Hei Hei was such an insult to play up birth defects for cheap laughs. And then, another last minute magic wand is waves, and the mentally challenged chicken is actually responsible for saving the world.I have a passion for writing about media portrayals in both fiction and nonfiction of the human experience. I will compose long essays about how I can relate, or how I can appreciate, a good character development that journeys along with the plot. Well, there is none of that here. Moana rebelling against tradition and saving the world? Unoriginal. The way she goes about doing it? She doesn't. It's all done for her. Maui doesn't change at all, pouting that he's nothing without his hook. At least he was right about something. And Moana's father changes so fast I got whiplash. I'm sorry, but I don't recommend this film except for the pretty animation, and using Polynesian culture and mythology as inspiration. It's a bad movie.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
A masterpiece of legendary proportions.,"The first I heard of Moana was a brief appearance in Zootopia (2015). I was intrigued by the Maori/Polynesian setting and attracted to the fact that the plot was driven not by romance like most prior princess films, but rather by honor, family, and courage (and, to be honest, my own love of sailing). I was not disappointed. From the opening exposition, to the hilarious post-credit scene (see IMBB's trivia, quotes, and connections sections AFTER you watch this masterpiece) and from the use of Dead Reckoning (Reckon correctly, or you are (Sorry, aviation/maritime joke) and well-done musical numbers (Who knew The Rock could sing?!) to the near-flawless animation and references to other prominent films. Even the family- friendly swear-substitutes and subtle adult humor had the entire audience laughing.This film, along with Zootopia, Interstellar, Forrest Gump, iRobot, and Independence Day (the original one) among others, is one of my favorites, and one that is a must-see for all members of the family, regardless of age.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Unfortunately this film offers noting new and the singing is more annoying than entertaining. This film feels like it is trying to be 'Frozen', 'The Lion King', 'The Croods', 'Tangled', 'Minions' and 'Tinker Bell' (and several other animated films) all in one. The characters, however, are very bland and the plot as thin as the icing layer on a cake.There is nothing special about Moana and none of the other characters are even remotely interesting. The film lacks depth and the animation lacks detail. This is a forgettable film I'll conveniently forget I've ever watched.

It's In the Telling,"This is a very well done animated feature, using Samoan culture and mythology.

A Samoan princess is enlisted by the ocean to go on a quest to return things to the way they were. She is forced into acting against her father's wishes, going beyond the limits he has placed on her. Of course, there are no surprises in the plot. We can parse this out without any trouble. The stars of this show are the special effects, the music, and some very interesting characters. But it doesn't offer a lot of new plot developments. If we see enough Disney films, we could line up the characters that seem to appear in just about everyone. Moana is a firecracker, but her endless talk and advice gets a little old. The best characters in the film are the Ocean (yes, the Ocean) and a hilarious walleyed chicken. Don't get me wrong.

Amazing Must-See,"Moana is an intriguing and sensational Disney movie that is a must-see by everyone. It is visually appealing with breathtaking animation and is full of catchy songs that everyone will find themselves humming after seeing the movie. From the young to the old, the deep yet simple plot of Moana will appease to everyone. It is a great family movie but can also be seen and loved by even those who dislike Disney movies. Moana tells the story of an adventurous, free spirited teen that has always dreamed of sailing the ocean because of her special magic connection to it. Despite her father's pleading and risk of danger, Moana sails to find Maui, an all-powerful demigod, to embark on a captivating adventure. The movie includes popular stars such as Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson playing Maui, and Lin-Manuel Miranda writing the well-known songs from the movie.The plot of Moana is quite different than other Disney princess movies, and some may see that as a weakness, especially the lack of love interest in the movie. But this contrast to other Disney movies is what makes it so remarkable. Moana breaks the stereotype of Disney princesses which shows that they have to have perfect barbie bodies and need to depend on a man to come save them. It shows Moana as an independent young girl who only cares about pursuing her life dreams and not about what other people think of her. This a great role model for young girls to look up to and is one of the many things that makes Moana such a phenomenal movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
You wanna see Moana!,"Everything about this film is incredible and enchanting in a very refreshing way. Instant classic and must see! The cinematography and CGI's are nothing short of stunning. You will honestly be mesmerized minute by minute as much as you will laugh at the truly humorous parts and there are quite a few of them!I won't give it away, but honestly the attention to detail and brilliance won my heart completely.Dwayne The Rock Johnson is dynamic and just showcased yet another side to him that we will not forget, but will hold him adoringly in our hearts. Like Olaf gave Frozen its lustre and comedic relief....Maui stole the scenes with his electric personality and contagious and lively presence.What can I say....you're welcome!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Quite weak despite an excellent animation,"Quite weak despite an excellent animation.This movie would have been an opportunity to set a monument for the remarkable polynesian expansion over vast areas of the Pacific. Pre-columbian and pre-Portuguese, no sextants etc. and indeed a stellar achievement of sailing and navigation. This context somehow is almost completely lost in this lame story, reduced to a fairy tale set in the South Seas without much local atmosphere in terms of narration. Just using an outrigger canoe as major focus in this animation is not enough. Also the soliciting topic of the search of the unknown remains mostly unused in this movie in fact. A wasted opportunity.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
This movie was most excellent!,"This movie was really enjoyable. The songs were well written and helped paint the pictures of the movie so well. I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good movie to watch with their families. The actors that they chose to voice the characters were well thought out. The amount of hard work that has been put into this was really good.All in all, I was rally happy with how this movie turned out. I was not expecting such a great movie.

Stunningly beautiful,"Like much Disney animation, it's plagued with forgettable (very un-polynesian) songs I could have done without (with the singular exception of a very-listenable tip of the hat to David Bowie).And the story isn't the strongest - deriving from past Disney and more than a little Miyazaki (which isn't necessarily a bad thing...)But visually, this movie is breathtaking, perhaps in league with Bambi. There are some points where the motion study is so natural and fluid you ALMOST forget you're watching animation, truly ""the illusion of life"". And despite its non-western mythology and absence of white folk, I think old Uncle Walt would have approved.Disney uses Pixar technology, and they've got skin and hair and smoke and clouds nailed. Still some problems with water and especially fire. Textures are looking very natural, the tropical colors clean and saturated.Oh, and there are some points where the motion study is so natural and fluid you ALMOST forget you're watching animation.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Better Than Expected,It made me cry more than once. A great inspirational movie for girls. This movie didn't look very good before I had seen it.

Disney does it again. Brilliant.,"I am amazed reading other people's reviews who say this movie is anything but amazing.

I however found this movie more than entertaining. My 2 year old loves it.

"A lot of songs, few plot and characters","The purpose of this review isn't to criticize too much the movie or to say why it's bad, but to warn about some things that others like me may have issues with. The movie indeed was technically great with a nice animation and design, it had a funny humor and a ok plot, so I can understand why it can be appreciated. However if you don't like to have a character singing every five minutes probably you will find yourself bored in a while. Also if you were expecting a bit more than a simple and functional plot for children (like the ones of Pixar movies) again you can have issues. Especially when almost all the important turns of it are solved through a song. And also the conclusion was bad to me, in particular the way in which the conflict with the villain was closed was pretty underwhelming. As far as characters the only one that has a little depth is Maui, while the others are quite forgettable.Though the problems described are there to see, they can be totally fine for some. The animation, the colors, the catchy songs and the simple plot can be totally enough to like this one and if you are expecting something along these lines you absolutely won't be disappointed. If however you know that the described things are issues for you, well I wouldn't suggest you to check Moana. Being the same studio I was expecting something in the range of Zootropolis (that I really liked) or Raya and the last dragon (that was fine), but it was not the case. Instead I was unfortunately bored and I hope this review can save someone that identified in what I wrote.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Twizard Rating: 92,"In recent years it seems like digital animation is becoming more and more advanced with each movie being released. But the changes are gradual and often expected. We talk about how the scenery looks just like a photograph, or how animals look like they could be real. However, actual humanity is the one thing that seems to be taking the longest to become lifelike. This is where Moana comes in.While still maintaining that cartoon-like feel, this is the first time where actual human characters' emotions look real. In the past, expressions take on very on-the-nose clichés. Not necessarily over-the-top, but just very obvious. Here, we get facial expressions that look just like yours and mine. It's eerie. It helps us feel for the characters more--especially when it comes to our title character.Moana (voiced by Auli'i Cravalho) is a teenager growing up on the Polynesian island of Motunui and longs to explore the ocean. However, her father, Chief Tui, forbids her to leave. The one rule they have on the island is that they cannot go beyond the reef. But Moana is stubborn. Even as the island's resources are running out, she resiliently tries to persuade her father, but to no avail.Her grandmother gives her a small magical stone known as the heart of the goddess Te Fiti. A thousand years prior, demigod, Maui (Dwayne Johnson), stole the heart, which is causing each island, one by one, to dry up. Moana sets out to find Maui so he can return the heart to the goddess.Disney churns out a solid formula piece with Moana. This is a criticism in some respect. But it can also work to its advantage. The general storyline doesn't really give us any sort of new beats. A girl sets off to do something that we all know she will probably end up accomplishing. We foresee each false victory before it occurs. It starts out predictable and pulls from countless of its Disney predecessors. But it does one thing that's very unusual for a Disney film--it lacks romance of any kind. The two protagonists--of opposite sex--have a strictly platonic relationship. Love isn't the point of the film at all. It's so ingrained in our expectations that it catches us off guard and we are constantly reminding ourselves that the movie isn't about that.Moana is a captivating protagonist. Whether or not the writing makes her that way. The animation is just that good. There is one musical sequence where they backdrop the characters against a relatively primitive animated background, which has become an ordinary device used in countless films before. But upon looking at the canvas, it almost seems like it has been thrown into a live-action film. In past instances, there wasn't as much of a discrepancy, but now the juxtaposition shows just how far we've come with animation.I could gush for paragraphs about the visuals of this movie. But that would only end up overshadowing the film's other strength--its music.Lin-Manuel Miranda writes some brilliantly catchy songs--perhaps the best, pound-for-pound, in recent Disney musical history. From the refreshingly bright islandy ""Where You Are"" to the macabre Bowie-inspired ""Shiny"", each track hits hard and becomes addicting. All except for Maui's solo piece, ""You're Welcome."" It's Dwayne Johnson's only song and is marginal at best. The others are creative and take melodic turns that you never expect, but this one falls into the basic realm of uninspired, perhaps best appreciated by your toddler child. It merely goes through the motions, and only appears worse amidst its brilliant companions.The songs may be fantastic, but the dialogue is curiously weak, and unfortunately separates Moana from the past Disney bunch. At times it feels like it was written by a teenager--or perhaps someone who wanted to sound like one. The comedy gets childish in a couple of instances, though, to its credit, quickly snaps back. Then there's Maui's character, who can grate on you a bit. His shtick is a little too colloquial and his jokes often fall flat.But the film heads in the right direction overall. Often times going one step back and two steps forward. It nicely sticks to its narrative with Moana's perspective, and never seems to be challenged by it.The story could have been merely a device to flex its aesthetic guns (it's not), but it would have all been worth it just to experience the beauty of what's on screen. Here, the movie isn't just telling a story, but creating a full experience--something unexpectedly rare these days.Twizard Rating: 92",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Moana,"Moana is another Disney classic. The movie was just not great, but the music was great as well. Moana was one of those movies where you just don't want it to end, but when it does it end you will be speechless. I saw this movie twice the first time I saw it I saw it in 3D and it was some of the best 3D I have ever seen in a animated movie then the second time I saw it in 2D and it was still great.Parents this is a Disney movie so I don't see anything wrong with this because Disney is just pure amazing. The film was so good that I want to see it a third and forth time.

Beyond Expectation,"Such a masterpiece! Had long expected to see this movie, viewed several trailers, I thought this was going to be about how awesome a demigod would look like(personally I think it would be interesting) by fighting around monsters and saving the world.But Moana is not just about heart-beating awesomeness(though this is definitely one of the reasons why you must see the movie!), and massive visual effects. When Moana explores the sea, she is also exploring her long-living dream! The music sung by heart, with her soul beyond that endless ocean... Since the beginning of the movie, your heart is grasped, your breath is taken away, you forget who you are, why you are here--But you are here, together with the child, exploring both of your dreams--To make your dream come true! An adventure is never enough, without knowing why you are on this adventure and why you must be. Every minute I watched the movie, I was getting inspired and moved, how beautiful a movie Moana was!

Moana ShowMeTheMovies Review,"Disney's new animated presentation from the creator's of Frozen had a great deal to live up to - and surpassed every expectation.Many of Disney's past animated films with musical aspects have always often irritated me in different ways - I never thought Tangled was great, and Frozen was simply obnoxious to watch. I'm very much aware that my opinion is much against the tide of the rest of the world, particularly with Frozen and its ridiculously famous Let it Go leading track, which I didn't even consider enjoyable either.Considering the opinion that I hold on animated Disney (except Pixar, they are exceptional 80% of the time) I thought that Moana would sit as a 5/10 at best, considering Disney are very talented at sticking to a formula that makes money: but I couldn't have been more wrong. Naturally, Moana certainly does fit into this same formula, and it certainly will have made a very sizeable profit, but despite this the film was incredibly enjoyable regardless.The overall plot is quite typical of any animated kid's movie as a whole, Moana (Auli'i Cravalho) is a girl who lives on an ancient island which is becoming affected by a curse - fish begin to die, villagers start worrying about food etc - and Moana believes that the solution to her problems lies beyond the reef, away from her island, where no one has allegedly been before. Her father is the chief of the tribe that reside on the island, and wants Moana to take his place when she is of age, so he is very much opposed to the idea of her travelling away from the island.This all lines up to the generic overbearing-parent/adventurous-child dynamic, where Moana longs to travel, and her father is desperate to keep her restricted to the island during the entirety of her childhood. This isn't exactly pushing the boat out (I'm funny) when it comes to an original plot, and when Moana eventually leaves the island with the encouragement of her Grandmother, the real adventure begins.What is absolutely worth mentioning is the music, since How Far I'll Go was nominated for a Golden Globe (and likely will be for an Oscar) for best original song. While La La Land took the award, this track deserved its spot on the nominees list at least, as this is a Disney song which is not only listenable, but enjoyable and - and this is important - leagues above Let it Go. It's clear the creators of Moana understood that this song would really be a hit, since they reprise the song two or three times more during the film, which does make it a bit stale by the end - but Cravalho's voice seems perfect for not only voice acting as Moana, but also in performing How Far I'll Go.There are other original tracks in the film, Maui (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) does perform as well, but none of them resonated as much as the main track. However, other than the song that he performs, Maui was absolutely my favourite character in the film. This is far and away Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson's best presentation in any film, playing a demi-god who has caused the curse that Moana's island is affected by, mainly through his own ignorance. And that's what Maui is during the time you meet the character; an ignorant, self-absorbed moron who is too focused on his own image to actually help anyone using the status he possesses as a demi-god. Moana attempts to find him to try and fix the curse, and Maui is our reluctant hero in this adventure.What I really loved about Maui is that there is absolutely no reason for him to be so full of himself, he is stripped of his shapeshifting abilities when Moana discovers him, and he has essentially caused all of the problems that he and Moana face during the film, yet his ego is still huge, and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson's execution makes this somewhat charming. The relationship that Moana has with him is naturally quite rocky (I'm very funny) to begin with; Moana tries to command Maui to fix the curse and Maui tries to leave Moana to rot on an island and steals her boat. Despite this, they do work together during the film and their relationship grows to a point of admiration and empathy of one another - without spoiling anything. The actors clearly work in conjunction very well, and Maui was one of the main reasons I really enjoyed this movie.Overall, Moana is incredibly enjoyable, even if it follows the typical Disney formula. The plot may have been particularly generic, but every performance in the film really hit a high note and the animation style, while Disney's usual, still had moments of spectacle. Even for a children's movie, I would wholeheartedly recommend this film to any child or adult, because either demographic will likely find this film really entertaining.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
I will only say: It is true Walt Disney movie,"I don't know about the rest of people writing reviews here, but I am older generation of ""kids"" :) I remember when Disney was at his prime, and their movies ware fun, entertaining, full of joy and good singalong songs. For a long time, Disney was not that...new-generation directors, storytellers, cartoon artists and many others lost touch with old traditional good movies. They experimented with different styles of telling stories, but there was not successful in that, and Disney lost that charm that it had. This movie returned me my young self, with all the songs, breathtaking and funny moments. You go through roller-coaster of emotions from beginning to the end of movie, and it is so perfectly composed into one great unity.I agree, there ware some songs and tones of movie that ware kinda out of place, but you ""survive"" it, and already in next scene, you forgot about it, and you can enjoy in new incredible views that this movie provides.When I first heard of main casting, I was a little skeptical of ""The Rock"" Dwayne Johnson, because, I was under the impression that Hollywood is pushing him into a lot of movies, just to earn more money, and this was one of them. BUT, although he is GREAT actor (proven him self a lot of times), he was PERFECT for this part. He is ""Maui"", he was so merged with that character, you can envision him in movie.As for the technical aspect of animation, there can only be words of praise and great-job-done! Water, hair, colors, hand-body and rest of movement ware so good done, that it could be said it is lifelike.All in all, I love that Disney decided to return to it's roots, and brought us warm-cliché-loving movies that we all appreciate and need. There are new generation kids that need this kind of movies, because, we are drowning in too much reality shows, dramas, tragedy's and shallow-minded ""comedies"". For me, a great movie is the one that is re-watchable again and again, and whenever it comes to TV, you sit and watch it again, and not the movies that after once watched, you never come back and watch it again. This one goes to RE-WATCHABLE category. Thank you Disney.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Good Stuff,"Disney's newest incarnation of the Disney Princess brand, comes chalked full of Disney whimsy, high-quality Disney grade animation, all set to memorable Disney songs and time-tested Disney formula. Did I mention Moana is a Disney movie? The thing about Disney though is you can't argue with its results. They know what their doing and even when they prove the most craven to make a buck, we still absolutely love them for it. I love them!And I also love Moana, an original story based on ancient Polynesian legends and folklore. The movie tells the tale of a youthful chieftain's daughter (Cravalho) who goes on a glorious adventure; aided by an unwilling Demigod named Maui (Johnson). Seems before the time of humans, Maui stole an artifact from the God, Te Fiti and after losing it in glorious battle, the islands of the South Pacific are cursed. A millenia later, the curse has spread to Moana's island where she and her village squabble over what to do. Her father, an isolationist- type simply wants to grow coconut groves on another part of the island. Moana on the other hand believes the legends of Maui and his magical fishhook, and casts off to return the artifact to Te Fiti.As with quite a few films marking Disney's ought-10 renaissance, Moana liberally tailors itself to a well-worn formula with a 21st century twist that would seem aggressive, if not for the fact that the film is a Disney cartoon. In Moana's case, our protagonist is a strong independent woman who goes on a perilous adventure with an animal sidekick but she doesn't fall in love or find herself needing to be rescued. This is despite that fact that she is wayfinding with literally the only guy on the open ocean for thousands of miles and the man is a muscular, heroic Demigod.The difference here however is nearly nothing she does is a result of, nor contrary to, the limitations of traditional gender roles. She is (of course) forbidden to venture beyond the reef of her island by her father, but not because she's a dainty, pretty thing that needs to be protected. No, it's because no one is allowed outside the reef. Maui, at first finds her useless but not because of her gender but rather because she's a product of generations of Polynesians who never sailed before. Finally when she proves herself capable of everything we need a hero in this story to be, none of it feels like a fissure in the fabric of a society. The gender politics of Moana are a big deal precisely because none of it is a big deal.This in addition to being a well researched, respectable, if Disney- fied travelogue on Polynesian culture puts this flick above the mark as far as decent family-oriented fare. The music, while not as memorable as Frozen (2015), still has an undeniable crackle. Think Lin-Manuel Miranda's ""In the Heights"" soundtrack partially sung in Tokelauan and you get an idea on how textured, fun and witty the songs can be.Moana is fun, Moana is scrappy, Moana is...well, Moana, for all it's pleasures is still guided by the exact same hero's journey story structures that have defined animated movies for well over a generation. Does that make the film bad; of course not. But when it gets painfully obvious the film is filling for time, the obvious structure prevents the film from truly being great.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Not as good as classic Disney animation, but it is a very well made and entertaining film.","'MOANA': Four Stars (Out of Five)Disney's 56th animated feature is this computer-animated fantasy film, starring the voice talent of Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson. The film tells the story of an ancient Polynesian tribe, that's suffering the damage of a horrible curse, when the Chieftain's teenage daughter sets out to end it. She seeks the help of a demigod named Maui, who also caused the curse. The film also features the voices of Auli'i Cravalho (a debut actress, who was cast at the age of just 14), Alan Tudyk, Jemaine Clement, Temuera Morrison, Nicole Scherzinger and Rachel House. It was directed by Ron Clements, John Musker, Don Hall and Chris Williams (Clements and Musker previously co-directed other Disney animated hits, like 'THE LITTLE MERMAID', 'ALADDIN', 'HERCULES' and 'THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG', and Hall and Williams previously co-directed Disney's 'BIG HERO 6'). It was written by Jared Bush, Pamela Ribon and Aaron and Jordan Kandell; along with Clements, Musker, Hall and Williams. The film has been a huge hit at the Box Office, and it's also done impressively well with critics. I enjoyed it.Moana (Johnson) is the daughter of the chief (Morrison) of a Polynesian tribe, on an island of fisherman. When the fish vanish, due to a curse caused by a demigod named Maui (Johnson), Moana sets out to stop it. She finds the arrogant demigod who caused the curse, and demands he help her. Maui reluctantly agrees and the two go an adventuresome journey together; with the mystical help of the ocean itself. The story is loosely based on Polynesian mythology.The film is beautifully animated and quite colorful. The characters are all likable, and there's even some touching emotional depth (especially towards the end of the movie). Johnson is perfectly cast, and ​ Cravalho does a pretty impressive job as well (for such a young debut actress). There's even a nice message about respecting all life in there, including animals (and not eating them). It's not as good as classic Disney animation, but it is a very well made and entertaining film.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/193849869",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Gorgeously designed, Tepidly Written","Moana captures all the best of Disney's classic formula. However, that formula is still a formula, which means it will lose some luster the more it's implemented. Moana's big, Broadway-esque songs fit the world perfectly, yet pale in comparison to the likes of Frozen or writer Miranda's Hamilton. It's funny, though not their funniest, too often relying on comedy tropes (anachronistic references, silly side characters). However, it's still worthy of Walt's vault because of its boisterous adventure, engaging characters, & unique themes. Moana is the heir-apparent-chief of her Polynesian tribe when the ocean chooses her to find a legendary demi-god, restore balance to the world and save her island. Through many plot contrivances and conveniences (hey, what do you expect? It's a Disney fantasy), Moana and her crew learn that there is more to this fable than they expected. While that story is formulaic, the characters are a blast. Johnson is perfect as Maui, and the chemistry between he and Moana is wonderful; like lovingly bickering siblings. Even the ubiquitous, dim-witted animal sidekick (chicken Heihei) was funny enough to tamper my cynicismor maybe my 3-year-old's endless laughter softened me. The real standout here is the animation. Spectacularly beautiful, the attention to little details like the movement of sand and water make the cool character designs and action sequences that much more involving. That aesthetic charm, mixed with tons of fun and a message that believing in others is just as vital as belief in ourselves, pushes this family-fantasy beyond its admitted clichés. Fans of Mickey's movies, specifically the ones of late, will find plenty to enjoy here.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

The Princess and the Sea,"(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5)  THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.   IN BRIEF: A predictable but lively animated feature with superb visuals  that follow its winning formula all too safely.  GRADE: B  SYNOPSIS: A new Disney Princess arrives to tell her story of self  discovery.  JIM'S REVIEW: Moana, Disney's latest animated offering is more of the  same: lovely visuals, predictable but uplifting story, a peppy music  score, and a heroine you can certainly root for. The formula may be  winning, but, in all honesty, it is a little weary. Now, girl power is  a good thing...don't get me wrong...I just want a little more from this  creative studio. (My expectations are high from their track record.)  Still, this film is entertaining to the max, and the artistry and  creativity involved help to elevate this tale from standard family  fare.   Yes, the Disney Studio knows its way to success. It follows a set  formula that has worked for years: Introduce a modern day princess.  Check. Add feel-god vibes. Check. Bring in a comic sidekick. Check.  Show journey of self-discovery though impressive animation. Check. Mix  in a colorful villain or two. Check. Don't forget some catchy tunes.  Check. All leading to the ultimate happy ending. Well, what do you  think?  The screenplay, by Jared Bush, goes like this: A curse has befallen the  island of Motunui, and Moana, the chief's daughter, is determined to  rectify the ecological imbalance. So she sails off to find a demigod  named Maui to help her. Together they join forces to make the world a  better place. The script refuses to dumb down its plot, but it doesn't  stimulate the mind in its basic conventional set-up. The end result is  a purely visceral movie-going experience due to the high caliber of  artistic excellence on view.   Moana is a visual delight. The computer generated and hand drawn  animation mix well. The details are impressive: Water has a transparent  shimmer; colors glow with an iridescent radiance, varying textures from  sand to wood to leafy vegetation impress, the characters have an  expressive stylized purity. Particularly engaging are Maui's inky  hieroglyphic tattoos that spring to life to tell their own stories.  Special kudos go out to a terrific music score by Mark Mancina that has  the right percussion rhythms of the Polynesian culture and nifty  original songs with clever lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda and Opetaia  Foa'i that advance the plot.  Along with Dwayne Johnson as the Polynesian demigod, Auli'i Cravalho  voices Moana and they both do some wonderful vocal contributions to the  film. Providing fine vocal support too are Rachel House, Temuera  Morrison, and especially Jermaine Clement, who nearly steals the film  with his show-stopping production number, Shiny, (although the inspired  connection to The Little Mermaid is too obvious). There is also comic  relief in the form of a dim-witted rooster named Helhel, that younger  moviegoers will love.  Moana remains a well-crafted project, beautifully rendered and well  received by both critics and audience members. It is solidly directed  by Ron Clements and John Musker. But the predictability factor does  impair this South Pacific tale and all the wonderful surface treatment  and artistry could not hide its simplistic and familiar narrative. A  feeling of ""been there / done that"" does seep into the film's overall  impact. (In a year of glorious entries that brought forth such classic  works like Kubo and the Two Strings and Zootopia, also by the Disney  Studio, who couldn't ask for more of that perfect level of animation  and story?)  Wanting more daring innovation in my animated features is a worthy  goal. So I still look forward to the artisans at Disney Studio and  their next venture. The talent is there, in full force, but the Mouse  Factory needs to stop playing it so safely and find more challenging  projects. Stories that surprise and whet the intellect are not that far  a reach. Call me a cockeyed optimist.  NOTE: There was a tad bit of controversy of the depiction of Maui.  Disney Studios bulked him up from his more recognizable well-toned  physique and critics cried foul of this revamped stereotypical  reincarnation. There are bigger issues in life. Nuff said.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A treat for the whole family.,"Infused with Hawaiian mythology, the latest animated flick from the Mouse House feels different despite being centred on the same girl-fulfils-heroic-destiny formula it has rolled out time and time again. Following the restless daughter of an island-bound Chieftain, this seafaring adventure is packed to the brim with goofy animal sidekicks, toe-tapping song and dance numbers, and the usual Disney charm. The whole movie is anchored by an endearing protagonist who earns a spot amongst Disney's more famous female characters thanks to her pluck and tomboyishness; there are no love interests or royal weddings for this independent woman. Moana (Auli'i Cravalho) doesn't do all the heavy lifting though, spending a large portion of the runtime with Maui (Dwayne Johnson – charismatic as ever), a hilariously egotistical demi-god who can shape shift and hurl insults. The chemistry between Moana and Maui is fantastic, their witty banter and odd couple clashing plays both for big laughs—a sailing lesson with a paralysed Maui is downright hilarious—and for touching moments. Not everything lands perfectly though, with Jemaine Clement's nefarious crab Tamatoa not quite landing, the sneering and sarcastic crustacean a little too reminiscent of Clement's diabolical cockatoo Nigel in the Rio series. The climactic showdown against a gigantic lava-throwing demon boasts some impressive visuals, however it also feels inessential coming off the back of what was otherwise a subtler affair. But the film works up so much goodwill elsewhere a few missteps can be easily forgiven. Disney delivers yet another family treat that can be enjoyed by those of all ages.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Will the animated film become a victim of its own success?,"The quality of some of the animation in Moana is phenomenal.We already know animated/CGI film has come on in leaps and bounds ever since Disney's 'Beauty and the Beast' (1991) but in Moana it looks so real.If this continues, will animation and live-action film become indistinguishable?We have a little while left until or if that happens so can enjoy the vibrant, amusing fantasies that studios such as Disney continue to produce with what seems such easy excellence.The Rock, Dwayne Johnson, was the only man big enough in real-life to portray a (apparently) huge demigod but he is bested by the relatively unknown Hawaiian singer Auli'i Cravalho in the title tole.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Beautiful World Of Magic,"""Moana"" is another animated classic by Disney Studios. The images are beautiful, including some depictions of nighttime and low light conditions that are amazing. The visuals are paired with some wonderfully stirring tribal music.The story is about a quest. Moana is the heroine who pursues her dreams and her mission and, of course, finds personal fulfillment and growth as well. Played by Auli'i Cravalho, it is difficult to imagine anyone better suited to the role. Dwyane Johnson plays Maui, her reluctant helper, a demigod.From the start, the film is revealed as a mythological story. It is based on traditional Polynesian stories of creation and general principles of nature worship. The artists at Disney created a magical world of beauty and imagination that is only rivalled by ""Avatar"".",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Vibrant Journey of Self-Discovery,"""Moana"" is a visually stunning and heartwarming Disney animated film that successfully blends Polynesian mythology with a modern coming-of-age story. Directed by Ron Clements and John Musker, the film takes audiences on an epic journey across the Pacific Ocean with a young, brave heroine as its anchor.The standout feature of Moana is undoubtedly its breathtaking animation. The ocean feels alive, the islands are lush and vibrant, and the character designs are rich and expressive. The attention to detail in every frame showcases Disney's mastery of the medium. The film also boasts an incredible soundtrack, with songs by Lin-Manuel Miranda, Opetaia Foa'i, and Mark Mancina. ""How Far I'll Go"" serves as an empowering anthem, while ""You're Welcome"" adds humor and charm.Moana, voiced by Auli'i Cravalho, is a refreshing and relatable protagonist. She is strong, determined, and driven by her connection to her people and heritage. Her journey of self-discovery and leadership feels authentic and inspiring. Dwayne Johnson's portrayal of Maui, a demigod with a larger-than-life personality, adds a layer of comedic relief and depth as the unlikely mentor.Overall, Moana is a delightful animated film that appeals to both children and adults. Its vibrant visuals, memorable music, and inspiring message of self-discovery make it a standout entry in Disney's animated canon.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Classic Disney, great morale lessons","Firstly, to anyone saying the plot is simple and there is too much singing...this is Disney AND it's created primarily for children! Children don't understand nor do they want to watch a complex film. Have these people never watched CBeebies?! All Disney films are formulaic and it works for their core audience.My son loves this film. As does the rest of them family. It's uplifting, beautiful visually and teaches children a host of lessons about being true to yourself, that who you are is what you do, how wronged people can react in a manner out of character, that good people do bad things in order to be liked...it also dipects a confident, independent and brave child. All topics that sparked conversations around what these mean with my 6 year old step daughter who thought your name is who you are.I do agree that Disney does have a tendency lately to have a female hero, I would like to see a modern Disney film with a male lead, but that doesn't directly take anything away from this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beautiful and expressive with lush visuals and great music.,"One of the better Disney classics I have seen in some time. Maybe a bit much for kids under 7, but it has a lot of appeal for most ages.The characters have a lot personality and their expressive faces are really amazing. The score and songs are surprisingly catchy. What really stood out for me is the gorgeous ocean (which plays a central character), in all of its colors and moods. Idyllic beaches, clear aquamarine lagoons, Starry skies, violent waves, lightning storms and stunning luminescent scenes abound.There is an underlying mother earth wisdom which tries to surface while teaching us about early Pacific culture, mythology and their history as ocean voyagers. The main character Moana is equally wonderful as a curious toddler (utterly cute), and as the young heroin who musters the courage to carry on the destiny of her ancestors. Her Demi-God sidekick Maui is also a great character.I have had a lot of reservations with some of Disney's more recent productions, as they tend to be more trendy and less traditional, but this one manages to have progressive sensibilities while maintaining that high standard we expect.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Okay, if anybody doesn't like this film, they have no idea what they're talking about","Seriously, I saw a lot of less-than-5 star reviews on the first page of the review page. It seems that there are a lot of people that just want to try to bring the rating down because they can't stand it when a movie they hate gets all the love in the world. In the case of Moana, do not listen to said people.This is a beautiful movie and does deserve the moniker of ""Disney Classic."" It has just about all the elements of a Disney Classic: Great animation, great songs, great voice performances and a payoff that is well worth the journey.The story is about a young Polynesian girl named Moana who is the princess (again, Disney) of her island. However, where she really longs to be is on the water, even though she has been told not to go out there. However, when things start looking bleak for her island, the only thing to do is to cross the Ocean, find Maui, a demigod who stole the heart of the goddess Te Fiti, and return the heart.While there are many aspects of Disney in this movie, there are also some freshness in the movie. First off, the Polynesian feeling of it all; Disney has never had a movie in which these people were the stars, and yet here they are, and I love every minute of it. Secondly, while Moana is a princess, she is not a damsel in distress like most Disney princesses. She never gets kidnapped and is a hardworking girl who would rather get her hands dirty (or, in this case, her feet wet) than wait for a man to sweep her off her feet. All of this is very refreshing to see in a Disney film.So yes, definitely see this movie! Do not worry about the trolls that are trying to bring the rating down; this is a Disney Masterpiece, and anybody who says otherwise is only fooling themselves!Oh, and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson can sing! What's not to love?!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
best Disney movie in ages,"This is one of the most heartwarming, beautifully imagined animations in forever. The story is so vital and real, the struggles of Moana so palpable and sincere, it makes my eyes water to think about it. Another true return to form is the music (of course no doubt thanks to LMM - the one true musical genius of our time). Such a lovely and timely message about respecting the earth, and knowing when to break with traditions. It's a parable for our time, and I hope every child watches this film and takes it to heart.

The whole thing is a masterpiece. Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote a lot of the songs so it's no surprise I love the music. I love how Polynesian culture is represented. I love that the princess isn't saved by a prince and they ""live happily ever after"". It's a princess who has to be cunning and brave and work hard to save her people. These are the messages we need to send to young girls instead of the ideal that a handsome prince with rescue them one day and fix everything. Moana is my favorite Disney princess movie by a landslide.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

I am just going to moan about it,"Set on the Polynesian island of Motunui, the locals islanders worship the goddess Te Fiti who brought life to the ocean. A pounamu stone is her heart and the source of her powers. Maui, a shape-shifting demigod steals it but he subsequently loses his powers. A millennium later, Moana the daughter of Motunui's chief is the chosen one to get back the heart to Te Fiti as the island is dying. She needs to persuade vain Maui to return the heart.Maybe if I sat with an audience of younger kids I might had enjoyed this film more. As it is I found the film dull, the songs duller. I did not find it that amusing or entertaining.I noted the amount of people involved in writing the story for this film, I think any old hack in Hollywood could had knocked this out on autopilot.I did like the animation style, some of it was very creative but the Polynesian setting bought little to the table.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Nicely animated flick with catchy tunes,"I like Moana, and I rarely watch animated kids movies any more.

A cute marine adventure with 2 charismatic characters,"Quite good, this movie that only has two protagonists in a refreshingly entertaining adventure story, with good songs, original characters and a somewhat simple, but accomplished plot. The animation is what never disappoints like every Disney movie, Moana is a well-done and charismatic character, just like Maui, to whom Dwayne Johnson himself has given much of his charisma and grace. A whole journey through the ocean full of dangers and the dispute between Moana and Maui to fulfill an important mission. Moana is a very nice movie to enjoy with the family.

Pretty much a pacific Islander version of Brave,"Pretty much a pacific Islander version of Brave, only you replace the Celt with an Islander, the crazy killer grizzly with a volcano creature, the crazy witch with a crazy grandmother, and the 'overbearing'(ha ha) mother/oddball father with an overbearing father/demi-God. But, hey at least they got their basic Neo-Disney formula down(I'll give you a hint it rhymes with 'human-empowerment'). However I do find that the pig on the cover is a bit 'misleading due to the girl's grandmother having more of a role in this movie than that scared little piggy(I think they were trying to lambast the 'cute' Disney companion stereotype and just went with the chicken, but then again they did the same thing in Mulan and the 'little brother' character). But all criticism aside, this movie is viewable and relatable on almost all fronts, which makes it a great reviewable movie. Maui makes it a breath of fresh air due to his misogyny, which tends to be rejected in MOST Disney movies rather than embraced (Yeah he get's dropped down a few pegs, but hearing Moana call him a 'son of a-' makes you get the idea). Another good point is that it reaffirms a message of 'equality' vs superiority, given that Moana and Maui both contribute in the restoration of the heart(unlike Maleficent, which makes men look like total daughter kidnapping, wing-stealing, power hungry douchebags). The last point I'll make is that the movie 'empowered' women without 'overpowering' them, which is a faddish archetype seen in MANY titles that seldom makes the movie lose its charm(basically it makes us forget that the main character is a girl and portrays her just like a dude, IE Snow White in Snow White and the Huntsman and Alice in the 'New' Alice in wonderland series) a feature easily found in Mulan where they literally portrayed every male stereotype possible; good or bad (Don't get me wrong it was still funny as hell). It also avoided the hammer to the face REAL LIFE politically driven subject matter which can be seen in Zootopia(another recent Disney title, which I still enjoyed)... well unless you look at the fact that Maui was basically aborted by his parents as seen in his backstory.But all in all Moana made me laugh and my wife and kids enjoyed it(even if it is 'just another Disney movie').",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
disney as always,"Moana is another typical example of Disney in recent years in which men are either ridiculed or turns out to be evil and females take their place as the ultimate form of goodness and justice.No female character is truly evil or if she seems evil then that is a mistake and an injustice has been done to her .However, all male characters are stupid, ignorant or downright evil, even Moana's father stands in her way. Maui is ridiculed by her and that also applies to the character of the rooster who is completely brainless.The film is like one big women propaganda show in which the original legend is altered to ridicule the male aspect so that it can be replaced by women, an aspect that we often see in modern films these days.The animation is good but as always ,standard computer animation.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
just a little historical trivia,"I recently read information on this movie in regards to the historical content and commented on the 'long pause' of when the Polynesian people stopped sailing for a time. according to historians and anthropologists, it is suspected that even though they had developed the navigation practices of using the stars and currents it took time for them to develop sailing vessels that would allow them to sail against the current. this makes sense since previously it has been determined that they used the currents to sail to where they ended up in the earlier times. just thought I would share this here.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

7.5/10,"Of course it was well done as per usual. The animation was top notch. One of the most highly detailed animated films I've seen since Pixar's The Good Dinosaur. A bit of a predictability with the overall story I will admit and even felt like a typical Disney flick in some cases, but this still stands out pretty well on it's own much like previous films by Disney Animation. It is a neat theme even while it feels like it is used often. It may be like a typical Hawaiian-like feel, but it still stands out okay with not just it's lush looks, but with the unique fantasy elements within. Disney continues to know how to relate to just about any audience, including the modern era, for such a former yet classic company that still remains.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Love love love, and the songs are just so good!!","Enchanting Disney animated film that takes you on an epic adventure across the ocean, celebrating Polynesian culture and the power of self-discovery and bravery.The story is set on the island of Motunui, where Moana, a spirited and determined young girl, is destined to become the future chief. However, she is drawn to the sea, despite her father's warning that it is dangerous and forbidden.Motunui faces a crisis as its resources become scarce, and the islanders are unable to catch fish or grow crops. Moana learns from her grandmother that their ancestors were voyagers who traveled the vast ocean, but they stopped exploring due to a mythical demigod named Maui stealing the heart of Te Fiti, the island goddess. The heart's loss caused the islands to decay, and the sea became treacherous.Determined to save her people and restore the heart of Te Fiti, Moana sets sail on a daring adventure. She seeks out Maui, a self-absorbed and boastful demigod with the power to shape-shift, and convinces him to help her return the heart to Te Fiti.Their journey is filled with challenges, including encounters with dangerous creatures and Maui's struggle to find his identity beyond his supernatural abilities. Along the way, Moana discovers her true calling as a wayfinder, someone who can navigate the ocean using the stars and other natural signs.As Moana and Maui grow closer, they learn from each other and develop a deep bond of friendship. Moana helps Maui rediscover his inner hero, and Maui teaches Moana about her people's voyaging history and the importance of self-belief.In a thrilling climax, Moana faces the ultimate test of courage and determination as she confronts Te Ka, a fiery monster that guards Te Fiti's heart. Through her bravery, compassion, and the power of her ancestors, Moana succeeds in restoring the heart to Te Fiti, healing the land and the sea.Moana returns to Motunui as a changed leader, bringing with her the knowledge and spirit of her voyaging ancestors. She shows her people that they can embrace their voyaging heritage while also cherishing their home on the island.With its stunning animation, empowering messages, and captivating songs like ""How Far I'll Go"" and ""You're Welcome,"" ""Moana"" is a beautiful and inspiring film that celebrates the strength of young women and the importance of embracing one's identity and heritage.
