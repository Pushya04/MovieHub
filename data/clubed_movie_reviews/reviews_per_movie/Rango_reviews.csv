Oscar well deserved.,"The Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year went to Rango and to be honest in this category it clearly deserves that. After The Ring and Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl Gore Verbinski brings us another highly entertaining movie, this time with something slightly different as it is an animated movie. The images and characters are just perfect, it's all very creative and visually stunning. As for the actors, or better the voice-overs, they were perfect in their roles. I can't see anybody narrating Rango better than Johnny Depp. The story is simple but effective, with alot of humor, maybe not for the younger kids but more for adults with a healthy imagination and that don't mind watching animation movies every now and then. Rango, a movie I will watch again in the future.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Once Again, Listen to the Venom","Rango manages to appeal to many interests. First of all, the recreation of the old West is charming. The animators have done a masterful job of producing a setting that really works. The chameleon star finds himself in Dirt, the aforementioned town, and is given the task of saving the water supply. Yes, it is a bit dark and the plot is sophisticated. So why so many 1's and 2's. Is it that people are so easily bored when their minds are a bit challenged by an animated film? This is one of the better films of the year and works on many levels. It also parodies tough Westerns that we have seen in contemporary times.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Name's Rango,"A good animated film, I had never seen an animated western with animals before this. Johnny Depp is fantastic as always and the rest of the cast does a good job.Music is solid and whilst not up the standards of some older Western films like Good the bad and the ugly it's still quite good. I liked the actual cinematography of the film as well, how Rango and Beans stood out in almost every seen, compared to the drabness of the drabness of the town Rango is rather colourful.The plot is really interesting as well, with water being used as currency and the usual corrupt rich hoarding lots of it and not distributing it fairly. I've seen better plots but it's easy for children to follow and compelling enough for adultsAction wise I thought it was average personally but a certain serpentine character was very well designed and thoroughly intimidating.7/10: Definitely deserves a watch, especially if you're interested in classic westerns, and I think the genuinely interesting characters and animation are worth a viewing for people who like that stuff too",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great movie western...,"One of the best animated movies ever made, the trailer shows so little and I'd recommend watching it as it is absolutely outstanding. The animation work to the character development to the soundtrack are perfect in every way. Everything a animated movie should be.",,Anonymous,Animation
Jack Sparrow as a lizard,"Rango (Johnny Depp) is a hyper imaginative pet chameleon. When his family loses him out the back of their car, he is left to fend for himself in the middle of a desert. He escapes from a deadly hawk to find a western town called Dirt. The drought has made water incredibly valuable. Through luck and circumstances, Rango become the sheriff, but he is hopelessly clueless.This is a very well made Nickelodeon animated movie. I wonder if this is going to be a new competitor to the animated field. The animation looks crisp and lively. The only missing element is cuter characters. Lizards are very odd for animation especially if you do it relatively realistic. But it fits very well to the setting of an old decaying western.Rango is a very original character which actually is reminiscent of Johnny Depp's other big character Jack Sparrow. Does the fact that this is a reunion between Pirates director Gore Verbinski and Johnny Depp has anything to do with it? The comedy comes from a similar place, and it works well here as well.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The negative reviews tell you why it's good.,"Rango is a great kids' movie that plays on many levels, like all great kids' movies. About a hundred churchies here don't like it; that tells you it's realistic and morally complex. (One person complained about its metaphors for good and evil, because ""many people take God and Satan seriously"". Yeah, but we don't all think we hold a copyright on them.) And some folks helicoptered in to complain that it's violent and would scare some kids. Fifty years ago my parents took me to see Bambi and it scared me. So did Dumbo. It's vital that kids learn about fear, danger, and violence, and a cartoon is the softest place to do it. Thank God my folks understood that. For the record, Rango's violence is funny and completely unrealistic. Would it kill you to talk to your own kids about the difference between slapstick and the real world?There are ""swear words"" here, if you still think ""hell"" and ""damn"" are swear words, because it's a gritty Western. (That happens to star a chameleon.) There are a lot of Hispanic references and characters, because Hispanics invented cowboys and the ""American"" West; Nickelodeon simply decided to unwhite-ify the Hollywood version, for a change. (The guy I read who complained about that wasn't even Hispanic. Meanwhile, I have Hispanic friends who love this movie, in part because they're in it, for once)There are several stereotypes, ethnic and otherwise, because it's a satire. If you can't grasp irony, avoid this movie. In fact, never go outside. And several minor characters smoke. I hate smoking. But: stereotypes, remember? Westerns? Cultural memes? How about just teaching kids the difference between allegory and real life?As for the moral content, the ""lessons"" of Rango, which, I think I can state without incurring a spoiler slap, are: 1. the world is a crazy place, 2. scary problems have to be solved by ordinary people, and 3. a quick wit and a lot of luck sometimes beats a quick draw and a lot of money.If you agree with that, and aren't scared of your own shadow, see the movie. I loved it, and I'm hard to please. It's a great romp, a witty farce, and a lot of fun, precisely because Nickelodeon didn't sugar it down to pious drek.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Fantastic Animated Film- Destined to be a Classic,"Hilarious, surprisingly badass, and uniquely entertaining, Rango is not only a fantastic animated film, but a fantastic film itself. Johnny Depp gives a great voice performance as the titular character Rango, and even though he shines magnificently, the film also hold many fantastic voice performances from actors all around. The peculiar thing about Rango, is that it is so firmly grounded upon its own story, and not only fully embraces it, but it is fully believable, which is an insane task to feat. The film is beautifully animated, containing some of the best CGI for a film of the 2010's and beyond. It can be a wonderfully witty satire when it calls for it, and a badass western when it needs it. Rango is full of style, class, humor, rich atmosphere, and a fantastic storyline. I was entertained all the way through watching it, even when it almost clocks in at about 2 hours, and honestly will be willing to watch it again anytime. The film is written spectacularly well, and directed so as well, and is easily one of the best, if not the best, animated feature I have ever seen.

An Animated Masterpiece That Redefines the Wild West with Wit and Charm,"The animated movie Rango enthralls viewers with its breathtaking sights, deft narrative, and irreverent comedy. The movie is made funnier and more charming by Johnny Depp's chameleon character. Under the direction of Industrial Light & Magic, the animation pays respect to vintage Westerns while adding a distinctive, eccentric touch. Rango is notable for its willingness to experiment with animated storytelling by fusing humor, mystery, and adventure. The film is an immersive experience that appeals to audiences of all ages because of its brilliant use of cinematography, colorful characters, and engaging plot.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A huge risk!,"I'm not exactly sure who this film was made for but I do not care one bit. This movie was a huge risk because it isn't the most hilarious movie of all time and it's not really geared towards kids. But for me this risk paid off big time. Rich themes, breathtaking animation and character design, and great voice acting to go along with it. Rango is a fantastic film and I would watch it any day of the week.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not as good as I hoped.,"The whole movie is unnatural. There are some great parts, the voice acting is great, and the graphics are mind blowing, but it just doesn't cut it. The movie is extremely slow-paced. At times, I, and everyone else almost went to sleep. Some characters just aren't fit.The story itself, for the most part, is not engaging, and fun. In movies like these, there should be a WOW factor present, like in Kung Fu Panda for an example, but there isn't one in Rango.I didn't really like it. My friend was amazed.So, it's a lot up to the viewer. It's not something that can appeal to any viewer. But, if you have time to kill, then I guess this will do just fine.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wasn't expecting something this good so early on in the year...,"I heard from a number of people that this was excellent so I went to see it myself being a fan of animated movies and of film in general. And I absolutely loved it, other than being a little too long, which is such a minor complaint, it was a wonderful film with some surprisingly mature themes and does very well at trying something different.The animation for starters is outstanding. Not only do the characters move convincingly, but the colours look gorgeous and the backgrounds are imaginative and stunning. The soundtrack is another plus, the score is wonderful with a sense of fun, great use of instruments and nods to Ennio Morricone, without being too generic or over-the-top with some inspired musical flavour to it.The script is funny, smart and quirky as well- loved the Chinatown(Ned Beatty based his performance on that of John Huston's), Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and Star Wars references- the characters are genuine and likable with heart and don't fall into the trap of being too cliché(there are some but it works in the film's favour and I loved the title character), the film goes at a great pace while remaining wholly satisfying at its end with an almost elegiac quality that is there with almost all the best westerns, the slapstick action bounces along nicely and the story is far from formulaic instead it is original and inventive. The voice acting is wonderful, both Johnny Depp and Bill Nighy- Rattlesnake Jake is awesome!- give knockout performances, while Isla Fisher, Ned Beatty, Alfred Molina, Harry Dean Stanton and Abigail Breslin are equally terrific.In conclusion, a wonderful film that I wasn't expecting to be this good this early on in the year. On a side note, for those complaining about suitability for children, I actually wouldn't say this was a film for kids but more adult-oriented. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great animation + funny characters + bad scenario = boring movie,"The first half of this movie is OK. There is some action going, animation is nice, wild west rocks, you meet new characters and have high expectations. But, after a while, it all gets 100% predictable and boring. Basically, it transforms into standard: Good Hero fights his complexes to help Other Stupid Cowards and defeat Bad Hero. Children around you start crying, you yawn and fun ends. Well, there is still hope, so you are not leaving the movie room, expecting to have at least some fun. Time passes, you fight your boredom, Good Hero fights his personal problems, still no fun. You continue thinking about leaving, but curiosity wins and you decide to wait until the end in hope that, maybe, the movie will have not an ordinary ending... Nope, hope dies last and I'm glad I will not meet Rango again.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Existential yet goofy, ""Rango"" will impress both young and old","We all face an existential crisis at some time or another, just usually not when we're seven, which will likely be the mean age of children watching this newest non-Pixar non- DreamWorks animated feature. No, ""Rango"" won't challenge kids to contemplate their role in the cosmos, but that's precisely the predicament of its main character, a theatrical lizard who finds himself — as many animals in animated films do these days — thrust out of domestic bliss and forced to reckon with the untamed and unforgiving nature of the wild natural world. But in addition to all its verboseness and abstract homage to classic Westerns, ""Rango"" equally dishes out top-notch physical humor and creative characters for the young ones to lap up, even if they're not exactly of age to, as the film puts at least once, ""ruminate.""We don't learn much about Rango's life as a pet lizard. In fact, his name is not even Rango; he adopts it as his identity during his adventure. We do see him create his own theatre productions with the random items in his tank and he pretends that they give him feedback and criticism. When he determines that his latest show needs some intense conflict, he finds himself flung from his tank and on the side of the dry desert road. At the advice of an old armadillo (Molina), he seeks out water and stumbles upon the town of Dirt, a classic Wild West locale full or critters and experiencing a nasty drought.Johnny Depp quickly loses himself into Rango, a character that's somewhere between his take on Willy Wonka and his turn as Hunter S. Thompson. Depp churns out an outstanding animated protagonist, one who is equal parts boisterous and insecure. As the ultimate outsider in Dirt, our lizard hero has an epiphany: he can reinvent himself out here. He takes up his new name and makes up a fantastical tall tale and then with a pinch of luck, becomes the toast of the town and gets anointed sheriff. All seems swell, but something's up in the town with regards to the dwindling water supply and the local critters are getting restless. Rango must truly be the hero he masquerades as.The creatures of Dirt are fascinatingly animated. They are gritty and unpleasant looking, but awing in their detail. Rango's facial expressions even out-Depp the man behind them as embodied in the scrawny asymmetrical lizard. The animators do a particularly fine job of creating the hot and dry climate of the desert, enough so to recommend that the film is best enjoyed with a beverage in hand. It's so effective that it magnifies the problematic nature of this simple predicament done hundreds of times before. Hidden underneath it all somewhere has to be an environmental message, but not an overt one and not the main lesson to learn from the story.The language and texture of the film might be decidedly adult, but the conventions of the story and the degree of action aims specifically for children. Rather than aim for a middle ground, ""Rango"" somehow takes the highest road and the lowest road simultaneously. The dialogue and the situations are sophisticated but the physicality of the characters and the high-flying Western frontier action still plays to a child's understanding. This only proves that ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" director Gore Verbinski has a real gift for all-ages entertainment.In addition to Rango's existential quandary, children will not understand the cinematic homages either, particularly to spaghetti Westerns. One of the film's most affecting scenes comes at the moment when our animated hero, as they all do, hits the lowest of lows after he's exposed as a ""fraud."" Rango has a run-in with ""The Spirit of the West,"" an instantly recognizable figure who has some old-fashioned advice about toughness and walking tall on the path you're given. It's a tender moment as what has been considered a bygone era of cinema plays an important thematic role in such a modern mainstream story.""Rango"" doesn't quite capture the degree of humor and emotional depth that the Pixar greats of the last few years have, but it's a fun adventure with exquisite animation, tasteful characters and a good heart, which puts it as an above-average offering compared to others of its kind. Adults will simply marvel at the intellectual boldness of this pure and simple kids movie and rightfully so. Only with a Pixar gold standard in place does ""Rango"" come across as flawed; otherwise it's an absolutely pleasant watch from start to finish.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Great looking, decent story, but could stand to be funnier","Worth seeing mostly for the visuals. It's awesome how bizarre these characters are. I sincerely hope they frighten children (reports from the movie's message board say that there were a lot of young children weeping when the rattlesnake character appears). Animated films are often far too cutesy, and this is a breath of fresh air in that way. The story is not especially great, but it's passable. It's a Western about a pet chameleon (voiced (kind of poorly) by Johnny Depp) who gets lost in the Mojave and ends up in a small town. After some accidental heroics, he becomes sheriff. A local lizard girl (voiced (quite well) by Isla Fisher) persuades him to look into the current drought after she finds evidence of water being dumped in the middle of the desert. If that sounds familiar, it's because that whole mystery plot is cribbed from Chinatown. That doesn't bother me at all, and the mystery is relatively complex for a kid's movie. My major complaint about Rango is that the humor very rarely works. The script is just not very funny. If it wasn't supposed to be, that would be fine, but they're clearly going for laughs (and failing).",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Awesome,"I mean... wow.*insert slow clap for ILM folks*Last night my wife and I had the pleasure of checking out an early screening of Rango here in the twin cities. It was a blast! This movie was a great deal of fun. The jokes all hit the right marks, the story was solid, sweet and not too formulaic, and the visuals were outstanding.There were times that this movie looked 100 percent photo real. outstanding job modeling and texturing and lighting on this. the little tiny attention to detail in the world you guys built had my wife and I in awe throughout most the movie. The animation was fun and eccentric. Over the top but at times subtle and felt meaningful. The only little nit pick was the mouths on some of the characters. in the attempt to make the animals look more like the animals they were representing the mouths were quite small and at times the sync was a bit odd. Though it provided for some goofy looking characters that were fun.at just over an hour and a half, at times it felt it was a little too slow paced. well, that was my wife's critique. I looked at it more so that they were going for the slower feel of some classic westerns. I thought the long stretches of little dialog, epic music and visuals, and great cinematography worked in the films favor.The crowd dug it too. I think the youngest person in the theater was about 6 (which i found odd for a late night screening, but whatever) and the oldest was probably in their 70's and everyone was engaged.I was kind of surprised what they could get away with in a PG rated movie. Im no prude or anything, but there were enough adult jokes snuck in there to give me the giggle fits. Couple of lite swear words, references to more... ehem, adult type themes, but overall pretty tame and enjoyable.Hats off. If this doesn't win awards I don't know what I believe in anymore. This is one of the more entertaining movies I have seen in a long time.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Zany, trippy, bizarre, unique, and perplexing. But it totally works.","After an extremely weak first quarter in the cinematic world full of remakes, re-dos, 3-D flicks and movies about gnomes (reallyreally?) we finally have something fresh, original, and quite trippy to kickoff 2011. Once again reaching into his Western roots, Gore Verbinski makes up for what he did to World's End and delivers one heck of an animated film. Rango is full of surprises: surprisingly violent, surprisingly smart, surprisingly full of western references left and right, and with a surprisingly incredible western score that matches that of Ennio Morricone (never thought I'd say that). If you can muster its sluggish start, extremely fast-pace humor and rather bizarre moments throughout, then you will thoroughly enjoy Rango and its Western mayhem. And who said the Western genre is dead....Rango (Johnny Depp) is a chameleon that after a mishap inside his tank comes across a town full of desperation and hopelessness. With a little bit of luck and a lot of lying, Rango becomes sheriff of the town but runs into a lot of trouble when the water supply hits low and tensions start rising. The storyline is nothing new, but the script (Good work John Logan) is full of fresh ideas, fun action pieces, and a great assortment of characters. In the midst of the script lie so many homages and references to classic westerns you can make up one heck of a drinking game.A strong factor into the fun of Rango is the excellent voice acting, which rivals that of Pixar's best casting work (See: The Incredibles and Finding Nemo). Johnny Depp is phenomenal in all his crazy roles, and his performance of the hilarious Rango is nothing short of brilliant. But, let's not forget the great work of Isla Fischer (as the lead female), Bill Nighy (as the sinister Rattlesnake Jake), and the great singing of the owl mariachi (Los Lobos). And speaking of singing, let's talk about music. Hans Zimmer was robbed when Inception didn't win Original Score, but he deserves even more praise with the score here. It is an incredible mix of guitar, strings, orchestra, and nods to masterful Morricone, and is hands-down the best score since Michael Giacchino's ""Up."" I am strongly contemplating buying the soundtrack if it's out in stores.The three main reasons why Rango works: Johnny Depp, Hans Zimmer, and Gore Verbinski. Very few blockbuster directors have the zaniness and range of Verbinski; as his repertoire includes Pirates of the Caribbean (epic blockbuster), The Ring (horror), The Mexican (I still don't know...) and Mousehunt (underrated dark family comedy). His talents can be shown here as he interweaves strange dream sequences with unique action sequences and plenty of hilarious moments. This movie also doesn't hold back for the kiddies, as it has the language, adult dark humor, strong themes, and heavy violence of a good-ol' western. Just picture what were to happen if Chuck Jones directed a tamed Quentin Tarantino script. And Lord knows there is not enough Chuck Jones influence in the modern animated movie world.Bottom Line: Rango works because of its fresh originality and its refusal to follow the clichéd rules of children animated flicks. It ditched the 3-D, ditched the watered-down tone we see all too much, while we experience a very unique take on Westerns while at the same time see plenty of odes and homages to them. The zany edge of classic Warner Brothers doesn't happen enough in this millennium (With Emperor's New Groove being the outstanding example) so its great whenever we see a Chuck Jones-style of entertainment. While the movie is quite gritty for a PG flick and some of its off-color content may throw you off, I am confident when I say that Rango is the first good flick of 2011. Once again Depp, great job. Your career is astounding and even underrated in critical acclaim standards. Zimmer, I think its time to start making an Oscar dedicated to you, because that was quite a musical trip. And Verbinski, I forgive you for World's End.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fun all the way...Johnny Depp as rango is great...,"Rango is filled with funny and slapstick moments.But it also has some real serious sequences. This is the surprising element that should not work and still it does..The film stars a chameleon (Johnny Depp), who thinks he's an actor, going through an existential crisis, as he has lived his whole life in a terrarium. When that life is quickly—and literally—shattered, he finds himself walking in search of water. Instead, he finds a town called Dirt, where all the residents are plagued by outlaws and a severe lack of water, which is used as currency, it's so rare. Rango, seeking acceptance, assumes the role of sheriff, a role that has been played before, but with more unfortunate results. To make matters worse, someone is dumping water in the desert and draining all of dirt's resources. Rango is now in no-man's land and must escape from a Hawk who wants him FOR A MEAL! Tons of action awaits the viewer. Who could it be, what is their diabolical plan, and is Rango really the unlikely hero of his own story?In case it wasn't obvious enough from this summary, the film's tone is surreal, complex and almost shockingly mature for an animated picture. It blends in so very many movie references, blending the gritty, revisionist western with the surrealism of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, a too-obvious comparison on the latter's part. Director Gore Verbinski had a unique way of producing and directing this picture: he gathered Depp and all the other actors on a sound stage, in various costumes, acting out their scenes, as a sort of visual reference. Depp affectionately—and appropriately—called this 'Emotion capture,' as it gives the movie a more natural, organic feel, as if the reactions were believable. When it's put on screen, it's full realized in both interaction and appearance.Still of Rango What most people have touched on when talking about the pros of this movie is, indeed, the stellar animationand, boy, is it stellar. Granted, some of the human cameos are kind of on the flat side, but our animal heroes are textured and expressive, which is important in this kind of movie. We can reach out and touch these sets if we were able; the roughness of the scales, the harsh desert heat and the sponge and spikes of cacti that crop up throughout are just a few of the details in this grand visual experience. The characters that make up this floundering town are actually interesting to look at and listen to, as the animation and awesome voice work give them all distinct and likable personalities. The voices are great with each voice actor doing a fantastic job bringing these characters to life.Resident include old prospector mouse Spoons, large, but quiet tomcat Elgin, morose, trigger happy little aye-aye Priscilla (Breslin), and, my favorite, the kind, but no-nonsense Beans (Fischer), a rancher lizard who finds herself falling for the goofy, but sincere hero. But, by far, the biggest fan favorite has to be Bill Nighy's rogue, Rattlesnake Jake, who is hands-down, flat-out scary in any scene he is in! How any kid will survive his scenes is beyond me! However, that made him more of a threat that Rango needs to overcome, which is more satisfying in the long run.For movie fans there are references throughout. One that really stands out is an epic scene involving a man with no name and a golf cart.Ultimate coolness. Don't make the mistake comparing this to CGI movies like Ice Age,Kungfu Panda or similar. Approach it like it is fully fledged western that has everything and more of that genre.If you get past that than you will have the pleasure to see one of the most funny and entertaining movies made this year.However, the story has nothing new to offer. The fake hero plot is old, we've seen it in animated movies too, like Chicken Run. The liar with a potential good heart returns to save the cityThe rotten leader who sells out his people is not a bright and blossomy idea either, only in this here movie, we have the tortoise, usually an animal of wisdom, representing the corrupted character, in a rather uninspired association made out of negligence or just to avoid a more clicheistic animal. While that may seem rather unoriginal you have never seen the ""new place, new identity"" gimmick done like this.This animation is a great way to introduce children to the classic western theme.The landscape is beautiful, the enemies are great and the soundtrack is perfectly suited to the film (there is a fantastic version of ride of the Valkyries). The film is packed with satirical humor that helps to keep the film fresh and helps the elements of the film to come together perfectly and you can tell that everyone was on the same page when they made this film.I rate it 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not Funny,"I read a lot of good reviews about this movie and i went with high expectations, but i got out from the theater disappointed.I'm no a movie critic, i'm just someone who wants to enjoy a movie. Rango, being an animated movie and with the picture showing him with one eye ball bigger than the other, gives the impression of being a funny movie. The jokes in Rango do not make the adult audience laugh, most of them are targeted for children, but ironically, this movie is not for children either, because the story is too complicated for them.It is true that the animations are great, but we have seen this before. Great animation would be enough to make a movie if it is some new technique or technology like avatar or toy story.In Summary, kids will not understand this movie.

"Rango... Every archetype, convention and finest detail is here! The west lives on...","Rango... yes it is a play on the classic Western Django. Thats why its so interesting!I had eagerly awaited the arrival of Rango, not only as a western fan but also as an admirer of Gore Verbinski; and the inclusion of Johnny Depp has yet to be a bad thing. The trailers had almost completely left out any kind of plot hint, which i now realise was a very good decision.So, the story is that a chameleon, with acting ambitions, longs for social interaction outside of his lonely environment. His wishes are granted when he stumbles into the western town of 'Dirt' and takes over the vacant role of Sheriff. When he discovers the towns water supply is almost run dry he searches for answers along side the townsfolk, all of whom believe Rango to be their Saviour.If you have seen the trailer you will have noticed the singing mariachi owls, who tunefully break down the forth wall to open the film. Not too dissimilar to the rooster in Disney's classic Robin Hood they help guide the story along and in doing so also keep you guessing. Which was a real bonus for me in terms of animated films as they do tend to get predictable, despite how well they are told.Rango himself upon first meet is absolutely NOT a hero. Even more interesting though is that his name is not Rango. In fact we have no clue as to what his name is... no doubt an obvious reference to the classic Spaghetti Westerns to which its inspired by and its Eastwood lead 'Man with No Name' character. But Rango, despite his lack of name, knows what he wants and Verbinski very clearly makes sure the audience knows too... He wants the chance to be a hero and to one have a story to tell. Let the narrative unfold...The real winner here is the scenery, its animated alright but i was struggling to believe that at various points in the film. The scene in the saloon towards the beginning is fantastically lit and the final showdown is shot better than a lot of the classics. I'm not kidding! In fact I would happily pay to see it again just to look at those shots again because they capture the tension so well.Although the real audience is those who love the classic west, Verbinski is able to make it accessible to a vast number. The younger audiences will definitely appreciate Depp's eccentric character as well as the very well timed humour, both visually and verbally. The more mature audiences will appreciate the latter a lot more so. The story is excellent! It unravels perfectly and its runtime passes by almost without effort.Rango is western... make no mistake. But i assure you one thing should you decide to give it a chance, its what it needs to be! Its entertaining, action-packed, funny and sincere. Above all else, it has what makes a great film, alongside the great protagonist is a great antagonist! Rattlesnake Jake is scary... he's great with his words and deadly with his gun and he helps build to a great and tense final showdown!Rango gets 10/10 from me!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Solitary deserts, crossed by roads most travelled","Our storytelling notions as evolved in the past 2,000 years are basically ideal templates of what it means to live a meaningful life; what sacrifices to make, why to persevere and what actually matters in the end. It would be interesting if we could somehow know if the chronicles followed the first epic journey or if man embarked upon it to fulfill his place in the legend; at any rate, whatever journeys took place, the epic seems to be the bard's connotation.We have here one such thing that weaves together both the telling and what pre-existed it, where all the mechanisms of that Campbellian hero journey are self-consciously laid on top. The hero (not yet the hero) yanked from life by some unforeseen circumstance, thrown into a path foiled by the ironies of distant fates where he must search inside for a heroic sacrifice that serves as a lesson to the world. A path, which once travelled to the destination, will invite others to it.The beauty of that self-consciousness lies in how the filmmaker whimsically indulges it. So in the beginning we get the hero (not yet the hero) removed from life inside a glass cage, where he enacts various stories (none of them his, all imagined). Over the course of the movie we see elements of these stories come magically alive, so that reality eventually conforms with what was imagined of it.The added effect is that all this takes place in the world of the western, the cinematic world imprinted with the legends of the bards, Ford or Leone. What the filmmaker strives to do here is not so much to unearth what reality pre-existed the myth, but to expose myth for its addled romance as it is about to be swept away by a new reality.So we have two swathes of solitary desert separated by the road most travelled, a symbolic way across which we understand the rite of passing will be enacted. On the other end of it waits the Spirit of the West, a familiar sight wearing a poncho yet now oddly playing golf.What connects them is the plot from Chinatown, where corrupt plutocrats are scheming to usurp complete power and the only ones who can stand in their way are those old gunslinging legends, real or imagined, who will be swept away by the outcome. Like in Peckinpah 40 years ago.The cuteness we sensibly expect from animation is peppered through this. There is the impossible action spectacle, the shenanigans. But it's not a film for children. The driving idea will be probably lost on them; how the quest here is not to save a dusty town from drought, but to sever the illusions that hide our true face from us. How although we embark on various journeys through life having assumed one identity or another, these journeys can be properly seen through by a self-less self.""I am nobody"" as Rango says, perhaps echoing that other Johnny Depp western that tried to achieve emptiness.In doing so even the chronicles, here disguised as three Mexican owls singing about the eventual demise of the hero, will be proved wrong. Which is to say that no fate exists other than what we accept.We get a bunch of things here, all of them pretty exceptional for an animation film. Most of them better than what we find in regular films of this ilk. Pixar hasn't come close.",,Anonymous,Animation
It seems like studios found again a great chance of covering the defunct storytelling with mesmerizing visuals and impressive editing.,"Every film product must satisfy it's audience. Since we're talking about an animated film, the goals are harder to obtain simply because you must project a rich and attractive story filled with funny moments and a detailed animated world. We've seen animated movies made for a smaller audience like, for example, The Illusionist from last year, which addresses adults and not underaged idealists. Rango is a movie for all ages because probably everyone will have a good time watching it. But having a good time watching a movie describes how good the movie really is?... Is Rango that good? The western adventures of the simple and clumsy lizard Rango (Johnny Depp) borrows elements from Leone's classic westerns, refurnishes the set-ups, creates a comfortable world for the viewer and starts to convert the old-fashioned western story. While it may be remarkably smart written, the story is dragged around the biggest clichés in animated films. We all understand Rango is a perfect reason to pay homage to one of the greatest eras in film history, however, was it necessary to offer a predictable and pointless story? The lonely guy (or lizard in this case) with no friends and no actual talents whatsoever, integrates in a community (Dirt Town) threatened by an oppressive ruler (The Mayor) and becomes the local hero by luck and chance while defeating a local villain. After a short period of popularity he loses all the credibility and affection by getting engaged in a duel with the big villain (in our case, the town's mayor) which unveils his true face and forces him leave his people with his tail behind his legs. But somehow, in the middle of nowhere he finds hope and courage with the help of some unusual force and decides to go back to his people and free them from the oppressor because that's (obviously) the right thing to do. Wait... I'm hearing some of you interrupting me ""Will he get the girl Julian?""... Of course he'll get the girl mate... We all know the story, and we're already bored by it thanks to the tens and tens of movies using the same narrative ingredients. The story structure in Rango is not only common but is also deceivable, clichéd and pointless since it adds no gram of originality.Despite the beautiful look of the film and impressive execution nothing makes me care about our hero. Where's the emotion?... Where's the emotional core? Rango has emotional moments but not because we care about our main character but because we somehow pledge to the loneliness and hopeless described at some point in the movie. Was that really necessary for Rango?... I will say that it wasn't. The funny moments in the film are barely even there, few laughs in the theater but mostly there were just smiles and voices around me debating something but not the actual movie. Most of these funny moments don't even come from our main protagonist but from our secondary characters. We also have that classic group of characters that create a bridge from one point of the story to the other. The four singing owls represent the narrator's voice but they are useless since they are neither funny nor entertaining. They just come, sing and leave without making a strong point. You will forget about them as soon as their scenes end.As if the gasps in the storytelling's design were not enough, Rango confronts with... politics. An animated film satirizing the world's current issues like our main economical problems and our hunger for resources. Rango depicts the selfishness and creates a pretty dark and actually marxist character in the town's mayor. I was thinking that, okay, it's a understandable thing for adults but is it good for a kid to watch this and being told that if the people don't obey the rules they must be eliminated?... I don't know, maybe I'm a little bit off-topic but I think such delicate issues like that should not be addressed directly to kids.Going to the voice casting, there were good choices but I can summarize Johnny Depp's vocal impersonation as being close to an animated Jack Sparrow: same tonality, same laugh, same mumbling... It looks like he really has a hard time getting over that character. I felt the entire movie I witnessed an animated green and skinny Jack Sparrow. But enough is enough.Let's take a moment and applaud the incredible technical execution of this movie. The picture looked so clean and perfectly drawn, the colors were alive and powerful, the contrasts and the sound mixing and editing was really really impressive. The fight scenes looked like the epic grand-scale battle scenes from movies like Avatar or Star Wars... The cinematography was gorgeous and I must say I was impressed with some of the techniques used in the film. There is a shot of Rango dreaming and that crossover from reality to dreams and back to reality was simply amazing. It's a jaw-dropping visual world. Even the score was good. Good choice of music and not a single waste of wrong tones or anything like that. Everything fitted the movie wonderfully. Rango really blew out the water other animations and is a real step forward into animated drawings and design. It's like a concept car or a new burger. It's fresh.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wonderful Western Animation,"""Rango"" is more appealing to adults than to kids. It has a lot of reference to the old western movies which kids might not understand. There is nothing new about this movie but ""Rango"" is visually stunning, full of decency and totally hilarious.Though there are problems about the story but it's dark, crazy, and exciting.The story is nothing but reference of other western movies. It's kind of a remembrance but it's not compelling and new. There is nothing new about the story. It's just a western relic.The best thing about this movie is its animation. The visuals are wonderful and eye candy. The character design looks old fashion zany and I love it. Kind of reminded me of ""The Misadventures of Flapjack"" a TV show from CN. While this movie is from Nickelodeon there are some humor that kids will perhaps laugh. The movie is not in 3D. ""Rango"" proves us that 3D is not necessary to our lives. 3D shrinks the scale of a movie.There are no flaws with the voice acting. Johnny Depp is really meant for Rango. Isla Fisher did this before in Horton Hears A Who so it's okay. Bill Nighy is an amazing villain. I want more Ned Beattys' sexy voice. Too bad Timothy Olyphant didn't have enough scenes but it's still great.My favorite thing about the visuals is the environment. Look at the sky and the desert. Cinematography is also great. Every visuals are eye candy. The scene when Rango and his friends are being chased by bats and gophers is truly breathtaking.Maybe the reason why Ebert gave this movie a perfect rating because it's not in 3D. Well Rango is not flawless but it is still entertaining. If you like beautiful visuals then I will recommend this movie to death. The story is not really unique. It's still worth watch. The merits makes us ignore the flaws of this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"a scrillion movie references, maybe more","Finally, a Gore Verbinksi movie I like, and it's an animated Chinatown (1974)! This flick has exquisite animation and writing, and Johnny Depp is just right for the part. He deftly plays a metrosexual theatre-type of a chameleon living what he thinks is his best life until he is catapulted out of his comfy-cozy existence as a kept pet into the middle of the desert. In his quest to return he encounters a Carlos Casteneda armadillo who points out that perhaps his former caged existence wasn't worth returning to because, for instance, he had no friends. His ""friends"" were plastic toys. The armadillo directs him on his new quest: water. It's a delightful depiction of an engaging story with a scrillion movie references, maybe more.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Watch out Pixar!,"I approached this movie with caution. I anticipated entertainment from reading some reviews, but was weary as always of its blockbuster character. Let's be honest: Nickelodeon has been consistently pouring out terrible movies; Gore Verbinski has yet to prove himself outside the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise; John Logan, despite all his brilliance in other screenplays, hasn't shown to be at the same level with animation, as his work in Sinbad attests to. So, critical acclaim aside, i wasn't convinced...But scratch all that! This is a new age for Nickelodeon, a defining moment for Verbinski and a testament to Logan's literary genius.Rango has everything: masterful CGI, impeccable storytelling, radiating creativity, surgical attention to detail, humility, depth, vision; and almost none of the usual handicaps, clichés and mistakes of the genre. And let's not forget humor, a cascading, gushing, showering deluge of humor: meta humor, black humor, adult humor, satire, parody, and of course, potty humor. But its crowning moment is its referential humor, its homages - the Spirit of the West, the Fear & Loathing... All beautifully interwoven into the story in a way that separates it from what so many mash-up comedies try to do (and fail horribly).The western genre is made fun of repeatedly, but never is it ridiculed or tarnished. It's a story made with love and admiration for its themes. A wondrous thing in this cynical world and a rarity amid comedy. Humanity is reflected perfectly in this fable. And viscerally. With all its flaws and weaknesses, and all its charms and achievements. And despite the many anecdotes, despite the myriad caricatures, it's never shallow, never false. It remains true to its principles and offers as many laughs as lessons. And by that, i am truly amazed.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"GNDN (Goes Nowhere, Does Nothing)","This was a movie I wanted to like (I really did) but it just never came together and fell into the pit of average. The character development never gets past Rango so the rest of the cast is nothing more than minor support roles. Villain's are numerous but no one really stands out and it leaves you feeling like a repeat of Spiderman III, one hero, three villains, drifting story.One of the key ingredient to a successful animation is relatable characters. With Rango, the characters are so ugly that you find yourself not caring if the desert or something else swallows them up. Relating to them is next to impossible as they are too foreign to be relative.The story is about finding yourself, being a hero, finding faith, not giving up, knowing your friends, and being a fast-talker. There might have been more but with so many moments it was impossible know what this story really wanted to be. It is far better to create a simple story and add depth than to throw all your ideas on the table and try to paste them into parallel story lines that make sense.It might make a good rental for the kids although very young ones might be frightened by the snake scenes but its not worth movie ticket priced.

"""The Name's Rango""","Rango is an ordinary chameleon who accidentally winds up in the town of Dirt, a lawless outpost in the Wild West in desperate need of a new sheriff.You can consider me a partial animation movie fan. I LOVE Pixar, I'll settle for some Dreamwork, but all the rest do not grab my interest. So the story begins... Rango, a Nickelodeon movie, firstly turned me off. I didn't follow it around so much until the director was revealed. Gore Verbinski has some intelligent works: Pirates, Ring. With this provided, I had some thought that he could pull of his first animation. And he did... Rango is a western. Believe it or not, the film is presented, moves on like, and overall is a western. The man with ""no name"" (which in this movie has a name; non-cliché) walks into a western town, shakes up some trouble, and the adventure begins. The animation in this film is wondrous. I didn't have the time to see it on the big-screen, but once I feasted my eyes on the brilliant animation, I was in for a treat. The voice acting was obviously wonderful (Johnny Depp!) and everyone else did a fantastic job. The film also had some impressive humor. Seeing as this was PG, I had only small expectations for this, but it blends in adult and child humor together. You will surely be laughing along the ride. In fact, the film gathered nods to modern cinema. You'll have references from Fear and Loathing in Vegas, Star Wars, and even the infamous Clint Eastwood films (especially that ONE scene.) I didn't have too much to complain about in this film, it was highly impressive. Another kudos goes to the wonderful soundtrack. It's adventurous, loud, and surely kicks you into the film. Alongside everything, and combined together: I surely recommend Rango! It's a great family one that everyone will enjoy, and although the film may be classified as a kiddo's film, the film is surely going to surprise you. I give Rango a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
It's Fun For All Ages,"Rare is the animated feature that will be of appeal to ages 6 to 96, but ""Rango"" seems to have accomplished that balance rather nicely. Kudos to all who were involved with this production, but especially to the animators. The animation in this was absolutely brilliant. While it's obvious that walking and talking animals are animated, the details of the Town of Dirt and the desert landscape take on a definite sense of reality. In those scenes where there are no characters on screen it would be very easy to forget that this is in fact an animated feature.The story has something for everyone. Basically, this is a Western in animated form. Rango is a pet chameleon who as a result of a car accident gets separated from his family on a highway in the middle of the desert. Being a domestic animal, he has no idea what to do or how to survive until a helpful armadillo tells him the direction to a nearby town where he should be able to get water. Stumbling across the desert, he finally comes across the small Town of Dirt, populated entirely by animals of various sorts. Struggling to fit in, he spins a few yarns about himself and his adventures and where he came from, and he ends up quite accidentally as a local hero and as the local sheriff who suddenly has to confront the town's great mystery - the water supply is quickly disappearing.The details of the story are really oriented far more toward adults than children, and those who let children watch this should know going in that there's some mildly harsh language and a few scenes that might be frightening for little ones. But they'll enjoy the animation. Kids love animated animals - and all ages will enjoy some of the action sequences in the movie, which - like the rest of the animation - is very well done, and quite believable.I thought this weakened perhaps a bit in the last half hour or so. At that point (really, with the introduction of Jake the Rattlesnake, who was as the rest very well animated, but who was also a rather menacing character) a lot of the fun of the movie disappeared, and it actually became a rather heavy story toward the end. The ultimate moral of the story is that Rango has to find himself and be himself. In the end, once the reason for the disappearing water supply becomes obvious, there's also a bit of an environmental message, but it wasn't preachy at all, and for the most part it was very entertaining.

Nickelodeon bares its fangs,"So a slight blurb about how surprised I was that Nickelodeon was tackling several mature themes: Rango boasted quite a number of darker undertones that you wouldn't normally expect from a PG, animated Nickelodeon movie. Such areas included language (sporting such lines as ""You son of a-""!, ""Go to hell!"", and ""Can I gut-shoot someone?""), violence (an impressive amount of shooting and dying), sexual themes (making references to how ""active"" one's mother was and a joke about a mammogram), and the film's portrayal of death (where characters constantly expect Rango's death and at one point, parody death by hanging). That is, you could arguably find just as much material in other animated films, such as The Incredibles- but it just goes to show that Nickelodeon is ready to experiment with a braver sort of film, much like Disney did with Pirates of the Caribbean. Okay, disclaimer over.Rango is beautiful film that, regardless of its content, gave everyone in the theater a darn good time. Borrowing heavily from classic Westerns (The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly) and Western comedies (The Three Amigos), the film brings reinvents a past formula in an amusingly creative way. Rango, a pet chameleon unsure about how he wants his identity to develop, is suddenly cast to into the life of the wild wild west and decides to assume the duties of the sheriff in a troubled town. When the gunslingin' enemies arrive, the trouble begins...If anything, the film is revolutionary in its animation. The quality and textures of the animals and landscape is simply spot-on and never ceases to amaze. By far this is the movie's greatest strength- and supporting the beautiful visuals is a whole slew of jokes. Like I said before, sometimes the humor is a bit awkward for its targeted audience (there were definitely a lot of times adults laughed instead of the kids) but for the most part the theater as a whole enjoyed the comedic spots. The voice acting cast is of course lively and fun, bringing a unique quality to each and every animal character. And lastly, the score by Hans Zimmer is once again majestic and exciting (influences from his work in Pirates and Sherlock Holmes are easily heard, but with a Mexican twist!).Overall, Rango is a beautiful and exciting western adventure that you shouldn't miss! As long as you know what you're in for, the humor and the visuals will take you for an unforgettably pleasing ride. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good...,"""Rango"" is an Animation - Adventure movie in which we follow a chameleon named Rango, who accidentally becomes the sheriff of a desert town called Dirt.I enjoyed this animation movie because it blended elements of westerns, adventure, and comedy in a way that's both imaginative and bold. The whole animation in ""Rango"" was stunning, with vibrant colors and intricate details that made the world come to life. However, despite the movie's visual appeal and quirky charm, it occasionally struggled with pacing and tone while in some moments felt overly stretched, something that left the audience disconnected. In addition to this, in some moments the movie didn't balance very well humor with story despite its moments of cleverness and creativity.

So boring I fell asleep!!,"I rarely write reviews. But sometimes the Public need to be protected from underhanded marketing and paid-off critics. I read the reviews and saw the previews and went to see this horrible excuse for a Pixar knock-off. If anyone here is expecting something clever you can forget it. There's very few funny lines except for the previews you saw which made you want to come in the first place. There's an unimaginative reference throughout to a well-known classic film. I hope it isn't supposed to be an homage because it seems more like a second class ripoff. There are pedestrian references to other films as well. Typical of mainstream Hollywood's lack of imagination today. The movie is so boring I actually found myself falling asleep. Which hasn't happened since I made the mistake of attending an opera. Lest you think I'm alone in this opinion my wife said she found herself falling asleep as well and when she turned to tell me, while in the movie, saw that I was dozing. The animation is top-notch but it should be in this day and age. The script is so poor it never ceases to amaze me how today's screenwriters get work. I've written better blindfolded. Verbinski's success at the box office with the Pirates franchise has the Suits in Hollywood fooled into thinking that he can actually direct well. His pacing in this terrible movie is made for an audience of snails. Johnny Depp who is always great has nothing to work with here. Sad waste of his talent as it was for all the actors here who do the best with what little they were given. I'm giving it 3 stars for the animation alone and the Los Lobos theme song.

Pure Awesomeness,"This film is a masterpiece and a glorious piece of animation. Firstly, you've got to recognize the film's balls. Instead of aiming to please the general audiences with cute and cuddly creatures, the characters you see here are anything but attractive. How many times have I seen an audience wooed to praise a film because of its 'cute factor'? No such shenanigans here. Secondly, it's a gritty storyline that holds faithful to the Western tradition. Its story telling isn't sugar coated and neither is its dialogue, surely to the dismay of some parents I assume. Its distinct style is why this film is so enjoyable and truth be told it probably isn't for all ages, but these days with morals going right out the windows, is it fair to say the argument starts to become invalid? Bill Nighy, as Rattlesnake Jake, was just bad-ass, awesome presence. Johnny Depp is remarkable as our Chameleon, and many other well done voice acting is in the film. Like Alfred Molina and Isla Fisher. The score by Hans Zimmer is irresistible, sounding very much like dare I say a Spaghetti Western. You even get to hear Richard Wagner's ""Ride of the Valkyries"" played briefly by the strings of a banjo.

Rango (2011) - Johnny Depp is a Lizard? Are You Kidding Me?,"After years of portraying such wacky characters including Capt. Jack Sparrow, Willy Wonka, Sweeney Todd, and Edward Scissorhands, Johnny Depp has brought another excellent performance on the screen in his greatest animated performance since ""Corpse Bride"". ""Rango"" is the story of an outsider, who's a lizard, who travels to the town of Dirt to find water, when accidentally gets a chance to be brave for himself by becoming the town's new sheriff. Along the way, he learns about believing in himself for who he is, and not by his accomplishments. Now, the movie was one of the coolest animated features I have ever seen. I was actually entertained by every single moment that the movie had to offer. Johnny Depp, once again brings another wacky performance of excellence. For his performance as Rango, Depp brought the same type of uniqueness that he brings to all his characters that include: charisma, charm, wackiness, weirdness, and craziness. Also, Isla Fisher, Stephen Root, Bill Nighy, Ned Beatty, Alfred Molina, Ray Winstone, and Abigail Breslin brings an excellent casting ensemble that's perfect in every way.

"Rango is a creative, dazzling, and funny tribute to classic spaghetti westerns, but it's definitely not a kid's movie.","A couple days ago, I started 2011 off on a solid note with The Adjustment Bureau, but that solid note has now risen to a brilliant note with the release of Gore Verbinski's Rango.Johnny Deep provides the voice of the title character, a chameleon house pet who gets lost in the middle of the Mojave Desert, and through a series of effective fibs, as well as killing a lethal hawk by accident, winds up the sheriff of the town he wandered into known as Dirt, a town low on water supplies, and on the brink of total drought and dehydration. Rango decides to investigate the mystery surrounding the low supplies, and quite often bites off more than he can chew.The direction by Gore Verbinski, who garners enthusiastic and terrific performances from his voice cast, is wonderful, and the screenplay by John Logan pays tribute to the classic spaghetti westerns of yesteryear, right down to pre gunfight stand offs, important events happening at high noon, and the decision to have a Mariachi band narrate, and make comment on the film's events. Sure, a couple scenes seem to overstay their welcome, but in spite of that one flaw, the film is fresh, and funny, and the film quite often got a good laugh from myself. I also loved visual references to characters played by Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef in The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.I must also praise the technical crew. This is the first animated feature designed by the legendary special effects company Industrial Light & Magic, and John Knoll does a good job at supervising the film's many grand, colorful and photo realistic images. I have just as much praise for the audio crew. Sound editor Addison Teague does a good job at handling classic western sound effects such as gunfire and galloping hooves, and Hans Zimmer (whose music score pays delightful homage to the scores of Ennio Morricone) does a great job at heightening the excitement and wit.Before I sign off, I must make a final point. I'm normally not too vocal about censorship, but take the facts that the film is animated, and rated PG with a huge grain of salt, because Rango is NOT a kid's movie. The images are quite quirky, and sometimes even trippy, some of the subject material is rather violent and foul mouthed, and some of the jokes may fly way over kids' heads, but that's exactly why I think the film's so special. The film makers stuck to their guns, and didn't wimp out in order to get a bigger audience of children. It's a movie almost strictly for older viewers, and should be treated as such.Needless to say, I loved Rango. I give it ***1/2 out of ****",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
The best kids movies aren't always for kids,"What sort of expectations can you possibly set for a CGI kids movie about a lizard in the old West? For me, it was relatively none. I didn't think anything of Rango after seeing the first trailers and immediately discarded it as another kiddie film that I would have no reason to see. But then the movie came out and the buzz began and the surprisingly positive reviews started coming out. It wasn't long before I decided I actually did need to see this movie. It was a while till I got around to actually doing the deed, but boy was it worth it.Rango is, and I mean this in an utterly sincere fashion, an incredibly brilliant film. Johnny Depp stars as the voice of the title character, Rango, a pet chameleon who falls out of the back of his owner's truck while on the highway, only to find himself lost in the vastness of the Nevada desert. He eventually finds his way to the town of Dirt, an old and decrepit town filled with old and decrepit rodents who are in desperate need of water before their town dries up. Rango shows up alone in the town, known by nobody, so he decides to create a new persona for himself, dawning an Eastwood-esque man with no name facade that gets him into a lot more trouble than he bargained for. The film is sharp, hysterical, action-packed, and more trippy than you can believe.Rango possesses an immaculate sense of bizarre uniqueness that carries the film and makes it a truly wild experience. It delivers a painfully hilarious script backed by very impressive voice acting and Gore Verbinski's direction of the film gives it a cartoony and incredibly entertaining flare. This film is of a certain quality that is so rare within the kid film genre, especially the part of the genre that isn't made by Pixar. Rango takes CGI storytelling to a whole new level and transcends the ideas of what your typical talking animal film should look like and feel like. Pixar is known for its low brow subtleties that allow adults to enjoy their films as much as kids. Rango, on the other hand, takes it a step further and prides itself on its clever innuendos and shockingly inappropriate quips. To a certain demographic (i.e. uptight parents) this is appalling and disgusting. But to me, I thought it was genius to market a film as a kids flick and then blow the rest of us away when we realize that this is a film that arguably has more humor aimed towards adults than kids. While some may bash Rango for this, I give it incredulous amounts of kudos.Not only is Rango's humor great and it makes the film a blast, the action sequences in the film are brilliantly fun and the overall visual quality of the flick is superb. Gore Verbinski directs the film with incredible finesse, showing off a range of styles within one two hour film. The film can be wacky and fun, as well as sophisticated and sincere with direction, artistic design, and cinematography that captures the various moods and atmospheres Rango weaves through. And of course let's not forget the amazing CGI. The detail of every last hair on the back of a rodent, every last scale on a lizard, and every last grain of sand in the vast open desert is mind boggling. The film is pieced together so well artistically, possessing not a single flaw in its visual integrity.And perhaps what I love most about the look of this film is that it breaks all stereotypes of the idealized talking CGI animals that we are familiar with. There is nothing cute or fluffy about these critters. They are absolutely the ugliest bunch of greasy, grimy, disgusting rodents ever animated onto the big screen. The characters in this film resemble the things you find under the sink and then promptly kill and/or scream in terror. And that is really what Rango is all about in essence. It isn't about idealizing the happy-go-lucky world of talking animals. It highlights the more grotesque aspects of this fantasy land, while still managing to be hysterical. When it comes to animated films, you won't see enough like Rango, so see this movie so you don't miss out on one of the best ""kids films"" to come out in a long time.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Smooth, mass and comic","I'm so much keen to watch those kinds of animations and for sure Rango will be on the list of the best. That was a kind of flowery fragrance of the setting and betting up a brilliant portrayal of a cowboy like a theme. Johnny Depp's voice was so remarkable and the exact representation of Clint Eastwood cuddles all the way. On flowing with smooth, mass and comic elements was a power-packed outcome from Verbinski. As a debut animation director Verbinski gone above the mark. We welcome a lot more kinds of stuff from you, man.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Possibly the most enjoyable film of the 2011,"I always had mixed feeling about the filmography of Gore Verbinsky (I think that ""The Ring"" and the Trilogy of the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" were decent, entertaining pop-corn flicks) On the other side, I thought that ""The Mexican"", ""Mousehunt"" and ""The Weather Man"" were awful films, lacking of any artistic or entertaining value.However, I must recognize that he did a great work this time. ""Rango"" is not only one of the best animated flicks that I've seen in the recent years, but also, one of the most enjoyable movies from the recent times. It is fresh, original, and fascinating, being completely different to all the CGI movies that came in the previous years.It works incredibly well as a spoof/homage of the spaghetti Western, combining the classic elements of the genre with the very special touch that is present in all the movies of Verbinsky (Yes, even the worse ones) It is incredibly weird, but also it is extremely funny and clever at the same time.Personally, I loved the character designs: Some people find them ""ugly"", but the ""ugliness"" of the characters is done in a beautiful, stylish way: All of them have a unique, strange appearance that makes them appealing and fascinating.The level of detail and the atmosphere of this film are simply magnificent; every single frame of this film it's a like a work of art, a incredibly extravaganza where Gore Verbinsky let his imagination run wild...But the most incredible thing is that he find a way to make this wild ride something enjoyable and entertaining.""Rango"" is the best movie of Gore Verbinsky. It is his most personal work, taking the best elements of all his previous movies, finding the greatness.I think that in a few years, this movie will be considered the ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" of this decade. After seeing ""Rango"", I'm convinced that a new classic is born.10/10 (I would give it eleven stars if I could)",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
liked this film but then again i am in it,"So I watched Rango from 2011 and starring Johnny Depp. So was this movie good, I say yes you bastards, sorry I tend to curse when I channel the voice of Dr. Duke. I am perhaps a little bit biased in my assessment of this film, I do have a very brief cameo in it. Look for me in the beginning I am driving the Cadillac with my lawyer in the back seat. This is a kids film, but fortunately it is one of those films the adults can enjoy as well (the fact that I am in it should tell you that). The story is very predictable and has been done a million times in a million movies. We have a fish out of water (well lizard), who pretends to be something he is not, gets caught eventually, but comes back to both redeem himself and save the day and of course gets the girl. However, it is the original take on this premise as well as the subtle deeper thoughts that this movie touches on that makes it good. It also is one of the most beautifully animated films I have seen yet. I heard this movie is spectacular in 3D, which is something I would not doubt. So this movie is well shot, well written, and well acted, it has great and original characters, and in general is really good for a kids movie. I will say this critters die in this flick something I was not expecting in a kids movie. But then again it is not graphic and we are talking about birds and other such critters so unless your kid doesn't understand why grandma can't come over for the holidays anymore, don't worry about your kids watching this film. Most people should enjoy this film it is very enjoyable on many different levels and as I said visually stunning.

Underrated Wild West animation!,"Rango is a quirky and unique animated movie that follows a chameleon living in a western town with anthropomorphic humanoid animals. When a rival bandit gang attacks, Rango sets out on a wild adventure to become the brave hero he claimed to be and save the day. Along the way, he discovers the true meaning of heroism and overcomes numerous challenges and obstacles through his determination, wit, and resourcefulness. It's a funny, action-packed story with a clever sense of humor and some valuable life lessons for young and old.The message of Rango is that true bravery is not about putting yourself on a pedestal or portraying a heroic image. It's about being true to who you are, regardless of what others think. It's about not only being willing, but eager, to step up when the situation calls for it. In the end, being a hero isn't about being perfect, it's about doing what needs to be done, even when it's hard.I would say the best aspect of Rango is its unique sense of humor. It's both witty and clever, while also touching on some deep topics and emotions. The characters are colorful and enjoyable, and the plot is full of twists and turns. It's just a really fun movie to watch and one that leaves you thinking about it long after it ends.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Rango (2011),"A bit of an oddball animation from Gore Verbinski which rivals, and occasionally exceeds, Pixar's crowning achievements in animation technology with some tremendous textural details and cinematographic effects, aided I'm sure by Roger Deakins's input.Johnny Depp provides the voice of a theatrical but lonely pet chameleon who takes on the character of top gunslinger Rango after he gets lost in the desert and meets a town of grizzled Wild West creatures. Verbinski has fun rolling out all the good old Western clichés and film references, particularly a corruption plot straight out of Chinatown.My only criticism of what is otherwise a very entertaining, gleefully wacky and visually outstanding animation is a lack of that undefinable factor ""heart"", something which I feel is that niggling X factor which Pixar consistently hits and its competitors don't.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Grossly Overrated Film,"Rango (Johnny Depp) is an ordinary chameleon who accidentally winds up in the town of Dirt, a lawless outpost in the Wild West in desperate need of a new sheriff.How this film won the Oscar for best animated film of 2011 is beyond me. All I can think is that there just were not very strong contenders for the prize (I know I cannot think of any). I will say the animation itself is amazing -- it is quite possibly the best animation I have ever seen. So, George Lucas, you have outdone Pixar and you should be proud.And I will also say I enjoyed the references to ""True Grit"", Clint Eastwood and Lee VanCleef. Oh ,and Hunter Thompson. I think those were an excellent touch. I wish that Eastwood himself could have lent his distinctive voice.But the film does seem to just feel very flat for me. While the plot is alright, I could not get myself to care about the characters. Who lived or died was of little consequence to me... even Rango himself was not much of a hero.Roger Ebert says the film is ""wonderfully made, great to look at, wickedly satirical"" and he gives it four stars! The review is a big, slobbery kiss with repeated calls to see it and bring your family. I guess whatever Ebert was drinking must not be in my refrigerator.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Western Chameleon,"Gore Verbinski's 'Rango' tells the story of a pet Chameleon who suddenly finds himself stranded in a desert where he meets a number of colourful unpleasant characters. With vivid animation, vivacious characters and plenty of energy, this little film highly entertains. It's not the best of its genre as there are problems with pacing and it does occasionally tend to derail from the main story. Needless to say it requires the 'Madagascar' level of suspension of disbelief. The humour works in most parts even if at times it tends to be a little too all over the place, leaving no time to resonate. The voice acting is superb, especially by leads Johnny Depp, Bill Nighy, Ned Beatty and Isla Fisher. Verbinski also pays several references to Western classics. This is a cute and funny tribute to that once-popular genre that dominated the screen in the 60s.",,Anonymous,Animation
Not a kids movie!,"I actually loved the movie, I only felt it was a little long. It made me laugh, it made me sad, it was visually stunning, and the story was refreshingly new. However, this film was advertised as a movie for children. I just want to give a heads up to parents considering taking their young children to see this movie that it is verbally offensive at parts, and the story line is one that you probably don't want your children to comprehend. A lot of the dialogue centers around who is going to be murdering whom, and sending them to hell. There is also a lot of shooting, so if this is something you'd like to spare your children from, be warned. I'd say a 10-13 year old range would be an acceptable starting audience. But at the end of the day, this movie is more for the older crowd. Otherwise, ENJOY! It will make you laugh.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Good, but...","It's hard for me to review this movie. I have mixed feelings about much of the film. Yes, the visual experience is fascinating, the movie has flashes of pure genius, some of the dialog is witty and entertaining, etc...But, then there is the nonsensical story, the absence of anything resembling a real plot, and... the sickeningly politically correct last part of the motion picture. I will not explain further what it is about in order to avoid any possible spoilers, but it is typically 'green dogooder' Hollywood, inserted into the movie without any plausible reason whatsoever other than to subtly impress upon the viewer a political opinion without seeming to be openly doing so. This is what I call 'brainwashing', and it is despicable, the worst sort of propaganda.So there you have it, certainly a good movie, but also one that leaves a (very) sour taste in the mouth (at least for me).",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Artistically, it's very well made, but the writing was familiar.","I love how realistic the sands, roads and buildings are. This feels like the crew went on location to film real scenes (maybe with live actors filling in for the CGI characters) and digitized in cartoon like characters with slight animation on the scenery to make the audience not know which was real or drawn. Unfortunately, nothing else was of much interest. The story is the same meandering tale of a guy (in this case lizard) who moseys into town and makes a name for himself. He also lies about said name and about his adventures in the past. Of course, the town is in danger and they need his help. Inevitably, he will go from zero to hero, but be a fraud until the big climax. None of the supporting characters stood out and neither did most of the scenes.

One of my favorite movies of all time,"A wholly amazing masterpiece, combining animation and western styles.In the modern word of animation where everything is all cutesy and fluffy, Rango embraces its gritty and asymetrical characters, places, and atmosphere. This makes for an etremely engaging cast and scenes.The music is really fun, and is even humouristically diagetic when it needs to.The themes of Identity and redemption resonate greatly throughout this movie (and mak a lot of sense coming from a pathological liar of a chameleon).Admittedly, the glorious animation and large worldbuilding is probably because J. Depp was busy shooting PoTC4 (first one not directed by Gore Verbinsky), so y'know, probably one of the last super indepth worlds we get, since movies like Minions has like 18M budget, and then makes over a billion goddamned dollars.

Definitely Has That Chameleon Feel to It.,"Highly impressive animated feature which is tame enough for the youngsters and surprisingly entertaining and thought-provoking for adults. A young chameleon (voiced pricelessly by Johnny Depp) is accidentally thrown into a town of dirt which is in desperate need of a sheriff. Oblivious to the politics of the town, there seems to be a group trying to control the city's water supply (which of course is needed by the town's inhabitants for survival). Shades of some of the more interesting live-action westerns of the years past and even Roman Polanski's contemporary classic ""Chinatown"" as under-rated director Gore Verbinski creates a cartoon that has depth and ingenuity ala Walt Disney's earliest feature-length ventures or newer productions like ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" and the ""Toy Story"" series of films.

Rango Is Not For Young Children,"Rango is a western that just happens to star animated animals instead of humans. Little kids wouldn't care for westerns, and shouldn't be taken to them for reasons of violence, and they will not find the subject matter interesting.The same logic can be applied here as well.I took my 6 year old daughter to see Rango today, and it became apparent within 5 minutes of the movie that this would not be the ideal film for her, or any other young children. The entire time the movie was playing, kids were talking, barely laughing, and many were obviously bored. It's difficult to summarize quickly what was 'bad' about Rango because it's difficult to do.The Goodthe animation is absolutely top-notch, picture perfect and beautiful - Johnny Depp and other actors did a great job with their performances, probably due to the unique way lines were recorded - tons of inside jokes that referenced other movies (I love the Fear & Loathing In Las Vegas moment)The Badthe story will bore any young child in no time flat, they just won't like it - most laughs are from the inside jokes, I can't remember the theater laughing strongly at any moment - the language is not good for a kid movie; others have complained about ""hell"" being used over and over again, I was unhappy that ""damn"" was used at the end for no good reasonFor adults I recommend Rango but just barely. The story 'should' work better, but there is no clear flow to the film. It feels jagged and rough around the edges, and just doesn't grab you. If you appreciate animation for what it is, then I can lay 5 stars on this. It's a treat for the eyes and will no doubt get you to say ""wow"" several times.I expected a lot more from this movie and it didn't deliver. If the target audience truly is little kids, then higher ups should have intervened long ago. If the audience was adults, then I guess the end result is good, but it's a shame the animation effort was used on a movie that just doesn't hit any home runs.***",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
This is the Proper Use of George Lucas' ILM,"As much as I loathed the Star Wars I-III Fiascos, because of overbloated CGI and No Substance, I LOVE this moovie for the same reason. Not because of ""No Substance"" - There IS substance here. There is a Cleverly Written by John Logan story which was fleshed out by some very good Computer animators - Possibly the same ones that worked on SW: Episodes I-III except that their services were good and proper HERE. The characters were brought to life by incredible Voice Talents: Johnny Depp, Abigail Breslin, Isla Fisher, Ned Beatty - Alfred Molina - and the great Bill Nighy - And many many more.This movie works like Warner Brothers cartoons from the 30's through the 60's worked. It works cos it is a nod to Directors like Chuck Jones and I Freleng. Early Hanna-Barbera (Not Later H-B). Walter Lantz. it is a nod to over 70 years of Cartoon Cleverness.THIS kind of movie is what the CGI is for-It's an artistic Medium. Meaning, Gore Verbinski used it as a Palette and Paint Brush.Because, it does not pander to little Kids. Movies (Star Wars I-III) that are designed to (Star Wars I-III) accommodate little kids (Star Wars I-III) always end up being insulting to the same kids (And to the adults who bring the kids). It's because all of the best cartoons were made to be funny for ADULTS.And that is what we have here, a cartoon made to amuse adults, made funny for adults, and enjoyable by adults. Except for one problem: It is not a cartoon.It is - I don't Know what it is! It's not a Movie is it? Except that it was put onto film and run in Theatres... But it was not MADE on any film medium. This was all done on the best computers using the cleverest programmers and most talented animators in their respective fields. But FILM it is Not - More like ""Computer Created Entertainment.""This CGI cartoon references other top hitters like Chinatown (water theft), and the appearance of CGI Clint Eastwood as the ""Spirit of the West"" in a scene that mirrors a scene from Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End- This film - I don't know what else to call it because this is not really a film. It's all Digital, but it was shown in Movie Theatres. Well, this Huge Computer Environment-Based Entertainment which was SHOWN in Theatres, made fun out of all kinds of movies that were made on Film.And that is what makes it great. It's a new direction for animation. Because it's not impossible imagery blended in with real life action and actors... It is completely imaginary... Which makes it real in a sense.In a way, it is film, because some of the animations used Motion Capture techniques - Some direct motion capture, and other keyframe animations that were created alongside an actor's filmed movements. So, it was all character driven, Just like Gollum in Lord of the Rings - But now, instead of just one character being CGI, they all are. And believable too-Because of the shunning of Symmetry. Even Bug's Bunny's face as perfectly symmetrical in those old cartoons, but here, Rango's face is like Johnny Depp's face - A Human face, even though Rango is a Lizard, Non- Symmetrical. And also with the other Lizards, Mice, Field rats, Foxes, Turtles, and Clit Eastwoods that were in this...

Here comes a pretty decent animation,"Coming from the director of the first Pirates of the Caribbean, and equipped with the talented voice acting of Johnny Depp, Rango is a wonderful animation movie.Rango is a pet Chameleon who is ordinary and very lonely without any goals of life. He accidentally ends up in the Mojave Desert at a time where the town of 'Dirt' faces a water crisis. With his good old acting skills and all sorts of made up heroic stories, Rango fits in to the community better than he expected and becomes the new sheriff in town. And as the water crisis becomes worse and the water bank is robbed the duty calls for desperate actions from his part. Now he has to capture the water thieves and a reveal a plot behind this all to control the water supply of Dirt in order to control power.The quality of animation is commendable. It starts pretty decent and then ends up being quite extravagant. The whole wild west look and feel of the movie get a good boost with the music and the story telling set of owls appearing here and there with some good lines.The plot is itself is quite creative. Though at times it's a bit predictable I liked the characters and how each of them plays their decent part in it. And there are some animation challenging action sequences which is pulled out very well.And as Rango says 'I couldn't help but notice you noticing me noticing you'.

Great...,"This is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. This is what any family movie is supposed to be - a movie that can entertain an adult as well as it can entertain a kid. There is a great story. There are great characters. There is great animation... Well, you get it. I am probably going to write about it in details after I write the things that I started writing this review for.Now...Well, as I've said, this is a great family movie. Really. Kids enjoy it. Adults enjoy it. However there is surprisingly huge amount of reviews and comments written by people who think this movie is somehow inappropriate for kids. Some people think it is heavily loaded with extreme violence, heavy profanity and a lot of references to nudity. I would like to respond to those people.First, about the violence... People, what world have you been living in? Seriously... What is your kids' favorite fairy tale? Is it the one about the wolf who eats a little girl and her grandmother and then gets violently killed? (Little Red Riding Hood) Or may be it is the one about the evil queen who sends her step daughter to die in the forest and then tries to kill her many times? (Snow White) Or about the woman who treats her step daughter like a piece of cr@p and then forces her real daughters to cut their toes off? (Cinderella) Or may be it is one of the thousands fairy tales about The Brave Hero who slays many enemies, kills anyone who stands in his way, etc... And what is your kids' favorite cartoon? Is it the one about the mouse who likes hitting the cat with a frying pan or other weapons of this kind so hard so the cat would surely die if it weren't a cartoon? Or may be it is the one about the carrot-eating rabbit who likes to do similar things to the hunter? Or... Whatever, you get the point. 'Rango' isn't more violent than any of these cartoons and fairy tales. If you or your kids have any problems with the violence in it then you are just insane.Second, about the profanity... I am not going to write much about it. All I am going to say is that if you feel offended by words like ""hell"" or ""private parts"", then you might find this movie filled with profanity. That is about the heaviest language you would hear in it, and it is not used in the context that would make it sound offensive. Nothing more. Nothing your 2+ year old kids haven't heard in the kindergarten. If you have problems with it then you are just insane.Third, about the references to nudity... Yes, there are a few. Rango talks to a broken Barbie doll and asks her one question. That is it. Oh, yes, and one character says something about some fruits. Nothing heavier than Daffi Duck's whistling after any beautiful girl he sees.***Now I want to write a few words about the movie itself. First, the quality of the animation. Six words - the best I have ever seen. Seriously. Everything is so amazingly detailed so it looks REAL... I wouldn't say it is the most beautiful because beauty is a very subjective thing but the details are...Second, the story and the characters. 'Rango' is some kind of a ""multi-layered"" movie. You can see it as a homage to various movies. You can see it as a movie about finding yourself. You can see it as a satire of the actors' work. And would be right about everything. The characters are exactly what they have to be. I don't want to spoil the movie so I would not write a lot of details but... Well... Every single character is important to the story, including the owls with the music instruments that you saw in the trailer. Every single character is an individual and not a simple plot-device. Every single character is great.The music is great too.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Rango Review by Brian!,"On Saturday I was able to see a screening of the new movie Rango. This movie is directed by Gore Verbinski (Pirates Trilogy, The Weather Man) and stars Johnny Depp along side an all- star cast.The plot is as follows""Rango is a pet chameleon who lives in a terrarium. He has long thought himself a hero, but then finds himself removed from his contemporary American southwest surroundings and ending up in an Old West town called Dirt, which is populated by various desert critters garbed like characters out of a Western. As he's always thought himself a hero, Rango establishes himself as the lawman, strolling the streets as a sheriff-like character. Unknown to him, the ""good guy"" role does not do very well in Dirt, with a cemetery filled with good- guy tombstones. But that does not stop Rango from trying, constantly seeking to fit in with his surroundings. In ""an existential crisis"", Rango comes to question everything about himself.""This being an animated movie I have to start by talking about the animation. I was absolutely floored by how good this movie looked. It may be the best animated/CG movies I have seen to date. They even put most of Pixar's movies to shame. After seeing it I did a little bit of research about who did the animation; it turns out it was done by the geniuses at ILM (Industrial Light & Magic). Normally ILM is just a Visual Effects company, this being their first animated feature. Let me say, they knocked it out of the park! The landscape, the character design, and every little detail, down to the amazing fur of the creatures. At some points I could not even believe that I was watching and animated movie.But the story is still the most important part of a movie, unless of course if you are Michael Bay (Rimshot). The story is about Rango who comes into an old west town where they are almost out of water. Rango impresses the town and becomes the Sheriff. He then promises to get the people more water and save their town. While this sounds like a basic plot or easy to follow movie, I have to say regardless of this being an animated movie, or how it is marketed, this is in no way a kid's movie to me. Right off the bat they are throwing around very adult oriented humor.Depp as a whole does a fun job and sounds like he is having fun with the role. If I had to narrow it down I would say Depp is playing Raoul Duke and Jack Sparrow rolled into one, maybe even a little ""Sands"" from Once Upon a Time in Mexico. All that means Depp is quite ""zany"" throughout this movie, which is the best kind of Depp. Honestly I love the character of Jack Sparrow and Depp so I really don't get tired of this. Depp always seems like he is having fun and its why I really don't mind (and am even looking forward to) a fourth Pirates. (Quiet all you naysayers!)The rest of the cast is good as well, which includes Isla Fisher, Bill Nighy, Abigail Breslin, Alfred Molina, Ray Winston, & a fantastically fun bit from Timothy Olyphany. Bill Nighy stands out as the mostly memorable role as a villainous snake. His role is short, but Nighy has a great voice for a villainA quick small item that I wanted to point out, as a huge movie nerd, I greatly appreciated the appreciable amount of meta jokes. Another one of Depp's characters makes a little cameo. Then quite possibly the greatest western hero of all time makes a great cameo and speech. (Any guesses?)In the end I enjoyed the movie and had a fun time with it. It's an old tale that we have seen done before, but the animation, actors, using animals instead of humans give this a good modern day twist. This is actually quite the good date night movie. Girls will find it cute and the guys will have enough fun with all the inside humor and adult jokes. Not that it's negative but I would still not call this a kid's movie. I think kids could see it and have fun, but some of the movies charm and special quirks would most likely be lost on them. I would still just see this movie for the amazing animation - ILM always knocks it out of the park!In the end a good 7 out of 10 / BThank you as always and enjoy the movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Sorry, can't help it. But yeah, when i went to go see this movie with my brother, we were both surprised on how dark it was. The images were pretty gruesome, the humor was a little lacking, and it has a habit of swearing a lot in it. But only the basic ""hell"" and ""damn"", nothing else. It's actually quite an accomplishment to make this a kids movie, because it's not, even for Nickalodian studios standards.

Westest western movie in Animation,"With strong hints of good old western movies, one starts wondering if they are watching a movie by Nickelodeon or Sergio Leone. With background score as close as it can be to genre and a cameo by ""The man with no name"" you can't resist liking the movie. Run time is a wee bit longer or so it may seem due to the story.Movie starts with our Hero in the middle of drama scene and ends with a action sequence & takes you to a range of levels in between.

Our Hero tries to introduce a bit of romance now and then but is taken by other ""important"" problems at hand.All in all a good movie to watch if you like westerns and wish to see and animated for that matter.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Wow, a Western that didn't suck!","Not being a fan of Westerns, having been bored by a film in the last year that even introduced aliens into the mix and still not capturing my attention, you can imagine my tentativeness to sit through ""Rango."" However, I was surprisingly impressed by the oddness of it all.""Rango,"" a film clearly more directed at adults more than children, is an amusing look at a chameleon named Lars who is mistakenly dropped off a car in the middle of the desert who finds himself in Dirt, a stereotypical Western town in the middle-of-nowhere. Fearing the lawlessness of the town, a convenient lie enraptures Lars in a heroic quest to find water for the town before it dries up completely after a faked act of heroism leads the townsfolk to believe he is Rango, fearless and worthy of being town sheriff.After a few missteps by Johnny Depp, who voices the titular character, he finally found an entertaining way to deliver his almost-too-obvious quirkiness of late.Still not on the level of some of the great animated features of the last twenty years, ""Rango,"" which won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, is definitely the best offering the genre had to offer in 2011. Hell, if it won this Western-hating sceptical over, John Logan's script must have done something right, if not Gore Verbinski's wonderful direction.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"perfect characters, perfect soundtrack perfect animation, perfect story and perfect movie","Rango in many ways exceeds Pixar animation, the characters are very distinctive and, although they are cartoony, they are incredibly well done, the scales, fur or feathers of the characters are so full of details that they look like real animals, The whole casting does an amazing job with the characters, especially Bill Nighy as Rattlesnake Jake, which is without a doubt my favorite part of the movie, the movie tells the story of Rango, a lying hero trying to help the citizens of a small Animal town, the story has breathtaking action scenes.

"Ok, so this was indeed better than expected.","There's no denying 'Rango' is a most unusual animated film. It doesn't have the typical storyline, characters or humor most animated films have. This is what made 'Rango' so exciting.A pet chameleon's life becomes a quest for survival when the car he travels in swerves for an Armadillo, throwing him from the car. Rango soon finds himself in a town called Dirt, where the water has suddenly disappeared. After a heroic deed, Rango is assigned sheriff and must try to solve the water mystery. In the process he would become the most unlikely of heroes.I must be honest I didn't find the first few minutes very funny, or all that interesting for that matter. It was cute in places, but also bland in others. However, around the midway mark, it became very exciting and quite thrilling, actually, with lots of action and fast-paced sequences. The animation is stunning, as was the score. 'Rango' turned out to be a clever way of conveying a very important message.

New Coat of Paint on the Old West,"""Rango"" is a 2011 animated film directed by Gore Verbinski and produced by Nickelodeon. It won the Best Animated Picture Oscar, snapping Pixar's 4-year winning streak. The story follows a pet Gecko, played by Johnny Depp, who crash lands in an old west animal town. After some hijinks, he calls himself Rango, and assumes the role of Sheriff.The setting of the old west is a fun location, and it is criminally underused for animation. The only other major release I can think of is ""An American Tail: Fievel Goes West"" back in 1991. The animation in this film is very good. The animators had the voice cast act out the scenes, and then used their actions as reference for their scenes. The animation style matches the old west tone very well. There is a grit and grime to the visuals, as if the whole thing has a layer of dirt on it.The villains are a good level of intimidating. This movie has an edge to it that you don't find in many modern animated films. Our hero is likable enough. He sees himself as an actor, he commits himself in the role and just gets in over his head. All the supporting cast are just the right level of strange to make them memorable. The movie can be very funny when it wants to be, but it can also animate a very intense action scene.The downside for the movie is its story. The movie follows the same tired clichés we have seen a dozen times too many. And it isn't even the cool western tropes, I'm talking about the usual kids' movie formula. The villain's motivation and scheme are predictable. And the third act drama, even a 5-year old, could see it coming from a mile away. This wouldn't be so bad if they did something new or clever with the concept. Or even if they were able to blow by the plot points really quick. But no, the movie lingers on them for far too long.As a whole, the characters and animation give the film a fresh look, but it is still a tired and cliched story. If you've been to this neck of the woods before, I say ride on. But if you're new to all this, then I say saddle up.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A disappointment,"STORY: 8.6/10VISUAL: 7.9/10ACTING: 9.9/10HUMOR: 4/10ENTERTAINMENT: 6/10First of all, I must give it some credit, as, well, it was a pretty good film. Many of my friends loved it.The film was directed by Gore Verbinski, and I praise much of his work for Pirates of the Carribian. I've read that he says himself that 'Rango is not a kids film - it just happens to have earned a PG rating'. With this in mind, I was glad to expect something as grand as pirates with a great story, great action, great ideas, and GOOD humor as opposed to senseless jokes to get the kids laughing.Well, when I saw it, it DID INDEED seem like a kid's film. Many things were unrealistic, and just overall pointless. The singing owls were annoying, and BEANS, Isla Fisher's character, put me to sleep and was annoying herself.The film would go on and on, my rating dropping every minute. When I left the theater, I was at a 5/10. A disappointment for Gore Verbinski.HOWEVER: if it were not a Gore Verbinski film, and perhaps a film of a young, average kids film director, I would greatly praise it and give it a 8/10. For a Verbinski film, it's 5/10. For a film in general, I'd say a 6/10.Also, it'd be best to be an adult when you watch this, as there are many parodies of films the kids definitely can't see yet. However, the 'kid' quality of it pulls down the adult enjoyment, leaving the film for a half kid, half man type person.I recommend you see it, as you might like it. Just be aware of what you are looking for.P.SHans Zimmer's score is brilliant! Purchase his 'Rango Suite'!",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A cartoon version of the ""Man with no name"" movies of Clint Eastwood. Not as good as those, not really for kids. I say C-","""I can't survive in the desert, I don't belong here."" After falling out of his car and becoming lost on the side of the road, Rango (Depp) meets Bean (Fisher) and after a few careful lies becomes sheriff on the town. When all the town's water goes missing it is up to him to help find it and bring it back. Since this is a kids movie this will be a short review. I thought was very slow moving and a little boring. This does not really work as a kids cartoon. The opening scene will appeal to them, but the movie then becomes a full on western in the vane of ""The Man With No Name"" movies starring Clint Eastwood. Very little action and a drawn out story line make this a little too adult for kids. My eight year old loved the first half-hour, then got really bored and went to play outside. My two year old who loves ""Toy Story"" and pretty much and cartoon was very disinterested in this. I did finish it to see how it ended, but that's the only reason. Overall, not a very good kids movie, adults may like this more then kids, I did not. I give it a C-.Would I watch again? - No, I barely made it through once.*Also try - Nine",,Anonymous,Animation

Now, if I surpass my hatred for the rats and reptiles etc. These filthy creatures also make this movie unique and amusing. After The Ring & Pirates trilogy, Gore Verbinski impresses us with his direction again.

Simple,"I had been looking forward ""Rango""'s premiere for a long time. I was expecting it in 3D, but if the film is very good, 3D is not a big deal. This film is first of all for the western lovers. It tells fantastic story of a little chameleon, who happened to be thrown in the middle of the desert. He founds a village (ranch), where he meets new friends and new enemies instead of his past friends: clockwork fish and a half-bodied mannequin of a girl. The first part of the film is devoted to the Rango's handling with new environment, his making new friends. The main events of the film are happening in desert, where the main squad of ""good"" heroes, headed by Rango trying to find some water for their thirst village. I find this part some kind of boring. There is a part similar to the large quantity of films: chases, fights etc. I would like to distinguish the ugliness and visual enormity of all of the heroes in the movie. While the other studious are trying to do their characters funny and amusing, here we see almost vomitive heroes notwithstanding the Rango only. As for me, Rango was one only hero, who was making fun and entertaining the public. There are present some adult jokes, lame and odd, no one of the audience was laughing. I may mark a nice music accompaniment by the Mexican owls, they where pleasant and funny. So, this film deserves for attention, but there are a lot of better animations. It's very unusual for the minute, but I can't say lucky unusual. I was expecting more.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Giving a two is being generous.... Odd, and the comedy was the only good thing about it","This movie, to say the least, is the strangest thing I have ever seen. I went to see this movie, expecting a cute, fun, kid movie. I was sadly disappointed.There are no fun kid aspects of this movie besides the comedy. The content is at times a little... well, not exactly ""vulgar"" but at the same time not kid-friendly. There are uses of the d-word and the h-word, and scary face offs at times. There was drinking, and smoking.At times I could not figure out WHAT IN THE WORLD was going on. I think that some parts were too western for me and just turned odd. I can't describe it in words.There WERE some funny aspects, like the owls, and some occasional jokes. Though, that was as far as the comedy went, really.Take my advice, run to ""The Other Side of the Street"" and AVOID this movie. I did not find it very much entertaining.

An intelligent animation western that partially fulfilled it's potential.,"Rango (voiced by Johnny Depp) is an ordinary chameleon who ends up in the town of Dirt, a lawless outpost in the Wild West who are looking for a new sheriff and Rango fulfils that position. The occupants of the town have little water which is obviously essential to their survival and of what there is, is stolen from the bank so Rango with the help of various townsfolk goes to retrieve it back.Overall this is an intelligent movie with plenty of western pastiche and parodies that is referenced. But this is part of the problem, the movie becomes too intelligent and a bit self indulgent in wanting to cram in so many western references and as a result I just don't think this is a movie many kids will enjoy or anyone who has seen many westerns like me. And as a result for me though it was funny in parts and I chuckled now and again there just wasn't enough laughs for me really and it felt dragged out at certain points. At a hundred minutes it was a bit too long. If they cut off ten minutes and included more laughs instead of so many references my rating of this would have been higher. And whilst I'm still going on the negatives you enjoy watching the characters but don't end up emotionally connecting with them not like in Up or in any of the Toy Story films. And it did start off a bit boring and slow. But it does pick up when Rango enters Dirt Town.However at the risk of sounding so negative there was plenty other things in this film that I admired, which made me enjoy it. Though not as big on laughs, the script is witty and crackles with sharpness making it a joy throughout. The voice-over acting was superb across the cast. Johnny Depp was good as the voice of Rango, but the best ones were Isla Fisher as the voice of Beans (who gave an excellent wild west accent) and I really enjoyed Bill Nighy's turn as the voice of rattlesnake Jake. It is superbly well shot and edited by director Gore Verbinski. Surprisingly the action sequences are very entertaining, which did to some extent make up for some of the lack of comedy. But the best thing was the animation, which looked absolutely gorgeous to visualise it, particularly in digital. I also highly admire Gore Verbinski's decision not to add this in 3D, though it can be extremely well done in films and animations like Up, Rango just proves you don't need 3D to enjoy the visual animation. I also like Verbinki's creativeness at trying something different. A western animation as far as I am aware isn't very common, which makes it quite original.In the end though Rango didn't completely fulfil it's potential as it is a bit too self indulgent I enjoyed it thoroughly and can certainly see why this has been such a huge hit with audiences. The 7.8 IMDb rating on here is I feel about right. This is worth seeing if your an adult or have a fondness for the western genre. Rango is overall an intelligent animation that is worth a watch and despite it flaws it deserves high praise and it is one of the most original animations to come out in recent years. Very enjoyable entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Smart, witty, satirical, hip, ""Rango"" is a hit","*** out of (****)After the plethora of abysmal, Hollywood-glossed 3D animation productions, I thought a sleeper hit of such genre would never make its comeback. Boy was I wrong. Rango is an oddball of a movie, a hipster one you could say. It's an animated film that hits all the right notes, and hits those notes hard. Pixar has definitely got competition on their hands. For once, a kids film isn't in the third dimensions. Don't get me wrong, the fad played its course, and I had fun with it, but 3D has overstayed its welcome a bit. What next? ""Precious 2... in 3D!"". However, regardless of what reviewers say, this film isn't certainly for everyone. In fact, I hardly think this is a kids movie. With subtle sexual one-liners, and bits of profanity sprinkled here and there, it seems more mature. Not to mention its sophisticated, dry-pan humor. However, if you get this film, it's just all that much better. And apparently, most people got it.Rango revolves around the namesake protagonist who has been escorted from a vehicle, and has his feet planted on the other hot, western part of the city. There, Rango tries to assimilate in his new place by becoming a hero. However, the city is suffering from a drought, and Rango may have a few obstacles in his way. Can Rango still be a hero? Will the drought be gone? Will the townspeople have someone to count on?Yes, I'm fully aware you can answer those questions faster than Lindsay Lohan can try to cover up her sanity, but this film isn't about the twists and turns. It's about the ride. Let's talk about acting chops. Everyone here is exceptional in their role, especially Depp. Depp just has that charisma and undeniable wit, which makes his character that much stronger. Fisher can sass and charm into just about anything. She's definitely something. As for the rest, they play their characters respectively well. I'm not one to complain. Furthermore, the script is very hip. The jokes are very intelligent, hit every demographic, and pull a strong punch. To put the cherry on top, on a technical level, ""Rango"" shines. The animation is just so immersing, and I can slip into the picture. Also, I love just how much fun this movie is. The western vibe, the slick action, the line delivery of jokes. It's just all good.While this is a fine piece of filmmaking, there's a few bumps in the road. For one, the movie takes a while to get going. The opening twenty or so minutes is just very dry and ""Rango"" doesn't find its footing. It does when its about mid-way, but picks up momentum as it progresses. Furthermore, I think the film tried too hard in some areas, and too little in others. Also, is it just me or is this movie long? I enjoyed the film but my god, it just never ended. There were at least four times I thought it would end, and there'd be ten more minutes.All in all, ""Rango"" is an odd fellar. It has some gaps to fill, but the ride is still moving. It's entertaining, fresh, cool. Seek out a matinée, at least. Even if the film doesn't quench your acquired taste, the technical aspect of it certainly will. Smart, witty, satirical, hip, ""Rango"" is a hit.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Hit that's amiss,"I began to like the film right away. I was expecting to be delighted with all the amazing animation greatly enhanced by the stellar cast and a funny and heartwarming story. The opening scene with the adorable owls promised something good to come. I settled down in my seat and cracked open my large bag of Corn Nuts. The introduction of the title character, Rango the Camelion, followed suit. The poor little guy was suddenly ripped from his imaginary idyllic environment with the humans and thrust into the grave dangers of the real world. Then something happened. Thump. The film that had started out like Bullet Bob Hayes running a down and out then, unfortunately, slowed down like an old man out for a 50 foot jog in the park.As the film meandered along it became increasingly hard for me to maintain interest. That surprised me coming as it did from the same people responsible for a number of great action films. Maybe story boarding may have helped. Maybe having a bit of assistance from someone – anyone – more experienced in creating animated films may have helped. Perhaps they felt Pete Docter was too pricey. Having no one was more costly yet.Speaking as a trained artist, the animation itself is a masterpiece of the genre. At times, it's hard to believe some of the things you are seeing on screen are animation; it's that realistic. That was the best saving grace of the film, it gave me something of considerable interest to study during the too frequent sluggish stretches.I expected some visually stunning characters coming from the genius of Industrial Light and Magic. I was to be disappointed. I got the feeling that no one was in charge of the store, so the employees were skateboarding down the aisles.The ""star"" of the trailers and the film is a quirky chameleon. That would make one expect some similarly adorable co-stars. Not so much. Whoever was responsible for character design seems to have come from a dark place they shouldn't have left.Virtually none of the films characters, except for perhaps the mariachi owl quartet, are what one could call endearing enough to make action figures from. I get the feeling the designers thought they were creating characters who would be offbeat in a quirky, oddly funny sort of way. Instead, they created an ensemble for a theater of the bizarre, unsightly bordering on the grotesque. A film peopled with a few such characters can be interesting for the counter-point they often times offer. But having all the characters like that is just uncomfortably unsightly. Compounding the felony, they chose for the film's setting one of the more unappealing areas of the world; the sparsest parts of the Southwestern American desert. I understand that they felt it gave some degree of credence to the single plot element. In retrospect, they may have been better served, and in so doing better serve the filmgoing public, by having a look at how-to-write-a-book-now.com and then develop a plot set in a more appealing area of the world.Some of the character's disquieting appearance might have been counter-balanced by other endearing qualities but, alas, such was not to be.Beyond their appearance, the Western accents the actors tried to emulate with most of the dialog fell short of actually being intelligible in places. One might tend to blame that sort of studied mumbling on the actors going a smidgen too far in trying to satirize those sorts of characters; but I'd lay the blame on the director's doorstep as it's his responsibility for that sort of thing appearing in the film. In any event, it fell flat. Perhaps it'd be better with subtitles.The actors, without exception, turned in solid performances. Johnny Depp was in fine form as the title character's voice and complimented by Isla Fisher as the the strange lizard girl afflicted with petit mal seizures. Ned Beatty, Abigale Breslin, Timothy Olyphant, Alfred Molina and Harry Dean Stanton contribute their usual quality work. And, lets not forget Bill Nighy as the nasty snake. But for all their effort one cannot get past the meager material they're given to work with. Listening to them deliver the material is better than the overall film.I had the nagging feeling that this film developed with a few well-meaning guys over a couple of beers who had worked together before and thought their little joke was hilarious and then muscled the funding for this as some sort of requite for previous successes. That thought congealed with recognition of scenes that appeared to have been designed for 3D. The fact that the film is not in 3D may be a tacit admission from the makers that they are aware they missed the mark with this one.Lastly, there's a sparsity of elements to hold the attention of children; who are usually the target demographic for animated films. There were children in the theater and I could tell they weren't entertained by all the noise they were making.By Bruce L. Joneshttp://webpages.charter.net/bruce.jones1/",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Frustrating, boring, odd, scary, slow and difficult to watch in places","Imagine the plot and story board meetings when this movie was created.Lets make it animated, everyone loves animation. Let's get Johnny Depp to voice the main part, everyone loves Johnny.Let's make Johnny's character a chameleon who pretends to be a gunslinger in a town that has run out of water. Lets make all the supporting characters very odd animals with weird character traits and deformities, all highlighted with hyper realistic animation. Oh and lets make one of the characters have an arrow through his eye, in place for most of the later scenes.Somebody at the back might also add, lets remove most of the humour and have some very odd lines - ""I found some human spine in my fecal matter"" and lets make the theme of the plot something only adults might even begin to comprehend.Lets get some things straight, the animation, voice work and characterizations are a joy. But and this is a massive but, who is the film aimed at. It would be financial suicide to make an expensive animated film about strange animals just for adults, wouldn't it? The whole film is peppered with surreal moments but involves a chameleon attempting to save a town from assorted bad guys voiced by Bill Nighy and Ned Beatty. This all transpires in the town of ""Dirt"", a spaghetti western town with no water, apparently exclusively populated and terrorized by characters straight from ""Deliverance"", the animated version.We have mystical surreal sequences, very long words, high decibel classical music (Ride of the Valkyries), an owl Los Lobos group and plays within plays. All of the above, in Disney fashion, book ended by massive chase sequences, all thrown together in a gigantic mashup on the screen.There are long periods of boredom, Ray Winstone picks the film up but then promptly disappears again. We gradually drag ourselves to a grand finale but it is a very long time coming and many will not worry or care too much about the outcome.There are numerous in jokes but it would appear the film makers, director Gore Verbinski of ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" fame, have way too many ideas. Normally 20% would make it into the movie, here everything is on the screen and it is not pretty or easy to watch.The young audience in this reviewers screening seemed very confused and remained resolutely quiet, not a good sign. The film is likely to be too scary for young children with some very inappropriate images for a film presumably aimed at youngsters - owl characters in nooses ready to be hanged.... anyone laughing at the back.Pixar have little to worry about here apart from the almost photo realistic animation, hang that on a decent story aimed at a particular audience, then maybe the famous Pixar angle poise light might start to tremble, just a bit.SummaryFrustrating, boring, odd, scary, slow and difficult to watch in places, all words not desirable in a summary for an animated film for younger people.Difficult to recommend to any audience, especially young children, despite stellar animation and great voice acting.http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.com/",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
"The CGI animation is solid and truly fantastic, everything else was just okay","After seeing the first trailer of this cgi animated movie, I didn't really have a big hype for it nor did I know what the movie is about. After watching it, I can safely say it really did not meet my expectations. Now I know what style and direction it was trying to go but overall it just wasn't all that effective. The movie also seems to be all over the place sometimes and not in a good way either. There just wasn't the development to care what goes on all that much, I just didn't care for any of the characters in this movie and what happens to them. And like I said I didn't know much about this movie and didn't expect it to be a wacky CGI animated western or a semi-western movie for kids and adults. I will say the movie did have it's moments although I never heard the word ""water"" so many times in a movie before. And the CGI animation is spectacular and amazing to watch, the quality of the CGI animation really is top notch in this. The voice actors did a really good job as well, didn't expect much from Johnny Depp in this but he pulled it off really well. Bill Nighy did a good job as Rattlesnake Jake the antagonist as well and really stood out. Overall the animation is solid and very detailed, it was truly amazing to see the CGI animation on the big screen but as for the direction and story. I could tell what what it was trying to do but wasn't fully effective. Maybe if the movie was a bit more witty at least I would have given it a higher rating.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Bill Nighy was perfect for Rattlesnake Jake, this absolute badass of villain. He looked badass, he sounded badass, he was a full-on badass. Isla Fisher as Beans was excellent; she knows how to do a convincing southern accent and it sounded great. Everyone else (Ray Winstone, Ned Beatty, etc) did an excellent job portraying their characters and portraying them well. Also, all the action sequences were amazing. The fight over getting the water jug was entertaining and hilarious, as well as the scene with Jake shooting down all the bats; it looked awesome. Also, Hans Zimmer never ceases to amaze me with his score. He did amazing with Pirates of the Caribbean and the Dark Knight Trilogy, and he doesn't fail to amaze with the score with this movie. I also really love the banter between all the characters (especially Rango and Jake), and how they constantly interacted and how that would change throughout the film. There's nothing for me to criticize with this movie. I am for sure giving Rango an ""A+"". If you've never seen this movie or have never thought about seeing it, please do. You wont regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Rango is a masterfully written western revival,"Getting separated from his owners as they drive through the desert, aspiring thespian chameleon Rango finds himself in Dirt, a small ""Wild West"" town that is suffering from a drought that is suspected to be caused by a conspiracy. Knowing that he is a stranger in these parts, Rango creates himself an entire new life (including the name Rango) that makes him into a heroic outlaw and lands him as the town's new sheriff. With gritty and masterful writing, Rango comes to life as homage to the classic western with themes and humor that play well with the adult crowd, but of course featuring light-hearted slapstick styled material to allow the younger viewers to have some fun. With great animation an entire ensemble of characters comes into existence before our eyes, using a new technique of ""emotion capture"" where the actors actually performed each scene rather than standing in a studio just recording their voices. Johnny Depp is so far gone into his charismatic yet insecure character of Rango, giving him a real heart and soul to carry as the film's protagonist. Other characters are portrayed by Isla Fisher, Ned Beatty, Abigail Breslin and a menacingly vicious performance by Bill Nighy. For his first animated feature, I think Gore Verbinski has done a wonderful job at bringing an alteration of a classic tale, one that is a rarity in films today. From its great writing to its strong performances, this is a film anyone will enjoy with a geniusly incorporated reference to a previous Depp film, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, and capturing the true ""spirit of the west"".",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A proper Western,"Rango is wild. It's not an animated family friendly riff on the Western, it is a Western. All the classic tropes are accounted for in a story of capitalism at its most cruel with duels at high noon and big speeches about how the outlaw is a dying breed as modernity encroaches. It just also happens to be a really funny and wildly inventive animated movie.Johnny Depp is a natural at voice acting. There's so much life to his performance and from moment one it's clear that Rango won't be a Jack Sparrow imitation or him just using his regular voice. It's a performance within a performance as he has to fake a level of confidence he really doesn't have to survive in such an unforgiving landscape.Gore Verbinksi proves he's one of those rare directors who can swap between live action and animation without losing any of his recognisable sensibilities. The set pieces are epic and genuinely thrilling plus the film has the same boundary pushing nature (for a PG) as his work on the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, especially with the gnarly character designs.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Nickleodeon are great aren't they?,"When you see the turtle in his wheelchair on top of a tall wooden podium with only steep steps up to it you think - this is just a film, why would descriptive things be important, the story doesn't matter on the reality of it. Right. Then you see them all go in a tunnel and explore past something with a big eye, what is it? What's that got to do with the story? Nothing. Ha ha. Then they come out of the tunnel and then get on their 'horses', which weren't in the tunnel with them. But what has that got to do with the story? Nothing. It starts of on a freeway, and the chameleon is 'freed' - only to become part of a gang which is being ripped off and supplying water to a human city, even though they are 'animals' - which has got nothing to do with the story so why am I whining on about it? This sort of nonsense happens a lot in this film, the writing is appalling - 'everyone needs to believe in something' - well, I 'believe' this movie is a massive piece of actual crap. Hurray for rubbish! Pixars UP! a fantastic animated film, the story is amazing, this one? Pfffttt!",,Anonymous,Animation
"You WILL believe that Johnny Depp is a lizard, in case you didn't already.","Rango isn't a Pixar movie, but it feels like it may as well be -- state-of-the-art animation, playful creativity, overheated critical praise up to and including having an Oscar for Animated Feature in its best pocket more or less since release, a remarkable first act, and a surprising reliance on the usual plot outlines and conventions of children's movies.Rango uses the formula of the oddball pretending to be a hero, and if you've seen one of these movies (Dumbo is perhaps the most archetypical) you'll be able to see every beat coming from a mile away. But the journey is enjoyable and has some pretty amazing setpieces, which I won't spoil here. It also has a decidedly cynical sense of humour which is only eventually muted in the formulaic climax.The computer animation is top-notch, rendering a nigh-photorealistic desert and some gorgeous water effects. The distinctly odd character designs show more personality and are less realistic, which was probably a good decision. As the requisite big name star without voice acting experience, Johnny Depp gives a hyperactive and schticky performance that doesn't really suit the character. The rest of the cast acquits themselves much better, with Isla Fisher and Ned Beatty especially standing out.There's a tendency to grade these films on a curve: American critics expect little from animation and kid's movies, so when there's something of merit they overreact. The truth is, the bar has been raised for animation (and children's cinema, for that matter) a long time ago. Rango doesn't surpass that bar, but it more or less meets it. It's a formulaic diversion, but one with a lot of great moments and more than a bit of an edge to it.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
exceptional animated insanity,"Movie reviewer Roger Moore panned ""Rango"" in the Saturday March 5th Atlanta Journal Constitution. I had seen the trailer and was impressed with the spot on animation and characters, so I went anyway. I'm glad I ignored Moore's negativity. He seemed to stew in his own juices over the fact that the movie is not necessarily geared toward children. And it's not geared toward children. Who said it had to be just because it's animated? Dare I say that Rango is a great animated movie. As I said the animation is perfect. The characters are in turn cute, precious, nasty and down right ugly. I marveled at how an animator can evoke so much emotion in a computer created character with a voice. It is amazing. I must add that I did not take a small child to this movie, I'm 63, and I would not advise that others do. While some of the characters are cute and cuddly, some scenes are scary. But that's why it's rated PG. In addition the movie is funny, makes an environmental point, is at times poignant, sad, gross and hokey. And if you don't like Jonny Depp, who is the voice of Rango, don't worry you don't have to look at him and he does a credible job as a lizard. I recommend it highly.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not what I hoped it would be.,"Everyone goes to a movie with certain expectations. I expected a Great storyline in a movie starring Johnny Depp. However the story was, at times, slow. I would imagine someone told Depp to ""slow down the dialog"", probably for the children's delicate comprehension. What this movie does do well is; in your face - awesomely gruesome - computer animation detail. I don't want to spoil anything, but there were times I started feeling queasy in my stomach as I am the type to look away when passing road kill. Still okay for children though, they will probably find it funny if they can sit through the slow scenes. If bringing your kids, go to the matinée and save some money, otherwise wait for the DVD.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Magnificent,"It is with immense sadness that I eject ""Rango"" from my Blu-Ray player to send it back from whence it came. And in hindsight, I regret not making it to the theater when this was released. I spent nearly a year ignorant of the magic of this film, a time when something untoward might have happened to me and I could have left this world without having a chance to have seen it.Get the picture? Often, one can get a better idea of what is great about a film by reading the negative reviews, most of which, for Rango, consist of terrified parents who didn't pay attention to what movie ratings mean. ""PG"" means that, ""some scenes are not suitable for children"". What that actually means is, SOME SCENES ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR CHILDREN!!!!!! The movie is gritty where it needs to be gritty, coarse where it needs to be coarse, and terrifying when it intends to be terrifying...and all the more brilliant for it.Pixar does make fabulous animated films. I was overjoyed by ""Monsters, Inc"", touched by, ""Nemo"", and thrilled with, ""The Incredibles"" but Nickoldeon has financed what is surely the finest animated film of all time. All work in it is spectacular, from the tiniest details to the phenomenal voice-acting. Bill Nighy's briefly seen but essential character rates, to me, as one of the most frightening villains ever put to the screen, such was his performance. The detailing in all of the characters regarding movement, idiosyncrasies, and texture are astounding. In extreme close-up one character, speaking in great fear, has his eyes blinking appropriately to convey his feelings. But one eye, one time skips a tiny, tiny bit and executes a partial double-blink. It's barely perceptible but it conveys the effort this character is having relating his tale. It's something an actor might understand but surely not an animator? But no computer made the decision to animate it that way. That is an example of the depth to which Rango has been produced.The backgrounds, the texture and feel, the music, the classical Greek convention with a inspired Southwestern twist (you'll see) gives sharper viewers a decent idea of how deep this story will go beyond the obvious.Rarely, RARELY have I watched any film I liked a second time IMMEDIATELY after finishing it the first time but I began the second, stop-and-go-back viewing the next morning, seeing a thousand things I had missed while watching wide-eyed in the moment on the first go-round. I can imagine that the same Puritan-type parents who whisked their kids straight from the theater and hurried post-haste to post a ""don't waste..."" on IMDb about this movie are the children of those equally horrified parents who did the same (minus IMDb) when they ran screaming from ""Fritz the Cat"" in 1972 wondering what the ""X"" rating was for having probably assumed it meant ""Xtra nice for kids"".For you parents who don't know your ABC's well enough to have bothered to understand what ""PG"" means, for you, there's a big, purple, stupid dinosaur waiting to hug you. For the rest of us who bothered to pay attention, there are amazing films like Rango. Watch it once, watch it again, and marvel at the true mastery of the state-of-the-art",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Nutshell Review: Rango,"This is the story of a humble chameleon that is destined for greater things, being put on his true calling by a freak accident that got him literally thrown out the window of his comfort zone, and into the big bad real world, the canvas in which he will bungle and stumble into recognition. Director Gore Verbinski is probably well known in recent years for this Pirates of the Caribbean action adventure trilogy, and he brings that swashbuckling sense of storytelling into the animated realm with Industrial Light and Magic's maiden venture into a full length animated feature film.But to offer up some guarantees chartering into unknown waters, Verbinski brings onboard some of his pirates alumni to provide that A-list voice cast for animated characters that don't look at all a tad adorable - imagine selling a rattlesnake or a chameleon as a soft toy - providing that additional oomph that this is no run of the mill venture to test waters, but a serious attempt at great storytelling with great visuals, and its Western movie homage fires on all cylinders to bring about a rip roaring comical adventure that's suited more for the young adult and upwards demographics.There's Johnny Depp playing the titular character, a motormouth who daydreams of being a somebody, and finds that in this strange new world with the town called Dirt that he discovers in the middle of the Mojave Desert, comes an opportunity to live out his dreams of a badass with a reputation of ridding his opponents with just one bullet off his sixshooter. The townsfolks lap up all his stories when Rango accidentally finishes off one of the town's greatest predators, and got rewarded with being the new Sheriff in town. While he knows he's a complete fluke, that doesn't stop Rango from living up the attention, with deadlier foes all coming in the horizon given the food chain concept of there always being another predator just around the corner, especially with the absence of something higher up.But for those expecting a simple tale of Rango overcoming such obstacles in his path in his road to enlightenment, you'll find that expectation soundly busted with the same sense of complexity that Verbinski brings to the Pirates films, where the plot here tangents off in all possible intertwining angles, where the villains are more political and the problems faced by the town of Dirt being more macro than micro and quite contemporary too with the reminder on the scarcity of fresh water that our real world at large face, calling for attention to be paid to the plot crafted by John Logan, Gore Verbinski and James Ward Byrkit, that rewards at the end when they converge.Fans of Western films will undoubtedly identify with the myriad of homage paying moments in Rango, culminating in the appearance of the Spirit of the West (Timothy Olyphant), who without a doubt resembled one of the greatest Western characters played by Clint Eastwood in the Sergio Leone films. I thought it would be a treat if Eastwood had lent his voice, but it was not to be. Still, the voice acting of the likes of Isla Fisher, Abigail Breslin, Alfred Molina, Bill Nighy, Ned Beatty and Ray Winstone are nothing to scoff about.The animation is top notch and will give Pixar, Disney and those ahead in the game a firm run for the money. You'll feel the heat and parched landscapes of the desert, coupled with texture rich creatures created. Rango also struck a fine balance between dramatic, dialogue heavy moments with its kinetic big set action sequences, and Verbinski once again underscores his brilliance in creating a large action adventure, with one of my favourites here being the aerial and land battles midway through the film with Rango and his ragtag gang running away from adversaries who utilizes the flight of the bats as an aerial threat. Really edge of your seat, exciting stuff conjured.For those who have enough of animation dwelling on the cutesy nature pandering to the younger audiences and with that ulterior motive to sell toys, Rango will be that breath of fresh air to reinforce the notion that animation can be for adults to enjoy as well, if rightly done with the right ingredients used to tell a good story with great, zany comedy to top it all off. Highly recommended, and this strikes early gold into my shortlist of one of the best films thus far this year.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Rango (2011),"The story isn't original, but it is new to the world of animation. A western crossed with Chinatown, Rango is filled with corruption, ugly characters, and surprising violence. The one thing I loved is the animation. Finally, the characters looked original. They were detailed but cartoonish. Best of all, they were truly ugly. These characters aren't here to sell toys, they are here to inhabit the world that surrounds them. A lot of the humor comes from Rango attempting to fit into such a violent culture. This isn't the best source of humor. A wonderful voice cast lend their vocals to the animated creations, which pop out of the screen, despite being in 2D. Proving that 3D is a ridiculous and pointless piece of trash (unless used as a gimmick), when Rattlesnake Jake slithers on screen, it feels like he coming straight for you.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Corpus,"It is possible to decorate something ugly with beauty. It will still be essentially ugly, but have some attraction. Likewise, it is possible to have an ordinary movie, borrowing from others in an ordinary way, but to have some clever elaborative filmmaking.Verbinski is something of a genius at this. His charter was to make a safe cartoon, and that means you assemble from known parts. Nowhere is this more routine than in the western. So what does he do? He borrows in the open, making each one a small insider joke. There are a spectrum of these, some overt, others subtle so players at any level can enjoy.So he has to start with the notion that this thing is fractionally folded, in other words it has story bits lent from all over. This notion is conveyed by a frantic, schizophrenic introductory performance. Our main character is a chameleon, wink, wink. Even this is modeled after Robin Williams' intro from 'Aladdin.' Once the story proper begins, we have a sequence of references to prior Depp films, including one never finished ('Don Quixote'), one where the writer is the subject ('Fear and Loathing') and even his obscure Kustarica film.Having set this deeply self-referential tone, it is safe to drag in the workhorse elements of other films, tacked onto the 'Chinatown' storyline.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",,Anonymous,Animation
A good movie,This is probably one of my favorite Animated movies of recent memory. It stars Johnny Depp who plays his part very well and is quite hilarious as a lizard. The animation is amazing everything looks very sharp and very well done. The story line keeps you very interested unlike many of the animated movie they have have somewhat of a child story line this one does not.This movie is about a lizard who has an owner but while driving his cage falls out of the car and he is stranded in the desert. He finds a small town of creatures like himself and creates a new identity for himself claiming he is a roughneck gun slinger.This movie is very good and has its funny moments.

"In fact, the story is straight","In fact, the story is straight, but it must be admitted that the animation of the Emperor of the United States is decades ahead of the Chinese Empire. Today, animation still remains at the level of Impressionism and preaching. Of course, it had something to do with the peasant dynasty. The picture of the film is very realistic, not carefully compared, like a live-action movie, especially when Rango left town to walk in the desert and the end of the glorious sunset. The soundtrack is very distinctive.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Different and entertaining, but not without its flaws","'Rango' is an unusual blend of genres - there certainly aren't many animated family western movies out there. I like the idea though and thought that the western setting really added something special to the film. It's a unique visual experience that is unlikely to ever be replicated, or at least not to the same level as this one. It does have some very noticeable flaws though.The plot is adequate but lacks any real depth, which is predictable for a family movie, but even so. I also found 'Rango' to be unnecessarily long. There's no way an animated kids film with a plot as thin as this should be pushing 2 hours. Putting things into perspective though, 'Rango' is good overall. The characters are interesting and funny and the voice acting is all on point. Johnny Depp was a great choice to voice Rango and brings a lot of enthusiasm and personality to the role.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Rango,"The visuals are off-putting at first (many of the character designs are really unappealing) but do eventually provide some stunning images, particularly when the film goes down slightly surreal paths. And the story is easy enough to tag along with, although it's cobbled together from a variety of familiar sources... mostly Westerns, but oddly enough, CHINATOWN more than anything else. But the problem is that most of the humor is either ""Hey, recognize this reference?"" or the usual anthropomorphism. Look, it's animals doing things you've seen people do. I just didn't think it was funny, nor did the film have much heart to it. When it's not being predictable, it's being obnoxious (don't get me started on the potty humor). It RESEMBLES fun -- big, loud action scenes and lots of one-liners and sight gags -- but it doesn't feel fun. It's actually sort of dull. Technologically, and even stylistically, impressive. Otherwise, no thank you.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Excellent,"Rango is quite simply excellent. It takes an animated spin on the western and combines some really great dialogue as well.I have been overwhelmed lately by Depp's performances. He seems to be playing the same characters all over again (Burton films), BUT here he is simply great. The story itself is rather simple and maybe too formulaic for my tastes, but it works so well because the film has plenty of action. The amazing animation designs and the sound effects make it rousing and make it a personal favorite of mine. Definitely is going to be a stand-out when the year ends as far as animated films go.

Most Underrated Movie,"This movie is the most underrated movie I have ever seen. There is no better movie more forgotten. There is no masterpiece more underappreciated. I believe many people have watched and enjoyed this movie without actually realizing how beautiful it is, and that many more have never heard of it.Rango is a movie about identity. A movie about a chameleon who can not blend in. A goofy stranger that makes up lies about his past and prestige to hide that he has no past at all, and watches as his lies build him a cage of newfound responsibility and people who are relying on him.""Rango"" looks like a kids movie to those who aren't paying too close attention, but the movie extends beyond what a kid will understand, with extended dream sequences and commentary on corruption, the distribution of recourses, the progress of civilization, and what makes us who we are, whether it be our past accomplishments, our future goals, or how we act in the present.The humor is extraordinarily well done, and the action is well designed and very fun. There are some brilliant Chekhov's Guns that fire, the overall plot structure is perfect, and the mystery is executed strongly. The action is surprisingly good, especially the ""Ride of the Valkyries"" bit. The visuals are breathtaking, and the music, when it is not being used for comedic purposes, is equally breathtaking. The scenes with abstract sequences and spiritual undertones are by far what make me feel this movie is better than its given credit for, and its animation style and character designs are unique and detailed.This movie contains the best scene I have ever watched. I re-watch it whenever I can, and I listen to the music from that scene whenever I can. I have never seen a more elegant abyss and rebirth in a classic heroes journey. Rango's crossing to the other side and becoming a true hero is inspiring and spiritual and transcendent. I genuinely don't know why it isn't more praised.This movie is silly for a lot of its runtime, but its emotional beats shine like bright stars. Its humor never fails me. I never grow bored re-watching it.Please, please watch this movie. And if you've already seen it and didn't see what I see, I urge you to watch it again, and this time, see if you can find it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

An animated adventure that challenges conventions,"As the sun scorches the Mojave Desert, a spaghetti-necked chameleon finds itself riding through the dusty streets of Dirt, a desolate town in search of salvation. In this review, we will explore the surreal and extravagant world of ""Rango,"" an animated film that defies genre conventions and stands out for its originality and clever humor. Immersed in the heart of this visual adventure, we meet Rango, a chameleon with a rebellious spirit and a vivid imagination as an aspiring actor. With Johnny Depp's vibrant voice, Rango transforms from a shy pet into an unlikely hero, ready to save the town from its imminent ruin. Gore Verbinski guides us through an animated landscape that evokes the surreal atmospheres of ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,"" with a western touch reminiscent of the epic works of Sergio Leone. The technical mastery is evident in every frame, with attention to detail that transports viewers into a world beyond reality. But don't be fooled by its animated nature: ""Rango"" is a journey aimed at adult audiences, with sharp humor and cinematic references that delight movie enthusiasts. From iconic character cameos to clever jokes, the film offers a treasure trove of surprises for those with keen eyes and acute ears. However, not everything is perfect in this journey into the bizarre West. Excessive indulgence in self-referential humor can sometimes undermine narrative coherence, while some characters may come off as intrusive with their jokes and antics.

Every frame is an artwork, with western giddiness inflicted in every pixel, choreographed and painted with wild vivid imagination! Rango can easily be called a masterpiece in animated movies!

A stranger finds himself crowned their unlikely hero after taking down an imminent danger, with a lot of help from his luck!

Skip This Movie,"I did not enjoy this movie. Maybe I'm used to the wit of Shrek or the pure enjoyment of Cars but Rango was not like either of these (beyond some stunning visuals).First, as others have said, do not bring your kids. Owls hanging from nooses, the same owls continually reassuring you the hero will die, at least one fairly realistic gunning down of a character and quite a bit of death overall. Combine that with the threats of ""I want to watch your eyes as I kill you"" and references to some adult topics (likely over a kids head, but still) and you have a non-kid movie. I would say the big thing is that they really do show death whereas typically it is only alluded to or the characters don't die.Beyond the kid factor, I thought the movie was highly predictable and overall just awkward. At many times it just felt overly drawn out. I think if a person was a huge spaghetti western fan there may be some material here for you, but not for the typical movie goer.In the world of bad westerns and parodies of the genre I feel like this landed more toward the former even if aiming for the latter.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Depp Delivers Once Again,"Rango (2011)*** (out of 4)Johnny Depp voices the title character, a lizard who has the perfect life being taken care of by humans but when he gets thrown out of their car in the desert who soon realizes that he's all alone. He eventually comes to a town where his tall tales capture an audience and they soon make him their Sheriff and now he must try and find out where the water supply has gone because the town in on the verge of having no water. After years of getting no recognition, Depp has finally proved himself to be one of the greatest actors working today so with that being said it might be strange to say that he gives one of the greatest performances of his career here. Yes, this is an animated movie and yes he only does vocal work but it's so perfectly that you can't help but think it's some of the greatest work ever done on an animated movie. Just look at how much energy, passion and just outright fire that Depp manages to bring out of Rango and you just sit there amazed at the vocal range and what all he puts into it. Director Gore Verbinski does a very good job at making sure to keep the rest of the energy of the film up to Depp's level and this really makes for a very fun film. I think the best thing is undoubtedly Depp but the visual style of the movie is also very impressive are the supporting characters. The rodents and other creatures are all extremely memorable and even better is that you really do see them as actual characters and not just some sort of animated creatures. The look of the animation is also very impressive and there are also some great jokes and homages to films like CHINATOWN and The Man with No Name trilogy. RANGO is certainly a very memorable movie but at 107-minutes it does go on a tad bit too long. With that said, Depp's work here is so terrific that you can't help but love what you're watching and he's reason enough alone to make it worth seeing.",,Anonymous,Animation
Skin I live in,"I only watched the version that ran in the cinemas, so I can't comment on the extended Edition that is available on Disc.

I also liked the fact that the movie is goofy but also deep when it comes to its main character (spoken by none other then Johnny Depp).A great main character is always helping, but you also need good supporting characters. And you got them here too. While the story may unfold pretty much as you would expect it to, what will stay with you are the characters. And hopefully some of the jokes too.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

A solid animated film,"From the back of three Pirates of the Caribbean films, Gore Verbinski and Johnny Depp reunited to work together, working on Verbinski's first animated film, a film which won an Academy Award for Best Animated Film.An unnamed and lonely pet chameleon with a lot of acting (Depp) ends up strained in the middle of the desert after a car accident. Desperate for water the chameleon ends up in a western town called Dirt which in the middle of a water crisis and in the local saloon comes up with a new identity as the gunslinger Rango. After Rango accidentally kills a hawk he is celebrated as a hero and becomes the main of the town and is quickly put on the case to find out what is happening to the town's water.Rango is a wonderfully animated film, with a great amount of detail and was able to get a balance between realism and cartoonary, Rango being the most cartoonary looking creature. Because of the animation Verbinski is able to give the film an move the camera to unique places, do incredible shots and make some good action sequences, the scene with the bandits on bats whilst Ride of the Valkryie was an incredible action scene.There is a great voice cast, Depp was unrecognisable as the lead character, someone who suffers an existential crisis, trying to come up with an identity for himself in the world. He was obviously have a lot of fun in the role and Verbinski inhabits the cast with a lot of people Depp could work. Isla Fisher is a strong as the love interest and strong western world woman, who has a fun running gag that she freezes up as defence mechanism, but she does turn into a dismal in distress. Abigail Breslin too has good comic timing as a child character with a dark scene of humour. There are great supporting acting like Ned Beatty, Alfred Molina, Bill Nighy, Ray Winstone and Timothy Olyphant, who are solid through and provide some more serious characters in the film.But is most weird about the film is humour which is dark and morbid. There are some moments that are just out of place, like in the beginning with Road Kill (Molina) who is pretty much sliced in half, a bit dark for a family film and most of the jokes have a dark/adult tone. They are jokes geared to adults like Thespian one but then there are some toilet and fart jokes which felt out of place. There is a chorus of owl who did provide a lot of humour, but there was one fourth wall joke I did like when Rango gets them play for a montage, with one of them even playing an electric guitar: its hardly a deal breaker but it annoyed me. There were moments I laughed heavily like when Rango gave his gun to a child and when Rango punches a woman, and other moments I did smile at.Rango is entertaining and enjoying with some great animation and action. But I personally thought Kung Fu Panda 2 was a better animated 2011 film for the whole family.3.5/5.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Ain't no one, gonna tango, with the Rango","Rango is an oddball idiosyncratic acid-western masterpiece. Simple as that. Imagine Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, but animated and 10x better, and you have Rango. Now, I may be a little biased here, Rango being my all time favorite movie, but anyone who has seen it has to admit that it's awesome. Rango keeps you engaged from the very first weird looking shot to the absolutely epic end credits. If nothing else, Rango's animation is otherworldly. It creates a strange semi-surrealist vivid environment that grabs hold of you and doesn't let you go until the very last shot. It somehow manages to have the uncanny valley effect in all of the best ways, painting a classic western environment then twisting it to fit it's own odd and creative weirdness. Now, it's basic western narrative may not be the most original story ever, but it manages to tell it in such a fun and unconventional way that you don't really notice it's narrative issues until about the 20th rewatch. The first and second acts are both fun and inventive, having some truly awesome moments, but they do at times drag. However, the third act blows past the first two in so many ways, perfectly mixing great narrative moments, epic breathtaking awe-inspiring visuals, and just the perfect amount of surrealist weirdness to create one of the most engaging and enjoyable conclusions to a film ever. Also, Rattlesnake Jake is without a doubt one of the most badass villains of all time. Whoever created that design deserves every good thing that comes to them. Overall, Rango is an incredibly fun, crazy, weird, beautiful film that ranks up there with Spider-verse as one of the best animated films ever. The 7.2 imdb score is disgraceful. 9.5/10. Peak fiction.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one","I grew up watching rango and I never fully appreciated it. Rango is a funny, well acted, western parody. Rango is one of the most overlooked parodies ever, this film parodies the western genre as well as Shaun of the dead parodies zombie movies or Hot fuzz parodies action films, it hits all the right clichés and makes fun of them in a somewhat subtle way. My favourite thing about Rango is the unique character design that makes you feel as if every single character has had a life just the same as our hero's, the animation is a bit dated in 2020 but it's not distracting. Music is important to me and Rango uses it very well, the score is never overbearing and is used only when it fits, and the licensed songs are also used very well and are very fitting. There are a lot of times where the visual comedy does not work which is a shame as the rest of the film is genuinely funny.I think Rango is a underrated film that I would recommend to everybody.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Best Johnny Depp Voice acted film, and animated film in decades!!!!!!","""Rango"" is some kind of a miracle: An animated comedy for smart moviegoers, wonderfully made, great to look at, wickedly satirical, and (gasp!) filmed in glorious 2-D. Its brilliant colors and startling characters spring from the screen and remind us how very, very tired we are of simpleminded little characters bouncing around dimly in 3-D. The title character is a lizard, voiced by Johnny Depp. Just an ordinary lizard. You know, green and with scales and popeyes. But to this humble reptile comes the responsibility to bring civilization to Dirt, an untamed Western town tormented by villains and running desperately short on water. The other characters are outsize versions of basic Western types. There is, for example, Rattlesnake Jake (Bill Nighy), the bad man whose gang holds the town in a grip of terror. After Rango accidentally kills the eagle that has been dining on Dirt's citizens, he is persuaded by the mayor (Ned Beatty) to wear the sheriff's badge and bring law to Dirt. This involves tough talk in saloons, face-downs on Main Street and a chase sequence between high canyon walls that's a nod in the direction of ""Star Wars."" ""Rango"" loves Westerns. Beneath its comic level is a sound foundation based on innumerable classic Westerns, in which (a) the new man arrives in town, (2) he confronts the local villain, and (3) he faces a test of his heroism. Dirt has not only snakes but vultures to contend with, so Rango's hands are full. And then there's the matter of the water crisis. For some reason, reaching back to the ancient tradition of cartoons about people crawling through the desert, thirst is always a successful subject for animation. The movie is rated PG. I hope it will be huge at the box office. Godard said that the way to criticize a movie is to make another movie. ""Rango"" is a splendid and great-looking entertainment with a strong story, limitless energy and a first-rate voice cast, also including Abigail Breslin, Ned Beatty as the disabled mayor, Alfred Molina, Bill Nighy, Stephen Root, Timothy Olyphant, Ray Winstone, and, yes, Harry Dean Stanton. No, Sam Elliott, but you can't have everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Among the best animated features,"First, Rango is not for a child who's not in school yet, or for that matter a child who's under about 8, with some variation based on the intelligence level of the child. I personally don't feel there's anything that is just WRONG for a child to watch, and the PG rating is appropriate, vs. PG-13. Most of the humor though won't be understood by a child not exposed to various humor, and a bit of the humor requires an adult mind. Consequently it makes great viewing for adults or a family, or kids near or in their teens.The imagery of Rango is OUTSTANDING, and I feel the CGI is better than other animated movies, with maybe one or two exceptions where they may be on the same level, and IMO the CGI rivals that of the best blockbuster movies, of any genre.The storyline isn't complicated, and it doesn't need to be; the journey along the storyline is everything.If you allow yourself the pleasure, you will laugh or at least smile most your way through the movie, but if you start the movie with an overly critical mind, you'll find your reasons to criticize. I recommend easing up a bit of that critical part of you, and enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good fun,"Rango is a chameleon. Literally. He is wandering through the desert, having escaped the clutches of a hawk, when he stumbles into the town of Dirt. After massively exaggerating his skills as a gunfighter, challenging the town hoodlum to a duel and (accidentally) killing the town's greatest menace, a large hawk, he is made Sheriff of the town. It is then that he discovers that the town has a massive water shortage. After chasing down some outsiders who robbed the bank, it appears the reason for the shortage may be due to intentional interference, and may be close to home.Good fun. Started pretty badly - plot was over the place and it appeared you needed to be high to enjoy it. However, from a point, around about the saloon scene, the movie finds focus and kicks up several notches. Ends having a decent plot (though a tad derivative of Chinatown), some good humour, great CGI and good action sequences.Vocal casting is spot-on, with Johnny Depp to the fore as Rango. All-star supporting cast delivers in spades.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Skip The Rango,"I wanted to like this movie. I really really did! But I just couldn't. I was sick that day but my son wanted to see it anyway so we went. We even went to a theater where you sat and ate your dinner and watched, and the chairs were very comfy computer chairs. So it wasn't like I was uncomfortable! I was just was so disappointed. I'm being generous here. I did NOT enjoy this movie much. There were a few laughs here and there but it is not for kids. The language, the humor, sexual references! It just didn't need it. And it was S L O W. I took out some paper and started making a grocery list! Even my 5 year old started to fidget! I have to agree with a lot of the posters here. This just was not what I expected at all.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Overlong but mostly works despite awkwardly jumping between audiences all the time,"This is such a strange film to watch because you never really get a feel for who it is actually made for. The easiest answer is that it is for all ages and this would perhaps explain why it took up so much time to deliver a rather straightforward plot – because of it trying to do things for so many sections of one audience. The plot sees an aspiring actor lose his way and end up in a smaller western town. Keen not to get killed, he adopts a tough character and plays the role to the hilt. The town embraces him due to his (accidental) disposing of a villain and soon he is charged with returning water to the dying town – a task that sees him come up against much bigger villains and also forced to confront the truth that his whole personae is just an act. Oh, forgot to say – he's a chameleon.On the face of it, this is a cartoon so therefore it is for children. On the other side it starts very early with references that children wouldn't get and never stops them. But then again it is full of very noisy sequences and sight gags, but then on the other side again we have characters from 1970's westerns, from Chinatown and have lots of slightly crude (but funny) humor. This would not be the first film to have material for children and adults but in Rango they never really seemed to gel – so here it wasn't a throwaway line for adults, but whole chunks of the films plot and themes seemed more suited to an older audience, whereas it would snap back into kiddie mode at times. The mix never comes together to produce one film for everyone but this isn't to say it doesn't work.Personally I think the children get the rough end of the deal because I found Rango really funny at times and also really enjoyed the cinematic references and the endless knowing gaps which would go over younger heads. For them they are left with the lesser part of the film – the empty noise, the fast moving sequences which seem to only exist for the sake of having them – maybe they work, but they are thinly spread over 2 hours, most of which children I guess will be more bored and perhaps annoyed at their parents enjoying it more than they. The voice work is part of this. I really enjoyed Depp here; his character is funny and his delivery is just right for the material. He is supported by probably more famous faces than the film needs (Fisher, Beatty, Molina, Nighy, Stanton, Olyphant, Winstone etc) but they all add a sense of class. The animation is top-notch and I liked that it was inventive within the visual themes of the western – it never felt like a copy or ripoff so much as a starting point to then do more.Rango doesn't totally work as a whole film. It has much to recommend about it but it is overlong and it does seem fragmented between audiences. The older viewer gets the better part of the film and if you go with it there is a solid plot supported at every turn by references, jokes and solid playing from all involved. Not perfect but I enjoyed it.",,Anonymous,Animation
A fun film.,"A fun film.The film starts with lizard having fun in water and then the Intro of RANGO happens in a bar. Watch it to see how the transformation happens from a lizard to a hero. This brings back the same fun ride that we had in childhood in a much better choreographed way with brilliant animation, sound and video quality but yet it's the same fun. This film reminisces of the West Classics like The Good The Bad and The Ugly and the music for sure will make us recede to those times of Ennio Morricone classic pieces of music.Now the technical part, dialogue is sharp witted and lines of Rango voiced by Johnny Depp are the best ones and the voice is done so well by Johnny who comes out yet again with a performance that is awestruck. The animation of rodents, reptiles and is done well and the textures can be appreciated and the differences too can be figured out there is a lot of detailing that has to be seen and it's a rarity actually for the Non Pixar Animated movies.. Directed by Gore Verbinski who directed the Pirates movies has done this one too with heart and an uncomplicated mind. The screenplay is lethargic at most time echoing most of themes the western classics like brawls between the gun holders, bank robbery etc...This for sure is a movie that is enjoyable if we have time to give for it, but I doubt really how many can invest their time for this tiny Rango It's 3/5.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hats off to Depp,"I never wanted to watch this movie. The characters seemed disgusting and the start seemed boring and so I watched it just coz I dint have any other. But now I feel so bad for my decision of not watching such a wonderful flick. First of all its not a movie for kids but it doesn't mean it fails for us as well. The script is not new and basically styled in western form. The most appealing thing is the visuals and animation which are just flawless with extreme quality. Secondly the characterization which is not found too strong in much of the animated flicks. Johny Depp has given life to the character of Rango seriously. He's terrific and it feels as if the character was made for the voice of Depp only. All the other characters are greatly characterized as well esp Rattlesnake and Mayor. The elements of humor are placed perfectly. The movie is a little dark and contains some violent scenes not meant for kids but hell I enjoyed them. Very good direction plus excellent cinematography. Obviously it's not perfect as I feel the script could have been better but visually 10 on 10 except the ugly looking characters. I loved it pretty much and would definitely recommend to all and ones again, hats off to Johny Depp for making Rango alive.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Rango,"We all face an existential crisis at some time or another, just usually not when we're seven, which will likely be the mean age of children watching this newest non-Pixar non- DreamWorks animated feature. No, ""Rango"" won't challenge kids to contemplate their role in the cosmos, but that's precisely the predicament of its main character, a theatrical lizard who finds himself - as many animals in animated films do these days - thrust out of domestic bliss and forced to reckon with the untamed and unforgiving nature of the wild natural world. But in addition to all its verboseness and abstract homage to classic Westerns, ""Rango"" equally dishes out top-notch physical humor and creative characters for the young ones to lap up, even if they're not exactly of age to, as the film puts at least once, ""ruminate.""",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
no one expects a western (or an animated feature) to mention Kim Novak,"Having directed Johnny Depp in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, Gore Verbinski had him voice the lead role in the Academy Award-winning ""Rango"".

We get references to the spaghetti westerns, natch, but also to ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"", ""Chinatown"", ""Apocalypse Now"", and others.

"Quite chaotic and rather delirious, but still fun","When we hear about a Gore Verbinski/Johnny Depp tandem, we all know what movie franchise comes to mind first. Pirates of the Caribbean is a huge defining point for both the director and the actor, since the former will hardly ever beat the overall success of it with any other movie, and for the latter his character of Captain Jack Sparrow was, is and probably will stay the most recognizable image he ever brought to life. It's hard to get away from your fame, and it's probably the case when it becomes your curse - just like the Black Pearl's crew was cursed for being too successful at plundering.At first glance, it's hard to imagine anything more opposite to Pirates of the Caribbean than Rango. And not only because it's an animation. Rango is a story of a pet chameleon who's deeply in the hell of a self-identification crisis, and Captain Jack Sparrow would be the last person in the world to question himself who he is. Yet there's a strong vibe of the whole PotC trilogy (to me it IS a trilogy) coming from Rango. The Curse of the Black Pearl was all adventures, Dead Man's Chest was all goofy and slapstick, and At World's End was a rather surreal journey to the other side. And Rango has it all.But in this attempt to transmit the already well-mastered recipe for success from one franchise to another Gore Verbinski chose the second installment of PotC as the base tone. Which is weird, because, apart from being a huge commercial hit, Dead Man's Chest was a rather flat and over-the-top action adventure which, as most second episodes of trilogies do, simply served as a link towards the climactic third act. And while Rango was showing some promise to become a parable of the social inequality, a satire about brainwashing, vice and exploitation, and finally a story of a person on his self-exploring journey, it's still mostly a situation comedy where a striving for local punchlines outweighs a global dramatic effect. Jump funny, say fancy words very fast and make weird noises - and you're good to go. Yee-haw!I guess it's actually enough for the audience that simply wants to be entertained. After all, Rango is beautifully animated, and it definitely delivers a feast for your senses. But for those who prefer to go deeper, Rango could be a much more fulfilling, albeit not so happy, tribute to Johnny Depp's own thespian journey. Rango is a chameleon, an ever-mimicking creature, who has to play a character he invented himself - because he has no idea who he actually is as a person. Just like Johnny Depp himself, who had enacted so many personas during his actor's career that to most people he's just Jack Sparrow or even ""that guy from that movie"". It may be a hymn to the whole tribe of actors, but Johnny Depp is probably the most prominent example of a person who's been in so many pairs of shoes throughout his whole life that it's getting difficult to remember which one is actually yours.The ending, when our hero rides into sunset to solidify himself as an icon to be remembered, is a sort of a silent resignation to this fate. After all, what's the point in trying to define and defend your personal individuality if everyone else will still have his own image of you that's only vaguely related to the reality. Apparently, this choice goes beyond a single film, because in the next work of the aforementioned tandem, The Lone Ranger, Johnny Depp's character is all but a legend alive, with hardly anything truly human in it. Depp may be a most perfect hanger for film personas, but they do start to feel somewhat empty inside. Just like this film itself. But if you're not looking for more than what meets the eye, you'll be thoroughly entertained, because, even though the make-up may be flaking, the smile still stays on. Show must go on, and it will go on. Amen.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Warm, mature, fun... esp. if you like old wild west movies","Saw 'Rango' (2011)As a rule, I hate lizards... and even more so, I hate snakes. I hate snakes more than Indiana Jones. I mean - I hate them more than Indy hates them; not I hate them more than I hate Indy. I love Indiana Jones.OK... So to recap - Lizards, snakes... hate. But I still enjoyed Rango. It's a quaint animated tale of an ordinary chameleon who gets lost on the desert highway, on a search for his own identity. He wanders into the desert town of 'Dirt', a town that is drying up fast and whose people are loosing hope. Here, he adopts the persona of Rango, a dangerous wild west style outlaw. Through a series of quirky coincidences and sheer luck, he manages to become the town's sheriff, and becomes the beacon of hope for the people of Dirt.If you've been a fan of the old wild west movies, I'm sure you will enjoy Rango.

Why is this movie doing so well?,"Because there is literally nothing playing right now. After checking all theaters, even second run theaters, it was either this movie or Harry potter which was at a second run theater and we just missed the 5 O'clock showing. I really don't like harry potter but I love the characters and production value, dialog is just really weird. But then, having no alternative, and determine to see ""SOMETHING"" we saw this one, well the first 40 minutes of it before getting our money back.Keep in mind even rich people get bored in Oregon as there isn't too much to do on a Friday night but eat, drink, and see a movie.....that's it.Now don't get me wrong, even ""I am Bruce"" which is a corniest B movie ever was still a lot of fun to watch but the first thought that came to mind about this movie was, ""HUH?"" My girlfriend and I looked around and the rest of the audience were shifting in there seat and not a single laugh at any of the ""funny parts"". Which 40 minutes into you'd think there would be at least one but nothing really good about it. Now granted maybe it would pick up in another hour or two but lets admit it, compare this to Pixar's ""Up"" Which had you Crying and Laughing, then crying, then laughing again all with in a 10 minute span. These guys are no Pixar, and this movie isn't even rentable. I'm not even sure why it is going for an academy award except for its special effects which is a lame way of putting it. Cause it makes it seem like its going there for best picture, best performance, best script or something which they were all bad. The effects were great, but who cares? South park is just a step above as bad as ANIME but its funny, sick and demented but funny anyway. Once again people are not focusing on what really counts in entertainment, ""Is it entertaining?""And like the others it was gross, slightly on the racist side I mean why did everything in the desert have to have a Hispanic accent? Yeah sure its a western but in some of the best westerns you don't have everyone speaking with that accent. I wouldn't be too surprised if the Hispanic community would have had a problem with every grungy nasty animal had to be of Hispanic origin.So we went home and watched a Pixar movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
How the West was fun,"Over the years, Pixar has pretty much dominated the field of CG animated films. Sure, there have been plenty of competitors, such as Dreamworks ('Shrek') and Blue Sky ('Ice Age') but nobody has really been able to knock Pixar off its pixelated throne. Enter ILM, a company known primarily for its strength in special effects. If 'Rango' is anything to go by, Pixar may finally have a serious adversary.'Rango' is an adventure-comedy about a lonely pet chameleon (Johnny Depp) with aspirations of adventure and heroism. Rango gets his chance when he is left in the Mojave desert and accidentally becomes the sheriff of Dirt, and Old West town inhabited by desert animals.The single most remarkable thing about this film is how great it looks. From the texture of the characters' skin to the cracks in the run-down buildings that make up Dirt, the level of detail that ILM have created is breathtaking. The colours are so clear and the animations so sharp that the film is sure to become a TV-showroom favourite when it is eventually released in high-definition.Gore Verbinski's previous experience directing live action certainly helps, as does consultation from 'True Grit' director of photography Roger Deakins. Everything is expertly framed, and would not look out of place in a ""proper"" Western. Despite being an animated film, 'Rango' has beautiful cinematography.It's not all about the looks though. 'Rango' is very well written, especially when it comes to its humour, which flows seamlessly from deliciously witty dialogue to Buster Keaton style physical gags. The humour is at its best when the film goes into parody mode, making fun of the seriousness in the Western genre with a plethora of references that is part homage, part pisstake.Surprisingly, 'Rango' is a Western first, and a kid's film second. The story is a tried and tested Western trope, and works well in the film despite the fact that everybody is an animal. It is the classic ""stranger comes to town"" formula, where the stranger must prove himself to people and eventually become their hero. Sure, it is a comedy, but Rango's story is told with such earnestness that one can't help but take him seriously.The best animated films are the ones that cater to the adults as as well as a younger audience, and this is very much the case with 'Rango'. Beneath the surface of primary colours and animated animals lies a surprising amount of maturity. Themes of heroism and bravery are old news, but existentialism and surrealism in an animation has to be pretty rare. Rango spends the entire film struggling with his lack of identity and his search for meaning in life may bore younger viewers, or go over their heads entirely.With 'Rango', ILM have created one of the most grown-up animated films to date. Its interesting blend of seriousness and humour also makes it one of the most unique. 'Rango' is a great family film, just don't expect it to be quite like 'Finding Nemo'.",,Anonymous,Animation
Rango,I wasn't sure about this film when I first heard of it but I gave it a chance any way. I'm glad I did. The animation itself is pretty good but not as good as the likes of Pixar and the film in my opinion runs a bit too long but they are the only flaws. The characters in the film are fantastic ranging from the strange side characters to the main they provide plenty of laughs through out and also they provide a level of charm which has you feeling for them. Its too early to tell how this film will stack up against the other animated films which are on the way but I personally think its one you shouldn't miss out on it will keep you entertained throughout what ever age you are!,6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""I WILL BLOW THAT UGLY RIGHT OFF YOUR FACE!""","Rango (2011) -My Nephews recommendation to watch this was a beautiful and wonderful thing. Instead of suggesting I watch 'The Meg' (2018) just to see how bad it was, he actually got me to watch something fantastic.I couldn't believe that I had gone so long without seeing this. It was truly genius, with something for absolutely everybody, even Granny could enjoy it and if nothing else the nippers would appreciate the funny characters and the colours, although I did love the realistic tones that they used throughout. In fact a lot of it was very realistic, except perhaps for the various animal characters, but that was to be expected, not many lizards walk on their hind legs, wear clothes or talk, that I know of.As the film started I had no idea what I had let myself in for, not knowing whether it I'd been set up by the youngest of my sisters kids, if it was a Western, a comedy, something serious or a story about one city Lizard lost in the desert.I couldn't possibly fathom the way that things would go for Johnny Depp's character Rango (Lars) and I loved that unknown, because even the first five minutes made me feel like it was one to watch.There was great characterisation from the artists and the actors vocal performances were spot on casting. I could actually see Johnny Depp when Rango was impersonating the townsfolk of Dirt. It was as if the cartoonists had studied his mannerisms very clearly, with touches of Jack Sparrow (Pirates Of The Caribbean - 2003) thrown in for fun.Some people might consider the choices of the actors a bit strange, because some of the biggest names/main characters were not even American, but British and Australian and actually they somehow worked better.In general the whole thing was really quite clever, the writing, the production and the way the characters were so human, almost as if they had recorded the actors live and painted over them afterwards.The background art was superbly lifelike too and I loved the cross between a 'Borrowers' styled world with the more traditional western town.Unlike a lot of the films that I've seen lately, and made for a younger generation, there was some great adult humour dotted throughout and yet it was still colourful and fun for the kiddies too. Nothing was compromised.In fact there were some very adult jokes, that made me properly laugh, but fortunately they were things that could and probably would easily be missed by the child folk. I appreciated the effort to include those of us who might have been dragged to the cinema to see it, or may have been subjected to watching the DVD/Streaming on repeat, by the various ankle biters in our lives.Okay, so there were a lot of film cliches, but they were done in such funny ways, that it was easily forgiven. I suppose that it could be said that this was Paramount's answer to Aardman's 'Flushed Away' (2006), as it covers similar ideas.The serenading owls were a lovely touch and there were many other things like that all the way through. Things that I will be looking out for when I definitely watch it again, maybe tomorrow even, it was that enjoyable. A fun way to bring the Western genre to a new generation.955.98/1000.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Short note/ Warning,"I would advise reviewing this movie VERY carefully before watching it with a child. Regardless of its looks, is as nasty as any other western, and for a child the animal animations could cause very bad dreams (or other unwanted reactions). Lots of gun fights, chases, and some other scenes i cannot mention without spoiler alert. Also add that most animals are reptiles and amphibians, so they have disturbing looks, especially since they are made to look worse than in real life.Good movie for adult/ teenage crowd though, i think parents would enjoy watching it alone and then decide if they want their children to see it. It is a win/win situation that way. Personally i feel animation movies should not be that dark in mood.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Sublime,"This film is too good for children and most adults. Next to Jaws, perhaps the greatest movie ever made. No spoilers. No existential critique of plot, format or character development.

Colorful Satire of the Spaghetti Western Sometimes Seems Too Adult,"A perfectly fine little family adventure that won't compete with any Pixar or Dreamworks masterpieces, but doesn't presume to in the first place. Johnny Depp brings what he does to every picture these days - an inimitable lust for life and boatloads of free-wheeling character - but the film doesn't make much effort to move beyond its status as a playground for his zealous voice work. Rango's plot is very by-the-books, and despite several amusing nods and winks to other pictures along the way, is never quite able to shake that burr loose from the heel of its boot. For a PG kids' picture, it also pushes the envelope in several spots with an armful of violence and a dozen jokes that will sail right over a younger audience's head. Didn't really bother me, personally, but it's not something I'll be pulling out for the rugrats until they're a bit older. It's good enough, with a genuinely excellent guest appearance at its climax, but never really approaches greatness.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A high 8, low 9. An animation on par with Frozen","The story has character, the characters are charming, and the visuals (discounting the first 20 minutes) are quite exquisite.On the first count, the story is fairly watertight with only a few scenes that could be trimmed and streamlined, but most impressively, it does a good job of remaining fresh and original while parodying spaghetti westerns. Rango manages to side-step a lot of the western cliches, relegating those strictly to visual and audio motifs. In staying with an original story, Rango should also be commended for their refreshing tale without the need for plot twists, a crutch that storytelling giant Disney has fallen on so frequently in recent years. Despite their narrative handholding and generous foreshadowing, we're still rewarded with an exhilarating climax with a strong albeit brief standoff between the main forces of the story.Also, the owl band is super charming. Best part of the movie hands down.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Printing the Legend of Rango,"In the film, we are first introduced to a lone gecko creating a movie scene with the inanimate objects in his cage. He is creating a storyline where after being faced with exciting events, he is the hero. As the props give out, Rango is crestfallen as he realizes the mundane and anticlimactic world in which he lives. Then, all of a sudden, the car has to swerve, and Rango's tank flies from the car. Miraculously, Rango finds himself alive on the side of the highway in the desert looking at his shattered home and watching his owner drive away. Alone and faced with the threat of dehydration, starvation, and other dangers, Rango befriends an armadillo. Eventually, Rango finds a town that is faced with a diminishing water supply, a terrorizing hawk, a corrupt mayor, and other unsavory characters. After being appointed sheriff, Rango is given the opportunity to live out the exciting life he had always dreamed for himself. Or so it appears While Rango may appear to just be another children's film about an eccentric pet who has lost his way, it really does encompass all of the themes found in a typical western film. Most notably, Rango (voiced by Johnny Depp)depicts the concept of ""printing the legend."" As in the classic ""TheMan Who Shot Liberty Valance,"" sometimes the story that transpires is actually much different from the reality of the events. For instance,in one scene of the film, it appears that Rango kills a hawk who was bullying and terrorizing the town. Much like with Ranse Stoddard in""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,"" Rango was credited with taking care of the town's enemy. Throughout the remainder of Rango's time as sheriff , there are other achievements that he is credited for. Despite the actual circumstances surround the events, the legend was printed. One of the many reasons printing the legend has become a prevalent and well accepted practice in our society is because it gives hope to the society at large that they too can become a hero, just like Rango.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good Not Great,"Rango is one of those movies where I did not have any idea what to expect when I took my seat in the theater to watch it. I have always been a big big fan of Johnny Depp and all the movie choices he has made over the years so I had an open mind but thought this movie looked like it was maybe a big mistake based on the commercials and trailers I had seen for it. Over all I was not disappointed, it was a decent animated movie. Not like other things I've seen from Johnny Depp that's for certain. It's funny in places and definitely is the kind of movie you would want to take your kids to see, it's safe for kids just a couple of ""rude parts"" as the ratings warning says. That is about it, the voices are great including Ned Beatty, I would recommend it but not a big deal if you wait to see it on TV or DVD.",,Anonymous,Animation

"An enjoyable film that gives us, perhaps, more than we could have hoped for.","This film surprised by not coming from any of the major animation studios and, even so, having a lot of quality and winning the Oscar for Best Animated Film. I didn't see it at the time, I just saw it now, but I can say that I was reasonably pleased. The film pays an honorable tribute to the old western movies with a narrative set in the present day, but in a small village in the Nevada desert, where the water has disappeared, causing fear to all the residents, who still live and behave as they did in the old days.Of course, the characters are anthropomorphic animals, and the protagonist is an unnamed chameleon (mistakenly called lizard by everyone) who, already in the city, adopts the name of Rango, eventually being promoted sheriff. As such, he will have to deal with bandits, protect the already scarce water supplies and find out what happened to these supply. Overall, the story is quite satisfying and has its merits. The film is neither too childish nor overly tiring for adults, I felt there was enough material to appeal to a wide range of age groups.Directed by Gore Verbinsky, the film has a very pleasant pace, despite being a little longer than most animated films, which almost never exceed 90 minutes. In addition to really beautiful and well-executed cinematography, with good lighting and good use of color, the film has the best digital animation, clearly evident in the details of the buildings, the characters and the environment in which they move. The issue of water, and its importance, was not wrongly thought either, and it seems increasingly relevant in the times we live in... you don't have to live in the desert to feel the lack of drinking water. The soundtrack also deserves a special mention for its relevance and quality, with melodies that alternate between epic, western and Latin-Mexican.Finally, a note of appreciation for the quality of the voice actors and the work they did together: Johnny Depp works very well with his voice in the main character, and he still plays another character, in another vocal timbre. Isla Fisher, Abigail Breslin, Bill Nighy, Ned Beatty and Alfred Molina are all in great shape here.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Flawed but forgivable,"Rango is literate, but plagued by ridiculous plot devices and implausible mythology IE; Anthropomorphic animals capable of industrialized culture coexisting in a universe with modern humans.Animals can be flattened by trucks and survive, but also shot and killed. There are no consistent physical laws or rules in this universe. It exists solely as a vehicle for it's loquacious script, good humor, and strange social and political commentary.With religious themes, dark gross out humor and some over the top adult dialog, this may not be the best choice for younger viewers.

Go Rango!!!!,"I have nothing but praise for Rango. It was one of the best movies I have seen all year. Definitely on my personal list of top 50 movies. A great movie to see with friends and a great family movie. Both of the friends I went to see it with didn't like it for some dumb reason or another, but I absolutely loved it. I was laughing for weeks after, more than worth the $12 I spent to see it in theaters. I was crying because I was laughing so much.I really enjoyed it, all 107 minutes of it. Rango is such a great character, so dramatic and triumphant. The only thing was that I didn't see much character development on his part. These days it's hard to come across good original comedy, but Rango was original and silly. In the trailer they show the actors acting out the movie, and throughout the movie I pictured the actors as the characters and let me tell you it was hysterically funny and it added to my experience. I also felt that it helped the actors get into character more.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
a movie which is a complete act,"Rango comes as a complete package. While the movie is animation, the characters touch the mature audience with as much ease as a kid's imagination. The protagonist and his quest to realize who he is takes everyone on a riveting journey. Though, the question seems old, the treatment by Gore Verbinski ensures that there isn't a dull moment. The backdrop of the Wild West makes you almost nostalgic of the classic action movies. Rango mixes the character with shades of humor, wit and effortless storytelling. The animation is good but it has yet to come at par with the expressions and finesse of the already established studios. The supporting characters were not that clearly defined but created an interesting ensemble anyway. The background score of the movie, mostly a compilation of Wild West themes, is simply perfect. Many-a-time you'd find yourself anticipating the exact music sequence, if you're a fan of course. The sequences are action packed and entwined with main plot are many secondary layers of a more philosophical and deep sense of understanding. It's the kind of movie that can be watched over and again. A must watch movie for 2011.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disappointing,"I was very disappointed in this movie, I was excited about seeing this cartoon from seeing the previews.

I was there with 3 teenage girls and they also stopped in the middle of the cartoon and complained about the language. They need to rethink the guidelines on rating movies. I would have been upset had I taken a small child to see this movie. Not what I expected and wouldn't recommend seeing.

Like a Cadillac with no fuel,"Just got back from seeing Rango with my wife. They couldn't seem to make up their mind who they were making a movie for.I expected it was primarily geared toward children, but there was a fair amount of profanity and innuendo. I felt uncomfortable for a lot of the people there with their young children. Really not a movie for young kids.Rango's character experienced some personal development, but overall, I just didn't think the characters or the plot had enough depth to keep an adult interested.Without giving too much away, it is basically a spaghetti western type story. I think the intent is for it to be about Rango developing as an individual, but it mostly feels like it's about everyone being thirsty. (With the price of concessions these days, it presented me withquite a dilemma...if you see it, be sure to bring a giant drink with you.)I will say, the visuals are absolutely incredible. Some of the action scenes are really well done. All the close-ups of the characters are impressive. The voicing is well done, and there are several humorous moments that were enjoyable.Overall, it's beautiful, but it moves along too slow. I didn't feel like it had enough substance to keep me interested. It's kind of like having a shiny new Cadillac, but no fuel. Beautiful to look at, and an terrific cast, but in the end, I was just couldn't find enough to care about to stay interested.I love most of the actors involved, and really wanted to like it, but just didn't.

Amazing Animated western movie!,Rango was a Good looking Animated movie that came out in 2011. But yes it was made by Nickelodeon which they went kinda too far with the dark moments and deaths and language. Johnny Depp is such an amazing actor and He did great voicing act for the character. Isla Fisher voiced Beans too. The Mayor was voiced by Ned Beatty. And other great voices for the other characters.Also i liked the parts when Rango killed that vicious hawk from kept trying to attack and eat him. And the Owl Mariachi band guys keeping saying when was he gonna die?! Soon.. Lol! Rattlesnake Jake was the bad villain too.Still I Remember all the good times i had with this movie.

Marvelous tongue-in-cheek parody of the classic western,"A thespian wannabe lizard (voiced by Johnny Depp) ends up in a western town (""Dirt"") and by accident (and chutzpah) becomes its sheriff -- and through a series of further accidents saves the town and ultimately gets the girl.""Rango"" seems specifically designed for and is far more fun for adults than kids. While the story can stand alone, the more movies and cowboy westerns you've seen, the more fun you'll have watching this because it uses bits and pieces from so many of them to spin a classic story in a tongue-in-cheek way. It's kind of a ""Blazing Saddles"" parody but done with animals in all the roles of a classic western.Well, almost all.A CGI animated version of Clint Eastwood makes a brief appearance driving a golf cart loaded with 4? Oscar statues.The characters the various animals play are all marvelous and distinctive. The computer graphics by Industrial Light & Magic are incredible--the textures of everything (lizards' and snakes' skin, birds' feathers, animals' fur and hair, weathered wood, rusted iron) are extremely realistic. The director is the same as for the ""Pirates of the Caribbean."" Very funny, very enjoyable--both cerebral and slapstick.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Ballad of Rango,"Rango, director Gore Verbinski's (Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, The Weather Man) first foray into animation, is a mesmerizing display of both animation and storytelling. We follow a chameleon, voiced wonderfully by the talented Johnny Depp, whose life is turned upside down when he finds himself stranded in the desert. After an encounter with a hawk, our chameleon friend runs into another critter of the desert, a lizard named named Beans (Isla Fisher), who brings the chameleon into town.In the town of Dirt we meet an array of strange looking characters, all of which seem to be confused and curious about this newcomer the chameleon. Now, our friend who remains nameless up until this point, is an actor by trade, though I guess you could call it desire, who is in search of finding his own identity. When approached with the question of who he really is, he quickly comes up with the back story for...Rango.Rango quickly becomes the town's new hero/sheriff. His first task is to settle the unpleasantness surrounding the towns water supply, which dwindles day by day. With the help of Beans and some of the other locals, Rango gets a posse together to find the missing water. Should he fail, the future of Dirt looks mighty grim.This movie had the potential to be a cheesy, kid-joke infused, chaotic romp and a poor excuse of a western. Yet just the opposite happened. The jokes are witty, it is very controlled, and it is an excellent western, certainly one of the best since the millennium. The very opening scene with the soon to be named Rango is so clever and unexpected that I thought Nickelodeon had never even screened the movie before being released. There are so many one liners and visuals that go completely, and I mean completely over the younger audience's still developing head. There are some laugh out loud moments for them, but I don't think they will really understand what is going on for most of the movie.There are guns, explosions, and chases to keep them busy, not to mention a fair dose of falls, whacks, and kerplunks. The kids will be fine. It's the adults that really get to enjoy this movie. I would go so far as to say that adults should call a babysitter to forgo any questions their children might have like, ""Why are you laughing?""Depp's performance, and I do mean performance, is remarkable. My brother said that he didn't even think it was Johnny Depp. Depp, whose face and on screen persona is so hard to dismiss, is hidden well behind the uneven eyes of his reptilian persona. His talents along with the entire cast, whose voice acting turned into real acting behind the scenes (I strongly encourage you all to watch the featurettes online) turned out stellar performances similar to those from Wes Anderson's 2009 masterpiece Fantastic Mr. Fox.Verbinski's animation team deserves a great deal of praise as well. The textures and attention to detail rivals that of Pixar, who invented the process of CG feature films. The landscapes, dreamscapes, and everything in between is second to none. The most important part of the animation and perhaps the whole movie is the work done on each individual face. Each character pops off the screen. Usually such craftsmanship is reserved for the main character, the villain, and a few secondary characters (i.e. Carl Frederickson, Russell, Dug, and Charles F. Muntz from Pixar's Up), but here each character, regardless how much screen time they are allowed, is given their own unique features. It's some of the best animation I have ever seen, and that is not an exaggeration.This tightly woven animated movie is a sight to be seen. Need I forget to mention, you don't have to break the bank to see it in 3D. Would it have looked nice, maybe, but this is sure proof that 2D is alive and well in the land of animated films. Will it fluff up those box office numbers, no, but will it win over the hearts of millions like me, starving for some real good animation outside of Disney and Pixar, you betcha.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Tribute to Spaghetti Westerns That Would Make John Wayne and Clint Eastwood Proud,"After viewing this movie with my friends, we could not stop talking about how awesome it was. It was a relief to have finally viewed a proper movie this year, especially after having to sit through the travesty that was Sucker Punch. Anyways...This movie does well in its environment in giving both Pixar and DreamWorks a proper run for their money this year in the Oscar contenders for Best Animated Film. It is both beautiful to look at in every aspect and angle. No expense was spared to give the audience a systematic treat of characters, environment, and an overall western feel that younger audiences will enjoy...though not too much younger.Johnny Depp once again reminds us why he is such a great actor, that you don't have to see Depp to feel his brilliance. Verbinski brings another tale that though it resembles elements of his previous films (i.e. Pirates of the Caribbean), it still stands on its own as a fun film worthy of his name.It did drag slightly towards the end, but like all great westerns, they give the audience action, great dialog, heart, and fun characters that look like they've been out in the sun for too long (the point I believe).I will definitely be purchasing this film when it comes out on DVD and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves the classic westerns of Wayne and Eastwood. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Not suitable for kids under 7 in my honest opinion!,"I went to see this movie under extreme protest and it was OK - I didn't like the type of animation used, nor the western theme, but it had an OK story and even though it was pretty formulaic I can certainly see it appealing to a certain type of audience.I have to say a lot of the themes, language and jokes were simply not kid friendly at all - I had little kids with me as it was only PG rated and they were really, really bored by about 45 minutes in. Two of them actually left with their parent and I saw a lot of other parents with small (toddler - Kindergarten age) kids exiting about an hour in.So, this movie won the box office for sure this week, but I think a lot of parents who waited will not want to go next week when they talk to their friends who will say it is definitely an older kids movie - I'd say honestly 8-10 and upwards.I think this was a solid entry into animation for the director who may be carving his niche by the way his movies are animated - it's not pretty animation, it's not at all cutesie - personally I found it very unappealing visually. But, Tim Burton makes movies that are equally unappealing to me that are loved by his solid core of fans - I think this would appeal to Tim Burton fans a lot.All in all, not an enjoyable movie experience for me - I felt like the plot was a little thin and by the end of the 90 or so minutes I was SO glad it was over.I can't wait for Cars 2 to come out in May - now that movie will appeal to me visually - I'm a Pixar groupie, no wonder this one wasn't my style really.Read some of the other reviews on here, but heed my warning - don't take your under 8's - their whining when they are bored gets very tedious!",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

I'm surprised...,"I am surprised that Rango seems to be doing well in the box office, as I did not think it would appeal to the mainstream American audiences... It certainly follows the classical old western plot, nothing new there, as others have noted, but a certain satisfaction of watching something you know you have seen and perhaps like, if done well.But on top of this plot, there are layers of Fear and Loathing and Star Wars and mariachis that are sometimes not even translated from Spanish, and a pinch of Mary Poppins... So really, the psychedelic quirkiness of the execution of plot made me think that it would not appeal to the mainstream. Voices are done very well, and the art is top-notch. The opening scene has to be one of my favorite scenes in the film, as the lonely pet lizard acts himself into the ""cool guy in town"" with a broken doll, a wind-up gold fish, a beach umbrella, and a dead (real) bug in the little puddle of water in his tank... From this scene, you know Depp will shine. The quick-witted improvisational acting reminded me of Robin Williams's stand-ups. The psychedelic desert scenes were masterful, both in terms of animation and in terms of evoking the good, old western film tradition (I almost expected the whistling to start, the 800 bullets/The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly theme.)I still would not recommend this to my friends who have very mainstream taste and expect an animation film to just be cute and happy. I think most scenes are safe for children, except maybe those involving the large snake, who might be scary.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very well made Oscar-winning animation that cleverly converts the Western to an animated family film. But it's too clever for the children to really enjoy. Needs more heart.,"As others have said, the animation is amazing thanks to its huge Hollywood budget. It is very easy and enjoyable to watch. It is kind of like a mature attempt at an animated family film, as it uses a lot of tropes and conventions of the old Hollywood western movies and transplants them to an animated family film. There are explicit references to Clint Eastwood, the good the bad the ugly, and also other classics such as Chinatown etc for the adults to appreciate. I think, however, that it focussed too much on trying to be clever and appreciated by grown up by adult critics. It is no surprise that this won an Oscar. However, its target audience should be children and families and it is a bit flat and clever for the kids to really get into. It doesn't have the heart and the innocence required for children to really love it. So winning an Oscar says nothing about how successful it was to the majority of people that actually watched it.

Recommendations did the trick, but it never made it to my local cinema and so I waited for a TV airing. As you can probably guess, it aired this week and I'm pleased to say the recommendations were correct! Although not quite up there with the best of the Pixar films, it's still very entertaining and beautifully animated. I will give you my thoughts after this brief summary.When a pet chameleon is involved in an accident that leaves him on a desert road, he looks for help. It first comes in the form of an old armadillo called Roadkill; he sets the chameleon off in the direction of the nearest town, Dirt. On the way he is picked up by Beans who is going to town for supplies for her ranch. Once there the chameleon enters the saloon where he makes himself out to be a bit of a hero a hero called Rango! The townsfolk immediately make him the sheriff; but there's a problem. The town is running out of water, there's very little left in the bank and the mayor is behaving strangely. When the remaining water is stolen from the bank it's up to Rango, and a posse, to go and bring it back. Also, can they solve the mystery of the disappearing water supply? Well, I'll leave it there or the Spoiler Police will be confiscating my glass of nice cool refreshing water by my side here (thirsty?).As I've already said, it's beautifully animated and well worth seeing just for that alone! As for performances, well everyone was very good, particularly Johnny Depp as Rango/Lars, he surprised me with this performance; very reminiscent, at times, of his character, Raoul Duke, in 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'. Isla Fisher as Beans and Abigail Breslin as Pricilla both put in great performances, as did Ned Beatty as the Mayor. Honourable mentions must also go to; Alfred Molina as Roadkill, Bill Nighy as Rattlesnake Jake, Stephen Root as Doc/Merrimack/Mr. Snuggles, Harry Dean Stanton as Balthazar, Timothy Olyphant as Spirit of the West and Ray Winstone as Bad Bill.I must say I did like the offbeat style of this film, very reminiscent of an old Western but with a modern twist. Lots of slapstick comedy moments and some great sight gags add to the fun. A nice score by Hans Zimmer is interspersed by a nice collection of songs, principally performed by 'Los Lobos'. Over all, I found this film very entertaining with some great animation; one I will definitely re-watch sometime Recommended.My score: 7.9/10.IMDb Score: 7.4/10 (based on 57,195 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 88/100 (based on 205 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 69/100 (based on 94,672 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Delightfully quirky, bizarre, and surprisingly intelligent Masterpiece","Rango is a true hidden gem, with superb performances, animation, and incredible writing, it manages to subvert and explore almost every western trope and convention, while still setting up its own themes and characters, and it's truly elegant. The humour never feels immature, or childish, and some of the subtext is truly brilliant. I mean, this is supposed to be a kids movie! I would have rated Rango 9/10 but as it's actually an animated ""kids"" movie, I just have to rate it 10/10. Brilliant, elegant fun.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Whoops a daisy.....,"This is a highly anticipated movie to watch for me, and oh boy did it excite me when I got the tickets. There are a couple of parts which really deserve the ratings, but there is also a 'flaw' that made it deserved 9 instead on 10.Firstly, I love the way the directors decided to insert in the 4 birds that sings music everything a significant event has happened to Rango and his friends. The music are Spanish styled, so it kinds of give us a Spanish ambient mixing with action. Although the birds are sadistic in a sense, that is where the majority of laughter comes from.Secondly, I love the 'creepy' part of the movie. Ever watched The International? There is a part at the end where the assassin said thanks to the male character right? If you were a kid, you won't understand a single thing from the ending. However, Rango adapted some inspiration from it, so it kinds of give people a 'professional' scene from a comedy action movie.Thirdly, I love how the director made it seemed that the movie is going to have an unexpected end at the 'professional' parts. There are 2 parts which seemed like it is going to end off abruptly, but it keeps continuing on. Why did I think it's going to end abruptly? The music. Every time a 'professional' scene is going to end, there's this ending music that you will always hear when a hero saved a heroine and they started to kiss and the movie ended with a zoom out and a fade to black screen. Secondly, the tone. Rango seems serious when he looks serious after consulting his 2 friends. Made it look like the director gonna leave you to think of the ending yourself.Finally, this is the part where Rango loses out the 1 point. So close yet so far! The movie ended very abruptly. VERY. The director chose to tell people the story instead of leaving them to think about the ending. If there wasn't this part where the birds tell another lizard joke, I would have given a 8. What is the ending like and what is the joke? Go see the movie yourself.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
This is a masterpiece. Period,"The creation of a lateral Wild West story out of a pure accidental event is just 100% imagination.

Rango,"So a slight blurb about how surprised I was that Nickelodeon was tackling several mature themes: Rango boasted quite a number of darker undertones that you wouldn't normally expect from a PG, animated Nickelodeon movie. Such areas included language (sporting such lines as ""You son of a-""!, ""Go to hell!"", and ""Can I gut-shoot someone?""), violence (an impressive amount of shooting and dying), sexual themes (making references to how ""active"" one's mother was and a joke about a mammogram), and the film's portrayal of death (where characters constantly expect Rango's death and at one point, parody death by hanging). That is, you could arguably find just as much material in other animated films, such as The Incredibles- but it just goes to show that Nickelodeon is ready to experiment with a braver sort of film, much like Disney did with Pirates of the Caribbean. Okay, disclaimer over.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Fabulous western movie,"Rango, who was a domestic lizard and always dreaming to be a hero, one day escaped from the fish tank and settled foot on the adventurous journey. When he arrived at a small frontier town, he killed an eagle by accident, as a result, Rango was honored as the hero and assigned as the sergeant in this town. However, a rattlesnake, who was an evil, challenged Rango. But eventually, Rango beat the rattlesnake with his wisdom and bravery.This is a fabulous cartoon, as well as an awesome western movie, which shows great veneration to American frontier culture. In this movie, Rango once lost in the journey for seeking ""Spirit of West"", however, when he waked up, he found that the ""Spirit of West"" left some words on the glass ""No man can walk out of his own story."" Consequently, what can we do is just chasing for what we want and try our best to do what can we do. This exactly correspond to the ""Can do"" spirit. As a result, it seems to me that this is an inspiring movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A perfect animated western,"I love this movie. I love this movie a lot. There is so much that I love about Rango ranging from the surreal dream sequences to the Chinatown-esque plot at the same time. The plot is about an acting chameleon who becomes the hero of his own story. The animation matches the level beautifully and it still holds up exceptionally well. Not only that. But the voice acting is outstanding and blends into the picture well. Gore Verbinski worked on Mousehunt, The Weather Man, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl and A Cure for Wellness and here is where his talent really fits the plot well.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Chameleon film made by a bunch of grown-ups!,"I started watching this film just to get it off the list of to-do's and it turns out to conquer a space amongst my personal favourite animated films particularly because of few fatal attractions i.e., Direction of Gore Verbinski, screenplay by John Logan, musical score by Hans Zimmer and the voice performance of Johnny Depp.Gore Verbinski stated at the Oscar that the film was created by a bunch of grown-ups(answering to the question, ""is this film for kids?""), as I feel that he's performed an arduous task in directing this film and I loved every moment of it.John Logan, I've been an admirer of every script that he's written (especially Skyfall, Spectre, The Aviator and now this wonderful idea of making an animated western.Johnny Depp is the real-world chameleon and his wonderful performance as the voice actor the voice and the yelling, I'm flattered.Hans Zimmer and his musical score each time, he does it.

It was OK,"Well, we don't have kids, and I think we were the only ones in the audience without any. That said, we typically enjoy animated flicks quite a bit as they always seem to throw in some good adult humor. About half way through, we realized that most of this humor had been shown to us in the preview we had seen of the movie a few weeks prior. This movie was really hyped a lot so maybe we just had higher than normal expectations. It just didn't live up. Although I did like the animation a lot and the characters were pretty great- sometimes it was just so slow! Basically, my husband and I were bored a lot of the time. It seemed to just drag on and on. You know a movie is not so great when you can't wait for it to just end all ready. When we left the theater, every parent had a sleeping child in their arms- so maybe we weren't the only ones that were bored?",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

The Best Western,"Rango is one of, if not the best movies I've ever seen. The story is fun, the character designs are great, and the animation uses the character designs to it's own advantage, such as in one scene where an owl is being punched, and reverses it's head to avoid the punches. The rattlesnake character was terrifying and extremely cool at the same time. The ending is great, the storyline makes sense, the landscape design is masterful, it's all around an amazing movie. Johnny Depp did an amazing job as Rango. If you're new to westerns, I probably wouldn't recommend it, but if you want some funny movie you can sit down with your kids and watch, Rango is the perfect choice.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Rango...,"To be honest, animated movies in 2011 were not very good. We had ""Cars 2"", ""Happy Feet 2"", ""Mars Needs Moms"", etc. But among all those bad films, there was one that stood out for its well-written script, its risky visuals and its tribute to the Westerners. Rango is a film full of action and incredible characters. It was hands down the best animated movie of 2011 and I really recommend watching it as soon as possible.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A mature, beautifully made gem of a film!","RangoGore Verbinski's Rango is a wonder amongst animated films. Naturally, the colourful, larger than life medium lends itself to the eyes, ears and hearts of children, which is the direction most of the, take. But Rango presents a mature, raunchy, surreal, absurd spectacle rife with a mischievous buzz, and peppered with laughs just bordering on the inappropriate for children, even though they'd go right over their heads anyway.this movie broke the record for how many times my jaw hit the floor seeing what they could do with the visuals. It's detailed, meticulous, gorgeously rendered and beautifully crafted. Johnny Depp gives wit, endearing naivety, and a sense of childlike wonder to his creation Rango, a little lizard in the big desert, violently thrown from a car wreck into the greatest adventure of his life, and the archetypal heroes journey. He wanders through the baking Mojave desert, into the town of Dirt, inhabited by sassy, lovable creatures modelled after all our favourite western characters. He blunders his way into becoming the sheriff, and leads the whole town on a quest to locate their most sought after resource: Aqua. Verbinski directs with a snappy, take no prisoners sense of humour, throwing joke after joke after one liner after tongue in cheek nod at us, until we feel so bombarded with fantastic imagery, brilliant voice acting and just plain fun, that we more than feel like we're getting our money's worth. Each animal is beautifully designed, from the evil Rattlesnake Jake (Bill Nighy having a ball with a mini gun tail and Amber orange eyes), to Beans (a fellow lizard and love interest for our scaly hero), to the sleazy mayor (Ned Beatty, that old turtle), to a rampaging band of bank robbing moles led by a blind Harry Dean Stanton. The film is so full of detail, beauty and ambitious artistry that it has taken me at least 3 views to feel like I've noticed every character, every one line, very brilliant little touch. It's that good. Among the whacky antics there's a theme of owning up to ones identity, becoming responsible for people you save, and finishing the work or task you set out to do, lest you leave your legacy unwritten, and leave your Greek chorus (represented hilariously here by a trio of Mariachi Owls) with no end to their song. That kind of weight and thought put into an animated film gives me hope for the medium as something more than just whacky enjoyable children's fare, and even so I feel like like if more of the, had these kinds of themes, in them, our young ones may not necessarily understand the, but subconsciously benefit more off them, than off just the pyrotechnics and visual magic alone. A truly well made, shoot em up, dusty old American western animated classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Animation holds up even in 2022, teenager Western, not a kids movie","This movie is good, and give a classic nostalgic stop motion quality, with high level animation.Beware to show this movie to young kids. It is definitely not suitable for all ages. Language, innuendos and some scary part for the small ones.If you know Monster Inc you can see this as a more adult version of it. Although not as polished, especially on the beginning. Not every joke lands. But this is a goodmovie. The start is a bit cringe and really unrealistic, but the movie picks up pretty well after 20min .The animation is 10/10 absolutely top notch, amongst the best seen so far. And it hold up well in 2022. You can see that much works has been put in the production. Personally for my taste it lacked strong female characters, but it might have been a product of its time. The music is great: some mix of SNES RPG moods, with South Asian sounds and classic music with mariachi. Fantastic 10/10What sets this movie apart outside of the animation and music is the character development, it's genuinely well done. Where so many movies drop the ball Range nails it. Can't wait for a sequel.Should you watch this, probably not, but if you do decide to watch it. It is more than decent watch. And overall there's some memorable parts.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

A touch of class.,"This one was very much deserving of the 'Best Animated Feature' award at the Oscars. I would go as far as saying there is none finer; in the most skillful animated techniques and also for the Hollywood stars that do the voice overs (for each character). It makes subtle references to such iconic Italian Westerns such as 'Once Upon a Time in the West' but has it's own unique story and style. Containing the most vital and dynamic action in this particular and highly competitive genre Johnny Depp is the voice for a new Western hero, called 'Rango'.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fun and clever Oscar material,"Entertaining, Original, and Worthy Of An Oscar (which it won!) Few animated movies can produce such remarks. The tongue in cheek humor shines while smart references to Clint Eastwood and Apocalypse Now permeate the experience, and every scene had a grimy but extremely realistic attention to detail that made this film stand out compared to other animated movies.It is not good as Toy Story (what will?) but at least one director and one studio isn't afraid to make (giant) leaps in the animation genre to produce a timeless and entertaining film. Sure some kids won't understand the true ""spirit of the west"" or the countless references to high noon or The Good, The Bad, The Ugly, but for someone looking for an animated that has more than just stellar animation (Kung Fu Panda, How To Train Your Dragon; all good movies mind you), Rango nails it. This is what I would love to see from every movie. Pushing the boundaries so when we go to the theaters we are overflowed with cliché elements but wold with a fresh and incredibly original spin.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Good, gritty character designs that aren't the usual glossy clean and cute marketable Disney we're used to.

A Timeless 2010s Movie,"It's one of those movies that will appeal to everyone in the room.The animation style, while although seemingly too realistic. It's a style that just decides to venture extremely far than traditional hyper-realistic animation, resulting in a live-action style but still satisfying to see each frame of the movie.While the story doesn't really offer much anything new, it's a relic that you want to see in a Wild West movie even though it doesn't do anything extraordinary.But it's so incredibly symbolic too, it has so many meaningful things that you might miss on first watch; and then appreciate that you've missed them because the production team was talented at hiding them.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Brilliant and near perfect animated movie,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Rango"" (2011) in my opinion is not for everyone taste and not meant for the youngest audiences. This is the reasson why it wasn't big success at the box office back in the day. Altought it won well deserved Oscar for best animated movie of the year, the reasson why it wasn't big commercial succes is obvious. The characters in this movie are not ones typic Disney stuff. These are desert creatures and while stylized, the look like they came from real desert and not Disney cartoon. They look, smell and act like desert creatures. And they are charming as hell. The story was superb but its the screenplay that pushed it beyond. Its highly entertaining movie with incredible animation, voice acting and directing. At running time 1 h 46 min there isn't a singe minute that dragged. I only wished it was running longer.Overall, with tons of movies references, Old Wild West feel and tone, ""Rango"" in my opinion is one of the top animated movies that came in past decade. While its tone is light, the characters, screenplay and brilliant setting makes this almost perfect animated film. ""Rango"" is breezing with charm and is brilliant in every way.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Amazing Animation, but quite a few jokes fall flat","Rango, starring Johnny Depp, who is probably my favorite actor, is so far the best animated film I've seen so far this year. It's simple, Rango, a chamelion actor tries to cover up the fact that he is a coward by acting tuff in front of the local town of dirt. But he must learn why the water has dried up, and also must avoid the evil Rattlesnake Jake, who will come since the only bird keeping him away has been killed.First off, the film's animation is absolutely amazing, I mean, this matches, it may even outdo Pixar's animation. ILM did this, and man, they really know how to use computers. And I also found myself laughing quite a bit during the film, including a couple of cameos from a movie I haven't seen, but get the joke.However some of the jokes fall flat, they do end up having to use a fart joke, also, it was a little predictable, but only a little bit.

"Great Animation, Little Point","Rango's animation is perfect for a western world (with animals). And from a distance, the characters seem interesting. Too bad there's little payout from this film. It succeeds as a homage to westerns, but there's nothing to really take away from Rango. Our main character's story has been done dozens of times, and nothing new is brought to the table. His relationships are quite weak, even with his love interest. If there is any moral at all to the story, its modern society sucks, the wild west rocked? Alright.Other pet peeves include A. Some dumb jokes made by bit characters B. Lack of a satisfying fight with Rattlesnake Jake. C. A cop-out ending.Okay, its not that awful. Some of the action scenes are a lot of fun. And again, the animation is great. It may not be a bad way to pass the time. But if you are looking for character and plot, I find Rango very hard to defend.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

One of the Best Animated Films I've Seen,"RANGO is one of the most entertaining films I've seen so far in 2011. Following in the footsteps of Dreamwork's SHREK franchise, RANGO is an animated film that's fun enough for kids but has enough elements that appeal to adult audiences that we can enjoy it too. At it's core, it's a simple fish-out-of-water premise where a lot of the humor is derived from a stranger's interactions in a new land he doesn't quite understand. RANGO goes a little deeper than your average kid flick, creating an interesting and somewhat complex character. RANGO is about an ordinary household pet chameleon en route down a desert highway with his owners when a freak occurrence drops him alone in the middle of nowhere. He stumbles his way a rundown little town named Dirt, where the inhabitants are in the middle of an ongoing drought. Seeing his chance to inhabit a new role, the chameleon adopts the name Rango and passes himself as one of the toughest sharpshooters to ever live. His big talk lands him in big trouble when he is brought on as Dirt's sheriff and it falls on him to discover where all the water's gone.Let me start by saying that I've noticed a lot of people trying to say this isn't for kids...that a few scattered, very mild profanities and some peril are too much for young minds. Well, my four-year-old daughter loves it and she enjoys the film without mimicking the little bit of questionable content there is. I took her to see it in the theater and she's made me watch it at least 20 times since we got it on DVD. The complex themes of identity and destiny pass right over her, but she loves it when the hawk gets its head stuck in a can. I personally love it for it's attempt at being more than your average kid's toon. It's got some great tripped out sequences as Rango wanders the desert coming to grips with his dilemma, including one where he finds the ""Spirit of the West""...a little nod towards the man who defined the gunslinger genre: Clint Eastwood driving a golf cart loaded with Oscars and voiced by star of HBO's DEADWOOD, Timothy Olyphant. There's also a funny nod in the beginning to Johnny Depp's friend and drugged out gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson. I was surprised that I was the only adult in the theater that caught it and got a good laugh from the homage to FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS.The animation in this film is amazing. It's probably the best CG I've seen in a film. The textures, the cinematography, the character movement...it's beautiful. The inhabitants of Dirt are caricatures of characters we've seen in countless Westerns before, and the character design is hilarious. The visuals are fantastic and ILM has proved they could give other animation studios a run for their money if they can continue putting out quality films like this. The film boasts an excellent voice cast with Johnny Depp (Rango), Isla Fisher, Alfred Molina, Stephen Root, Ray Winstone, and more. Ned Beatty is Dirt's corrupt tortoise mayor, playing the villain again after last year's stint as Lotso in TOY STORY 3. Bill Nighy arrives in the final act of the film to steal every scene he's ""in"" as Rattlesnake Jake. I thought the man was awesome as Davy Jones in the PIRATES films, and he brings his evil to the coolest character in RANGO. My only problem with the film was that it felt a little too long and some of the drawn out parts could've been trimmed a bit to streamline the film. If you're looking for a film to watch with kids that won't bore you to tears or having you rolling your eyes, this is it.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Depp once again proves his range,"Rango is more than just a pleasant, well-conceived kids' film. I'm not even sure kids are the target audience. There really aren't any adorable animals afoot, although there is an obvious Bad Guy and a whimsical Good Guy. But there's a level of delightful sophistication that makes Rango a cut above most of its ilk - and, as a prize, it picked up the Best Animated Feature Oscar, so there's that.Rango (Johnny Depp) is a chameleon. Well, truthfully, we don't know what his name is; he merely adopts the name when he has to. See, our chameleon is really a family pet who finds himself stranded in the middle of the desert, alone for the first time. He wanders into an aptly named town called Dirt, a place that is naturally beset by bad'uns despite a paternal mayor (Ned Beatty). Our friendly chameleon, who has spent his life in a terrarium wishing he could star in a musical (seriously!) finds his acting prowess put to the test. Yes, he must become Rango, the daring gunslinger who has saved other towns in the Old West.It seems Dirt has a problem: little water. I know, if they had water they'd be Mud, right? True, true, but the critters who inhabit the town still need water, apparently, to farm and, you know, exist. Such denizens include lizards, iguanas, moles, mice, armadillos, rabbits, Gila monsters, and tortoises. You know, desert critters. Anyway, the town actually has a bank - a bank in which water resides. Citizens make deposits, withdrawals, and you get the idea. But the supply is running precariously low. Why is that?Rango to the rescue! I won't bore you with how exactly our chameleon susses out the situation, but let's say he takes the bull by the horns, suffers some indignities, proves he's not what he says he is, and maybe wins in the end. After all, it's an animated film that kids are going to be interested in, so don't expect a lot of violence or a detailed plot. It's not important.What is important, and what truly makes this a wonderful film, is Depp. If I didn't know any better - and I don't, really - I would swear he was ad-libbing all of his lines. Depp's patter is rapid, intelligent, witty, and delightful. Often, if an actor improvises and isn't up to it, you'll darn well notice - none of the made-up lines connect with each other or the rest of the movie, jokes fall flat. Hey, actors aren't usually writers as well. But if he or she is good at improv, then you get lines that seem even more natural than the scripted variety. For the record, John Logan wrote the screenplay, and since he was nominated this year for writing Martin Scorsese's Hugo, I think we can assume that the words we hear Depp speak are indeed from the pen of Mr. Logan. Most of them, anyway.Good supporting cast, too, including a creepy, oily turn by Bill Nighy as a rattlesnake; Beatty as the tortoise-mayor (who might remind one of Noah Cross in Chinatown); Isla Fisher as Beans, the nominal love interest who has catatonia as a defense mechanism; and Alfred Molina as a run-over 'dillo. Directing the shenanigans (his first animated feature) is Gore Verbinski, who directed Depp in three Pirates of the Caribbean movies.Kids will like this movie, although maybe those who are fans of shoot- em-up cartoons will take a greater shine to it than those who like love stories, but we're not going to stereotype here. Truth is, Beans is one of the toughest characters in the movie, much more so than poor Rango. In any event, Rango contains some scenes that may frighten small children (scenes involving the rattlesnake Jake, for example), but much more action and comedy than anything else, and even for jaded moviegoers it's a lot of fun to watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Great Adventure for the Whole Family,"Sometimes by brothers insistence surprises me and Rango was one of these cases. It was a late afternoon and my brother had rented Rango which i was already familiar with because of its star studded cast and impressive review. So after much argument over the television i gave in to watch this movie.I was truly hoping to be impressed and my wish was to be fulfilled in the first half an hour into the movie. Rango is about a Travelling Pet Lizard who is separated from his owners to be stranded in the middle of the Mojave Desert. He then after certain circumstances ends up in a small old western styled town called Dirt. He soon discovers that this rough and rugged town is in a major Water crisis. The problem seems simple until Rango becomes sheriff of the town through his overwhelming acting abilities, immersing himself into the mystery and adventure of the crisis making new friends along the way.This movies plot is wonderfully simple creating a comfort for the viewer. The humor contained in the movie is extremely well timed and adds the perfection towards the strange and wonderful character developed through out the film. Setting and visuals are beautiful and voice casting was flawless. Johnny Depp as Rango is up to his usual Brilliance accompanied by actors and actresses such as Bill Nighy and Isla fisher.The reason why i loved this movie was because it surprised me and its non stop action an the occasional laughs making it perfect for all ages. I give this movie 8 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Rather flat than fun,"After seeing a wonderful job by Disney in the from of ""Tangled"", me and my gf decided to go for another animation movie. Highly advertised cartoon with Johny Depp as a main hero voice served a good bait to pick this movie.The movie was flat, non-original and beat up. If you were not a fan of third part of Pirates of Caribbean opening scene, skip this one. The main character seemed to be highly undeveloped. Humor was OK, but not worthy watching. Battle scenes were stunning, but that also did not pull it out. Even Johny's voice acting proved that it is better to see him rather than just hear. I've heard far better voices that would suite this role far better.Finally, about 20 minutes before the end of the movie, quite a few people stood up from their seats and one of them even said ""I don't know how much you need to smoke to sit through this thing"".Bottom line: If you are looking for a good animation and haven't seen tangled, I suggest you getting it on DVD and staying home tonight.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

Rango unchained.,"For starters, 'Rango (2011)' just looks gorgeous; it's an odd yet successful mix of outlandish, exaggerated character designs and earthy, almost photoreal rendering. It has a unique vibe all of its own, though it obviously also pays homage to the western genre. It's actually strangely spiritual in a way, with a musical score that's as often introspective as it is bombastic and resonant themes of self-discovery, finding companionship and delivering deeds not words. Of course, the movie is also straightforwardly fun, with plenty of fast-paced action set-pieces and slyly tongue-in-cheek dialogue exchanges. It's really funny, too; there are several belly-laughs throughout. When it comes down to it, the piece is just incredibly well-made and equally as enjoyable. It really is a blast, as impressive as it is entertaining. It's great. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Peak Animation,"This movie entertained everyone in my family with the youngest being 8 and the oldest being over 70. I certainly enjoyed rewatching it 12 years after it came out now that I understand more references.Artistically the movie is outstanding with a great soundtrack (as should be expected when you combine Zimmer and Westerns), directing, animating and most importantly and notably: voice acting. While many of the voice actors were amazing at the very least, Bill Nighy, Isla Fischer and most of all Johnny Depp blew us away.Lastly and most importantly, the story was perfectly constructed. It won't blow you away, but it checked all of the boxes. It's like feeling full after a thanksgiving meal, as it leaves nothing more wanted (except leftovers, or maybe a long-awaited sequel; but I know sequels don't always pan out well). This story's got everything from a really powerful character transformation, a highly entertaining supporting cast, fascinating villains, and a well developed (albeit ill-expanded) love story. This is definitely my favorite animated/family movies, one of my favorite Depp films, and yes, even one of my favorite westerns.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

a worthwhile satirical take on the western genre,"Gorgeous photo-realistic animation, brilliant voice cast, quality humor and solid drama, Rango is a rewarding adaption from the western genre that respects its root while taking risks few animated films go.Rango is an ordinary pet who stumbles onto Dirt, a western town slowly dying from lack of water. With a knack for acting, he pretends to be a tough-talking drifter, utterly convincing that the townsfolk instantly believe his front. Through sheer luck, he manages to defeat a longtime enemy of the town, a hawk. After an unexpected victory, Rango become Dirt's sheriff, in charge of protecting the safety and well-being of his constituents. Turn of events during his authority uncover a sinister plot that lies at the heart of the town's hardships.Aside from incredible technical qualities such as the score by multiple Academy winner Hans Zimmer and animation looking like real life (the lighting in particular deserves rave praise), Rango succeeds because it treats its characters well by giving them relatable motivations instead of resorting to mindless slapstick comedy. Johnny Depp, playing the titular character, is a nobody who pretends to be a hero and becomes a true hero. The fact that he pretends to be someone he is not presents an angle of guilt to the character, but this does not get explored deeply during his stay at Dirt. The weakness of the film is really in this aspect. Most of Rango's character development occurs in the beginning and finale. However, the supporting characters are great.Beans, a resident of Dirt, drives the plot because of her refusal to sell her land to Mayor Tortoise John and discovery of a potential conspiracy to intentionally worsen the resident's living condition. The script did not make her a hapless female character, but a very strong one with convictions and principles. Tortoise John represents greed at its fullest, by cutting Dirt's water supply and killing anyone when necessary, even those who aid him in maintaining power, all in the name of unequal progress. Rattlesnake Jake is a paid outlaw who terrifies Dirt's residents under Tortoise John, but like Beans has principles, however wild they may be, when Tortoise John intended to kill him after nearly accomplishing his master plan. He is the catalyst for Rango to eventually find his true self by becoming the sheriff he was placed. Despite clocking less than 2-hours, Rango is also an epic drama involving characters outside of Dirt that makes the film a worthwhile satirical take on the western genre.Rango is obscenely good, perfectly made for both adults and children.8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Dark imagery and adult themes,"My fiancé and I took our kids (11, 9, 8, & 3) to see this movie today.

The adult themes and constant use of ""hell"" is definitely something that I don't expect in a kids movie. Characters openly saying ""Go to Hell"" and the owl mariachi band constantly saying he was going to die seemed more for ""shock"" value than to entertain children. Only a few minutes into it and we were wishing we had read more reviews and chosen another more ""kid friendly"" movie than this one.

I also love the way it is animated in a gritty style instead of a happy vibrant way like most animated films right now. The story is also great.

This is a very good movie that is a bit underrated and a fun family film,"Rango (2011) is a movie I recently rewatched with my daughter on Netflix. The storyline for this picture follows an escaped lizard from his safe family to the wild desert. He wanders into a town filled with local lizards that are struggling to find water. Rango talks himself up as a big tough lizard despite not being so and talks himself into becoming sheriff. Shortly after doing so he sets out to release the water and save the town. This movie is directed by Gore Verbinski (Pirate of the Caribbean) and includes voices by Johnny Depp (Blow), Isla Fisher (Wedding Crashers), Timothy Olyphant (The Crazies), Ned Beatty (The Deliverance), Alfred Molina (Boogie Nights) and Bill Nighy (Pirates of the Caribbean). The animation in this is absolutely outstanding. The setting are unique and a perfect place to lose your imagination and enjoy the diverse group of characters and animals. The dialogue is hilarious and well written and the movie also contains great sound effects. The story is fun and contains good twists and turns. The action scenes are also excellent and well done.

Beautiful Animation!,"The beautifully-animated Rango is one of the best animation films of 2011. I'm glad it won Best Animated Feature at the Oscars because it clearly deserved it. This is like one of those 1960's spaghetti westerns but this film is even better than those. I liked the fact on how many movies this film paid homage to. It is just worth the admission price to see the gleefully awesome ways on how this movie paid homage.Gore Verbinski's film is about a household chameleon stumbles across a town in the desert that is lacking in water. With inventive stories, Rango makes a name for himself and becomes an instant success and a hero. But, sooner or later, he is going to have to prove himself.This film has such a great voice cast. I'm not surprised with the Johnny Depp casting because he seems to be in every Verbinski film but Depp does the role just right. I liked the great supporting cast of Ned Beatty, Ray Winstone, Isla Fisher, Abigail Breslin, and many more.Overall, this is a smart, well-made animated film that ranks high in my favorite animations of all time list. This film is funny, witty, and has a great message. I liked the scenes which featured the narrating, musical birds. They were so depressing, but in a good and funny way. This is also an example of a western film done right despite the animation. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
You can't Tango with the Rango.,"This movie is easily one of my favorite animated movies of all time. When I first saw it at the age of like 6 years old, I enjoyed it. Now that I'm older I love it. Fantastic animation, great story, superb action and chase sequences, and a lot of humor. This movie has both intellectual humor, and potty humor. But like actual funny Potty humor. Like I don't usually find that stuff funny, but by some miracle they put a burp joke in this movie, that actually made me laugh. I don't think I've laughed at a burp joke in a good five years. There's one scene in this movie at the water Bank,(one that involves opossum) that I really admire, because I know several other animation companies I would have dragged the joke out far too long and made it unfunny. This movie knew when to stop. Also how did the rattlesnake Jake not scare me when I was younger? I can see that dude as terrifying, and there's one of very intense scene with him where he says a couple words you don't want your baby hearing. Overall this is a movie with a funny, entertaining, semi spiritual, story, and visuals better than what we have today. Well I mean I made this review in 2019 so that statement may be dated later.

Brilliant Animated Film,"I wasn't sure if I'd enjoy Rango as my wife had tried watching it previously and thought it odd and got bored. Well I can agree with one thing it definitely is a bit off or odd. Which I liked. I kind of expected as such from the previews and with Johnny Depp and Gore Verbinski at the helm.One film I would compare this to is Antz from around 10 years ago. Antz to me was one of the best early animated films in terms of writing and story. Great animation too. Technically I believe it was the first digitally created animated film. This one has a similar tone in its quirky off kilter approach to its characters and story. I find it also similar in that Rango has a very original take on its setting and characters.One thing you noticed, or should rather, is the immense detail in animation. I would easily says this gives anything out there a run for its money when it comes to textures, shadows, etc. Many of the animal characters look quite close to real if it weren't for their clothes and facial expressions etc. Regardless wonderful animation. Any shouldn't it be, it is after all the first film from Industrial Light and Magic which is ran by Lucas Films. I sincerely hope they put another one of these gems out.If you enjoy original and quirky characters and story this is the film for you. I wouldn't say it is necessarily for kids given some of the adult humor at times and just a general off beat and darker style that I wouldn't think would really appeal to a younger audience.

A Wild and Whimsical Adventure,"Rango is a film that deserves high praise for its imaginative storytelling and stunning animation. The movie follows the journey of a chameleon named Rango, voiced by Johnny Depp, as he embarks on a wild adventure in the desert.The animation in Rango is truly a sight to behold. From the detailed textures of the animals' fur and skin, to the intricate landscapes of the desert, every frame is a work of art. The characters are designed with a quirky, offbeat style that perfectly matches the film's wacky humor. It's clear that the filmmakers put a lot of thought and care into creating this world, and it pays off in spades.But what really sets Rango apart is its pacing. The story moves at a brisk pace, with plenty of action and humor to keep the audience engaged. The film doesn't waste time with unnecessary exposition or filler scenes; every moment feels purposeful and contributes to the overall narrative. Even the quieter, more contemplative moments are captivating, thanks to the expert direction and engaging performances.Of course, a big part of what makes Rango work so well is its fantastic cast of characters. From the titular chameleon, to the brave lizard Beans (Isla Fisher), to the fearsome villain Rattlesnake Jake (Bill Nighy), every character is fully realized and memorable in their own way. The voice acting is top-notch across the board, with Depp in particular giving a standout performance as the quirky and charismatic Rango.If there's one criticism to be made of Rango, it's that the film's humor may not be to everyone's taste. The jokes are often irreverent and absurd, and some viewers may find them more off-putting than amusing. However, for those who appreciate this kind of humor, Rango is an absolute delight.Overall, Rango is a visually stunning and wildly entertaining film that is sure to delight viewers of all ages.

"Stunning, dark Depp animated offering is no child's play...","Let's make this simple. ""Rango"" is one odd movie.When it comes to ""Rango,"" a theater full of bouncy young kids proves that marketing works - months of commercials pushing a wide-eyed chameleon voiced by Johnny Depp and supplanted by all manner of cheery dance tunes drove kids - and their parents - in droves to the premiere of the highly-hyped animated tale of reptiles, desert animals, and the wild west.After seeing ""Rango,"" however, and finding it to be anything but a kids animated movie, one can't help but wonder if most of those kids won't leave disappointed, their parents feeling mislead, and musing if even one of them will come back for a return visit. ""Rango"" is an odd-duck movie that's tough to endure once, but offers almost no compelling reason for a return visit.""Rango,"" to be sure, is a visually stunning, nearly photoreal production of a group of slightly scary ragtag desert creatures in a nearly dead town visited by a bright green chameleon stranger sporting an Hawaiian shirt. What follows is just under two hours of an oddly crafted morality play that is one-third classic Western, one-third ""Raising Arizona,"" and one-third Johnny Depp certified oddness. If ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" cross-bred with ""Finding Nemo,"" ""Rango"" would almost certainly be among the offspring.Oddly, in none of those thirds can you say that ""Rango"" is particularly funny. Sure, there are the requisite cute moments, but the photorealism of the creatures, and the intensity with which some of them are depicted, make drawing out a sustained chuckle a bit of an arduous task. ""Rango's"" dark theme isn't helped by moments where one wishes for the pace to accelerate - there's only so much computer-textured chameleon introspection you can tolerate in one movie before you start wondering, ""okay, what's next?""""Rango"" isn't a bad movie, but it isn't especially good, either.

Identity & Self-Discovery,"Rango is a film that breathes and lives imperfection. On the surface, it's a story of identity and self-discovery, as a lost chameleon stumbles into a gritty town and reinvents himself as the hero he never thought he'd be. But what makes Rango unforgettable isn't so much its themes-it's how the film revels in imperfections, both in its characters and in its storytelling.Corruption permeates the desert like a disease, ruling the majority of the characters, yet it's their blemishes and quirks that make them so recognizable and real. Everyone in Rango is gritty and imperfect, and that's what makes the film so unique. Dirt is a living, breathing community, not just because of its amazing animation, but because its people are messy, desperate, and flawed.My favorite aspect of Rango is that it's not a ""perfect"" movie. I would not want a perfect movie to be my favorite-my favorites are those that feature realistic struggles, confusion, and development. Rango tells its story in a very off-the-wall way, with surreal imagery that depicts both the journey and the mess thereof. Even the film's slower moments are warranted-just as the pace is starting to feel arid, the screen is filled with gorgeous shots of the desert.Few animated films are unique as Rango is. It's weird, it's quirky, and it doesn't try to conform to a perfect type. That's what makes it so great.Rango is my favorite movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

A western with animals done right!  It deserves Oscar Buzz.,"This is a movie that made my day. I never expected a good one so early on in the year! I hope that this movie doesn't get forgotten through the year. I wouldn't recommend it to children under the age of 6, but every one above is welcomed! The Good: The cinematography is just beautiful. A dark western just reeks out of the movie screen. The sunsets, the ideas of deceit from a controlling power is an interesting topic for an animated feature. The academy awards this movie deserves best animated feature, cinematography, art direction, sound original score, (TOO MANY HIGH HOPES, BUT THAT'S JUST HOW GOOD THIS MOVE IS.), and probably best picture.The Bad: The Cliché's. The western cliché's are outrageous, and well, nicely presented. The shoot outs, the clothing, Clint Eastwood (Oh yeah, Timothy Olyphant plays a great Eastwood.) There aren't any bad things in this movie I can think of other than the cliché's and the length. I wish the story was longer.The Ugly: The animals in this movie are not the most adorable little things like in most animated movies. They have crooked necks sharp fangs, old wrinkles and ugly faces. Very strange for an animated feature but that abnormality of it makes this movie special. The way the characters behave, there explicit innuendos are not appropriate for a kids movie.

Some will never understand them, but for me those made not only the evening but the week.A gem among the glass pearls coming from the States.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Simply Put...Bad,"For children under 5...the animation compared to much CGI even over 10 years later is incredible.Let me begin with the obvious I'd say it's safe to say that most children between 8-12 will not understand more than 50% of the vocabulary
Then understanding that suddenly what appears to be a pet lizard/chamilion (reminiscent of Flushed away but not executed as well) is flying out of the back of a ""Station Wagon"" car... Then finds himself having a philosophical existential conversation with whatever desert native animal it is he first encounters.The Chameleon survives and comes out on top with tremendous luck, a little bit of self-insight and intelligence and NONE OF HIS BIOLOGICAL SURVIVAL TECHNIQUES.Then if there's an adult still awake at this point, their very bored child will want popcorn, and twizzlers etc.John Logan and Gore Verbinski appear to be trying to make a masterpiece that meats no demographic but their own. This works for absolutely no demographic. Unless you are like fans of scam artists like Andy Warhall admiring toilet bowls and Campbell soup as ""Art"" and want to tell morons like myself that I missed the point. I would say ""Please Enlighten Me"" to which the Artsy person replies ""Art you get or don't..I cannot explain it"".Well if this is Art it's the Andy Warhall toilet seat and I have no problem flushing it.The script or story in summary is a bit complex, the vernacular utilized is almost like that of a Mark Twain Novel. The only clever message is that the protagonist is a chameleon (being from a house is out of practice nor utilizes his survival skill at all) and the only thing that's constantly changing is the approach attitude and behavior of the protagonist. He's an empty vessel from being a method actor for too long, he has no idea what he is or what he's doing.It also felt like ""side"" conversations were constantly interrupted by the imagination of the Chameleon. I don't get these inter species relations that don't coincide with reality...while emphasizing they are animals but are representing different types of personalities.Although the CGI was very realistic I think it would have to be kept to that level only with allegorical animals...A perfect example of being visually nightmarish was Tintin.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Wonderful movie, parents should research before hand if needed","My wife and I saw this movie last night and we both enjoyed it. Yes, it was slightly long winded at parts and yes, the humor was a little too dry occasionally but neither of these prevented us from enjoying the movie overall. The attention to details in the animation was amazing and visually speaking the movie was quite enjoyable.To all the parents complaining about the language and content, I question your ability to actually research a movie before bringing your children to see it. You seem to be too lazy to look up a movie beforehand and see why its rated PG and in this case its rated PG for rude humor, language, action and smoking. Seeing as how most of the complaints of the content fall into these topics, there is no one to blame here but you, the parent. People these days seem to have forgotten that PG stand for 'Parental Guidance suggested' meaning you the parent, have to make a judgment call of if the movie is right for your kids. I quote a Wiki article: ""PG - Parental Guidance Suggested - Some material may not be suitable for children under 10. These films may contain milder swear words, brief smoking, crude/suggestive humor, natural non-sexual nudity, short and infrequent horror moments and/or mild violence."" Hmmm...most if not all of those were present in this movie, yet most of you parents are complaining about them, even though you knew the movie was rated PG. Stop blaming movies, and start paying attention to movie ratings. If its PG or above, research the movie ahead of time, before taking the family. If you don't agree with its content, don't go.

"Rango, an animation for grown-ups","Rango is an excellent adult animation. Im not going to tell to much about the story but I can say:-The animations are OUTSTANDING and very realistic. -The story is original, fun and keeps you on the edge of your seat. -The characters are really convincing and detailed. -The voice acting is outstanding. -The trailers reveal nothing about the movie.It is a movie combination of a lot of westerns with a dash of fear and loathing...Me and my girl friend enjoyed it very much after some disappointing animations such as Despicable Me and Megamind.

Industrial Light and Magic's first animated film is a blast,"Pixar and Dreamworks has given us many great animated films like, ""Toy Story"" and ""Shrek"". But special effects company, Industrial Light and Magic, and POTC director, Gore Verbinski, teamed up to make an animated movie. The result: ""Rango"". A fun animated film.I enjoyed every moment in this film. Johnny Depp does a great and funny job as the titular character, Rango. Timothy Olyphant does a great job as The Spirit Of The West (He is also a reference to, ""The Man With No Name"", character). Bill Nighy does a nice job as the evil, Rattlesnake Jake. What really make's this movie really great, is the animation. It feel's like a live-action movie and it was all done by ILM. Not only it had impressive animation, but it was really funny.Overall, if you're looking for a good animated film to watch, ""Rango"", is worth watching.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A great animation worth watching again and again.,"When I watched the trailer for Rango, it looked like another kids animation. But when I actually watched this movie in theaters, it was a hit with the adults, rather than the kids. Even I was a fan of the movie, after watching it. It was heartwarming, funny, and the acting was top notch. Johnny Depp has stole the show once again. This may not be Disney, but it is the best animation movie of the year. The animation is really top notch, and there seems to be no flaws in it. Overall, this movie is a really enjoyable movie to watch with family and friends, just don't understand why kids think this was boring. I will give this movie full marks for it's acting and animation quality.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A lizard with a big heart!,"A good script always starts with a very dull moment, is not it? © I, like probably many other people, ""Rango"" interested in a very long time - not his looks strange lizards, and Johnny Depp, who was her voice, and the inscription on the placard: ""From the creators of"" Pirates of the Caribbean. ""If who ""Pirates"" and does not like, it's likely, for any not be able to say that the film was unprofessional. I was not prepared for what cartoon I do not like, but I was not sure of the return. Actually, I happy! Quite by accident and suddenly he is standing alone on the road. And it is not a fad. It just happened. Actor, he wore a red shirt and was pretty confident. But in the desert, where he was, there was no hope. Yes, and how to tackle it, if there is not even water! Handsome Rango was able to prove the first minutes of all the residents that he is a hero. And even became sheriff. With this and the adventures begin, full of laughter and imagination.Struck by the fact that there was a sense of presence - as if the journalists were reporting from the scene. For this I must say thank you to artists - an incredible atmosphere, hot and tart, was transferred perfectly. Each movement has been perfected and very clear, that was been noted many details, also played into the hands. Huge cactus - like Arizona, an orange umbrella, falling into a glass, a drop of water - and only seems to last; clockwork fish, palm curve and Gita beside her.Rango itself reminded me of Jack Sparrow - its charming gait and bizarre run - legs in different directions "", well, his awkward dance so all he brought me into raptures. Cartoon turned bright and memorable, and most importantly - funny! Stunning western! Theme music was also very good as the very statement - very original. The ending was struck - not the very essence, and those in which shell that are wrapped. There is no need to analyze the game actors, so we can only say that ""Rango"" - Cartoon about the meaning of life and water, the bright representative of the adventure genre, where there are tears and laughter, weird lizards and wild birds, the voice of Johnny Depp's voice is mixed with Isla Fisher. Stunning animation, very strong, worthy, who many will remember forever! Watch worth it!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Rango takes you on one unexpectedly great ride.,"This movie perhaps already is one of the biggest surprises of the year. It's a way better and more entertaining movie that you at beforehand would expect and on top of that, it's great looking and really wonderfully and professionally put together by director Gore Verbinski.It was a real surprise when acclaimed director Gore Verbinski announced his next project to be an animated feature. He had never done animated movies before and besides that, he worked with a company that also hadn't made a full length computer animated movie before. It seemed like this movie was a real dream project for Verbinski and with his influence and reputation which he had build up with his movies over the years, he persuaded the studios to give him the budget and creative freedom.And because the movie got done by a director of 'normal' movies why ""Rango"" is different and original. It isn't as fluffy as lets say a Pixar movie and it certainly isn't as clean and smooth. ""Rango"" is raw and prefers making its characters look dirty and ugly. A true western in that sense and by saying things look dirty and ugly I of course don't mean to say that the animation is bad. On the contrary really!The animations are done by well known and acclaimed special effects company Industrial Light & Magic, or simply ILM. Ever since their early days they have been the pioneers of special effects and even till this date they are still at the top of their game. Yes, still better than Weta or any other special effects company, in my opinion. They had of course worked with all of the techniques before but this was the very first time for them to create a full length animated feature. All I can say is; I hope it won't be their last! Everything is incredible looking. The backgrounds, the details, the characters, the action. It makes you wonder were it all will lead up to one day. Is it really possible that in a decade or so we get to see movies, or at least CG sequences, that can't be distinguished from real ones? Leave it up to ILM to pull that off some day! Animation-wise I even prefer this movie over a Pixar one, though perhaps you shouldn't compare the two, since they serve a totally different audience.Fore ""Rango"" isn't necessarily a kid's movie. You could still really call it a family movie but it are probably the adults who will be mostly able to appreciate ""Rango"" for its visuals, humor, characters and references.What I really liked about this movie is that it features plenty of references to other movies, in- and outside of the western genre but it aren't the usual, standard visual gags or dialogs you would expect. It's way more clever and creative with those moments and as a movie lover I was really able to appreciate that, though I'm sure I haven't even catch all of the references yet with my first viewing.It's a true western and not only just that; it's also one of the best western to have come out in the last couple of years! Not bad for a movie starring a chameleon! It really has a western look and feel to it, as well as a great sense of adventure. It's a movie I really didn't want to end.The story is actually quite simple and also quite formulaic, once you start thinking about it. There actually really isn't anything special or original about the story but it's simply done all so superbly that the movie still works out as great and perfectly entertaining. The movie can even be divided into many different parts. It starts out as a sort of goofy one, which children will like but after that the comedy gets soon replaced with action and adventure and the comedy gets pushed more to the background. It doesn't make this the most consistent movie perhaps but while watching it you don't even notice it, so it just can't be a complaint in this case. The movie simply works out very well and you get sucked in immediately by all of it and the strange world of talking animals, who dress like humans and live in the human world. No, this really doesn't make sense but this really doesn't matter at all. You'll get especially sucked in by the movie its action sequences, which are all really amazing, as is Hans Zimmer's musical score, which suits the movie so very well and it should really earn him his second Oscar out of his career!It's a movie with plenty of big names attached to it with its voice cast but most of them are actually quite unrecognizable. Even Johnny Depp's voice, who plays the main lead, isn't always that recognizable. This is really not a complaint though. Most of the time, big names seem only to be attached to these sort of animated movie so that they have a big name, which they can put on the the posters and advertise their movie with. But with this movie the people really seem to have been cast because of their skills and how well they fit their characters. It really lets the actors work for their money, so to speak and they are really acting and playing a character, instead of just voicing an animated character.And the movie does has some real great characters in it, who are all also great looking ones, with each a very strong and distinctive, unusual look.This is such a fun and just brilliantly put together movie. It will be hard for any movie this year to top this one! The movie even features a great montage and fart joke in it. Two things lot's of other movies can't ever seem to get right!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A real surprise,"I want to put this as simple as I can...Rango was great. I'm surprised that this movie came out so early in the Blockbuster season, it easily could be put into that category with a little more promotion. The animation was top notch and the voice-overs were spot on. They could not have had a better cast to voice the colorful characters in this adventure. While watching the movie I couldn't help but think of Blazing Saddles, of course for kids. The one thing I found upsetting was some profanity in the film, that really spoils some of the scenes. I wish films would't promote this language to kids, we have enough of it in society as it is, but now to start including it in films geared toward children is a little over the top. I am glad of one thing...it WASN'T in 3D. I was getting a little cross-eyed with all the 3D lately. I actually prefer to see films that are not 3D. I can't find the $3 overcharge justifiable. If you are looking for a great movie for kids or adults then Rango is the film you will want to go see. Outside of The King's Speech, this is the best movie I've seen so far in 2011.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Rango - great stuff,"Rango is not a just good movie, it's a amazingly awesome movie!I went to see Rango today, and I absolutely LOVED it! It was the PERFECT combination of humor, action, great voice talent, unbelievable animation, and over all GREAT quality. Rango is a perfect movie in EVERY sense! Rango should definitely win best animated feature for the 2011 Oscars, and at least be nominated, if not win best picture. The characters are likable and funny, it has a great plot (as well as many great sub- plots) Johnny Depp was fantastic, as usual, and so were Ray Winstone and Alfred Molina. My favorite part from the movie, was the riveting chase through the dessert canyons, it's a truly epic scene! I HIGHLY recommend Rango to ANY person on this Earth, as it is truly a superb movie!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Looking around in theater , there were a lot of adults, which I can see, b/c the movie wasn't for young kids, the guns(which i know it's based on western) were constantly being drawn and pointed at heads.

Cartoon Western? Yeah!,"After seeing advertisements of this cartoon, I was not expecting something special, I thought that this is the second version of ""WALL-E"" just fun. But in reality, ""Rango"" - this is something unusual, worth your time and money.Gore Verbinski master of his craft, and even with the cartoons he has not worked, but it has not affected the quality of the ""Rango"". Hollywood entrusted him with the ""Pirates""and now - 135 million for the cartoon! Screenwriters worked perfectly. John Logan has worked with cartoons, and his track record there are some seriously paintings such as ""Gladiator"" and ""The Aviator."" It is unknown who is James Ward, Tags, but once he is in the list screenwriters, it means that he put his hand to writing the script. The plot is interesting for its unusual, at first it might seem that ""Rango"" - the second ""WALL-E"", but it is already in couple of minutes. Yes, and cartoons in the genre of ""western"" almost there. I can only select ""Spirit"".The musical accompaniment also a very good level. But what can I say... Hans Zimmer was a composer of movie ""Inception""! It says a lot. Still want to thank the artists. Perfectly traced parts of the desert, animals, nice to look at all this, the eye rejoices. The artists of ""The Nutcracker"" need a lot of learning from the artists ""Rango.""After all this, wants to discuss the budget. He is great, but in this cartoon involving several great men, who had to pay big money. The budget must be recouped.Gorgeous animation, great story - it is only a few factors for which you must see ""Rango."" Animation is not just for children, but will be interesting to adults and grandparents. In general, do not be lazy to go to the movies for positive emotions.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Western High Jinx,"Picture it a western set in the desert with desert creatures playing out this tale of desperation and woe. Enter Lars (Johnny Depp) a chameleon looking for purpose a method actor of sorts, there's irony there somewhere.....Lars after a shock to his world and surviving an encounter with a hungry hawk bumps into Beans (Isla Fisher in excellent vocal form) who takes him to the town of Dirt a lawless town in the middle of nowhere with desperate townspeople struggling to survive against insurmountable odds. They are all desperate for the precious resource that is water....I mean come on there in the middle of the Arizona desert what did they expect? Through sheer luck Lars who has now taken on the name Rango, unwittingly kills the hawk plaguing him earlier in the story and suddenly hero status is thrust upon him along with the sheriffs' badge and he starts to really live up to the role. But the water which is kept in the bank is stolen and when Rango starts to investigate he finds mystery at every corner. Can Rango solve the riddle of the missing water and get the girl....or lizard girl.....and also save the inhabitants of Dirt? When I first saw the trailer to this movie I knew I had to see it and even though the trailer was vague I was intrigued with the animation more than anything else. This is special effects company ILM's first foray into the world of animated feature and when I say they have attracted and ensemble cast they definitely have gathered together some voice talent. Joining Depp and excellent Fisher are Ned Beatty, Ray Winstone, Abigail Breslin, Alfred Molina, Harry Dean Stanton and Bill Nighy to name but a few. The film is quite simply excellent and the animation is faultless, the dialogue punchy, witty and clever. The film is full of filmic references which are ingeniously placed, for instance when Rango is being knocked about the highway and momentarily hits the windscreen of a passing red Chevy Cadillac convertible whose driver and passenger bear an uncanny resemblance to Depp and Del Toro's characters from 'Fear and Loathing in Los Vegas'. There is also the spirit of the west, an eerie like character who bears a startling resemblance to Clint Eastwood, tobacco chewing drawl and all and a nod to the excellent Coen Brothers 'Raising Arizona' via the Carter Burwell theme. The story is clever and inventive and the voice acting is sublime with Depp, Fisher and Beatty shining ever so slightly above the rest of the voice talent on offer. I honestly cannot fault this movie it was hugely entertaining and my kids loved it and although it is directed towards the young ones there's plenty here to engage the more cerebral of you......and adults. 'Rango' is on general release so catch it now before it disappears to DVD you'll enjoy it....I assure you.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Alternate Title: Existentialism by Salvador Dali,"If you took Sam Peckinpah, Terry Gilliam, and Disney and put them all on Hunter S. Thompson's brainwaves, you would get Rango. Yes, this movie is as outrageous as it sounds. It's surreal, it's gritty, it's undoubtedly sneaky with its wit and humor, and its all the more fun because of it.The film stars a chameleon (Johnny Depp), going through an existential crisis, as he has lived his whole life in a terrarium. When that life is quickly—and literally—shattered, he finds himself walking in search of water. Instead, he finds a town called Dirt, where all the residents are plagued by outlaws and a severe lack of water, which is used as currency, it's so rare. Rango, seeking acceptance, assumes the role of sheriff, a role that has been played before, but with more unfortunate results. To make matters worse, someone is dumping water in the desert and draining all of dirt's resources. Who could it be, what is their diabolical plan, and is Rango really the unlikely hero of his own story?In case it wasn't obvious enough from this summary, the film's tone is surreal, complex and almost shockingly mature for an animated picture. It blends in so very many movie references, blending the gritty, revisionist western with the surrealism of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, a too-obvious comparison on the latter's part. Director Gore Verbinski had a unique way of producing and directing this picture: he gathered Depp and all the other actors on a sound stage, in various costumes, acting out their scenes, as a sort of visual reference. Depp affectionately—and appropriately—called this 'Emotion capture,' as it gives the movie a more natural, organic feel, as if the reactions were believable. When it's put on screen, it's full realized in both interaction and appearance.What most people have touched on when talking about the pros of this movie is, indeed, the stellar animationand, boy, is it stellar. Granted, some of the human cameos are kind of on the flat side, but our animal heroes are textured and expressive, which is important in this kind of movie. We can reach out and touch these sets if we were able; the roughness of the scales, the harsh desert heat and the sponge and spikes of cacti that crop up throughout are just a few of the details in this grand visual experience. The characters that make up this floundering town are actually interesting to look at and listen to, as the animation and awesome voice work give them all distinct and likable personalities.Resident include old prospector mouse Spoons, large, but quiet tomcat Elgin, morose, trigger happy little aye-aye Priscilla (Breslin), and, my favorite, the kind, but no-nonsense Beans (Fischer), a rancher lizard who finds herself falling for the goofy, but sincere hero. But, by far, the biggest fan favorite has to be Bill Nighy's rogue, Rattlesnake Jake, who is hands-down, flat-out scary in any scene he is in! How any kid will survive his scenes is beyond me! However, that made him more of a threat that Rango needs to overcome, which is more satisfying in the long run.Overall, while Rango has a few glaring problems (like seeing the Spirit of the West, who had been built up too much to show his face and be effective), Rango is easily one of the best movies of the year, if not one of the best-animated movies. It's surreal, but rewarding; strange but still gets the message across in a reasonable way that all can understand. Just don't bring the under 7 crowd, as it may be too odd and definitely too scary (*coughRATTLESNAKEJAKEcough*), but for those who can tolerate it, Rango is a trip that you soon won't be forgetting, no matter how many times you watch ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.""(I mean, you're already in a reptile house if you think aboutOh, never mind)",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"High marks in the animation and voice talent, but it is too long","This animated feature pretty much has everything that I hoped for when I walked in to the theater. The character design, modeling, lighting, texturing, and animating is flawless— almost photo realistic while retaining a cartoonish look. Much of the humor is aimed towards parodies of old westerns such as: the Spaghetti Westerns, High Noon, and Once Upon A Time In the West (to name a few). Even music from old Westerns is used, as well as some famous classical music pieces. Sight gags, one-liners, and even the sense of the absurd in some of the animation sequences are all incorporated into the film.The voice talent is simply brilliant. Johnny Depp's voice fits perfectly for the chameleon Rango. Ila Fisher follows through well with a southern accent as the lizard Beans. Abigail Breslin's adorable, young voice provides cuteness as Priscilla the Possum. Ned Beatty and Ray Winstone are great villains, but neither is as up to par as Bill Nighy for Rattlesnake Jake. He did a phenomenal job as Davy Jones in the Pirates films; here he is just awesome. I wish his character had more screen time.Unfortunately though, Rango runs into a big problem, the film moves too slowly. Usually, most animated features are no more than 90 minutes long. When they go past that point, they get boring. In rare cases, features such as ""The Incredibles"" move by quickly, regardless of the length. Rango does not have this talent. Part of this problem is due to the plot. The story is simple and nothing really unique, but it goes on way too long. Fifteen minutes needed to be cut.Another thing worth noting is that ""Rango"" is not a kid's movie. Though there are some sight gags, the fact it is animated, the humor is aimed more towards people who like the western genre. I grew up watching the old western pictures, so this movie is a real treat. People who are not familiar with the western films may not like this feature. In addition, some of the humor is adult oriented (some of it a bit much for a PG movie).Rango is a very good movie in my book, but it is not a major triumph like past works of DreamWorks and Pixar.My rating: 3.5/4",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Not for Kids, Not Exactly A Good Time","""Rango"" tells about a lonely pet chameleon with an active imagination who was one day suddenly thrown off his owner's car, and into the real world. His tall tales of deadly exploits make him the sheriff of a lawless rundown town of Dust in the Mojave Desert, which was having a water crisis. When the bad guys steal their last five days supply of water, Rango must now walk his talk and apprehend the bandits.This was a very strange animated movie. I do not think this was for kids at all. The theme and story were very mature, even the language (with minor cuss words). The drawings are not at all what we would traditionally call ""nice."" The characters were all not exactly pleasant little critters of the desert. There were scenes of hard drinking, cigar smoking, gun violence, morbid hangings and even a rather raunchy scene with a naked Barbie torso. I don't know if they thought the image of a armadillo gored in the midriff still talking was supposed to be funny.Rango himself is written and illustrated in a very irritating way. It was uncomfortable to look at him or those stupid things he was doing. It was as if Mr. Bean became a lizard. I don't know if knowing that it was Johnny Depp voicing Rango would really help. The lead female character Beans (voiced by Isla Fisher) looked like a creature from ""Avatar,"" but I have no idea what animal she was supposed to have been. Those momentary spells where she would blank out were more disturbing than funny.There were some good points too in this Gore Verbinski film. The cameo tributes to Westerns were good, like Morricone's music and Clint Eastwood. The villains were seriously well-written, especially the oily Mayor (Ned Beatty) and the scary Jake (Bill Nighy). There were some pretty witty one-liners throughout the script. While ugly, the details in the animal characters is admittedly intricate and shows a lot of hard work by the animators. Still overall though, I would not exactly call watching ""Rango"" a good time.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
what can i say.........,"what can i say Rango is pure beautiful, from the action sequences to sly humor, and to the magical visuals, this is a masterpiece on its own account, this is what im talking about with an animated movie, and thank the baby lord Jesus its not in 3d, and no im not saying i hate 3d im just trying to figure out why all these animated movies and most live action movies are 3d, some movies 3d fits, and maybe rango could've been put in 3d but as roger ebert said rango is some sort of miracle it works its characters and situations just like real life, and everyone can relate. Im glad this movie is not in 3d, it just shows people to respect regular old school animation. This is one of the best movies of this year so far, and also the best animated movie. will just have to see what rio, kung fu panda 2, and cars 2 can whip up, and yes I know this is kind of early to be talking about but I think rango may win best animated feature at the Oscars , but like I said will have too wait and see what happens. oh and go see this movie, and yes I mean now. ***** out of 5 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disappointing,"I was so excited to see this movie. I have a 7 and 8 year old and they are in to cowboys right now. My husband is a huge western movie buff, so we thought it would be a great flick to go see together. Boy was I disappointed. We all were.I went expecting to see a fast paced, funny, western cartoon. I think the only thing out of those three I got was the western cartoon. This movie is not geared towards kids. However, the advertising, the animation, and all the previews I saw were!I *think* that they may have been going for the next ""Up"" style movie. Where they are trying to create an entertaining movie for kids and adults with a much deeper message. I got the message, but missed the entertaining part. The other option is that they were trying to create a really bad, boring western. If so, they succeeded!The animation is good. Some of the characters are a little weird to look at, but when you're trying to humanize lizards and such, I guess they are going to look a little weird. I also thought the sound effects were well done. The storyline has so much potential, but the movie is about 30 minutes too long. Because it was so boring, the kids in the nearly sold out theater were antsy and loud the last half of the movie which did not help the experience much. You really couldn't blame them, though.Really bummed about it, we had looked forward to Rango since we originally saw it advertised in December. The kids didn't enjoy it, the western movie buff husband didn't enjoy it, and neither did I. I did, however, leave the theater really wanting a drink of water!!!",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
It was surprisingly...just surprisingly,"Almost accidentally I ended up in front of the big screen to see this movie.

It was surprisingly...just surprisingly! Normally I find myself having a hard time laughing during these movies, due to the somewhat childish way it is presented. With Rango it was different! This movie just worked for me. Somehow the humor in it was not ""too much"" (for example like the donkey in Shrek, that's to much for me) and well timed!Even though the storyline is pretty predictable, the way the storyline is presented is new(ish).

Best Picture Nomination Coming,"This is really the best movie that I have seen in years. Far better than most of the 2010 nominated movies.

It has some not quite Felliniesque surreal moments and darker undertones missed by my 8 & 10 year old. The animation and movie score are fantastic. There are a number of moral themes that will be appreciated by adults even if missed by children. Some of these themes are greed, environmental destruction and hanging of the innocent.

I expected another boring badly animated something, But after a first few minutes I realized that this thing is actually worth watching.I've heard a lot of people complaining this movie is not suitable for kids and I agree with them. It's not. But using all this so called bad language didn't really bothered us, not only because English is not our native language and my sis doesn't really understand what they're saying, but also because ''Go to hell!'' or ''Damn!'' aren't really that bad. Kids will most definitely hear much worse things in school or while listening to their parents fighting, so that's not really that much of a problem. They're also to young to understand all the sex jokes and if they do, well, then it shouldn't actually bother you, as they already know too much. As for the killing, death and such, I believe they've seen worse. On local news maybe? What makes this movie not suitable for little children is the story. They just won't understand most of the jokes, references and they won't follow the story in full as it's somehow complicated and not-so-straightforward.On the other hand, this movie is great for a little older audience. Especially all the adults, who have grown up watching all those westerns and have seen them coming into the cinema (and, of course, liked them) will enjoy it. It's full references and jokes connected to pretty much every suitable successful movie out there. Even I was able to find some funny references, although I'm a bit too young to understand every single one.The characters are kind of cute, in their own way, and the chameleon as protagonist - well, that's just awesome. Oh, and I just love the animation. I'm kind of bored watching the same-looking characters all the time. There is some more diversity here and that's what I love the most about it. It's a bit different, but hey, that's what's all about, right?As for the end - this is one of the best movies I've seen so far. The characters, the story, even the background make a perfect combo. The only reason, why I gave it a 9 is the fact that there is no warning that the content is not suitable for younger children. But what the hell, it won't kill them if they see it.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Funny, weird, fun (in a weird kind of way...)","'Rango' is typically one of those movies that can't quite be categorized into this or that little genre of comedy. Obviously, it's an animated film. Is it a kiddie movie? Well kind of. Allow me to elaborate. The film starts off absolutely hilariously, with an accident, half a road kill and a journey through the desert turned into a maniacal chase as soon as a hungry hawk gets wind of Rango's presence. After meeting a lovely lizard named Beans, he ends up in the small town of Dirt. Where, after a good deal of bluff and dumb luck, he is appointed sheriff. So far, no harm, no foul, just good comedy. In fact, nearly-wetting-my-pants-laughing-out-loud-comedy.However, at this point is where it all turns just a little bit haywire. No real damage done, just a small sense of cluelessness as we go along. The story continues as though Gore Verbinski and John Logan were just trying to think of as many weird situations as they possibly could whilst forcibly trying to mash it up into one, cohesive storyline. Truth be told, seems like they were trying just a little bit too hard. It actually gets even a little bit boring here and there, where the pacing kind of sinks in up to the point where it all comes together and starts to make sense again. (Mind you – this could also be due to the fact that I was watching the extended version, not the theatrical one, but still.) But fear not, no real quality is lost, as 'Rango' provides some of the most excellent and funny characters I've ever seen in an animated movie. They also rounded up a perfect voice-cast, with Johnny Depp who doesn't sound anything like Jack Sparrow, but still adds the same kind of awkward quirkiness to his character. Alfred Molina's part is small but vital, and I'll bet you've never heard an armadillo with a perfect Mexican twang before Bill Nighy is awesome as Rattlesnake Jake, and you can even hear a little bit of Davy Jones coming through sometimes. One of the best parts however, is done by Ray Winstone as Bad Bill. Who would expect some Wild West bad guy to have a cockney accent? Brilliant.Another thing I must mention is the superb animation. Without a doubt the best I've ever seen from a non-Pixar production. Heck, even if it was Pixar it would have been their absolute best so far, and that's saying something. The animation parallels – or, dare I say, even surpasses – Finding Nemo. That's right; I said it, so sue me. Yep, Industrial Lights & Magic made a fan out of me.Now, back to the original question – is it a kiddie movie? Yes and no. Some parts are totally hilarious and will have your youngsters rolling over the floor with laughter. Other parts will sail right over their little heads as they are very much grown-up humour with references to classic films and jokes they simply won't get. (Is it just me or did I catch a tiny reference to Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas in the beginning?) Another factor is that some of the humour is a little grim and quite mature for small children, with some of the creatures smoking, swearing and even getting shot and/or killed. Now, personally I don't know any children who would be upset by any of this, they see things that are much worse on a daily basis on the Disney channel. But then again, I'm not American, and it is my understanding that some American parents are hugely bothered by some of the elements in this movie. So I would recommend that you simply watch it first and then decide if you would like your children to see it. But honestly, I would try not to be too sensitive about it, it doesn't get scary anywhere and none of language or behaviour is really that bad.All in all, 'Rango' is definitely a fun ride, and one of the few animated movies that will entertain as many adults as it will children.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Rango is a Bingo...,"Ever since my eyes met the poster of ""Rango"", this film never stopped to tickle my curiosity. I made a poll about scariest looking not-meant-to-be-scary posters and ""Rango"" seemed like a good candidate, but it made me wonder: how on Earth could such an ugly-looking creature be ever conceived as a major animated protagonist? Rango is not 'Shrek ugly', Shrek is monstrous in a cinematically appealing way, but Rango looks like a chameleon and I don't think these animals would make it in the Top 20 bestial beauty pageants, even by Disney standards, a chameleon IS ugly.But then again, why shouldn't a chameleon be the hero? Why should the requirements of drawings affect the narrative status, and as a matter of fact, what it is with the whole reptilian universe's snubbing, aren't we tired of cute, fluffy bunnies and proud and majestic horses? One of the good things about ""Rango"", and there are plenty, is that the film redeems a whole fauna that has been severely overlooked by animation: the creatures from the desert. The setting is a town named Dirt and its populated by the flotsam and jetsam of bestial society: toads, rats, lizards, bats, turtles and beavers, even the rodents are drawn in the ugliest possible way, but these are the animals who fought the hard way for survival, centuries and centuries of evolution, but in ""human timing"", it fits the Conquest of the West period. And what better a setting than the desert for a great Western story?And if ""Rango"" is all built on Western archetypes and some from other genres (and that includes one of the best takes on ""Apocalypse Now"") these references aren't the end but only the means, it's all in the story. And this is why I'm glad I finally watched ""Rango"" because I never really put my finger in what left me perplex in ""A Shark Tale"", and now I got it, it's one thing to make references to countless movies and the more of a movie lover you are, the more likely to enjoy them you are but here, no reference feels gratuitous and it's always combined with a bit of originality that belongs to the film. ""Rango"" has a story to tell, it takes it seriously enough to get pretty dark and handle such serious themes like death, thirst and progress and it knows how to loosen up when needed to. In other words, it's adult material; I doubt the film would appeal to little children, but this is finally a movie that aims the adult world in an intelligent and fun.Starting with Rango, that little guy is one of these original creations that immediately grow in you, a chameleon who is a hero in his own world, he rehearses it with a headless naked Barbie doll, a dead cockroach and a mechanical fish but the heart isn't in it, he know what lacks: conflict, a pivotal moment, a journey starter. Basically, Rango anticipates his heroic status, he's like the voice of his own writers, his voice-actor, Johnny Depp and his ""Caribbean Pirates"" director Gore Verbinski. He is an obvious creation, and the presence of the singing owls as a Greek chorus reinforced the artificiality of Rango. But when the action takes off, when an armadillo crosses the road, and the tank where Rango lived get out of his owners' speeding car, Rango is thrown on the road, gets out of the comfort zone but gets 'in the picture' and becomes his own creation, the journey begins and things start to get fun.The armadillo shows him the way where he can meet his destiny, the West so Rango moves forward, he meets a hawk, a toad, a bottle of coke and finally, a cute female lizard named Beans, whose particularity is to freeze like a defensive move. But she's more than the soon-to-be love interest. The film plays with archetypes but never without substance. Take the great saloon entrance, Rango is eager to make an impression, he then brags about how he killed seven outlaws with one bullet while everyone listens with admiration, he is hilarious not just by the speech he makes but the enthusiasm form his listeners. Every character in this film has something to say, in most animated films, you have the protagonists and the rest are just space fillers with occasional one-liners, in ""Rango"", you feel like each one's story would have made as good a film.So ""Rango"" becomes the sheriff, and the plot gets more surprisingly thicker and complex with a scheme you wouldn't see coming, let's just say that it involves water and the antagonist is obviously based on Noah Cross from ""Chinatown"". Out of all the movies parodied in animated features, this is the last I would have expected, and when the Mayor says that he uses water to buy 'the future', I didn't even think of Chinatown, I was drawn out by the film, and I was wondering why is it that Tarantino gets screenplays nominations for a thing like ""Django Unchaines"" and a film like ""Rango"" gets none. Well, it still won the Best Animated Feature Oscar and rightfully so.But I wonder if it would have won over the 2010 Disney films or in 2012, this is obviously a film that is 100% original which is more than you can say about Disney and Dreamworks, and it's a film that stands so high above the usual movies for kiddies that it deserves a special spot as the most original cartoon and the riskiest. Indeed, you can't even merchandise ""Rango"", and that's why I love about it, it's a film whose priority was to have a unique look and feel. In the end, it is a unique film.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The best non-Pixar animated effort in years.,"Rango is not a real name, only a pseudonym. A pseudonym chosen in haste by a chameleon stranded far from home and under pressure.But as he has selected the name that is what I will use.Rango is a small, skinny, goggle-eyed chameleon with a large angular head perched upon a crooked and frail looking neck. He is articulate yet clueless, self confident but unsure at the same time.Suffice to say that his quick tongue tends to get him into more trouble than it extracts him from.The story proper starts when Rango – though at this stage still a nameless house-lizard – is thrown from his safe but bland pet tank in the family car. Stranded and initially alone Rango takes advice from a near roadkill and heads off into the harsh and inhospitable desert. It is there that he finds himself in a small Western style town. The town of Dirt. Where water is so rare that it has become a currency, albeit an ever increasingly rare one.After some dealings with the locals and a run in with a hawk, Rango finds instant credibility with a town in need of a hero after he ad-libs his way through the tale of how he killed the Jenkins boys with a single bullet.All seven of them In recognition of this newfound renown an elderly turtle – ahem – 'the Mayor', dubs Rango Sheriff and gives him the task of guarding the town's ever diminishing water supply.Then the water goes missing Rango was unexpected. I didn't actually even plan to check it out but got roped along when Battle:Los Angeles was packed. The film was extremely entertaining and funnier than any animated film I can think of off hand. Johnny Depp absolutely slays as the titular reptile, with a scattergun delivery and a voice that is part Hunter S Thompson, part Willie Wonka (there is even a Hunter S Thompson nod in the early going).I found myself chuckling along at non-jokes simply because of his ridiculous intensity and the alternating cocksure boasting and increasing desperation as he realises he is a lizard out of his depth. But don't worry, padding out the non-jokes are several real ones, a few cracked me up and thankfully they weren't painstakingly built and obviously looming.The animation is incredible. Each critter (and there are a great many) is rendered beautifully – even the incredibly ugly ones – and feature amazing detail. Funnily enough the most 'cartoony' is perhaps Rango himself, though his buggy eyes tend to tell a story all of their own.It mattered little to me but this is definitely not the flick to park the kids in front of for an hour. There are numerous nods and winks to adults, which I recognise Pixar does too, but these are distinctly more 'adult'. The afore-mentioned Hunter S Thompson cameo, a pretty graphic vision of the near-roadkill and several other moments that depending on viewer age might be considered scary or gross. Let's just say I know of a 4 year old and a 6 year old that I wouldn't accompany to the theatre for a viewing. (Maybe 8ish might be OK? But I'm guessing.) Again I didn't see Rango coming. It was a surprising blend of fresh and different comedy in unexpected surroundings, capped off by a superlative voice job by Depp and quality work from a cavalcade of stars including Isla Fisher, Bill Nighy, Alfred Molina, Ray Winstone and even Timothy Olyphant pulling off a very worthy Clint Eastwood impression. This is all only enhanced still by some of the best animation and character design that I have ever seen.It will require a second viewing before I would be willing to elevate Rango to 'Great' status, but at this point I am happy enough to state that this is the best film so far this year. (Alright Winter's Bone was better but it sure wasn't this much fun.) Final Rating – 8 / 10. This tale of a colour-changing lizard's journey to find himself and save a small town isn't as kiddie as it might sound. The best non-Pixar animated film so for many years.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

... BUT NOT AS MUCH AS YOUR DADDY'S COOKING!,"This movie is funny AF!!! Hilarious ! I LOVE this movie! In my opinion it's one of Depp's funniest roles. Even funnier than ""Jack Sparrow."" You will barely stop laughing at one thing before you're dying over something else. I have an extremely broad sense of humor and I will have to pause the movie to finish laughing and catch my breath before I start again. Yes, kids can watch it, but most of the humor would go over their heads. Actually, a lot of it might go over a lot of adults heads too. There are many many references to other movies that are fun to notice, and a star-studded cast too like ""Ray Winstone"" who is just awesome, and a badass. If you somehow haven't seen it yet, and you haven't already drank the Kool aid, then give it a watch. If you still watch SNL and think it's funny then this isn't for you.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not for children (or adults),"I had expected something dark and intelligent from the way in which this film was promoted. Instead, the vileness of most of the characters, the hapless hipness of ""rango"" and the stunning violence just made me cringe. Typical gross effects for the folks who find that amusing were scattered throughout and the asides that could have had substance, had only pandering ""cleverness"". My suppositions, mostly because Johnny Depp was the ""star"", were trashed. I suppose some would find merit in the creation of the characters - would that there had been something to like. Rango's love interest was the only creature with any soul and what she found attractive in the bravado and ineffectualness of that little lizard left me speechless.

Animation and Western at its best.,"This movie i can define in three words. Amazing. Funny. and Inspiring.
A well-conducted story about a camaleon who overcame his fears in defense of the people he just met, but has a tremendous relationship.
Usually in animations, the creators tend to make the characters more smootly and visually clean, like they're all perfect, which they don't. We don't see any of that with Rango. All the characters have their own scars , bruises and imperfections that makes us wonder on their past , and how did they get that scars.
Simply this is the best animation i've seen so far.

This movie sucked so hard! The only reason I watched it is because IMDb users rated it so high! FAIL!,"What is wrong with you people that gave this movie glowing reviews? I had such high hopes and left the theater feeling robbed, and completely dissatisfied. It was not funny at all. Barely. I may have had a light chuckle once or twice, but no bellyaching laugh attacks as I was hoping for. First of all, I have amazing taste. Secondly, I have an awesome sense of humor. And finally, I am an easy crowd, meaning it doesn't take much to make me laugh, so trust me when I say this film failed big time!

A spaghetti western... with a lizard as the lead,"Rango is not only in love with the spaghetti western, but with movies in general. There's a scene in the opening that plays tribute to Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, a ""bat scene"" later that winks at Apocalypse Now, and numerous nods to Sergio Leone's westerns throughout the course of the film. Rango is a passionate movie that's passionate about movies.This in no way suggests that Gore Verbinski's latest doesn't stand on its own two feet. To date, it's by far the most interesting and unique film I've seen in 2011. While it does play tribute to many predecessors, it doesn't let the homage make up for its lack of narrative. John Logan's script is full of character and wonderful, delectable dialog that dances off the tip of the tongue. As with ""True Grit,"" I found myself wanting to quote the film after I saw it, displaying my movie ""geekiness"" for all to see and judge me by. Logan, to my surprise, also injects the film with a level of surreal that makes it more interesting compared to many of the other mainstream animated films being released today. In fact, I dare say the script and narrative is quite daring. Younger children may not only be confused by the path it takes in terms of storytelling, but also miss much of the banter and humor in the film. I haven't said this about a non-Pixar animated feature for what seems like some time now, but Rango is quite intelligent. It doesn't speak down to its audience with the obvious. Sure, there are somewhat predictable plot twists and turns (anyone who has seen a handful of the aforementioned spaghetti westerns of years past will notice similarities to Once Upon a Time in the West, The Man with No Name trilogy, etc.), but the story is presented in a very interesting manner.Despite the fact that the film is computer generated, much of the ""puppetry"" in the film reminds me of the Jim Henson films of the 80s. The creatures are so full of life, so detailed, and so wonderfully molded into their roles. The animation style--thanks to the imaginations of James Ward Byrkit, David Shannon, Eugene Yelchin, and Mark McCreery--has a strong and significant impression on the film. Rango, quite frankly, looks unlike any other animated film I've seen. Additionally, the style helps to compound the surreal nature of many of the films events. John Logan's script and the visual/art style work together in perfect conjunction.As far as direction goes, Gore Verbinski's fantastical style that dominated the look and feel of the Pirates films is here is in prime form. In fact, there's a scene that involves our lead lizard and rolly pollies that reminded me of a certain Davey Jones' Locker sequence in At World's End. The action set pieces show off all of the experience Verbinski has garnered over the course of directing the swashbuckling series. I haven't felt as exhilarated by action/adventure scenes since I last watched an Indiana Jones film. I constantly caught myself grinning like a fool during the more frantic moments of the movie.When it comes to the voice acting, Rango is sublime. Bill Nighy, in particular, does outstanding work as Rattlesnake Jake. Ned Beatty is perfectly cast and comfortable with voicing the Mayor of 'Dirt.' Without spoiling anything, the biggest revelation for me was who lent their talents to bring a voice to the Spirit of the West.One thing that ultimately separates Rango from the majority of films I've seen so far this year is that it's memorable. It's been a day since I've seen the film and I'm still chewing the film over in my mind. Rango is a number of things--a feast for the eyes, stimulator of interesting vocabulary, etc.—but it's primarily a fresh experience despite having an assortment of familiar themes and plot devices at its disposal. It's fun for all ages and rewards older movie buffs just as much, if not more so, as its younger viewers.A final note: As a demystified final buff, it's become a rare occasion for me to desire to give a film an immediate second viewing after finishing the first but I instantly wanted to do so with Rango. I hope others, movie maniacs and general audiences alike, get this urge and amount of enjoyment out of the film.Related Recommendations: A Fistful of Dollars, Once Upon a Time in the West, Tombstone, Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl, Fantastic Mr. Fox, Coraline.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Not for your kids, but adults will love it!","In the 21st Century as we are of today, we got many gadgets that help our lives more easier, even for all of the recents of animated and live-action movies. Which also means that western films are dead to us expect for the grown-ups who lived their whole life watching it.In Nickelodeon Movies' newest flick, Rango; that's become of another story.Rango tells the story of a chameleon stuck in a little town better known as they called it Dirt; he makes himself a sheriff and goes by the name of Rango.Pirates of the Caribbeans co-stars Bill Nighy and Johnny Depp join forces once more with their old director Gore Verbinski (whose also directed other movies like Mouse Hunt, The Weather Man, The Ring and The Mexican.) in this oddly weird picture as we called it an animated movie.Rango may look like an innocent children's film due to the PG rating, but it's more than that. Think of the Legend of the Guardians when your watching the flick, but with swear words thrown right into our very own faces.How is it they get away with it you may ask? Who knows? But Rango is not as bad as you think. Other than the good pep talk it's gotten since it's release in spring-time, this is not something a little child should be seeing. Teens will laugh and surely adults too will probably wind up falling for it.On my watch and in my book, Rango deserves it's 9 out of a 10 for me.

Let's Tango with Rango,"Greetings again from the darkness. I just can't believe it. Last year I was raving about Toy Story 3 being my favorite film of the year and now here I am again extolling the excellence of an animated feature. However, Rango is a different experience ... these are all new characters and a whole new look for animation. I would even say this is more a film for grown-ups than for kids, though kids will certainly get a kick out of Rango, a colorful chameleon energetically voiced by Johnny Depp.This story and film pays homage to many classic movies and especially to spaghetti westerns. You will easily spot the tributes to Star Wars, Apocalypse Now, Hunter S Thompson, Sergio Leone, Lee Van Cleef, Clint Eastwood, High Noon, and of course Chinatown. The main story line is nearly identical to Chinatown ... the control of a town's water. Here we get the Mayor, voiced by Ned Beatty, in the John Huston role. For film fans, this is just so much fun! Rango the chameleon is a very likable character who just wants to be liked. He dreams of being a hero so that people will look up to him. Of course, he learns the hard way what being a hero really means. The town of Dirt, the desert, and multitude of characters are all fantastically drawn. There are times the film has a look of live action with terrific lighting and detail.The voice acting in the film is truly outstanding and it starts with Depp's fine work. Also contributing are Ned Beatty (Mayor), Bill Nighy (Rattlesnake Jake), Isla Fisher, Abigail Breslin, Stephen Root, Alfred Molina (Armadillo), Ray Winstone, Charles Fleisher (from 1988 Roger Rabbit) and Timothy Olyphant as the Clint Eastwood character no-named Spirit of the West. There is also a useful and very funny Mariachi band that pops up periodically to push the story along.Director Gore Verbinski is known best for his Pirates of the Caribbean movies (with Depp) and he really gets to go all out on his visual style here. He is helped along by George Lucas' Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) and their first foray into animation. Heads up Pixar ... you have definitely have some tough competition!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Loved it.,"I thought the film was fantastic. The only downside was that it was perhaps a little long in terms of development. It took a while for the final ""hoorah"" to take place, but that didn't bother me much at all. Getting to that point was an exhilarating ride and I enjoyed every moment. The story, while classic, was interesting. The characters were multi-dimensional, and the images were breathtakingly crisp. Depp's voice was a perfect match for Rango. He creates this comical character with his voice, but yet one that the audience feels for in every capacity. We want him to win, and we want him to be happy. I totally recommend that everyone see this movie. As a last point, the graphics are a little creepy so perhaps younger children should be kept at home, but everyone else, make a point to see this movie. - Jables",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Really? Animated Pirates of Caribbean with Wild West background?,"I couldn't stand this movie almost right from the very beginning. Most of all, because I directly got the hint of Jack Sparrow in that Rango fella. And amazingly, it's that Depp who (again) took the role of Rango, although it did not surprise me. The movie went from trying to be funny to serious to unbelievably unrealistic and in the end to cool. Sorry people, I am not gonna buy that. It's spot on Pirates of the Caribbean all over again, albeit packed into just one movie ( I do hope so). It's already irritating to see someone copying others' ideas, but i think to sell the very same thing again and again with different package is beyond irritating, it's insulting. I was surprised to see that a lot of people found the movie to be awesome. It's obvious that they will attempt to do this kind of fiasco again, and of course with the same people all over again.

The storyline is very well put together, with just enough comedy that's understandable for younger children and just enough action to keep you entertained without having to make the rating PG-13. The character of Rango very much showed traits of Jack Sparrow, probably Depp's most well known character from Pirates of the Caribbean, and was definitely appealing and easy to relate to for the audience (we all want to feel like a hero sometimes!).

The Must See Movie for Every Family,"I, My wife and my daughter went to see Rango over the weekend because it was the most well-reviewed movie currently in theaters. The first impression I had of this film was two-fold, funny and weird. A lot of the humor, the story, and the concept is completely off the wall and strange. Eventually I realized that this film is basically a love letter to the classic Spaghetti Western. Once I had realized that, the film became much easier to digest for me. We really loving it.The characters were very well developed. One of the most brilliant ways they were able to create a character was with Johnny Depp's voice acting of Rango. The script was good, and he simply made it more so. They were able to create a compelling and interesting character out of a character that, in fact, has no foundation whatsoever. Rango is completely empty, void of any kind of interesting background save for the one he creates for himself. Out of that, they created a character that you love and want to root for. The others characters, who all came complete with actual backgrounds and goals, were equally satisfying. The antagonists were as fun to watch as the protagonists, and Rattlesnake Jake was a stroke of pure genius.The best parts of the film was their handling of the Spirit of the West. Without giving anything away, the Spirit of the West was perfectly and beautifully portrayed. I loved how, using Timothy Olyphant as the voice of the Spirit, they were able to reference the passing of the baton, so to speak, from classic westerns into modern westerns. The face of the Spirit combined with the voice was the perfect homage to the western genre.My Family love films like this and Wall-E, films that slap us in the face and tell us that there is something seriously wrong with modern society, and do so in a way that makes sense. The need for change in our everyday lives is long past due, and I love when our art reflects this.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Shakiest Lizard in the West,"I do not always understand Roger Ebert's penchant for his overuse of the **** rating, but I still take it in consideration when deciding what to watch. I was in the mood to see something in the theater and this week did not seem to have an overriding amount of films that screamed watch me. So I thought instead of watching the poorly reviewed Battle: Los Angeles, I thought I would see what Ebert stated as ""... some kind of a miracle: An animated comedy for smart moviegoers, wonderfully made, great to look at, wickedly satirical, and (gasp!) filmed in glorious 2-D."" His rating is, of course, too high, but the movie is a fun and pleasant experience.There is nothing tremendously new or original in the plot. While the anthropomorphism of the various animals thrown together help make it seem they are in their own unique world, film fans are going to notice this is not the case though they probably will enjoy the huge amount of references to other material. Johnny Depp plays Rango/Lars a lizard that had a comfortable existence as a kept lizard in an aquarium with a headless doll and a fake fish for a companion. A near accident in a traveling car causes his habitat to fly out and crash amongst the highway leaving him to bake, shed skin and half to dodge traffic. There he meets an armadillo half ran over on the road (that has to be a little much for young kids) who is a Don Quixote character (another reference to a Johnny Depp project) who sends Lars on his way to meet his destiny.Destiny is a woman lizard named Beans who has a quirky trait which is really just an instinctual behavior gone wrong (she freezes at inappropriate moments). She leads him to a western town that is drying up from lack of water. In fact water is the most important currency there and unbeknownst to the two folks the bank's reserves are almost out. Lars finds himself in a saloon and with his acting talents and his need to not get killed he creates a fake bravado and a monstrously tall tale of heroics. At this point I am reminded of Don Knotts in The Shakiest Gun in the West (IMDb wrongly states that the character was Barney Fife influenced), but of course it also reminds me of the original The Paleface (had to have at least one Bob Hope reference).Through happenstance and just plain luck the townsfolk thinks he is a majestic hero after he dispatches a ravenous bird and gets made sheriff by the town's mayor (Ned Beatty doing an obvious John Huston imitation from Chinatown). However, someone is stealing the town's water and with the bird gone an outlaw rattler has no fear to come back to the town. Will Lars (known in the town as Rango) succeed? Is there any question to what will happen in the film? Probably not, but it is still fun.This is not really a film for kids though. I was paying somewhat attention to the children's and parents reactions and it seemed the parents made the stronger laughs and comments. I wonder if anyone else caught the Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas reference. Some of the scenes are a bit strong for PG and in some of the reviews I have read (Modesto Bee for example) they like the film but pan it because it is not for kids.The animation is quite good and it helps to be seen in the theater. While the storyline is a bit trite and perhaps a bit too much material is derivative (even the score is quite reminiscent of Ennio Morricone), there are enough superlative scenes and humor to make this a worthwhile cinematic venture. Heck I might go so far as to say this will probably be nominated for an animated Oscar, as long as the Academy can remember a film before September.Other random information: I have to mention former Modesto native Timothy Olyphant as the voice of The Spirit of the West (I wonder who he is imitating).",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
NOT for kids!,"I took my 10-, 7-, and 2-year-old children to this movie and regretted it from the moment the first (of many) ""Hell"" was uttered. The animation is fantastic and the references to old Westerns was nice for the adults...and these are the only reasons I gave this movie a 2. I would not take a child to see this movie. It was slow, violent (including showing a child putting a gun in her mouth, and attempted suicide by walking into traffic - obviously NOT things you want your kids to learn) and too many four letter words to count (i.e. ""Sign the damn paper!"" ""Go to Hell!""), sexual innuendo, etc. Not sure who they wrote that movie for, but it wasn't for kids. If you're an adult who happens to enjoy animated movies, go for it, but get a sitter for the kids.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
Smart Satire,"""Stay in school, eat your veggies, and burn all the books that ain't Shakespeare."" RangoSo this is where smart satire is hiding: in a low-key animation released at the worst time of year for movies (between January and May). It's Rango, with the gifted voice of Johnny Depp in the titular role and veterans such as Ned Beatty voicing the villain.The inspiration for this witty oater is the water plot of Chinatown buttressed by such chestnuts as High Noon and spaghetti Westerns, most notably the ones with the Man with No Name. Depp's Jake is a hapless drifter whom fate sends to a very dry Western town, Dirt, to help the people find water that has mysteriously vanished. Be it Los Angeles or Dirt, it's probable that a no-good businessman like Noah Cross in Chinatown (John Huston) or in this case, the mayor (Ned Beatty) has taken it for himself to get deeds to land that people will eventually give up for lack of water.The allusions and dialogue from those westerns and Chinatown come faster than even the best film geek could digest in one sitting. Adding the Apocalypse Now Valkyries scene gives richness outside the Western motif. The faces of the various animals, a chameleon for Rango (Depp), turtle for mayor, and snake for town tough guy, Rattlesnake Jake (Bill Nighy), are just a few of the many richly detailed characters. In a way, the Pixar influence is all over the film with the attention to individual characters and plot points that reveal those characters rather than serve ingenious animations.My favorite is the Eastwood homage in the No Name role, a laconic, weathered old guy riding a golf cart, not a horse. At the point that Rango sees a city over the hill, as in the Cliff Robertson Twilight Zone story of the wagon train seeing a gas station, director Gore Verbinski and crew have fused more than one great film to a great TV series, and the irreverent reverence is complete.Take the whole family to this fun movie. It's the old-timers like me, though, who grew up on Westerns, who are going to smile the most.",,Anonymous,Animation
"This is a smart, hip comedy that works for adults and kids.","RANGO(a film review by Mark R. Leeper)CAPSULE: A pet chameleon falls from a truck in themiddle of the Nevada desert. He soon finds his wayto the dying Western town of Dirt where his braggingand his lucky defeat of a predatory hawk make him thetown's new sheriff. Sadly, the town is drying up forshortage of water. In the best Western traditionSheriff Rango sets out to save the town. Sight gags,film references, jokes, action, and just plain funnystorytelling follow as thick as a hail of bullets.Director Gore Verbinski shows his animation directionof John Logan's script is as good as his live-actiondirection on films like PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN.This is a smart, hip comedy that works for adults andyoungsters alike. Rating: high +2 (-4 to +4) or 8/10RANGO is a ""funny animals"" sort of animated film, but the writing and situations are funny enough that it might turn out to be one of the best animated films of the year.In a world like ours (but where intelligent talking animals live side-by-side with humans) the chameleon who comes to be called Rango (voiced by Johnny Depp) would like to be an actor. He dreams of a life in front of a camera. Then his habitat terrarium rolls off the back of a truck and he finds himself stranded in the dry Mojave Desert. He wanders into the animal-run frontier town of Dirt. Swaggering into the saloon he tries to play the part of a Western tough guy. He brags that he killed a gang of seven outlaws with a single bullet. In a fight with predatory hawk Rango lucks out and kills the hawk. The townspeople now believe his bragging and want Rango as their new sheriff--failing to tell Rango that his predecessors named to that job may have lived to regret it ... or not.But Rango probably won't have his job long. Dirt has some real problems. Rango comes to the town just as Dirt is parceling out to its citizenry the last few days of water. When the water source dies the town will soon follow it, and that day is less than a week away. Meanwhile the mayor (Ned Beatty) of the town seems to still have big plans. He tells Rango that who controls the water controls everything.Okay, let me digress here. This is what THE INCREDIBLES called ""monologing."" It is a major weakness in the writing. This statement is the key to everything that is happening in the town. In his anxiousness to make sure the viewer knows what is going on writer John Logan has the mayor saying exactly the wrong thing to the new sheriff. It is not hard for the viewer to figure out who the villain has to be just by his appearance. This is virtually a confession before Rango even knows there is chicanery going on. And part of the chicanery is the stealing of the plot of CHINATOWN. Another part is the counterfeiting of a cameo appearance that had me fooled. Timothy Olyphant does a spot-on impression of another famous actor. I found completely convincing, and I am generally good with voices.There were several familiar actors voicing major roles. Besides Depp, Beatty, and Olyphant, there was Isla Fisher, Abigail Breslin, Alfred Molina, Bill Nighy, Steven Root, Harry Dean Stanton, and Ray Winstone. Animation directors seem to feel the public needs familiar voices to appreciate the characters. I frankly doubt that most viewers pick up on all these voices. Admittedly some of these are very good actors. But the film industry is full of good and deserving actors who are out of work. I personally think that it is bad for a successful actor to accept a voice-only role that could go to an actor less successful.It is good that animated films are starting to be considered acceptable for adults with or without children to see. Some of the best writing is going into animated films. I often find myself in theaters seeing animated films where my wife and I are the only party without children present. Good writing should be savored and appreciated and there was really even too much good writing for anyone--adult or child--to take in on one viewing.Smart, crafty, hip, and full of wit, RANGO may be one of the best films of the year, animated or live action. I rate it a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale or 8/10.Film Credits: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1192628/What others are saying: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rango-2011/Mark R.

But I was shocked by this movie, very very good and I hated the commercials and trailers but this movie is so much better than it looked in those ads. It is hard to describe and I don't want to give much away but it's a comedy and existentialist drama and it's for adults and children. Go see it.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Of (Anthropomorphic) Mice and Men,"Anthropomorphic animals are the bread and butter of the animation industry. Ever since Walt Disney found a cash cow in Mickey Mouse, the medium has tickled audiences with talking critters that span the breadth of the animal kingdom. But Rango, the titular chameleon of Gore Verbinski's cartoon western, is something of an anomaly. The gangly, photorealistic bipedal lizard didn't graduate from the ""Bambi"" school of cuddly creature design. Voiced by Johnny Depp in rare comedic form, the character is defined by beady eyes, a sharply crooked neck, and a gaudy Hawaiian T-shirt.Refreshingly, Verbinski doesn't constrain himself to Pixar's particular reality. The brilliant Disney-owned studio has set the gold standard for computer animation over the last 15 years, capitalizing repeatedly on an effective storytelling formula that put a magnifying glass over insects, fish, and rats, among others. Any of those films could be retitled, ""The Secret Life of _______."" Competitors followed suit, with ""Madagascar,"" ""Bee Movie,"" and a slew of other me-too efforts.""Rango"" turns the overcrowded genre on its ear. Despite being gaspingly more realistic- looking than your average doe-eyed Disney endeavor, Verbinski's flick doesn't stage its critters in a cartoon facsimile of the real world. Instead, the film takes place in some skewed dimension wherein humans exist, but might as well not save for their ever-present eco- footprint. The film is scaled to fit its characters and can't be bothered to stop and explain the origin of its windswept desert town in miniature. It's easiest to think of ""Rango"" as a modern (comedic) western in which the constituent players just happen to be scruffy rodents and scaly reptiles.The world and its inhabitants may be grimy, but what makes ""Rango"" such an endearing experience is its irreverent and offbeat sense of humor. Verbinski, who cooked up the story alongside screenwriter John Logan, borrows a page or two from the Coen brothers; Rango's faux eloquence is reminiscent of Nicolas Cage or George Clooney's character from ""Raising Arizona"" or ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" respectively. It shares their dry wit and a surrealist dream sequence reminiscent of ""The Big Lebowski"" too.Those qualities highlight that ""Rango"" is not a movie especially geared at children. From its litany of literate film references including ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""Chinatown,"" and ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" to its seriously scary baddies, the film rejects kiddie convention outright. Younger or more sensitive viewers may be frightened by Rattlesnake Jake (Bill Nighy), a venomous villain with a six shooter for a tail, and parents might object to the mild swearing.But by my estimate, ""Rango"" is a near-perfect kids' film. Looking as far back or further than the Grimm brothers' macabre fairy tales, the impulse to shield children from potentially off- putting content is a relatively recent development. Verbinski runs the entire emotional gradient here, exploring moments of loneliness and fear as well as adventure and jubilation. Important themes all in the human psyche. Of course, much of the humor will go over the heads of young audience members, but the copious slapstick certainly won't. In the end, it should play well to just about everyone.That is, everyone who's in the market for a conceptually challenging cartoon. ""Rango"" is unwieldy, occasionally unfocused, and also the first great film of 2011. The anthropomorphic animals that comprise its world are less a reflection of the Mickeys, Bambis, and Nemos of years past than of the Waynes, Eastwoods, and Fondas. Verbinski, who famously teamed with Disney for their ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise, steps out of their shadow for one of the most clever, fun, and original animated epics of the 21st century. And with the sequel to Pixar's least loved film on deck for this summer, our favorite Hawaiian shirt-wearing Chameleon may need to don a tux this time next year.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Rango -- There's No Western Like It,"I realize a review is supposed to talk about the movie, but indulge me for a moment.I enjoy Westerns. But, that wasn't always the case. My mother of all people turned me on to the virtues and value found in ""Bonanza"", ""Cimarron Strip"", ""The Big Valley"", and ""The Virginian"". Later, I would discover what made everyone from Sergio Leone to Clint Eastwood cool. I came to respect the romance and intrigue inherent in the genre; rarely was I turned off.It's that much more pleasing when the genre is taken in a different direction. We have an excellent example this year! It starts with a neurotic pet chameleon (Johnny Depp), naturally well-versed in drama and portrayal. Cruel fate sees him stranded in the wasteland, literally guided by voices, as he spends an amusing opening trying to survive. A chance meeting with strong-willed rancher lizard Beans (Isla Fisher) gets him a ride from the sewer to the toilet, a last-legs town, appropriately called ""Dirt"". There are water problems as well as outlaws aplenty. Mr. Neurotic lays eyes on a label in a saloon, spins a few tall tales, and Rango is born! After more dumb luck sees him nail a hawk and run toughie Bad Bill (Ray Winstone) and his gang off, Rango becomes a name in the community.But, can he figure out what's behind the water shortage? He's on a clock, since to said outlaws, a sheriff's star may as well be a bulls-eye.Prior to rushing out to see this, I heard a couple of pre-cog complaints about ugly character designs. That's easily answered, along with many other stigma you true believers may be having. First, if you are into clean, perfect, ""attractive"" character design and execution as displayed through the rose-colored, 3-D VR helmets borne of the PIXAR/DreamWorks debate, stay away from this film. That goes triple for you parents looking for the next animated film before which to plop your kids down, where any animated film will do. Don't do it. Save money and gas...go see ""Toy Story 3"" for the twelfth time.None of that here. Just as men are men and women are women in the Old West, ""Rango"" is it's own film. More ""Shane"" than ""Shrek"". More ""Foreign Correspondent"" than ""Finding Nemo"". It's gritty. Raw. Filthy. Surreal. Disturbingly violent at times. But with just the right amount of well-placed humor to break it up. Gore Verbinski's trademark pacing, put to increasingly awkward use in the ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"" franchise, works surprisingly well here. Equal attention must be paid to animation director Hal Hickel and the ever-improving staff at ILM, as they trade firm handshakes with art director John Bell and production designer Mark McCreery in the successful effort to craft stunning, unforgettable visuals, accented by outstanding lighting, which puts the fruit of the current 3-D, hi-def craze to shame. The not-so-original, yet solid story receives further grand support from a sweeping score by the winning Hans Zimmer and the further contributions of co-producers such as Mark Bakshi. (Yes, he's related to that Bakshi. Those in the know need not hear anything further. The rest of you, get to Googling.) Everything about the film cries ""unorthodox"", including the performance of a highly capable cast, who actually performed their scenes on sound stage, near-to-unheard of in animation procedure. Keep eyes peeled for humorous set pieces and important cameos. This is well worth your repeat viewings.So, head on west. But leave the kids at home to wrestle with PIXAR, DreamWorks, and the other juveniles of the terrarium.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Ride Valkyries, ride","When a mangy chameleon ends up in a desert town called Dirt by accident his dreams of becoming a hero may suddenly become true. The town is in dire need of a hero - the water supply has run dry and the last of the stock is nearly gone. But is he up to the task or is he about to bite off more than he can chew? Animation at its finest this film combines elements of classic Western films with modern day animation and plenty of elements to keep the children in the audience happy. Like most modern animation it combines elements for a more adult audience with elements for a younger audience and it does it very well.The adventures of Rango and the other denizens of the town are a fun story and the way everything comes together is compelling enough to make for a fairly long film - and there's plenty of space to introduce events that mimic other classic films, paying tribute to the better things that film industry has to offer.Very good stuff, 8 out of 10 roads crossed",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A Quick-Witted, Clever Piece of Animated Cinema (Just Mind the Kids)","Nature seldom shows mercy to its inhabitants. Every organism must adapt quickly to survive in the wilderness or die. Life is typically short for most members of the animal kingdom and when evolution momentarily halts, every resource is sought for to survive. ""Rango"" understands the facts and gleefully expresses them to us on screen. It's difficult to calculate how long it took for the creatures of ""Rango"" to wear Western clothes and handle guns but who am I to judge a creative animation flick in such a scientific way. Yes, ""Rango"" is the new name of the West and it resonates swiftly across the land. After concluding the ""Pirates of Caribbean"" trilogy, director Gore Verbinski and Johnny Depp reconnect to abandon the sea and embark on a vibrant adventure across the sands of the desert.Johnny Depp voices Rango, a pet chameleon who aspires to be a thespian. He knows he can be anybody he wants to be but he feels confined by his limits. After a freak accident, Rango becomes lost in the middle of the Mojave Desert. He finds a small town called Dirt but realizes ""strangers don't last long around here"". Instinct tells Rango that he must quickly blend in before he is ostracized or worse. He manages to improvise and assumes the identity of a gun-slinging legend that has brought down some of the most notorious outlaws with a single bullet. The townspeople (or townscritters) find hope in Rango's actions and false reputation so they urge their Mayor (a tortoise voiced by Ned Beatty) to appoint him as Sheriff. Rango now runs a town in the middle of drought where the low supply of water is controlled by the Mayor who has devious prospects in mind.If you recognize the references, you can tell that ""Rango"" is a parody of some of the finest films ever made. As a nod to ""Apocalypse Now!"", a Western banjo ensemble performs the infamous ""Ride of the Valkyries"" tune in an aerial attack scene. That's what I look for in parodies these days: clever and creative takes on past movies, not mere mentions. The water conflict in ""Rango"" is practically identical to the plot in ""Chinatown"" and Verbinski is considerate enough to model the Mayor's clothing, mannerism, and quotes after John Huston's character, Noah Cross. However, ""Rango"" mainly lampoons the Western genre with a keen respect for the movies and legends (keep a look out for one particular legend). Instead of men on horses, we see small creatures ride roadrunners into the setting sun to thrill us with nostalgia. Because there are people wanting to see an exciting cowboy flick, Verbinski delivers all the goods needed to satisfy the hungry fans from wagon chases to quick-draw dueling.As usual, Johnny Depp prevails as a character who desires acceptance above all else. I am assuming because of persuasion by Gore Verbinski, Rango has a Jack Sparrow moment or two. Since Rango is a self-described actor, Depp masters numerous dialects to transition from one identity to the next. The act tells us that Rango is a ""lonely lizard"" who is unsure about himself and his future. It's no wonder why Depp has become the one of the world's most talented living actors. Rango's love interest is a desert iguana named Beans (voiced by Isla Fisher) who, of all the citizens in Dirt, is the most skeptical of the water crisis. The trouble with Beans is her continual wide-eyed expression throughout the movie accompanied by her malfunctioned defense mechanism. Nevertheless, she is the only sign of staunchness in a suffering town. All the voice-actors perform effectively and seem to embrace their roles. The stand-out, besides Depp, is Bill Nighy as Rattlesnake Jake, a legendary diamondback with fiery eyes and a pistol-cannon as his rattle. I knew how well Nighy can act before ""Rango"" but I had no idea that he could brandish a menacing, Western accent in place of his Scottish tongue.The CGI, provided by Industrial Light & Magic, in ""Rango"" carries a precise elaboration to capture the glorifying environment and content of the film. There are some scenes with a hallucinogenic beauty on a grand scale which further intensify the spectacle of the whole picture. Composer Hans Zimmer doubles the delight with his striking, Mexican- Western style score to sensationalize the art while a mariachi band of owls melodiously narrates the events as they unfold. The screenplay is written by Academy-Award nominee John Logan who has lent his hand to projects including ""Gladiator"" and ""The Aviator"". Logan's script is loaded with bullets of witty irony and bright pop-culture references while he critiques the weaknesses of financial institutions and the political uses of religion. ""Rango"" provides a less-than-satisfactory amount of physical humor for the kids. To be blunt, not a lot of children are going to understand the humor but the adults and some well- informed teenagers will. The Johnny Depp fans are going to have a blast more explosive than a handful of dynamite.My Rating: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"If you like movies, you'll love Rango","Don't be fooled by the PG rating, or the fact that this is an animated movie. This is a film for adults. Picasso supposedly said ""good artists borrow, great artists steal"", (he may have stolen the line from someone else) and this movie makes unashamedly wholesale thefts from a number of movies and books. Start with the writings of Carlos Castaneda, flavor with a heavy dose of Clint Eastwood spaghetti westerns, blend in a rather strong resemblance to the plot from Chinatown, season to taste with Star Wars, Blazing Saddles, Bugs Life, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Indiana Jones and High Noon. The next time I see it I'll try to make a list of all of the other references. If the movie was boring you would at least be entertained by trying to guess where it all came from.Despite the movie's rather complicated family tree, it all hangs together very well. If I were pitching to a studio, I'd say it was ""Carlos Castaneda versus Noah Cross"".And oh, by the way, the voice acting and animation are as good as I've seen. I just finished watching a rental copy on DVD and I can't wait to buy it on Blu Ray.Literate and funny, this is a movie that aims much higher than the typical summer animated fare. HIGHLY recommended.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Wacky and delightful, this Wild West adventure is a giddy burst of creative imagination unlike anything you've ever seen before","Proving that there is no such genre which cannot be turned into an animation with the right creative imagination, Gore Verbinski's ""Rango"" is probably one of the first ever animated Westerns- and what a giddily delightful burst of imagination it is! Indeed, there is so much to admire and appreciate about ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" director Verbinski's latest reteaming with Johnny Depp that multiple viewings is probably a must.The titular character voiced by Depp is a domesticated lizard living in a terrarium with a broken doll and a wind-up orange plastic fish. When we first encounter him, Rango is dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and acting out scenes from Shakespeare to kill time; though in between reading the Bard, he also displays a propensity for soliloquies. It turns out that Rango's aquarium is in fact on a moving vehicle, and a sudden swerve leaves the coddled pet chameleon stranded in the middle of the Mojave Desert ready to begin his journey of self-discovery.Right from the start, it is clear that John Logan's screenplay (working from a story by Verbinski, James Ward Byrkit and Logan himself) isn't going to be of the run-of-the-mill family-friendly type. Indeed, Rango's journey turns out to be a surprisingly mature and thoughtful one, as Logan shows that he isn't afraid to delve into complex themes of identity and existentialism- one of the oft-repeated catchphrases in the movie is the appropriately deep saying ""nobody can walk out of his own story"".That's not to say Logan has put aside his sense of humour here, though the jokes also tend to be geared towards a more adult audience. Yes, one doubts that the kids will find the suitably titled armadillo Roadkill (Alfred Molina), whom Rango meets in the middle of a busy highway, amusing; or a fellow desert creature cursing Rango ""son of a -----"" with the last word replaced by the shriek of a hawk hilarious- but Logan's deliciously quirky story comes with sharp dialogue and distinctive wit.Both are clearly evident in every turn of the story, starting from Rango's arrival in the town called Dirt. Populated by a menagerie of lizards, rodents, amphibians, reptiles and other desert creatures, Rango proceeds to impress the desperate citizens of the town with his made-up tale of derring-do, and promptly gets himself appointed sheriff. His first task? To solve the town's most pressing problem- water.Water is pretty much Dirt's most valuable resource, not only their currency of trade but also the commodity which makes up their reserve in the Bank. Of late though, it's been especially hard to come by, and it soon occurs to the citizens that someone's been stealing their precious supply. Rango's closest equivalent to a sidekick is a fellow lizard named Beans (Isla Fisher) and she suspects it has something to do with the town's Mayor (Ned Beatty), a wizened, wheelchair-bound turtle who tells Rango on their first meeting that controlling the town's water supply is akin to controlling the townsfolk.There are definite plot similarities to Roman Polanski's 1974 classic ""Chinatown"" and indeed they are not coincidental. With ""Rango"", Logan and Verbinski pay homage to the classic spaghetti Westerns from John Ford to Sergio Leone- there's even an appearance by the Man with No Name (voiced here by Timothy Olyphant doing his best gruff Clint Eastwood impersonation). Particularly notable too is Verbinski's tribute to the helicopter attack in ""Apocalypse Now"" in his staging of a thrilling action sequence with flying bats- and this as well as other subtler references will certainly please film buffs.But Verbinski's greatest accomplishment is in creating a fascinating world intricately designed with so much rich detail. Working with his ""Pirates"" visual effects wizard Mark McCreery as production designer, Verbinski's Dirt town is steeped in the classic iconography of the West- bars, billiards, and saloons- while simultaneously unique in its variety of denizens. Industrial Light and Magic was behind the animation- this their maiden effort- and they have done a beautiful job with the characters.Whether reptile or amphibian, each creature is distinctively rendered, and despite the scraggly look on each of them, there is more than enough loving detail in each sets them apart. Credit must also go to veteran cinematographer Roger Deakins who serves as visual consultant, and gives the desert environment the same kind of visual dynamism that he captured in the Coens' Westerns ""No Country for Old Men"" and ""True Grit"".""Rango"" also stands out from other animations by having its actors record their voices in costumes and actual sets together, rather than record their respective parts in sound booths- and Verbinski's decision has paid off handsomely. The delivery by the ensemble cast (including Depp, Molina, Beatty, Fisher, Harry Dean Stanton as the patriarch of a rodent gang and Bill Nighy as the menacing rattlesnake Jake) is sharp and well-timed, and lend that added zing to Logan's dialogue.And certainly with Logan's uniquely quirky and mature story, Verbinski's lively storytelling, as well as Johnny Depp and the rest of the ensemble cast's outstanding voice work, ""Rango"" is a rollicking Wild West adventure packed with humour, wit, and excitement. Remember that burst of creative imagination that you saw in the first ""Pirates""? Well, Depp and Verbinski have brought that same spark to this latest collaboration, and their newfangled take on the Old West is a delightful burst of creative imagination that will go down as one of the most original works of animation you'll see this year.www.moviexclusive.com",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Animation that's fun off beat and different it's the ""Rango"" way!","""Rango"" is one of those movies that's fun, different, unique and off beat it tells it's story in a different way really it's animation and computer graphics and CGI use at it's best. And true animation and big screen cartoons aren't my favorite type of films still every now and then these type of pictures are worth a watch. ""Rango"" tells a wild west story of good against evil the up and coming lawman and the bad mayor with cowboys and it has a theme pattern of ""High Noon"" and ""True Grit"" only it's done in animation! Yet it has the stars in it they just look different as characters in the wild west town of dirt. Johnny Depp is just fine and the beauty Isla Fisher plays a damsel in distress she even has a scene where she's tied up and gagged! Overall an okay little treat movie that's fun and unique to check out.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Human physiology,"A Satirical Take on Class Divide
Rango is a comedic gem that, beneath its humorous exterior, offers a sharp critique of societal class structures. The film masterfully portrays the stark contrast between the opulent lives of the wealthy elite and the modest struggles of the middle class.Through witty dialogue and exaggerated situations, the movie exposes the condescending attitudes and superficiality often associated with the upper class. It highlights how their privilege can blind them to the realities of everyday life, leading to humorous yet thought-provoking interactions with characters from different socioeconomic backgrounds.While the film primarily focuses on entertainment, it also subtly underscores the importance of empathy and understanding. By showcasing the human side of both the rich and the middle class, the movie encourages viewers to challenge their own biases and preconceived notions.Overall, rango is a delightful cinematic experience that successfully blends humor and social commentary. It's a must-watch for anyone who appreciates clever writing, relatable characters, and a good laugh.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
I missed the wagon,"This movie was as dry as the desert it was filmed in. Based on the other reviews I obviously missed something here. I even fell asleep it was so slow and dry. Maybe because I don't like regular westerns is why I didn't like Rango. I probably have to watch it again because I just didn't get the whole story line with the turtle (without giving away anything for anyone). Beans accent was a bit over the top, I got tired of listening to her after awhile. Where credit may be do is that the movie made me feel as dry as its desert - it made me feel part of the film (tongue in cheek). Seriously, I suppose credit is do to the animation but a story is much more important to me to enjoy a movie. If the story is no good, like in this case, the animation doesn't even matter. Guess I'm just more of a Rio girl - color, fun",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
A visually stunning and endlessly rewatchable animated masterpiece,"Rarely does an animated film manage to feel both so stylized and so real at the same time, but Rango pulls it off effortlessly. The animation is breathtaking, capturing exaggerated movement and expressive characters while maintaining a level of detail that makes the world feel fully lived-in. This unique visual style, combined with the dusty, sunbaked look of the setting, does absolute justice to the Western genre, embracing its atmosphere rather than merely imitating it.Beyond its visuals, the film is elevated by stellar performances from its voice cast. Johnny Depp, along with the rest of the ensemble, brings genuine personality to every character, making the story feel rich and immersive. It's not just about the performances, though-the writing ensures that the plot unfolds naturally, and the character development adds real weight to the film's emotional moments. Every story beat feels earned, making the journey as engaging on repeat viewings as it was the first time.If there's any flaw to be found, it's difficult to pinpoint. Even after multiple rewatches, the film never loses its charm or energy. It remains engaging from start to finish, never feeling stale or predictable.For me, Rango stands as one of the greatest animated films ever made-an expertly crafted blend of visual brilliance, heartfelt storytelling, and a deep love for the Western genre that makes it endlessly rewatchable.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Definitely a kids film at heart and a good one at that.,"'RANGO': Four Stars (Out of Five)Industrial Light & Magic's first animated feature film and it's a beauty. I think it's the best looking animated film to date, the CGI animation is breathtaking! The film also marks the re-teaming of director Gore Verbinski and Johnny Depp (after making three 'PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN' films together). In the film Depp voices a chameleon who falls out of his owners' car and becomes lost in the Mojave Desert. He then finds a town of assorted animals living out in the Wild West in need of a sheriff. The film is written by John Logan, James Ward Byrkit and Verbinski. It's a pretty dark and somewhat mature animated film that some have argued is not a kids film. I think while it does have plenty of appeal for adults as well it's still a kids film at heart and a very good one at that.The film's title character is in fact a chameleon named Lars. Lars had always dreamed of adventure outside of the terrarium where he lives and when it falls off his owners' car on the highway he's forced into one. He first meets an armadillo named Roadkill (Alfred Molina) with mysterious healing abilities and tales of a 'Spirit of the West'. Roadkill encourages Lars to venture out into the desert so Lars does and is almost eaten by a hawk. He then finds the town of Dirt and lies to the locals telling them of adventurous duels he's been in. He also tells them his name is Rango. After he kills the deadly hawk with luck the town looks up to him and makes him their sheriff. He's then tasked with the responsibility of solving the town's water shortage, which is like gold to the animals living in the desert.The film, like I said, is very dark and filled with ugly looking characters, mature jokes and references as well as a fair amount of violence. It also has plenty of kids humor as well though and a heart and uplifting message too. A good kids film should appeal to adults as well and this one definitely does. It's got elements of western, comedy and a little spiritual drama (it's very psychedelic at times which is fitting for a Johnny Depp film). The movie doesn't talk down to kids and most of the jokes are not too cheesy or silly (although there are a few). It's a little slow in places but never for too long. The animation like I said is the best I've ever seen in a feature length animated film and the movie as a whole rivals the best of Pixar and DreamWorks. It's not the best animated film I've ever seen but it's definitely among them.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBqNUf10kuk",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
great,"a lot of cultural references. a lovely atmosphere. and one of the most bizarre heroes. this is all. a lot of adventures and high simplicity of a story about small events, a town and its savior. the clichés are used in fascinating manner. the humor is the basic pillar. the music, the love story, the enemies of the new Don Quijote - pieces of a perfect story about luck, courage and self discover in not comfortable middle of challenges. one of films who reminds books of childhood and seems be adorable political satire. but, first, a great animation. and this status is the argument who makes see again. and again. and its force of seduction, incredible freshness of the fight of brave Rango remain at the same high level of fascination.",,Anonymous,Animation
Another Masterpiece,"I just rewatched Rango, and man, this movie is something else. Unlike most animated animal movies that are made for kids and just want to sell toys, Rango is different. It is a full-on western with animals, and it came out when cowboy movies were making a comeback.When I was a kid, I didn't really like it, which makes sense because this movie isn't exactly for kids. It feels way too mature, and I remember thinking, is this even PG-13? The movie literally starts with a pangolin getting run over by a car, and they show it. That scene alone made me realize this film wasn't playing around. Later, there is a battle scene that straight-up feels like Mad Max, with explosions everywhere and characters getting wiped out left and right. It is brutal for an animated film.One cool detail is how Rango throws in easter eggs for classic western fans. The main character doesn't even have a real name at first, which is a nod to The Man with No Name from the legendary Clint Eastwood westerns. When he stumbles into the town of Dirt, he lies his way into becoming a hero and just randomly names himself Rango. It is funny at first, but later, it hits hard when he realizes pretending isn't enough-he has to be a real hero.This movie also made me thirsty. Everything is so dry and dusty that I felt like I needed water just watching it. The animation is insane. The details and the way the characters move make everything look so real. They even used motion capture for the actors, which is why the character animations feel so natural. Speaking of actors, they got a bunch of Pirates of the Caribbean cast members, including Johnny Depp as Rango, and the performances are amazing.What really makes Rango great is the message. It is all about being yourself. If you want to be a hero, don't just say you are, act like one. Rango spends most of the movie pretending, but in the end, he learns that real heroes do not fake it, they just do it.Overall, Rango is weird, wild, and way deeper than I expected. If you haven't seen it yet, go watch it. Just maybe keep a bottle of water nearby.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""I'm one of the few men with a maiden name.""","If the Coen Bros made an animated-existential-comedy-western-family film (which, let's be honest, is the only kind of family film they would make), it would certainly be very similar to this. Not to simply write off Verbinski; his eye for style and comedic timing are dry and wonderful. The design is easily some of the coolest and most unique in the CGI-animation era. And before Depp gave up acting for scarf collecting, he delivered even his vocal performances with great care.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
My Favorite Movie.,"This movie might just be the best cinematic animation that American pop culture has ever laid its eyes on. First off, They deserved the Oscar. Second off, this movie has stunning animation for its time, and the story line is amazing, taking all the great things from the golden age of western movies and replacing them with common desert animals! For a kids movie, it is surprisingly deep and has stuck with me for quite some time. There are almost too many plot twists for its own good, and the ending surprised me so much. This movie's plot is sort of similar to a 1960's Clint Eastwood movie, and I personally think that this is the best animated movie there is so far.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Inventive fun for kids and adults alike.,"It's a family favourite for us, and a rare breed for 21st century animation: a completely original idea that absolutely everyone will enjoy.Except the littlest ones, for whom the moments of danger and conflict will be too visceral, the tone of the film is perfectly calibrated. The screenplay is consistently funny, inventively structured, and perfectly paced through action scenes, character drama and a touch of romance. Johnny Depp and Isla Fischer have a ball voicing the dialogue, as do the deep cast of supporting characters.Lastly, the music is far better than the usual fare. It relies neither on licensed needle drops, nor on generic Hollywood scoring. The main theme is so instantly memorable that my first reaction was ""they've lifted it from an iconic western"". Nope, it's an original gem that sits alongside Enio Morricone's best work.What a film. Watch the extended version for additional silliness.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

I liked the western setting, Rango's lies and his socially awkward personality and his arc when he reached his lowest point. I like the towns folks and their designs. Animation was good.

Something you don't see every day.,"Rango was definitely an inventive movie when it came out. Not only that, but also something that's not very common in animation like a western themed movie. And much more convincing at that than let's say Home On The Range or Fievel Goes West.While I must admit that the plot had its predictability in some places. The beginning showcases exactly that when the domesticated lizard Rango ends up in unfamiliar surroundings and pretends to be a hot-shot. Even if the script offers many mature themes and interesting ideas, that choice of story made me guess a handful of outcomes.But that's the only criticism I have towards Rango, because everything else is astounding like the animation and the characters. Animation wise it even looks like something Pixar could have made or even better, and that's the biggest compliment one can get.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Well,this caught me off guard.Excellent movie!","Let's get this straight. Just to avoid confusion. While this had goofy looking characters and it is a CGI animation movie. This is not a kids movie. There is so much going on in Rango that definitely won't make sense to them.In essence Rango (obviously a Parody on Django) is a spaghetti western. Only now the lead is a chameleon voiced by Johnny Depp. Rango is filled with funny and slapstick moments.But it also has some real serious sequences. This is the surprising element that should not work and still it does. Trying to explain them will be difficult cause most of those scenes are very visual without dialog. Describing it won't do justice to them any way. People familiar with Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy will recognize Gore Verbinski's style.It simply is his best movie yet to date.Even better than the first POTC movie?. In my opinion yes.You can clearly see that a lot of work and love is put into it. For movie fans there are references throughout. One that really stands out is an epic scene involving a man with no name and a golf cart.Ultimate coolness. Don't make the mistake comparing this to CGI movies like Ice Age,Kungfu Panda or similar. Approach it like it is fully fledged western that has everything and more of that genre.If you get past that than you will have the pleasure to see one of the most funny and entertaining movies made this year.A must watch!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Rango: An Underrated Classic,"The film Rango directed by Gore Verbinski is based around a theatrical chameleon who gets abandoned from his lavish family into a town called Dirt. In an effort to show out for the citizens he proves his worth by displaying his skills with firearms and ends up impressing the town enough to become their sheriff. Little do they know his qualifications are completely made up and his identity is all an act. Throughout the film, Rango is exposed to a myriad of dangers that force him to change his sheriff duties from an act into becoming a true hero. This film uses the superb voice acting of Johnny Depp and Abigail Breslin along with many other popular actors to illustrate the underlying humor of the situation of a group of talking animals running a town. Which also brings up how dynamic and uncommon the plot is, the film shows another side to an otherwise uneventful story by giving the audience a peek into Rango's personal struggles with keeping up his lie, the film is also accompanied by an example of animation that is well above par.The Protagonist, Rango, is an inherently charming and funny character, he uses his expertise in theatre to coerce an entire town into believing he's a competent sheriff. This is made possible by the voice acting of Johnny Depp, an actor known for his humorous demeanor. Depp has been seen in films such as the Pirates of the Caribbean series and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, where he is yet again the comic relief. Rango, when brought into town, is very quickly introduced to a young, naive mouse named Pricilla, voiced by Abigail Breslin. Breslin in most all of her films represents an innocent little girl, such as in Little Miss Sunshine or Zombieland. Making her a perfect fit for the tiny mouse with a ""funny looking face""Many films nowadays have very predictable plots with little variation, Rango however, while having the common characteristics of the overplayed ""newcomer saving the day."" This film elaborates on that and makes the viewer fall in love with this strange little lizard, and makes you hope for his well-being even though the audience knows the whole time that his heroism is all a story. Also being that he is a lizard brings a completely new dynamic into the film, the animation. The animation is very impressive, the characters aren't creepy or disturbing like I commonly see in many animated films lately. The animation also impressed me by incorporating real world objects in an otherwise animated world, such as Rango's best friend, Mr. Timms, who is animated convincingly enough that he almost seems real.All in all, Rango is a very well rounded film. It incorporates good voice acting into a very fitting plot and is completed by superb animation. This film is one of nickelodeons best and makes me tear up every time I have to see Rango walk away from the town after they figure out his true identity. This film is very over looked in my opinion, and many people don't give it enough credit for how elaborate some of the animation is. Overall I can very confidently give this film 9 tumbleweeds out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Having just seen this recently, it's any kid's gateway drug to Western cinema.","Rango is a kid's film that knows the confines of family entertainment whilst trying to simultaneously break them as well: this movie has smoking, drinking and gunfights-galore, something that American animated movies tend to steer clear of. This one has all the archetypal characters you'd see in Sergio Leone's Spaghetti-Westerns and John Ford's Hollywood-Westerns, except they're computer-animated animals in a Nickelodeon production (the same guys who gave us Spongebob and Rugrats) and it's amazing that they'd let such taboo themes and imagery in a kids movie in the first place.How does this tale of a happy-go-lucky modern-world lizard against an Old-West backdrop convey the juxtapositions of modernism and that of the American frontier? It's surprising that Rango is that kind of movie: it's a comedy-adventure movie with hints of cinematically classical themes of good vs evil and told in ways that aren't boringly derivative of other movies prior to this one. Rango succeeds in being kid-friendly while trying to use that status to show how subversive the final product can be compared to other animated movies on the market.Rango is a rock-solid 4/5 stars for me.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

In fact half of the references are pointed towards things adults would only know (according to my mum) and the plot is actually surprising in some ways. As a western fan, and Clint Eastwood fan, the movie provides great nostalgia to the man with no name. For me this is one of the best animated films I have ever seen.

An OK movie with a somewhat stretched plot.,"There was a good cinematography, but the plot was predictable and stretched. Some actions in the middle were unconnected to the story.

The start was interesting, which made me interested, so I followed the plot. But at some point, when Rango become Sheriff, things started to be uninteresting. From that point to the point of meeting the snake and leaving the town was very general plot with no real interesting events. Then meeting the Man with No Name was interesting again. The face off with the snake in the end promised to be a good concluding act. But again, it was stretched into something else, and I lost the interest again.

Bad!,"This film is about a lonely pet lizard who ventures into a desert town, becoming a popular hero.I cannot believe how bad ""Rango"" is. The first few minutes is already a train wreck. The scenes of Rango in the tank are stupid and annoying. The background looks so plastic and fake, which are signs of a bad film. As the film progresses, it does not get any better.

And the owl band is so annoying, they keep truncating scenes that otherwise would have moved smoothly.

Brilliant Animated Film Draws References from Classics,"Most animated films are made for families and children but here we see a rare film that almost falls into the art film category. Rango is a perverse, philosophical tribute to movie- making which can be difficult to comprehend. The references to other films requires viewing this gem several times but the humor can be a bit too sophisticated or vulgar for some. It's an existential film about chameleon finding who he is, if he is the hero and whether he has an identity in the old west, much like the Man With No Name, a tribute to Sergio Leone's films.The film is rich with references to other films. For example, some people point out the Ride of the Valkyries in the canyon with the bats as a tribute to Apocalypse Now or Ned Beatty's mayor is a tribute to Chinatown and the little girl who always asks questions is remotely similar to a character in True Grit. The tower in the town is a bit like The Quick and The Dead (which had the woman with no name seeking revenge as in Once Upon a Time in the West). The reference to water and control is clearly from Dune, another movie where water was a central theme (He who controls the water or ""spice""...)...and the walking cactus in the desert are reminiscent of the worms as well as water everywhere in the end...We get hints of the philosophy of the film when in the beginning, we realize our protagonist is a lonely, nerdy chameleon who first runs into the question of why did the armadillo cross the road. The Spirt of the West lies on the other side (and we later see he's incredibly close to a screen legend without a name). The alabaster carriage and golden guardians turns out to be hilariously something familiar to us (hint: Oscar and Clint). The dream images are like Native American soul-searching with the Great Spirit. And the image of the earth bugs carrying away Rango to the distant future might be a reference to visions of death, perhaps a bit as in Gladiator.Industrial Light & Magic did a brilliant job of animation with the details of shadows in the town and the desert panorama. The rich close-ups of the animal characters is a bit disconcerting. I love the rabbit with one ear or Spoons, the white rat with the strong cowboy accent. The close-ups of the ugly characters is a tribute to Sergio Leone who loved to zoom in on eyes and facial skin cracks.Perhaps the most film references, however, as to Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West. We see Rango's mayor is a cripple like OUTITW's Morton who competes with Jake the Snake (Henry Fonda). The black hat might be Lee van Cleef but easily Fonda's Frank. The scene in the bar where Rango finds his name is clearly a reference to OUTITW when Claudia Cardinale (Jill McBain) meets Charles Bronson (Harmonica) and Jason Robards (Cheyenne). Lionel Stander's bartender was copied by the toady barman. The mayor makes references to the future, buying the ranch (owned by Beans who even has red hair like Jill McBain) and that Jake isn't a businessman but the last gunslinger is a reference to Once Upon a Time in the West....the characters and lines are quite similar. The drink sliding across the bar in the shadows was a reference to Cheyenne sliding the gun across to Harmonica. There's an interview by the visual effects director who actually mentions the numerous references and modeling after Once Upon a Time in the West. That movie, consider by many the greatest western ever made, was a tribute to many westerns that came before and also copied the classic westerns.This film is clearly for the film buff, but not necessarily for everyone. It's a rich comedy that has the depth of The Seventh Seal, Citizen Kane or 8 1/2.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A Wonderful Western with Mature Themes, Brilliant Music, Colourful Characters and Great Animation","What do you get if you cross Johnny Depp,with a lizard and a trippy journey with Western homages in a huge leap for the animation industry? Well, you would get the strangest punchline ever. That is basically Rango. A series of incredible shots and angles by Direvtor Gore Verbinski, as well as tributes to the greats such as Chinatown, The Good the Bad and the Ugly, The Hills Have Eyes, Apocalypse Now and even the strange and bizarre Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas with the added cameo of Raoul Puke. The film follows a pet chameleon who falls out of the back of a car in a road accident and runs into an armadillo who directs hi, to the town of Dirt, a small settlement in the middle of the Mojave desert in Nevada. There he meets a host of other creatures like the fiery tongued, intelligent female iguana, Beans, an adorable cactus mouse Priscilla who is obsessed with death and many others all of whom are tough, adapted and not so trusting of strangers- until he spins a lie that he is a hero of the West named Rango, through his love of character acting and thespians. However, becoming the town's new sheriff isn't as fun and rewarding as most would think. The regular thugs such as Bad Bill the gila monster and his furry gang, and a clan of water thieves as well as the dangerous outlaw Rattlesnake Jake threatening to come to town, Rango has his work cut out for him. On top of solving the town's drought problem, finding a way for Beans to keep her ranch and convincing his new friends he's as tough as he talks he must also go on a journey of self discovery and break his existential crisis and live up to his new identity.Rango is a fantastic film for many reasons. The animation to begin with is just Gorgeous. Beautifully done with it's realistic detail in fur, scales, facial expressions and setting. The actors for the film actually came in to the studio for 20 days to act out some of the scenes with costumes and props so the animators could use it as a reference-but this is far from the awkward and slightly disturbing method of motion capture that we've seen in films such as Polar Express and Mars Needs Moms. It's the movement and facial expressions that make the characters look so live action and yet so cartoony. The main character himself is not a good role model, but he isn't a bad one either. He lies, makes bad choices but it's usually not his intent. He is just trying to find out who he is. The love interest Beans is a sharp and clever lead with a soft side. A rancher who is prone to a ""defence mechanism"" of catatonia which is common in many lizards. She and Rango share the usual banter especially as she views him as very untrustworthy and a bit of a wuss at first before warming up to him after some days together with a posse on the hunt for water bandits. The side characters are memorable and funny. Anthropomorphic animals such as toads, chickens, frogs, lizards, rabbits, squirrels, owls, mice moles and rats who all have their moments. The main villain is the turtle Mayor John who wants to control the water for his own intentions. The real treat is the incredibly amazing gun-slinger Rattlesnake Jake, who's appearance is based off of Lee Van Cleef's Angel Eyes. From his slithering movements, hellfire eyes, Gatling gun rattle and an awesome black hat, Jake's reveal is brilliantly done, with the added poison honey of Bill Nighy using a similar technique from his Davy Jones role in Pirates of the Caribbean. The shots in this movie are beautiful. From the setting sunsets to the time lapse of dusk to night to the close ups of opening and closing cactus flowers and our character walking solemnly against a bright silver full moon. The themes Rango takes on are heavy and sometimes overly adult. I would NOT recommend this as a movie for young children. I would say 12 and up is a suitable age, as it leans more towards a teen and adult audience. It's a PG but honestly I would rate it 12a or PG-13. There are LOTS of violent scenes with guns, threats and attacks as well as a knife being pulled at one point. Although no blood is shown you keep expecting them to take that road. There is also swearing, minor like ""damn,"" ""hell"" ""shit"" ""son of a bitch,"" but it's not too frequent. There are also some sexual references and anatomical words used as well as a sign reading ""Soiled Dove"" an obvious yet subtle reference to the brothels of the Old West. There are scenes of drinking and smoking as well as spitting but, hey. It's the old west and it wouldn't be a western without those things. I congratulate every single person who worked on Rango, and I eagerly await a sequel if one is in the works.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Good movie that's different, some flaws.","I saw this movie about a month and a half ago and it was definitely interesting.I had heard reviews that were mostly positive about the film and was worth watching.Rango starts out rather amusingly. We have a chameleon who thinks he's an actor and lives in his tiny glass cage. While rehearsing with his half bodied actress and his wind up fish (Forgot the names of his cast) he's thrust out of the back of a car window while his owners avoid a car wreck.Rango is now in no-man's land and must escape from a Hawk who wants him FOR A MEAL! Tons of action awaits the viewer.Rango is a great film and it touches on things that most people who don't think for themselves it would go right over their heads. This film touches on things such as progression, theology, and even suicide. And also if you watch this movie close enough you'll figure out that the armadillo is representing God.The only drawbacks to this film is it has a lot of swearing such as Hell and Damn and not appropriate for very young children. Also Rango went on a little to long but was still worthwhile.I am looking forward the DVD release.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
It is entirely predictable!,"Looks like I have finally found a winner for the Oscars of that year that the awards should reconsider picking. Rango can be summarized in a line used by one of its characters 'its entirely predictable'...and it really is.Looking at modern animation nowadays, i am sorry to say, this cartoon has more clichéd elements and more uninteresting characters that are lacking both in terms of depth and intelligence (seriously, is this how they want to fool the kids? Even though it is just a cartoon?). Also, even with a cowboy theme, it appears quite dead as compared to other real cowboy-theme non-cartoon movies. The score could have been much higher if the film is smart enough to introduce the back stories of the main characters -- who is Rango? Who is the female lead? or the villain? or the Mayor? I have no idea at all.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pointless exercise.No substance.,"I give this movie 3 out of 10.The characters and animation are really high end,everything else is not.This is not an animated film for kids,the dialogues and humour are not suitable for children,and,lets face it,the characters are simply too rancid and disgusting looking to have your kids exposed to them.And yet,the movie's story is so shallow that I don't see it suitable for adults either.In other words,it's just your regular empty-headed animated feature,and the audience is expected to be in awe just because there are digital characters rendered on screen and acting out real actor's voice over.I'd say that Toy Story 1 conveyed more emotions and story than Rango,despite it being released ages ago and despite it being more technically ground-braking in terms of digital animation for its time.Digital features have been around long enough for me not to be impressed by the 3D visuals only,I thought ILM would know better than that.",,Anonymous,Animation
Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: Rango,"Rango [2011] PG - 107mins - Animation/Adventure/Comedy - 4th March 2011With western films seemingly on the comeback in recent years, it was only a matter of time before an animated version of the wild wild west made it to our screens and it has done so in the guise of Rango.Rango (Johnny Depp) is a somewhat unique chameleon who finds himself, as with many animated films these days, catapulted from within his safe surroundings accompanied by his ever trusty sidekick Mr. Timms (a plastic goldfish) into the barren and unforgiving wild where his adventure truly begins. Depp as usual brings his own unique style to the character of Rango which doesn't disappoint.Rango meets up with many other quirky animals which really gives the movie character and I have to say that the visuals in this are stunning, some of the best out there and it really is starting to get to that point that you forget it is an animation with the scenery and hot dry climate being portrayed looking top notch. Add the gritty looking critters who really look like they have been worn down by the desert and it's a hats off to the animators who have outdone their Pixar rivals (it's a Nickelodeon production for those wondering) on this front.The movies humour is great and combines lots of slapstick, good one liners and excellent facial expressions that really got me going but this I felt is traded off, only slightly, as the movie goes on so that the plot can continue to develop. As usual with these films there is some subtle and some not so subtle references for the older generations that are likely to swoop over a few younger heads. In fact more so than usual I would say with the humour more based for adults than children.Throughout the movie four singing mariachi owls accompany Rango narrating his tale a la the three mice from Babe, well not quite but you get the gist, maybe more the rooster from Robin Hood and provide another perspective that does well to break the movie up and add to the comedy of it all. Speaking of the owls, the music also draws you in and any movie that can play Ride of the Valkyries on a banjo and still make it sound good wins my vote!All in all Rango has managed to combine great jokes, funny characters and stunning visuals within a solid story. The combination of Depp and Verbinski (Pirates of the Caribbean 1,2,3) has worked once again and it seems to have broken the mould in so far as it's a children's animation and yet I can see the adults coming away with the bigger smiles.For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Masterfully animated feature that is sure to delight both young and old.,"Rango is one of the best animated features I have ever seen. Johnny Depp is stellar as the naive and eccentric chameleon that is lost in the desert and trying to find himself. The animation is second to none, at times it seems completely real, an amazing feat considering the characters are all anthropomorphic animals. The characters, the voice acting, the story; everything falls together perfectly to create a wonderful film.Rango (Johnny Depp) is starving artist chameleon, always performing for an audience of one (himself) in his safe, yet boring, fish tank. He has no real idea who he is or what his purpose in life should be. His life is turned upside down when an accident leaves him stranded in the middle of the desert where he meets a cast of crazy spaghetti western characters in the frontier town of Dirt. Dirt is a rough and tumble town that is facing a drought and a series of quirky misadventures leads to Rango becoming the new sheriff. Of course there are outlaws to be captured, corrupt officials to be stopped, and a woman to win, all staples of the romantic American western.The creative energies that were obviously poured into the film really pay off, Rango is funny, polished, and vastly entertaining. There is enough silliness to keep children interested, yet there is always a serious overtone that keeps adults engaged and the plot moving along. Don't let the fact that Nickelodeon was involved, this isn't your average kid's movie, it's much, much more.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Definitely worth seeing,"This animation is a great way to introduce children to the classic western theme. The characters are interesting and the plot is strong. The viewer gets a sense of how dry and desolate the west can be along with the harsh struggle for existence. Depp was a perfect choice for the main character, but the Clint Eastwood character could have looked a little more authentic. The film also lacks the kind of polish that could have made it a truly great Western. The moral theme is clear and solid, but the film lacks sufficient poignancy to become a classic. Still, it is a great family movie.I plan to purchase the DVD and put it with my Westerns collection. I look forward to watching it many times with the grandchildren.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Funny but silly,"It was fun to watch Rango even though sometimes throughout the movie i was tempted to interrupt it. The mix of silly or intelligent hybrid jokes, weird characters and animal relationships in a harsh desert environment made me stay. Rango had a pretty boring but good life; he didn't know it until tragedy struck upon him and he ended up in a survival situation that forced him to adapt very quickly. Intelligent and willing to survive no matter what, he becomes the hero and subsequently the sheriff of a desperate city. I chose to see the extended version and i can't imagine a shorter one. The special features are very interesting introducing the viewers in the real world of each character, sort of National Geographic or Steve Irwin style. Relax while listening to John Depp's voice as Rango!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pixar still reigns over Nickelodeon,"¨So you want something to believe in? Believe in that there sign. For as long as it hangs there we've got hope. ¨2010 was a great year for animated films (I guess that's the correct term for them now since no one calls them cartoons anymore) with Toy Story 3, How to Train Your Dragon, and Tangled all ranking among my Top 25 Films of last year. Rango is the first film I've seen from 2011 since I had a lot of catching up to do with last year's movies before the Award Season ended; and one thing is for sure: Rango won't rank among my favorite films for this year. Rango is director Gore Verbinski's (known for The Ring and the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy) first animated film and he's receiving a lot of positive reviews so far in his incursion to the animated field. I wasn't as excited as most critics were however since I was a little disappointed with the story. There is no denying that the visuals were stunning and the CGI animation was breathtaking, but the story really didn't work for me. I didn't think the characters had any depth to them and the story really dragged at several points of the film for no apparent reason rather than to evoke the mood of most Westerns. Rango is a parody of Spaghetti Westerns (fans of the genre will find plenty of spoofs from several movies including The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly) and the title of the film is actually inspired on another Western, Django. The visuals truly capture the beautiful scenery we see in most westerns, but the story just seemed to be all over the place and I failed to connect with it. There were also very few funny moments as I didn't find many of the spoofs that amusing, and I don't see how kids would find them funny at all.As for the plot goes we are introduced to Rango (voiced by the great Johnny Depp), a green chameleon wearing a red Hawaiian tee-shirt. He seems to spend most of his time in his cage imagining himself saving a damsel from distress (actually a head-less Barbie doll) from an evil villain (a Nemo-like toy fish). While he is in the midst of this imaginary feat, the vehicle where his cage is at the present time swirls making it fly out of the car and break, so Rango finds himself free in the middle of the desert. He encounters an armadillo (Alfred Molina), who guides him to the town of Dirt, a town in desperate need for a hero since there is a shortage of water. Rango encounters Beans (Isla Fisher) who warns him about the situation in the town of Dirt and the little hospitality the townsfolk have with foreigners, but Rango has no problem making friends by lying and telling stories about his ¨heroic acts.¨ His odds are improved when he accidentally kills a hawk, which happened to terrorize everyone in the village. Rango becomes the local hero and the Mayor (Ned Beatty) appoints him as the new Sheriff of Dirt. It's the opportunity he has been dreaming of: becoming a hero, but there is a lot more to this town than meets the eye. The Mayor seems to be hiding some crucial information about the water supply, and with the hawk out of the picture the locals now fear that Rattlesnake Jake (Bill Nighy) will return to terrorize them.I tried to simplify the plot as much as I could as there are actually a lot of things going on that aren't developed really well. The plot does draw heavily from Chinatown (screenwriter John Logan actually claimed he was inspired in that film when he wrote the story) and it spoofs many Westerns (Bill Nighy said he was inspired in the bad character from The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly and we see Rango wearing a poncho like the man with no name did in that same film). John Logan has done some interesting work in the past (Sweeny Todd, Aviator, and Gladiator), but I really didn't enjoy this story that much. Rango simply didn't live up to the great animated films from last year, and the visuals were just not enough to save this film since that has become a known asset in every animated movie. I do think that the CGI was a bit above average from other animated movies, but it wasn't enough to save the poor story. I really had high expectations for this film since I enjoy Westerns and thought it was about time for a good animated Western to come out. I just didn't think this movie had any heart, like say Toy Story 3 or Tangled had. I just didn't get emotionally attached with Rango and didn't find it very funny at all. I wouldn't recommend this.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Rango, For the Love of Water.","What would I expect from a movie called Rango with a lizard on it's cover if a haven't even read the synopsis before watching it? Yeah, it took me by surprise.Latelly we have a new Depp's movie like almost every month, and since he does the same job all of them, he's getting to repetitive for my taste. But Rango couldn't be done by another actor. This time, Depp has overcome my expectations, and he was brilliant. Another actors did an amazing and remarkable job, but the attention I've gave to Depp was because I wasn't expecting to much from him.Rango is fulfilled with an amazing soundtrack that is capable of stealing viewers attention every time it shows off. Characters design was also pretty well made and they also kinda remind me some actors I've seen before, like Kate Micucci (Raising Hope) and Beans.References to Fear And Loathin in LA was a plus, too bad I couldn't see another one like another viewers, but Rango has it's bonus.Visual art and character design deserve some attention too, and the atmosphere is also stunning.Plot ain't the best I've seen from an animation movie, there's lotta things that could be improved or changed (like every good movie has, since we humans has the ""power of creativity"") and because of my constant pursuit of originality as an spectator, I did expected little bit of changes in the plot since I started to understand whats going on. Because of this predictability, I can't give Rango a an 9.But what about the message? Rango has a brilliant and expressive one: ""Who controls the water, controls everything.This is an Inconvenient truth, what's Rango is all about. Almost like a science fiction predicting future. We'll be re-watching Rango in 50 years from now in children's in primary schools to teach kids to better take care of the world and all that attitudes we'll be embittering off someday.Another problem in Rango was some moments characters could remain quiet but they wasted on old jokes. This is something we don't do nowadays if we wanna make an original film.Except two little things that could be done, Rango is amazingly well directed/produced/designed and performed movie.

Wasn't Expecting It To Be This Good,"Continuing my plan to watch every Johnny Depp movie in order, I come to Rango.I had totally forgot about this movie. I'm not sure if i enjoyed it first time around, as i couldn't remember anything about it. Rango is wonderfully made, has good characters and is great fun. And not just for kids. It probably works better the more movies you have seen. It has a strong story (OK, it's mostly your typical western story) funny jokes and movie references (from Star Wars to Apocolypse Now) and a first-rate voice cast!! Bill Nighy, Ned Beatty, Alfred Molina and Ray Winston join Depp as the most recognisable voices.Now and again, you can always find a gem in supposed kids movies, and this is one such gem.Rango grossed $123 million at the domestic box office to end 2011 as the 22nd highest grossing movie of the year!!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Excellent,"I had some reserves about this movie, despite all the awards, maybe just because it is an animated picture with reptiles.This being said, I decided to watch it and I don't regret it. The 3D animation is excellent in a story adapted from the old western movies a modern spin.The water is the money, and also the source of life, in a close allegory for modern days in a very intelligent way.In the midst of it all, an outsider comes to save the day, and every one (maybe except the underground critters .he! he!). In order to do so he will have to discover his inner strength as well as the truth in his motivation.It uses as reference the old Clint Eastwood westerns and Star Wars saga, among several others, and voice stars like Johnny Depp, Isla Fisher and Ned Beaty, and the outcome is very effective on drawing in the kids as well as the grown-ups, in an exercise in animation excellence.Personally I especially liker the four howls as great and funny storytellers.Excellent.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Annoying.....,"I've gotta admit up front that I am not a huge Johnny Depp fan and frankly think I've seen enough of him for some time. Now I am not saying he isn't talented—he certainly is. But so often his films have 'mega-hit' written all over them and the public throngs to his films like lemmings—and I just think I've seen enough. Plus, he's in practically EVERYTHING these days and I just wish he'd take a break. This is especially true in ""Rango"" as if you love Depp, great...but if you don't, you'll probably REALLY hate the film. That's because Depp's character talks practically non-stop--and is about as subtle as Ebola. And, frankly, so many of the characters and the music to this film is just LOUD, LOUD and LOUD!!! I just kept wishing the film hadn't tried so hard. In my daughter's words, ""there doesn't seem to be any plot...just Johnny Depp screaming a lot"". Ditto.This is all a big shame, as apart from being a loud and obnoxious film, the CGI is AMAZING--and among the best I've seen so far. It's a quality production but annoying--and the rottenness of the Best Animated Film category was terrible for 2012 if this film ended up winning! In my opinion, they should have just not given an award instead of rewarding such a film.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Really engaging movie (and yes, even for the 7 year old)!!","So, I've seen a lot out there about parents getting' their bloomers in a bunch about this movie not being ""kid-friendly.""I have one response to that: bull.Sure, the word ""he!!"" is tossed around a few times, and a few others, but why in the world is that a problem for your kid? Ask my seven year old when he can start cursing, and he'll tell you ""When I'm 18."" Ask him when he can start drinking, and he'll say ""When I'm 21."" Will he do both earlier? Probably, but seeing ""Rango"" is not the cause. I also saw a parent's review that said the movie was all about 'death,' and therefore also not appropriate for kids. Death is the only certainty in the world, and I don't understand how talk of death isn't appropriate for kids. Best expose them now to it (on an acceptable level) so that they're not totally spun out when it touches their young lives.Back to the movie--it was a wonderful amalgam of so many Westerns that I've seen, but it doesn't end there. Hunter S. Thompson, for example, makes a brief appearance in the first 10 minutes of the movie! There are glorious pop culture references and jokes throughout the entire movie, which kept my 40-year old a$$ very amused and engaged.The seven year old didn't get those references--but he truly loved the story line, and the visuals were stunning to him. He was saying lines from it the rest of the day, and we both got a chuckle out of some of the scenes.

A beautifully ugly tale,"Rango is the first fully computer animated film from the special effects production company, Industrial Light and Magic. They enter an arena occupied by two well known heavy weights, Pixar and Dreamworks. Fair to say, ILM definitely have a hit on their hands. Director, Gore Verbinksi has made some very successful films (Mousehunt, The Ring, all the Pirates Of The Caribbean films) and this is his first foray into animation. Rango is a pretty different type of kids film. Firstly, a lot of the images and violence would probably scare the daylights out of kids under ten, and a lot of the film references and themes would go unnoticed by the young. A lot of work has gone into creating characters that look incredibly real. Each mole and hair is carefully detailed and gives the film a unique texture. The overall design is beautifully ugly. It creates an amazingly detailed desert world where everything is incredibly dry and dirty, and it captures it all in a stylish and creative way. On top of having some of the greatest animation around it also boasts a great voice cast. Johnny Depp's charm and quirkiness comes through in voicing Rango and Isla Fisher throws her Aussie accent away for an American Cowgirl voice to create her character, (Rango's love interest) Bean. Alfred Molina, Abigail Breslin, Bill Nighy and Timothy Olyphant also add their voice talents. Those that are familiar with/like westerns will be overloaded with the amount of film references. On occasion, it even comes across as slightly smug and annoying with the amount of 'look-how-smart-we-are' moments there are. Also, the story is not really original and it doesn't really carry the emotional weight that Pixar films do. Still, this fun and smart animated western has a hell of a lot going for it.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
An universal design of screenwriting and filmmaking,"I have watched this film multiple times and each time I watched I had a different experience and view of this film. At the base level of this film is what you see which is presumably for the young audience but when I watched later on the years I came to see that the film's scenes were shot as though it was for the older audience as well, it contained metaphorical references that had deep moral values imbued in these once thought shallow dialogues. It's imaginative contextual language brings alive the story to us in our own world.The music and the cinematography was the main factors of its enticing nature but the highlight was what it taught the audience of a good message of creating character and integrity which is what serves a good children's movie. The film reflects the reality of greed and selfishness what children should know about.Overall, the scriptwriter has created this universality for adults and children to enjoy, to understand and to apply.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great movie with animation and art that borders on realism,"Rango is a good movie with a cliche but enjoyable story. My favorite part about it is the animation and art and how they are bordering on realism. In the scenes that only feature only thr backgrounds, it'd be tough to differentiate between what is a photo and what is CGI. I also liked the movies central theme about people needing to finish their stories. Even if you feel like you're not ready or not meant to be, you'll never feel completely ready to tackle life's challenges. You'll just have to go at them.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A peyote dream masquerading as a kid's movie,"For the first five minutes, I was worried that Rango was going to be some innocuous kids movie about a lonely lizard. And then, in a crazy moment of shattered glass and slow motion spilling water, Rango revealed itself as a movie of stunning animation and a willingness to get kinda weird.Ten minutes later, it showed itself as a movie that was willing to get really, really weird.While the whole animated cartoon characters would seem to make this a kid's movie, such things as evil looking trees and a quick shot of Hunter S. Thompson tell a different tale. The movie is bizarre and trippy.It is also fast-paced, stylish and at times quite funny, although it's not the funniest of animated features and is really more memorable for some of the best animation I've ever seen in a Hollywood movie and a huge cast of bizarre and creepy characters.Is this a kid's movie? Well, it's dark and twisted and very strange, but then, so is Alice in Wonderland. While adults often forget this, kids are dark, twisted individuals. But since I don't have any, I won't say whether it's a good movie to take kids to. But it's a great movie to take yourself to.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very cool movie,"The voice talent, however, is superb in every aspect. Johnny Depp showcases his range and delivers a performance that's just nerdy and vulnerable enough to speak to everyone watching, while having strong enough character to keep audiences rooting for him. The rest of the cast is brimming with celebrity voices and everyone turns in wonderful performances aided with pitch-perfect animation. Isla Fisher and Bill Nighy (as Rattlesnake Jake) transform their voices so much that they're barely recognizable. Other notable voices are Alfred Molina, Abigail Breslin and Timothy Olyphant. Everyone pulls more than their weight and truly makes the most of their respective scenes.The target audience will no doubt love Rango, but the film doesn't quite tap into a universal emotion that bridges all age groups. While the film does give older audiences a few treats, like adult jokes, a Clint Eastwood reference and a political message that marries currency with mindless religion, this film is mainly for the kids and they will simply have a good time.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

Chameleon: Action Masking Symbolism,"""Rango"" is a throwback to the 1950s western genre with a twist. The John Wayne of the film is a chameleon. This unlikely hero creates a modern, adult, animated, western flick of fun and depth with the help of director Gore Verbinski (""Pirates of the Caribbean 1-3"") and Johnny Depp (most recently ""The Tourist""). Depp and Verbinski have teamed up before in the first three ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films and are back with their best flick since ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"". Depp voices Rango, a lost chameleon who is lost in the middle of the wild west after being thrown out of his secluded life as a pet lizard from the back of a moving car. Rango finds himself in the town of Dirt that is looking for a hero. The town is synonymous with any beaten down town in classic western cinema. The town is desperate for a source of water and protect from Rattlesnake Jake (Bill Nighy, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part I""). The Mayor (Ned Beatty, ""Toy Story 3"") is doing everything he can, but even he cannot stop the over powerful force of urbanization as the classic cow town fades away. Rango joins locals Beans (Isla Fisher, ""Confessions of a Shopoholc"") and Prisicilla (Abigail Breslin, ""Little Miss Sunshine"") and others to find the secrets behind the water shortage in the town while unmasking the spiritual truth behind the film rebirthing the magic of the Wild West.""Rango"" is not just another animated film concerning a childish plot and overused 3D animation. While 3D has literally taken animated films to another dimension Verbinski decides to bypass it and stick with a more rugged 2D look. ""Rango"" targets adults and features many metaphorical and symbolic moments alongside brilliant action sequences. The film contains one of the best animated action sequences ever created along with one of the greatest almost cameos. Rattle Snake Jake is also one of the greatest animated villains ever created. Depp's character Rango is also very well characterized fitting into the cowboy hero stereotype with a little modern flare. His monologue at the beginning of the kicks off his character's development along with exemplifying the dark undertones of the well written script accompanied by some singing birds. ""Rango"" inserts modern concerns and ideologies into the west reaching a wide range of viewers.This is a film that the audience has to seek out and give a chance and in order to get anything out of it. It is a hard film to read and is meant to be invested in, instead of grasping the viewer. Therefore, this is not necessarily the best film for kids to watch and should be looked at as a more mature film because of its symbolic subject matter. Also, there is some empty space on the open range in slow sequences leading the slightly film off track. Also, the cameo is fake and even though it is meant as a joke, come on! ""Rango"" is ""Shane"" meets ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" released in an era dominated by animated films reliant on the beauty of color and special effects. Not to say that recent animated movies are bad, ""Rango"" is just original and different. It is early to make too many predictions, but ""Rango"" may be showing up again next February",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Western tropes reposited as CGI animal comedy,"RANGO is one of those interminable all-star-voice-cast animations that Hollywood churn out for the kids. These films always have lame, action-focused plots that feel repetitive in the extreme, and are chock-full of in-jokes and references for their parents taking the kids along. This one is an extremely clichéd western adventure in which a mild-mannered chameleon becomes sheriff of a western town and has to clear up trouble. Johnny Depp slums it as the lead while the various voice actors play the parts of various stereotypes. The best thing about it is the use of classical themes on the soundtrack, but I didn't care for the cold CGI work and the action is interminable. The Man With No Name's cameo is the best thing about this.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Who is the target audience for this?,"The art style of it is so dry and boring. Environments mostly consist of dull colouring. Almost all of the characters are revoltingly ugly. The whole film is just disgusting to look at in the visual sense. It uses very realistic animation to such a degree that it is closer to real life than a standard animated film, and the characters are so hideous. It arouses revulsion while watching it, I can't imagine kids loving it for how this film looks visually. Certainly, I was not too fond of it as a kid. And I get it, in many Westerns, characters are filthy and disgusting and this film is like a parody of your average Western, but it comes to my 2nd point.Who is this film made for? The kids certainly will not recognise most if not any of the references to the classic Western films. And except for one scene, this film is too lacklustre for adults watching this for references and nostalgia alone. When it comes to jokes this film is too inappropriate for kids, the adult jokes are not even subtle in the slightest and I can see plenty of kids being disgusted or scared by the film. But simultaneously the film is way too silly and primitive for adults.The protagonist is not only unlikeable but severely creepy as well.But despite all the underwhelming aspects of the film, I can praise its beginning, the first 20 minutes or so are quite original and interesting. And I like that ""Western spirit"" encounter, even though it's a shame that it was not Clint Eastwood who voiced the character. And I can definitely praise the action scenes, due to the super realistic animation and art style they look quite real and awesome. So overall the film is a mixed bag.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Worst Best Animated Feature Winner,"That is, unless FROZEN wins it at the 86th Academy Awards.I like Westerns and I like animated movies so I was really looking forward to seeing RANGO. It was pretty disappointing.The first thing I have to talk about is the animation. Now, I liked the backgrounds and all but the characters (except for Rango and the owls) are just not pleasant to look at. Now I get why they did it. They wanted to make it look gritty like quite a few live-action Westerns. But why would they make them *that* grotesque? (I wish I could italicize here). They don't need to look pretty. They can look unkempt without being grotesque. I'm sorry but that was a big problem for me.The story was kind of simplistic and clichéd too. It's been done quite a few times already. There's a guy who's new to a town. He defeats a villain and is called a hero. Then a more dangerous villain challenges him and he reveals to everyone that he isn't really much of a hero. Then...I won't spoil it but you know how it ends.I think they were trying to parody Westerns rather than making a serious Western. I know it was mainly a comedy. But they could still been more original.None of the jokes were that funny either. I have absolutely no problem with the fact that RANGO seemed to be made for older audiences. A lot of people complained that it wasn't for kids and all that. I didn't care. I really liked Ralph Bakshi's FRITZ THE CAT which was meant for older audiences than RANGO. I was hoping for a kind of adult animated movie, which would have been nice for a change. But all we get are references to prostate inspections and mammograms. There was no cleverness or anything.There are quite a few references to films in the Western genre. There's even a Clint Eastwood parody. Once again, there wasn't much cleverness in these references.I hope Industrial Light & Magic tries again, though. I do want to see some quality animated movies outside of Disney, DreamWorks, and Pixar.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

It featured foul language and inappropriate jokes. There was also some things that kids might find disturbing, such as scary looking creatures, creatures getting killed, and terms like ""I'll squeeze those brown eyes out of your skull"" and ""...your guts leak lead"" or something like that. In fact, it slightly disturbed me. I thought it would be good, considering that it looked cute and Rango was voiced by Johnny Depp. I'm disappointed. Not only that, but the storyline seems to falter.

"Hilarious, Distinctive, Western Story About a Lizard's Solitude","""Rango"" is a distinctive western animated feature that tells the story of a lonely lizard about his journey to finding meaning in his life. I like how the story is filled with hilarious moments and jokes, and I can guarantee you will not be disappointed in the intense action. Our title character has no name; Rango is a name that he makes up. The entire film allows us to witness the adventure of Rango from a nobody to a hero and how he learns about the true purpose of his life and dream.Rango is a unique and highly personified work that prevails at combining the elements of animation, comedy and western taste. It should be the kind of movie that caters for a wide array of audience. This is easily one of the best pieces of animation of the year.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

Meta-Western...,"""Rango"" is a fascinating oddity: a meta-Western, heavily larded with irony, sarcasm, cliché, and adult sensibilities, couched in an animated film format that uses the time-honored (some might venture to say ""time-worn"") plot structure of a movie for children. There's little doubt that the movie possesses technical brilliance; the animation is dazzling and dazzlingly executed, as one would expect from this first, animated feature out of Industrial Light and Magic. Director Gore Verbinski keeps the film zipping along at breakneck speed and the longueurs are infrequent. BUT... for all its not inconsiderable entertainment value, ""Rango"" doesn't quite succeed as a movie. The problem lies primarily in its unsettling disjunction between message and medium. ""Rango"" sounds like a children's movie, looks like a children's movie, but isn't a children's movie. It attempts to encapsulate the naiveté and wonder that are the distinctive hallmarks of childhood, but constantly undercuts those qualities by its heavy use of ironic, self-reflecting commentary. Adults viewing it will enjoy toting up the movie's clever samplings of ""oater"" cliché from time immemorial. Their enjoyment of it will be magnified by their knowledge of ""High Noon"" and other western flicks. Children, who -- for the most part -- lack that cinematic context, won't get it. And, since the movie derives much of its generative power from that context, children seeing ""Rango"" will have to fall back on the action chase sequences and the toilet humor for enjoyment. I suppose, given the impoverished level of much of what passes for ""children's entertainment"" these days, that may be enough for some kids. But I suspect the makers of ""Rango"" were after something better and I wish their ""grasp"" had lived up to their ""reach."" It's a shame, but I'd guess that many adult movie-goers (who would enjoy the flick, if they saw it) will bypass ""Rango,"" thinking it a children's movie; many children will see the movie and come away from it confused about what it means, however (briefly) entertained they may have been by its gaudy mayhem. ""Rango,"" in brief, would be a better movie if its movie-makers had been less concerned with showing off how clever and cutting-edge they were and more concerned with how best to tell their story in ways that were both appropriate to and apprehensible by their intended audience. With an ""A"" for effort and technical achievement, ""Rango,"" alas, only merits an overall, ungentlemanly ""C.""",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Eh!,"As animated flicks go, this one wasn't too bad. Of course they didn't even attempt to go outside the box in terms of the storyline, but they did an adequate job of that in the set up in that the characters were chosen well based on what type of animal they were, although I did have a bit of a hard time accept the snake as a gun fighter, mainly do to the extraordinary means they had to go to for an armless creature to tote a gun in what was supposed to be an old west setting. Yet it had it's chuckles as it meandered along it formulaic way to it's predictable conclusion. But nonetheless still a good triumph's over evil movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

The best animated movie in a long time!,"Actually not just the best animated movie but the best movie, period! Johnny Depp and Gore Verbinski obviously make just as good a pair as Johnny and Burton.Rango is as fresh as they come, funny, inventive and just as irreverent as Jack Sparrow. In fact you can see why the idea of Rango was born during the time of Verbinski and Johnny together filming ""Pirates"". It's the same chemistry, the same madness and brilliance.Rango brings such a novelty into the screen, which is almost ridiculous, since it's by no means original, it contains endless references to previous movies, such as Don Juan De Marco, Fear and Loathing, A Fistfull of Dollars, just to name a few... But somehow it's fresh nevertheless and very, very funny! Rango is a lonely chameleon, an unfulfilled wannabee actor whose whole ambition in life is to make a difference with his performances, which are done with his broken up toys and lifeless fellow actors. We don't even know his name, all we know is when he is finally given the opportunity to act a grand part and above all the audience to watch him, he wastes no time and go for it with all his might.He might have bitten more than he can chew with his new character, but he certainly shines through it all, and the more public he has the better he becomes, bringing it all to a fantastic show down with the ultimate villain (Davy Jones reloaded).Wonderful movie, beautiful and state of the art CGI animation, incredibly entertaining, maybe not ideal for very young children, although not offensive in any way, but a very good family movie nevertheless!",,Anonymous,Animation

Yuck,"Rango has to be one of the two worst animated films I have ever seen (Shark's Tale being the other) and I walked out after the first 45 minutes. Full of violence, racism and profanity I can't see how this was ever promoted as a ""family friendly"" movie. Not only did it basically say that you can win only if you lie, cheat and steal but that these are the traits of a hero. While I am not overly sensitive I did find the overt racism and constant harshness to be irritating. Since I did walk out early I can't comment on the entire film but I will say that I thoroughly disliked what I did see. I should know by now that if Johnny Depp is associated with a movie in any way I will dislike it. Never again.",,Anonymous,Animation

How High Can You Aim When Your Whole Purpose In Life Is To Blend In?,"Industrial Light & Magic's first foray into the world of animation hits all the right notes for Rango is an endlessly fascinating recreation of the Wild West that brims with cutting-edge animation and is just as accomplished in its technical aspects as it is structurally sound in its narration. Jam-packed with clever references to classic spaghetti westerns yet retaining an originality of its own, the first feature-length animation film from the pioneering VFX firm is one of the best westerns to surface in recent years.Set in an Old West town populated by desert fauna, Rango tells the story of its titular character, an ordinary chameleon who winds up in the desert town following an unforeseen accident and in order to blend in, presents himself as a tough drifter. As the lawless outpost is in desperate need of both water & a hero, the thirsty chameleon takes up the role of sheriff in order to solidify his own image amongst the residents and selfishly leads an investigation into the town's missing water case that ultimately makes him confront his own demons.Directed by Gore Verbinski (best-known for Pirates of the Caribbean), Rango marks his first stint with the medium of animation and he does an excellent job at it for the story is deftly scripted, the plot is character-driven, there's a precision balance between its moments of action, comedy & drama, and just like the best spaghetti westerns, it is never in hurry to bring its tale to completion. The characters themselves exhibit interesting arcs & their roles are concisely defined plus the very themes of identity, heroism & adaptation are skilfully addressed.Industrial Light & Magic is best known for its groundbreaking visual effects in live-action films and yet the top-grade computer animation they put up here shows that they are capable of competing with both Pixar & DreamWorks if it ever comes to that. Every rendered frame stays within the realm of its genre. The barren desert landscapes, rugged characters, no law or order & other little details only enhance the look n feel of its story. And also admirable is its good dose of exciting gunslinging action & occasional staging of duels that add to the overall experience.From the technical standpoint, Rango gets nearly everything right. The set pieces are reminiscent of lawless outposts with little to no civilisation. The camera showcases a frenetic energy whenever it is required, the warm colour tones, improved contrast & apt lighting further enhance its imagery while the movements are fluid & expertly handled given the scene & its requirements. Editing trims out what the story can do without but there are still a few slow patches in the final print. And Hans Zimmer's inspired, energetic & exhilarating soundtrack uplifts the story by a further few notches.The contribution from the actors who give these animated characters their voices n more is often taken for granted but its importance is realised in this picture. Featuring an impeccable voice cast spearheaded by Johnny Depp himself, every actor does justice to their respective characters with Depp & Bill Nighy impressing the most. Depp has given us some truly eccentric characters in the past, many of whom turned out to be bigger than the films they appeared in, and Rango is certainly no exception for Depp's colourful voice input plays a vital role in making the chameleon stand out.On an overall scale, Rango is an ingeniously crafted, endlessly witty & beautifully animated western comedy that's refreshing, enjoyable & entertaining from start to finish, and for an animated feature, it is a surprisingly mature entry that's more aimed at well-versed cinephiles but it nonetheless promises plenty of fun & laughter to those who might be oblivious of its countless references & homages to past classics. Cleverly directed by Verbinski, bolstered by Depp's sensational vocal performance & meticulously brought to life by ILM, Rango isn't just one of the best films of its year but is great enough to rank amongst the finest examples of western filmmaking. Highly recommended.",,Anonymous,Animation
What an animated feature should be.,"I grew up watching old cartoons like Rocky and Bullwinkle, and one thing I've noticed with animated features in recent years is that they seem to think children are stupid and can't handle real plot lines. So to see something like this is like watching a miracle. This is a movie that both parents and children can enjoy thoroughly. It gives the children a great animated feature to enjoy that the adults can enjoy as well, however also it has many references to old westerns and other movies like ""Wizard of Oz"".The plot is that a lizard finds his way to a village in the desert called ""Dirt"", which is probably called that because that's all they seem to have. The main problem is that they are running short on water and for some reason the town well has completely dried up. The lizard who calls himself Rango after he gets into town is given the job of sheriff rather quickly after an incident in the local saloon. From there I will not give away any more of the plot because it should be enjoyed.The actors who voice these characters are great from the lead role voiced by Johnny Depp to the little girl voiced by Abigail Breslin. Stephen Root who voices a couple characters is one of my favorites. Then there's The Spirit of the West (if you've seen a couple westerns you'll know who this character is suppose to represent) voiced by Timothy Olyphant.Gore Verbinski who is known for the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies and here he seems to know his westerns through and through.The movie joins other films like ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" and more recently ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" as a film that is great for kids and can be even more entertaining for adults.",,Anonymous,Animation

The Vidiot Reviews...,"RangoThe best thing about a chameleon sheriff is that: no matter the skin colour of the criminal, they can never be accused of racial profiling.Unfortunately, the colour-changing lawman in this animated-adventure must oversee a town filled with different species.While traveling through the desert, pampered pet chameleon Rango (Johnny Depp) must learn to survive in the arid climate after falling from his owner's vehicle.Eventually, Rango makes his way to an Old West settlement, where he inadvertently disposes of a local bandit (Ray Winstone).Impressed, the mayor (Ned Beatty) appoints the hapless hero to the position of sheriff. His first duty, however, is to solve the mystery behind the town's missing water supply.A phantasmagoria of slapstick comedy and Spaghetti Western inspiration, Rango is a visual treat that will engage and impress young and old.Furthermore, with a tongue that long, he's also really popular amongst the local brothels.

"Amazing computer animation, smart script but lacks that fun feeling","Rango is an ordinary chameleon but finds himself centre of attention when he becomes sheriff of a town where the water supply has mysteriously disappeared.From droplets of water to an armed rattle snake the computer animation is fantastic and fabulously crafted but even with an array of talented voices Rango feels flat. Depps Kermit-like tone is fine but hard to warm to. That said, Timothy Olyphant's voice steels the show in a fleeting The Man with No Name cameo.Adults may get plenty of nostalgic enjoyment and the visuals may keep the young and old entertained with the script mostly going over the children's heads but it's not the family movie you maybe expecting- Tangled or Cats and Dogs it is not. It's a part Eastwood homage oozing spaghetti Western, but it's dark and even with the slick script it lacks that fun feeling. Think ILM effects meets 9 (2009) and Chinatown (1974), mixed with Once Upon a Time in the West (1968).",,Anonymous,Animation
A Rather Good Western,"I was telling my co-worker about this film, ""If you took out the jokes and the talking animals, you'd end up with a pretty good Western."" ""Rango"" does something that Pixar often employs, which is elevate animation to a higher level. This is a Western, with rather grown up themes and Western motifs that run deep in the storyline. I was briefly exposed to the trailers and thought nothing much of it, just marketing Johnny Depp as a lizard. But what we were treated to was a robust and rather surprising tale that's brilliantly animated. I started out skeptical especially with Rango as the main character, because honestly a lizard is not an especially appealing thing to look at for an hour and a half. But they managed to make the character likable and entertaining.That aside, I would consider that it's likely not as interesting for children, being that the humor does get a little macabre at times and between the accent and the highly stylized art direction, the film may seem boring or perhaps a little much.

Rango- A wonderfully different animated film,"Yesterday I went to see a truly different animated films, believe me when I say it's nothing like you've ever seen before. It's a western thats animated. It's a western where the animals are the main characters. It's a western about the decline of the west and how people in those times that couldn't adapt were left behind. Quite simply, it's definitely going to be on the slate for best animated film of the year. What film am I talking about? RANGO.First, let us address the issue of Rango as a kids film. Is it even a kids film? Well let's see: It's got mature themes, a pretty adult story, it's a western, it's got a menacing rattlesnake, and it deals with some pretty serious issues about dehydration, authority, and the need to believe in something. Does all this sound like something a five year old could fully appreciate? Rango is either the greatest kids movie in the history of film, or it's not a kids movie....PERIOD. That's right, despite it's cutesy trailers and Nickelodeon's producing it (Thumbs up to them by the way, They took a real risk with this film and it paid off. It's always great to see Nickelodeon stepping it up and allowing a pretty adult film to associate itself with their studio) Rango is NOT a kids film. Imagine that, an animated film that's not geared mainly at kids, how revolutionary is that idea??!! I look forward to a future where animated films can be made for 20-somethings and over and are not marketed at kids out of fear of stepping out of the norm these days and doing something different.For all of the risks the film takes and out of all the things that it decides to do differently, the one thing that would have really impressed me it failed to do...and that was market itself to its real demographic...Adults (and older teens to a certain extent). For some strange reason someone decided that Rango was a kids film/family film and was marketed as such (If they had actually taken time to watch the damned film they would have seen that it was a weird, surreal western and not kiddie fare). It also doesn't help that most parents see the PG rating and automatically assume the film is for kids. Either way, because of stupid parents and dumb marketing decisions kids flocked in droves like a bunch of angry, loud seagulls to Rango.Despite this one marketing flaw, Rango really is a magnificent, superb film that is required viewing for any adult. The animation is stunning, the character design is inspired and delightfully wacky, the story respects the western while also lightly satirizing it. Not to mention the main character of Rango is wonderfully unique. He is a wanna-be thespian that lives in his own secluded world, he is a lonely creature that doesn't realize how lonely he actually is until he is thrust out of his glass box. Once outside he goes through an identity crisis that lasts pretty much throughout the whole film. While Rango does have a few jokes that are aimed at kids, and while I do believe that kids could definitely enjoy it, that doesn't change the fact that a good 90 % of the film has references, themes, and jokes that will soar high above the little ones heads. by all means, watch it with your kids, explain it to them, maybe it will make them more well cultured, but that doesn't change the fact that Rango really is not a kids film in the end. I must say this is probably the best animated film I have ever seen, no joke,. If Rango does not win the best animated film of the year then I have officially lost all hope in the Oscars.",,Anonymous,Animation
The Spirit of West,"If you are a sucker of the genre 'Western' ( those lull before the storm moments, those slowly rotating noisy fans, those dimly lit bars with filthy looking goons gulping beer, those cow boy hats, those smoking barrels) and a big fan of Johnny Depp, and don't think animated movies are only for kids - you are absolutely going to love this movie.Rango is an ordinary blabbermouth wannabe-hero chameleon, who in search of adventure and spirit of west, reaches the drying city of 'Dirt' that awaits a saviour. And as expected Rango rises to the occasion.Rango is a work of genius - Best thing to come out from the association of Gore Verbinski and Johnny Depp. (I never liked the Pirates of the Caribbean series)Johnny Depp is brilliant or Wha What What???",,Anonymous,Animation
Works incredibly well for both adults and children,"After the debacle of the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels, Gore Verbinski needed a project that would possibly rejuvenate his reputation (he did some interesting work on films such as The Ring (2002) remake, and the little-known, but very effective comedy, Mousehunt (1997). So we come to Rango. another collaboration with Johnny Depp, and written by John Logan (Gladiator (2000), The Aviator (2004)). This delightfully animated film, tells the story of a chameleon (Rango, voiced by Depp), who is a wanna-be thespian, who wants to escape the confines of his glassed habitat. This dream comes true as he is knocked out of the back of a travelling car, onto a desert road.Rango wanders into the small ""wild west"" town of Dirt. a town that needs a sheriff. Here Rango decides to perform a character (as he realises there is no need to be himself). His stories of bravery infect the population and they take him on as sheriff. He then becomes involved in a conspiracy that endangers the lives of all the locals, as the water supply is dwindling, and Rango has to investigate to get to the bottom of the situation, with many ideas ""lifted"" from Chinatown (1974).The film is a western, and certainly the writer knows his films, as there are many references to the Hollywood classics, as well as the more well-known Spaghetti westerns (there is even a scene with Spirit of the West - a character that is quite obviously Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name from Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy. In the opening sequence, Rango attempts to cross a very busy road (clearly in this story the animals are somewhat behind than the humans - there are roads and cars in this universe, but the animals live in a rickety town of the post-civil war era), and when he is flung into the air, he lands on the windscreen of Hunter S. Thompson: ""It's another one of those damn things!"". Thompson is on his voyage of gonzo-discovery, fearing and loathing on the way to Vegas.Like Thompson's journalistic travels, Rango is looking for the American dream. Whether he finds it or not is irrelevant. This film is utterly delightful. A fantastic cinematic experience, beautiful animation, a collection of interesting (some obviously clichéd) characters, and a simple, yet strong story. All delivered in a package that works incredibly well for both adults and children.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",,Anonymous,Animation
a kind of western . at first sigh.,"nice, innocent,amusing, naive, sarcastic, homage, ironic view, joke, delightfully, little western in large clothes. its virtue - present an old story in new light. seduce new public with recipes of another time and make all sweet moral lesson.like a fable. or trip in yourself hided rooms. sure, Johnny Depp is the master. like always.but the world of small desert town is more large. in feelings, powerful characters, delicate solutions and taste of adventures. the Bank director, the doctor, the roadkill, the desecrated turtle, the charming rat and Beans are not only crumbs from another tales or result of great actors work but, in great measure, products of details science.that is secret - to give to every spectator what he hopes to discover. like new wizard o Oz.the gift - more than an Oscar.",,Anonymous,Animation
"A dusty, quirky western romp.","""You're a stranger. Strangers don't last long here.""Rango is unique, charming, and off-kilter. When Gore Verbinski and Johnny Depp got involved in an animated movie, chances were good that it would be something different than the usual. And that's exactly what you'll get with this.This is a western adventure at heart, starring a wannabe thespian chameleon who ends up in a drought-stricken town after he's accidentally abandoned on a busy desert highway. The first thing you'll notice are the visuals, which are a cool mixture of detailed realism and stylized elements. It took me a while to get used to how all the characters looked, I've never seen a similar art style. Once I adjusted, though, I really liked the unique look of the film.Older people will probably get more out of Rango than younger kids. There's not much of the slapstick humor of many of the most popular animated films, and much of the movie would fly right over children's heads. The voice talent is excellent and as impressive of a cast as any animated movie I've seen,The story dragged on a bit at times, and it could have been a tighter experience if it was about 10 or 15 minutes shorter, but I'm happy to say that Rango is one of the most refreshing movies of the type that I've seen in a while. Even if you love the Toy Story's, Tangled's, and Despicable Me's of the world (and I certainly do), it's nice to watch something a little different, from time to time. Rango fills that void quite well.",,Anonymous,Animation
This cowboy got some tricks unda' his hat,"Rango is charming, inspiring, beautifully crafted and, for once, it doesn't get cocky by boasting 3D. The film proves my point that a film, not in 3D, can still leap off the screen with its antics and fun. If Rango was in 3D as is, I don't think the 2D viewing would be any less enjoyable, but it would give audience members the impression it was another lame children's movie that's only gimmick is 3D.Director Gore Verbinski states ""Absolutely. But I mean, I'm responsible for my own kids and not responsible for anyone else's. So I think that's what PG means, ""parental guidance"" when asked if he thinks children are underestimated when it comes to movies. I completely agree. If I had, maybe, a six to nine year old I would definitely take them to see Rango despite its darker approach than more kid movies.The plot: A pet chameleon (Voiced by Johnny Depp) becomes stranded in the Mojave Desert when his home falls off the back of his owner's car. The chameleon takes the name ""Rango"" from a sign he sees, and meets an iguana named Beans (Fisher) who takes him into a town called ""Dirt."" The town is occupied by desert animals, and Rango learns there is a huge drought occurring in the town. With the minor help of the shady mayor (Beatty) and some other town-folk, the group sets out to solve the problem of the drought, and bring water back to their desperate area.No matter what Verbinski directs, he always darkens the atmosphere and I applaud him for that. The Pirates of the Caribbean series, a series I've never caught on to, I can tell from the first film it was a darker and more serious pirate adventure than the formulaic. Even his forgotten 1997 comedy Mouse Hunt, I've been told, has some darker elements.The voice acting, even though done by big name actors, still has a certain innocence to it. A good innocence. The kind of harmless tone to it. I fell in love with the Rango character, and how he was simple, yet complex in his journey. He reminded me of the unlikely hero which I'm sure he was representing. He was jittery, yet took acts of bravery. I admire that in a person.I think the key to really enjoying this film is the more you watch Western films. I, myself, don't watch a whole lot of Western films, but the more John Wayne you watch, the more caught up in the storyline you're likely to be. Its goal is to be very satirical, and boy is it successful. Fans of any Western film, and maybe even some Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas fanboys, will likely be dazzled by the humor in Rango.If someone had told me a film, like Rango, with fire breathing scenes, chase scenes, a sizzling snake that spins around frequently, and a good number of things that fly around was coming to theaters in regular 2D, I probably would've laughed. But seeing the execution should prove to people that you don't need to add another dimension to the movie to make it come off the screen. If you have enough action scenes that aren't over the top, that have a purpose and have a bit of a cheery nature to them especially in a cartoon, 3D scenes in a 2D movie will come natural.Voiced by: Johnny Depp, Abigail Breslin, Isla Fisher, Ned Beatty, Alfred Molina, Bill Nighly and Timothy Olyphant.
