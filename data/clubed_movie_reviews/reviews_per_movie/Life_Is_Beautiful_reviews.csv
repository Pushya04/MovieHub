Love is Beautiful...,"Emotional extremes abound, this story takes you round and around, elevating high, then smashing you down, your guiding light, an endearing clown.The essence of all that's right, that's wrong, a fathers love for his wife and son, to the thieves of liberty with power - and a gun; the worst of man, the world undone.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
The Best Movie I've seen for a long long time,"I am surprised about the negative comments that some people made on this web-page.  I can see how some people might not experience the same kind of uplift or joy that most of us lived through when seeing the movie.  But that some viewers felt insulted and betrayed because the movie did not depict ""reality"" as it really was or is, is not fair.I must concur with my fellow proponents of the movie -- it was a great and very satisfying movie.  It provided me with something that everyone in one or another shape or form needs -- Hope.  The movie showed the cruelty of life and yet managed to shed some light and insight into the beauty of love and life in general.I urge anyone who has not seen La Vita Ã¨ bella to go out there and watch it. If we all take with us just little bit of that hope and love that this movie is trying to convey; this world would be a much better place.Thank you for reading this and I hope you enjoyed or will enjoy the movie as much as I did.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
One of the best movies ever.,"This is one of those movies that have a lasting effect on you.   After watching it, I found that it has less to do with the Holocaust and more to do with the human feelings and the beautiful relationship of a father and his son.  The holocaust provides the ultimate context, that brings and highlights the story and adds yet another deep dimension to the movie.  No such piece of art has ever before combined laughter and tears of sadness in me before and that is the miracle of the movie.  The realism of the movie is not its strong point, but then again it is  not supposed to be; this helps in bringing the audiences to a state of mind away from reality, focusing on the feelings generated by forgetting about all external events and developments of the war.  Despite that, the movie does not fail to point out an element of the nazi psychology demonstrated by the doctor who was obsessed with riddles.  This portrayed the nazi 'state of mind' (if ever such an expression existed) as a sick mentally disturbed state.  Life is really beautiful as you watch Guido's relentless efforts to make a lovely exciting experience of the concentration camp to his son.  You get exhausted just watching him going through his painful day and yet you smile as he speaks to his son and makes him laugh.  One can go on forever  describing the creativity of this movie, but one will not be able to capture all its beauty in writing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"Funny, entertaining, and amazingly intense and dramatic.","I find it sad that so many people are so narrow-minded that they will not watch a movie that is black and white or, in this case, is subtitled. I feel sorry for people who refuse to watch a movie like Life Is Beautiful just because it is a foreign film. They have no idea what a beautifully acted and directed film this is, and they'll never know what an amazing experience they are missing.Life Is Beautiful manages to walk the extremely thin line between humor, fantasy, and tragedy. Sure, the film is clearly comedic, but nevertheless it manages to very effectively communicate the tremendous losses suffered in the Nazi concentration camps and has scenes at least as intense as any scene in Schindler's List.This is one of the best films that I have ever seen. It manages to be so encompassing that you hardly notice the subtitles are even there. I proudly cast my vote of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Courage Personified...10/10,"I can't understand how other reviewers see this as a film about the Nazis or the Holocaust. It's not!!! ""Life is Beautiful"" is a film about love, optimism, courage and inner strength.To be honest I can't get this film out of my thoughts and decided to write this brief review in the hope that I could move on.""Life is Beautiful"" is an unforgettable film. You go through emotions you were surprised could have for a fictional film. The story, although totally implausible, is uplifting and depressing at the same time.Please see it for yourself.

One of the Best Movies I've Ever Seen,"The first time I saw the movie was when I was about seventeen or so, and I never forgot it. The incredibly human characters (such as the doctor who loved riddles), the fantastic script-writing, the amazing acting, and of course the heartwarming story. This movie proves once and for all how strong we are, as humans, that in the face of adversity we can make the best of things. There is so much love in the characters; Dora's love for her husband Guido is boundless, as well as Guido's love for his son. Sure, it's a slightly unrealistic movie, but hey, aren't they all a little unrealistic? I've also seen people review this movie and say that it made light of the Holocaust, which was of course a dark point in history. I don't think so; I think that it's only delicately handled, and because of that, the movie is one that a person can watch in one sitting without being thoroughly disgusted by mankind. I would say that those who think this movie is too ""light"" are cynical and bitter. The whole point to the movie is to show what love is capable of, and to provide encouragement and perhaps guidance. This movie changed my life from the first time I watched it. I came away with this feeling that no matter what I have to face in life, that I can overcome it. This is a movie that I would recommend to anyone over the age of eleven. The acting is superb (though Roberto Benigni is a little over-the-top, LOL), the story heartwarming and easy to understand. It's excellent!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
A superb tragi-comedy,"Roberto Benigni's Vita e bella, is in many ways similar to Chaplin's Great Dictator.  Both are comic attacks on fascism, but the former's is the more successful.  Benigni initially accesses the emotions of his audience through simple comedy, which is a pleasant mix of Keaton and Chaplin.  Romance ensues with his real life wife Nicoletta Braschi.  The first half of this film has been seen by various critics as being inferior to the second, but this is certainly not the case.  In the first section we follow the delightful romance that will eventually lead to marriage and the creation of the wonderful Giosue (Giorgio Cantarini).It is the first half where the audience can laugh the loudest and delight at the immense comedy talent of Benigni.  Unlike so many films nowadays there is nothing crude or course, his is simple innocent humour, which is all the more effective.  The way he ties together little strand in the film to create comedy elements shows a great writing ability, and a mastery of timing when it comes to their execution on screen.  Various incidents related to the rise of anti-semitism and fascism in Italy show that there are sinister forces at work which come to the fore in the second segment.Guido (Benigni) moves events on from Tuscany in 1939 to the last year of the war in a concentration camp.  In this period he and Dora (Braschi) have had their son Giosue (Cantanarini).  The five year old greatly reminds me of Toto in Cinema Paradiso, and plays an equally important role in his prospective film (though in Paradiso's case it is at the beginning of the movie).  The relationship between the two is very similar to that of Jackie Coogan and Charlie Chaplin (though Benigni, unlike Chaplin, keeps the best of the comedy moments).  Guido attempts to keep from the boy the horrors of what is going on, and this eventually manifests itself as a game where the aim is to score 100 points, with the winner winning a real tank (which, of course appeals to the young boy).  Comic moments are still present, that involving Guido's translation of the rules of the camp is particularly notable, but it becomes somewhat more difficult to laugh when we consider the gravity of what is going on.The emphasis begins shifts, and we realise that this is a film about human spirit above all else.  Guido not only appeals to the audience due to his comedy and sheer pleasantness, but also in the way that he loves his family and the measures that he will go to to protect them.This is certainly no Schindler's List, but it never pretends to be. Occasionally events seem a little contrived, but this does seem to work in the film's favour.  However, this film avoids the tendency of Hollywood to go far over the top in emotional and credibility terms.Benigni shines like a lantern throughout the picture, showing that he is a talent, not only in comedy terms, that far outshines his peers.  Cantanari is a delight, and Braschi also plays her part well.  There is even an appearance by The Magnificent Seven's Horst Buchholz as Doctor Lessing, a man who events change for the worse.Please don't let the fact that it, to all but the Italians, is a foreign language film.  The language itself adds a beauty of form to the film, much as it did in the case of Il Postino.  This has to be a certainty for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar, though something tells me that it will be overlooked for other awards as it is Italian and not a mainstream English language picture.Please see this film, and make up your own mind.  It is appealing in so many different ways that I'm sure that you will not be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
The most aptly named movie - A classic,"I have never in my life seen a movie that so truly symbolizes its name and its message. Roberto Benigni - 'The Italian Treasure House' has probably given to his viewers his best. The story, the performances, the entire theme of a person performing his duties as a husband, as a father is very 'moving' and inspiring. 'Life is beautiful' as the name goes is about a Jewish man, who falls in love with a non-Jewish lady, marries her, has a kid and who is then taken as a prisoner in a concentration camp along with his wife and kid. But the way he protects his kid from the horrors of the genocide, how he always tries to find ways to make his wife and kid smile and laugh, is what makes the movie, a MUST SEE.It is certainly one of the best movies that I have seen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
A Movie About Hope,"Life Is Beautiful takes the premise that love and hope can survive the most trying of conditions, in this case a Nazi concentration camp. Most everyone knows this very popular and honored film, so I won't belabor the story. Briefly, in my humble opinion, this film deserves all the accolades it's been awarded. A near perfect film, my only gripe is that Mr. Benigni's performance could have been more understated, especially the half of the film that's set in the concentration camp. But this is only a slight complaint. For a joyful, life-affirming movie, Life Is Beautiful is tops. But be forewarned, as its principal backdrop of anti-Semitism and Nazi murder, it is not a very happy movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Outstanding,"This may be one of the best films ever made. I've never seen a movie with such a balance of hysterical comedy and serious drama. Roberto Benigni totally deserved his Oscars. People on this site have said such negative things about him and this film. Mr. Benigni had a lot of guts to make this film, and there's not another film like it. He handled both the comedy and drama aspects beautifully. I loved the beautiful cinematography, scenery, and the characters. This movie is magnificent in every way. Don't miss it!",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
The best foreign language film I have ever seen.,"I typically don't care much for sub-titled movies.  Foreign films to me are slow and about nothing.  So I naturally went to see Life is Beautiful with a chip on my shoulder.  I wanted to hate it.  I wanted it to be just another movie that Hollywood was praising to show that they were an intelligent bunch of people.  Oh boy was I in for the surprise of my life.  Not only is this film good, I honestly believe that it was the second best film of 98, next to Saving Private Ryan.  The mere fact that Shakespeare in Love won best picture over not only Ryan but over this, is a joke.  It's actually funny.Benigni did everything in this film.  He wrote, produced, directed and probably swept the floors at night.  There is that much raw energy in this film.  There really is.  For someone to have that kind of vision is truly incredible.  And not only is the film a terrific cinematic experience because of the importance and seriousness of the subject matter, but it is one of the funnier films I've ever seen.  When Roberto is translating the German soldiers insructions to his son so that he isn't scared, it is at that moment that you realize you are under his spell.  He's got you and no matter how much sceptisism you may have about the film you know you're witnessing a classic in every sense of the word.I loved this film.  Loved everything about it and I am so glad that I got to see it and cheer Benigni at the Oscars.  He certainly deserved his best actor award and he should have gotten more.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"A very moving, powerful War film.","Victims of The Holocaust, and placed in a concentration camp, Guido tries to make life bearable for his young son, and those around him.A fathers love truly can make the most horrendous situation, bearable. This is one of the most original, unique war films of all time, and whilst I know subtitles are a challenge for some, I beg you to stick with it, as it is a truly unique experience.This powerful film takes you on a rollercoaster journey, elevating you to real highs, then sinking you to painful lows. After a truly fun, amusing start, it changes into something very different, and you get a true sense of the misery The Nazis caused.Roberto Benigni gives a quite captivating performance as Guido, perfectly cast, he has charm, charisma, he's funny, and able to switch it up in a second.Wonderful visuals, as you'd expect, it's beautifully well made, produced with flair and style, even the scenes inside the camp.Quite an experience.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"Visually stunning, but uneven. For me the second half was better than the first","Before I eventually saw this film, I was not sure whether I was going to like it or not. While in general it is very highly regarded, there have been those who have said it is overrated or whatever. Just for the record, I did like the movie very much. It is uneven, and there were parts that didn't work as well as intended, but this is a brave and affectionate realisation of life during the Holocaust. I asked myself after watching Life is Beautiful, is it really overrated. Well, maybe a tad, but I can really see why people like this movie.So what didn't make this film perfect? Well, as I have stated at least twice already, it is uneven. And in my humble opinion, the second half was better than the first. I just want to clarify that I didn't hate the first half. Some of it is very funny, but some of the slapstick humour didn't work as well as it should, namely eggs breaking on people's heads. It also works very hard, to provide charm. That is perfectly acceptable, but because there was a lot of charm in the performances and the production values it felt slightly overdone. Though I will say that Benigni's tribute to comedy greats like Charlie Chaplin and Groucho Marx was inspired.The film changes tone to a more poignant, compelling and harrowing second half, that I think was much needed. While the character of Guido ""amusingly"" tries to convince his son Giosue that life in the concentration isn't so bad, the second half's tone has a lot of poignancy. Most notably Guido and Giosue trying to communicate to Dora over the loudspeaker, and the ending did have me in tears.That said, there are a lot of truly good things about Life is Beautiful. For one thing, it is sumptuously filmed. The costumes look amazing and the Italian landscapes look breathtaking. (If there is one place that I would love, love, LOVE to go to it is Italy, not only for the food but for the opera as well.) The story is an effective and affectionate one, about a Jewish man who falls in love with the help of his humour, but has to do the same to protect his son in the Nazi concentration camp. The quality of the script, I saw the Italian version with English subtitles, is thoroughly decent, and hits more than it misses.The performances are excellent in general. Roberto Benigni, one of Italy's favourite funny men, gives a admirable performance. He does overact at times in the first half but he appears a lot more subdued in the second. And I also thought he did a better job acting than he did directing. His direction once or twice in this film was a tad stodgy. Nicoletta Braschi is just stunning as Dora, she looked amazing in this movie and was solid in terms of acting. Giorgio Cantarini didn't always convince as Giosue though, there were times when he comes across as whiny and maybe I am being unfair but I have seen better child performances.All in all, beautiful to watch, and a nice story. It is very pleasant to watch with a compelling and poignant second half, but there are flaws that bring it down from what could have been outstanding to just a film worth watching. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Begnigni Ã¨ Genio (Begnigni's a Genius),"On seeing this film, my first thought (after wiping the tears from my eyes) was ""My god, he pulled it off.""  I can think of only one other director who's dealt with the Holocaust in a comedic film and done it with any depth, and his name was Chaplin -- and ""The Great Dictator"" was made before the horrors of the Final Solution were known to the world.  Chaplin didn't have to deal with that baggage.  Begnigni did, and did so brilliantly.The film begins as an earthy comedy as only the Italians can do and ends as a dark tragedy with a hopeful note -- and the transition from one to the other is seamless.  In fact, the latter half of the film would not work without all the meticulous set-ups of the first half.  That we get to meet Begnigni's character, see his world and hopes and dreams, makes it all only more poignant as they are threatened with destruction.  On top of this, the first half of the film is reminiscent of ""Amaracord"" (one of my favorite films) in appearance -- possibly a result of it being set in the same period, possibly intentional.  (Begnigni pulls off at least one homage to ""The Bicycle Thief,"" among other films, during the first act and a half.)Anyway... I really debated with myself before seeing the film, thinking, ""Hm.  A comedy... about the Holocaust.  Do I want to deal with that tonight?""  I went, I saw, and the film conquered me.  Fellini made me suspect that the Italians might be film geniuses... ""La Vita Ã¨ Bella"" made me realize they are film gods...See it.  Now.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
A beautiful film... but not an entirely perfect one,"When I first saw this film, I was told up front that the first full hour of the film, the first half, was all slapstick comedy and character development, and that the second half was more serious and important. I prepared myself mentally for the first half, but I was still surprised by how annoying the gags and jokes were. We're talking cake-in-face, fall-over, slip-on-banana humor. For one full hour. At the end of the first half of this film, I was thinking ""this had better get better very soon..."" And it did. Right then and there. From the very beginning of the second half, the serious mood enters. And it doesn't take long for even the most average minded viewer to realize that the first half of humor and character development was important. It was important for us to ease into a less tense mood, to make the important subject strike even harder, and for us to get to know the characters, to make us care more about what happens to them. I've just finished seeing it for the second time, and I've come to realize that this film is not entirely perfect, as I felt just after seeing it through first time. It does have its flaws, though there aren't many of them. The first half, and some parts of the second half, are heavy on humor, which some will mistake for making fun of the subject(which is almost a crime), or trying to make it seem less important. I don't believe this to be true, it's just a retelling with a more positive message; yes, people do horrible, inhumane things sometimes... but after all, there is beauty, too. The first half will also deter some viewers who will enjoy the second half much more. The plot is very good, though slightly unrealistic. The acting is pretty much all flawless, even in the child actors. The characters are well-written and interesting. The humor is more acceptable in the second part, because it's more toned down and not trying way too hard to get a quick laugh out of the audience. All in all, a great film which anyone and everyone should see at least once during their life... you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll realize that, in the end, Life Is Beautiful. I recommend this to just about anyone, but I know that not everyone will enjoy it equally. A near-perfect film. Keep watching past the first half... you won't regret it. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"Poignant , misunderstood masterpiece","There are a small handful of reviewers who are lambasting this film , crying phrases like ""unrealistic and contrived"" , ""emotionally manipulative"" and most risibly ""an insult to the memory of the victims of the holocaust"".Id like to address such interpretations.In the latter day audiences search for films bereft of clichÃ©, derivativeness and lack of independence there seems to be a counterintuitive rationale that if a film cannot be explicated and stand up to analysis from every myriad aspect of possible critique, then it lacks worth or merit , taken as a piece of work in its own right.It should be suggested that the intent of the film is so clear,the aims of the film so evidently manifest, that to brand the film unrealistic and then carp on with minor details regarding obvious inconsistencies, is to not be able to see the film for what it very plainly proclaims itself to be.This film NEVER tries to be realistic in the modern sense of film critique, this film freely admits to being contrived, this film unashamedly focuses on the characters at the expense of portraying an historically accurate reality.For the whining reviewers to not see this, is either an example of disingenuous folly or plain hard-heartedness.The film is driven by ideals, of romance and of selflessness.This film clearly asks the watcher to suspend belief, to enter into its fantasy, to embrace the human emotion as elucidated through the characters.Not only is this film NOT an insult to anybody who has ever been persecuted (Jew,Chilean,African,Russian,Japanese,Chinese,Cambodian - the list of persecution goes on), rather it heightens empathy for such people in this plight ,through the use of poignancy.Its intent is NEVER to trivialise such.Yes the uniforms aren't dirty enough , yes Guido takes ridiculous risks,yes the likelihood that the German guards knew some Italian are apparent but the question is - given the context of the presentation - do those niggling details matter ?Surely the film is engaging the viewer on an emotive level,evoking empathy for the individual case,for the desperation that sees a father moved to unthinkable extremes in an attempt to prolong the life of his son.Thus - surely , Guido's actions should not and never were intended to be 'realistic' but rather he is - to our despairing eyes ,simply pathetic ie he is evoking pity.How any discerning fair minded person could honestly and objectively brand this film as disrespectful and hateful because of comedic elements, is missing the point by oceans.This film is about the individual circumstance and thus the slapstick and ingenious way we are drawn into knowing the characters and the way we are immersed in the burgeoning love story of the small boys' parents, necessitates the audience to empathise,to engage,to feel.The by-play between father and son is to look at innocence personified,the bitter sweet forgoing of self in a seemingly doomed essay at escaping the impending inevitable spiral into oblivion.I think Life is Beautiful is an important work that might demand a rethinking of priorities by hard hearted critiques , who may have to shed that veneer of bloody-minded nitpicking and, to wit, see the forest for the trees.Of course the film is flawed,what film attempting such a tight balancing act between comedy and poignancy isn't? But there is a certain state of mind and spirit that needs to be adopted to be receptive to its message and i fear perhaps that such vulnerability and innocence required seems too hard and bitter a pill for some.If only they dare taste - its sweetness and candour resonate persuasively,indelibly.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Marvelous tale about  a  likable Jewish protecting his son  and wife from horrifying concentration camp,"Wonderful fable plenty of amazing fantasy, lively comedy and sad tragedy . This is a poignant and moving fable about a sacrifice to save a son and a wife . It's an unforgettable story formed by two halves that proves imagination, family and love conquer all ; as Benigni's focus is on the love between daddy , mummy and son . The first part results to be an Italian comedy style , the second is horror along with humor . It concerns upon Guido (Roberto Benigni, a magnificent rubber-faced funny man), a Jewish man who has a wonderful romance with the help of his humour, but must use that same quality to protect his son in a Nazi death camp . He's a madcap romantic man and women wish him . But he falls in love with Dora (Benigni's real-life sweetie Nicoletta Braschi). Every day Guido dreams of marrying her , under Nicola Piovani score . When the Second World War spontaneously breaks out , he and his family is imprisoned at concentration camp . Guido is determined to save his lover and son (Cantarini) from dangers around them . His effort sometimes is pure fantasy , though with ruse he pull off more impetus to keep his son and accomplishes feats no man could realistically execute . Guido fabricates an elaborated game to convince his child that the whole ordeal is an endurance proof to be won with prizes forthcoming , as it turns out to be a special contest to win a tank.This is a story about love , war and sacrifice , well starred and directed by Roberto Benigni who develops a fire-line between comedy and tragedy . Inventive gags and wacky humor are splendidly proceeded . At first consideration , the theme of a feel-good holocaust comedy war was a non-sense . However , Benigni doesn't describe a holocaust film but rather a tale of endurance of family love . Benigni tirelessly maintains the humorous ingenuity, even as the horror war escalates. Actor and director Benigni shapes simultaneously haunting and hilarious comedy out of the tragedy of Nazi concentration camp . In a especially humorous scene , Guido translates a guard's barking at the inmates as furthers clarification of the rules of game . The picture is divided into two parts , the first half deals with an entertaining boy-meets-girl tale , a light-weight comedy in which Guido relentlessly pursues Dora ; the second half shifts and depicts the horrors of the concentration camps . Good support cast formed by notorious secondaries as the Spanish Marisa Paredes , Lidia Alfonsi and Horst Buchhold as a Nazi doctor . The film displays an emotive musical score by Nicola Piovani, who deservedly had Oscar winner . Furthermore , it won Academy Award to Foreign film and of course to Benigni ; Roberto Benigni's Oscar for best actor marked only the second time that an actor had directed himself in an Academy Award winning performance , the other was Laurence Olivier for Hamlet . Colorful and glamorous cinematography by Tonino Delli Colli . Effective and appropriate production design by the veteran Danilo Donati . The motion picture was marvelously directed by Benigni. He's a good comedy director (Monster, Johnny Toothpick, Little devil) with some flop (Pinoccio) and usual actor for Jim Jarmusch (Coffee and cigarettes, Night of Earth, Down by law). Rating : Better than average . Well worth seeing .",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

A movie filled with love & hope.,"I love La vita Ã¨ bella/Life is beautiful. It's one of my favorite movies and Benigni is fantastic! I laughed until I cried when he translated the Nazi soldierÂ´s threats to Italian. I was skeptic to non-English movies before, but after seeing this movie I can easily say that I'm not. I thought it would be a problem that I didn't understand the language, but Benigni isn't just a talking actor. He is an acting actor, and I don't think I missed a lot being dependable to the subtitles. I sure hope not, but I guess you always miss a bit.I have seen other movies about the Holocaust, but they have all been so dark. Not surprisingly since the the Holocaust is a dark chapter in our history. But it's painful to watch them. It's easier to watch La vita Ã¨ bella, because it's not as dark, but it still succeeds in telling the story about the Holocaust.And Roberto Benigni doesn't joke about the Holocaust as some criticizers claimed. He simply puts some love and hope into it. And I get the message. Love is everywhere, even in the darkest of places.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"One of the warmest, love-filled films I've ever seen.","Written for my high school's weekly new supplement my junior year.I saw the Italian masterpiece Life is Beautiful twice before Thanksgiving and after I saw it I recommended it to just about everyone who crossed my path.  Unlike the last brilliant film I reviewed, Rushmore, this film should certainly be enjoyed by everyone, as it is as worldly a movie as you can get.  To say it is about this Holocaust is a gross understatement, for put together with the rest of the story which focuses on love, life, and love of life it almost serves as a background.The first half of this very different film by virtuoso writer, director, star Roberto Benigni is complete comedy.  It portrays the enamored main character, a life-loving Italian Jew named Guido, chasing after the woman of his dreams, Dora (Benigni's real-life wife, Nicoletta Braschi), who is about to be forced into an unhappy marriage.  The comedy is so pure, even if you don't enjoy some of the slapstick you cannot help be taken in by the heart that is at it source.  Eventually, through a series of hilarious coincidences, he wins Dora over, and together they have a son, Joshua (Giorgio Cantarini).Throughout the first half of the film, the audience catches glimpses of the evil that lies below the thick layer of humor and warmth.  It is World War II, and the Fascist regime is growing in Italy, and through a sign here and anti-Semitic comment there we get the picture of what is going on.  On Joshua's fifth birthday, he and Guido are taken away to a concentration/work camp in Italy.  Trying to save her family, Dora, who is part of a prominent Italian family and not to be touched by the Fascists, begs to be placed on the train and gets her wish, only to be separated to a special women's camp. Innocent Joshua, though, wants to know what is going on, and Guido explains to him that this is a big trip that he has planned for Joshua's birthday. The rest of the film shows the different ways in which Guido convinces his son that the camp is all a game, and if you score one thousand points (for such things as good behavior, being quiet during the day, etc.), you win a real tank.  Though occasionally Joshua senses something wrong, he has so much faith and  love for his father that he wouldn't dare doubt him.Though the second half of this film may seem depressing and unhappy by what I write, you will still smile at the love, warmth, and amazing humor that Guido, in this most awful time, still maintains just for the sake of his son.  In the first part of the film, the visuals are full of life, color, and beauty (in certain instances to an almost unreal extent), but in the second part, many of the colors are dull and lifeless to contrast the change in environment with the struggling brightness of Guido's hope and joy.  The beautiful score written for this film (including Offenbach's Barcarolle) is the perfect compliment to the different moods that are portrayed throughout the movie.By the end of this film, you are uplifted instead of put down by the bittersweet joy and the true beauty of life which is so wonderfully portrayed by Benigni's characters and story.  The acting is a flawless blend of humor and pathos, and the fact that the film itself flows so extremely smoothly between its two distinct parts alone shows what immense talent Benigni possesses.Life is Beautiful is a film that should be seen by anyone who has the chance to go out and see a movie.

Hidously Overrated,"I know little about the acting career of Roberto Benigni but I was told by a famous film tutor ( Who`s Jewish by the way ) that Benigni plays more or less the same character in every single film he appears in and I have no doubt this is trueAnd after seeing his performance as Guido in LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL and seeing Benigni clamber over several rows of seats to accept the Oscar as best actor I can`t help thinking Benigni is unable to play ANY character that ISN`T Roberto BenigniThis film is about the holocaust - The greatest example of mans inhumanity to man -  and that`s why it`s undeservedly well regarded . The scenes in the concentration camp are touching sad and funny as Guido explains to his son Giosue that they`re actually taking part in a contest to win a tank , but it also means sitting through a whole lot of irritating dross featuring Guido wooing his Princess . In fact the whole first half of LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL ( Written , directed , produced by and starring Roberto Benigni ) is an ordeal to sit through unless you`re a fan of Benigni . To be blunt if anyone deserved an Oscar it was Giorgio Cantarini as Best Supporting Actor as Giosue who gives perhaps the most memorable performance by a child actor I have ever seenTo be even more blunt I`m getting fed up with both holocaust films and the way they`re over rewarded at film award ceremonies . If  you want to know about the horrors and dangers facing Jews and wider human civilisation go and watch one of Pierre Rehov`s documentaries which are often held at Jewish cinema festivals where after the screenings security guards have to check under the seats to make sure no one has left a bomb for the next audience sitting , or access a website featuring a young self employed Jewish man called Nick Berg who went to Iraq to help with the reconstruction and where he was captured by Islamic terrorists who then brutally murder him by holding him on the ground and slowly hack his head off with a knife .Not praising LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL or indeed any holocaust movie is not anti semetism",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
A pleasant surprise!,"Didn't really think that much about what to expect of this movie and expected a sort of ""happy happy comedy"" where life's a dance on flowers. But a positive surprise the film appeared to have deeper tones, the movie is set in Italy right before and during WW2. The main-person is a jew and that causes bad things to happen. But in spite of everything that happens Guido keeps his spirit up to the last and shows a wonderful and humorous perspective of life. A must see!Notice how everything in the movie has a purpose. Every little thing that happens will serve a purpose later on in the movie. For example the weird habit of swapping hats with this other person at any possible occasion will serve its purpose later on in the film :) I liked this intelligent and highly entertaining way of bonding the story together. This and many many other things makes this film well worthwhile watching. Go see it and make up your own meaning!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Buongiorno Principessa,"Most of what happens in the movie is totally unbelievable, but realism isn't the point.It's a fairy tale that shines through the way it is told (for example the outstanding cinematography, transitioning from the beautiful scenery of the first part to the bleak setting of the death camp and of course the iconic music that deservedly won an Oscar) and mostly the power of its message. Hope can break into the darkest corners of the world. If you don't have any guns, you can fight with humour, imagination and, above all, love. Any life is beautiful as long as there's love in it and here we witness one of its purest and most touching forms, the love of a father for his son.Another asset of the movie, arguably its biggest one, is its emotional range. Many people compare Roberto Benigni's performance to Charlie Chaplin and it's easy to why, as he masterfully balances between comedy and tragedy, laughter and tears (by the way, his prisoner number is a tribute to The Great Dictator). This dualism makes the dramatic moments even more intense, nostalgia of the good times makes a dire situation even more hopeless.On a final note, I don't understand why anyone would find it offensive or insulting, the atrocities of the Holocaust come through as clearly as in any other movie with a similar subject matter.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"An unfunny, offensive and generally bad film","In my view this is an awful film. ClichÃ© ridden, woeful acting, idiotic storyline. Does anybody honestly believe that this otherwise smart kid would continue to believe the stupid story about the point gathering game ? Did we lose something in the subtitles ?This is a totally unfunny comedy (unless one thinks that falling on the floor or getting an egg squashed on one's head is absolutely hilarious. I used to but I haven't for more years than I care to count.)In my view, associating slapstick (and bad slapstick at that) with something as tragic as the holocaust borders on blasphemy. I felt sick in seeing this giggling buffoon prancing around trying to get a laugh in a concentration camp decor.Throughout the presentation, I couldn't make up my mind whether that main actor reminded me more of Jerry Lewis at his worst or of one of the three Stooges, except that the latter comedians did at times succeed in making people of their era laugh. They did not always take for granted that laughter being contagious, all one has to do is giggle intermittently and the laughs will follow.And no, the short scene depicting the bodies does NOT make up for the general lack of sensitivity displayed in the other 99.999% of this movie. In fact, this scene seems totally out of place in the storyline, as if the actor had mistakenly walked off the set. ...As if the ballet dancer had stepped on your toe.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
To See the Good Side of Life,"'La Vite Ã¨ Belle' touches very deeply into the concept of meaning of life. It's a study about seeing the beautiful side of the things, doesn't matter the nature of that thing. It looks like a hard theme to put in film, because it's not that easy to convince the viewer to buy such theme. So director Roberto Benigni picked a very controversial and somewhat extreme subject to put this idea in: The Holocaust. Hardly someone would think in a good side of the Holocaust, and certainly it hasn't any. But we can only cheer and appreciate what Benigni tried to do. He dared a lot doing that.And Benigni seems to be really the star in all aspects of this film. His acting was very impressive, it reminded me a bit of the Jerry Lewis performances, but it obviously has much more serious tons than the latter. Being said, the entire cast did a very satisfying performance.The film score(and the soundtrack in general) is perhaps one of the most beautiful that i've heard in a film. Really impressive. And so are the beautiful takes of the city. The scene where it's raining at night and Vito is escorting his 'princess' to her home is a highlight.So, if you are planing to watch this film, do it. 8.4/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Manifesto in humanity,"This film is a brilliant masterpiece. An expression of deeply felt humanity.Benigni is a clown - his comedy is often reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin. But he is also a great film artist. Greatly funny and wicked at the same time the impromptu speech of the school inspector who shows the students how superior the Aryan navel is.Heartbreaking the entire 2nd part of the film. A manifesto of humanity in the face of pure horror. Every father, every mother, and everyone who doesn't have a heart of stone will be in tears by the end of this film. Benigni has made himself immortal. Even 25 years later, this masterpiece has lost nothing of its brilliance and warmth. Thank you Roberto!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

"""Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming.  This is a fault.""  (Oscar Wilde, preface to ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"")","This film is a beautiful thing.Okay, perhaps that's cheating.  I don't really like responding to people who carp at ""Life is Beautiful"", mainly because I don't see how they could fail to have the required reactions.  How could anyone not find Guido charming? Yes, he's a pathological confabulator, but that's the point.  This is the story of someone whose way of life consists of enchanting the world around him with white lies (most of them are white) and manipulative genius.  He tries to continue living in the same way as the civilised world around him collapses; arguably, he succeeds, but he ends up paying a heavy price.  How could anyone not like this fable?And how could anyone not find both halves of the film - particularly the first, of course - funny?  It's the kind of humour where it doesn't matter if you laugh or not; either way, you can still enjoy the wit, and marvel at Guido's folkloric cleverness.  And on subsequent viewings it becomes more and more clear how the two halves set each other off perfectly.  Toccata and fugue. ...I understand the viewpoint of those who think that Benigni shouldn't have made a comedy about the Holocaust.  I can see how Holocaust survivors (and perhaps those close to them) might be genuinely offended.  But this doesn't make ""Life is Beautiful"" a bad film; it simply means, at most, that making it was an impolitic act.  I've heard interviews with Holocaust survivors who thought ""Schindler's List"" was a similarly impolitic act.  (And note that ""Schindler's List"", however good it may be, is clearly inferior as a work of art.)  If anything is wrong, it's the act of using the Holocaust as part of the subject matter of ANY work of art.  Benigni's particular way of handling the subject is as good as any other, provided he succeeds, which he does.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"Where there is love and a smile, there is hope","This movie is not only about the Holocaust.It is about surviving in a hostile world, that goes past hostile into crazy, with only wit and humor as a weapon.It is about shielding the child you love more than life itself from realizing the unimaginable horrors surrounding it.It is about letting your child inside loose in ""normal"" life and protecting you children from hostility and harm in an ""abnormal"" life.It is about sacrificing oneself for the ones you love.Roberto Benigni made me laugh and cry at the same time.  This film touched me in many ways.  With endless optimism Guido takes on the task of living his own life in a hostile world to say the least. When in a concentration camp with his son he uses stories and games and smiles to keep the HOPE alive.We don't have to SEE the horror around them to FEEL it.  The only time when horror is really shown, it is during a foggy surroundings and looks more like a painting.  Knowing what is there is quite enough.This movie made me think about all the people who did not survive the Holocaust.  Maybe, and hopefully, some of them had their Guido to help them keep their HOPE alive till the end.Bravo Roberto!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
A brave movie,"I've read all the previous comments. It's amazing to see someone advocating this is one of the best movies ever and someone else saying this is a very bad and offending show. Very few moderate comments...Usually a movie so much debated is at least interesting. I believe this is really valuable, first of all because making such a blend of humour and drama isn't easy at all. No other filmmaker did something like ""Life is beautiful"" in the past: the Holocaust, humour and a lovely story in the same film. Probably this is one of the best movies ever for bravery and originality, yes.Do you want a harsh, historically correct view of the Holocaust? Please read the books written by survivors, like Primo Levi's ""Se questo Ã¨ un uomo"", and watch original footage filmed at the end of the war, for example by the Russians when they entered Auschwitz, if you absolutely need something visual too. Even ""Schindler's list"" doesn't show the worst of that tragedy, for I believe it's simply impossible to represent such an horror with a fiction work, with actors and special effects. ""Life is beautiful"" doesn't want to represent the Holocaust, and IMHO this is a Good Thing.BTW, I'm Italian and Benigni here is a superstar; you see him everywhere on TV. If you saw the Cannes ceremony you have a vague idea about what he's capable to do. I saw him live years ago and he's even completely different: much better!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

But then there's the wonderful second act. It shows us the love between a father and son and how far a man is willing to go to achieve the happiness of his son. The second act is taken a lot more seriously and I consider it to be excellent. That being said I do think this movie is very uneven, and therefore overrated.

nauseating,"There are very few movies, no matter how bad, where I come away personally disliking all those involved.  ""Life is Beautiful"" is one of those movies. Why because beneath the shiny, happy coating ""Life is Beautiful"" embodies a narcisstic and almost nihilistic view of the world; I say this because Begnini et al. are apparently willing to use genocide to infuse a poorly written, badly acted, and sloppily directed movie with dignity it doesn't deserve.  And make no mistake this movie is all three.  The drama is fake, the segments don't flow, the acting sophomoric, the history laughable, and the characters stereotypes at best.  Begnini can do slapstick and there is a funny bit or two, but these add up to nothing and seem positively grotesque in light of what comes later.  This movie is the most banal and manipulative sort of crowd pleaser, the sort that assumes the crowd is composed entirely of idiots, but because it nominally concerns the holocaust otherwise intelligent people are unwilling to call the movies cynical little game for what it is, fearing the -""What you didn't like 'Life is Beautiful?!'  No don't say anything else you don't have a soul,"" or the more common, ""Well go back to your Jerry Bruckheimer movies.""  Well in all honesty that's an insult to Mr. Bruckheimer.  His movies may insult my intelligence, but never to the level this movie did.  At the predictable and overdone ending I remember thinking, ""I know what you want me to do movie, but there's no way I'm buying.""  Worse this movie is an insult to anyone who had to suffer because of the Nazis and their fascist allies.  Watching this movie I'm reminded of how Salem, MA uses historical atrocity as a kitchy tourist draw (going so far as to put witches on broomsticks on the sides of police cars). Begnini uses the holocaust to draw in suckers in the same way.  Group Mr. Begnini with the all those in the holocaust industry who are willing to use the worst atrocity of the 20th century to open wallets and flatter their inflated egos. Beyond being an insult to the victims of National Socialism  this movie is terrible because it crowds out much better movies on the same subject.

Ambivalent,"As a son of Holocaust survivors, I skip movies on this theme.  This is a protective mechanism that I use to avoid painful emotions, but it has denied me the experience of such films as ""Schindler's List"".""Life is Beautiful"", I was told, is not a holocaust film.  It is emotional, but deemed ""safe"". Well, I saw the film, and find myself strongly ambivalent about its message and content. I would love the oppurtunity to ask the creators:  did you simply use the Holocaust as a convenient backdrop to your story? Was it just stage and scenery for the players (much like the opera depicted in the film)?  Will others find similar Holocaust venues to fit their stories?  I don't have the answer.  I personally was hurt by the ""Hogans Heroes"" type story depicted in the second half of the film. I have been told by my own parents of painful yet poignant stories of parent and child in the Holocaust that contrast by their stark reality, to the fairy tale as depicted in the film. As stated at the top, I am ambivalent.  The film serves our children well.  More than any other film I have seen, it shows us, in a way a four year old understands, the absurdity of treating anyone, even ""Visigoths and spiders"", differently than we would want to be treated ourselves.  The acting is impeccable, the music uplifting, and the audience walks out greater for having seen the movie.  I only hope the success of this film does not give others the green light in using a very sad part of history in a way that lessens the memory of those who suffered through it.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
CLASSIC CINEMA IS BACK,"I will be brief: Benigni has made an instant classic, a masterpiece of humor over the worst drama in the history of the 20th century.

Dramatic Turnaround Makes It  Unforgettable,"I first saw this in a movie theater when it came out, and I discovered later it didn't remotely compare to watching it on DVD. The latter is a far better experience.It's spectacularly filmed, one of the better looking movies you will see on DVD: sharp as a tack and gorgeous, something a big screen kind of makes fuzzy. I found that more attractive than the story, even if it is a good one and one that you never forget.Few films have changed gears as dramatically as this one. The first half is a slapstick comedy-romance featuring the goofy Roberto Benigni, a hyperactive Italian who successfully woos a woman he accidentally meets one day. About 35 percent of this part in the film is clever and funny and the rest, kind of stupid....but not annoying. The only aspect that grows tiresome is Benigni's motormouth, which is always going and is just too much to bear after awhile. The guy wears you out, listening to him!The second half of the story jumps ahead to about 5-7 years later when Benigni and his girlfriend are now wed and have a little boy. Being Jewish, the man and his boy are then taken away from his little town to a concentration camp by the Nazis. The wife voluntarily goes, just to be with the other two. The rest of the movie shows how the father protects his son by pretending it's all a game. The second half, of course, is what most of us remember best and is very inspiring, a haunting tale with a few scenes that stay in your memory.On DVD you have the option of Italian with English subtitles or a dubbed version. Since the visuals are so good and the dubbing is expertly done, I would recommend that. It's a clichÃ© but, this is an ""unforgettable story.""",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Wonderful film,"Wonderful film. When I first saw this film, I was told up front that the first full hour of the film, the first half, was all slapstick comedy and character development, and that the second half was more serious and important. I prepared myself mentally for the first half, but I was still surprised by how annoying the gags and jokes were. We're talking cake-in-face, fall-over, slip-on-banana humor. For one full hour. At the end of the first half of this film, I was thinking ""this had better get better very soon..."" And it did. Right then and there. From the very beginning of the second half, the serious mood enters. And it doesn't take long for even the most average minded viewer to realize that the first half of humor and character development was important. It was important for us to ease into a less tense mood, to make the important subject strike even harder, and for us to get to know the characters, to make us care more about what happens to them. I've just finished seeing it for the second time, and I've come to realize that this film is not entirely perfect, as I felt just after seeing it through first time. It does have its flaws, though there aren't many of them. The first half, and some parts of the second half, are heavy on humor, which some will mistake for making fun of the subject(which is almost a crime), or trying to make it seem less important. I don't believe this to be true, it's just a retelling with a more positive message; yes, people do horrible, inhumane things sometimes... but after all, there is beauty, too. The first half will also deter some viewers who will enjoy the second half much more. The plot is very good, though slightly unrealistic. The acting is pretty much all flawless, even in the child actors. The characters are well-written and interesting.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

"Sorry, but a little overrated","This movie definitely has its moments but overall it is not more than a small charming melodrama which is worth watching but nothing too special.The hyperactive humor of Benigni reminded me of Louis de Funes which I find almost(!) unbearable. The contrast between the horrors of the concentration camp and Guido's effort to pretend it's all a funny game to keep his little son from the truth is quite a bit out of balance. This movie does not do justice to the demise of the prisoners in those camps. I'm sure it was not Benignis intention to show torture, violence and death as Schindler's List but in my opinion this subject does not leave room for extenuation for the sake of a friggin' movie. Overall this film tends to be quite naive (especially at the end)which, again, I think is intentional. Nevertheless, I don't like that at all. With all due respect for Benigni, his craft and talent and his father (who was held captive in Bergen-Belsen) this is playing with fire - in a moral sense. The romantic aspects are very naive too but also quite cute and funny - maybe just because of that naivety.Additionally I'm starting to get uncomfortable with the fact that even modern movies seem to be unable to shake the habit of showing German WW2 soldiers as nothing but fat and/or creepy squallers. But there have been movies far more worse then this one. So it's just a small bellyacher.It's a good movie. Charming and funny but with quite a few weaknesses. It surely would have been better to work on that superficial ""la dolce vita"" atmosphere.

This film has some sort of raw human touch that's snuck its way inside of me like a virus and subconsciously helped me enjoy the film.,"Well, Just the fact that I am writing this review says A LOT about this movie.  I have been going to movies religiously for as long as I can remember, and I have always seen films that I have considered ""greatness"", i.e.: Fargo, Saving Private Ryan.  But this film reached a new plateau within my film criticism rankings.  I am currently studying film in college, and I can't describe to you how this film has changed the way I will forever judge my own work in the future.  This film has some sort of raw human touch, But much different from other ""human touch"" films, I didn't realize I was becoming emotionally involved with the characters.  It just sort of got inside me like a virus and  subconsciously helped me enjoy the movie.The only negative criticism I've read about this cinematic masterpiece is that from people who are angered by the fact that it looks lightly on the holocaust.  It seems that these critics are upset because it doesn't show ""true justice"" on how the nazis tortured the jews. All I have to say to those critics is: Hey, everyone knows the nazis treated the jews like animals, we don't need another movie to remind us! If I had survived the holocaust I would MUCH rather see this movie than one that would bring all the horrible memories back.Also...if your thinking about not seeing this movie because of the subtitles DON'T WORRY.  This is my first subtitled film and everyone told me before I went in that I wouldn't notice them after awhile. And I was like ""yeah right, this is going to suck having to look at the bottom of the screen the whole time"". But it's true!!  I was bothered the first 5 minutes or so because I'm a slow reader and I was having trouble keeping up. But I soon got with the pace.

One of the best movies ever made...,"When my eighth grade English teacher showed us Life is Beautiful the Friday before school let out, I had never even heard of it, much less knew what it was about.  Well, after having seen the first forty-five minutes of this movie, I was entranced.  I quickly went home and rented it from the local video store.I finally got around to watching it Saturday night.  It was then that I discovered the absolute beauty of the movie.  I laughed throughout the first part, the sat entranced through the second, both intrigued and horrified at the horrors of the concentration camps.  I sobbed my way through the last ten minutes, then rewound the movie, sat down, and hugged my bewildered dog and cried for another twenty minutes.Life is Beautiful is an unforgettable film.  You quite literally go through every single emotion you are capable of.  Roberto Benigni's acting, through comedic and dramatic moments, is spectacular.Watch this movie.  You won't be disappointed.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
but this film is not,"Admitively, I'm not a big fan of Benigni and I don't consider his kind of humour as even remotely funny, but what makes this exercise such a truly unbearable experience is that good old Roberto chooses the Holocaust of all things as a gloomy backdrop to make himself shine all the more.Its always a big risk if the same person directs, writes and plays the lead and to my knowledge only Charlie Chaplin, Orson Welles, Vincent Gallo and Woddy Allen can get away with it. But all of them have some kind of self-deprecating approach. A quality that is completely absent with Roberto Benigni. What makes it all the more annoying is, that most of the people fall for it, as was evident in the cinema when I watched the film.So in order to make himself look good he writes a script that places himself in the middle of some very mean and nasty Nazis. Thankfully he doesn't need to bother with characters as everyone knows that the Nazis are are the epitome of evil anyway. But portraying himself as the tireless adversary of the oppressors isn't quite enough for Benigni. In order to hammer it home to the everyone that he is the good guy, he puts himself in charge of a cute little child, that he has to protect from the trauma of concentration camps. Sometimes this is quite easily done. As the two of them wander aimlessly around the grounds, they happen to come across a huge pile of bodies. We haven't realized this at first cause there was some very spooky fog floating around. Protectively Benini shields the boy's eyes from the unappetizing sight while the music reaches a dramatic crescendo. What a nice guy. This might seem like nitpicking to you but as they were apparently deported to a labour camp and not to an extermination camp, they wouldn't have come across such a sight. But any historic accuracy is secondary to Benigni as long as something gives him another opportunity to make out what a emphatic, altruistic and considerate character he is. Its so unsubtly done, it has to insult anyone with a bit of intelligence.I know, coming up with a comedy set in the Third Reich is always a tricky business but Lubitsch and Chaplin have proved that it can be done. Benigni though fails on all fronts. Some scenes are shamelessly nicked from 'the Great Dictator', in another some raw eggs are placed in a hat and you think that this is so corny and predictable and he can't possible have the villain don the hat (ha ha) and yet he does, and even worse, the audience around me behaved as if this was the funniest thing they'd ever seen. Well, if this is your kind of humour you're in for a real treat.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
A beautiful film teaching love and a tank creates ambition.,"Personal Rating: 8/10 (very good)This movie paints a picture of a beautiful day but then adds gloomy rain clouds. However, you don't have to look too closely to notice the rainbow, the thing of beauty, that shines through.Right from the onset, you know what's coming, for over an hour you just wait, smiling through the highs, laughing at the humorous lines, and grow anxious during the lows, but nothing prepares you for how the movie concludes.There were two themes this movie impressed upon me, two reasons I would implore you to watch this film.
The sacrifices made by a loving parent. There's nothing that compares it goes beyond all human logic and reasoning because it's motivated by love.Ultimately, life is beautiful. Having a beautiful life does not mean having a perfect one, always smiling and laughing, no, life has ups and downs that's what makes life life. It's up to us to decide whether or not to make life beautiful, to never let go of the highs and let them carry us through the lows. When you feel at your worse like you can't go on, it's focussing on how close you are to 1000 points, that will keep you going.Win that tank.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

a good film,"The outbreak of the little man, is always more moving than the hero's counterattack. Hunger, fear, and all the bad conditions were not enough to bring him down, just as he had desperately held DORA's hand and held her tightly in his arms. The beautiful life is Guido's life, ordinary but shining. He thought of his family reading Joshua and DORA and thinking that they must be safe and gamble their persistence and courage in the future, no matter whether they can survive or not. In the second half of the film, I finally understand the reason why DORA fell in love with Guido, more than his humor, more than his courage, is a layer by layer, pure heart.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
A Beautiful Mix of Humor and Tragedy,"A movie should aim to awaken the viewer's emotions, whether it be love, sadness, excitement, or a blend of feelings. La Vita Ã¨ Bella is a film that delves deep into one's emotions and touches the soul in a profound way.Roberto Benigni's Oscar-winning performance truly marked his career, with every line delivered full of excitement and joy. The phrase ""Buongiorno principessa,"" repeated throughout the film with increasing joviality, becomes a signature moment, as Benigni expresses it each time with both his body and heart.At its core, La Vita Ã¨ Bella is about the fight for greater good in the face of overwhelming adversity. While the Holocaust serves as the backdrop, the film is not strictly about this tragic event. Instead, it explores the universal struggle to preserve dignity, love, and hope even in the darkest times.Guido's strong character is established early on when he persistently pursues the woman he loves, using his wit and charm to win her heart. This same determination and strength of character are later mirrored in his actions during the Holocaust, where his fight is not just for survival but for the preservation of his son's innocence and humanity.Life's journey, especially when intertwined with an unfair and invidious system, often challenges and changes one's ideals. However, Guido's life motto, as reflected in the film's title, remains steadfast. The movie effectively shows how injustice can disrupt one's love life and the upbringing of a family, but it cannot lead to personal degradation if one is rooted in strong morals.A good role happens when an actor fully understands the director's vision. A perfect one happens when the actor is directing himself. This is a must-watch in a must-watch list.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
I Agree 10 of 10 and bring tissue,I am in agreement that the story is implausible but utterly moving. I sit here and think about Captain's Courageous and would place it in the same category. It will make you cry. What a beautiful story of love and sacrifice. Children are always worth saving and any sacrifice for them is moving. I do not know why there is a minimum number of lines to submit a review of movies on IMDb. That is a change from the original rules. I'm not a film critic and barely find time to write this review. I was very happy to receive help from IMDb in identifying the movie and I am surprised that it was filmed so recently. It deserves 83 ranking and I hope it remains there so that others will get a chance to discover it.,10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Absolute perfection,"There are few words that can sum up the sheer beauty and perfection of this film without somehow sounding mediocre. In today's cynical and disbelieving world, Roberto Benigni has taken another cynical and disbelieving era and somehow, emerged with something triumphantly astounding. Never have I seen such an emotionally empowering film. You laugh, you mourn, and in the end, you cry from the overwhelming sense of love and hope that still seems attainable. After watching this movie, I went and hugged every member of my family. You really believe that life is beautiful. The hope and optimism you feel, your tear-streaked face- it's all beautiful. Roberto Benigni, you are beautiful.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
one of those movies that have a lasting effect on you,"I have never in my life seen a movie that so truly symbolizes its name and its message. Roberto Benigni - 'The Italian Treasure House' has probably given to his viewers his best. The story, the performances, the entire theme of a person performing his duties as a husband, as a father is very 'moving' and inspiring.This may be one of the best films ever made. I've never seen a movie with such a balance of hysterical comedy and serious drama. Roberto Benigni totally deserved his Oscars. People on this site have said such negative things about him and this film. Mr. Benigni had a lot of guts to make this film, and there's not another film like it. He handled both the comedy and drama aspects beautifully. I loved the beautiful cinematography, scenery, and the characters.This is one of those movies that have a lasting effect on you. After watching it, I found that it has less to do with the Holocaust and more to do with the human feelings and the beautiful relationship of a father and his son. The holocaust provides the ultimate context, that brings and highlights the story and adds yet another deep dimension to the movie. No such piece of art has ever before combined laughter and tears of sadness in me before and that is the miracle of the movie. The realism of the movie is not its strong point, but then again it is not supposed to be; this helps in bringing the audiences to a state of mind away from reality, focusing on the feelings generated by forgetting about all external events and developments of the war. Despite that, the movie does not fail to point out an element of the nazi psychology demonstrated by the doctor who was obsessed with riddles. This portrayed the nazi 'state of mind' (if ever such an expression existed) as a sick mentally disturbed state. Life is really beautiful as you watch Guido's relentless efforts to make a lovely exciting experience of the concentration camp to his son. You get exhausted just watching him going through his painful day and yet you smile as he speaks to his son and makes him laugh. One can go on forever describing the creativity of this movie, but one will not be able to capture all its beauty in writing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
A very enlightening story!,"I've seen this movie today, and I must say that this film is very good. There are many reasons, and I will name some of them.The story is great and different from other WW2 movies. It is about heroism without action, but with words. A man falls in love with a woman and after some years they have a baby. Unfortunately at that time (1944) they are Jewish, and things turn out very bad. The story tells us that you can put fear away with humor.The acting is very good, and the cast is also very well put together. All actors perform great throughout the whole movie, especially the main character and the little boy.It's a very special film. One you can't find on the screen very often, maybe once a decade. Therefore I recommend it to everybody. Your day will be good after seeing this one, it's full of humor/suffering/sacrifice/happiness.My score 8 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
The most overrated movie of the 90's,"Despite its unusual approach (it's a holocaust comedy) this is at heart a fatally self-conscious, shamelessly lowest-common-denominator film with the subtlety of a brick to the head.  When he isn't straining to act 'lovable' (actually coming off as obnoxious), Benigni keeps busy pushing every easy emotional button he can think of.  But why should we care?  His romance is never made believable, and the horror of the holocaust is never made real, because the way he edgelessly films it, we might as well be watching a film set in a medium-security prison.  (The movie numbers a grand total of one effective dramatic moment, which is Benigni's artfully handled last scene.)The lowest point in recent Academy Awards history is when Roberto Benigni won best actor for this film (he was up against Nick Nolte, Ian McKellen, Edward Norton and Tom Hanks, all in career-best performances, for god's sake!).If you feel such a strong need to be manipulated that you don't care that the guy doing the manipulating is a shallow egotist, then this movie will suit you just fine.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
One of the best piece of Art,"While writing the comment on this movie I was just wondering what kind of words I should use for the appraisal of this master piece. I am an Indian and I saw this movie in Hindi dubbing. But the language is not a matter of barrier for such piece of art to communicate the mass. The liveliness of Guido till the end of his life is really inspiring. And the depiction of scenario during 2nd world war is very realistic. The movie starts with fun, comedy along with his friend Feroccio and then his romance mix with fun with Dora. The scenario becomes darker when they are kept in jail but still Mr. Guido keeps the movie alive as well as his son from Nazis. The most touching part comes when Guido is taken by the soldiers to kill and he tries to make his son smile for the last time and his promise to his son for the tank is fulfilled when the US army comes. The movie is a comedy with a hidden tragedy. It's a story of a father, his love for his son and for his wife under the shadow of world and the activities of Nazi during the time. We should also thank Mr. Roberto Benigni for such a beautiful piece of art. The movie has a long lasting effect on the viewers who have to think about the movie and Mr. Guido, the character whom the movies run around. Life is always beautiful for such a person because he makes life beautiful.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Schopenhauer,"The first time I saw this movie I didn't remember the references to Schopenhauer, but now I've read said philosopher and was thinking about the point in using him in this movie. At first it seems like a mistake. After all, Schopenhauer is of the major philosophers, the most pessimistic. So it's strange to have him portrayed positively in such an optimistic movie. I think the movie is reinterpreting his philosophy from an optimistic perspective. Reinterpretation is a strong part of all classic works. For example, Virginia Woolfe has a crazy man interpret Shakespeare as being a misanthrope in 'Mrs. Dalloway.' Basically, Schopenhauer says that humans are conditioned by evolution to choose life over everything horrible that could happen, and that we have no choice but to obey. 'Life is Beautiful' takes this reality to be a positive. Really, it's an affirmation of the inherent goodness of life. So I think the Schopenhauer references work perfectly here.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"Beautiful, Bold...Brilliant","First of all, a brief summary of the film(without spoiling the plot): Roberto Benigni plays Guido Orefice, a Jewish man who moves to Arezzo with his brother. With the help of his humour, some daring and quite a lot of luck, he wins over a Nicoletta Braschi's character, a schoolteacher. Five years later, he and his son are taken to a concentration camp, but his wife successfully manages to persuade the Nazis to let her in too.La Vita Ã¨ Bella is on of those rare films that has the quality to make you laugh and to make you cry within its two hour runtime. Its starts as a romantic comedy(with some very funny gags) but ends as a wartime drama; a fact that may send viewers into confusion, but ,personally, I enjoyed it. The fact that it is in Italian didn't put me off at all.The calibre of the acting is superb, particularly that of Roberto Benigni in the lead role and that of the young child actor, Giorgio Cantarini.The music compliments the bittersweet tone of the film excellently, as does the contrasting vibrant cinematography at the start and then the dull grey concentration camp at the end.Overall, a stunning performance from Benigni not just as an actor but as a director and scriptwriter as well. I think that he thoroughly deserved his Best Actor Oscar, and was unlucky to lose in the best director and best script categories. I have not seen Shakespeare in Love, the film which La Vita Ã¨ Bella lost to in the best picture category, but judging by the standard of this film, I'm not sure whether it deserved it or not.Having looked at some of the other reviews for this film, I have been shocked to see that many people don't even like it. For those who say it is not a true depiction of the nazi camp, then I say that they are right but this is not meant to be a film just about the harshness of the holocaust, but a film primarily about Roberto Benigni's relationship with his son. The humour I leave up to you, but I personally found it very enjoyable.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
life becomes beautiful,"I consider this is perhaps the best movie in any foreign language i have seen yet. Its plot is so gripping and inspiring you wont believe till the end. The performance by Italian actor Roberto benggini was so superb. The whole film is full of humorous jokes and moves. In reality he was trying to just try to divert the attention of his loved ones from the cruelties , desperation and sadness of life. The most impressive is the way he be fools his son that when they are caught in the web of Holocaust administered by Nazi Germans , he tells him and other folks that this is just a game , the won who scores most points in it will emerge as victorious and the prize is brand new tank. I loved the way really never let his son know what is going on in his surrounding and saves him from the pain , sadness and disappointment about the future. I think such films can motivate us very much about the way of living our lives. I recommend it highly to watch. If you are not moved by watching it then i am quite sorry about you but it will one day impress you one day if you watch it again at least.

"Absolutely amazing, one of my all-time favorites","This movie is simply brilliant. Casting aside all of the trappings of modern movie-making (special effects, brain-jarring sound, big name stars, bizarre plots and settings, language sex and big explosions) it produces instead a film which captivates audiences because of its simplicity, classy acting and the sheer beauty of its tale. In what may well be the hallmark of a great movie, opinions of LIB are markedly polarised - the number of '1' votes are about equal to the range of 2-6, strongly illustrating that it is difficult to be indifferent to this movie. This is a major difference between LIB and most of what Hollywood churns out where indifference is the only acceptable response. It saddens me that so many people have failed to recognise the charm of this film by choosing to take offence at the way in which the Holocaust was portrayed. I am not Jewish (or Romany, Eastern European, handicapped etc) and would not attempt to presume to tell any of these groups how to react to this portrayal but I can say that I was more moved, more hurt by man's inhumanity towards man, by LIB than I was by Schindler's List or any other Holocaust movie or doco. I, like many others, came out of this film wanting all my friends to go see it. The sub-titles in no way detract from the experience, in fact they are hardly noticeable after a little while.

good,"The first 30 minutes were funny, the last 1 hour was very emotional. I really liked the movie, maybe it can be even more emotional when watched by a father. Roberto Bengini licked and swallowed the role of excellent acting. The right people played the role of both father and child. The subject is also very good. It's impossible not to fall in love with the Guido character. But if you say the movie was perfect, it wasn't. For example, the atrocities committed by the Nazis have never been well described, it was terrible in that regard, this is the most glaring mistake of the film. The leading father Guido laughs all the time throughout the film, he does this to make his child believe that what happened was a game, but maybe he could have shed secret tears from his son in a scene, I'm sure he would have been much more emotional then. The role of the mother could also be more active. Finally, the scene that I found wrong is the father making sacrifices throughout the movie, taking care of his son, but at the end, he's not worried about his father at all in the scene where the child hugs his mother, at least he could have asked where my father is. Despite all this, it is a very nice movie that you will be able to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"This movie is an insult to anyone who has experienced the real holocaust, not this contrived, farcical version.","Words escape me!  Perhaps ludicrous, contrived, insulting come close. There is nothing factual about the depiction of the holocaust in this ridiculous, totally unbelievable mess.  Death camps were not nasty places where people toted weights around, got a little dirty but remained shaven, were able to keep their sons not only hidden but alive and well despite a starvation diet, had access to records, phonographs and loud speakers, could basically move about at will and suffer little more than the inconveniences of a run down boarding house.  This movie claims the camp where our heroes sojourn is a death camp, (not one of the thousands of concentration camps that were located throughout Nazi occupied territories) complete with gas chambers and ovens.  There were only six death camps, all in Poland, and all were dedicated, absolutely dedicated, to the dehumanization unto hideous death of their inmates.  Slow agonizing demise from Zyklon B was the easy part; twenty minutes of choking, while clawing at your throat and eyes and it was over.  The devastating removal of every vestige of humanity through constant beatings, lack of sleep, lack of food and water, lack of any semblance of medical care, torments that ate away at body and spirit over endless days, was the intolerable part.  No one ever spoke to a guard without being shot on the spot.  Guido would not have been taken around a bend to be killed, he would have been shot, or beaten to death, or hanged, publically to display for the other prisoners both his impotence and the Nazi's total control over life itself.  It is absolutely impossible for a boy to have been hidden for a day much less weeks in a death camp.  To depict this living hell as a Stalag full of Schultz's, largely ignoring at least one of the inmates, who gets to clean up and wait tables, with his son, no less, is an insult to every person who has been touched by the real horror of the holocaust. This would have been a great propaganda film for Goebbels to have shown to the Red Cross to show how humane the Nazis really were.  If this was meant to work as some laugh-your-way-through-life's-troubles allegory, then a vehicle more appropriate than the greatest genocide ever perpetrated by man against man should have been chosen as the vehicle.  As it stands this movie is a travesty.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

He is so subtle in his performance, so funny yet being so serious at the same time.He always will be remembered for this role.Dora, played by his real life wife, Nicoletta Braschi did full justice to this role and the chemistry between the lead actors was nothing short of outstanding.The rest of the cast contribute significantly with Joshua, played by Giorgio Cantarini standing out among them.

He invents a game for his son that will keep him away from the horrors of the war.Although the horrors were not made obvious by Benigni (why would he when you and I know what happened in WWII) we could see the desperation in Guido to hide the reality from his son so he may survive. I get chills just thinking about it as I write. Subtle in its horror but effective as a tragi-comedy.For those who do not understand Italian there is a point near the end of the film where a ""riddle"" is asked of Guido which I believe was meant as a hint to stay off the trucks.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Schlock at its lowest level,"I saw this movie soon after its American release, before the massive wave of buzz set in.  At the time, I remember thinking that America's intelligience level had to be much higher than the level this film speaks to.  I was wrong.  This movie might as well have been directed by Joel Schumacher (who, in my opinion is the worst director in Hollywood)  Pure schlock.  This movie is on the same level of Patch Adams:  cheesy, brainless and horrible.Everything in this film is weak: the script, the pacing, the cinematography, and especially the acting.  Roberto Benigni winning an Oscar is the equivalent of Danielle Steel winning a Nobel Prize in literature. The only point of this movie is to make the viewer cry.If you are interested in a foreign film that shows how the relationship between an doomed father and an unwitting child should be played, watch the Russian film Burnt by the Sun.

One-line summary?  Don't miss this movie.,"I put off seeing this ""romance"" because of a basically grumpy temperament. Now I will want to see IL POSTINO as well. Don't want to miss any dimensions of humanity made available through a great and deep comic personality.I'm an older person who first learned of the Nazi concentration camps through documentary footage from the Nuremburg trials shown in my Texas high school.  How to ever recover from this knowledge, much less the actual experience?  Well, to paraphrase Andre Gide, you don't get to the far shore without losing sight of the shore behind you.Roberto Begnini and his fine cast welcome us to the far shore.  Here, the love and care for family and children is far more important than any personal pain, even one's own death.  That the character Guido is capable of clowning for the hidden eyes of the child while being taken away by an armed soldier is a lesson in courage as great as in the great samurai films.The quiet and surprisingly strong character of Dora gives a third point of support to the power of LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL.  Her insistence on going with her family to the camp is humbling when you recognize her options and test your own ability to sacrifice any comfort or advantage. The love between these three -- the adoration of the father by the child, the care between the parents and love for their child -- reflects a transcendent reality which is played against brute power in the ongoing battle between Heaven and Hell.How can we endure such pain?  Through comedy, through love . . .And please also credit for depth of situation shown to the gentle old uncle, the Nazi doctor going crazy, the Italian school director easily embracing Fascism as she might embrace any other new educational fad.  Also must credit the patient horse and the kitten.  In SCHINDLER'S LIST (black and white), a touch of color, a little red coat, (thank you Akira Kurosawa -- see HIGH AND LOW) made sharply poignant the loss of a child in the camp. Here, a live kitten looking for the child who cared for it is left with the pile of clothing of the dead children.  Life gone, life remaining.Life IS beautiful . . .  the movie is teaching us.  Learn, the undercurrent of it whispers, and live well.  I'm really grateful for this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"Beautifully-executed celebration of human spirit - no more, no less.","`Life is Beautiful' is a rarity Â a simply conceived and executed story about the strength of the human spirit in adversity. It is rare because it manages to deliver a message without beating you about the head with it and getting caught up in its own mission. Neither does it sternly point a finger at the audience which many Hollywood `message' films seem to do these days. Rather, it shows how, even in the conditions of Jewish persecution during the Second World War, people can rise above themselves for the sake of their loved ones. End of message.The film is a delicate balance of humour and pathos, and, unlike many other reviewers, I didn't feel the concentration camps were treated with levity or belittled. The horror is there, but understated. This was how many war victims and sufferers of other atrocities throughout the ages have managed to turn aside the terrible spirit-crushing events they endured Â with a gag or a laugh.Roberto Begnini is brilliant, and inhabits his character totally as though born to the part. The romance between him and his `Principesse' is touchingly romantic, and Giorgio Cantarini is terrific as little Joshua.I found this film very satisfying and moving, mostly because it said what it had to without moralizing, making its impact all the more effective.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Spectacular,"'Life is beautiful' is one of those films that manages to be outrageously hilarious, and heartbreakingly sad at the same time. I have personally never come across another film like it. Roberto Benigni is spectacular with his portrayal of a man holding his family together in the face of overwhelming disaster. This is one I'll be watching again. And again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Uplifting and heartbreaking,"While some may complain that Life is Beautiful does not portray death camps in the appropriate level of detail or realism, the simple fact is: Life is Beautiful is not intending to be a faultlessly accurate portrayal of concentration camps in World War II Germany. It could also be pointed out that very few (if not none) contemporary movies can even come close to fully portraying the horrors endured by Jewish, Polish, and Gypsy people in such camps.That said, the film itself needs to be addressed. Life is Beautiful follows one idealistic and offbeat Jewish man's life, love, and experiences when the Germans take he and his family. The central plotline is this man (played sensitively by Roberto Beninini, who also wrote and directed the movie) trying to keep his son alive and sane in the camp. In this way, the film sometimes reminded me of Hogan's Heroes, with a Jewish man in place of the American soldiers- with the Nazis being the butt of jokes and generally being outsmarted by Bennini.But to say this piece is a fairy tale or a comedy far from the truth, while it is true that the movie never really approaches the real horror of a concentration camp- that is not to say that it is a happy movie. It is feel good, I'll give it that, but you will cry during the movie. Perhaps it is the fairytale quality that makes such loss all the more powerful, and when you consider a lot of this movie is focused around a confused and naive child, it is actually powerfully done. By 'glossing over' the horrors (as a child undoubtedly could), the inevitability of loss is made so much more painful.This movie was, and still is, one of the finest movies I've had the pleasure of watching. The subtitles are a minor issue, but easily overlooked. Simply put, Life is Beautiful is one of the few emotionally driven movies to be acknowledged as real cinema in recent years.See if you liked: Big Fish, The Devil's Arithmetic, The Green Mile. Strengths: Has the viewer's emotions on a string, excellent music. Weaknesses: Lacks realism and subtitles can be distracting,",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Life Can Certainly Be Beautiful ****,"A positive outlook on life during such adversity, this is the central theme of the excellent holocaust film ""Life is Beautiful.""Roberto Benigni was voted best actor by the Motion Picture Academy for his portrayal of a Jewish man, who when imprisoned by the Germans during World War 11, tried desperately to rid his young child of fears by making a game out of the holocaust.The film begins with the very funny courtship of Benigni and his wife, who is not Jewish.Horst Buccholz, so young and charming in ""Fanny"" appears as an Italian army official. They years have matured Buccholz. It was sad reading of his passing a few years after this marvelous film came out.The scenery is breath taking and Benigni alternates his feelings in a terrific comedy-drama performance.Just as liberation appears to be imminent, Benigni is shot by the Germans.

"Life IS beautiful, but I prefer to take the ""Train of Life""","When I rented this movie, about 2 years ago, I thought I was going to love it. It already had an Oscar and the ratings on IMDb were very high, so could it not be great? It was a BIG disappointment! I thought `Life Is Beautiful' lacked consistency most of all. It this movie was a Holocaust fairy tale (!?) for everyone to enjoy, it should have ended with the nazis and prisoners dancing and kissing each other, because `love conquers all'. If it was a comedy, I should have laughed more than twice. And if it was realistic, it would have ended sooner and tragically. Fortunately, my family didn't experience the Holocaust, but I have read enough about it and seen enough pictures, that I can never understand how you cannot be offended by this movie. I think a lot of people don't realize how wrong it is to trivialize the Holocaust, because it doesn't seem real to them. Can anybody even imagine a comedy about 9/11? I didn't think so. Maybe 50 years from now, when it doesn't seem so real and tragic.Last week, I watched `Train Of Life', an European co-production about the inhabitants of a small Jewish village in Central Europe who organize a fake deportation train so that they can escape the Nazis and flee to Palestine. The subject seems as unrealistic as LIB's, but the very surprising ending makes the movie brilliant! I absolutely loved `Train Of Life', the story, the acting, the music, the humor, everything about it!I wanted to learn more about Radu Mihaileanu, the Romanian director (a Jew himself) and found an article from ""Le Nouveau Cinema"" (feb.1999), entitled ""Inferno Train"". According to ""Le Nouveau Cinema"", director Radu Mihaileanu, who also wrote the script for ""Train Of Life"" wanted Roberto Benigni for the role of Shlomo, ""the village foul"". He sent the script to Benigni in 1996, but was refused politely. Strangely enough, less than a year later, Benigni was directing his own Holocaust comedy movie! Having trouble with finding financing for his movie in France (because of the delicate subject), Mihaileanu started filming a year later. This delay was more than enough for Benigni and his `La Vita E Bella'. His movie was out in theaters in Italy, during Christmas, while `Train Of Life' was still in editing. Because of the scandal surrounding the 2 movies, Gilles Jacob, the person in charge with the selections for Cannes, refused both. After Miramax bought the rights for `Life Is Beautiful' for 7 million dollars, the movie was finally selected for Cannes! In spite of everything, `Train Of Life' was nominated and won awards (about 9) all over the world. It even won the Audience Award at `Sundance' (tie with `Run Lola Run'). I recommend `Train Of Life' to everybody!",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Best,"Sentimental and contrived, Benigni's well-intentioned Holocaust framed may only work as a children's fable. Inexplicably, it won a prize at the 1998 Cannes Festival. Audiences will be laughing hysterically while crying their eyes out. If this is a fantasy, it is probably a compensation we need when facing the reality of history. The film's highlight is one man's battle to keep the ugliness of the world from his innocent son, no matter how ugly the world might be, and in this case that means the death camps of the Nazis. I think you have to give this film credit just for having the guts to address a heavy subject like the Holocaust in the manner done here, which is predominately with a lighthearted tone. That's a big risk, but it mostly pays off here.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Kids believe the darndest things. This is supposed to be heart-warming, even though it just plain isn't. The writing is just never really good enough.This movie doesn't really have much going for it in the first 100 minutes or so, but the ending is nice. It's really touching and all. Okay, the power gets thrown in the dumpster because a dead character doubles as the narrator, but it's still good. The idea behind this film is Oscar-worthy, but the way it's done is often just boring and Guido's joking isn't that amusing to me. Maybe others can see the humor is not shutting up but I don't.

The story's the thing...,"This is the kind of film that, once you finish it, you're afraid that, because it's subtitled, not many people will see it due to the seemingly inherent laziness of the general viewing public. It's disturbing, because I left this film wanting to tell everyone I knew to go see it immediately. Fortunately, credit was given where it was due in this case, and the film got the sort of exposure that no other foreign film has gotten in my memory (I'm 28.) This is not the best film I've ever seen- that honor is still held by The Godfather. It's not the best foreign film I've ever seen- that would be Kurosawa's ""Ran"". It's not even the best Italian film I've ever seen- I still hold up Fellini's ""La Dolce Vita"". But it is, without a doubt, a great film. Begnini has a gift for comedic pathos that was previously the sole possession of the late, great Charlie Chaplin. People who profess a problem with the ""realism"" of the concentration camp need only take two things into account- 1.- Have they ever even seen pictures of newsreels of any camps in Italy? I know I haven't- they were always the Polish ones. 2.- The realistic, accurate depiction of concentration camp life is not the point of this film- if that's what you're after, try ""Holocaust"", ""Sophie's Choice"", or ""Escape From Sobibor"" to name only a few. In this case, the story's the thing- a man who so loved his son, and wanted him to feel safe, is able to convince him that the whole situation in the camp is a game.

This is a beautiful film.,"Any movie about the Holocaust must be undertaken with great care.

His father Guido was able to protect him from the true horrors of the camp, and that is why it is a sanitized, not realistic perspective of his early life. This movie is not primarily about the Holocaust, but rather about the human qualities that can make life beautiful.

Mental patients belong in asylums, not in power. I guess as a homage to good fathers, the movie is somewhat more tolerable. Many children of families with limited means grow up thinking that they are first class citizens thanks to protective fathers that sacrifice to give them that impression. But why should dad have to sacrifice so much?It's a silly movie. I guess they are running out of angles to examine the holocaust from. I know eventually this will happen. It has to.The movie itself is a competent offering. I thought the first ten, fifteen minutes were intolerably boring. It becomes more entertaining with the visually stunning party and street scenes.

The most overrated Film of all time!,"I will never understand why this film and the star (Roberto Benigni) were/are so highly praised. This film is mediocre and plain pathetic at what it tried to do.

I will never understand how this won any Oscars, or what exactly made this a great film. Now some of my favorite films are those that deal with WWII (""Downfall"" for example) and the Holocaust. (""Schindlers List"" stomps on this.) I appreciate what was trying to be said about the inhumanity of the Holocaust, and the fathers love for his son in keeping the truth from him. I just felt that it was very repetitive and didn't say or do anything that hasn't been said or done before in film. It is still rated in the Top 100 a decade later so there is obviously those that think this is still an excellent film. I would hope that people would watch it again and see if they still feel that this is really one of the best films of all time. I just can't see how this is rated in the Top 250 when there are so many other better films that are just out of it. Doesn't it make you wonder why we have never heard of this film really since?

Nauseating Holocaust Farce,"I usually don't take time to make reviews about movies I don't like. But this one managed to infuriate me in such a way that for once, I feel I have to make an exception. Now I don't reject as a principle the idea of a comedy about the Holocaust, but mind you, it is a very sensitive subject, so you have to be really talented in order to afford carrying out such a project.I admit the first part of this flick does get some laughs, but not much more so than some easy entertaining comedy that you watch to relax after a long working day. That's not exactly what you call big art. It would be OK if the movie tried to be a parody of a Fellini movie for example. Roberto Benigni is certainly a gifted slapstick actor, but hardly more profound than Jerry Lewis or Louis de FunÃ¨s. Actually, if I want to laugh my head out, I'd rather watch Mister Bean instead.But sorry, I don't think Benigni can compare to Chaplin, and if you compare this film with ""The Great Dictator"", sorry again, it falls short. First, ""The Great Dictator"" was shot in 1940, and as such, it was obviously much more of a dare and of a statement to make a caricature of Hitler while he was still alive. Secondly, Chaplin knew about Yiddish culture, and the portrayal he made of the Jewish quarter for instance, as a parody, had at least some connection to reality. It is pretty obvious, on the other hand, that Mr Benigni doesn't know much about the subject he is dealing with, and did not care to document himself about it. By the way, Guido Orefice does not sound very Jewish, but it could be translated from Italian as ""Guy Butthole"". No, I'm serious.What is obnoxious from the start is that Benigni seems to be quite self indulgent, naturally convinced that as an accomplished Italian buffoon, he is totally irresistible. He makes a caricatured court to his wife in real life, and it seems to take a few poor jokes and calling her ""My Princess"" so that she falls into his arms. The point of Mr Benigni seems to be more or less that : I am so funny, I am so genial, that I can take the most horrible and the most taboo subject I can find, and it will infallibly become as funny and genial as I am myself. That's as narcissistic as can be. When does Mr Benigni plan to make a comedy about pedophilia?Now, the second part is really hard to take. The concentration camp looks like some severe prison in Switzerland. There were actually no children in concentration camp barracks because they were GASSED right away, and I wonder how long our irresistible Mr Benigni would have lasted in Auschwitz. Probably the Nazis would have thought he was so funny and genial that they would have him perform his laughable tricks while somebody was hanged...Besides, I think lying to children in order to make them believe that life is a bed of roses is a very dubious philosophy. Children are not as stupid as one would like to think, and they generally feel when they're lied to. Transposed into a political context, lying to people in order to make them believe that ""life is beautiful"" has already been done many times.Thanks to Mr Berlusconi who started his career by creating a trash-TV empire, the Italian cinema which used to be one of the most productive in the world collapsed in a mere few years. Here is what remains of it. Bravissimo.The final ""happy ending"", with the kid laughing his head out while he is riding on an American tank with a white star made me so angry I wanted to punch my TV! I don't remember having ever experienced such a feeling before.For those interested in Holocaust comedies, if you can get hold on that, check out ""Train de vie"". It is not the greatest movie, but since Jewish people took part in it, it is already much funnier, much more realistic, and much more respectful. As a long time movie lover, I am genuinely appalled beyond words by the success and recognition Benigni's despicable flick managed to achieve.I don't even want to give this movie a rating.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Poor taste,"I went to see La Vita Ã¨ bella when it was first released, in Italian, and knew nothing of the plot.  I loved the first half.  Typical Benigni, a clown that tries to win over the charms of a pretty woman (his wife in real life, as usual).  It was the same sort of thing as many of his films, e.g. Johnny Stecchino.  I'd give it a nine for the first half.  But then the second half left me horrified.  I suppose it was meant to.  I wasn't expecting it. While I recognize how well made the film was, I just can't see how you can make a film half comedy and half holocaust.  It was meant to make you laugh and then cry, and so it did, so I guess it was a success from that point of view.  But sorry folks, I'd rather watch Johnny Stecchino when I want to laugh and then Schindler's List when I want to see a harrowing story of the holocaust.  Putting them together for me was in very very very poor taste.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Overblown and extremely overrated,"I find it awfully strange that everyone is embracing a movie that strips the Holocaust of any of its meaning.  This movie asks us to laugh at the events transpiring on screen, but not to feel or understand any of the horrors.Benigni would have done his film a lot of good had he given us more of a feeling of how the people's lives were in terror.  Then, the message of the transcendence of love and life would have been so much more powerful. Instead, he merely laughs everything off, giving us the feeling that even he's not taking his subject matter too seriously.So, in the end we are left with a movie that trivializes the Holocaust - and people should be ashamed that they think so highly of it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

"Okay, but not as great as it might have been.","There seems to be a fair amount of controversy surrounding this film, but after seeing it I have only a bare glimpse of why.  Sure, it is something of a light-hearted tale set in a death camp and one can see why offense might be taken at that premise alone, but the humor is not used to make light of the situation, but rather serves as factor that mitigates the horror for us and for the boy who it is directed at in the film.  I do think that Benigni could have made the death camp scenes darker as that would have made the contrast created by his behavior stand out all the more.  The Nazis never achieve the truly commanding status they must have occupied in reality, instead they come off as dull buffoons which is something that might have been reconciled to create a better film.  But then we must remember the function of the framing device which locates perspective on the young boy, so we have now a tension between what we know of the reality of the situation and the fantasy world that Benigni creates for his son. This is an interesting tension, but it is never drawn out fully enough.  In only one shot do we ever get a sense of the loss of life that was the eventual outcome of these camps, and even then it exists in sort of a dreamscape so it is hard to say whether or not it really existed at all.  If the scenes of Benigni away from his son had contained more horror the film might have been more able to build on the fantasy versus reality theme that seems so crucial here.  Since this is the boy's story, the scenes of Benigni away from him lay outside the realm of his personal memory, so they exist as constructions implying that either the son has extended the cloud of fantasy retro-actively over things he learned about the camp or the filmmakers did not wish to break the aura that they created.  I would tend to think of the latter as a the more probable cause.  Benigni is crafting a fable here and applies a ""fable-istic"" aura to all of the proceedings, but frames the story in the perspective of the boy (post-Holocaust)  thus opening the possibility to break down the wall of fantasy and insert scenes of tragedy that might have made Benigni's act all the more heroic. This criticism aside, there are quite affecting moments in the film.  In the moment Dora chooses the forsake all for her family and follow them to the death camp, Benigni has created a piece of pure, selfless melodrama that illustrates the ties that bound families together in that time.  We know Benigni must die, and thus the scene of his death is oddly unaffecting.  But by pairing it with the coming of the tank at the end Benigni has made both moments all the more affecting.  Life is Beautiful is not a great film.  It might have been, but it never really explores the battle between fantasy and reality that is the core of the film.  Fantasy wins out and reality only makes a few insertions making what could have been a truly uplifting homage to the human spirit somewhat dulled.  Not dulled enough to consign it into the realm of mediocrity however, as there are enough good moments to make this a film worth watching.  Benigni's courtship of Dora is quite sweet, even if I find the Benigni character a bit overblown for this film.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

broad slapstick and heartfelt drama,It's 1939 Italy. Jewish Guido (Roberto Benigni) tries to open a bookstore but he continues to face hurdles with a smile. He falls for the lovely Dora (Nicoletta Braschi). She is engaged to an ambitious government official but she runs off with Guido. They get married and have a son named Joshua. The fascists would catch up to them but Guido would pretend the camp to be a giant game so that he can hide the truth from his son.Roberto Benigni is going for extremely broad comedy here which turns eventually. The movie is always a bit odd to have slapstick comedy while the audience knows perfectly well what is happening. It makes the movie unfunny. The movie is much more compelling as a heartfelt drama.,7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"Moving, Wonderfully Scripted, Passionately Acted","This film is frequently written off by commentators as trite and mawkish, or criticised for using comedy to make light of the Holocaust. Admittedly when compared with its counterpart 'Schindler's List', it is positively upbeat, but in reality it balances comedy and drama with considerable skill. I see it as one of the greatest cinematic tragicomedies ever made, comparable to the likes of the masterful 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'.The best thing about the film is that it approaches its tragic subject matter from an alternative point of view, doing so with grace and respect. It's so important to be able to view tragedy through a lighter lens in order to move on from it, and if done right (the Coen Brothers do this very well, and Chris Morris' 'Four Lions' is also a great example of it) then comedy can be the best way to do this. 'La Vita Ã¨ Bella' is one of those few special films that manages to do ths very well, though it maybe could have worked on its denouement just a little more, as the ending feels a tad truncated.This is undoubtedly the Roberto Benigni show: he both directs and writes, whilst delivering an incredibly committed performance as the wonderfully witty Guido Orefice. His barrage of verbosity forms the bulk of the film's tight, often hilarious script, and the first, pre-Holocaust half of this film could easily have been expanded to stand on its own as a riotous romantic comedy. Benigni effortlessly switches from quick-thinking conman to archetypal lovesick Italian sweet-talker, and finally a tireless father who goes to extraordinary lengths to protect the innocence of his son.The rest of the cast is small and tight, with Benigni's wife Nicoletta Braschi delivering a stellar turn as the object of Guido's affection. Giorgio Cantarini, who would later play another tragic son in 'Gladiator', is adorable as the heartwarmingly upbeat child GiosuÃ©.Ultimately this moving, finely-crafted work is one of my favourite Holocaust films, though admittedly in a drastically different manner to other greats like 'The Pianist' or 'Die FÃ¤lscher'. A must-watch for anyone, though it will certainly not be to everyone's taste. 92/100",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

"""When can I see Mama?""....","....""When the game's over."" The year is 1939. Guido Orefice (Roberto Benigni) is a cocky Italian waiter of Jewish descent, and is bent on winning the heart of Dora (Nicoletta Braschi), a beautiful schoolteacher. To do this he uses his talent for turning up in unexpected places and his witty humour and charm. The entire first part of the film is based along Guido winning over Dora and is played with a comedic feel. It isn't until the latter half where the film becomes truly beautiful.Five years on, Guido and Dora have GiosuÃ© (an adorable Giorgio Cantarini), their only son. Their life is peaceful but disturbance arrives when Nazis take away Guido, GiosuÃ© and Guido's softly spoken Jewish uncle, Eliseo (Giustino Durano). It is only with difficulty that Dora succeeds in convincing the Nazis to take her, too (even though she still ends up separated from Guido and GiosuÃ©). Desperate to shield his son's fragile young mind from the horrors of the Nazi camps, Guido creates a game for GiosuÃ©: you gather points for things like staying hidden and following orders. The first person to reach 1,000 points is the winner and receives his very own tank. Naturally, GiosuÃ© is happy to play along.However, the illusion becomes harder to maintain as the camp conditions worsen. GiosuÃ©'s faith in his father sometimes wavers and Guido must be strong for the sake of his son.I'm not going to reveal what happens, but I will say that it will probably stir up a mixture of emotions.When I first heard about this film, I found it hard believe a ""Holocaust comedy"" could be believable or enjoyable. But this film displays a level of dignity and heart which strikes a chord with the viewer. The beautiful chemistry between the three leads is touching, especially that between Guido and GiosuÃ©.Benigni's acting strength comes not only from his comedy talents but also the powerful love he is able to show as an actor. Braschi also is wonderful as Dora. After her family is taken away, Dora says to the Nazi officer in a voice both frail and strong: ""My husband and son are on that train. I want to get on that train. Did you hear me? I want to get on that train."" Her gently unrelenting character lends a motherly side to the film But best of all is Cantarini as little GiosuÃ©. His wide eyes and expressive face give a different touch to film with a kind of brutal honesty. It is so, so hard to describe the way the film *feels* when he is on screen. You are seeing it from the perspective of both the father, the mother and the innocent and painfully unsuspecting child.Wonderful film---8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

A comedy that lacks brilliance and respect,"Would ""Life is beautiful"" have had so good reviews, had there not been part of the movie about the holocaust ? I really doubt it. This movie is only a dull comedy that lacks brilliance and is based on rather silly gags. It is also flatly shot. But the real bad part on that movie is that by showing the concentration camnps as it does, it lets the audience think that the Holocaust was not so terrible after all. Begnini shows the concentration camp as if it was the Warsaw ghetto : people are working hard and some die in the process, but the very idea that there were some gas chambers working in order to annihilate millions of people is hardly evoked. The very fact that the little Giuseppe survives with so little trouble is hardly acceptable when one knows how mercilessly children were exterminated. Of course, some passages of the movie are full of emotion, but they are only minutes in a two-hour movie for which Begnini lacks the necessary tact to use such a subject. If I do believe that his intentions were pure and noble when he shot this movie, I hardly appreciate the intense marketing surrounding it.

The trouble was that the worst of times was the Holocaust in an Italian concentration camp, and I kept thinking - this is terrible! As time goes on and the Holocaust becomes a thing of history, and as less survivors are alive to remember the travesty that mankind let occur, Benigni is being praised for making a film that DOES trivialize some very serious subject matter. History that is only half a century old. I think the film itself is a noble and creative effort, much like the characters in the film, but the cartoonish depiction of genocide and desperation did not sit well with me. The audience I was with laughed and cried on cue. They were manipulated. Just like the Nazi's were manipulated in Germany. I'm sure Benigni's intentions were noble, but noble intentions don't merit unconditional praise and Academy Awards. Maybe we should feel good for the child that was saved form the horror of his situation, and then maybe we should pity him for his ignorance. I'm not so sure, but I'm not laughing and crying on cue.

Even at the most bitter moment he sweetened everyone's and his son's life with a joke or a smile.

Credit must also be given to its shameless sentimentality, bad jokes, shoddy plot, and the flagrant narcissism of its ""creators"".And to my fellow reviewers who maintain that this is not a film about the Holocaust but rather the importance of familial love, I should like to say two things:  One, you're confusing the film's theme with its subject, and two, if Benigni didn't want to make a movie about the Holocaust then perhaps he shouldn't have SITUATED HIS STORY IN A NAZI CONCENTRATION CAMP!!",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Touching in a way never experienced before,"Being an avid movie watcher for some time I have become aware of many films that try to portray 'love', with a vast majority falling way short. However, what you have here is a movie of such invention, passion and true spirit that it is almost inconceivable that one man could be the genius behind it all.The start reminded me more of a Peewee Herman film (for those who are familiar) than anything else, with comical humour almost over used. But as this film develops it becomes something so special that I will remember it always. To portray such a simple story so effectively requires genius, which Guido has in abundance. I don't need to say anything in particular about the film as you must watch it, but be rest assured that it will leave you touched in a way that is very rarely achieved in cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Painful,"I hated this film for so many reasons I do not really know where to begin. I am sick reading reviews that claim Roberto Benigni as the new Chaplin. Chaplin this man is not. Slapstick is a bit like ballet, it is either really good or painfully bad, and this movie was painfully bad. I am not a snob when it comes to humor but some of the scenes were so ridiculously mediocre and rigid that it took me all my patience not to vomit (as a previous reviewer claimed to accomplish after watching Schindlers list).Furthermore, I am sick of people saying...""well it was just the portrayal of the Holocaust as a child would have seen it"". What nonsense. Why would a child see the horrors and mindless brutality of a concentration camp any differently than an adult? The reality was that women and children were immediately separated from the men and often marched straight to the gas chamber. To suggest that someone could just hide a child under their bed for the duration of the war is ludicrous. The character Guido was able to strut around the camp like he was on some kind of a vacation, mocking his German guards as you would an incompetent schoolteacher. The German guards were portrayed as the proverbial straight guys and the butt of a joke that I could never fathom.Maybe I am missing something here but anyone who left this film with a warm fuzzy feeling is profoundly ignorant. I do not agree with the many reviews that say ""if you want the real story watch Shindlers list"" or ""this is a fine example of the spirit of man in the face of adversity"". This is an example of nothing more than a poorly constructed comic farce that uses the Holocaust as a backdrop. The Holocaust was about the brutal mass subjugation and extermination of six million people. It should never be portrayed as anything less, and in this film it was.  The Holocaust should never be used as a comic platform for a father and son bonding farce.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Is it that beautiful?,"I had fun watching this film, but I was not so extraordinarily impressed as other people did about the whole project. I guess because Holocaust is so overly done that even a cute comedy/tragedy can look same as the other films made about the subject.Yes, acting is excellent, and the plot is interestingly imagined, that it really makes it very interesting to watch, but I simply was not so impressed as other people were.I recommend that you watch this film if you did not already, I guess in 1999/2000 everybody had to, it was that type of film and year.We will remember as Mr. Benini was jumping all over the chairs as he made his way to receive his Oscar.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"How the reviews for this came in as they did, I can't imagine.  I think maybe people like to hear themselves say aloud that they loved a movie with subtitles.","This movie is possibly the most wretched abomination I've ever been forced to endure.  Never was I amused, stimulated, impassioned, engrossed, or even interested.  Divided into two independent halves (which in and of itself isn't necessarily bad), it proceeds to bore and insult the unfortunate viewer with two seperate stories.  The first of these unlikely tales involved a horribly contrived and utterly loathsome tale of a man and a woman falling in love.  Basically, he drags her around the city to various locations where he knows something specific will happen, such as a man tossing a set of keys down from a second story window to a locked-out friend, and she falls in love with him.  Whoopee.  Nothing is done here that hasn't been done a thousand times over in better movies.  The second half amazingly and deftly trumps even the first's diabolical drabness by continuing its utter bore-fest, but then contributing what may be the most insulting, degrading, and unholy storyline ever to grace (or in this case, curse) the screen.  The filmmakers evidently thought it appropriate and amusing to have a good chuckle at the expense of all of those sustained and killed in Nazi concentration camps, as the one in this film is depicted as more of an expensive resort than a death camp.  Of course, there were token scenes that showed a death or two, but never was the horror ever at the focus of the story.  (This may have worked if the picture had anything else going for it, such as a storyline, but sadly such amenities are absent from this stinker.)  I am shocked at the poorness of this movie, and I walked out asking myself something that years of exposure to the supposed decay of society, American pop culture, had never caused me to wonder: ""Is nothing sacred anymore?""",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
A movie which connects on all levels! Benigni's masterpiece,"As the title suggests,the movie beautifully portrays the struggle of Guido (Roberto Benigni) to protect his son Giosue (Giorgio Cantarini) in the WWII Italy. Roberto Benigni escalates his funny man stature to a different level with his romance in beginning with Dora (Nicoletta Braschi, Benigni's real-life wife) which makes you laugh your heart out and then he maintains this through out the movie even when his life is at stake to convince his son it's all right and they're playing a game which is very touching and almost makes you cry (And you do at the end).Technically, the film is very well scripted and directed by Benigni himself which garnered him an Oscar nomination for direction which was very well deserved as the sequences of romance and between Giosue and Dora came out very well and Benigni's makeover as a courageous father hellbent on protecting his son and using his sense of humor as a weapon to protect and comfort him is brilliant, it's no Schindler's list but it connects with the audience in it's unique tragicomcical script which leads you to believe there is a hope under those horrific circumstances, the movie is no satire but has a charade of comedy to underlying harsh reality which leaves the audience touched at the end.Overall one the best movies on holocaust and Robert Benigni's masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

"A true auteur piece...Of course, that doesn't make it a good film","General views of film expressed herein.  No specific plot points are discussed.I respect that Mr. Benigni got his film made the way that he wanted.  A true auteur piece in having secured financing for this film that he wrote, directed and stared in.  Of course, that doesn't make it a good film. Frankly, I have little respect for LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL and all the attention that it received. The only entertaining thing to come out of this film for me was Ray Romano (I think) on SNL doing a take off of Roberto Benigni at the Academy Awards.  I think that he accurately portrayed him as the annoying starved for attention court jester that he is.If I were Nicoletta Braschi's Dora in LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL I would have had Roberto Benigni's Guido arrested and a restraining order placed against him early on in the story.  His character goes on the top of my list of bothersome people portraying even more irritating characters. It is mind-boggling that American audiences embraced this actor that they had so clearly rejected five years prior in THE SON OF THE PINK PANTHER that featured Benigni as the same yuck-it-up persona (albeit with a French accent).A great Italian film with a lovable child character (that also plays very well to American audiences) is CINEMA PARADISIO.  SCHELIEDLER'S LIST is a ""wholly unforgettable"" movie about the ""triumph of the human spirit in the wake of the Holocaust.""  A real life story of a war torn family is the incredible and ironic EUROPA, EUROPA (HITLERJUNGE SALOMON).  It's the story of a Jewish boy separated from his family and taken in by Germans only to become a Nazi youth.  Comedy is clearly an element that CAN be included in stories of human drama; the 1962 Czech film THE SHOP ON MAIN STREET (OBCHOD NA KORZE) is a thoughtful film that succeeds in every way that Benigni's LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL fails.  LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL is along the lines of TV's Hogan's Heroes but much less entertaining.If you ever had any doubts about what went on in Nazi Concentration Camps, the French documentary NIGHT AND FOG (NUIT ET BROUILLARD) will shock you back to reality. The images of dead humans stockpiled and bulldozed into a ditches should give you something to think about after you get past the sight of human skin hides being used for Nazi lampshades.  Whoever said reality is much scary than fiction wasn't kidding. This infamous film from 1955 shot on the site of Auschwitz is only 30 minutes long, but it is the LONGEST half hour of film you will ever see.  Those who want to rewrite or white wash Holocaust history are clearly deluded in the face of reality.While the financial success of LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL did NOT spawn a rush a Holocaust inspired comedies, there was at least one film that must have been helped by its success.  JAKOB THE LIAR is a Robin Williams vanity piece; an Americanized remake of the Academy Award nominated East German film and well regarded book of the same title.  It is a film that ultimately fails in the same way LIFE does with the caveat that Williams' performance is surprisingly restrained.The success of LIFE did get Benigni the backing he needed to make his next tour de force, a live action version of PINOCCHIO. The film turned out to be Italy's most expensive film ever made but was a major flop in the US.  Benigni's popularity has, for the most part, since faded out of the American consciousness.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

It's an inspiring, clever way to depict the events of the Holocaust, without feeling overly cynical or insulting.  That in itself was quite a triumph.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"A truly beautiful fable, no more, no less.","Life is Beautiful is the first movie in years to make me cry, and the first ever that I freely admit.  In addition to it's powerful story, there are hardly any artistic flaws to be found.  Benigni's slapstick feels like homage to others, but his personal charisma (and sheer cuteness) inject it with new life.  The cinematography is excellent, the site gags all work, and even the youngest member of the primary cast was a believable actor.  The story itself?  There are no words for how powerful, even life changing it is.  Pulling you in all directions at once, crushing beauty with atrocity and then injecting joy into the most despairing of conditions, the film manages to raise so many genuine emotions and leave viewers haunted with it's message.And yet, there are legitimate questions raised by it's detractors, who often feel as if the merit of the story is lost by presenting what could be viewed as a too sanitized version of the Holocaust.  As is said in the beginning of the film, the story is a fable, and I view it much as I did the play _The Crucible_.  In _Crucible_, many details of the events in Salem were changed, many to make the tale easier for modern audiences to understand and accept, without being so shocked that more subtle intent is lost.  Though it makes it less respectable as history retold, it does not take away from the powerful moral to be gained. Similarly, in leaving the true horrors of the concentration camps to our imaginations, Life is Beautiful allows us to become involved more strongly with the moral tale and subtle feelings invoked by individual characters and events without bludgeoning us with sheer horror and revulsion.  Holocaust history does demand the most respect of any historic tragedy, and perhaps too much is assumed of the audience's knowledge, but by focusing on a single idealized story this film can influence the heart in ways that the incomprehensible magnitude and surreal horror of the Holocaust often cannot when presented as numbers in a textbook or even the anonymous agony on newsreel.  Personally, I found it to evoke greater revulsion towards the relatively smaller losses and understated horrors then many other likeminded films do towards more accurate portrayals of great atrocity.While not a perfect film, Life is Beautiful is easily one of the best and most powerful ever made when viewed in the proper light, and above all else, its moral shines as a important reminder of how precious- not to mention beautiful, life is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"If you go to the cinema once a year, this is certainly the film to see this year! Simply UNMISSABLE!","Doesn't it feel good to be treated by European cinema with delicacies like this? What an absolute pleasure such films fill your soul with, it feels so nice not to have been cheated by producers who promise heavenly films and deliver nonsense.Benigni is not new in cinema and filming, having directed and written before (e.g. Il Piccolo diavolo (1988) aka The Little Devil (1988)), but it is mainly his comedy he is known of, his characters being utterly silly (on purpose ?) but always satirical and extreme, outspoken and laughable, as well as lovable. Just recall the taxi-driver in Rome in Jim Jarmusch's Night on Earth (1991) or The Little Devil (1988) himself.Yet Benigni never managed to overcome the superficial comedy, the lighthearted one, which was keeping him in the general entertainer level, a kind of clown for the masses. In this rhapsody to life though he steps far ahead, he becomes the advocate of happiness, simplicity, love. He radiates his Italian/Mediterranean spirit of loudly spoken, open-hearted, joyful mood, even in his miserable times he has his own unique way to deliver an open smile.Benigni chose to work on a tough subject, the holocaust, but his intention is not to present his version of the subject, produce another Schindler's List. The holocaust is only his vehicle to express his anti-racist, anti-fascist ideas and bind them up in an all-loving manifesto on enjoying life no matter how it comes. His story starts when his character Guido tries the urbanised way of living in a late 1930's Italian town affected by the rise in popularity of the fascist ideas. Guido remains unaffected by the dark signs and worries not, always finding a way to make things seem funny, satirising every aspect of a strict and collapsing state and public life. He falls in love with the school teacher Dora (Nicoletta Braschi, Benigni's real life wife, who has worked with him in almost all his other films), whose heart he wins through a series of hilarious incidents. The camera meets them again after a few years, married and with a son. They get sent to a concentration camp, but Guido will find again a way to make things seem glad to his little boy's eyes.It's pointless for me to go through the nominations and awards the film has earned (and is going to earn !!!), look at the imdb's website for this. Still, it is the audience which gives the credits to the film, and it was a nice feeling for me to see so content faces when the lights turned on in the theatre I saw the film. Some might accuse Benigni of dealing with a sorrowing matter in a light way. But if you ask me, unlike Spielberg and other directors who narrated stories about the holocaust, Benigni succeeded exorcising it without putting even a single brutality on celluloid, merely telling his audience that life is what you experience and every single one of us has a different perception of reality. If you go to the cinema once a year, this is certainly the film to see this year! Simply UNMISSABLE! It deserves a 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

I hated the Chaplin movie, ""The Great Dictator,"" for the same reason.But that's not the only problem here. The distortion of reality presented in this movie is abominable. Concentration camps were not sleepaway camps where you could just hide your kids in safety if you were clever enough. I really don't want to go into the horrific details of what concentration camps were really like; I don't think that is appropriate in this forum.Even if it were possible to keep your child hidden away in a camp, I question the legitimacy of making an obviously murderous regime into a silly game of ""points"" to win a tank, just to shield your child from the cruel truth. I am sure that any child in a concentration camp (who would have survived, which was virtually impossible) would have been all too aware of what was really happening. I see the hero's attempt at shielding his child as lying, plain and simple.The thinly-veiled insult contained in this movie is: if only all those poor victims of the Holocaust had only had a sense of humor! Then of course many wouldn't have died, and there would have been so much less suffering.

Funny and Moving!,"""Life Is Beautiful"" is not a holocaust movie, although it has some striking scenes that show the precariousness of the camps, it's a movie about how far a person would go to save his own son.The first half of the movie looks like it's made by Chaplin, it's incredibly funny, and shows how brainy the main character is (Watching his plans to ""surprisingly"" meet Dora are priceless). And it's also a love story, and not a bad one. It's hard to find directors that are competent in doing comedy and drama very well, usually they make a good drama, but not so good comedy, or the contrary, but Benigni deserves to be compared to Chaplin in this one, he made me laugh and cry, and there was almost no break between these two emotions.The second half is more about the father/son relationship. What that man went through to protect his son is one of the most beautiful stories i've ever seeing. But all those sad moments merged between funny ones. Benigni's performance is amazingly funny and moving, but what really surprised me about the acting was Giorgio Cantarini as GiosuÃ©, I'm not saying he was better than Benigni, but for a kid to make such a big difference in the cast of a movie is rare to see.Verdict: Funny and moving, this is a masterpiece as good , if not better, than Chaplin's ""The Great Dictator"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

"Touching, beautiful.","This little anecdote well describes the film.I hate crying. I never cry on principle. I wouldn't cry if my old neighbour was run over while crossing the road or my boss had a heart attack. If my next door shop ran out of my favourite sweets, or if Clinton declared World War III, I wouldn't cry.But I was in tears after watching Life is Beautiful. The only thing I could think of was how stupid I would look when the lights would be on. But when the lights went on, I saw a panorama of white tissues wiping off the tears of the desperate spectators. We were all crying like babies. Kids, daddies and grannies, they all seemed about to commit suicide.Life is Beautiful is a universal movie, able to move anybody's heart. And this is because it's a love-story between a father and his child, it's an emotional journey through the atrocities of the Holocaust, it's a ray of joy and hope that fights against human wickedness.The plot is basic: an Italian-Jewish family is deported to a labour camp during World War II. Here, all sorts of atrocities happen. The extraordinary thing about the film, that makes it different from Schindler's List, for instance, is that these atrocities never really affect the child. His father, played by director and Oscar winner Roberto Benigni, tries in every way to prevent his son from realizing the truth. He in fact tells him that the camp is like a big playground and that they both have to work hard to get points in order to win a big tank. The child, so deluded, can somehow bear the painful situation.The film is not a description of the Holocaust. Rather, it's the experience of the Holocaust seen through the eyes of a child who thinks it's all a game. The movie is not disrespectful towards Jews or the Holocaust, it is, on the contrary, all pervaded with sentiment and compassion. It's the tragedy of two human beings that are dying and still manage to keep their hopes and dreams alive.Life is Beautiful is a film that makes you cry as well as makes you smile. And laugh. The energy of the two protagonists coincides with their capacity to fight, to see a reason to live, a reason to laugh, to have a moment of carefree joy, despite the labour, despite the menace of death, despite the inevitability.Three Oscars won for Best Foreign Film, Best Actor and Best Original Score.

An interesting movie about a complicated subject,"I think I must be in the very small majority of people that neither loved nor hated this movie. In many ways it was skillfully made and well acted. However, the first half of the movie felt like a wacky romantic comedy with an Italian slant. The second half of the movie, however, is set in (of all places) a Nazi death camp. I happen to believe that if you're going to set a movie in the midst of one of the most terrible parts of history, you want to have something say and to do it very carefully. This movie fails in this, I feel. The message of the movie is very trite: ""The human spirit can triumph over any adversity"" might be a good summary. Rather than being uplifting, though, I found the implausible caperings of Guido and the credulity of his son to be ghoulish and disturbing in a way I doubt was intended by the filmmakers. I'm afraid I can't go along with the premise that the horror of Auschwitz could be covered up with some clever lies and a silly walk.However, I must stress that the movie is artfully made and contains some memorable scenes. The mountain of corpses in the mist was almost as creepy as Guido's final conversation with his friend, the good Doktor Lessing.La Vite e Bella is certainly worth a look; it is, however, neither profound nor historically valuable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Think again,"(SPOILERS ahead!)""It's not supposed to be realistic! We already know how horrible the Holocaust was.""The above is a direct quote from another user comment. I beg to differ (what, so now we're going to show how hilarious and heartwarming it is?). No movie, or the sum of every documentary, reel of footage, essay, book, novel, etc. could possibly convey the horror of the Holocaust.The first half was moderately amusing, but I was moved neither to laughter or tears by any moment (and in retrospect the first half seems to have been calculated to engender goodwill for the second) in the film. I wanted to be affected by it, and fully expected to appreciate it, in no small part because it came highly recommended to me by a very good friend whose taste usually coincides with mine. But I cannot chalk this film up as a mere disappointment.The dramatist who attempts to muck around with the details of the Holocaust fights a particularly uphill battle, given how acquainted we are with it and its magnitude both in numbers and scope. That said, I have no qualms with dramatic license, provided that it is employed consciously and conscientiously. But ""Life Is Beautiful"" is not only unsuccessful but willfully negligent in these respects. (For starters, during WWII Italian Jews remained in Italy...)Factual errors could be ignored had the film been set in a more surreal or fanciful context, but it isn't; details are handled in a slipshod fashion when they're handled at all. And so I couldn't ignore my incredulity at the 'hiding' of the child, that not a single inmate spoke German, etc. ad nauseam.Many times have I heard the protest ""I could never watch 'Schindler's List', I couldn't bear it."" And I respect that. But in the next breath, the same person will often be heard singing the praises of this movie, and that to me is disturbing. The portrayal of the camp conditions alone amounts to a sugarcoating of the Holocaust, making it easier for the viewer to watch; perhaps it SHOULD be difficult, don't you think?But not in Benigni's version- his character even dies off-screen. By pulling its punches, the film is neither as sad nor as funny as it wants to be.The 'hope' offered up in ""Life Is Beautiful"" is really just of the standard Hollywood variety, will and imagination triumphing despite the most dire of circumstances. I don't have a problem with such sentiment, I just want a movie to *earn* it, and like so many popcorn pictures, ""Life Is Beautiful"" doesn't succeed, despite its unlikely setting. My suspicion is that if the film had originated in Tinseltown, critics would not have been so kind and audiences not nearly so enraptured. You gotta hand it to Benigni, the conceit of the movie is a great ploy and he's got some chutzpah for even attempting it.Could redemption be found in the midst of such atrocities and suffering? I believe so, but the kind suggested in ""Life Is Beautiful"" is false and fleeting, evaporating as soon as the kid stops fawning over the tank and wonders ""Where's dad?"" (Some have proposed that this makes the film an absurdist masterpiece, but any irony is far from intended- hence the bland, affirming title, the smiling faces on the posters, and the sunny first half.) A father's sacrificial love makes for a more-than-worthy premise for a film, but it is taken to shallow lengths here.Perhaps this wouldn't be so damaging if Benigni had not decided to co-opt for his movie what is arguably the most despicable and well-documented event in human history. The examination and implications of an event like the Holocaust should never cease, but I don't hold out much hope for our ability to avoid more like it, not if ""Life Is Beautiful"" and the overall reaction to it is indicative of our ability to prevent such monstrosities just by force of historical memory. How quickly we forget.(There were two things about the movie I liked: the transition in the greenhouse, and the relationship between Guido and his hoped-for, riddling savior.)I am impressed by Mr. Benigni's irrepressible optimism- impressed and annoyed, frankly -but he can't get by on charm this time.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Don't leave on the first hour!,"For me, the movie is divided in two parts, the first is a little silly (when R. Begnini meets Dora), some non - sense situations, but since he and Dora have a son, what happens next it's really really good, it's impossible not involving with the plot since that moment. The performance of the R.Begnini and the child can't be better. Dora is great too, except for the situation of the car when R.Begnini surprises her in her boyfriend's car, her expression is very poor, except for that, her performance is excellent. The character of R. Begnini is a smart man who does everything for the people he loves.

An un-even but charming mess...,"I can't figure out the fascination with this highly overrated film. The first hour is delightful, then we are asked to believe some quite outlandish behavior in the concentration camps. Would ""Guido"" really risk his life to play a song on the PA system? It doesn't make sense to take this risk, in light of his efforts to save his son (which also fall short of believability.) I often am able to suspend my logic in favor of a romantic choice by a character. It is, after all, the movies. But is doesn't even work on that level, since so much time is dedicated to his single vision: save the boy from death or reality! There is no fear of the camp or even death in the film. So, Benigni's character's actions don't have a base in reality. Thus, we cannot feel compassion for the moment, even if we understand that we should feel it. It's the fault of the script and the director, who don't recognize that most of the audience would like the lead to be BOTH smart and charming, to be BOTH brave and funny, to be BOTH egocentric and understanding of others. Benigni's character comes off as a silly goof who doesn't see the poignancy of his own dilemma...so the movie-goer may miss it as well.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Innocence and Courage!!,"Innocence and courage, sometimes that's what you need to get through some hard times, more importantly, get the one you love through, have a shoulder for them when they need it. It's about love and family.It's the story of a father who uses his humor and his son's innocence to help him get through the Jewish Holocaust. He makes his son believe that it is all part of a game and the winner wins a tank.The first half of the film is actually a rom-com set in the politically strained environment of Italy. Whereas, the second half is set in the concentration camp where Guido tries to protect his son.Critics argue that the film handles a delicate subject matter in a comedic and carefree manner and it might offend a group of people. But it should be understood that that is actually the purpose of the film. What the character of Guido does is present the whole concentration camp as a part of a game to his son, and the viewer. If the actual holocaust was show, it would defy the purpose of the film and take away its innocence. We have Schindler's List for people who want to witness the actual holocaust. This is a different film. It is supposed to depict family love at its best. The film is about optimism and hope.The film being comedic, which manages to bring a smile every now and then, is depressing all of the same. Not only Benigni delivers a superb performance, he has directed it just as well. Barring the occasional goofs by the supporting cast here and there, it's the story that ill stay for you for a long time. The film is perfectly blended with just the right score and beautiful use of ""Belle nuit, Ã´ nuit d'amour"".Direction: Strong self direction, might be a little flawed at places but great nevertheless.Screenplay/Story: Extremely good. It handles the controversial and delicate subject matter with utmost ease and delicacy. Strong character development, creates a character that stays with you. Even better executed.Acting: A deserving Oscar for Roberto Benigni. Giorgio Cantarini had the innate innocence required for the character. Rest if the cast was fitting.Music: 'Perfection in simplicity' is the most fitting phrase to describe the subtle score by Nicola Piovani.All in all, a film that stays. A film that can effect you if not change you. A film to be enjoyed with the family.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Count Me Out,"I am in the minority on this one, given the current 8.6 rating and its ranking at #26 all-time (!), but I have two major issues with ""Life is Beautiful"" that hold me back from joining others and proclaiming it a classic.Plot in a nutshell: A cartoonish man in WWII Italy wins the heart of a local beauty (after much effort). Years later he is sent to a 'death camp' where he tries to shield his young son from the horrors that surely await them both.Issue #1: Maybe it's just me, but isn't Roberto Benigni's character Guido highly annoying? Let's recap - early in the film, we see him - uninvited - creepily and unnecessarily sucking on the leg of a woman he doesn't know (to extract 'wasp poison' he says); he is constantly trying to steal another man's hat (because it's better than his, apparently); he steals the school inspector's ribbon and then impersonates him at the local elementary school, where (because he doesn't know what to say when he's asked to give a speech) he strips down to his underwear in front of the children....need I go on? To put it bluntly, Guido is NOT an endearing character, at all. He is a bit of a creep and a petty thief and he talks too much, with nothing near the charm of Chaplin's ""Tramp,"" to whom he's been compared here by some. I don't get it. I was immediately turned off by his antics and never was able to warm up to him as the film wore on.Issue #2: The scenes in the death camp can only be described as fantasy. In fact, the entire film should be labeled as fantasy, because what we are shown is so far removed from reality it can't be categorized as anything else. Maybe I would have embraced it more had I known this going in, but I did not. Example: 
 one of the early camp scenes, where Guido gets a hold of the camp loudspeaker and broadcasts a message to his wife, and somehow is not caught or punished for this? In reality he would have been shot ON THE SPOT and that would have been the end of this film. There are numerous similar instances of completely unrealistic and imaginary situations in the camp to move the plot along......yet we are supposed to become immersed in what is going on, knowing full well none of it could have possibly happened this way? Yeah I just can't do that.Having said all of this, you CAN sense the connection father and son have, it's palpable, it's real. And you want to believe that the father would indeed try anything to save his family, up to and including sacrificing himself if he has to. The film does convey that quite effectively, and because of that, it has some merit. I just don't find it to be 'one of the greatest films ever' like many other people seemingly do. In essence it's a feel-good fantasy set in one of the worst imaginable nightmares of human history. In direct opposition to the feeling of this film, and a much more accurate representation of how the camps affected the people interned in them, I'll provide a quote from Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel's book ""Night"": ""Here there are no fathers, no brothers, no friends. Everyone lives and dies for himself alone.""6/10. Light-hearted tale of survival set in a place where hope for most people had long since disappeared. Would I watch again?

Life is beautiful as to make it smart as everything depends on your attitude.,"""Life is beautiful"",is a film about that brief period of Nazi rule in Italy due to which many ordinary Jewish people had to endure enormous hardships.Although it is a film about Nazism,it is quite different from other films of the Nazi film genre like Schindler's list.It is more of a film about comic romance,laughter,optimism and how to keep one's sanity intact when one finds oneself in a difficult close to death kind of situation. This film ran into trouble as many leading filmmakers protested against what they called ""making mockery of a serious issue like holocaust"".According to Godard it is hard to believe that life could have been beautiful for anyone in a concentration camp.Life is beautiful is divided into 3 parts:carefree life,period of hardships and a harmless game with a kid.Roberto Benigni and his wife excel in all these parts.It is the star kid Giorgio Cantarini who shines in the last part.In a way,it can be said that the film succeeds because of his innocent behavior with which he carries himself through his entire stay with his father.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
The Most Optimistic Movie of All Time,"On the Valentine Day I had decided firmly to watch this movie and I realized that nothing could prepare me for what I was about to experience even though I knew beforehand that this Roberto Benigni's magnificent creation which was held high by the critics was nominated for the Best Picture along with the much expected and truly great Saving Private Ryan.(The fact that neither of them won as the Best Picture is as disappointing as the fact that Denzel Washington didn't win the Best Leading Actor at the 72nd Academy Awards.Also Raging Bull should have undoubtedly won at 53rd Academy Awards as the Best Picture along with the Best Director.But then this are my PERSONAL opinions and are hinted at NO ONE in particular.) As far this movie is concerned Roberto Benigni has done a great job as the director and as well as an actor. This is the movie where we find out that under circumstance of crisis an ordinary being like Orifice can get transformed into a Godly being in order to protect his loved ones.(Here, the wife and the son.) Its in this movie that one learns the importance of will power.(Remember the 'hat-exchange' scene? Or the 'dog near the box' scene? Or the scene in which a real,true tank arrives which the son considers to be his first prize?) This is the movie where one learns that its us who should be in control of our emotions and not vice versa.(Remember the scene where Orifice is carried away for execution? Watch his facial expressions and the way he walks in order to mask his sadness and fear in front of his son.) Its in this movie that one learns the great principle of OPTIMISM.(Remember all the scenes where Orifice keeps telling his son that they are playing a game where they have to score bonus marks and if he expresses even his desire for food(hunger) there will be substraction of marks?They were actually suffering extreme conditions in the concentration camp for being a Jew.) Even though I usually don't prefer to give ranks to my Personal choice of 25 Movies of All Time, this is an exception and this movie gets the Rank One.

This works for me but I can understand why someone would dislike it,"Comedies that use Nazism, WWII and/or the Holocaust as fodder exist in a surprisingly large number. Like how many times has someone made the weird pitch about it being a comedy dealing with Nazis? Apart from this-just from memory-you have JoJo Rabbit, The Great Dictator and various segments in Mel Brooks films (Brooks famously hates this film). Of the ones I have seen I think this one is the best. It somehow manages to be gut-wrenching, honest and hopeful. And funny.I think the keys to the film are two. First the opening, and closing, narration position the film as a fable; the film is meant to be taken on the subtextual or allegorical level. This smooths out the issues over taste as undermines the literalness of the narrative . Second the film, in context correct ways, isn't shy about the actual damaged and human of the Holocaust. The abject horror is mostly confined to 3 sequences-Guido's fate, the fog and the showers-but each are blunt, striking. Guido's fate especially emphasizes the statistical unlikelihood of surviving. (Weirdly, I think the film handles to aspect better than Schindler's List).Add in that the film takes the time to show certain Nazis being Nazis because of a callous indifference not merely foaming at the mouth antisemitism and there is a poignancy to the film that rarely gets put into WWII cinema.This film strikes me as polarizing given its central conceit.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Holocaust meets comedy and someone who can pull it off,"Question: Is there any conceivable way at all to combine the holocaust with comedy and get laughs out of it? Well, not really I'd say, not without completely sacrificing the unspeakable horrors the concept of organized mass murder stands for. One shouldn't even try. If you look closer at Roberto Benigni's ""Life is Beautiful"" you will see that such an attempt isn't actually made either in this film. It's not about ridiculing Nazis, confronting them with their own absurdities or pretend to go along with their ideas to make the underlying idiocy apparent. This is just a means. Rather the film creates a parallel, carefree world alongside the horrific reality of the Nazis, which is upheld by the central character Guido (played by Benigni himself), a clown at heart. All this in order to keep up the illusion of a perfect world for his son GiosuÃ© in the face of impending doom. ""Ah, the train ride was no good,"" the father admits to his son when they arrive at the concentration camp. ""When we go back we take the bus. I'll tell them!"" And when young GiosuÃ© wants to quit what Guido has convinced him to be just a game, his father is the first one to head out: ""We're in the lead now, but well, we won't get the big prize then. Too bad."" And suddenly GiosuÃ© reconsiders.Roberto Benigni undoubtedly is a brilliant comedian. He's unforgettable e.g. in Jim Jarmusch's ""Night on Earth"" as a crazy cab driver to name just one example, but unfortunately his talent is often wasted in various light comedies. Great opportunities arise rarely for comedians, but Benigni grabbed this one and put all his heart into it, as director and actor. Contrasting his slapstick humor with the stark, painful reality of the Nazi's final solution to the Jew problem is daring, risky and extremely difficult to pull off.

In Any Language a Masterpiece,"Roberto Benigni's ""Life Is Beautiful"" is a near perfect film.  The first half is pure comedy while the last is heart-wrenching drama at its grittiest.  Somehow Benigni makes it work with a well-deserved Oscar-winning performance for Best Actor.  The supporting cast is superb, along with nearly every other aspect of the film.  It is one of the Best Foreign Language Films I've ever seen and one of the best films I've ever seen period.  Easily 5 stars out of a possible 5.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"Life is Beautiful earnestly embeds optimism in the darkest of moments, but with minimal emotional impact.","La vita Ã¨ bella. Benigni's audacious dramatic comedy that substitutes the frequently utilised depressing perspective of the Holocaust for a well-intentioned lighter tone. As with most revered classics, my initial approach is one filled with trepidation. The thought of my opinion being placed in the minority forces me to produce a defensive essay rather than a balanced review, at the possibility of being attacked. Unfortunately for Benigni, I disliked an entire half of his ""masterful"" feature, and was left perplexed as to how it crumbled into emotional manipulation for the sake of entertainment. A Jewish waiter finds the love of his life and starts a new family with her, only for their happiness to be abruptly interrupted when they are taken to a concentration camp.To make light of such a horrific period of time is a brave decision. The cynics will view it as a piece of hyperbolic propaganda with pivotal moments of history being re-written in order to drain audiences of their happiness. Others will analyse this drama and overtly praise its unique perspective for accessibility, offering an obvious thematic premise, that being the retaining of optimism during times when humanity has exceeded a certain level of darkness. However theorising a concept and actually realising it are two very different hurdles. Just as different as the two halves that narratively create this feature.The first and more superior half, is a romantic comedy that relishes in conveying a whimsical aesthetic for the fantastical injection of genuine character development that will instantly grant a smile to every viewer. Benigni's visual flair, reminiscent that of the legendary Charlie Chaplin, provides irreverent slapstick humour that suits the hyperactive performance that he infamously portrayed, instantly making him utterly adorable. Whether it be Guido accidentally storing eggs in his hat (a recipe for disaster if you ask me...) or bumbling around as a waiter. His contagious personality is enough to shine an optimistic light in the darkest of corridors, and that's partly due to the screenplay. A noteworthy series of events, once Guido picks up Dora from the opera theatre, that leads his character into a serendipitously magical direction, is a prime example of writing that emitted a loveable quality. The combination of the script with Benigni's performance, and his solid direction for the first half, had me laughing out loud on multiple occasions. With a glisten in my eye in the hope that this would be a new masterpiece. Sadly, not to be.After a masterfully edited transition that sees us jump forward two/three years, our characters are now in the midst of the Holocaust. Jewish civilians are subjugated to poor treatment before being rallied up and transported to concentration camps. Yet Benigni maintains his level of comedy during this period of time, for the sake of his adolescent son who knows no different. As well-intentioned and delicately crafted as this tone was, it came across as highly insensitive and deceitfully manipulative. Various scenes, in particular the German translation segment, had me sink into my seat with a level of uncomfortableness. It didn't sit right with me in the slightest. The emotional connection with these characters dissipated instantly as soon as they were pushed onto the train, and that's mostly due to Benigni's insistence in conveying an overly ambitious optimistic perspective.The more poignant moments of devastation unfazed me due to the bombastic buffoonery that felt misguided. The heartfelt character development that preceded the second half diminished to establish the scattershot exploration of concentration camp regime. And then, as soon as the supposed ""gut punch"" occurs, it's instantly forgotten about when an American tank arrives to save the day (historically incorrect by the way). It concludes on an appropriate quote regarding life and sacrifice, but at that point it's a little too late when all emotional investment is still lingering around in Italy. Atleast Piovani's score is consistently amazing throughout, capturing that Italian Renaissance aura.It is regretful that I end this review with a shade of disappointment. Whilst technically astute and harnessing a heart of gold, the jarring second half emerges as exploitative rather than entertainment. A dire shame considering how wholesome the first half was. But praise must be given to Benigni for ambitiously conveying a wave of optimism, his personality certainly is infectious. I mean just look at that Academy Awards speech!",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

That would have been a fitting alternative for salvation through the good doctor.All in all a touching story done with great style and humor. The acting being superb by all in the cast.

Magnificent!,"Contains some detailed informationRoberto Benigni definitely grabs attention in the late 1990s Italian film, `La Vita Ã¨ bella,' known in English as `Life is Beautiful.'  In addition to directing and writing, Benigni is the main star of the film.The film can be said to be composed of two main parts-the first is pure comedy to the point of absurdity, and the second is dead serious with a touch of comedy.  At first, the comedy that Benigni uses seems as if he is trying to showcase his own talents.  But the comedy is put to good use during the second half of the film as Benigni, who plays Guido Orefice, must use comedy and imagination to protect his son, Joshua, from the horrors of being confined in a Nazi concentration camp.  The two parts of the film also highlight two different time periods-the first part takes place in the 1930s, while the second part occurs around 1945. Although hints of anti-Jewish sentiment appear in the first part of the film, the majority of the first part is focused on living life in a spontaneous way.  For example, at the very beginning of the film, Guido finds himself in a car without breaks, flying through the countryside until the car goes off the side of the road near a small farm.  While at the farm, a lady falls out of the barn on top of him, to which he replies, `What kind of place is this? It's beautiful: Pigeons fly, women fall from the sky! I'm moving here!'  During the rest of the first half of the movie, Guido keeps running into `Principessa,' the name he gives Dora (Nicoletta Braschi). Many of the `unexpected' meetings between the two are planned by Guido. Some film critics love `Life is Beautiful' while others are disappointed or even offended by the film.  Roger Ebert is a good example of a critic who enjoyed the film: '`Life Is Beautiful' is not about Nazis and Fascists, but about the human spirit.  It is about rescuing whatever is good and hopeful from the wreckage of dreams.  About hope for the future.  About the necessary human conviction, or delusion, that things will be better for our children than they are right now.'  I give this movie a 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Very humanistic and different approach to the Holocaust,"I thought the film was wonderful, although at times it was difficult to sit through.  I didn't know whether to laugh or to cry.  Most  of the times I cringed.  Most people were offended by the film's approach to the holocaust. Now that we look back on that time...... it is understandable that we are horrified.   But, how did the people really cope at that time?  How did they make it through day in and  day out. I think that the film vividly shows us the spirit of the human soul. And yes, at times it is our imagination, which includes humor that helps us make it through.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
a quaking wreck of a movie: humor,"I saw this movie although I had a strong sense beforehand that it was drastically misguided, after seeing it, I realized that it was far worse than I could have imagined. Roberto Benigni in his benighted way, probably thinks what he did here was heroic, I can excuse poor judgement and taste in an artist, but for the life of me, I cannot fathom how anything so misbegotten could be so popular and somewhat critically acclaimed. Certainly, there are true stories of incredible bravery, fortitude and even humor in the face of such unrelenting evil, but these are true stories (like the escape from Sobibor).  Benigni, however, creates, out of whole cloth, as far as I can tell, a fairy tale which uses the Holocaust as background.  He creates a character and situations that could simply not exist under such conditions and are not even remotely related to anyone or anything in the history of the holocaust.  To further compound the problem, he constructs Aushwitz-lite in which the latter half of the movie takes place.  A place with gas chambers, unrelenting, (but Chaplin-esque) hard labor, and with such seemingly lax security that Benigni's character can commandeer the camp's PA system, and effectively hide his son.  Further, the inmates, who in reality, were starved and worked to death never appeared more than ""bushed.""  These fictional liberties, to my mind, are unforgiveable. The Holocaust is always foreground, and there is no ""lite"" available.  The Germans simply killed you, unrelentingly, for any reason whatsoever. Further, one of the worst aspects of arrival at a death camp like Aushwitz was the sudden separation (culling) of the children from the parents, husbands from wives.  This activity, never overlooked, immediately told the prisoners they had passed from the land of the living into hell.  Somehow this little fact was passed over by Benigni.  He simply keeps his son with him.  Indeed, none of the playful little camp activities portrayed could have ever existed for even a milli-second.   Benigni's story could have taken place in any particular bad situation, why set it in a concentration camp.  Perhaps my reaction seems humorless, but really, the humor here is strained and out of place.  What was he thinking? Evil triumphed, millions were dispatched in the most monstrous of conditions.  Nothing can modify this, the pure fact of its occurrence makes interpretation, let alone heart warming entertainment an impossibility.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"Good, but overrated","Life is Beautiful is a good movie, I just can't understand its increadable high praise by people. The first part of the movie, dealing with coming of love between the couple, was fairly delightful, even if it being kind of corny. The second half is not worse than the first, but not really better than it either. Benini's character convinces his son that their just in a game when their actually in a concentration camp. That worked for a little bit but after a while it got kind of sappy. You keep wondering if it's actually going to do more harm to the kid than good.The movie has it's funny moments, and it's warm hearted moments, but I really can't call it a great movie.

"Wake up, people!","A nasty little bit of Holocaust revisionism, one wonders whether anyone who liked this film actually thought about it.

The film trivializes the deaths of 6 million, while letting everyone else breath a little easier for not having to face, even at the big screen's remove, the completely dehumanizing horror that was Hitler's death machine.

A number of people that I talked to didn't even remember the scene where Benigni and his sleeping son happened upon the hill of bodies through what was thought to be fog, which turned out to be smoke from the furnaces.

"Many of Life's Lessons can be learned from this film, Life is Beautiful","Author Viktor E Frankl would have loved this film. His book ""Man's Search for Meaning"" (at least the second half of his book) came to life in Guido's character (Roberto Benigni). The film's segment in a concentration camp actualizes what Frankl attributes to his own survival in a Nazi concentration camp, i.e. his own choosing of the way that things affected him, rather than letting the Nazi's dictate that choice for him. What Guido (Roberto Benigni) did in the concentration camp is what Frankl would have have advised him to do and Guido did it very well. This strategy proved especially beneficial for his 5 year old son, Giorgio.The film is very upbeat and loving, especially in it's first hour which makes no mention of the holocaust or prison camps. Evenso, the uplifting spirit of Guido continues into the camp, with him continually finding ways to show his love there for his wife and son. He's always looking for ways to make things better, never giving into depression in what was clearly a depressing environment. He certainly made the best of a very bad situation.Frankl's memoir of survival (in the second half of his book) really came to life through Guido in a way that Frankl could never have imagined, but which was done very touchingly, none the less.

A lie for the naive and ignorant.,"Only the naive and ignorant will find this film charming. Those who know anything about the Holocaust will see it for what it is--a lie that desecrates the memory of six million dead.Under the Nazis, six million Jews died for no other reason than that they were Jewish. This invests the fact of their Jewishness with transcendent importance. In ""Life Is Beautiful,"" however, Roberto Benigni's character Guido is Jewish only because the film announces that he is. His Jewishness has no other significance; it is not the affirmation of anything; it is a manipulative plot device. Guido's goodness is not attributed to his being Jewish--that is something to be dispensed with quickly, as if it were an embarrassment.And so Benigni ends up treating the Jews very little differently than the Nazis. For one thing, he shamefully misrepresents the reality of the Nazis' Konzentrationlagers. A Jew would have been murdered for any ONE of the acts of defiance that Guido gets away with. Benigni's film turns the real danger and real violence and real death of the Holocaust into something like a Roadrunner cartoon in which Wile E. Coyote never really suffers or dies. But this is a lie: under the Nazis, the Jews suffered and died. They did not get away with carefree acts of defiance.What is more, the mass of Jews in the camp in which Guido and his son are imprisoned are treated as nothing more than the faceless and nameless background to Benigni's disgusting clowning. They are given no more individuation--no more personhood and uniqueness--than they were by the Nazis themselves.""Life Is Beautiful"" is an obscene exploitation of enormity and sorrow.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Almost beautiful,"Roberto Benigni, the Italian Chaplin, has made, in 'Life is Beautiful', a comedy about the holocaust.  Which first begs the question: is it acceptable to do such a thing?  To which the answer must be ""yes"".  Often the best (and most unsettling) comedy is the blackest, in which the intertwining of the funny and the tragic makes us consider afresh the absurdity of life and death.  And the holocaust, sadly, was horrific precisely because by the fact that it happened it proved that such events do fall within the range of human behaviour. If, in remembering the holocaust, we can only do so with solemnity, we put it in a mausoleum outside of the rest of human experience; and are thereby less, not more, likely to understand and remember.But this leads onto a second question: is it possible to make a comedy about the holocaust (or at any rate a good one)?  Here the sheer scale of the awfulness makes a positive answer harder to give: for such a film to work, the comedy must be commensurate with the tragedy; and this perhaps cannot be done.  An earlier (and brilliant) film of Benigni's, 'Johnny Stecchino', poked fun at gangsters: but even then, it was working with stereotyped gangsters as depicted in movies, not at real murderers extinguishing human life.  With the holocaust, there is no such get outs: few have even dared make straight movies about this subject.The first half of 'Life is Beautiful' is a classic Benigni romp, poking some gentle fun at the less extreme excesses of Italian fascism as it proceeds. It's silly but good, a story of inescapable charm.  But in the second half, the scene moves to somewhere like Auschwicz, and the film becomes more problematic.  The idea (of a man who uses humour to save his son, and himself, from confronting the true horror of his situation) has some merit but is ultimately not sustainable in the face of reality.  So the film has to tone down reality.  Benigni is treated rather better than the average Auschwicz inmate (the film nowhere implies just how low the survival rate was); his fellow prisoners are shown as faceless zombies (distancing us when they do get killed); while when the subject of mass murder is directly addressed, the film inevitably slumps into mawkishness.  There are still some good gags, and occasionally some telling moments (particularly those involving a ""humane"" doctor who Beningi befriends); but overall the setting rings false.  The film might have achieved more poignancy and realism had it been set in a pre-deportation Jewish ghetto: by going all the way to the death camps, it overplays its hand.'Life is Beautiful' is still a funny and original film; but actually less brave than you might at first think.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
a fabulous fable,"many have criticized this movie of its ""unbelievability"" and ""unacceptable"" use of humor in telling a tale set in a Holocaust setting.but, as the beginning lets us know...it is a fable. and it is a beautiful one at that.like all good fables, it has the classic characters: the peasant, the poet, the princess, the wise man, the villain, and the child. like all good fables, it is filled with both joy and sadness. Benigni's concept of making a comedy about the Holocaust was a daring and interesting avenue to explore the courage and hope of the inhabitants of the Nazi concentration camps, one not explored in other excellent Holocaust films like Schindler's List or the Pianist.everything about this movie is great: the acting, the storytelling, cinematography, musical score. the first half is such a great setup for the second half, and the ending...makes me cry just to THINK about it.i love movies as literature and entertainment, but this is one of the few films i have ever seen that actually CHANGED my life after i had seen it. it really made me better appreciate the little joys and subtle beauties of life.if you go into this film expecting a dark and stark realistic portrayal of the Holocaust, you'll probably be let down. that's not what it is. it's a fable. go into it with open mind and open heart and let it sweep you away with its magic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Artful blend of tragedy and comedy is a testimony to the human spirit...,"If someone had told me that a genuinely moving story of a Jewish father and son who end up in a German concentration camp could manage to sustain such an artful blend of humor and tragedy, I wouldn't believe them. Then again, think of the popular success Americans have seen on TV in the shape of the enormously successful comedy HOGAN'S HEROES which takes place in a prison camp. Or the bittersweet irony of Billy Wilder's STALAG 17 with its blend of comedy and drama.But what ROBERTO BENIGNI has accomplished here surpasses all expectations on just how extraordinary this sort of material can be when executed with such wit, wisdom and humor and--even more importantly--without offending anyone with such controversial subject matter.The first part of the film is full of abundant humor as it chronicles the romance of the Jewish man and his sweetheart. Midway the tone of the film shifts to a darker element as the man, his wife and the young son are placed in a concentration camp. The husband is so determined that his son will be shielded from the stark realities around them that he pretends it's all a game. Benigni is a man of such irrepressible spirit that it makes the film's ending even more poignant.He deservedly won the Best Actor Oscar in '97 and the film itself was voted Best Foreign Film. The delightful score by Nicola Piovani won still another Oscar.Summing up: A fable, delightfully written and produced with an unforgettable performance by Roberto Benigni. Who can forget his joy on Oscar night when he bounded over the tops of seats to reach the stage and accept his Oscar?",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

The first act acts as a prologue to the main film. But what follows is an overwhelming and beautiful tale of emotions- tragic and comedy blended into one. Benigni, without making any political statement, gets closer to the situation and makes this fable an utmost believable one. I've never cried so much watching a film before, especially at the end scene which is a redemption and revelation, of sorts, both at the same time had me in tears and when I learned that there are no more scenes ahead, I was left wiping my tears for a really long time.

This isn't a north European ghetto.  This is a beautiful Tuscan mountainside village and Charlie Chaplin is centre stage.  But then the storm troopers arrive.

Great movie,"A middle aged Jewish man has no idea what is coming to his home front. A man by the name of Guido is a friendly, caring guy. Guido arrives in Tuscany with a friend of his and dreams of opening a bookshop. He later gets a job working as a waiter for his uncle at a hotel. As the days go by more and more fascist signals arrive. Even though fascism has clearly arrived he still ignores the signs and finds the love of his life, Dora. He marries her and has a child named, Giosue. Finally the dreadful day comes when their bookshop is vandalized and Guido and his son are taken away. Dora is frightened by this and begs to be taken to by the German radicals and the entire family is sent to a concentration camp. To ease his son, Guido, tells his son that they were taken to play a game and the winner that achieves 1000 points wins a tank. As days go by, young little Giosue's hope evaporates. It is up to Guido to save his family from being a part of the millions of other Jews that had died before them. The book Muse is very similar to this story. Both stories are based off the same time and both tell the story of a family that is captured and put into a concentration camp. Each story has its own way of explaining the struggles of being Jewish and living in Europe during World War two. Muse showed us how they were able to hide in small towns and how they had to run from town to town and in the movie Life is Beautiful it showed the sacrifice and how it was so hard to stay positive. Each story helped show the severity and cruelness of World War two on the Jewish world.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Very good movie but no masterpiece,"I watched this movie these weekend shown in Italian with English subtitles. I'm still trying to decide whether it was worth the several Oscars it won. The storyline is simple. Guido,Dora and their young son Joshua are sent to a concentration camp because they are jewish. Guido tries to make light of what is a very horrific, nightmarish situation by heavily improvising to his young son by using humor that it is all just a game. The young boy that played the son was brilliant in the role-he is VERY talented. I didn't think the harsh reality of the camp was built up enough in this movie. If they would have put more detail into the horrible reality of the camp it would have made the movie better. Overall it was good and enjoyable.

"""Life is Beautiful""","Overall, I loved this motion picture to the fullest extent, especially for one that we would watch educationally in English class. The 1940's holocaust survival theme was truly interesting to watch, as it portrayed an accurate account of an average Jewish family's struggles at that time in history. Much can be related between this movie and the recent book our English class read earlier called ""Maus"" by Art Spiegelman. Both have the same elements of danger and survival amongst family members against the Nazi's. A key factor that also connects the two tales is the bond between father and son. In ""Maus"", the father named Vladek, who is a post P.O.W. is set by his son art to tell the story of the family, this in which Art then creates into an award winning graphic novel. Relatively, in the movie ""Life is Beautiful"" the main character named ""Guido Orefice"" must save his wife and son and himself from the Nazi gas chambers at one of the infamous death camps. His tale of survival is truly courageous and the end products are lessons learned and the proof that a father must do what needs to be done to save his family.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

"The script has some brilliant ideas, but the film is lack of interest, art and even heart","According to some people, Life is Beautiful is one of the best movies of all time, and for some, the best movie of all time, yes, because the movie seems sweet, right? How? There is a family, we watch how the father and the mother meet, oh! how romantic and warm it is. Many people like such things, the meeting stories. Sometimes, it begins with saying in a rainy day... In the first half, we see some superficial slapstick comedy. Comedy is different, tragicomic is different, Life is Beautiful is not tragicomic till the final that shook me a little. It is clearly seen that Benigni inspired from Charlie Chaplin movies, but if you ask me, his film, Life is Beautiful cannot be even ""C"" of Charlie Chaplin movies. People say that the first half is comedy, the second half is tragedy. No. There is nothing devastating or shaking in the movie. Benigni runs after only romance and comedy and little drama, but he does not show anything to us about the conflict or the intensity of the situation. If the story had been told in a different way, with a different mood (tragicomic and serious), it could have been a masterpiece. The idea is brilliant (a father who tries to conceal the (bitter) fact from his little son by saying all this is a game in a concentration camp), but the execution is zero. However, also the movie was excruciatingly boring, I don't know how did it happen, but for me it is the same as Fellini's Otto e Mezzo in terms of lacking interest. The (too heavy?) style including cinematography is lack of effect, lack of cinema feeling, thus the movie is lack of real art and even heart! I couldn't feel anything for the situations of the characters personally and the heartwarming, heartbreaking tone of the film didn't seem me sincere (I mean made for audiences) If you think that I exaggerate too much, please watch The Pianist or Schindler's List again to be sure (both are excellent movies by the way) Roberto Benigni was not the right person for this project I believe. His approach, execution is the same as street theater or child theater which no objection, but for such a story, almost unbearable. Yes, also the movie is not realistic, but it is not important, welcome to this fantasy, an alternative history or an inventive story, but as said, the movie can't carry that great idea.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

"Life is Beautiful, a film made for people in the 90s who wanted to feel like they're in the 40s","The first half will be burdensome if you're not jiving with Benigni's brand of humour, and the overall message is wonky. Still fun though.In truth I am very conflicted on this one. You could sum it up to be: Life is Beautiful, a film made for people in the 90s who wanted to feel like they're in the 40s. You get the sense with this more than other Holocaust movies that the makers of it were far removed from the real-life experience, or at least that's certainly the impression it gives off. The plot and overall unfurling of the story once they reach the camp becomes such a farce in the name of that ""look for optimism everywhere"" message that taking it seriously is a tough ask. It's essentially a fable on the backdrop of a historic tragedy, presenting a theme everyone above the age of 12 would nod along to, it's just...using WW2 as a backdrop for this grand idea. Thinking out loud about this, it's hysterical this film even works at all.I don't gasp and groan at the idea of having a film set in a concentration camp with a lighter breezy tone, not everything has to be Son of Saul. However, it's clear that the dire for already had a reputation for being a comic in Italy prior to this film, and I guess he's fortunate that his style landed well in the States with audiences, because I struggle to imagine any other time period besides 1997 when this lands? Release it twenty years earlier, it plays in front of too many vets who still felt raw when remembering the war, not to mention the elephant in the room being the survivors of the camp. Release it twenty years later, and I don't see it flies by in the twitter critic age where morality is more and more desired in media, and unless I'll missing something patently obvious in the text, it's a bit miraculous Life is Beautiful is still held in such high esteem, social normative changes and whatnot. You'd think the log line of ""fairy tale toned comedy in Nazi-occupied Italy"" would get burned through the coals in 2024, but look at the ratings.

So why not give an Oscar to any stupid italian comedy that is released? Why make Paolo Villagio and others that make films just like Benigni's feel bad because they didn't have the idea to insert in their films a serious (and incredibly stupid) part concerning the holocaust. The film is really very low quality. If you want to see a quality comedy about the holocaust, try Radu Mihaileanu's (a romanian director) 'Train of Life'('Train de Vie'), which is some million times better(it was written before Benigni's film(and filmed before, I think), and the script was read by Benigni's producer, who should have produced but didn't, and might as well have 'inspired' Benigni, if you see what I mean.

Have you all lost your bloody minds?!,"In the immortal - although very paraphrased - words of Lieutenant Dane: ""*Life* is *beautiful*? Well, kiss my crippled ass!""The first hour or so of this movie felt like being invited to a fancy dinner party in some beautiful restaurant in Toscana and having to spend the entire evening next to some socially challenged, annoying moron with delusions of charm and an inability to ever shut up. The second hour of the film is basically identical except now it's set in a concentration camp. So basically, the film is two hours of unfunny jokes with a Holocaust backdrop thrown in to make it critic-proof. How sad.Imagine a six-year old trapped in the body of a middle-aged Italian man on a steady diet of Red Bull and Ecstasy - that's how I'd describe Roberto Benigni's ""characterization"" of the film's star, Guido. He even has trouble stopping himself from laughing at his own wit at times (although referring to Benigni's humour as ""wit"" is like calling Xzibit an accomplished thespian. I'm not even sure it can be called ""humour"" - it's almost insulting to such masters of the genre as Adam Sandler or Owen Wilson). I guess this is how you win an Oscar these days. If you want to see a truly good performance from a comedian playing a foreigner, look no further than Sacha Baron Cohen's ""Borat"" which was released last year (I'm just telling you this in case you've been living under a rock for some time, or if you're from Ohio - in that case, I'm sorry). At least in that film, the main character was *supposed* to be mildly retarded, while in Benigni's movie the lead makes you unsure if you should laugh or cry as he hogs up precious screen time with his oh-so-hilarious antics. Sacha Baron Cohen was, by the way, almost completely ignored by the Academy. Go figure.The film's plot is about one man trying to make life less unbearable for a little doe-eyed kid throughout their stay in a concentration camp. They don't arrive at the concentration camp, however, before one excruciating hour of Benigni's constant mugging and a love story that rings so false it would make even Michael Bay retch. The second hour of the film is considerably less light-hearted than the first but just as boring, repetitive and unrealistic. In reality, a guy like Guido wouldn't have survived a week in a concentration camp. Chances are if the Nazis didn't kill him first, the other Jews would have, if only to shut him up for once. Just how the hell did Guido manage to keep Doe-Eyed Child Actor hidden from the Nazis for so long? The film can't possibly be supposed to be serious - it's too implausible - and it's not nearly funny enough to be a comedy. What a mess.The film only hints at the true horrors of the Holocaust and never really shocks or disturbs you. It doesn't say anything that we didn't already know about this tragedy and the unfunny jokes only make it more offensive. Ask yourself this: does Jim Carrey have anything to do in a film about the Holocaust? I thought not. Does a second-rate hack with only a shred of Carrey's comic talent but with the same urge to mug and overact have anything to do in a film about the Holocaust?? I think not!All this aside, the film is competently made in most other aspects, with some beautiful scenery and a not-too-awful score. Other than that this is an embarrassing and inexplicably acclaimed ego-trip. The only truly funny thing about this disaster is how everyone is calling it a masterpiece and actually believe that the Oscars were well deserved! Oh well, people loved ""Crash"", too (Paul Haggis' 'RACISM SUCKS' epic, not the one where James Spader has sex with a leg wound). Honestly, this film is so corny I'm surprised aliens didn't etch secret messages in it with their rayguns. How can you hand out a Best ""Foreign"" Picture Oscar to a flick that ends with a freeze frame of a mother hugging her child? Seriously, a FREEZE FRAME? Give me a break or some insulin because this is too much sugar for me.In conclusion, this film is manipulative, completely unrealistic, offensively stupid and features one of the least likely love stories ever. And it's unfunny. Dreadfully, hopelessly, comatose-ly unfunny. This coming from a person who could find something to laugh at in ""Scary Movie 2"". Trust me, I laugh very easily at various kinds of comedies, and ""Life is Beautiful"" is easily one of the worst movies ever to win an Oscar.And please don't call me insensitive, heartless, or soulless... I don't call you a tasteless, easily manipulated sheep, now do I?Finally, I'd just like to say that Benigni has one of the scariest smiles I've ever seen. Think Jack Nicholson, Tom Cruise and Rip Torn combined times a hundred. Every time his mouth twisted into one of his well-practiced, sh!t-eating grins (and this happens almost every twenty seconds throughout the movie, so don't worry, you won't miss it) I had an overwhelming urge to run from the room screaming. Avoid this movie.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"What a wonderful, uplifting example of how life ought to be lived.","I saw this movie early on the evening of the Oscars, and I came home and did something I haven't done in years.  I stayed up all the way to the end of that always overdrawn show to see if this movie would win.  Perhaps this movie is a fable, but it is one with something better than a moral at the end.  Benigni provides us all with a wonderful example of how man, in the face of the greatest challenges can still look out at others and do his or her best to brighten their world, especially the world of children, to help them laugh and have a better day.  I don't watch movies with sub-titles all that often, but it made no difference (after the first ten minutes which were needed to adapt).  In fact, I cannot imagine another voice replacing that of Benigni's, which so perfectly radiates his warmth and enthusiasm for life.  Go see this movie; then go see it again.

the greatest adventure in the most important period of the world's history.,"first of all, we have to applaud to benigni, for bringing the true and painful story of the jewish people, during WW2. in that sense, benigni have missed the real atmosphere in a real concentration camp. well, no movie will ever succeed in bringing us the true feeling in those camps, not even 'schindler's list'. the reason is simple - we just wouldn't believe that occurences like that have realy happend in europe of the 20th century and because we like happy ends in the movies that we go to.in his one man show, 'la vita e bella', benigni succeeds in other things, as he manages to bring us a sad story with great humour. as he manages to explain to a 5 y/o boy about the dreadful events in those days.this is a two part movie.  the first one is brighter, as it tells guido's story. his life are happy, colourfull, with a lot of fun, laughs and romance.  the second part is darker as it tells guido's adventures in the con. camp.  he looks tired, sad and frustrated, with the only hope of seeing his beloved wife again and saving the boy's mentality with a stupid game that he invented.the game is what's keeping guido alive at his period in the camp.  he starts making new rules for his son every day and by that he keeps his motivation to survive.the perfect music in each of the two equally timed parts, is changing from happy tunes in the first to sad and slow in the other.dr. lessing symbolizes the irrational change that Hitler opposed on the German people.  throughout the film he admires guido's charector and inteligence.  he even saves his life in one point of the movie, but it was only to ask guido a riddle that he couldn't manage to resolve.  the riddles are also symbols applied on the nazis mechanic charrector, and there are lots of more symbols benigni's giving along the story.the names have been also picked smartly.  for example 'guido', who stands for jewish and 'josue', who satnds for the son who replaces his father (like joshua have replaced moses in the bible).  it seems like every part in the story and in the making of the film was picked very carefully (even the boy's blonde hair to show us that jewish people are not so different) by benigi, especially in the perfect end, when it all comes together like in a perfect harmony.the people who left the movie theater in tel aviv, where all crying in all 10 times that i saw it.  some have cried because of the moving, wonderfull story and some because of the remembrance of their period in the nazi concentration and death camps all over europe.THANK YOU benigni for making the film, and THANK YOU for making it so good. this is a ""must see"" movie for everyone.

Life is beautiful,"I feel bad for people who refuse to watch foreign films, purely because they're subtitled because they're missing out. I'm not someone who gets really emotionally involved with movie. I never cry but this movie had me on the verge of tears.This movie does actually have a pleasant and goofy tone for the first half an hour or so with Robert Benigni imitating school teachers and riding around on horses, but after that half an hour I was an emotional wreck.

bittersweet beauty,"Many opinions have been written concerning this film.  This is but one. It's hard to imagine that so many aspects of life could be put into a single film.

Truly a masterwork, by any standard. By the way, if you've decided for your own sake to get the dubbed-English version (""so's yuh don't haff to do all dat reeding"") - you're only robbing yourself - the distributors are going to make their money off it either way, and one aspect of the film's true beauty is the melodic language that runs through the whole film (I myself don't understand any Italian, but it's like a song to hear the actors roll off their vibrant dialogue).

The look at the Holocaust horror was respectful, and the first half was very funny, though I had to take some time to get to like Benigni, because the memory I had of him was of the terrible and unfunny Son of the Pink Panther, but once I got used to him I discovered his abilities as a comedian.The film is OK, it's a little film, both funny and touching.

The movie is close to perfection,"Because love and trust can withstand even the most trying circumstances, in this case, Nazi inhumane imprisonment. There is no need to overemphasize the plot of this extremely popular and regarded film. Momentarily, as I see it, this film merits every one of the honours it's been granted. Although the movie is close to perfection, I feel that Mr. Benigni's presentation could have been more understated, particularly in the parts set in the death camps. However, this is just a slight irritation. For a happy, invigorating film, Life Is Delightful is tops. In any case, be aware that as its main setting is hostile to Semitism and Nazi homicide, it's anything but a cheerful film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

The Holocaust was one of the worst moments in human history and to see it played for laughs turned my stomach.

A Father's Sacrifice,"Just experienced the emotional rollercoaster that is ""Life is Beautiful,"" and I'm still grappling with the impact of this extraordinary film. Directed by and starring Roberto Benigni, this Italian tragicomedy takes you on a journey through the darkest depths of human history while somehow managing to find beauty and humor in the most unlikely places.Let's start with Benigni's performance. The man is a revelation. His portrayal of Guido, a Jewish man imprisoned in a concentration camp, is a delicate balance of heart-wrenching emotion and comedic brilliance. Benigni's charisma is infectious, and his ability to inject humor into the grimmest of situations is nothing short of genius. No wonder he walked away with the Academy Award for Best Actor; it's a performance that stays with you long after the credits roll.""Life is Beautiful"" is a masterclass in blending genres. It seamlessly transitions from a charming romantic comedy set in pre-World War II Italy to a harrowing depiction of life inside a concentration camp. The contrast is stark, but the film handles it with grace, making the emotional impact even more profound. It's a testament to Benigni's storytelling prowess that he can make you laugh and cry in the same breath.The narrative structure is another standout element. The first half of the film introduces us to Guido's whimsical world, filled with love, laughter, and an unwavering optimism. As the story takes a dark turn with the characters' internment in a concentration camp, that optimism becomes a beacon of hope in the bleakest of circumstances. The way Benigni intertwines the two halves is nothing short of cinematic brilliance.The relationship between Guido and his son, GiosuÃ¨, is the emotional core of the film. Guido's relentless determination to shield his son from the horrors of their reality by turning their situation into a game is both heartwarming and heart-wrenching. The innocence of GiosuÃ¨ and his belief in the game adds a layer of poignancy that tugs at your heartstrings.Visually, the film is a treat. The vibrant colors of the pre-war scenes sharply contrast with the muted tones of the concentration camp, emphasizing the stark shift in the characters' lives. The cinematography captures the beauty in the ordinary and the brutality of the extraordinary with equal finesse.""Life is Beautiful"" is a profound exploration of the resilience of the human spirit. It doesn't shy away from the atrocities of history, yet it manages to find moments of joy and love that transcend the darkness. The film's title is both a mantra for Guido and a poignant message that lingers with the audience, prompting reflection on the preciousness of life even in the face of unspeakable horrors.In conclusion, ""Life is Beautiful"" is a cinematic masterpiece that defies easy categorization. It's a testament to the power of storytelling to illuminate the human experience in all its complexity. Roberto Benigni's vision, coupled with his stellar performance, creates a film that is equal parts heartrending and uplifting, leaving an indelible mark on anyone fortunate enough to experience its magic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

English-dubbed version does not let this movie down,"The English version of La Vita Ã¨ Bella is perfectly true to the spirit of this film.

No laughs here,I'm sorry but I could not get beyond the fact that this was a comedy about the Holocaust. Is the World so screwed up that everything can be commercialised? I find it especially offensive when non-Jews make these comedies. Its hardly like the Italians have anything to be proud of in the way they treated the Jews during the war. If the film was a German comedy about the Holocaust would it have won an Oscar I wonder? I am sorry but making a comedy about the Holocaust or about Cambodia or some other genocide is just not a good idea. Making a slap-stick comedy about such an event is simply tasteless. No surprise it was so popular in the US.Its not that good comedies can't touch on these subjects - Cabaret is not only funny but a musical - and I think its excellent in lots of ways. Most importantly its respectful for those who died when the Nazis took Berlin. Life is Beautiful lacks respect. The fact it comes from a country that was an ally in with Germany in the Holocaust is unforgiveable.,1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Life is Beautiful is absolutely beautiful!!,"'Life is Beautiful' is a heart wrenching drama disguised as a comedy. Wow, this was awesome!Roberto Begnini is excellent as Guido, the most lovable con artist you will ever meet. The film uses interesting and unique dialogue that is actually really funny. At times Roberto comes across as the Italian version of Mr Bean. He simply is excellent.The first half of the film sets up Guido's character and the people he cares about, and its so easy to love them. Around the halfway mark, the film takes an unexpected, dramatic turn. Despite the deep and sad theme, they manage to keep the film lighthearted thanks to Guido's attempts to fool his son into thinking the harsh reality is actually part of a game. To my knowledge, this is the first ever for a film to take this approach on serious matters like war and the horrors against Jews. One could argue that it is no laughing matter, but I believe this was not their intention. It simply is a dreary situation viewed through the eyes of a happy-go-lucky dad trying to protect his son, and trying to remain calm regardless of the odds.By the time the film reaches the final moments, it is truly heart wrenching.

It is a testament to how we humans are capable of meaninglessly killing each other and how we humans are also capable of finding meaning in this abyss of insanity.

Modern Classic,"Roberto Benigni wrote, directed, and is the lead character, Guido Orefice, a Jewish- Italian man in this black comedy which won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1997. It reminded me of Lena Wertmuller's Seven Beauties from 1975; though, in my opinion, not as good.Guido pursues Dora, a non-Jewish girl from a wealthy family who are not thrilled with her future husband. They have son, Giosue, and the family is put into a concentration camp on the boy's birthday, so Guido makes the experience into a game to protect his son from the horrors of the war. He tells him that if he hides from the guards and keeps quiet, he will earn points with the top prize being a tank.They continue in the ploy until the American troops arrive to liberate the camp. Benigni is likable and his real life wife, Nicoletta Braschi, is Dora, his on screen spouse, and they have wonderful chemistry together.

A Perfect Film,"""Life is Beautiful"" (1997) is an absolute masterpiece that unquestionably earns a perfect 10/10 stars for its unparalleled combination of humor, poignancy, and sheer brilliance. Directed and starring Roberto Benigni, this Italian gem transcends the boundaries of traditional cinema, delivering an emotionally resonant narrative that is both profoundly moving and exquisitely crafted.At the heart of the film is a captivating and beautifully unconventional love story set against the backdrop of World War II. Benigni's portrayal of Guido, a spirited and optimistic Jewish man determined to shield his young son from the harsh realities of the concentration camp, is nothing short of extraordinary. His performance is a perfect blend of comedic genius and raw emotion, creating a character that leaves an indelible mark on the viewer's heart.""Life is Beautiful"" is a triumph in storytelling, seamlessly shifting between the lighthearted whimsy of Guido's antics and the somber reality of the wartime atrocities. The film's ability to navigate between these contrasting tones with grace and finesse is a testament to Benigni's directorial prowess.The film's emotional depth is further heightened by its exploration of the indomitable human spirit and the power of love and laughter in the face of unimaginable adversity. The bond between Guido and his son GiosuÃ¨ serves as the emotional anchor of the narrative, offering a poignant commentary on the resilience of the human soul.The cinematography and art direction in ""Life is Beautiful"" are nothing short of breathtaking, capturing both the whimsy of Guido's world and the stark reality of the concentration camp with equal finesse. The visual beauty of the film serves as a powerful backdrop to the profound themes it explores.Additionally, the film's musical score, composed by Nicola Piovani, enhances the emotional impact, creating a symphony of feelings that resonates long after the credits roll.For its profound impact on the soul and its artistic brilliance, ""Life is Beautiful"" unquestionably deserves a perfect 10/10 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"A wonderful Tragicomedy on the most inhuman act of 20th century, the Holocaust of Jews.","A wonderful Tragicomedy on the most inhuman act of 20th century, the Holocaust of Jews.How far can you go for your family is what the apt tag line will be for this film. From protecting the wife from inhuman creatures to protecting the innocence of his only son, Guido Orefice does it all for his family and even sacrifices his whole life for them.Roberto Benigni is affable as Guido, a wonderful human being who knows to take everything with a sense of humor. There are turbulent times, the world has changed for him, he is put in the most awful circumstances, even he is caught and will be executed. In all the places, all he does is smile. It's heartening to see a man go through dire circumstances with liveliness and smile. But that tragedy that is to come is fatal and that's where hearts melt for the audience. A happy family is shattered for no fault of their own.In the second world war, Jews were condemned as sinners and executed, it's on of the most insane things ever done, on this planet. Hitler will never be forgive for his sins for centuries.The story is simple, the portrayal is wonderful, the art direction is superb and the other aspects are right. The 2 hours are fun for the first half and heart rending in the second. But all is well in the end. This film is simply beautiful.Loved Roberto Benigni, his wife Nicoletta Braschi (she played Dora, the wife of Guido) and Giorgio Cantarini (he played the role of 5 year old Joshua, son of Guido).

Roberto Benigni is magnificent,"The reason I went to see Life Is Beautiful was to see the performance of Roberto Benigni and also to see if humour and the holocaust could be blended in a movie. I also wanted to see if the happy manic energy that Roberto displayed at the Oscars was apparent in his work. I feel that Roberto Benigni was absolutely charming, disarming, beguiling, supremely inventive and hugely compassionate in his desire to win the heart of his loved one and then to shield his child from the horrors of the holocaust by game playing. I believe that the use of humour in the holocaust setting was extremely well done. Everyone should have some one like Roberto Benigni to shield them by caring enough to divert their attention through humour and unconditional love from the never ending harsh realities that beset the world.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Begnini is no Chaplin,"There is no subject in the world sacred or horrific enough that it cannot be dramatized for cinema. Holocaust, because it occurred so recently, is deemed an unfilmable taboo by many. Some of the people I know, refused to see Benigni's controversial film out of sheer principle. I resisted seeing it as well, but not because of the nature of its topic. Everything can be approached from many different angles, and in this case, Comedy has the most risk in striking wrong notes with the viewers. At times, Comedy ,particularly in the guise of social satire, can expose truth and even present it in a bold, provocative manner. But a Holocaust comedy? Of course, life in the concentration camp can provide plenty of material for life-affirming sentimentality, but as presented in ""Life is Beautiful"" it is obviously FALSE. This is simply milking a historical event of great importance to modern humanity, for the purpose of luring an unsophisticated audience to admire one's work. Benigni without a doubt makes a talented comic, and the first half of the film, when his big-mouthed character mocks Italian fascism, IS funny, precisely because it's satire. As soon as he and his on-screen son are shipped off to the camp, the object of ridicule becomes less clear. What we get is a soft toned, PG-rated, annoyingly unrealistic treatment of unspeakably brutal conditions, where death and disease prevailed. In a fantasy or a science fiction setting, the duo's exploits could have worked, but to anyone who is aware of history, they would seem implausible. It's surely a noble effort to protect one's child from the terrifying reality by pretending that the whole setting is a game, but unfortunately, had it been a real camp, both father and son would have perished within a week of their ordeal: the later would die of starvation, the former be shot on sight for excessive talking or better yet, silenced by his irritated fellow prisoners. Chaplin, whom the director is often compared to, in The Great Dictator, never even tried to exploit the ""Final Solution""; wisely, he stuck to Hitler and his henchmen. Besides, Chaplin was most brilliant at silent comedy. Benigni, on the other hand, just can't seem to shut up.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

More than just entertaining.,"Life is truly beautiful. The whole story is based on a half-full cup and not a half-empty one. The horrific evils of the holocaust are not subdued in the least. The looks and gestures of the nazis will hit us all hard as we cringe even in this comedy film. We all know the ins and outs of those monsters. But do we realize that even in the concentration camps, people who valued charity more than anything, died living their last days exemplifying such a virtue? Is our society so beyond this realization? Would you be able to do the same for your child? Or are we so enveloped in self-satisfaction, that we miss the very premise of this film? We can and should go beyond the human condition. Why? Because we can.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"Intense, poetic, simply beutiful...","This is one of my favourite movie and, without a shadow of a doubt, a film that everyone should see because of its historical and cinematic importance. Roberto Benigni's Life is Beautiful (or, in Italian, La Vita Ã¨ Bella) won the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival in 1998, around nine David di Donatello Awards in Italy and three Oscars at the 1999 Oscar Ceremony (which included the awards for Best Foreign Film, Best Actor and Best Soundtrack). Incredibly, the achievements don't stop there, given that it is also the most watched film on Italian television, garnering a total of sixteen million viewers when it was broadcast in 2001.Inspired by the book Ho Sconfitto Hitler by Rubino Romeo SalmonÃ¬, Life is Beautiful is a dramatic comedy that tries to bring an essence of optimism and hope to a struggle for survival in extreme circumstances. Negatively criticised for conveying a ""comic and light-hearted"" approach to what happened at the beginning of the narrative, Life is Beautiful in no way diminishes or ridicules the horrific and inhumane events of the Holocaust. On the contrary, we see the struggle and sacrifice of a father's love for his son's safety, even doing the impossible to make things right. A tragic-poetic narrative that leaves the viewer glued to the screen, wishing for the best possible scenario for the characters. In this emotional story we meet the Jewish Guido Orefice (played by Roberto Benigni), an outgoing waiter with a unique active humour who meets Dora (played by Nicoletta Braschi), an upper-class Italian woman with whom he falls in love. The first part of the narrative explores Guido and Dora's relationship in Mussolini's Fascist Italy during the 1930s, followed by the second part, which takes up most of the movie. Now married to Dora, the father of little GiosuÃ© (played by Giorgio Cantarini) and now the owner of a bookshop, Guido has the misfortune of being sent (along with his son and his uncle, the old Eliseo) to a concentration camp due to Jewish persecution during the Second World War. It's at this point in the narrative that the initially comical and brazen character is inverted into a narrative of tension and sensitivity, capable of leaving any viewer with tears in their eyes. In order to keep his son safe and keep him ""pure and innocent"", Guido pretends that the whole event is a game where everyone is against everyone and the ""final prize"" is a real battle tank (since GiosuÃ© likes tanks). Guido's physical and mental efforts override the human limit, doing everything possible to keep his son hidden and untouchable inside the concentration camp. This is a story of paternal love, affection and resistance against the dictatorial authoritarianism of what was a bloodthirsty regime. Roberto Benigni, the great star of Italian cinema, gives all his talent and soul to a performance worthy of the Oscar he won.It's a movie that stands alongside cult classics like Schindler's List and The Pianist, strong and reflective for many (including me, who always lets a few tears fall when I watch this masterpiece). Films like these are an account of a past that must never happen again, stories of pain, suffering and great sadness. All of us, unique and rational elements of a global society, must fight for this society to remain fair, equal and civic-minded. Even in the midst of chaos and destruction, where there seems to be no escape, there is always a ray of hope where we can laugh and fight against oppression. I finish this review by giving the film a rating of 10/10, leaving my deep and sincere recommendation.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
This extraordinary picture should win the Academy Award,"Life is Beautiful is a true masterpiece, depicting what family, love, and hope really is.  Joshua, Dora, and the beloved Guido, have a wonderful and intimate relationship, and one that will never be torn apart.  As a 15 year old, this movie moved me and helped me reflect upon Judaism and made me proud.  Benigni directed this movie beautifully, combining a comedic beginning with a dramatic, sorrowful, yet hopeful ending.

beautiful,"So I've finally gotten around to watch this movie, years and years after its release. First of all let me say that I'm usually not a fan of Benigni's work, but this film was a wonderful exception. This is first and foremost a story of a man's love for his son and wife. Throughout the comedy and horrible tragedy that's what's essential. And so you imagine what you yourself would do, would you be able to stay strong for your child and want to protect them and make them laugh even when you're all worn out?! You'd hope so...Benigni in this film is a worthy 'tramp' in the style of Chaplin. There's a healthy mixture of sad and funny moments and somehow the film manages to stay very serious and lighthearted at a time. I was however a bit stunned by the sudden ending but apart from that it's all in all a very good film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

One of the best movies I've ever seen,"For those who have critcized ""Life is Beautiful"" for ""making light"" of the holocaust have missed the whole point of the film. The film was not intended to be a documentary of sorts about what horrors that were inflicted in concentration camps. The movie is about love and making the ultimate sacrifice for that love.The ""game"" that Guido convinces his son about isn't intended to deceive the child. Though he was lying, he was doing it to protect his son's innocence at such a tender age. How else could you explain to a child, without absolutely traumatizing him, the horror and inhumanity of intense hatred? How would you tell a child that he will probably die simply because of his race? We have to see this movie through the eyes of a loving father who will not let hate rob he and his son of their inner joy, no matter what the circumstances are. In that respect they truly won by not letting their will be broken and their hopes be dashed.Many of the people who dislike ""Life is Beautiful"" laud ""Schindler's List"" because it is a more serious film. Yes, ""Schindler's List"" was an excellent film but its focus was mostly on the violence of the holocaust. Just because Roberto Benigni didn't show people getting shot in mass quantities every 15-20 minutes, for 3 hours, doesn't make it any less effective in relating the experiecnce of the camps. I was very disturbed by the murders and violence in ""Schindler's List"" but I was actually moved by it only a few times. Eventually the people became nameless casualties that just piled up. You didn't know their stories and you could only guess their feelings.To me, the main element that made ""Life is Beautiful"" so excellent is that it takes the focus off of the violence and gives us the emotions of the characters. I got to know Guido, Dora, and Joshua. I truly felt the emotions pouring out of their performances.Many if us have gotten so used to everything being shown to us and spelled out in films that we've started to leave our brains behind. The horror and violence is only implied, but you should be able to use your head and read between the lines.No, the movie is not based around the lightest period in history. But Benigni managed to show us that laughter can indeed be the best medicine, if only temporary.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

The first half shows us a funny part of Guido's story, already a highly witted person with no shortage of optimism, in getting by his life and reaching for his love Dora. The second half displays how Guido, now a father, shields his son from the grieve of a concentration camp, all while always incorporating his wits to get by things, his optimism and enthusiasm to get by with his son's curiosity, and having a fair share of luck that eventually saves his son's life. I rarely see such a movie that can turn its mood from the happy tone into one of a sad tone so drastically, yet the happiness is still there even in the sad moments. The background is of course the classic and usual set of World War II's Europe, but again the developed story takes us to see the war from a very touching angle. Of course there are pot holes and things that don't really make sense, But the story itself is so touching that it belittles the shortcomings.

Dolce Vita,"'La Vita Ã¨ Bella' - better known as 'Life is Beautiful' - this Roberto Benigni movie focuses on a free-spirited Italian Jew who pretends for his son that being sent to a concentration camp is part of an elaborate game. One's mileage with the film will vary based on whether one views him lying to his son as benevolent or utterly irresponsible; certainly, the film celebrates his efforts to shelter his son, but he also often places the boy in danger by not letting him know how serious everything is. The film is hampered by a roundabout structure with 45 minutes of childish pranks by the protagonist as he romances his wife to-be before his son is born. Things admittedly pick up well once the son enters the picture, but with slapstick gags beforehand including splattered eggs, it is certainly a bumpy ride. That said, there is a lot of cleverness in how the protagonist manipulates every situation (especially mistranslating a stern guard) in order to convince his son that it is all one big game. There are some very tense moments too, such as when his son accidentally says thank-you. A lot of suspension of disbelief is required though given how many shenanigans they get away with (sneaking off at will; using the concentration camp PA) and therefore it is hard to consider the film very realistic. It does admittedly resonate somewhat though as a tale of fatherly devotion and trying to make the best of bad situation.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

The Bittersweet Beauty of Life,"In Life Is Beautiful, the cinematic canvas unfurls a story that is as tender as the strokes of an artist's brush on a delicate masterpiece. Set against the backdrop of World War II, this film weaves together laughter and tears, ultimately enveloping you in a warm embrace.Guido, portrayed by the enchanting Roberto Benigni, is the film's radiant heart. His playful spirit and unshakable optimism are like a sunbeam on a cloudy day, illuminating the lives of those around him. Guido's boundless love for his son, GiosuÃ¨, is a testament to the enduring power of a parent's devotion. He shields GiosuÃ¨ from the harsh reality of a concentration camp by weaving an intricate web of imagination and storytelling, where every day becomes a game, every rule a challenge, and every hardship a test of their resilience. Guido crafts a world for his son within the confines of a concentration camp. His unyielding determination to shield GiosuÃ¨ from the horrors of reality is both heart-wrenching and heartwarming.In the midst of the darkest of circumstances, Guido's unwavering determination to preserve his son's innocence is a poignant reminder of the indomitable human spirit that is both heart-wrenching and heartwarming. His antics in the camp, from translating the commands of the guards into a comical language to his uproarious attempts to win a tank, infuse the harsh reality of war with a whimsical outlook on life, reminding us that even in the bleakest of times, there is room for laughter.Life Is Beautiful is a film that dances between laughter and tears, much like the fleeting moments of joy and sorrow in our own lives. It captures the essence of love's ability to transcend the harshest realities. The cinematography is a visual delight, with scenes that linger on the beauty of human connection, even in the bleakest of circumstances. It is bathed in warm hues and framed with poetic precision, paints a picture of hope in the midst of despair. The evocative score by Nicola Piovani is a gentle caress to the senses, guiding us through moments of joy and sorrow.The film's bittersweet conclusion is a testament to the enduring impact of love, humor, and hope. It reminds us that life's beauty can be found in the simplest of gestures and the profound bonds we forge with those we hold dear.In essence, Life Is Beautiful is a cinematic masterpiece that encourages us to find joy in the everyday, cherish the bonds we share, and celebrate the resilience of the human spirit. It invites us to dance with life, finding beauty in the most unexpected corners of our existence. It is a poignant reminder that even in the face of unimaginable adversity, love and laughter prevail.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

A Brilliant piece of motion picture art,"I see a lot of movies and not many can be described as art. Well, this one definately qualifies. The story of a man's love for his wife and son has so many facets that a 1000 words would not be enough to describe it. I thought the acting of Cantarini was excellent. This young man was casted to a very high standard of performance. I could compare it to Anna Paquinn in The Piano, only better. The story could indeed be compared to Schindler's List in that one gets to see the picture from the victims' side, without the war being the centre of the plot. I felt that the lesson to be learned here was that one can rise above one's life situation and problems. You saw how heavy those steel things were that Guido had to carry and how tired he was. But, for the sake of his child, he stayed positive and focussed on calming the child. Guido gave the ultimate sacrifice of love, namely his life to his family. This scene must be one of the most intence I have ever experienced. One wishes he would come out from behind that wall and laugh in your face and tell you like Jim Carrey would that it is only a joke, but he doesn't.

A horrible letdown!,"I'm sorry, but I think this movie is extremely overrated. I did not find it the least bit beautiful or emotional. I give them credit for trying to make a realistic depiction of the Holocaust, but I was completely unaffected. I loved Schindler's List, which is in my opinion an enormously superior film. I have always been horrified by visions and stories of the Holocaust, but this movie doesn't even come close to sticking with me. It has to be one of the most overrated movies I have ever seen in my life. I also think that it is a Shakespearean tragedy that Roberto Benigni won an Oscar for this performance. A truly horrible letdown!! I give it a 2 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Mediocre film that doesn't understand what it wants to be,"It shouldn't be surprising that this movie isn't a very great one, as it is very hard to take a matter like the holocaust and try to create a parody of it as Benigni tries to do here. Yet it has been done before succesfully, but unfortunately Life is Beautiful is not one of these instances.It seems to be a movie with the central message that you can find hope in anything or anyone, yet it comes off as a sitcom with jokes you just can't seem to laugh about. Benigni himself was overacting like a madman the entire film, yet comically, dramatically and emotionally he does not seem to make any dent whatsoever. The story is also rushed. He suddenly has a child and expects that this is his free ticket in order to feel sympathy for his character, yet it comes across as a cheap way to get the audiences undeserved sympathies. Benigni uses clichÃ©'d jokes that we have all seen before, rendering it inaffective as a comedy film. The movie doesn't take itself seriously enough in its seemingly serious setting of the holocaust, making it also fail as a dramatic or emotional film. Ofcourse Dr Strangelove by Kubrick is an example of where it actually works to create a comic effect over a serious matter, but this is generally because the comic aspect is a lot funnier, the dramatic aspect is a lot more plausible, Peter Sellers is simply a better actor than Benigni, and the film knows at all times it does not take itself seriously, unlike this one.The cinematography is alright, but nothing special. There are a couple of nice landscape shots and the scene where the train arrives are quite nicely filmed, but it is nothing to cry home about. The music is decent, but not enough to make you emotionally involved in the picture like Ennio Morricone's score for fellow italian film Cinema Paradiso (1988) managed to do so well. There are also a lot of scenes in the latter part of the film where particular scenes could have easily been drawn out to create a more dramatic effect, yet Benigni cuts everything short and everything seems to end way too abruptly and quickly, negating any kind of emotional connection you might be starting to feel. I would say despite the fact that Benigni was even worse in the first half of the film, i would still prefer the first over the second, as atleast it seemed to know which direction it was going at that point, but in the second it turned into an unfocused mess of sillyness to the point where we cannot absorb any kind of dramatic or emotional impact we were supposed to get.If you ignore all these obvious issues, which i am certain a lot of people did, some might consider it a movie with a message, yet you are indifferent to any possible message since the characters seem indifferent to the situation.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Greatest Movie of all Times,"What a movie! Kudos to Roberto Benigni and others for making such a wonderful movie. There have been many great movies over the years but this is indeed special,very special.Such a strong message is expressed in such a beautiful way, this is the speciality of this movie . Even the title of this movie is so appropriate, not only for this movie but for life in general.Life is filled with so many uncertainties, one moment there is happiness, and immediately after that one is overpowered with grief, sorrow and troubles.But inspite of all this vagariesLIFE IS BEAUTIFUL.This is the central idea of this film and there is no better way to portray this than that shown by Roberto Benigni. This is arguably one of the greatest movies of all times. A Great period story coupled with mind boggling performances, excellent direction editing etc make it a movie that leaves an indellible impression on the viewer's mind. Roberto Benigni and others involved in this film should be very proud of it.It would indeed be very difficult to make a movie better than this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
A true masterpiece for interesting reasons:,"I never imagined that a film could reach so deep into my heart, communicate so much laughter and at the same time hurt so much. And neither the laughter nor the pain was due to manipulation, but to compassion and true empathy. At the surface this film might be beautifully surrealistic, but that seems to be merely the attractive language, the vehicle used to transport something really essential about life and hope and love.There can be no doubt whatsoever that for me this was the most deeply felt and ""real"" movie experience of this century. If art is to say something ""true"", ""deep"", ""universal"" or ""cosmic"" about life, La Vita Ã¨ bella is BIG art.I think that in the future of moviemaking we will see more of the traits that causes many people to feel deeply moved by La Vita Ã¨ bella.La vivo ja belegas!!(Life is indeed beautiful!!)",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

One of the best cinematic experience ever!,"If you still have not watched this movie it is a real pity. This Academy Award Winning flick is certainly one of the most engrossing, captivating gem of a movie. Benigni did everything in this film. He wrote, produced, directed and probably swept the floors at night. There is that much raw energy in this film.This is one of those movies that have a lasting effect on you. After watching it, I found that it has less to do with the Holocaust and more to do with the human feelings and the beautiful relationship of a father and his son. The holocaust provides the ultimate context, that brings and highlights the story and adds yet another deep dimension to the movie. Life Is Beautiful manages to walk the extremely thin line between humor, fantasy, and tragedy. Sure, the film is clearly comedic, but nevertheless it manages to very effectively communicate the tremendous losses suffered in the Nazi concentration camps and has scenes at least as intense as any scene in Schindler's List.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Unbelievably Charming in a Depressing Era,"For a long time, I put off watching this movie because I was tired of being depressed over the many tragic and dark WWII movies. A friend of mine popped in the movie without letting anyone know what it is, and I found myself immediately synced into the charming and uplifting movie. Yes, there is tragedy and death. Yes, there is a darker underlying tone to the movie. Yes, we are talking about the Holocaust and it is impossible to reprimand and ignore the atrocities committed during that time.However, if there is one Holocaust movie that successfully alters your mood in a positive way, this is it. I was shocked how well the story progresses in an uplifting manner even as the progression is paralleled with an equally dark, yet not overwhelming side of the story.If you have not dedicated the time for this movie, ignore any of the negative critics and reviews, this is a fantastic movie!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"the best film this year which make us laugh, when our hearts cry.","it is absolutely a touching and joyful moment when i saw Benigni jumped on the Oscar stage and received the little gold man. he deserves all these, as he really produce a film which is 100% beautiful. Life is Beautiful is one of the most best and encouraging film throughout these decades....I hope Benigni will continue on his good work and present us of his beautiful view of life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"Great start, horrible end",This film 1st half is a wonderful use of whimsy.  The love story is enchanting.  Though the dialogue for the first 10 minutes is a little fast and hard to keep up with the subtitles.Then it moves to the concentration camp and the whimsy does not work. Benigni completely romanticizes it.  No one is dirty or overly thin.  And a blurry shot of a pile of bones does not make up for this.This also pushes this modern attitude that we should lie to our children and tell them everything that happens and they do is great.  This is wrong.And Benigni definitely shouldn't have won best actor.  But it is high irony that Tom Hanks finally gave a complex and human portrait of a man and lost to a sentimental performance like he won both of his for.,6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"You can see why it was a success, but it wasn't that good...","As I said, this film can easily pass as one of the most emotional and thought-provoking stories in modern cinema. Its big success worldwide, mostly in the U.S., spells out the mainstream ingredients for a successful film. It is quite simple really how this clown-like parody of WWII got to earn so much money: relationships between people, and relying upon one another.. These two sentences may sound simple and over-profound, even too usual and melodramatic for some tastes, but believe me, they are the everlasting secrets of how to make a movie sell. Movies that have to do with companionship, love, friendship, helping one another, make money.Movies that have to do with loners, death, and the impossibility of love, do not make money.Think about a rather recent example. Why do you think the academy and the audiences preferred the even ""Million Dollar Baby"" to the spectacular ""Aviator""? Simple. ""Million Dollar Baby"" was about friendship, love, companionship and sacrifice. The ""Aviator"" was about a recluse, the lonely life of a psychotic millionaire, a film about ONE person.If you really think about it, the most successful films of all time are the kind of soapy melodramas whose superficial sentimentality hypnotizes the minds of the mainstream viewer. It's not about action and happy endings, a rather falsely perceived Hollywood notion about a successful film, but rather a movie that deals with bonding and friendship. Would ""Lord of the Rings"" have made so much money if it hadn't been about the FELLOWSHIP of people/creatures?? Not really. It's almost impossible to imagine how a film that is not about bonding can be successful. The retention of the illusion of film can only be achieved if the viewer can idolize the sacred value of love. Be it amorous or otherwise. And this is it. This is why movies like ""Shawshank Redemtion"" and ""Titanic"" will always sell more than ""8 1/2"" and ""Andrei Roublev"". They are more collectivist whereas the other two are more individualist. Once such notions as family, love and friendship are celebrated on screen, the viewer seems to like it better. And it is obvious, isn't it?? No matter how good a film is (meaning the story, the acting, the direction, the music) it will always sell if it focuses on the triumph of human bonding.In this case, ""La Vita e Bella"" was successful because of that. It was a film about the love and sacrifice of a father for his son. Period. That's all one has to hear to like this film. Its extremely bad aspects are immediately ignored. No one seems to care that this film was an insult to those who suffered during WWII. No one notices how unrealistic Begnini's portrayal of the clown was, how much of an immature parody of human emotions and historical truths the film was. Behind the silly laughter and the pretentious theme lies a true mockery of WWII, and nobody seems to care about it..",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"Best film of the year, but it won't win much - and that's ok","After having read all of the comments here, I don't want to seem redundant with my praise. Having rated it a ten myself, I must say that I heartily agree with all the superlatives mentioned by so many others...and yet, all of it taken together still doesn't seem to do justice to the film. For me, the comparison to Chaplin is right on the money, this film stands right next to `City Lights' for its `laugh out loud' comedy, and its `hurts so bad', but joyous, tears. The final frames of both films are absolutely devastating, although for far different reasons. And both films are the product of each one's singular vision, which is what makes `La Vita e Bella' such a refreshing change from the `by the numbers', focus group driven style of contemporary American films - like you can imagine some Hollywood bigwigs getting behind a storyline like this! (What! No special effects! No sex! No violence! No Cursing! No teen appeal! No old TV sitcom rip offs! - you get the idea. I doubt that this film's whole budget could have kept the `Titanic' crew on set for more than a day.)  In my humble opinion, this is by far the best picture of the year, but I doubt that it will win much more than token `Oscars', which is as it should be. The Academy Awards are Hollywood's self congratulatory party, and this understated, haunting, lyrical,  and profoundly moving gem stands in opposition to all of Hollywood's recent excesses. As for me, I'll take `Life is Beautiful' over a dozen `Titanic's' any day.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Foreign at its finest,"Sensitive topics such as World War 2 are generally portrayed in their classical sense, where the life of various individuals in either Concentration Camps or battlefields are exposed. Not that there is anything wrong with this, but Life is Beautiful manages to tell the tale of two lovers and their family, and how the War will never dampen their spirits.With the Jewish people being primary targets in the Holocaust, this foreign film displays how true love cannot be broken by the evilest of atrocities, despite race or religion. Happiness is rather difficult to attain, especially for prisoners who are near death, but Life is Beautiful succeeds in demonstrating that a light of hope can shine a dark room.This movie deserves as much praise and accolades than any other. With great acting, starting from the stars to support, Life is Beautiful encompasses the attributes every great movie should. The emotional plot, filled with comical satire, is a cinema any move critic would enjoy.With Italian films being known for their romance and passion, Life is Beautiful should be remembered for being able to reproduce these same qualities in a setting where tomorrow is not always certain.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

But then it became very serious, quite stressful, and highly emotional. This movie is a unique mix of comedy & drama and showcases an extreme example of the great lengths parents will go to protect their children from the horrors of the world.

Amazing,"I was genuinely amused by the first half of the movie.  The comedy was close to a slapstick style, but perfectly suited the personality of Guido.  The second half of the movie was by far the best part.  I was surprised at how Benigni made the worst atrocity of the 21st century into a comedy.  The thing that made the comedy work was how tastefully it was done.  The moral of how life, love, and family can overcome the greatest evil was uplifiting. Overall I give this film a 9/10.

The acting the presentation, the development of the characters is perfect, Roberto Benigini, plays an extremely hard character trying to balance his daily life in the concentration camp, while protecting his son's innocence by telling him that it's all a game, with the first prize being a REAL TANK,This movie could have gone wrong at so many places so easily, amazingly it never does, Roberto Benigini was walking on a very thin wire while making this film, but he does it to perfect, absolute perfection.Easily one of the best cinema in the past two decades.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
One of the 10 greatest films ever,"Unfortunately, too many people seem to think that the only way to portray the Holocaust is with a somber and depressing depiction. While there's nothing wrong with that approach, Benigni's story is a far more compelling one.Everyone knows about the Holocaust and its horrors. Another extremely graphic movie showing that isn't going to strike people's hearts.  All such a movie would have gotten would be comparisons to Schindler's List. Instead, this film gets around that by doing something far more amazing than Schindler's List. It convincingly shows one of the most impossible things I've heard of - it puts humor into the Holocaust.  You'd think such a connection would be ludicrous.  Without seeing the movie, I would probably think so too.Forget that, see the movie.  This movie is perfect. Benigni plays a father who is able to turn the holocaust for his young son into a ""game."" Beningi, through a host of wonderfully funny events is able to hide his son from the horrors from the holocaust. Impossible some people say? Yes, I'm sure it would not have happened in the real holocaust, but that shouldn't become an issue once you've seen the movie, because that's not the point.  The point is to appreciate the strength of love that a father can have for his child and the extraordinary lengths he would go to in even the darkest moments in order for his child to have a better life.

Love thy enemy.,"After watching this movie I cannot think other of Roberto Benigni than genius. He took a different approach to Holocaust and say through his movie that we shouldn't hate the Nazis. Indeed if we are to do anything with them, we should pity them. They were born and raised without love, and they lost a great many opportunity to learn from other races of this world. Guido doesn't want his boy to grow up like them. He wants him to be a loving human being.Another thing that struck me when I'm watching this movie is that Benigni loves his wife very much, he wouldn't cast any other actress as the female lead. He always does that in every movie he directed. I think it just shows that he can't fall in love with another woman than Nicoletta Braschi, even though he lives in Italy where the women are, in my opinion, exceptionally beautiful.

"Benigni attempts to pull the wool over our eyes. This is a dishonest, despicable film.","Widely hailed by the media and culture vultures alike, Life is Beautiful fluffs out its feathers as 'the first ever Holocaust comedy'. ""A Holocaust comedy?"", squawked the masses, ""We'd better see that!"". What's more, it's 'foreign', as in non-American, very much de rigueur in Hollywood circles. But the fact that a film detailing, humorously, with the 20th Century's greatest tragedy won the Oscar accolades it did is enough evidence of its true worth.It starts simply enough, with Benigni as the humble paesan who marries, has a kid, enjoys the good life in pre-war Italy. Soon, the evil Nazis have moved in, and his family is whisked off to a concentration camp where prisoners run around freely and no-one loses weight. Our hero attempts to protect his little boys from the horrors by creating an elaborate trick: telling the little tyke that it is all part of a highly imaginative birthday present. Soon, the film falls into a series of wholly implausible events, and we, as an audience, realise the real trick has been played on us. Benigni, too, seems to think the Holocaust was a trick, reflecting Allied guilt and denial after the Liberation. The fact that the movie was so loved suggests a sinister appraisal of its values: a collective sigh of WASP relief that it actually wasn't as bad as they'd been led to believe.The Guardian newspaper from Manchester & London called it 'fundamentally mendacious' and as such was the only newspaper not fooled by Benigni's three card trick. The writer/star/director of Johnny Stecchino would do best by sticking to what he does best: making humane, funny, light-hearted films. Life is Beautiful is none of these.The Hebrew word for the Holocaust is ""Shoah"".

A Heartwarming Tale of Love and Resilience,"The film is set in Italy during World War II and follows the journey of Guido Orefice, played by Roberto Benigni himself, a carefree and optimistic Jewish man who falls in love with Dora, portrayed by Nicoletta Braschi. As the war escalates and their lives are turned upside down, Guido uses his imagination and humor to shield his young son from the horrors of the concentration camp they are forced into. With unwavering determination, Guido transforms the grim reality into a game, creating a world of wonder and hope for his son amid the darkness.Roberto Benigni's direction is masterful, seamlessly blending the film's comedic and dramatic elements. He navigates the tonal shifts with grace, allowing the humor to shine through in the face of adversity while never losing sight of the underlying gravity of the situation. Benigni's own performance as Guido is remarkable, capturing the character's infectious spirit, boundless love, and unwavering optimism. His chemistry with Nicoletta Braschi, both on and off-screen, adds depth and authenticity to their relationship.""Life Is Beautiful"" is a testament to the strength of human resilience and the power of love in the face of unimaginable hardships. It explores themes of sacrifice, compassion, and the indomitable spirit that can triumph even in the darkest of times. The film's script, also written by Roberto Benigni, balances moments of laughter and tears, highlighting the beauty and fragility of life.The film's technical aspects are understated yet effective. Tonino Delli Colli's cinematography captures the warmth and vibrancy of pre-war Italy, contrasting it with the starkness and brutality of the concentration camp.

(COME/trage)DY,"It is perhaps the only muvy on WWII where u experience & can feel all the horrors, pains n sufferings of holocaust yet with an curious smile in the edge of ur lips. It is a rare muvy which depicts tragedy in the ink of comedy. Benigni is just masterpiece at his work both as an actor as well as director. Perhaps this muvy is somewhat neglected due to its foreign language though we appreciate the awards (oscar) it won. Its highly dramatic & the escapes of the odd situations as done with the might of humor keeps one anticipating. I wud ask all WWII & quality muvy lovers not to go by the foreign language and rather give this a try otherwise u r really at a LOSS.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
This is a beautiful and sad film,"I have seen this film at least a dozen times and each time I am carried away to the dreams of a small boy to come true and we can join his journey. The Italian language (it is subtitled) adds to the film's beauty and music, the characters are so real you can almost smell them. I am absorbed into this film each time I watch it, so that when it is over, I am shocked into the realisation that I haven't actually been anywhere except right there, in my seat. I am not a huge ""art house"" film fan or indeed enjoy subtitled films but ""Life is Beautiful"" is a gem and is worth seeing again and again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Life is beautiful,"""Life is beautiful"" is not a tragedy, and the protagonist's hilarious appearance at the beginning shows that director roberto benigni wants to create an atmosphere of comedy, but definitely not to undermine the film's ideology for the sake of the vulgar public. In fact, on the contrary, Benini did this in order not to fawn on the vulgar, in order to express the deeper thoughts, so as not to let the audience indulge in the shallow feelings. Benini just wants to tell all the people who really love life through this film, the nightmare is temporary, believe that the beautiful life is forever. Even in the concentration camp,the protagonist always wore a smile on his face.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
ONE OF MY TOP FAVORITES,"This is one of the best movies i have ever seen in a very long time, I can't describe how am feeling, how i was feeling the whole movie, in each seen.
The only thing that bothered me is that the movie ended!!!!!
A masterpiece that should be taught in schools.
The love i have for this movie is something else.
An absolute masterpiece",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
WW2 isn't just about Jewish suffering!,"Benigni is lauded by many Jews because he embraced the holocaust.Actually we are overwhelmed with that holocaust theme too much. Schindler's List, The Pianist and this movie...There many be many other movies but these three are the most top-rated ones I guess. Well let me give some statistical knowledge about the WW2.WW2 was a period of immense human(not just Jewish) suffering.Nearly 55 million people lost their lives but only six million of this death toll was Jewish. Due to the holocaust 4 million non-Jews made up of Poles, Roma, homosexuals, communists, dissidents, Afro-Germans, the disabled, Soviet prisoners and others had lost their lives. About about 20 to 28 million Soviets died in total, of which 13 to 20 million were civilians. Now given that these statistic are absolutely true why the these directors insisting make movies on the holocaust?As a human being I sympathize with the Jewish people who suffered immensely then! But as a human being I also sympathize with other non-Jewish people who lost their lives then! Why the heck they don't make movies out of the sufferings of Soviet,Poles,anti-communists etc...? If this Jewish suffering had been so real why does this race's governing council create the same stuff in Palestine with a great newspeak of terrorism? Does the Western have a courage of making a movie on Palestine, Hiroshima,Yugoslavia? Isn't anybody aware that The most notorious atrocities occurred in China, including the slaughter of almost half a million Chinese during the Nanjing Massacre, also known as the Rape of Nanking, and Unit 731's experiments with biological warfare in Manchuria, with a view to killing a large part of the Chinese population. Japanese war crimes also included rape, pillage, murder, cannibalism and forcing female civilians to become sex slaves, known as ""comfort women"". Many of these occurred in Korea, which Japan occupied from 1910 to 1945. Doesn't anybody think it is worth cinematizing the suffering of these people as much as the suffering of Jewish people? It may be a great script to think of a dream quality to make your son survive the concentration camp but it is due to create something else. You may create a dream quality to survive the brothel in Korea or China. Do something for those people. Amen to the Jewish suffering!",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"No, it's not a wonderful, Capraesque life","Life Is Beautiful is perhaps the most celebrated film with an inspiring and motivational purpose. At first, it's a kind of mixture between romanticism and hypothetical wishful thinking, with a motivational aura that has little to do with reality, politics, or harmonious social norms.
But a comedy about the Holocaust?... It surely mounts to pure escapism towards nowhere. Schmaltzy sweetness is not exactly romanticism. There are nuances that distinguish pure romanticism from cathartic sentimentality. The sentimentality that affirms La Vita Ã Bella, as presented, is frankly fake. Benigni makes a talented narrative, but the direct object of his ridiculing led to an indirect, irritating and unrealistic treatment, done in soft tones, with a PG label. The real conditions in the extermination camps were unspeakably brutal. Only death and disease prevailed there. The Holocaust is very recent to not be considered a taboo. In principle, no subject in the world is too sacred or hideous to be dramatized. But I did avoid watching Benigni's comedy until my daughters insisted that I took them. I say, I'm an incurable romantic who was somehow vaccinated against motivational instances.
Movies like AMÃ©lie Poulain, American Beauty, Bad Santa, Big Fish, Breakfast On Pluto, Chocolate, The Hangover, Up, Sex and the City, Rushmore, Precious, Koyaanisqatsi, I definitely didn't like them (I even hated some of the more glaring cases, like Motorcycle Diaries for instance, a mistifying apology for false benefactors of mankind)
On the other hand, there were genuine sincerity and romanticism exuded from movies like Groundhog Day, Babette's Feast, The curious case of Benjamin Button, Once, Midnight Express, Midnight Cowboy, and above all from a masterpiece such as It's a Wonderful Life.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
sentimental slop,"This ""sentimental slop"", hardly registering any intelligence, is considered a ""masterpiece"" and received numerous vapid awards, notably from powerful Jewish groups and pompous film festivals. It is both ineffective as a film and as a critique against clichÃ©d injustice.I can't believe how empty it was, it starts out in a comedic manner, but it is absent of any laughs. The direction throughout was haphazard and even tedious. The ""evil"" Germans were cardboard caricatures who were so clichÃ©d that they didn't even seem to exhibit any movement in the film.Its obvious this film was some attempt to portray the magical realism of early Italian films with a pressing new concern for so-called ""ethics"" but is biased, immature and intangible. It is another ""holocaust"" as collective conscience film that wants to hammer its obtuse point across.Be weary of such films as they want to present everything in simplistic 'black and white"" formulations.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Such a beautiful movie!,"This moving had me in tears, but also made me smile. The little boy in the movie is so cute. The love that the father has for his son is indescribable. No matter how scared the father was, or how bad things got, he made sure his son was happy. Even when he knew he was going to die, he smiled at his son, and made him laugh. Absolutely full of love this movie is!He showed not one bit of fear in front of his son. I was in awe when I watched this movie. There is no way I could have been so strong for anyone like that. I can only imagine how frightened it must have been back then for those people, as things like this used to happen. Yet I doubt that many would have had the strength that this father had. So sad, yet so beautiful! I definitely want to see this movie again someday soon, even just to remind me about the most important things in life, like the people you love, and not the materialistic things in life, which aren't important. It's definitely a good movie to watch when your going through a rough time, like if you've just lost your job, or had your heart broken, or if your fighting with a friend or family member. It makes you feel grateful and appreciate your life, as things could be a lot worse. I know I was going through a rough time when I watched this movie. I felt so much better afterwards. I was just so grateful that I have a roof over my head, I wasn't in any danger, I have food to eat, a warm bed to sleep in, and other luxuries such as a TV, hot water and electricity, and clean clothes to where, just to name a few. It definitely made me realise that no matter how bad things get, other people have been through much worse, and would give anything to have the life that I have. Watching this movie also made me realise how much gratitude can make you happy. Like, feeling grateful, makes you feel happy. Much better than feeling hard done by, which makes you feel depressed!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"Roberto Benigni delivers a heartwarming and heartbreaking performance in the cinematic gem, ""Life Is Beautiful""","""Life Is Beautiful"" is a cinematic masterpiece that manages to strike the perfect balance between humor and heart-wrenching drama. Roberto Benigni's direction and performance are nothing short of brilliant as he portrays a father's unyielding love for his family in the most trying of circumstances.Set during the Holocaust, the film tells the story of Guido (Roberto Benigni) and his family as they are sent to a concentration camp. Guido's quick wit and humor provide a shield of protection for his young son, Giosue, and help him to believe that the whole experience is just a game. Despite the horrors that surround them, Guido manages to keep Giosue's spirits high and maintain his innocence.The performances by the entire cast are exceptional, with Benigni's Oscar-winning turn as Guido standing out. His comedic timing is impeccable, and he brings a vulnerability and sincerity to the role that is both heartwarming and heartbreaking.The film's themes of hope, love, and the power of imagination are universal and resonate with audiences of all ages and backgrounds. The cinematography is also stunning, capturing the beauty and brutality of the concentration camp.Overall, ""Life Is Beautiful"" is a cinematic gem that deserves all the praise it has received. It's a film that will make you laugh, cry, and leave you with a sense of hope that even in the darkest of times, love can still triumph.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

"Good, but not quite as great as I remembered","Usually I like a movie more on a rewatch, but it's been a good decade or so since I first watched this and it's not quite as good as I remembered... though of course, I do still like it a lot.Whereas I remembered thinking it walked the various lines between tragedy, comedy, fairytale-ish fantasy, and harsh realism excellently, now I think it pulls off balancing so many tones just pretty well. However, if you step back and look at the premise of the movie, the fact that it balances such moods and emotions to any extent at all is something of a miracle.I don't think it ever becomes offensive to have the main character protect his child from the horrors of a concentration camp through humour and fantasy, but I can understand why some viewers might think it goes too far. There are contrivances, there are some pacing issues (it kind of feels like they were in the camp for three days? Whereas I'm sure it was supposed to be longer), and that ending kind of works, but is also a little abrupt in a way that feels a bit off, and doesn't quite have the punch I remember.Funnily enough, the first half is the one I like better, whereas before, it was the second. Seeing a society on the brink of WW2 and the changes taking place is always really interesting. It's basically the premise of Cabaret, and also a big part of another film I watched recently called The Cremator. In Life is Beautiful, that stuff is more subtle than the broader emotional beats in the second half, and funnily enough, I find it more affecting, these 9-10 years later.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

A heartbreaking tale told with love,"I've never been bothered by subtitles as many people are. In fact, not understanding the language in a film causes me to pay more attention to details I might otherwise overlook.This film brought me to tears as a loving father tries his best to care for a young son while being held prisoner's in a concentration camp. The boy is too young to understand what's going on and his father does his best to convince his son they're on an adventure, playing a game. It's a tough game and at times you can see the father falter. This film is filled with pain and you'll hope and pray for the best possible outcome. I watched with disbelief as my heart pounded against my chest. It was a very emotional film, but there are plenty of times I had to smile. It's so well worth watching, I hope you give it a try. Even after all the madness, I was left repeating to myself.. Life IS Beautiful... because of people like this father, Guido.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
One of the most beautiful movies i've ever watched.,"Life is beautiful is probably the most creative and unique film that's ever been produced. It's wonderful, sad, funny and extremely innovative. Never in my mind would i think humor, imagination, World War Two and The Holocaust would work together in in the slighest bit, let alone create such a powerful masterpiece. The infusion of comedy and imagination in this film is absoulutely outstanding and i don't think we'll ever see a film like this ever again.Roberto Benigni not only creates a beautiful story as a director, he also deliver's a truly fantastic performance. This is to date one of the most powerful performances in cinema history. Roberto Benigni portrays the father who uses his humor and imagination to protect his young boy GiosuÃ© from the horrors of the holocaust. The moral story is that the most unnecessary is sometimes the most necessary.This movie is so beautiful, extremely heartwarming, unbearably sad and terrificly powerful. It's one of the most unique movies ever, it's THE best foreign language film ever and a must watch masterpiece.One of the greatest movies of all time and of course a perfect score.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

This Film Is Beautiful,"I laughed, I cried, and could not stop. Half love story- half-Holocaust drama- this is Roberto Benigni's masterpiece and he deserved all the recognition he got. An amazing experience of a film.I was especially taken with the sheer humanity of the story, and the way Benigni told it while not compromising his role as actor. There is a whimsy to the love story, and a dark humor to the drama. It's a sad but brave film about survival, humor, and the amazing power of love. It is an experience to behold, and to see again. There is a reason why Benigni was so excited to win, for he had a winning film, and while I may not understand Italian, I was taken with the romance of this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Showing the terrors of the Holocaust in a very special way,"""La vita e bella"" is not so much a film that is playing down the holocaust, as a film that plays tribute to the ability of men to survive or sacrifice oneself in the most difficult circumstances.Roberto Benigni is obviously indebted to ""The great dictator"" (1940, Charlie Chaplin). In effect my admiration for the last mentioned film is even greater, because it was made when the scale of the Nazi cruelties was not yet known.I was a little puzzled by the presence of German soldiers in Italy. Were they not allies? Yes they were, but after the fall of Mussolini in 1943 he was put back on the throne by Hitler. By that time Mussolini was but a vassal of Nazi Germany.Finally a few words about the form of the film and the visual language used. In a moving scene Guido (the male lead character) is communicating to his wife (who is in the women department of the camp) by means of classical music. In ""The Shawshank redemption"" (1994, Frank Darabont) there is a similar scene in which Andy communicaties with his fellow inmates with the use of classical music.Worth mentioning is also the (earlier) scene in which Guido walks into a greenhouse, very much in love with his wife. The next moment we see a five year s old kid walking out of that same greenhouse. The time lapse is incomparably smaller than in the fames scene with the bone in ""2001: a space odyssey"" (1968, Stanley Kubrick), but the idea is noteworthy still the same.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
