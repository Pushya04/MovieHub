The Wizard of Oz,"Fantastic tale about a Kansas farm girl who's spirited off to the wondrous land of Oz. The film still tingles with freshness and beauty. Garland is forever memorable as Dorothy Gale, the young girl and the supporting performances of Bolger, Lahr,Haley, Hamilton and Morgan are all stand out and will remain national treasures. The superb songs of E.Y. Harburg and Harold Arlen are still beautifully blended with the lovely photography, cinematography and art direction. Unforgettable!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A HUGE classic everyone should see,"This movie is creative, original, and very watchable. I first saw it 25 years ago. I was about 10 years old. I still find myself watching it every time it's on TV. It's not supposed to be realistic(obviously). It's filled with metaphors and meaning. Here's some trivia that can be missed. Repeated viewing reveals that the 3 characters that Dorothy meets are based on 3 people she knows. They are seen earlier in the movie, and are played by the same people. When re-watching, their early dialog becomes more note-worthy.The music is VERY memorable. And the movie has a very popular catch phrase everyone's heard many times. Also, there was a play on PBS in '95 based on the movie and I loved it. It starred Jewel and Roger Daltry as the Tin man and he ROCKed - literally. It was classic. I like how the audience laughing added to the play. It's out on VHS.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Perhaps the most well known and watched film in history?,"This film predates my birth by 19 years, so I've seen it as a child when it was an annual event on network TV, stretched out to hours in length, believably due to commercials and maybe not so believably today due to the network hosting and talking about the film a little during breaks.Today at age 55, when it shows up on Turner Classic Movies, even though I have in my possession the deluxe ""Wizard of Oz DVD Set and Museum in a Box"", I'll still stop and watch it from whatever point I catch it to the end. Having the advantage of having seen it at all ages I can truly say that it has enough fantasy and whimsy and spectacle to keep the interest of children without being inane so that adults cannot appreciate it too. I think in all of filmdom only Walt Disney in Walt's time with his animated features and Pixar in modern times have been able to strike that balance. Even ""Star Wars"" has lost a step or two in the 36 years since its release.Wizard of Oz has the universal themes of the value of friendship and family, of how many of us have strengths and virtues inside of us we'll never believe we have until tested, and how many powerful people are literally all hot air. ""Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain"" is practically a slogan of American politics as I am writing this in the year 2013. Then there is beautiful Judy Garland when her exterior still matched her voice, before the studio system chewed her up and literally spit her out. She was never more lovely than she is right here. You'd never believe Billie Burke as the good witch Glenda is 55 years old. You'd never believe that Margaret Hamilton as The Bad Witch is only 37. I remember seeing her on a daytime commercial in the 1960's as a child and thinking ""Isn't she dead yet?"" There is maybe one aspect of this film that is uniquely pre-WWII. The theme of the film - ""Never look for anything if you can't find it in your own backyard"" is a motto for the isolationist years between the wars that would be left behind in only a couple of years when it became apparent that the U.S. would have to confront the evil expansionist powers growing on both sides of the globe. It is perhaps a unique snapshot in time in that regard only. It also shows the best the studio system could produce in that fabled year of 1939 when it was at the height of its power.Forgive me for yammering on about a film that has been reviewed hundreds of times, but this one will always have a special place in my heart and my memory.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Late-Comer,"I was born the same year the movie came out, but only caught up with it the other night, mainly because musicals are not my usual movie fare. So what's left to say after 500+ reviews. I was most impressed by the art and set direction. Too bad they didn't win Oscars. The sets were so imaginative and well done, from poppy fields to enchanted woods to yellow brick road.For once, MGM's habit of over-producing what's on screen really paid off with an appropriately lavish scale. The effects are simply breathtaking, but I can also detect the nightmarish visuals that go beyond the demonic Witch of the West. So I can see why kids would be both mesmerized and unsettled by the fantastic adventures.I also have to say that Garland was wonderful as Dorothy, though I've never been a particular fan. Plus, her captivating rendition of Rainbow deserves to top the all-time movie charts. All in all, I'm sorry it took me so long to catch up. It's really hard to believe that so many cooks (writers & directors) didn't spoil the outcome. Somehow, the sumptuous production with its sturdy moral all came together, and remains aptly a movie for the ages.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A true cinematic milestone,"Where to begin? MGM's elaborate adaptation of L. Frank Baum's 1900 fantasy classic THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ not only became an institution among itself (and practically defined the concept of modern popular culture), but is reported to be the most viewed film ever made. A sharp screenplay effectively condenses the novel's text into a workable film, and director Victor Fleming (along with countless other behind-the-scenes technicians) craft a visually stimulating fantasy world that surpasses the expectations of even the most imaginative viewers. Brimming with stunning visual effects (the film's fierce tornado is an FX feat that has yet to be surpassed by CGI), witty dialogue, and eye-popping Technicolor, THE WIZARD OF OZ truly lives up to it's reputation as a once-in-a-lifetime film where every element comes together flawlessly.The cast could not be improved upon. The quivery-voiced, solemn-faced Judy Garland will always be Dorothy, the little lost farm girl on the road to Oz, clutching her beloved Toto (impressively portrayed himself by the female canine performer Terry, the terrier). It seems inconceivable that MGM had originally wished to cast Shirley Temple in the role, as Temple's doe-eyed, cutesy-voiced shtick would have been a catastrophic ill-fit for the tone of this picture. Conversely, Garland is perhaps the screen's quintessential woman/child; always seemingly just one step away from reaching full emotional maturity. It is her sadness that transfixes viewers to the screen, the exact same quality that made the film's most memorable Harold Arlen/E. Y. Harburg number ""Over the Rainbow"" into one of the most exquisite marriages between artist and song ever to be recorded.The remainder of the cast is similarly exceptional, many of whom perform perfectly even under the most debilitating make-up and costumes. Frank Morgan is marvelously versatile in no less than five roles, the insanely energetic Bert Lahr mugs brilliantly, the handsome Jack Haley swoons sweetly, Billie Burke lends the film an ornate ethereality, and Ray Bolger's gravity-defying physical presence nearly steals the entire picture on several occasions. Perhaps most notable is former schoolteacher Margaret Hamilton's transformation into the wickedest of wicked witches, which certainly remains among the vilest and most terrifying portrayals of full-throttle evil ever to be seen. No matter how it is analyzed, scrutinized, or satirized, the 1939 production of THE WIZARD OF OZ is a top-notch example of how to turn a great story into a fabulous, milestone of a film.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Timeless classic still entertaining the masses as each new generation comes in.,"Dorothy is a young girl living on a Kansas farm, during a tornado, she, along with her dog Toto, is swept up and plonked down in a magical and mysterious land known as Oz. Desperate to get back home and under threat from a wicked witch, she is advised to seek out a great wizard who should be able to help her get back home. As she sets off and on her way, she meets and befriends a wonderful array of characters whom also have something to ask of the fabled wizard. It's a journey that will prove to be both magical and fraught with danger.The Wizard Of Oz is a film that has been pored over and dissected from almost everyone involved in the wonderful world of film. One thing that strikes me every time I view it is that there not only is no place like home, there is also no film like The Wizard Of Oz, and really, when all is said and done, there is unlikely to be another film of its ilk to ever grace the silver screen. Upon multiple viewings only the most biased of film fan could say that it is a technically perfect picture, it clearly isn't, for at times it's a wee bit creaky and when scrutinised, some of the performances in the piece are far from being of an excellent standard. Crucially, though, any misgivings are quickly erased due to the utter wonder of it all, you see this is because the film has a beguiling ability to transport everybody who is watching it and slot them into OZ alongside Dorothy.The Wizard Of Oz appeals (and caters) to every demographic and pretty much any age group, we have adventure, the meeting of new friends, fears and trepidations, booming colour, songs to singalong with, and of course the total crux point of homely values. The Wizard Of Oz stands up well 80 years later because it taps into all the emotions available to the human being. Be it a young child spellbound on a first viewing, or an octogenarian couple of grandparents wistfully humming along to the tunes, it's a film that shouldn't be dissected looking for faults and hidden meanings, it's a film that should be loved and praised for the ode to fantastical whimsy that it so obviously is.The film of course will forever be associated with its darling star, Judy Garland. Viewing now, and knowing what a sad life she would eventually lead, The Wizard Of Oz is a fitting picture on which to remember what a magical and wonderful performer she was. Myself as a lump of waning middle aged machismo, has no shame in saying that as Judy sings Somewhere Over The Rainbow I melt and feel as though I'm being sent spinning into another world, that's the power of the piece, because as a sepia Kansas becomes the glorious colour of Oz, nothing else in my world matters, I'm in hook line and sinker.There are many interesting back stories to the picture, with books galore available to anyone interested. Some notes that might interest you being the original castings to be W.C. Fields, Shirley Temple and Deanna Durbin, munchkins running riot, drunken cast members, sadness and suicides, and grizzled old pros fighting hard not to let Garland steal the picture. Well it makes for a great read, for sure, but what remains to this day is one of the most beloved pictures to have ever been made, for once in the pantheon of great cinema we have a film that is termed a classic, that actually deserves to have that tag!One of the great things about the advent of technology is that it can benefit old classic movies to make them better, for now we can view remastered editions of The Wizard Of Oz and appreciate even more what a great job the makers did. Keep your eyes on Dorothy's Ruby Slippers during the film and see how they are the sparkling important character that they should be, or take in the brilliant work of the make up crew, the tiniest of rivets on The Tin Man a testament to the brilliant work that goes into bringing magic to our lives. Get the newest copy you can and then also see it on the biggest screen available to you because The Wizard Of Oz is a 10/10 movie. And then some.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A cinematic achievement that never truly grows old.,"""You have no power here! Begone, before somebody drops a house on you, too!""It seems a little silly to be writing a review of The Wizard of Oz. It's the movie that's been seen by more people than any other in history. Most of us have seen it 10 times by the time we're seven. But I'll put my two cents in anyway, from an adult's point of view.As a kid, I thought the munchkins were slightly creepy and the winged monkeys much more so, but I loved Dorothy and I loved the songs, and the entire movie was just so bright and colorful that I find it hard to believe that any kid could dislike it. Now, at the age of 25, I can still recognize the merit of it, without being influenced much by a lasting nostalgia. The Wizard of Oz is a lot like Alice in Wonderland (my all-time favorite children's novel), it treats children like they're smart and clever and capable of understanding and handling ideas that sometimes we adults forget they can get a handle on. The danger and excitement of The Wizard of Oz is a true adventure, be it a candy-coated one.I can also better appreciate now the staggering amount of work and creativity that went into bringing this novel to life. It's just remarkable, really. The choreography, the classic songs, the sets, the costumes, the special effects, they're all still impressive today. More so, really, because many of the tools used to make modern movie magic weren't available back then. And Judy Garland...really, what needs to be said about her that isn't blindingly and extraordinarily obvious? No one else could have been Dorothy Gale.It was nice to revisit this once again, and while some of my childhood adoration for The Wizard of Oz may be gone, my admiration for it still remains.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A magical experience.,"Young Dorothy runs away from home with her dog Toto, after a tornado hits, she's transported to the magical world of Oz.It is such an uplifting, magical escape, it is no wonder this film is loved by so many, all age groups, it really does survive the ages.It really is an enchanting story, and in terms of its importance in the film industry, it was a game changer, audiences must have been left speechless when this first landed.1939, and it still looks remarkably good, the scenes where the tornado hits look fantastic, considering the technological restraints, it looks particularly good.Judy Garland is delightful throughout, Margaret Hamilton is a riot as The Wicked Witch of The West. The performances are all so good.The music is so well known, so uplifting, and at times pretty moving.I wonder if they even considered for one second that their movie would be loved decades later.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
You should never believe that this movie is from the 30',"First of all i want to say sorry for my English!For a few days ago I watch Victor Flemmings ""Gone With the Wind"".

It deserve the 2 Academy Awards it has won for Best Music, Original Song and Best Music, Original Score.I found the film pretty funny with all the different character.

Flawless,"The most difficult thing about reviewing The Wizard of Oz is finding something to say about it that doesn't begin with ""the best."" It's hard to argue that this isn't a strong contender for the greatest movie of all time. Navel-gazing dramas about the human condition are fine, and I know most critics' lists would give preference to those sorts of films, but this movie has a little bit of everything and is easily among the most perfect films ever made. It doesn't matter if you're a kid or a grown-up. The Wizard of Oz is a timeless classic that has appeal for every open-hearted person out there. It's full of iconic lines, songs, characters, and moments. It's had a cultural impact few films do. So many things from the film have made their way into our everyday lives and language. If I had to single out one thing about it I love more than the memorable characters played by an ideal cast, exuberant Arlen & Harburg songs, delightful story, and beautiful sets, costumes, and matte painting backdrops, it would be the vibrant and rich Technicolor. It's such a gorgeous looking movie. Funny, sentimental, sincere -- it's a masterpiece that I've been in love with since I was a little kid. I've never grown tired of it and I hope I never do.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Too bad no one sees the whole version anymore,"If you watch the TV version, you are truly missing out on one of the most important connections to be made. We all know why the farm hands played the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion, but do you know why DOrothy sees MIss Gulch as the Wicked Witch of the West? In the version broadcast in the 50's the movie opened with Dorothy walking home from school as the current version hints at. What viewers don't see today is that Toto wondered off into Miss Gulch's garden and was chased out by MIss Gulch with a broom. She threatens to take the dog or at least report Dorothy and Toto to the Sheriff, which she eventually does. DOrothy runs from Miss Gulch toward the farm and when she reaches the entrance road to the farm, the new broadcast version picks up the story. I understand or was led to believe that this portion of the film was edited for TV broadcast and lost in a fire forever. I consider it to be one of the most important parts of the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Still Has Its Magic,"Judy Garland's portrayal of Dorothy, Dorothy's oddball Oz friends, ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"", and the rest of this fine production of ""The Wizard of Oz"" have lost little of their magic over the years. While it has become oddly fashionable in recent years to deride this kind of classic, innocent fantasy, the movie itself has aged very well, and it is likely to retain an appreciative audience for some time to come.There's no doubt that part of the appeal of the story and the characters comes from them being such old friends to so many cinema fans, but there are also good reasons why they have endured for so long, and have been able to hold up even after becoming so familiar. Although Dorothy is not a particularly complex character, she represents an innocent but deep yearning that is easy to identify with. Likewise, the 'Oz' characters are bizarre enough to remain interesting, but there is a core of substance that again is easy to believe in. Who does not feel that he or she could use at least one of the things that Dorothy's friends want?The adaptation from the original story is done quite well, making fine choices for the characters and episodes that would work on film. The settings and visual effects may not impress the devotees of today's computer imagery, but in their time they certainly demonstrated a great deal of skill and planning, and even now, in their own way they are more believable than are most of the computer tricks that have become so overused.The popular story has also been used for a number of more recent adaptations, and some of them have had some good points of their own. But this Wizard remains by far the most wonderful of the versions of the classic tale.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

My childhood favourite!,"I am 16, and I still love this movie. I grew up watching this, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and Meet Me in Saint Louis, and I never tire of them. Judy Garland is wonderful as Dorothy, bringing a sense of vulnerability and sadness to the role, making Over The Rainbow more poignant than it already was. Ray Bolger, Jack Haley and Bert Lahr are really entertaining as her three friends. Billie Burke as Glinda, and the Munchkins were great fun too. The wicked witch of the west scared the life out of me here and still does, and even Frank Morgan does 5 roles to great comical effect. The songs are just fabulous, and so is the cinematography and the stunning scenery. True, the film isn't completely faithful to the book, but why does it have to be? If I had one minor drawback, it would be the singing voice of the Lion, but apart from that, this movie is a must-see! 10/10. Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not Really a Friend of Dorothy,"During the British general election of 1983, the centrist Social Democratic Party mocked their political rivals by depicting Margaret Thatcher as the Tin Man and Labour leader Michael Foot as the Scarecrow from ""The Wizard of Oz"". The accompanying caption read ""One hasn't got a heart; the other hasn't got a brain"". Unfortunately, they appear to have forgotten that Dorothy had three companions, not two, and it was quickly suggested by both Conservative and Labour supporters that the SDP leader Roy Jenkins- a politician often accused by his opponents of lacking any convictions to have the courage of- must therefore be the Cowardly Lion.I mention this story because it shows how deeply this film has become a part of popular culture, so much so that a reference to it was readily understood by voters at an election more than forty years after it was made. If anything, the story is even more familiar today than it was in 1983, following repeated television showings (normally during the Christmas holidays) and the opening of an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical based on it. In Britain at least, its fame has eclipsed that of the novel on which it is based. The story is so well-known that I won't try to summarise it here, except to say that, like ""Alice in Wonderland"", it deals with the adventures of a young girl in a bizarre fantasy world.The film is not only well-known, it is also highly regarded; it frequently features in lists of the ""100 Greatest Movies Ever Made"". (Sometimes even the ""10 Greatest Movies Ever Made""). Certainly, it has its good points. Ray Bolger's Scarecrow, Jack Haley's Tin Man and Bert Lahr's camp Lion are all inspired comic creations, as is Margaret Hamilton's Wicked Witch of the West, although several of her scenes were cut because the studio thought that they would frighten young children. There is some imaginative use of colour- the bright, vivid colours during the Oz scenes would doubtless seem unbearably hectic and strident in any realistic film, but in a film set in a fantasy world they fit in with the strange, dreamlike mood. The use of monochrome for the real world and colour for imaginary ones became something of a cliché in fantasy movies after this, although Michael Powell was to reverse this convention to brilliant effect in ""A Matter of Life and Death"".The casting of the teenaged Judy Garland as Dorothy (supposedly a nine-year-old) made sense from a musical point of view, as she copes far better with the demands of the film's numerous songs than any child actress could have done, but children in the audience might have found it easier to identify with the character had she been played by someone closer to their own age. (Shirley Temple, six years younger than Garland, was at one time considered for the part). As an actor, as opposed to a singer, Garland's performance in this film is nothing special, but that may have more to do with the way her character is written. Dorothy is essentially a passive character who acts as straight woman to a series of comic ones. Some of the other acting contributions are not very good, particularly Billie Burke's rather wooden Glinda, the Good Witch of the North. Given that Glinda is supposed to be young and beautiful, it seemed rather odd to cast an actress in her fifties in this particular role.The film was originally intended as a children's movie, although I don't think it works very well as one. This may have been the reason why it was a box office failure in 1939; its subsequent fame has been due to repeated broadcasts on television and its taking on the status of an adult cult. When we were taken to see it as children, my younger sister was terrified by the witch and I was bored, especially during those sepia-and-white scenes in Kansas. Some of the songs, such as ""Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead"" and ""We're Off to See the Wizard"" are jolly enough to appeal to children, but ""Over the Rainbow"", sentimental corn-syrup in its purest form, has always struck me, both as a child and as an adult, as one of the most over-rated songs ever written.Most children's films from this period had to have an improving moral, and ""The Wizard of Oz"" has two. The first- that one must look inside oneself for qualities such as intelligence, kindliness and courage- is unexceptionable, but the other, ""There's no place like home"", seems rather parochial, even un-American, given that America is a country of immigrants, most of whom moved to the New World precisely because they couldn't, for one reason or another, find their heart's desire in their original homelands.I must confess that I am not really a Friend of Dorothy. It is not that I hate the film, or even seriously dislike it. It is simply that, like another reviewer, I cannot understand why it is so often mentioned in the same breath as genuinely great films like ""Gone with the Wind"", ""Casablanca"" or ""Citizen Kane"". I am prepared to accept ""The Wizard of Oz"" as a colourful, imaginative and at times enjoyable piece of fantasy. I just can't see it as one of the Greatest Movies of All Time. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Movie that left mark on countless generations,"This is one of those movies that will last forever. Our grandmothers were watching it while they were just little girls and our grandchildren will enjoy it as much. Its values will never be outdated. One of those that define expression ""classic"". Only a shallow viewer could consider it to be just a fairy-tale for children, because this masterpiece is much more than that and its depth covers all generations. Although it's almost 80 years old it still resists the teeth of time, even visually. Its costumes and special effects are extremely outdated but still effective.

But I have to admit that this movie doesn't really serve my personal taste, even for a family movie.

Oz is that place somewhere over the rainbow,"'The Wizard of Oz' is a very old movie and looks awfully dated, but still has its magic and charm. To this day it still has many fans, which is a surprise for a movie this old.The sceneries/backgrounds and special effects don't impress by today's standards, but they must have caused great impact back in 1939. Plus, some of the special effects are astonishing for the time. Look at that tornado, for example! It just seems so real! Amazing that they could do something like that in such primitive times.Speaking of the sceneries, they are full of creative and details which create this childish world of fantasy (the land of Oz). Looking at all those sceneries and to what people dress, it almost reminds me about those childish theater plays I used to see during my childhood. The yellow brick road and the Emerald City are just two among many creative and imaginative details of this movie.The characters are as original as much as they are odd and unusual. The most bizarre characters are the army of flying monkeys, the Winkie Guards, the Wicked Witch of the East, the Munchkins, the talking trees and the Gatekeeper. The Scarecrow, the Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion are less weird, but still unusual. Dorothy and her cute dog Toto, Professor Marvel, Hunk, Zeke, Hickory, Auntie Em, Uncle Henry and the Wizard of Oz are normal characters.Of all the 3 strange friends of Dorothy, the Scarecrow is my favorite. He is the funniest of them, even though the silly Cowardly Lion is hilarious.To a degree, I can see why this movie is considered a classic. It consistently appears in the lists of the greatest movies ever. It is much praised and regarded by many people. It gets generally high ratings. Does it really deserve to be as venerated as it is? Well, it's all a matter of tastes. But despite its charm and magic, there are things of discussable taste in this movie, such as the bizarre characters which become tiring after many viewings. Certain scenes are also somewhat dark and sinister for a kids's movie.The songs are simple but jolly and charming, such as ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"", ""We're Off to See the Wizard"", ""If I Only Had a Brain"" (in this last case, including its related songs) and my favorite: the wonderful opening music. I don't like the songs sung by the Munchkins because of their weird voices.Although the movie is beyond dated and obsolete nowadays, it was nevertheless advanced for its time, thanks to the special effects and the fact that it is a sepia-toned black-and-white film in the Kansas sequences and a fully colored one (Technicolor) in the Oz sequences.The actors are generally good in their roles. The best are Frank Morgan (who portrays a total of 5 roles in the film), Ray Bolger (as the Scarecrow and Hunk) and Judy Garland (as Dorothy Gale).Filming was a nightmare. And yet the movie would become a lasting legacy, even though that was uncertain at the time.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A Wiz of a film, if ever a Wiz there was","The NBC Peacock began unfolding its wings.  ""The following program is brought to you in living color--with portions in black & white--on NBC."" That exclusive intro began my exposure to color television at Grandma's in 1968.  When Dorothy stepped out into Technicolor, I'll bet my eyes just popped.This is the Movie of All Time, folks--a status achieved during its long run as a huge annual TV event during that classic era whose programs now show up on TV Land network.  In the 1970s, Peter Marshall once read the answer on Hollywood Squares as to the program seen more times by more people than anything else ever shown on television.  It was ""Oz.""  Likewise, no movie has the hold on popular culture that this one does.  What lion character ever since (i.e., Snagglepuss) hasn't been an impersonation of Bert Lahr going, ""Put 'em up, put 'em uuuuup!""Few musicals offer an equal combination of lovable music and engaging story. Perhaps ""The Sound of Music.""  Hard to think of many Hollywood musicals where the story gets as serious as it does here when the Witch informs Dorothy that, ""The last to go will see the first three go before her...and her mangy little dog too!""  Yikes!  In contrast, even the best of other Hollywood musicals seem to serve up fluffy, forgettable story lines that are mere backdrop to the song numbers that typically put the plot on hold.I can't say that ""Oz"" doesn't have technical flaws or story element inconsistencies.  It's just that the astonishing production values all around so overwhelm the shortcomings.  The tornado sequence is a 1939 special effects tour de force--incredible.  And the Nutcracker-quality musical score offers songs tastefully interwoven with the action.  Certain numbers like ""Merry Old Land of Oz,"" I never get tired off, though I like each of the songs.Oz should be viewed in the lightness of spirit that it deserves.  I mean look, we have Frank Morgan as the Emerald City gatekeeper, then seconds later as the cabbie with the Horse of a Different Color, then the Wizard's palace guard, and then the voice of fire-and-smoke Wizard of Oz who bellows, ""Step forward, Tin Man!""  What other film could put an actor go through 4 quick-changes within 10 minutes to such an endearing result?  ""Oz"" is as magic as those sparkling ruby shoes.The early Technicolor process utilized triple nitrate negative strips--separately recording each primary color in light.  This was done due to the lack of a suitable ""color film"" in 1939.  That would quickly change--but films from years following suffered from hues that faded with the years, even original negatives.  Because ""Oz"" was actually filmed on a black-and-white base film, the negatives never faded.  So now we have home videos/DVDs of breathtaking color quality.  Now, the tinted filters in the cameras that separated the colors onto the negative strips meant that intense illumination was required, rendering the filming experience miserably hot for the actors involved, especially Lahr.  But they all hold up amazingly well.""Oz"" has a valuable message.  As the pop group America once said, ""No, Oz never did give nothin' to the Tin Man....that he didn't, didn't already have.""  If we have truly search, we can find within us--or create through trial, like the Lion's courage--what we think we most lack.  The Wizard (like the Lord) helps those who find help within themselves.I feel sorry for the Almira Gulches who can't treasure this film experience. They need to visit the Emerald City to get their own ticking Testimonials and find their hearts.Didn't bring your broomsticks with you?  Well, I'm afraid you'll have to walk.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Will continue to enthrall for generations to come!,"One of the most cherished fantasy films to ever grace the screen, ""The Wizard of Oz"" stands as a crowning achievement in 1930's film making. The special effects are highly impressive considering the limited technology available at the time, not to mention they are infinitely more endearing than most CGI effects present in today's films. The lavish sets, impeccable costume design, and glowing Technicolor help to create a convincing and enchanting Land of Oz. And though obviously filmed on a soundstage, the sets never seem confining; thanks largely in part to the meticulous backdrop paintings used to add depth to the foreground. The musical numbers are quite lively & catchy -- never slowing the pace of the film -- except perhaps for the Lion singing ""King of the Jungle"". Judy Garland truly shines in her portrayal of Dorothy, perfectly capturing the wide-eyed innocence of her character. She definitely deserved the special Oscar she was awarded for her performance. Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch of the West, Ray Bolger as the Scarecrow, and Frank Morgan as the Wizard also turn in praiseworthy characterizations. Definitely timeless in every sense of the word, this film is recommended to those of all ages  a 10/10!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantasy Classic,"The Wizard of Oz is a long time favorite of mine. One I used to watch every Easter with my family. It is a delightful classic film.This film I believe most all movie watchers have seen and have drawn their own conclusions as to whether or not they like the film.I know of hard-core blood and gore fans that enjoys The Wizard of Oz due to it's darker tones (witches, wizards and evil flying monkeys). And there are others that I know of that prefer a more ""wholesome"" style to their films which include this movie. Really this film brings together people who are basically different from each other - from hard-cores all the way to wholesome - not many movies have this capability.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Timeless,"In the fall of 2006, my husband and I saw a screening ""The Wizard of Oz"" that had a full orchestra providing the soundtrack. Never in my life had I seen a more eclectic audience: there were families with little children, adults who came alone (one woman was dressed as Glinda), teens and college students, even couples who had to have been in their '90s. Not to gush, but it's really a testimonial to ""Oz""'s legacy that it can appeal to every generation, to every age. Like hot chocolate or Mickey Mouse T-shirts, ""The Wizard of Oz"" is something you never have to worry about being too old for. There is something so comforting about the familiar story of farm girl Dorothy's journey through the strange but wonderful land of Oz, and yet it remains a wonder to behold. I still get excited when Dorothy steps out her sepia-toned world of Kansas into the Technicolor Munchkinland, even though I learned ages ago how the trick was done. I'm still overjoyed when Dorothy makes another odd yet loyal friend along her journey (hmmm, a nice message of tolerance, too!). I still cry when Dorothy bids her friends farewell (Jack Haley in particular breaks my heart). I just want to yell at the screen, ""no! Forget boring old Kansas, stay in Oz!""Not only is ""The Wizard of Oz"" a charming, addictive classic, but it's one of the best-cast films ever. Putty-limbed Ray Bolger (""Some people without brains do and AWFUL lot of talking, don't they?""), over-the-top Bert Lahr (I haven't any courage at all, I even scare myself!""), and boyishly charming Jack Haley (""Now I know I have a heart, 'cause it's breaking."") are pitch-perfect in their respective roles as the Scarecrow, the Cowardly Lion, and the Tin Man. All three were vaudeville vets, and they infuse their roles with both theatrical shtick and warmth. Billie Burke is memorably twittery yet poised as Glinda the Good Witch, and who can possibly forget Margaret Hamilton's cackling, gleefully evil performance as the Wicked Witch of the West? Hamiltion's iconic, villainous image is so emblazoned in our minds, that it's easy to forget she was a former kindergarten teacher and future animal rights activist! As superb as the cast is, however, ""The Wizard of Oz"" belongs to the young Judy Garland. Garland makes Dorothy a very real character that we can all relate too, whereas any other actress would have made her one-note and whiny. She believably plays an ordinary girl in an extraordinary place, her lovely brown eyes wide with awe and wonder. And that singing voice! Long before Garland's voice became tinged with tremulous desperation due to age and hard living, the true beauty and purity of her voice comes through in ""Oz"". Garland sings ""Over the Rainbow"" so simply, without a trace of theatrics, and you're swept away just the same. It's spellbinding, seeing someone so young have the presence and talent to hold a movie in the palm of her hand. ""The Wizard of Oz"" will remain the ultimate escapist classic for generations to come, and it will always be one of my favorites. It's comforting, familiar, why... it's just like home.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Is, and always will be, a classic for all time!","In order to coincide with the upcoming ""Oz, the Great and Powerful"", I'm going to make my own review of this 1939 classic that will be celebrating it's 75th anniversary next year (not to mention the fact that it will be in IMAX 3D this year in September). I watched it when I was a little kid and loved it as much as anyone else in the film industry. Sure, it's not actually faithful to the book, but it doesn't matter.It did what it had set out to do and defined the meaning of a true Hollywood classic that inspired other acclaimed directors and filmmakers to do the same. The story is very original in the overall light-hearted tone, although it does have some moments that would make you feel scared(especially the Wicked Witch of the West who scared me as a little child). The scenery is beautiful and realistic and the look of the Emerald City is a sight to behold. The characters are charming and likable too. Judy Garland is a beautiful Dorothy, Ray Bolger is a terrific Scarecrow, Jack Haley is a wonderful Tin Man, Bert Lahr is a hilarious and cowardly Lion, and Margaret Hamilton is a scary Wicked Witch of the West.The pacing moves along very nicely, but the best part would have to go to the musical numbers written by Harold Arlen and E.Y. Yip Harbug including ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow"", ""Ding! Dong! The Wicked Witch Is Dead"", ""If I Only Had A Brain"", ""If I Only Had A Heart"", ""If I Only Had The Nerve"", ""We're Off To See The Wizard"", and more.Overall, The Wizard of Oz is, and always will be, a classic to those who are young and old. Recommended!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Pure Delight,"This movie is a pure delight. I remember back when I was young that it would come on television once a year and whenever it played it was like watching it for the very first time. It was both wonderful and magical. Even today it is a joy to watch and having seen it at least fifteen times that in and of itself is quite remarkable. At least for me. Be that as it may, I think it is important to inform new viewers that this movie was made back in 1939 and as a result it doesn't have the computer graphics or any of the technology used today to enhance the special effects. But what special effects it does have is still pretty good even by today's standards. Add in the music and performances of Judy Garland (as ""Dorothy""), Ray Bolger (the ""Scarecrow""), Bert Lahr (the ""Cowardly Lion""), and Jack Haley (the ""Tin Man"") and the end result is something that I don't believe can ever be duplicated. In short, not only is this movie a ""classic"" in every sense of the word but I believe it ranks in the top 3 films of all time. If you've never seen this movie then by all means you need to buy or rent it as soon as possible. You'll be glad you did.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"There's no place like home ... no time like childhood ... no movie like ""The Wizard of Oz"" ...","Red like magical ruby slippers, yellow like a brick road to follow, green like the Emerald city, blue like a cloudless sky, violet like a floppy field  all the colors of the rainbow celebrate two magical universes with the same initials: cinema and childhood.""The Wizard of Oz"" is and will forever be associated with a magnificent imagery, unforgettable songs such as ""Ding Dong! the Witch is Dead"", ""We're off to see the Wizard"", the catchy ""If I had..."" songs, the Munchkins' high-pitched voices, Dorothy having the feeling 'not to be in Kansas' anymore, the shrill and scary voice of a green-faced evil witch and so on and so forth. With all these elements, it's comforting that the film lost against a worthy adversary, the iconic ""Gone with the Wind"" from the same director. God, if there ever was a year where film-making triumphed, it's 1939, and the throne of Hollywood undoubtedly belonged to Victor Fleming.""The Wizard of Oz"" is both a spectacular milestone for its first use of colors and groundbreaking visual effects and a timeless classic in the way it touched the heart of children from many generations, all over the world. It's fascinating how these two aspects drive the film's paradoxical nature as the ultimate escapism, plunging us in the dreamlike Technicolor vision of the enchanted land of Oz, yet concluding with the immortal ""There's no place like home"". ""Oz"" captures through the innate power and insecurity of childhood a very poignant contradiction that reminds us how we used to dream of such places 'over the rainbow' and still were deeply rooted to our home, our family. And Kansas, with its sepia-like simplicity is Dorothy's home and we couldn't be happier for her when she was finally back.But as a set-up to this powerful finale, the whole film is a miraculous journey into a magical world where a group of friends will try to find the only person whose power could fulfill their wishes. Dorothy wants to go home, because she left her aunt worried after a frightening tornado destroyed the farm, the Scarecrow wants to have a brain, the Tin Man, a heart and needless to say what the Cowardly Lion wants. We all can identify with Dorothy or her friends because each one remains true to one of the many emotions that inhabit childhood, fear, awkwardness, joy, sadness, homesickness etc. And watching these three adult actors and an adolescent Judy Garland taking their roles with such dedication is the best tribute to the good old days' innocence. Those were the days ruled by Walt Disney and MGM's roaring lion, when people went to the movie theaters to escape, to dream  an even sadder desire when put in the tragic international context of the film.Speaking of my personal experience, I had ""The Wizard of Oz"" in mind long before watching the film, with the unforgettable image of Dorothy and her three friends walking along the ""We're off to see the Wizard"" song, one of these indelible shots in the history of film-making that invites us to re-enact them every once in a while. That's the secret of ""Oz"", which makes any attempt to summarize the film pointless. Any other fantasy film can be more spectacular or penetrating but its popularity might mostly rely on the story, on the way it ends. Take Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"", the whole significance of the film depends on the reception of the last act of the film, and kind of diminish the impact of the first scenes. In ""The Wizard of Oz"", it's all about characters, scenes, songs, quotes, each sequence is as valuable and impacting as another, and more than anything, each one conveys a valuable lesson about and for children.Whether it's about children's adoration for their pet animals (Dorothy's adventure starts because she wanted to protect her dog Toto from the evil Miss Gulch) or about the value of friendship in order to face the adversity of the adult world, an undeniable pedagogical value elevates ""Oz"" above all the other fantasy movies. It is, for once, not a coming-of-age, but a coming-to-realization story and a proud affirmation of the value of childhood in the way it intelligently mirrors our own memories of a time of misunderstanding, naivety, trust and fear and a perpetual leaning helping us to face the world, to accept it and moreover to accept ourselves (there's a subtle message about self-acceptance powerfully conveyed by the wizard, played by the jovial Frank Morgan). And the merit of these lessons is to be learned through action: Dorothy and her friends are never passive characters characters and that's crucial because it puts action as a necessary step before learning, and fear, not as a flaw, but a necessary step before learning about courage.""The Wizard of Oz"" provides also through the wizard's character, the man 'behind the curtain', a lesson about naivety and how child's eyes can easily trust or be impressed. In a way, it illustrates the sad reality that all the adults aren't trustworthy. Of course, some of them can be really mean and the film wouldn't have been half the masterpiece it is without the scene stealing performance of Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch of the West, rightfully nominated #4 in the AFI Top 50 villains. The Witch happens to be a representation of Mrs. Gulch in Dorothy's dream, like most of the characters, including the three friends (farmhands in real-life) and the wizard  in a way, it helps us to keep in mind that Dorothy is only dreaming, which doesn't make her dream less impacting anyway.And bizarrely, as we forget it's all a dream, we cease to be marveled by the beauty of the cinematography and the special effects, forgetting that it was before CGI, before ""Star Wars"", that's the miracle of ""The Wizard of Oz"", and as a beautiful dream, its memory can be eternal",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Very Enjoyable,"In my opinion, you can't deny that this is a classic movie. i don't know many people who haven't at least heard of it, and don't know many people who don't like it. I used to watch it every now and then when I was young, and I knew the words to quite a few of the songs. I hadn't seen it in a while, but, I still knew what I liked about it. When I was little, I used to be absolutely horrified of the Wicked Witch, and the Tin Man was my absolute favorite character. Since then, I am no longer afraid of the Wicked Witch at all; if anything, I just sort of hate her, because she's mean. I think that it is just a good movie through and through. It's very charming and colorful, has a good deal of humor, and you can sort of get sucked in to the story easily. Of course, they changed it a bit from the book, which only a few years ago, I didn't know about, but I much prefer the movie to the book. In conclusion, I think it's a great movie, that was a pretty big deal when it first came out, with the beauty of tis Technicolor, and that everyone should watch it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good fun to be had,"Rating-7/10The Wizard of Oz is a classic and many consider it to be one of the best movies ever made, I have to disagree. Now don't mistake me here it isn't bad at all, it is pretty good in my opinion but I just can't say I absolutely loved it. It has it's charm and for a child then maybe they would love it but I couldn't help feel I needed to be younger to view it with such a magical view. The story is however well timed and a good length for it's kind of film and felt the ending is one of the best parts of the movie.Now Judy Garland is great in this, and I'm not just saying that because it's her and because it's Wizard Of Oz, she is a great talent here and back in the day people must have been blown away by seeing her on the big screen. One element I absolutely loved about this was the music because that really is the highlight and produces such memorable songs you forgot were even from this film, just great great fun. It feels a bit strange at times the plot, maybe a bit too random to be properly assembled but maybe an hour after watching I personally felt joyous and filled with a happy like memory from watching the movie.The numerous directing changes don't help and although the finished product with Victor Fleming at the helm is strong, it can at parts feel messy. I didn't like the script and that is one the major reasons I can't see this as perfection, the lines are delivered well by most but the choices of wording are poor and anything like that done today would be classed as conventional and much seen before in musicals. I can't doubt the sheer mass of the cast for putting on a good show and even though the Munchkins are barely hear able with such high pitch voices, it is people like that who make this film what it is today.I think one big reason this is classed as so good is because of the big technological things seen in this and a new type of film that hadn't been seen before, and in such vivid colour. The sets are horrible and I mean nothing can be done about that for the times and although they are kind of sweet looking, nothing more positive can be said about the walls seen to create the backgrounds. One big thing technology wise that does work for me is the cinematography, beautifully shot and crafted well by Harold Rosson and you can see why he received an Academy Award nomination, just marvellous.When we come on to the songs things like ""Somewhere over the Rainbow"" come to mind but that isn't the only song that sticks in your head for a time after. ""Ding-Dong the Witch is Dead"" is another song famous for being a Munchkin dance and is a great song as well. ""We're off the see the Wizard"" is another absolute classic in the songbook and I can't think of any musical with so much goodness but also so many known songs, This film is lovingly crafted and so well written in the music department.Overall I felt it to be Solidly kind of good and although as you can see I don't agree with maybe most who see it, I still very much enjoyed it. If you haven't seen it then I couldn't recommend it more to you but I will say this, although loads and loads of film fans rate this number one and critics alike, don't expect to love this as much as some do, but then again you may fall in complete fantasy like love with it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Timeless,"""And you, and you, and you were there."" All of Dorothy's friends look at her as if she was crazy, assuring her that her adventure was just a dream. Was it really just a dream? How could it be, when it seemed so real? In Viktor Fleming's, ""The Wizard of Oz"", dream is made into reality and reality into dream. ""The Wizard of Oz"" is a classical masterpiece in which breathtaking design, performance and a heart-warming storyline combine to create a movie in its very own category.In Kansas, a twister hits Dorothy's home and she is hit by a window, falling into her dreamland of Oz. We follow Dorothy (Judy Garland) on her quest for the Wizard of Oz, in the land of munchkins, evil and good witches, and many more interesting characters. The Scarecrow (Ray Bolger), Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr), and Tin Man (Jack Haley) are just some of the friends, with their own problems, that she meets on her way. The story is all about ""following the yellow brick road"" as ""we're off to see the wizard.""The screenplay was adapted from Frank T. Baum's story chronicle, The Wizard of Oz. It was produced by Mervyn Leroy and acted out by a first class list of actors. Perhaps the most important factors of this movie are the Technicolor (this is the first movie in color), the songs (that you'll never forget and never get enough of), and the ubiquitous theme/moral of ""there's no place like home.""The plot is very easy to follow and straightforward. Despite the seemingly unrealistic storyline of wizards, a land of munchkins, flying monkeys, and bad witches flying on broomsticks, viewers can't help but fall into the fantasy of it all and imagine there really is such a place ""somewhere over the rainbow."" The characters are all believable and you seem able to relate to them and know at least one person in your life like them. People love the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion for their loyalty and personal quirks, and loathe the Wicked Witch of the West for being so sinfully evil. The dialogue is also very amusing, with a deeper meaning than most would conceive at first. There are many hidden messages of friendship, loyalty, and seeing what's right in front of you all along.The actors are very convincing as their characters, all seemingly to step right out from the original story. Judy Garland perhaps was the best choice for Dorothy because the viewer just can't help but fall in love and sympathize for her when they see those big brown eyes staring back at them from the screen. She has a raw performance in which you can feel each emotion through her expression. From the moment Dorothy opens her front door after landing in Oz and exclaims ""Oh!"" the screen is filled with bright and vibrant color, a sharp contrast from the dull black and white from a second before. The significance of this is not lost, as the use of color is artfully done throughout the movie. The Technicolor sets the film apart because it is the first picture to be in color. During the movie the ever present yellow brick road takes the viewer through a journey of colorful and unique places, like the charming Munchkin Land and eerily spooky Haunted Forest.This film is one that's timeless for a good reason. The acting is wonderful as is the set, themes, and dramatic aspects. The ""Wizard of Oz"" was one of a kind when it first came out and 75 years later it still touches people's hearts. The movie keeps the audience's interest and you walk away from it smiling. After watching the movie, it will give you a deeper respect for what you are and have. As Dorothy says, ""There's no place like home,"" well, there's no movie like the Wizard of Oz.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Fun, Colorful.....At Least For Two Viewings","It took almost 50 years for me to finally watch this movie, and I can see why it was so popular with a nice, tearful ending to a sweet - and colorful - story. The color in here must have the knocked the socks off the audience in 1939, although there were some others in the period that were spectacular color films, too, such as Gone With The Wind and The Adventures Of Robin Hood. Nonetheless, they didn't have a ""yellow brick road"" like this one!This film would undoubtedly be regarded by kids of the last 30 years as being way, way too corny, but that's just how times have changed. This is one of the ""kids movies"" with an adult message: there's no place like home.After three viewings, however, I had enough of Judy Garland's whining, almost hysterical voice throughout this movie and the yellow brick road DVD wound its way out of my collection, traded in for something else that starred someone else with a less-abrasive speaking voice.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A fantasy rooted in the landscape of your childhood.,"I have a theory that this movie has probably been seen by more people than any other movie. The fact that it comes to us as children is probably the reason why. Other films like 'Gone With the Wind', 'Citizen Kane', 'The Godfather', 'Star Wars', have been seen by a lot of people but in each case I can imagine people that might not have seen them. In the case of 'The Wizard of Oz' it's hard to imagine anyone who might not have seen it at some point in their lives. Almost everyone you talk to has a memory of their first experience. The reason this movie remains the most beloved of Hollywood films even after six decades is because 'The Wizard of Oz' is unique among motion pictures in that it mirrors our longings and imaginations as children.The movie, in front of and behind the scenes, has become movie folklore. We love the legends about the rotating directors, from George Cukor to King Vidor to Victor Fleming. We know the legend of Buddy Ebsen who had to drop out due to an allergic reaction to the Tin Man makeup and Margaret Hamilton whose dress caught fire and nearly had her face burned off because of the copper-based make-up. We love stories about the problems on the set between personal feuds, sweltering costumes, partying munchkins and the costume designer who had to keep up with Judy Garland's developing bust line. There's even a spurious legend of a ghost on the set. All of these elements make 'The Wizard of Oz' a much bigger legend than it already it, but that's okay because this is the one movie that deserves to be over-hyped. It occupies such a large part of our memories that we want to make it more than it is, to just have one more reason to make it more than a movie, we want it to be a life experience.That experience is brought to us because we are intimately familiar with its story elements. The dreams that Dorothy sings about and the adventure that follows seem to mirror our yearnings as children. She imagines a bigger place where her problems don't linger and she is free to explore them. She imagines a place where there isn't any trouble and people actually listen to what she has to say. She sees the rainbow as her golden gate to a better place because in her drab Kansas world, the rainbow is the only source of color that she knows. She dreams of a bigger place and imagines a world where troubles melt like lemondrops. We can relate. How many of us as kids sat in our room or in our yards and played, imagining a place to go and characters to interact with, a colorful world bigger than our small, confined worlds.Oz is meant to represent the colorful palette of our imagination but for Dorothy it is also a place where she does some growing up. The three friends that she meets along the way, The Scarecrow, The Tin Man and The Lion are emblematic of the lessons of bravery, love and devotion and the ability to think for ourselves. The Wicked Witch of the West certainly represents the real dangers along the way. For Dorothy there is a matronly figure, Glinda the Good Witch who intends for Dorothy to discover for herself how to solve her problems, she knows that Dorothy must grow up along the way. In a way, she seems to represent the parent that Dorothy doesn't have back in Kansas. Her aunt and uncle love her but this was a movie made during the depression and we imagine the climate that they live in, where work means keeping the farm. No work = no farm = no home.For 1939, Dorothy was the perfect character for young girls. She echoes many of the small town country girls who, in the midst of the depression, packed their suitcases and ran to Hollywood seeking fame and fortune in the movies. For them this film is a cautionary tale that they'd be better off if they just stayed home. Judy Garland was perfect in the role, 17 at the time, but with wide-eyes and a beautiful, open face she carries that sense of wonderment of a child. Like most of us as children, her only true companion is a dog named Toto and the most frightening moment in the film is when she is nearly robbed of her best friend. When she sings 'Over the Rainbow' we know that it's to escape an unhappy childhood (she has apparently lost her parents) and for Garland we identify. She began in show business as a kiddie act with her sisters and began her long movie career when she was only 13. She was already a familiar face from 'Love Finds Andy Hardy' and by the time of 'Oz' she was already under contract to MGM. That she was familiar to audiences helped her in the role. That familiarity works well with her ability to project the vulnerability and melancholy that the character has to have. We have to believe that she will become frightened and that her life will be in danger because if she doesn't that we sense that the character can work her way out of the situation herself and our interest wanes.If movies are a time capsule than 'The Wizard of Oz' wonderfully captures a brief moment of happiness in Garland's life. We know of her problems with studio execs that put her through an exhausting schedule and used drugs to get her going in the morning then put her to sleep at night. We know the legends of her mental and physical problems that dogged her most of her life but 'The Wizard of Oz' sees her at a moment in her life when it all seemed perfect, just as her star was rising and before her problems really began. There's poignancy in that, and that's why I think that the casting of Shirley Temple in the role would have been a mistake. By 1939, Temple was the biggest star in the world her presence in the film would have been too much, she would have stood out and we would only seen Shirley Temple, not Dorothy Gale.Garland's presence allows the story a certain credibility. I have tried to imagine that famous dance down the Yellow Brick Road with a 4 foot child and it just doesn't fit.If Garland gives the film its center than I think the production design, awe-inspiring in 1939, is the perfect backdrop. In these early musicals filmed on a soundstage it isn't hard to spot where the soundstage ends. Some have seen that as a flaw but I think it adds to the dreamlike quality of the film. The matte paintings behind the sets add to the storybook quality. The fact that we're in a dream makes it okay that the special effects look a little hasty. That was the genius of the screenplay, that and to establish the Oz characters as characters that Dorothy meets in Kansas. In our dreams we often see people and events that have recently occurred in our lives, but this is the first time I've ever seen it expressed in a movie. In particular is the notion that Professor Marvel keeps showing up as various characters in the dream.What generosity the filmmakers had. What ingenuity to create this entire world that is colorful and beautiful and scary. What depth of character they created. What messages they send. This is a movie constructed with loving care. We're told that those who worked on the film just thought of this as just another movie, but when I watch the film I find that hard to believe. Certainly from the screenwriters. I wonder if they saw how brilliantly they were tapping our frustrations and our excitement, our dreams, our need and our sense of wonderment. I wonder if they knew the impact of what they were working on, that the lovely sentiments that they created would still resonate 60 years later. I wonder if they knew that their heart's desires weren't that far from our own.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A great adventure, full of heart.","The Wizard of Oz is possibly one of the greatest movies ever made. It's full of life, energy and heart. This is probably what defines the term: movie-magic. There are so many classic moments here, after all this movie is still heavily quoted in pop-culture, 75 years after it was first released! The story is basically about a girl who longs for somewhere over the rainbow, and then gets what she wants... or is it really what she wants? The movie starts (as most people know) in plain sepia color, but when we first enter Oz, it switches to full color. This is truly amazing to see, especially in the 3D-bluray release! I must admit that I was a bit skeptic towards the 3D version, but when I watched it I was blown away! I felt suck in to the movie in a way that I had never been before!

Very gorgeous and beautiful - but is it the best?,"People have described this film as captivating, the best, most charming film they have ever seen. For some people there are a great deal many films they would prefer, but with no doubt it is likely every person will like this a wee bit in some wee way!One thing to congratulate is the special effects, which a lot of people do not seem to go on about. For the film's time, the special effects were probably the most special since films were invented (to some people anyway). Of course some of the ways they made illusions were easy, but very clever. Others were harder to make, such as the tornado and the flying monkeys.Other good points on the quality of the film are the superb acting, the way it was filmed, the scenes and the way the script was written - despite some points being not completely similar to the book.The characters of the film are very likable, especially the main four: Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion. Toto the dog is a delight too.The songs are very beautiful and entertaining - so is the fun dancing - avid young dancers may feel they want to get up and dance along with Dorothy, the Scarecrow and the Tin Man as they move their feet!One thing that just about everyone who watches this film will like, is the charm of the story and the characters, which is probably why this film has (sort of) gone down in history. Indeed this film is very likable and pretty captivating, a good job!The film starts in sepia to capture the mood of the setting - an old farm in Kansas and the rather dreary mood. The girl called Dorothy wishes to go to some other place and to help save her beloved dog from the stubborn Miss Gulch - who wants the dog after he annoyed her. When Toto is taken away and then escapes to return to Dorothy, it is the last straw for the girl, she is going to run away... That isn't all that happens, the plot twists and turns in a dramatic way.Enjoy ""The Wizard Of Oz""!7 and a half out of ten.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A classic,"While this was not the first iteration of The Wizard of Oz that I have seen, it certainly was nice to see where it originated from. Though it has a simple plot, it is old but gold, with many heart warming moral of the story. Though some parts of the film were a little odd and unnerving, given that this film was made at a time where this kind of films were very much at its infancy, it really isn't much I can complain about. It is not so much as a deal breaker but more like something to take note of. However I do believe that this is a film that would significantly cater to the tastes of some people. Unfortunately that is not mine, but I can still see that it is a good film and one that I believe everyone should watch at least once, if not for the story, then for the exposure of how monumental this film was for the industry.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Enchanting, almost nostalgic art!","With trepidation I decided to watch The Wizard Of Oz, for I have memories of it from when I was five, 32 years ago. My memory was of a flying house, and of a laughing witch, who didn't quite look like the witch I saw yesterday, but that is false memory for you! Of course yesterday I saw the movie as a hardened adult, as opposed to a pure innocent, so philosophically I am a different person. Even if there were no nostalgia in memory, there would have been, I feel sure, a sense that the morals of this movie would never be repeated today. We live in a world where even infants' dolls have been sexualised with makeup. Of course no time in history was innocent, but here we had a media that put warmth above ""cool"", charm above cynicism. There is something of a relatively European feel about Oz, a sensation I rarely see with Hollywood, with the magical The Lord Of The Rings trilogy being another example. The movie was an absolute joy to watch, such pleasure from movies is rare to be had, and I cannot recommend this enough, not just as an antidote to MTV-generation philistinism, but as a genuine work of art. No doubt much has been written on the skill and joyousness of the acting , the amazing sets, the imagination, the witty songs, the metaphors and the songs, all of which are perfect. I recommend showing this to all kids, it has so much more depth than the tacky, merchandising-driven modern stuff they ingest! And equally I recommend it to grown-ups, for we need this therapy more than the kids :)",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
MGM's much-loved classic,"Based on L Frank Baum's first book in his Oz series, and using the songs of Harold Arlen and Yip Harburg, with the talents of several directors including Fleming and Vidor, 'The Wizard of Oz' was the high point of MGM's 1939 output, despite originally losing money and almost losing its greatest moment, Judy singing 'Over the Rainbow'.Dorothy Gale is a pre-teen girl caught in a storm and magically transported, with her faithful dog Toto, from her Kansas backyard to the magical world of Oz, with its yellow brick road and Emerald City.  On the way she meets a scarecrow without a brain, a tin man without a heart, and a lion without courage, as well as some rather scary midgets and some flying monkeys.  Her journey with her odd new companions to see the grand Wizard of Oz takes the form of a musical odyssey to the green gates.As Dorothy, the young Judy Garland is exceptionally good ('lions and tigers and bears, oh my!'), while the roles of her three companions are ably filled by Ray Bolger (DVD outtakes show him to be an extremely agile scarecrow in the dance sequence cut from his first meeting with Dorothy); Jack Haley (replacing Buddy Ebsen as the Tin Man and fitting the role to a t); and the incomparable Bert Lahr as the outrageously larger-than-life lion.  The music is a trifle repetitive at times (especially the reprises of 'We're off to see the Wizard') but the bright Technicolor of Oz and the spirit of the thing wins over its audience.

I wish I could have followed the yellow brick road.,"I remember watching this movie when they would air it once a year on CBS a few years back. Now it is shown on a couple of different networks quite frequently. This is a wonderful film for the whole family. Who wouldn't want to take a journey to the magical land of Oz?I think that it is terrific how well this movie has held up over the years. It's going on sixty-two years since it was first released and yet, it is timeless. It is great to look back on a film that was made in the thirties, and compare it to the movies made in this day and age. This is a film that will just be something that stays around forever.The Wizard of Oz is enjoyable for people of all ages. Everything about it brings a smile to my face. Wouldn't it be wonderful to just magically be transported to a land of talking trees and little munchkins? Of course it would be. The flying monkeys, a talking lion, the astounding ruby slippers, and everything else adds a special kind of magic to the screen.The atmosphere and setting is magnificent. This is one of the things that makes the film so stunning. Anyway, the forest, the witch's castle, and even the farm is really well laid out.I don't think that the casting could have been done any better. Judy Garland shines as the innocent Kansas girl. Her dancing and singing just brightens the whole story up. The lion, tin man, and scarecrow perform amazingly also. Everyone involved down to the littlest munchkin acts so well.Even though this is a movie for everyone, it is categorized as a children's flick. The writing is good with very simple lines and problems, but slightly complex so we're not falling asleep of boredom.What's left to say? Other things like the wardrobe, special effects, musical talents, and even the famous yellow brick road, are so well put together. Oz gives us an idea of what an almost perfect world would be like. No matter how old this movie becomes and we still look back on it, we'll still be able to enjoy at least one thoughtful movie. Classics never die. (Hence the name.)",,Anonymous,Fantasy
What a great movie!,"I think everyone everywhere should watch this movie every year. Well I guess that is a bit much. I do believe, I do believe so says the cowardly lion in this wonderful tale. It has everything, black and white, a dog, a girl that can really sing, a lesson to be learned by all and of course a Wizard. I don't want to spoil this movie so if you haven't seen it I would suggest you go and buy it as soon as you can. I recently saw the re released 3 D version and thoroughly enjoyed it. What fun it was to see it in a big theater with lots of people who love this movie and it reminds many people of their childhood. I do wish there was a real place like Oz where you wouldn't have to go to work till at one but take an hour for lunch and then at two we're done! Jolly good fun.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Such a Magical Movie,"I love watching the classics and actually seeing every reason it's a classic in the first place. Some classics make me question the sanity of the people who made them, but luckily The Wizard of Oz deserves its title.No need for an extensive review, honestly. Everything was great. The performances were wonderful, the story was brilliantly adapted, and the music was just delightful. So many iconic images, moments, and words, a whimsical fantasy land, special effects (COLOR!) that had audiences in 1939 screaming and cheering. Such a fun watch, I can't get over it. I highly recommend you let yourself experience this beautiful film. I can't wait to watch it with my grandkids someday.10/10Bye love you",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wonderful Classic Film,"Dorothy is played by Judy Garland, and her portrayal has lost little of its charm over the years. I honestly believe somebody watching this film for the first time would enjoy it just as much as its original audience.Dorothy is a simple innocent girl and that's what warms us to her, and this helps us to identify with her. In addition the additional characters in the film have their own unique charms. But each one of them has enough quality for us to believe in them.The conversion from the original book to this film is done excellently the actors that were chosen to play each part were just amazing. Maybe for people today the visual adaptation does show its age, but I for one don't care it shows thought about set design maybe missing in today's blue screen studios.There are more recent adaptations of this film but in all honesty this one is still my favourite.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
We're off to the see the Wizard. The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.,"In every childhood's dream, we all have been inspired to be somewhere. Some have the dream to become someone in a different place. An place where speculation is an key point in that particular environment. Some dream about being in an place, where wonder and joy filled up their imagination. When Frank L. Baum wrote the book, ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"", his vision was much more different than the movie's adaption. In 1939, The Wizard of Oz was made into a motion picture. It is not only a motion picture for audiences, but a motion picture for all generations. The movie tells us about how Dorothy, played Judy Garland, set off on an adventure in the colorful, lively world of Oz. But, before even being situated in the world of Oz, let's start from the beginning. In the great state of Kansas, Dorothy is happily living in her little Kansas farm, with her aunt and uncle. But, an mean landlady named Mrs. Gulch has a grudge on Dorothy because Dorothy's dog, Toto, bit her. She is ignored by her guardians, who are helping out on the farm. Then, the movie strikes a major chord, and from there, The Wizard of Oz begins to unfolds as Dorothy sings the musical number, ""Over the Rainbow"". Soon enough, an huge tornado threatens Dorothy's home and eventually, Dorothy lands in the wonderful world of Oz. From there, her adventures will unfold and set the viewers on a vivid, magical, journey through Oz. Dorothy begins to make new friends with the people she comes in contact with. But, like any other fairy tale, there's always evil lurking. The Wicked Witch of the West threatens to take over Oz, and so it's up to Dorothy and her friends to make it to Emerald City to see the Wizard. There are supporting characters in The Wizard of Oz that consists of The Tin Man, The Cowardly Lion and The Scarecrow. Each one of those characters want to achieve something during this journey to see the Wizard. The Tin Man wishes a heart for his body. The Cowardly Lion wishes to be brave and have courage to stand up against his fears. The Scarecrow wishes he had an brain. Over time, The Wizard Oz had been broadcasts on local television stations over the last 30 years. It is till being shown on TV as of today. But, what is about The Wizard of Oz that makes the movie worth-watching? Well, there are a lot of reasons to speculate on that question. First of all, the original Frank L. Baum's novel was a dark allegory on historical figures being represented as the characters in the Wonderful World of Oz. In this movie version, those elements are thrown away. Second of all, the movie's appeal is to everybody. A lot of parents would take their kids to see The Wizard of Oz every time it is shown on TV or at the movies. In my opinion, The Wizard of Oz is timeless classic. This is a movie that is based on the tradition of magic. We, as the audience, are stunned when we see the world of Oz. Not only the set design of The Wizard of Oz is spectacular, but also, it has a juvenile feel to it. The spirit of the movie really makes the movie more pure than any other movie that is meant to seen by children. The Wizard of Oz is juvenile in its tone, especially the leading role of Judy Garland. For me, Garland is probably responsible for making the movie appeal to children. There's a deep meaning to the movie's argument on whether Dorothy's dream was real or fictional. This was significant when the movie was released in 1939. In the end, her dream is validated as being a dream. MGM was willing to gamble on The Wizard of Oz because it was the most expensive production at that time. The end result was an great-looking, very appealing and dazzling story of magic. The musical numbers in the movie are compelling and is full of joy as we hear Judy Garland's splendid singing voice that makes it all the more purer. It is a unforgettable classic that will live on for many centuries. And, also, there's no place like home. ★★★★ 4 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Classic Musical,"I saw this film when I was younger and it is just as witty and entertaining as I remember. The change from sepia tone to technicolor, then back to sepia tone was an interesting part of the movie that really shows the difference between the real world and the world of Oz. The change to color helped to give the land of oz that magical feel and really set the tone of the movie. I was pleased to see that the song-and-dance scenes actually moved the plot along in a nice way and gave the characters motivations to see the Wizard. I didn't like how some of the scenes felt a little bit too dragged on, especially in Munchkinland. I don't generally like musicals because of that factor but I was able to overlook it because it was only one scene or two and it still moved the plot forward, making it okay. I thought it was a good movie and definitely an amazing movie in its time.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Campy fairy tale that is strangely heavy-handed.,"A whirlwind hits Kansas and carries a young girl in to a strange and mystical world.One of those products that you feel slightly stupid reviewing, but I guess a new audience for it is born every minute. Also it a good example of a book and film that, while joined at the hip, are also very different products. The book is light, throwaway and fun while the film gets very heavy and morose almost like a horror movie. Very strange for a film aimed at children.Judy Garland's life was one big rollercoaster ride from beginning to end and seemed to  involve an unfruitful search for happiness through people, produce and drugs. How apt that her most famous film should also feature a similar journey and how sad that while reading the script she could not take on the moral: That happiness comes from within and that life is what you make of it.Garland's talent was (and remains through film) immense. What a pair of lungs and what vocal control. A freak of nature that was plucked from nowhere, exploited and then thrown away by the studio system. She died young, but she had lived her show business life already and had no role left to play other than sing to ever dwindling gay audiences. Oz maybe a cruel place at times, but it is no more cruel than the real world it apes.Here we have main characters that are in search of change, but they are living in a ""cast"" society in which function seems given by the state. Maybe I am thinking too literally, but how does Oz go round? Who paints the road yellow - and why? A road doesn't have to be completely painted to be followed and why brick, very expensive way to pave a road! Maybe examples of how nonsense stands out more in films.Maybe they thought that making this a musical would make it lighter and more fun. But it doesn't really work that way. Fun song and dance is one thing, but this hardly taking away the sense of danger and threat. Wicked witches are killers (or at least potential killers) so how can they be taken lightly or in jest? What is being demonstrated is that making the written page literal goes beyond the original intent. Children are meant to be slightly scared - not petrified as they would be watch this film.Legends have grown up around this film in production. From colour difficulty to the parties that the ""little people"" threw after filming was done for the day. I am sure most of them are myths and besides, I am sure there is partying and sex after the end of most day's filming on most films.In the Wizard of Oz we are transported to a strange world with great performances from all the leads, especially Garland who has to carry the weight of this giant production on her shoulders. I feel for her, where else is a child (or near child) expected to carry such responsibility but in show business? I guess the only world stranger than Oz is the world of show business.PS Do I get a cookie for not mentioning Over The Rainbow once in the main review?",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the most overrated films ever made,"I have to rain on the ""Oz"" parade here. For the life of me, I cannot fathom why this film is so revered, and I know my films. The 1939 ""Wizard of Oz"" has to be the most annoying, obnoxious, and overrated ""classic"" and ""great"" film ever made.The acting in ""Oz"" is horrible, the sets completely unrealistic always looking like they are indeed on a soundstage instead of looking anything remotely close to real (early Tim Burton syndrome), the characters are all annoying, really this is probably the most ""in your face"" obnoxious film ever. If it didn't strain SO hard to be a good film, this may have actually have been a decent ""B"" film, an early cheesy delight along the lines of countless 50's and 60's cheesy sci-fi, horror and fantasy films. But because ""Oz"" thinks a lot more or itself than it really should, it comes across as a bloated albatross of a pathetic attempt at decent fantasy.Even the supposed ""great"" song, ""Over The Rainbow,"" is completely overrated. It's a horrible, horrible song, completely unmelodic and painful to the ears. The one lone bright spot in the whole film is the Wicked Witch, with Margaret Hamilton playing the role so well and clever she easily outshines literally everything else the entire film has to offer.But hey, many people like the film, so that's the way it is. But speaking of this film in the same manner of real films like Gone With The Wind, Casablanca, and so many more, is a complete joke. ""The Wizard of Oz"" is probably the worst supposed ""great"" film ever made.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
a milestone,"People talk about The Wizard of Oz as a backdrop to their lives; and how true that is. I just saw it again, DVD, for the first time in--gosh!--20 years. There was a little art house in Lansing Michigan USA that ran it back then, on the popular premise that there's nothing like TWoO on ""the big screen."" That's the last time I'd seen it, 'til today.I guess the part that ""gets"" me about the movie is how the writers made it pretty plain that the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion really already had what they thought they were missing; that their respective problems were in misapprehending their own complete natures. That's a powerful statement for many of us. I found myself most touched in scenes where the Scarecrow was showing wisdom, the Tin Man feeling deeply (""...when I think of Dorothy in that awful place...""), and the Lion...well, maybe accomplishing this effect was harder in his case...what *is* true courage?Anyway, if you're reading this here, you must be a movie weenie, and you've no doubt already seen the movie, so I'm not going to recite the usual ""go see this movie"" mantra.I was just very touching to see this movie again, at this phase in my life.I will mention a few more things about how I now see this movie as a ""growed up"" (I'm almost 50): It's interesting how you can see the production values of the time; the lot sets and special effects and so forth. This movie is a powerful example of how a good story overcomes limited means in other areas.People who look back with disdain on the low-tech chintz of old movies can see in TWoO the magic ingredient; narrative solidity. And I'm not a pollyanna about this: I'm sure the underlying reality behind its making is rife with horror stories of expert disagreement, rewrites, discarding, jerryrigging, and the rest of it. But in the end, something like narrative love won out; and that's the important thing.Oh: And having Harold Arlen write the music was good luck indeed. And orchestrations which cleverly appropriated very tasty new ideas in composition (polymodalism, non-standard phrasings, etc.) didn't hurt, either!Geez, this movie is such a little universe....I'd better stop here.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Iconic American Cinema,"This is a definite 10/10. It is movie history. I don't know why anybody would rate it any less. Based on L.

Together with the Cowardly Lion, the Tin Man, and the Scarecrow, they must follow the yellow brick road to find the Wizard of Oz while being hounded by the Wicked Witch of the West.The colorful visual Technicolor is the best of the day.

A girl who goes runs away and wakes up in a new city.,"This movie is literally a classic for all generations. The different changes made it what it is today. The most memorable part for me is when the Dorothy comes out of the house and if goes from sepia to color. The plot line is good and easy to follow it's great for all ages. The Wizard of Oz is a solid memory to have as a child. Dorothy role was so strong and solid and shows what can ""happen"" when you want to run away. The effects in the movie are great, when the evil which first makes her appearance it's big and dramatic. Her entrance describes her character right then and there. When Glinda the good witch makes her appearance she comes in sweet and smoothly. That describes her character for the rest of the movie. I will always give this movie a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Film For All Ages,"""The Wizard of Oz"" is one of my favorite movies growing up as a child, and to this day; it is considered to be timeless. Everyone knows the story, characters, music, magic, fun, etc. This is a very memorable movie because again everyone knows the movie very well. The movie is based on L. Frank Baum's book, and there had been many adaptations for ""The Wizard of Oz"" which it was during the silent film era; so I guess you can say if the movie that I'm reviewing is somewhat like a remake of the original silent movies or not. I know that the movie had went many production changes along with the original director Richard Thorpe getting fired for lacking the movie's spirit. So now that we have what Dorothy Gale looks along with the Scarecrow, Tin Man, Lion, and the Wicked Witch of the West. Also, Victor Fleming taking over the director's chair for making such a wonderful looking movie, and making OZ look beautiful in Technicolor. I do know that he did not direct the Kansas scenes because of his commitment to work on another production from MGM studio's ""Gone With The Wind,"" which I never saw and don't know if I should see it. Maybe I should but I still don't know because I felt that movie stole the Oscar for Best Picture for not letting ""The Wizard of Oz"" win, but I digress. As I was saying about the Kansas scenes, they were pretty much much filmed by King Vidor. With that said, I thought the cast were perfect, and they do manage to bring their roles to life. Judy Garland is Dorothy Gale and she will always be remembered for playing that kind of role. Ray Bolger was fantastic as the Scarecrow along with Jack Haley as the Tin Man and Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lion. Margaret Hamilton does a memorable job to played the evil Wicked Witch of the West. The production design in this movie are sensational, and it does look a place where anyone fantasize in their own world away from their home. The cinematography is beautifully well shot for OZ being filmed in Technicolor, and the Kansas scenes being filmed in a Sepia tone. The special effects in this movie are quite special for the used of matte paintings; witch being melted; holographic head of the Wizard of Oz; and most of all the tornado. The tornado itself looks really good before there was any CGI by today's special effects. The movie ""Twister"" from 1996 does used CGI for the Tornado, while this movie was all done practically. The songs in this movie are indeed memorable such as ""We're off to see the Wizard;"" ""If I only had a Brain;"" ""If I only had a Heart;"" ""If I only had the Nerve;"" and everyone's favorite ""Over the Rainbow."" The movie never gets tiring, and anyone can watch this movie as much as they want to because the movie's premise along with the pacing goes by very well. I wish I can say more about this movie, but everyone who has seen this movie had already said about what makes this movie so special. As of that, they are very much right. After this movie was made, there were more ""OZ"" movies that appear on the big screen as ""The Wiz"" based on its play which it is not a good movie and never saw the play. Also, there were two more ""OZ"" movies that were made by Disney such as ""Return of Oz"" and ""Oz the Great and Powerful."" Those were good movies, but none of them were as good as the original timeless classic. ""The Wizard of Oz"" is never going to die, and it will live on forever. This is a film for all ages for both children and adults. As Dorothy would say ""There is no place like,"" to me I say ""There is no great OZ movie like this one."" I give ""The Wizard of Oz"" a perfect 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
We're off to see the wizard.,"This technicolour triumph tells the time-old tale of Dorothy, a young girl who gets whisked away to the magical land of Oz and must find a way back to Kansas with some help from a few friends she picks up along the way. 'The Wizard Of Oz (1939)' is a colourful, quite energetic musical that's as iconic as they come, practically etched into the memory of every cinema-loving person regardless of if they've seen it all the way through or not. The flick has some legitimately entertaining sequences and its aesthetic really is distinct, brought to life with stellar set-design and creative costuming that almost pops off the screen. It does sag a little in its mid-section and it isn't exactly complex when it comes to its themes. In a way, its story is a little too straightforward. Plus, its sanded edges make for a somewhat 'vanilla' experience. Still, the picture is mostly enjoyable and is practically the definition of escapist fantasy. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Missed the hype,"When I first viewed this movie as a child, I thought it was okay. As an adult I'm not the least bit moved. Great use of light, color and overall mise en scene, yes.

Immortal,"It's hard to overstate the true significance of this film. The Library of Congress informs us that it is the most watched film ever made. Its signature song, ""Over The Rainbow"", written for the film, didn't merely win the Oscar for best original song of 1939. More significantly, decades later the Recording Industry Association of America and the National Endowment for the Arts both voted this song as the number 1 song of the twentieth century. The American Film Institute ranked it as the greatest movie song of all time.But the film's accolades go on and on. It is one of only a few films listed in UNESCO's ""Memory Of The World"" Registry. Even in a supporting role, actress Margaret Hamilton turned her Wicked Witch into American Film Institute's 4th-greatest villain of all time, behind Hannibal Lecter, Norman Bates, and Darth Vader. All of the main actors and many people responsible for the film's technical achievements have received and continue to receive innumerable awards and honors seventy years after the film was released.From its inception as a children's book in 1900 by author L. Frank Baum, the simple story was retold countless times in novels, stage presentations, and other forms, in many subsequent years, including: 1908, 1910, 1914, 1925, 1933, and 1938. But it was the film of 1939, directed by Victor Fleming, that propelled the story into immortality.With its perfect 3-Act structure, the script creates iconic characters and iconic dialogue. Some lines have morphed into cultural clichés, they are so often repeated. How many times has the line ""Toto, I've a feeling we're not in Kansas any more"" been borrowed by hack writers to use in their hack scripts? I think it was Oscar Wilde who said: ""imitation is the sincerest form of flattery that mediocrity can pay to greatness"".At a deeper level than the well-known story, the film's many allegories have been and will continue to be debated by scholars. Many of these allegories are so subtle they may never be appreciated by viewers, especially in an age when subtlety has been rendered a forgotten art. Is the naïve Dorothy really the American people? Does the yellow brick road symbolize the gold standard? Is the Emerald City a symbol of materialism that we in the early 21st century might equate to Wall Street?A deep, intellectual script it may be, but the film would be merely great without its underlying emotional appeal to the heart. It's the visuals and music that render the film so beloved by the world.And when you join the simple, yet intellectual, story with the power of great visuals and great music, you create a timeless expression of the human experience. The summary message is thus conveyed that no matter where or how far you may roam, and no matter what joys and friendships you may experience along the way, after all and in the end, there's no place like home.It's almost impossible to view this film objectively, critically, so magical, mythical, and powerful has it become. It's a film that does not require a plot summary; it's too well known for that, too burned into our collective consciousness.Academy Award films, well-made classic films linger with us. But ""The Wizard Of Oz"" isn't just another Oscar winner or classic film. It is unique, its own category, a one-of-a-kind artistic expression. There will never be another film quite like it. If humans are still around a thousand years from now, someone, somewhere, using some form of futuristic technology, will be watching it, enthralled by its universality, its timelessness.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
My guess is that this is not what the writer of the book envisioned.,"The film has a certain charm about it and considering the time period it was made in it was a very well made film. However, I am betting the writer was not envisioning a musical with people dressed in what looks like Halloween costumes. Once again for the time I am sure they did the best they could, but looking back on it the characters of the Scarecrow, Tin man, and the Lion just are not that impressive, granted they are great for a child to see as that sequel that Disney put out years later had some freaky stuff that spooked me as a kid. That would be more my style now so that is why I am commenting about it, I am not really wanting to disparage this film it is just that my tastes have changed and this is not going to be a movie I can really sit through now. However, I remember it fondly from my childhood so I give it a seven which is a rather good mark to me. The witch was excellent, I do not know who played that part, but she convinced me that she was the bad witch. And while I normally do not care for musicals, the songs in this film were nice and catchy and did not detract from the film as the song sequences in other films tend to do for me. The cast is good, though I do not think Judy Garland should have been Dorthy. She seems to old for the part and at times it seems a bit strange when she is talking as she is talking like a twelve year old and she looks like she could be in her twenties. She has a nice singing voice though so that makes up for it a bit. All in all a good film, I would suggest a remake that had more edge to it, but I figure they would screw it up royally. I do want to try and find that ""Return to Oz"" movie though as I hear it was rather dark and at times had very frightening imagery.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

An institution on television.,"For me, OZ wasn't a movie so much as it was a family ritual. It was so embedded in my childhood and puberty, that I no longer thought of it as a movie- especially since it had an annual pilgrimage on television. I was still in diapers when it aired on CBS- the first time. That network's contract with the film only lasted until 1967 (I was just five then), and then the film switched its airings from CBS to NBC between 1968 and 1975- though CBS would take it back and air it yearly until the end of the 20th century. I watched it during the NBC period, and it was always introduced with the NBC peacock- with a special reminder that the first 19 minutes were in black and white. We would always circle the date on the calendar, and it always seemed to be a Spring broadcast, usually on Easter Sunday. And when the tornado sequence ended with the house crashing down, you could hear a pin drop in our living room. My favorite part of the film- since I was five- is watching the film change from b/w to the color of Munchkinland simply by opening the front door. (I saw the film years later as a college student in a real theater, and this scene actually brought whistles and applause from the audience!!) That's what I remember the most. When it left network television, I purchased the DVD.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Unbelievable and overrated,"Let me start by saying I saw this movie on the same night as 3 other (completely different) movies: the Japanese AFTER LIFE, Kubrick's early work KILLER's KISS and horror-classic DAWN OF THE DEAD. And like many other ""classics"", this one just doesn't do the trick for me. Right, you have to watch these films(other example: THE SEARCHERS with John Wayne) with an open mind and from the point of view of years ago. I can accept that, as I can also accept the other style of acting and film-making. But what should really make such a film timeless? Right, the story. And this film just has one of the most ludicrous stories in movie history, even for a fantasy: not once have I even smiled(besides with the bits that were later used to parody in THE SIMPSONS, AFTER HOURS, NAKED GUN,etc.), not one moment was there a feeling of suspense(the characters were simply never in danger), not once did  you get involved in the story and, most of all, the story was filled with gaps. The film however has some beautiful scenery and though I'm not a big musical fan either, I found the songs rather enjoyable. But, in my opinion, that just isn't enough for a film to be called a classic. ""Old"" doesn't necessarily mean ""good""!    5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Frankie Dee Brown omitted as a black munchkin,"My dad told me that Frankie Dee Brown played in this movie as a munchkin. Hs said that this is the same Frankie Dee brown that was Ruby Dee's first husband. That was prior to marrying Ossie Davis!! Mr Dee as he was called, resided in Omaha, Nebraska during his final years. He was a midget and was often mistaken for a female by workers in a local Walgreens Drugstore. My dad used to tell me that when employees saw him from behind and heard his high pitched voice it was an easy mistake to make, but Mr Dee was quick to correct anyone who called him such!! My dad made it a habit to speak to Mr Dee every time he came into the store and loudly say ""HELLO MR DEE HOW ARE YOU THIS FINE DAY?"" He said that this greeting was also a way let people know that Mr Dee was not a little old lady. He told me that Mr Dee used to frequent a local Pharmacy called Lothrop Drugs before it closed and that was where the staff informed him (my dad) about Mr Frankie Dee Brown's marriage to Ruby Dee for 4 years!!

My All Time Favorite Movie,"Fun fact: I don't like musicals, but this film is without a doubt my favorite musical of all time and my favorite movie of all time. This is a movie I never get sick of. I am 19 years old and have been watching it every year since I was 5, and I am a huge fan of old movies.
All the actors in the movie are phenomenal but my most favorites were Judy Garland, Margaret Hamilton and Bert Lahr. Their characters were the best because even though the witch is evil, I loved the Wicked Witch of The West and all her lines because she made me laugh a lot, Dorothy was a very caring character to Toto, the lion, the Tin Man, and the scarecrow, and the Cowardly Lion was always a character I related to as someone who gets nervous a lot.
I will say though, the only thing I don't like about this film is what happened to Garland behind the scenes. If you do research, you will find out she had to not have sleep for 72 hours and overworked her, and whenever she slept it was only for 4 hours. Her mother and Louis Meyer also started her on drugs during this time as well, as well as have her barely eat.
All that aside, if you have never seen this movie, you are seriously missing out! It is one of the best movies of all time. 10 out of 10 for me. A+",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Technicolor Dreams and Black-and-White Realities,"The magic of ""The Wizard of Oz"" isn't just in its musical numbers or the effects that, for the time, were a visual spectacle. What really makes the 1939 film shine is its ability to touch on universal themes of fear, friendship, and the search for belonging-elements that leave a deep mark on kids and adults alike. The iconic shift from black and white to Technicolor when Dorothy (Judy Garland) arrives in Oz is more than a technical feat; it's an emotional and symbolic leap. It marks the shift from the dull gray reality of Kansas to a world full of possibilities and challenges, where the unknown is both vibrant and frightening. This initial transition captures the film's essence, transforming it from simple entertainment into a personal journey for both the protagonist and the audience.Character development is one of the film's core strengths, especially since each figure along Dorothy's path represents a piece of her emotional growth. Dorothy, so young and vulnerable, is portrayed by Judy Garland with such sensitivity and depth. Her natural vulnerability grounds the story, especially when she encounters characters like the Scarecrow (Ray Bolger), the Tin Man (Jack Haley), and the Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr), each representing parts of ourselves that resonate with childhood insecurities. It's a clear allegory of growth, where Dorothy learns-while helping her friends-that these insecurities are within us all, and courage, wisdom, and love, though they seem distant, are closer than we think.One of the film's most notable aspects is its seemingly lighthearted tone that actually conceals an immense psychological depth. For kids, Dorothy's adventure is pure fantasy; for adults, it's a reflection of the childhood anxieties and hopes that often stay with us through life. The dreamlike structure-seen in the tornado that whisks Dorothy away and the characters who have doubles back in Kansas-is a narrative tool that works well for kids, but also gives adults a sense of circularity, where the dangers and rewards in Oz mirror real-life struggles and triumphs. This lasting impact keeps the film timeless; every time I rewatch it, I find a new layer waiting to be uncovered.The cinematography and visual effects in ""The Wizard of Oz"" stand out, but in a way that feels almost ""homemade,"" especially when compared to modern standards. The sets look like sets, and the effects proudly show their handmade nature. But this simplicity is one of the film's most charming qualities. The yellow brick road and the Emerald City have a magic that surpasses realism; they're like a child's imagination, where everything is fantastic but clearly artificial. This approach makes Oz even more memorable and real to viewers because it awakens that childlike sense of adventure, where we aren't looking for realism but for wonder and discovery.The cast is another major highlight, especially Garland, who brings a touching vulnerability to Dorothy, perfectly balancing sweetness and sadness that guides the entire story. Haley, Bolger, and Lahr, as Dorothy's friends, give genuine and charismatic performances, bringing humanity to the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion that goes beyond their symbolic ""flaws."" The trio captivates because their insecurities mirror our own, creating instant connection. Margaret Hamilton, as the Wicked Witch of the West, gives us an antagonist who is both scary and fascinating, essential for a children's fantasy where ""evil"" needs to be strong but not so terrifying as to alienate younger audiences.""The Wizard of Oz"" is also timeless because of its central message: the journey of self-discovery. As they travel, Dorothy and her friends realize that the qualities they're searching for outside themselves are actually within. This lesson is universal and enduring, resonating with viewers of any age. Dorothy begins her journey wanting to run away, but she discovers that, despite its flaws and hardships, Kansas with her family is truly where she belongs. It's a moving, somewhat bittersweet ending, as the Technicolor magic of Oz fades back to black and white, as though the magic, learning, and adventure were a dream-but one that left lasting marks.Overall, ""The Wizard of Oz"" is more than a cinematic classic; it's an exploration of the child's subconscious and a tribute to the journeys we all undertake in life. The combination of adventure, friendship, and discovery comes together like few productions of its time, and its cultural impact is proof of its emotional depth. Perhaps that's why it remains so relevant, filled with meanings that only grow richer over time. After all, at some point, each of us has felt like Dorothy-lost, dreaming, and searching for a place to call home.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It was good to see some imaginary piece of art after having seen many movies bogged down in overrated realism.,"Dorothy,who is an orphan kid,lives with her aunt Aunt Em and Uncle Henry.Whe she gets into a clash with the humorless old witch Almira Gulch (Margaret Hamilton)in the neighborhood she decides to leave Kansas.On the road she meets Professor Marvel(Frank Morgan).Under the magical talking of the professor she understands she should go back but on the way back home she gets herself into a twister and she can't reach her aunt and uncle because the whole whole family is already down in the cellar and cannot hear her kicking on its door.After that we see Dorothy in the magical trappings of the Land of Oz.Actually the fun of the movie starts here you know.The dry sepia techni-colored Kansas environment and the dialogs sound so affected until the land of OZ.At the land of OZ you can't help reducing yourself to the enjoyment of a great imaginary musical.Maybe it will sound really irrelevant but I myself like realism in a movie and I don't like fantastical elements much but after seeing a Kurosawa movie(Rashomon which I found highly over-rated)I really liked this imaginary piece of art.I heard people remember this movie as a backdrop to their youth.

"""Only bad witches are ugly.""","What a curious lesson in morality that is. But then there's plenty more in this dated musical about a redneck girl's Day-Glo daydream.With self-conscious sentimentality this film is so sanitised that a chubby Judy Garland can fall into a pigsty without being covered in a single drop of pig muck. However, it's impossible to criticise the film in modern terms  Garland's stagy, melodramatic performance was typical for the time  and the whole movie has the sense of the classic, if not actually the sense of being any good.The picture's transformation from monochrome to Technicolor is justly praised, though the painted backdrops are a little obvious and two-dimensional. It's images seemingly inspired (and were improved by) Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. There the Oompa Loompas would dole out social commentary in song form; here the Munchkins chant asinine phrases. And just how irritating are the Munchkins? It's all really quite twee and forced, and despite entering the collective consciousness, songs like ""Follow The Yellow Brick Road"" are really quite annoying when heard for real. It's all very ambitious, but there's also an unsettling lack of genuine wit.Much better are the talking trees, wicked witch and flying monkeys. All silly now of course, but absolutely terrifying to children. I still remember being scared silly at the witch being dissolved with water. There's also a scene with the Tin Man where his dance causes him to almost topple over in moves mimicked by Michael Jackson in Moonwalker. Jackson would later play the Scarecrow in the all-black version, The Wiz. That's the character without a brain. How curious.Of course, this is definitely not one to watch with an after-Christmas hangover, the ""lions and tigers and bears"" chant being particularly grating on the senses. Brash and unremittingly childish, The Wizard of Oz is less a cinematic experience, more like spending 100 minutes being shouted at by a hyperactive toddler.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The Wizard of Oz,"This movie is so nostalgic not only for myself but probably for anyone born from 1930 and beyond.

In the same breath though it is quite cheesy and goofy. However, I think most viewers would agree that is what makes the movie so enjoyable.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A good movie,"You follow your own yellow brick road and choose what way you want to go. The writer did an amazing job with putting parallels into the story. I like how in the beginning of the movie there was a short story about Dorothy and her life and after she was bumped her head and went to Oz, the same story was told but in much more detail. If I were to write a story with parallels this movie would be a great example to look at. Part of the parallel writing included having the main characters show up in Kansas and Oz and the non main characters only showing up in Kansas or Oz. The workers on Dorothy's aunt and uncles' farm in Kansas were also in Oz. The worker that told Dorothy to have a brain was the scarecrow, the worker who told Dorothy to have a heart was the tin man, and the worker who told Dorothy to have courage was the lion. Mrs. Gulch from Kansas was one of the wicked witches and the professor Dorothy met when she was trying to run away was the wizard. The non main characters were mainly in Oz, for example, the munchkins, flying monkeys, and the soldiers the wicked witch had.When Dorothy landed in Oz and was given the shoes I did not think the shoes were going to be a big deal. Turns out, the shoes show Dorothy's' inner struggles and she has to decide if she would be a good witch (make good choices in life) or a bad witch (make bad choices in her life). She has temptations from the bad witch; however, she did not give in. When Dorothy finally woke up in Kansas she was a completely different girl. Before, she took people for granted liker her aunt and uncle and she tried to run away. When she woke up, she showed them respect and love which shows she chose the inner good witch. If she came back and was still disrespectful and took them for granted she would have chosen the inner bad witch.In this movie Dorothy had a mentor that watched her and only helped her when she really needed help. Glenda, the good witch, was Dorothy's mentor and Glenda wanted Dorothy to choose her own paths. When Dorothy was following the yellow brick road and there were three ways to go Glenda did not tell her what way to go, Dorothy had to make the decision. Dorothy needed help the most when she fell asleep due to the poppy flowers so, Glenda helped by making it snow to wake Dorothy up. Glenda only helped Dorothy this time because she fell asleep and would not wake up. Since she was asleep, Dorothy could not go on and follow the path.The wicked witch of the west wanted the shoes her sister, the wicked witch of the east was wearing. By the way the wicked witch of the west was acting, she did not care that her sister was dead because she only cared about getting the shoes. When the shoes appeared on Dorothy's' feet, the witch of the west became very angry and disappeared with intentions of getting the shoes. The wicked witch of the west was watching Dorothy throughout her journey and when Dorothy started to get close to the castle, the wicked witch tried to stop her by putting a poppy field in Dorothy's way to make her sleepy. However Glenda helped Dorothy and Dorothy made it to the castle. Dorothy had to go to the witches' castle and the witch ended up kidnapping her. The witch realized that she could not make Dorothy give in so, the witch gave Dorothy an choice, either give the witch the shoes or Dorothy's dog would be taken. When musicals have a happy ending, the good characters rise and the evil characters fall and in this musical, Dorothy rose because she became a better person who showed respect and the wicked witch of the west ended up dying.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Oz- life's lesson's for children of all ages.,"""The Wizard of Oz"" a MGM's adaptation of L. Frank Baum's 1900 fantasy classic The Wonderful Wizard of Oz has become a beloved movie standard which is reported to be the most viewed film ever made. This classic movie touches the heart and invites each viewer to relive a childhood sense of wonder and adventure. How many have grown up having viewed this 1939 movie not necessarily recognizing its cutting edge impact during the transitioning from black and white to Technicolor? It is interesting to contrast other musical adventure cinema to The Wizard of Oz. More recent movies such as Annie, The Sound of Music, or Mary Poppins do not capture and stretch the imagination holding dear specific scenes to our hearts as does the story line and characters in Oz. The songs that each of the character sings along the journey to Oz representing meaning and inspiration to us individually. ""If I only had a brain"", ""If I only had a heart"", ""If I only had the nerve and were king of the forest.""Judy Garland who portrays Dorothy lends a heart touching and melancholy singing of ""Somewhere over the Rainbow"" that draws the viewer into her dream filled story. Dorothy ultimately finds true happiness by realizing that everything we seek in life is found in our understanding of home which she possesses all along. The movie stresses core components of 1930's belief systems (these seem to be diminishing in today's families) that of the importance of love, heart for others, brains, and courage. The Land of Oz and Dorothy's journey along the yellow brink road symbolize both the joy, challenge, and dangers faced when seeking the wisdom of our life's understanding and ultimate happiness. The movie also demonstrates the importance of friendship and relationship with others as we face life's struggles. The characters who play a part in her life at the farmhouse and along the yellow brick road are represented by Ray Bolger portraying 'Hunk' / The Scarecrow, Jack Haley portraying 'Hickory' / The Tin Man, and Bert Lahr portraying 'Zeke' / the Cowardly Lion. Each actor gives us endearing and memorial lines that remain etched in our childhood memories.From a technical standpoint the scenes are focused on the characters where there is dialog. It appears that with each scene the camera shot breaks with a distinct transition. The editing of each individual scene has natural progression and follows the poignant storyline. Yet I didn't feel that the editing was so much smooth as it was natural in terms of following the dialog, flow of song, or background sounds. For that time period the editing appears smooth yet in comparison to today's computer generated 3D and High Definition technology it appears choppy and a bit disjointed at times. In many ways given the time period the editing and follow of scenes are very effective. The story and adventure are certainly geared toward the youth. However the costumes make up and music certainly keeps adult audiences interested and engaged. The visual appearances and disappearances of the wicked witch are done well given the time period. The visual of color when entering the dream sequences of The Land of Oz definitely adds great contrast impact and makes each scene more dynamic. Everything described from the yellow brick road, ruby slippers, emerald city pertains to vibrant color. The film provided realistic imagery to the eye even though this is very much a fantasy dreamlike setting.From my perspective it might be scene where Margaret Hamilton who portrays Miss Gulch/the Wicked Witch of the West and Dorothy (Judy Garland) that leaves the lasting memory and underpinning theme of the journey. How more visceral can the director demonstrate innocence and purity defeating unhappiness and evil? How poetic this visual demonstration of simplify pouring water on the evil in life proving they are just all wet. Even more importantly is Dorothy who demonstrates humble compassion as she accidentally throws the bucket of water on the witch in an attempt to save the scarecrow from burning up. The effective believability of the dim lit background coupled with the effects of colored smoke and a slowly shrinking witch screeching ""Oh No I'm melting. The screenwriter and director Victor Fleming along with special effects technicians have crafted a visually and thought proving fantasy that surpasses the expectations of all imaginative viewers.the end the soft background, satiny colors, and voice of Glenda, the good witch of the north portrayed by Billie Burke represents a motherly figure who provide the wisdom that Dorothy trust in bring her back home. The vibrancy of the ruby slippers and the three clicking of the heals together might suggest that it is heart, brains, and courage that are the inherent qualities we all possess yet must use to take us home or on our life's journey. The lesson is that children both young and old often fail to recognize ""There is no place like home."" By having the open eyes to see compassion, intelligence, and demonstrating a courageous heart we all move forward to capture our dreams. The Wizard of Oz is a musical fantasy movie that provides far more than munchkins, witches, and a tornado that propels a Kansas farm setting into the Land of Oz, it's a life's lessons for children of all ages.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What else can I say?,"This is one of the few films that just about everyone I've ever known has seen. So much has been said about it before that there's almost nothing left to say. Having said that, what else can I say than that ""The Wizard of Oz,"" is perfect? This classic seems to endure from age to age, generation to generation. So what is it about this film that works so well? The plot is ridiculous beyond all reason, but that's not the point. There's something about the film that makes me cry at the end every time. This is the film that teaches us to believe in who we already are, that ""There's no place like home."" There's also themes of the power of friendship, courage, etc. Combined with ""Over the Rainbow,"" ""The Yellow Brick Road,"" and more of the best original movie songs ever written, everything about this film works.

One of my favorite movies,"I likely saw this before the age of 5-6, however this is the earliest I can remember seeing ""The Wizard Of Oz"". This is one of those movies that you appreciate more as you get older. As a small child, I remembered this movie most for the characters. As I got a bit older I began to appreciate the use of color film in the movie, and the impact that it has on the audience.It wasn't until I was in my 20's that I began to appreciate this movie on all levels. It's an incredible story, and it's also kinda messed up at the same time. The characters falling asleep in the poppy fields for example... not too many children's movies these days with characters getting so high off of opiates that they're passed out in fields. There's also commentary about the economic conditions at the time this film was shot (""All we own - we owe"" as chanted by the guards).1939-1940 was likely the most extraordinary period of movie-making in Hollywood history, and ""The Wizard of Oz"" was one of the most extraordinary movies of that period.

"VIEW IT AS AN ADULT, VISUALIZE IT AS A CHILD","I first watched ""The Wizard of Oz"" as a child. It was memorable for many reasons. The songs, the cartoon quality of the characters, and the colorful story and sets made it a life experience I remember to this day. Most vivid to me as a child of 7-8 was how scared I was of the Wicked Witch of the West.  I have seen this film many times since, and have enjoyed it with my siblings and my wife and children also. It is truly one of the great films of all time. In fact, it was ahead of its time. I am surprised it is only #52 on the list of greatest American films. It is part of our DNA, as virtually every American has seen this film.  Judy Garland, Ray Bulger, and Jack Haley are marvelous together, and the the supporting cast very memorable.  What other movie has munchkins?  The songs are very catchy, and ""Over The Rainbow"" is one of the great songs of the 20th Century.

Decent brick road,"A film with enough mischief and aesthetic accomplishment to be worth seeing in this day and age. Absolutely not a must-see as far as I'm concerned, though. It's extremely dated and very specifically American; the film is simply virtually unknown in France, which affords me a less chauvinistic and nostalgic perspective than its usual audience. The very old-fashioned look is as much a strength as it is a burden: what was whimsical and mischievous when it first came out is occasionally a little creepy here; on the other hand, this unintentionally sinister aspect lends the work an amusing added value. Some of the scenes are quite incredible on a technical level: the flying house in the tornado and the switch to technicolor are very memorable and sincerely creative. After these two consecutive scenes, the film follows a very predictable path (of yellow bricks) as a children's musical. The songs range from decent to atrocious (the lion number in Emerald City). The costumes are interestingly made, but the characters wearing them are rarely captivating, their erratic wanderings often becoming more irritating than anything else. Beautiful expressionist and sometimes even gothic backgrounds (the witch's castle) are poorly exploited and marred by sluggish scenes.The moral lessons at the end are, if we're being magnanimous, of highly dubious quality.An old film to check off your list if you feel like it, or possibly an interesting feature for aficionados of cinematic history and technique (which isn't really my thing). I don't think it's still very digestible for today's children - far better works have been and are being made for the little ones nowadays; it's potentially a different story for American people for cultural reasons.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Just not my type of movie, I guess.","Ok. I readily admit that Wizard of Oz is a classic. It's full of style, wonder, and originality. But I just don't like it. I didn't care much for it when I saw it as a kid, I didn't like it as an adult, and I certainly don't like it now that I've seen it 100 times thanks to my 3 year old nephew.I don't mind musicals most of the time. One of my favorite animated films, The Prince of Egypt, is as full of songs as any similar Disney cartoon. But the songs in that film were well done in my opinion. They had sweep when they needed to be, hit emotional waves when it seemed appropriate. In the Wizard of Oz, everyone sings pretty much all the time, and it's one of those films where absurd words and terms are inserted simply to keep the rhymes going, even if the line doesn't make any sense. Imagine a Doctor Suess book being sung in chorus. Sure it rhymes, half of the words are made up. There's a good deal of that in Wizard.And you better like ""We're off to see the Wizard"", the song you've heard since the beginning of time and already are tired of. You'll hear it in this movie about half a dozen times, without any significant changes or necessity. I know that movies like this are supposed to this way, it just drives one nuts.The acting is typical of hammy 50s productions, just a decade older. Everyone enunciates very properly and/or hammily, and look to be on the verge of bursting into song, which often is the case. That's pretty much how it stays once Dorothy gets to Oz, which is after the boring first fifteen minutes of the film.I know that people will seethe when they read this review. I'm sorry, I just really don't like this movie. As a musical, and a whimsical kids' movie, it succeeds at what it attempts to be. But I just can't understand why this is considered a film benchmark, when there are plenty of more interesting and less annoying musicals to be enjoyed. Granted, ""Over the Rainbow"" is a good song, and my favorite was one sung by the coroner of Oz (whose tune lasts about 4 verses). But the rest? Man...to me, it's just utter tedium. The movie may be good for kids, but I just can't understand why any adult would care to sit through it. I'm obviously in the minority, so what can I say. I just wanted to voice my opinion, which is that Wizard of Oz is vastly overrated. Read the book instead, or watch something better from the era such as Casablanca.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The worst ones are the munchkins who speak in incredibly irritating voices, wear hideous costumes and sing a song that lasts a million years. Not to mention that they feel quite offensive towards little people to me. And nobody can talk properly either! (Somebody could argue that everyone in Oz is imagined by a child so that's why they behave so weirdly. That doesn't stop it from being extremely unpleasant to watch them, though.)The music is also all terrible (except for Somewhere Over the Rainbow). Whenever a musical number started I would roll my eyes and pray that it wouldn't go on too long.I don't think this opinion could convince anyone who likes this movie because I'm basically just ranting, saying that I find it annoying. But that's how I feel. Everything just irritates and infuriates me. And I don't just hate old movies by the way: I love plenty of movies that are as old or older than The Wizard of Oz. I even like some children's movies from the time like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. So I don't know what happened here.If I have to give some positives, I guess that the movie looks good for 1939 and the black-and-white section at the beginning is fine. (The scene with the fortune teller is actually kind of good.) And admittedly there are some pretty clever ideas like the transition from black-and-white to colour and the Wizard actually being a normal man. This movie is technically not a complete wash but I find it outrageously irritating.P. S.: Dorothy looks 17 but acts like she's 8 (she's meant to be 12) and I find this really unsettling.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
about picture of aunt em and Dorothy,"I have noticed at the beginning of TWO oz Professor Marvel does this crystal ball thing with Dorothy and he takes her basket and pulls out a picture of Dorothy and Aunt Em. After he looks at it he stuffs it under his leg and does not give it back to Dorothy. I wonder if anyone knows about this and what the purpose of it might be. After watching the movie several hundred times since I was about 7 years old in the 50's,this is the first time I noticed it, about a week ago. I have noticed things like this in other movies that I have seen many many times and just when I thought I learned the entire dialog and every movement in this movie, I see something new that I have never seen before. Thank technology for VHS or a lot of things would go unnoticed and anyone watching a certain movie would not get the full benefit of the director's effort.

"30 years old, still love The Wizard of Oz","As I type this, I am watching the brilliant Wizard of Oz on TV - probably for the 100th time! I haven't seen the movie for about 10 years, but I can tell you I am still almost word perfect. Every little musical note perfect too! The songs, the characters, the munchkins, the red shoes, the scenery switching early on from sepia to colour. So clever and so simplistic yet so beautiful and rare for todays movies where digital enhancing is the only way to arrange a movie. I find it completely amazing how this movie transports you in time to a place somewhere from your childhood dreams. It is as vivid and wonderful now as it was when I watched it when I was 5 years old. Gosh, 1939 was even before my parents time! This movie is a classic that hopefully my children can enjoy as well. Providing they can get past the likes of the Wiggles! Absolutey fabulous!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The Greatest Fantasy One Could Embark On,"In 1900, Lyman Frank Baum wrote a story about a little girl named Dorothy who was hurled away from dusty Kansas to the magnificent land of Oz, filled with talking Scarecrows, wicked witches, big headed wizards and magical shoes. This story was so successful upon it's release that several film adaptations have been made throughout the years, but it wasn't until 1939 when the world first saw the film that is probably the most well known and admired film of forever more. The Wizard of Oz is the pinnacle motion picture of many of our childhoods, for we saw it at a very young age and it augmented our lives and points of view. Some consider it their favorite film, others consider it a icon feast, I however see it as the greatest fantasy one could embark on. This is one of the greatest tales ever told (both the movie and the original book) and every time I set my eyes upon it, I realize more and more how much I love this film and just how legendary it really is. The Wizard of Oz is THAT film, the film everyone has seen more than once and it's imagery and surroundings are very hard to rid from the mind. It's characters are relatable and very vivid to look at (Would you believe Bert Lahr's Lion costume was 90 pounds!) and the songs the characters chant are songs everyone can sing, for everyone has heard them so many times and know the lyrics by heart.But where The Wizard of Oz truly shines is in it's moral, that there is no place like home. Stated only once in Baum's original story, this quote has been the most prominent and well known movie quote ever spewed from a human mouth and it goes to show that no matter who you are and where you are, you always have a place to go to and people you can love and cherish. It's not about what kind of home it is, it's the fact that it's a home and it's a place where you can be who you want to be and relate with those most dear to you. It's the love and the warmth of being together that really matters and it's what Dorothy realizes at the very end of the film, that no matter how sepia toned her homelike is, she can be happy there and always love the things around her. That is one of the many reasons why this film is truly perfect in every sense of the word. Nah, it's not perfect, nothing is perfect, but this film is pretty darn spectacular and it's a film that will live on many, many, many, many, many years down the road, even after I am gone off the face of the Earth. This film is a tradition that generation to generation can savor and take to the heart and it's a film no one can deny, no one can get fed up with. It's the very film that gets you out of sadness and despair and into the realm of grandiose and fantastic nature. It's the film that gives us brains, gives us courage, gives us heart, gives us strength.That's all I have to say about that.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
REPLY TO ANONYMOUS IN BOSTON,"Hi! Just wanted to reply to the person who identified him/herself as ""Anonymous"" in Boston. You commented that you went to see the Wizard of Oz, and were disappointed that it wasn't shown in letterbox. This was not a mistake...the film played that way all over the US during its re-release. The reason is because ""OZ"" was not filmed in widescreen. Cinemascope did not exist in 1939, nor did any other widescreen film process. Hope you still enjoyed the film! It's a classic.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

I have books and magazines. There is a lot to say about the film that love but also aware of the negative behind the scenes moments that occurred. Yes, there are flaws in the movie I can point out, but after a while I don't care. The songs are iconic, the story is iconic, and it's very quotable through the decades.

You know these movies that parents watch and let their children do as well as if it's a family ritual or something (like ""Sound of Music"", ""Christmas Carol"", ""Home Alone"", etc...)To wrap it all, it's a movie that everybody else has seen, almost a 100 years old (I mean for God's sake it was made in 1939)!, it's one of the classics, so you just can't let it pass without you seeing it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Strange and Wonderful Musical Journey - A New Appreciation,"Dorothy has never gone away. In a new reincarnation, the glorious 1939 musical is back, remastered to be presented in 2013 3D IMAX technology, and what could have been another gimmick turns out to be quite an enhancement. It doesn't distract from the original masterpiece because every single element remains strong, as a reminder of what it made ""The Wizard"" such a landmark in the cinema world, especially outstanding because 1939 was probably one of the best years in cinema.There are so many elements to like in this film, from its very simple and touching story of a quest back home. In the story a simple Kansas girl travels to the land of her dreams, only to realize home is where the heart is. During her trip, she is joined by the most amazing friends she could have. She is accompanied by a smart friend, a sensitive friend, and a friend who needs a little more confidence. In other words, with her innocence and them, we have the perfect person.The marvelous score includes ""If I had only a brain, a heart... We're going to see the wizard... Follow the yellow brick road... If was king of the Forest"", never faltering, hitting the wrong notes. It is a great collection of tunes that easy to love, hum, and most importantly support and advance the story. Of course, ""Over The Rainbow"" leads the way into the wonderful world of Oz, and the rest of the score must keep up with the high standard of the classic.Who will ever fail to appreciate the flawless performances by Garland and her supporting team: Bolger, Hamilton... Everyone is wonderful. There are the amazing special effects, which even in the grandeur of the IMAX screen are still quite remarkable for the period. This movie is by all means, a treasure, a classic, something to be loved for the ages.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Excellent fantasy,"The following is a quote from another review on here, complete with spelling errors...""Hello friends. To many of you, these claims may be outrages but i hope and pray that you will take this into your heart. As many of you may know, The wizard of Oz is the classic tale of a small Kansas girl named Dorthy and her adventures in the magical land of Oz all to find a wizard who can take her home. But when you can look past all of that you can see the storys real, dark, meaning. It may shock you to know that the wicked witch of the west is actually a parody of Christianity, out cast and feared. Glenda, The good witch represents Satan, who may seem nice on the outside, but is actually out to get your soul. And of course, sweet innocent Dorthey is the modern heathen who is pulled away from Christianity by Satan. Also there is the Lion, the Tin man, and the Scare Crow an obvious mockery of the Trinity! But friends, it dose't end there, if you look closely enogh in one scene, You will see some munchkins sacrifice a virgin on an alter! I am appauld that they show this movie in schools to CHILDREN! So I urge you to throw out any Wizard of Oz related items you may have and instead READ THE BIBLE. It is a great book written by the best aurthor ever!""End of quote. Whew!I believe in the Bible as much as anyone, but why oh why do so many ""thumpers"" insist on ramming it down peoples throats? I suppose they don't realize they're doing the exact opposite of what they're attempting to accomplish. Good Lord, get a life.The Wizard of Oz is a timeless classic. Period. End of story.

A Whiz Of A Wiz If Ever A Wiz There Was,"When you've got a classic film that several generations of fans eagerly look forward to seeing televised every year, what critics say doesn't really matter. Several generations of the movie going public have made their voices heard loud and clear. It doesn't even matter that not one member of the cast is still with us to occasionally promote the film. It's reputation precedes it.What lucky accidents for two performers in the celebrated cast. First Judy Garland got her break because Darryl Zanuck would not loan Shirley Temple out at any price. She was just making more money for hi studio than anyone else in Hollywood and he wasn't going to cut Louis. B. Mayer in for a dime.However when MGM contract player Buddy Ebsen had a toxic allergic reaction to that Tin Man makeup paint, there was Zanuck happy to loan Jack Haley to MGM for what turned out to be his career role. In fact all seven of the stars, Judy Garland and her adult co-stars all got the roles they are most identified with. Tell me another film that can claim that?Back at the turn of the last century L. Frank Baum adapted his Oz stories to the Broadway stage in 1903. Baum wrote the play and also most of the song lyrics, none of which had any staying power. The great vaudeville team of David Montgomery and Fred Stone starred on Broadway for 293 performances. Stone played the Scarecrow and I could see him doing it, though not quite the same as Ray Bolger, Stone played all kinds of rustics when he later went to Hollywood. Montgomery played a character name I had not heard of, in fact if you look down a cast list on the Internet Broadway Database, you'll see a ton of characters you wouldn't be familiar with unless you read all the Baum Oz stories.MGM simplified and cut away a lot to bring what nearly all moviegoers on the planet are familiar with today. Included is new music which brought for The Wizard Of Oz it's two Oscars, for MGM house composer Herbert Stothart one for best musical scoring and for Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg for Over The Rainbow, Best Song of 1939.That song almost didn't make the picture. In his infinite wisdom Louis B. Mayer pronounced the number as too much for a juvenile like Judy Garland, it belonged to someone like Nelson Eddy. Director Victor Fleming insisted it be kept in and the result was an Oscar and a song that Judy Garland could never do a live performance without. Though her voice and persona changed from winsome juvenile to the greatest female singing star ever, Over The Rainbow adapted itself over the years to her aging.Judy's now over that rainbow for many years as are Ray Bolger, Jack Haley, Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lion, Billie Burke as Glinda the Good Witch. Margaret Hamilton who scares the waste product out anybody as the Wicked Witch of the West. Kids even now when first seeing her have nightmares, I can speak from first hand experience there. We can't leave out traveling medicine showman and the title character Frank Morgan. To think all these people in one film got their career roles.For their time the special effects were breathtaking, from the tornado that took Dorothy Gale and her house over the rainbow to the mystical land of Oz. The camera work of Hal Rosson and the imagination of Buddy Gillespie in the MGM special effects department hold our rapt attention to this day.Back when she was starting the terrible twos, my niece Tara got to see The Wizard Of Oz for the first time. At that point for the next three years it became her ultimate babysitting tool. You sat her in front of the television, plopped in The Wizard Of Oz and just left her alone. She wouldn't move, but it got so bad that her parents and both grandmothers just got totally Wizarded out and couldn't look at the film for years.Knowing there's a Tara out there as I write this who is getting her first exposure to the Wizard Of Oz, this review is dedicated to her and all the youngsters like her and untold millions that will follow.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
We welcome you to munchkin land!,"Wizard of Oz, is it even possible for anyone to not see this film? It's such a huge part of our pop culture, the picture, the sounds, the songs, the characters, the story. When you see the movie, you absolutely fall in love with it instantly, just because of it's magical charm. It makes you laugh, cry, and just realize maybe those little moments you realize you didn't mean what you said in anger. This is also such a beautifully made film, the colors were just so elegant, not to mention for 1939, how incredibly vibrant it was. The characters are just so lovable, how could you not fall for them? Dorothy, Scarecrow, the Cowardly Lion, and the Tin Man along with a great supporting cast made this the most memorable and cherished classic.Dorothy is just a young girl in Kansas with her dog, Toto, and she lives with her Aunt and Uncle on the farm. When she learns that the nasty next door neighbor wants to get rid of Toto because of his barking, she runs away with him, but when she realizes she must come back home, there is a nasty tornado. The tornado lifts the house up with her in it and lands her in the world of Oz, but she learns that her house landed on the wicked witch of the east, the munchkins that she is greeted by worship her. Glenda, the good witch of the north, welcomes her as well, but the celebration is stopped when the wicked witch of the west wants Dorothy dead, but since Dorothy is wearing her sister's ruby red slippers(a gift from Glenda), she cannot harm Dorothy. But Dorothy knows she must go home, Glenda sends her to meet the wizard who will help her. On her journey to the Emerald City, she meets a scarecrow who is scared to death of fire and doesn't have a brain, he wants to come too to get a brain from the wizard. They meet the Tin Man next who has no heart, he wishes to go to the wizard to get a heart. Then they meet the Cowardly Lion who wishes to have some courage and asks if he could ask the wizard for it. Together they are on a journey to get what they want, but it won't be easy with an evil witch on their tale.This movie has practically every memorable line that you can imagine, memorable songs, just all in all, I know in some way or another if you haven't seen this film, you just know about it. It's such a magical film that will always bring back pleasant memories for me, I just love this movie. I will always recommend it, not just because of what it is, but seriously, it's just hard not to love the film. Everyone could relate to it in some way and it just touches your heart. It's a great movie that will remain a treasured classic for years and years to come.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Outstanding; Legendary Performances and Production,"If I had never seen this movie before, I would have been speechless. I don't want to overdo the praise I have for this movie, because I wouldn't want to make you think it's better than it is. But it really is very, very good indeed and when you consider the date it was made (1939), a production like this is of the very highest quality. I am surprised it didn't sweep up more Oscars but I'm glad that Judy Garland received some quality recognition as a fine performer in this movie.All the acting is superb and nobody is badly cast. Yes, these were the good old days, days when acting was the supreme thing and if you couldn't act very well, you could not hope to make it. Judy Garland was the very best of the best. She could act very well, she could sing beautifully, she could dance and keep you very entertained. She was excellent and her performance in this film is merely an example of her extreme amount of natural ability. It is indeed a great shame that her life was such a tragedy and I can hardly believe she never won an Oscar. But her friends are all outstanding too, especially Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lion. His performance shines the most in my opinion, but it would be unwise not to say that Ray Bolger and Jack Haley are just as naturally gifted. The characters these three portray are some of the finest and most infamous in movie history and rightly so. They are an absolute pleasure to watch. Margaret Hamilton is very good as the witch, especially her vocal work. Her cackle and a plenteous amount of her words ring in your ears afterwards.The story is great and will be enjoyed by both children and adults. The scenery and production is fantastic and can hardly be improved, even to this day. I was staggered. This must have been a very expensive movie to make. It's a real triumph of Cinema.This film certainly deserves to be classed amongst the greatest films of all time. I'm glad it is on the Top 250 list of IMDb. If you've never seen it, it's a real treat for movie and acting-lovers and most of us on IMDb seem to think so.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
'The Wizard of Oz',"'The Wizard of Oz' is a fictional tale about a young woman, Dorothy, and her dog, Toto, who find themselves in a fictional dreamland; and their journey to return home. Along their journey, Dorothy and her dog find stragglers who end up being of some importance to the whole. The broad, overall message or underlying theme of the movie is a memorable quote; ""There's no place like home."" Even more interesting, though, is the amazing symbolism in the movie. The entire movie is symbolic of the lifestyle in America regarding social, political, and economic lifestyles of the 1890's. Strangely enough, L. Frank Baum, the author of the Wizard of Oz, which the movie was made about, claimed he never intended the book to be about the socialistic problems of the United States, but rather a child's story. It wasn't until later, that the general public learned of his true motives. The movie starts out with Dorothy and her family, which is the standard representational figure for the hardworking people of America in the 1890's. The tornado comes in and swoops up Dorothy and drops her in the magical dreamland known as Oz. Oz is symbolic of America, where there's ton of opportunity awaiting. The yellow brick road is symbolic of the gold standard, which was what the American dollar was backed by. Dorothy, while in Oz, represented the hard working common man. The Scarecrow represented the farmers of America, who were without a brain to realize that they held the power as they were the food source for America and did not realize they were being stepped on by the big politicians. The Tin-man stood for the steel workers, as they were the ones who needed a heart to have compassion for the American people instead of the money they made through industrialization. The cowardly Lion represented the local politicians who needed the courage to stand up for the American people. The wicked witch of the east and west stood for the national bank, as well as big banks in general. The evil monkeys stood for the local banks as they did the big banks bidding; mere puppets of the big bank. The Emerald City is symbolic of Washington D.C., where the President resides, the Wizard. ""No one gets to see the Wizard."" The reason why is because the President was a busy man, and to see him at the time, took a little bit of bribery and important contacts to put in the good word. The giant head in the Wizard's chamber was the general public's idea of who controlled America, but the giant head never wanted you to see who really controlled the politicians; hence the reason why he didn't want Dorothy and the gang to look behind the curtain.The other great piece of symbolism, which also served as ground breaking technology, was the opening scene's transition from the humble farm in Kansas (black and white), to the wonderful dreamland of Oz (in color). The black and white represents bleakness, and sets the tone for the poverty settings that the family was in. The scenery portrays the plains of Kansas with dust surrounding them, and barely any shrubs. All of a sudden, the tornado picks them up to Oz, portrayed in color; showing how vibrant the world can be and hope and optimism for a better future. This optimistic idea is only heightened after the audience realizes that the wicked witch of the east was killed by the house Dorothy resided in, dropped on her and the famous ruby red slippers. In a way, this symbolizes the death of the national banks, and it's corruption over the political scene of the United States. It really brings a new meaning to ""dropping the house"" on something.At the end of the movie, Dorothy returns to Kansas with her dog, Toto, and finds that ""there's no place like home."" She realizes the simplicity of life on the farm, and how one can get caught up in the politics of the world; especially after how frustrating it can be to get policy done (i.e.: getting to the Emerald City, finding the wizard, stopping the wicked witch of the west, and returning Oz to its normal, happy state; then finally returning home). We take a look around the room and outside the room, and realize that there is a bit more shrubbery. The music sets a deeper, more happy tone, and Dorothy seems to favor her Aunt, and Uncle. The moral of the story is that ""there's no place like home,"" but also that you don't really know what you have until it's gone. Change is essential to life, especially when we live in a corrupt society like in the 1890's, but do not try to wish away the good out of the bad because sometimes, the good is all we have to hold onto to get us through the bad.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

"""Poor little kid, I hope she gets home alright""","Professor Marvel needn't have worried about Dorothy. She had what another screen icon displayed in an equally memorable role 30 years later: True grit.The 'true grit' that Mattie Ross admires in Rooster Cogburn was something she also possesses and I find a lot of similar character traits in Mattie and Dorothy. In 1939, audiences then loved Garland's performance as the girl who survives falling into a pigpen,losing her dog,riding out a tornado,then has to battle a witch and an obstreperous wizard on her journey back home. I mention the Duke because her Dorothy and his Rooster role both netted them Oscars in their somewhat similar careers. Her Oscar was a smaller honorary statuette (which she called a ""Munchkin"" award) given for her work as Dorothy. The Duke's Oscar was close to an honorary one also. It was far from his best work and his other nominations for THE ALAMO and SANDS OF IWO JIMA were much beneath his better efforts in RED RIVER, THE QUIET MAN and THE SEARCHERS, just to name a few. I think the older members of the Academy voting the awards wanted to give Wayne the prize for his body of work to that point, partly because they were a bit shocked at the popularity of THE MIDNIGHT COWBOY, an X-rated film that garnered best actor nominations for Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight. I think the Academy knew they both had long careers facing them and would be up again for awards, and they do have 3 Oscars and 11 nominations between them. The other two actors up for the award then were equally deserving. Richard Burton had received his sixth Oscar nomination and went on to a record seven nominations without wins and Peter O'Toole had picked up his fourth nomination and just this year broke Burton's record with his 8th non-winning nomination. I'm sure a lot of the voting members felt O'Toole and Burton more deserving of the Oscar, but sentiment for the aging Duke won out and it was probably a very narrow margin of votes that carried the day. While the Duke's Oscar came near the end of his career, Judy's came when she was just getting started. But like Wayne's Rooster role, her most honored and beloved screen character represents just the tip of an iceberg. She earned two other Oscar nominations and sold a lot of records and was a popular TV performer. As John Wayne could never overcome his western/war hero screen persona (and probably never really would have given that up), Garland was never able to find a plum part like Dorothy again either. That's not to say she went totally downhill from there. By all accounts, she had an outstanding career, plagued though it was by personal troubles. But Dorothy put her star up in the cosmos and she could never reach that high again. Her plucky character and her memorable friends and foes in the enchanting world of Oz set this film apart as one of the greatest of all time and deservedly so.I just saw this on the big screen at my neighborhood Garland Theatre. Although like millions of others who had seen this on television more than once, it was still a great story brought to life by the magic of cinema. I don't know if I suddenly became allergic to popcorn, but the climax brought tears to my eyes. Few films do that for me and I was surprised at my reaction to what I thought was an old chestnut I'd seen more times than I can remember. Maybe I'm just getting old and decrepit and overly sentimental for the good old days or maybe it's because this film can still carry a powerful message to new generations seeing it anew. I'd like to believe it's more of the latter than the former. Dale Roloff",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Off to the yellow brick road.,"The Wizard of Oz is without a doubt one of the most iconic movies in cinema history, a tale about Dorothy Gale being swept away by a tornado to a magical land, where she is joined by the Cowardly Lion, the Tin Man and the Scarecrow. Together they seek the Wizard to help Dorothy find her way home, going down the famous yellow brick road. Along the way, Dorothy and her friends encounter the famous Good Witch Glinda and the lovable munchkins. They are thwarted by villains, which became some of cinema's most recognizable characters, including the Wicked Witch of the West and the flying monkeys.It's a film full of music and songs, including the famous ""Over the Rainbow,"" magic, vibrant color, adventure and whimsical scenes. I watched this movie for its iconic status and the good vs. evil scenes, which I thought were pretty entertaining. The characters were memorable, some if a bit whiny and annoying, and the plot makes you suspend reality and lets your imagination run wild. The special effects were great for its time and the lavishness in the sets, costume design and cinematography helped create a convincing Land of Oz.Some might be taken-back by the overly-sung musical numbers, over-hyped sappiness and whimsicalness, and the slowness of the plot at some points, but it's still a fun adventurous movie to enjoy.Grade B-",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Most important film ever made,"THE WIZARD OF OZ is one of my favorite films of all time and I will make this a short review.The plot follows the book very nicely and this movie is known for it's use of Technicolor, fantasy storytelling, musical score, amazing songs and unusual characters, but over the years it has become one of the best known of all films and part of American popular culture.The film also featured what may be the most elaborate use of character make-up effects and special effects in a film up to that time.This was MGM's most expense production up to that time, having a budget of just $2 million dollars and earned only $3 million dollars, but due to re-releases, the film has grossed a lot more and has also been showed on TV, as well including Cartoon Network, TCM, TBS and TNT.The story is just wonderful and the 1939 film, follows the book nicely and it was really amazing to see and the song ""Over the Rainbow"" won an Oscar for best original song and was ranked first in the AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs list.The performances in this film are great. The late actors, Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, Terry the Dog as Toto, Ray Bolger, Jack Haley, Bert Lahr, Billie Burke, Margaret Hamilton, Charley Grapewin, Clara Blandick, the Singer Midgets as the Munchkins and Pat Walshe as the leader of the flying monkey and those performances are really fantastic in this film.The film is also named the most viewed motion picture All Time in various critics and popular polls including IMDb's Top 250 List and is the source of many memorable quotes referenced today in modern popular culture.It was directed by the late Victor Fleming, who also directed Gone With the Wind and the screenplay was written by Noel Langley, Florence Ryerson and Edgar Allan Woolf. The lyrics were written by E.Y. Harburg and music were composed by Harold Arlen.The make-up and visual effects are really amazing, but they are just cool and is fantastic, but really spectacular. The characters are all true to the way they are written in the book. My favorite characters in the film are The Scarecrow, The Tin Man, The Cowardly Lion, The Wicked Witch of the West, Glinda, the Good Witch of the North and The Flying Monkeys. I also love Dorothy and Toto.The way the movie is shot was just amazing and I have no problem with the film's cinematography because to me, this movie does not feel like it ages at all.Overall, I love THE WIZARD OF OZ. It is earned a right to be called ""a classic"". The film gets a 10 out of 10 and it really deserves to get that from me because I have no problem re-watching this one again also.This is one movie that really deserves to be remade and I would love a chance to direct a remake, or at least write the script and play the Scarecrow because he is a cool character. My version would be a 2 hour and 10 minute movie of the 1939 film and I would love a chance to remake it.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Excellent,"This is the classic children's film. I starred as the Cowardly Lion in a nearby theatre production and it was very, very inspirational. There have been so many different translations and opinions of this film, but honestly, it is one of the greatest films of all time. From the start, you are immediately ""sucked"" into the storyline, relating to Dorothy in those times in which you were neglected by people. THen as you are transported into this technicolor world, surrounded by short people and talking objects and creatures, you imagine a world that is perfect (except for the wicked witch of course) After seeing the movie, you are captivated by the imaginative world that has been created inside your mind. That is what a good movie is about, it's about being more than just a kid, but the most important person to a group of people. This makes up for the neglected childhood. :D",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Like a feature length episode of Barney and Friends,"I rewatched ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939) this week for the first time in ages, and was emphatically reminded about how much it sucked. It's basically a feature length episode of ""Barney and Friends"", with better production values. Performances are extremely exaggerated, which is intentional, but they are also insufferably awful and nauseating. This is the most obnoxious band of protagonists I've seen in a long time. So much so that it makes the film impossible to enjoy. Some of the songs are good, but some are garbage. Don't even get me started on the castle sequence. Good production isn't enough to elevate a film that is pathetic in nearly every other category.""Return To Oz"" (1985) is a far better film; and it's not even close. Better performances, better conflicts, better resolutions . . . better everything. This is much darker in tone and has some very creepy sequences too. It's also very creative and somewhat bizarre. The special effects are damn cool, especially the rock monsters. ""Return To Oz"" was a box office failure that was cast into the dust bin of forgotten films, while the vomit-inducing original is placed on a pedestal.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"chittenango, ny","This movie is a classic, I am surprised to read some of these comments. Apparently, some people forget how old it is? In the 50's, we could not wait to see this movie, especially once a year on TV. But, seeing it on the screen was awesome. Last week, we took our nephew to see it, and I was amazed at how many people never saw it on a big screen. Guess we were lucky, it only cost 5 cents. Anyway, I have not read all the comments, and most are from out of the country, but if anyone travels thru Chittenango, NY---it was the home of L Frank Baum. His grandson still lives there, and every year, they put on a spectacle. The first time we drove thru, I was amazed, to see all the streets, yes, paved with yellow bricks. The businesses? They all had names like; Dorothy's place, or Oz gift store (I don't actually remember what they are, even thought I'm 45 minutes away.) But again, if you are going thru upstate NY, central NY---it's really pretty, especially this time of year, in the fall. Speaking of falls, they also have a pretty waterfall. My husband and I still watch this movie on TV! And tho the movie was released in August, it has my birthday in June, when the book came out, so it's special to me. Now, if only more movies were like this. Better yet, life! (one of the munchkins looks like a cousin of mine.) 1939 was a great year for movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore, and there's no place like home, enough said a timeless classic!","After countless viewings ""The Wizard of Oz"" is still a timeless classic and cultural milestone as it still entertains with joy and thrill as a story of a girl trying to find her way home back to Kansas from the magical land of Oz all while making new friends is a wonderful and delightful journey to watch over and over. So much can be said about the film I must for one add that the technicolor and effects and sound made for a great musical for it's time of 1939 as the singing moved the film along just fine with ""Over the Rainbow"" being one of the best songs in movie history.The movie came about from a children's novel and short stories writer L. Frank Baum and the directing on screen was done by one Victor Fleming, really the film is a journey of escape and adventure of finding what you want and need with new friends all while facing evil. Dorothy Gale(the young and beautiful Judy Garland) is a Kansas farm girl who's bored and tired at home wanting for a change of pace and eager to see new land has her life swept away in a tornado to the magical land of Oz. Along the way it's a journey of new friends she meets that being the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion with the need and wanting for a home, brain, heart, and courage! The wild card and wicked subplot of the film is facing the mean and nasty Wicked Witch of the West(in a performance and frightening turn from Margaret Hamilton that terrified me as a child and still brings wonder and fear even today). Thru it all this picture tries to give a message that there's no place like home, yet I see it as a journey of seeing new lands, new challenges, and making new friends as leaving your own little nest opens a whole new world of adventure and possibility. Overall a timeless classic and clearly one of the best fantasy and adventure musical films ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""Anybody can have a brain, that is a very mediocre commodity.""","The Wizard of Oz is one of the films that changed the way I look at movies. First enjoying The 1939 film by Victor Fleming as a childhood favorite, revisiting the film, proved it to be so much more than a kid's movie. When I was about 20 and in college, I really started appreciating film as the art form that it is and respecting it as such. In gaining this new understanding for the medium as a serious art rather than mindless entertainment, I sought out favorite films of mine to see if I could gain any deeper understanding of them, and perhaps, appreciate or enjoy them more. One of the first films I watched through this new lens was The Wizard of Oz. Starring Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr, Jack Haley, and Billie Burke in the film adaptation of L. Frank Baum's book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz follows a small town girl into the world she discovers as she only wishes to return home to the life she didn't realize she loved. No matter how simple the film seems on its surface, Baum packed quite a punch in his book, which was more than adequately transferred to the screen.Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland) is a simple young girl living in Kansas on her Auntie Em's (Clara Blandick) and Uncle Henry's (Charley Grapewin) farm. Frustrated with her family after they agree to take her dog Toto away after nipping at a neighbor, Dorothy contemplates running away. When a tornado rips through the farm, she and her dog Toto are deposited into a magical world called Oz. Everything in Oz is different and beautiful. There is a unique class of people called munchkins, there are talking scarecrows, and tin woodsmen, there are witches, there are even lions and tigers and bears. The more Dorothy learns about the land of Oz, the more she wants to find a way to go back home, as soon as she can. In order to get back home, the Good Witch of the North, Glinda (Billie Burke) instructs Dorothy that she will need to travel to Emerald City and request to go home of the Wizard of Oz (Frank Morgan). In order to get there, Dorothy must follow the yellow brick road, that leads all the way to The Emerald Palace where the Wizard lives. To protect herself through the travels, Dorothy is given a pair of Ruby slippers, much sought after by the Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton) who will stop at nothing to get them. Fortunately for Dorothy, she meets friends along the way to Emerald City. She meets a talking scarecrow, who wishes to ask the Wizard for a brain, a tin woodsman who is seeking a heart from the Wizard, and a talking lion who wishes to be granted courage from the Wizard. Each with a special request and believing only that the Wizard of Oz can fulfill them, they travel along the yellow brick road hoping to be granted their destinies. In a race against the wicked witch, the group hopes to reach the Wizard of Oz before being thwarted by evil.There are a number of technical achievements that The Wizard of Oz boasts, of these is probably the most beautiful revealing transformation scene in cinema history. One would struggle to find someone unfamiliar with the door first opening to Oz revealing the technicolor wonder revealed to the audience. There is a good reason that this reveal is so engrained in the hearts of audiences forever. The coloration used in The Wizard of Oz is not only striking for 1939 but is still striking today, nearly 80 years after the film's release. It was also the brilliant transition from the sepia tones that the film had used until Dorothy entered Oz. This was a brilliant directorial decision to contrast the bleak simple world Dorothy had known until she was thrust into the world greatly different than her own. Many times since has this device been copied in films proving that so many filmmakers and film genres have much to owe to The Wizard of Oz. In addition to the beautiful shooting of the film, the writing comes to mind instantly as a standout piece of the film. I struggle to think of another film as quoted as The Wizard of Oz, from the exclamation of the Wicked Witch when she promises Dorothy ""I'll get you my pretty"" to the realization Dorothy has when landing in Oz ""Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore"", no other film has been imitated and quoted as much as The Wizard of Oz.The Wizard of Oz also comes with it, quite a thematic punch. Brimming to the top with symbolism, The Wizard of Oz really opened my eyes to how much cinema can say without overtly saying it. Each of the main characters means something deep and different than it would appear on screen, and there is room for each audience member to see what they will in each character. Just like going to an art gallery and 40 people seeing 40 different aspects of the same painting, film creates the same opportunities to see something deep and beautiful within it, if you only look for it. Whether you see industry titans in the tin man, politicians in the lion, farmers in the scarecrow, or the exploited working class in the munchkins; film has within it as much depth as any other art medium. The Wizard of Oz was my first introduction to film as art, and I am eternally grateful for what a viewing of a favorite film with a fresh perspective has afforded me for my years to come. I suppose I was somewhat like Dorothy before she opened the door to Oz, comfortable and unknowing; I'm glad for both of us that the door to that technicolor world has been opened.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Number 1 Family Genre Film of All Time !,"Firstly, i would say that Victor Fleming is the best director in his generation. No one on par on how beautiful a movie can be if directed by him. Any film directed by him always have a stunning art- direction and marveolus cinematography with adaptive actor/actress performances. And i would say also he was one of the legendary director that Hollywood ever had.The Wizard of Oz. A hundred percent, no other family-genre film had reach the level of this movie, even a small piece until now. Only one movie that i know which nearly reach the level of this film as a fantasy-genre, it is ""Pan's Labyrinth"".By wide aspect, TWOO have a deep and inspiring storyline. It is enjoyable by any age range and also enjoyable by any generation- time. The art- direction is by far, the no.1 in 1939 since any movie ever made in the past, and it also superb nowadays. Then if we see into detailed aspect, any costume-design, make-up, and set-decoration are undoubtedly extraordinary. This film, set a new standard model for color-movies in 1939. This movie is a predecessor for color-movies after 1939.Victor Fleming genuinely using suitable style direction for color- movies, yet technicolor also beautiful. Fleming means to separate Dorothy's real life with Dorothy's world in Oz, so he using two style of coloring (technicolor and color). These will drive the viewers to feel how the true fantasty-film is. No director ever used that style before Fleming, it was absolutely genius and trend-set.Any act performed by actors/actresses was incredibly natural. They likely fit with the film itself and had use to live inside the film already. I must tell that to perform in a fantasy-genre needs something that people called it a ""talent"". Actors and actresses need high level of imagination and creativity to perform any role in fantasy-genre. In TWOO, there were no miss act by all role. That was unbelievable.I can's say anymore. This movie definitely will amaze any people who watch it. As fantasy-genre, this movie extraordinary beautiful, as family-genre, this movie truly inspiring and highly enjoyable.

A definite whiz of a wiz....,"Easily one of the top films of all time, this infectiously charming and meticulously crafted musical has become legendary and runs deep in the blood of anyone who saw it as a child and revisits it as an adult.  Garland plays a rather restless Kansas farm girl living with her aunt and uncle and pouring her feelings out to her beloved dog Toto.  The local crankpot is bound and determined to send Toto away to be destroyed for such grievous crimes as chasing her cat and running through her garden (and also snipping at her decidedly untasty leg!)  Just as Garland realizes that she has to face up to her challenges and responsibilities (after briefly running away) a tornado hits and she is konked on the head.  She awakens to an entirely different world (called Oz) in which great beauty is tempered by even greater evil.  She finds herself at odds with the Wicked Witch of the West (Hamilton) who will stop at nothing to destroy her (and her little dog, too!) while she desperately tries to reach the title character whom she hopes will get her back to Kansas.  Along the way to the Wizard of Oz, she is joined by a trio of equally needy friends.  The Scarecrow requires brains, the Tin Man wants a heart and the Cowardly Lion longs for courage. Together, they brave the Witch's scare tactics and set out to achieve their personal goals.  It turns out that the foursome always had the things they desired, they just never really realized it.  This is a rather clinical deconstruction of what is a magical and psychologically affecting tale. The story works on many levels and contains endless parallels (driven home by the fact that many of the people in Garlands home life appear as the characters in Oz.)  It's observation of human desires and needs could be dissected for hours.  Beyond that, the entire film is jaw-droppingly beautiful (even the ""drab"" opening and closing sequences shot in a sepia tone.)  With expert talent involved in the production (Cedric Gibbons, Adrian anyone?), it's an eye-popper throughout and an aural delight as well. The songs (with peerless tongue-twisting lyrics) approach Gilbert & Sullivan greatness at times with Garland's unforgettable rendition of ""Over the Rainbow"" just one of many gems.  All of the acting is top-notch. Garland's portrayal works because she completely buys into the story.  She believes and so the audience believes.  Her almost unfailing optimism gains greater irony when compared with her own troubled life.  Bolger, Haley and Lahr forge an iconic, thoroughly enjoyable trio, each getting the chance to show off his considerable comedic and musical talent.  Morgan plays virtually everyone of note in Oz and gives great presence to each characterization.  Toto is one of the true great screen canines.  It's impossible not to root for him as he scampers across rough terrain to find help for his owner.  The real blood-curdler here, however, is Hamilton. She crafts a character so vile, so menacing and so relentlessly evil that it's hard to ponder anyone else in the role.  Every gesture, every inflection of her voice seems calculated to drive kids under the covers (and has....for generations.)  Someone bitter or bored, with no sense of awe, may find ways to pick at the story or the technical aspects of a film that's more than 60 years old, but most everyone will be enchanted by (and moved by) this one of a kind piece of film history.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
I really hate to give it such a low score but........,".....look it's not so much the movie I dislike I mean I really do like this movie and will continue to like it, but the thing that really make me clinch my fist is the movie's phenomenon. In a way one of the most famous movies of all time has really made the world blind to the true magic that Oz has to offer. How many people do you now who have read the books? Not very many right? The books are just fantastic (most of the time). But for some reason whenever someone tries to adapt closer to the books (AKA 1985 Return to Oz) people are to harsh to it. Leonard Malton and Siskel and Ebert hated that movie because it wasn't the 1939 version. Granted over time people have realized the magic behind the books and Return to Oz (Seriouly I'm like the only one who likes that movie was better the then this one) and I'm sure the years to come people will grow attached as well. So just a recap, I like this movie always have and always will. But at the same time I think it's a little on the overrated side. If you haven't read the book or seen Return to Oz I strongly suggest you do so, it's time to know the truth.P.S.: I hate it when other adaptations winks to the audience with references to this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Kids today.,"Kids today are weak, they play video games from the couch and cry when mommy doesn't buy the right kind of sugar cereal. The fact that ""The Wizard of Oz"" sits so low on the IMDb top 250 list is a testament to the young, immature users that have clearly flooded the gates here on this website. The fact that it has been beaten by such works as ""Memento"" and ""The Dark Knight"" is laughable.I watched this last night for the first time in years. I had forgotten how well this film was done; arguably the most visually stunning of our time. The way Dorothy's whole world is black and white and then she enters Oz, full of color. To think that this came out back in 1939 is a trip. I can't imagine the first people to see this film. They must have been completely blown away. You just can't amaze like that anymore. All you can do as a viewer is try to put yourself back there and if you can do that, you can appreciate this film and all its glory.I had forgotten how scary some of the sequences are here. I think it was smart that they lightened the story a bit for the big screen and made it more for kids. It's plenty dark and grimy for my tastes. Those flying monkeys haunted my sleep when I was a kid and who can forget the melting wicked witch of the West? Or her sister's feet shriveling up when the ruby slippers disappear? Or the evil trees in the forest, grabbing the apple back from Dorothy? Made in a time when kids played outside, got bruises, black eyes, worked at age 14 and lived in the midst of World Wars, ""The Wizard of Oz"" is certainly a wild, undeniably groundbreaking and brilliant film. I recommend seeing this one again so you can remember what real, beautiful film making is all about.10 out of 10, kids.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not quite up to date in its message but still worth watching,"Not growing up in the United States, my primary reason to watch this movie was because Pink Floyd made Dark Side of the Moon... I guess you know the story.*** The following text primarily discusses the messages this movie has without telling any plot elements. If you consider that a spoiler, stop reading ***About the movie: Well... for my taste the story is way too simple and unfolds too slowly. And, one main message is ""There is no place like home"". I think there are way too many people living too long with their parents, (possibly including me some day), and those should not get false encouragement. On the other hand ""You already have everything in yourself, you don't need a wizard"" is useful. Also, a confident woman as the protagonist in a movie, which is not a ""love/relationship-movie"", is still a rather rare sight nowadays. But, all in all the characters are way too simple for my taste. While they work well for delivering the primary messages of the movie, there are nearly no hidden, underlying, secondary themes or messages to think about, unless you count quotes such as ""But sometimes people without brains talk a lot! - Yes I guess that is true...""(When Dorothy meets the scarecrow) . Also, what conclusion is a child supposed to make when it is told good-looking=good, ugly=evil... And, there were more questionable plot elements: - Why put up an hour glass, when it has no meaning at all? - Why are the antagonists so stupid and laugh all the time? - It is extremely unimaginative story wise that Dorothy kills the ""bad guy"" with luck!And, most importantly: Why does the evil witch need to be killed at all? A peaceful solution would have been way more appropriate. I think this is really sending a wrong message to kids, especially considering the current world situation....Don't get me wrong, I can see that this was a great movie in its time, but I can understand it very well if younger people do not find it interesting, and in my opinion there really are better movies with similar messages out there, for example ""Spirited Away"".",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

We know the bad people are bad because they are gray (or green)and black colored. The songs are boring. The lessons are commonplace; similar to what you could read in a fortune cookie.

It makes the old feel young again and the young feel like they can live forever. As for the film itself, it's a skillful film. Judging by today's standards, the special effects hold up very well.

It's biggest star is Judy Garland who found fame because of this film. Garland does a very good job and she is what makes Dorothy a classic character.Overall, the Wizard of Oz is the perfect film for the entire family and it will live on for generations to come. My favorite part is how this film masterfully transfers from black/white to color film. Filmmakers hardly used color back in the old days, but I'm glad they did here.

"The Wizard of Oz, An American Treasure","The Wizard of Oz is an American classic undoubtedly. The movie makes you feel as if you are in this magical world along side Dorothy, as if you are lost as well. Everything from the characters, music, set design, and story line makes us fall in love. The Cowardly Lion, Scarecrow, and Tin-man seem like old friends and are easy to relate to. They each touch on a fear that most people have on some level. The Cowardly Lion shows fear (in general) and uncertainty. The Tin-man shows vulnerability with oneself and emotions. And the Scarecrow lacks self-worth dealing with intelligence. And even Dorothy, she represents the fear of being lost, and leaving your comfort zone. The characters help the audience connect to the movie more, and become more emotionally invested. Not only is the characterization great in this movie, but just looking at the it all is nothing less than beautiful. The elaborate sets and colorful images makes your eyes dance around the screen. This movie was made when color was first still being introduced, and even though it wasn't the first colored movie, it definitely was the first that really took advantage of the use of color.

"Classic fairy tale with dazzling fantasy , colorful images , impressive songs and enjoyable roles","Marvelous tale in which Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland , she had to wear a painful corset-style device around her torso so that she would appear younger and flat-chested) is swept away to a magical location in a tornado and being transported on the land of Oz she embarks on a quest to see the Wizard (Frank Morgan , he plays various characters) who can help her return home . The film opens in sepia-tone academy ratio for the Kansas scenes, before widening out and blooming into full color in Oz . There appears Dorothy and her dog when she is hurled away from dusty Kansas to the vibrant Land of Oz. She's helped by the Good Witch of the North (Billie Burke) , but she's also in trouble with the Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton, many of her scenes were either trimmed or deleted entirely, her performance was thought too frightening for audiences) . Reluctantly drawn into the problems facing the Land of Oz and its inhabitants, Dorothy must find out who is good and who is evil before it is too late. On her way she meets the Munchkins (they are portrayed by the Singer Midgets, named not for their musical abilities ,the troupe came from Europe to immigrate and escape the Nazis) , a Scarecrow (Ray Bolger , face makeup wore consisted, in part, of a rubber prosthetic with a woven pattern to suggest cloth) who needs a brain, a Tin Man (Jack Haley who wrote additional dialogue) who wants a heart, and a Cowardly Lion (Bet Lahr , he wrote additional dialogue , too) who desperately needs courage . Putting their arts to use through illusion, ingenuity-and even a bit of wizardry they transform themselves not only into the great and powerful helpers of Oz but into the better friends as well .This is an agreeable film for children of all ages based on the all-time classic by Frank Baum . This engrossing picture contains powerful ,haunting images and immortal songs ,in fact the song ""Over the Rainbow"" was ranked #1 by the American Film Institute in 2004 on the 100 Greatest Songs in American Films list . Beautiful scenery , colorful cinematography by Harold Rosson , spirited adventure and a stirring climax lift this story . It is a genuine as well as imaginative tale written and directed with great sensibility , fairness and imagination.

Sympathetic support cast such as Ray Bolger , Billy Burke , Charles Grapewin , Jack Haley , Frank Morgan and Margaret Hamilton as witch ; among others . Spectacular and glamorous sets , production designer Cedric Gibbons studied the films of Walt Disney classic films to achieve the appropriate Art Deco design for the Emerald City of Oz . The film was completely shot in studio , the only location footage in the entire film are the clouds over the opening titles . The director opted to use practical sets in conjunction with matte painting . The motion picture was stunningly directed by Victor Fleming , though supported by other notorious as well as uncredited filmmakers such as George Cukor , Norman Taurog , King Vidor and Mervyn LeRoy , also producer . However , Richard Thorpe, the original director of the film, had shot around two weeks of footage before he was fired . A recent study claimed that this is the most watched movie in film history, largely due to the number of television screenings each year as well as video which has enabled children of every generation to see it.This story about OZ has been adapted several times such as : An old and mute version (1925) , this classic and the best rendition , the MGM release ¨The wizard of Oz¨ (1939) by Victor Fleming with Judy Garland , remade in 1978 as ¨The Wiz¨ by Sidney Lumet with Diana Ross , Richard Pryor and Michael Jackson and ¨Return to Oz¨ (1985) by Walter Murch with Fauriza Falk ,Nicol Williamson, Matt Clark and Piper Laurie .

Classic,"Greetings from Lithuania.Surely it is impossible to review a movie like ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939) when first time seeing it in 2022 - 83 years after it was released. I don't think this movie aged that well, but probably this is my cynical heart is speaking. On the other hand i could easily vote this movie a 10/10 because i believe that people who saw i back at its initial release were blown away by the experience. Yet like i said as seen today for a first time one can only admire it.Overall, ""The Wizard of Oz"" is surely is a Hollywood product of its time.

What i have to say is the story is very well written although some of the effects might be poor if seen by audience who have watched 20th century effects setting.Judy was a wonderful teenager at that time and her ability to sing and dance make this movie very exciting.Nice costumes and setting, very imaginative props.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Stop being sick on my face,"I watched this back in the day when I was single digits and it went in one ear and out the other. I couldn't remember anything about it except the tornado sequence. I watched it again in my 20's and 30's mainly at Xmas as you're forced to at that time. Still I couldn't understand all the fuss. Now, nearly 50 years old I can categorically state this film is aWFul. Yes, it is like a dream, a forgettable one and as a fantasy more like a bad acid trip. There is nothing 'heart warming' about it. Those that find that must be psychopathic. The acting is flat, including the 'famous' Judy Garland and the more she and the other stars over-act the flatter it becomes. None of the characters are likable or interesting and the whole experience is like someone being sick on your face. The fairy from the north is more ugly and disgusting than the wicked witch of the east and the dog Toto out acts them all. The only good part was when the tree slapped Dorothy for pinching an apple. THAT was the only cool thing in it. And that only probably 'cause you wanna slap her yourself for being such a precocious non starter",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Movie for Everybody,"I recently saw this movie again after a hiatus of several years. I was able to view it with a more objective eye; the movie didn't disappoint.Two facts stick out at me when pondering this film. First, it creates the hugest impact when the viewer sees it as a child. I still remember trembling at the Wicked Witch of the West at the tender age of seven. To a child, the Witch is terrifying--she'll scare the living Beejeesus out of him. The underlying subconscious motives of children are all addressed, in a most direct fashion, in this movie--the desire to get away, the loss of security, our feelings towards our Mothers (the Antie Em figure) and our fear of scary things. Nothing could possibly be more horrifying to a child than the crystal ball sequence, where our beloved Mother figure (Antie Em) turns into this horrible, cackling, Id-figure Witch.People who see the movie first as an adult are less impressed; one acquaintance said,""The movie's no big deal--you're not missing much."" They have missed the child's Wizard of Oz experience and can't understand the impact.The other fact that strikes me is that this movie is truly Pan-Human--there's absolutely nothing in the film that would offend anyone, whether he be Muslim, Jewish, Christian, African, Russian, Chinese, or green or blue or purple. It truly is a film that transcends all human boundaries.There are a few plot holes in the film made necessary by cutting the film due to over-length. I wish I could see an unabridged edition; Margaret Hamilton has said that her part was cut drastically because the children in preview audiences got too scared. I believe, in retrospect, the deletion of the Jitterbug number was a mistake; its deletion causes a glaring plot hole, obvious to those who watch the movie closely.A little piece of errata--I remember very clearly a scene in the Witch's Castle that is either lost, or been deleted. It's when Dorothy is gazing at the hourglass. Seeing that the sand is getting ready to run out, she desperately tries to turn it over--but fails; the hourglass won't budge. Does anybody else remember this scene?All in all, this is a wonderful movie. If you and your children haven't seen it, run--not walk-- to the nearest store and buy it.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
timeless classic fantasy,"I was always interested in fantasy movies and after watching this one it has become truly my favorite one, even tho I watched it quite late, in the age of 25. The Wizard of Oz is a timeless classic and I just loved it. The story is about Judy Garland who plays Dorothy and is traveling to the land of Oz where she meets with Lion and the Scarecrow with who she has plenty of adventures and to battle the forces of evil. The writing and dialogues in the film are so fresh that you will be surprised. you will never have read or heart anything like this.

A classic film for people of all ages to see,"I recently watched The Wizard of Oz again after not seeing it for a while. It is interesting to see how a movie made back then is still appealing to so many people, and as an adult (I was introduced to the movie as a kid) I can see how some songs like ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow"" are still recognized by many people, if not as well-known as before. It is also quite common for the movie to be featured in trivia, and when watching it again I noticed how it's made an impact on our culture (I've heard the expression ""you won't melt"" before, there's a small street named ""Yellow Brick Road"" in my town). The Wizard of Oz is showing its age (you can tell everything is painted, special effects we're used to seeing in newer movies weren't invented yet, and the entertainment style is old-fashioned). I've noticed a drop in the number of people who know this movie and some of our other classics like The Sound of Music (a movie made during the 1960's that has a story set during the late 1930's), but unlike other 70+ year old movies it hasn't been forgotten.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

This is what a bad hit of acid does to you.,"Okay, lets go over Dorothy's story one last time. She's a flying witch riding a bicycle, her house falls out of the sky into a magical place named Oz filled with lots of ""colors"" because it's over the rainbow. Oz is populated by a bunch of singing midgets called munchkins and they tell her to follow the yellow brick road where she meets a bunch of wacked-out characters that also sing and she has to fight off an evil witch and talking trees and flying monkeys so that she can see the great and powerful wizard (Timothy Leary) of Oz who can send her back to Kansas (cause it's so exciting there) via hot air balloon, but he fails so she clicks her ruby slippers together and wakes up. Just between you me and the wall I'd say Dorothy's been playing in the old mushroom patch again. This movie is okay when you're a kid but when you grow up you realize that it fits right in with Pink Flyod's the Wall, Dumbo, and Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas.

A magical moving picture that for me will never lose its lustre,"Like a lot of the people on this planet I have watched this film many times but in order to get some idea of the events leading up to its creation I looked at the trivia section on IMDb. How this film actually made it to the screen is just amazing and how it actually turns out is absolutely stunning when you read some of the problems there were in just arriving at the cast and main crew list. I find it curiously satisfying that the film turned out to be so magical. Not being in the position of knowing anyone who was around at the time the film was made I can only speculate why after all of the problems surrounding the making of this film it turned out the way it did. I choose to believe that it was down to the professional attitude of those who were involved. Maybe that is a dewy eyed attitude but the film was actually made and all the rest is other detail. I know that I was captivated by it all the way through and found the whole experience extremely pleasant. Unfortunately I did not see it as a child but I am told by some who did that their reaction was the same jaw dropping captivation as mine. I don't really look too deeply into why I liked it so much, I do not know enough about why something works, scene construction or camera angles or whatever I just know this works and I know I am not alone in liking this film. If you were looking for a description of a plot or synopsis in this review you will not find one here because there are numerous other reviewers who are infinitely more eloquent than me. For anybody watching this film for the first time please don't look for the goofs just enjoy it for what it is. It is a fantasy and one of the best if not the best ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Four Year Old Me's Obsession,"I think every kid has THAT MOVIE growing up. You know, the one you watched every day & had memorized. The Wizard of Oz was my movie. It was my life. This movie is one of those classics that could not be improved upon by modern film wizardry. If made today, the Cowardly Lion would most likely be CGI but he wouldn't have the personality Bert Lahr gave the character. One of the most depressing things that has happened to the filmmaking process, in my opinion, is how many movies are just people standing in front of a green screen with all the magic added later by computers. The fact that the land of Oz was made by real hands and that Dorothy actually walked down the yellow brick road, makes everything a little more special to me. http://amandalovesmovies.com/2012/02/29/the-wizard-of-oz/",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
the best movie that i have ever seen.,"OK.... who does not like the Wizrad of oz.... i mean... come on... that is probably one of the best movies that i have ever seen. in fact that is the best movie that i have ever seen. i am probably the only twelve year old girl that is almost obbsessed with that movie. well... there are other twelve yeard old girls that love that movie, so i guess i am one of the twelve year old girls that is almost obbsessed with the wizard of oz. i guess that comes to show you that no matter how old you are you can still love a movie that is almost 60 years older than you are. i think the thing that made the wizard of oz so successful is that back then movies were made in black and white. in this movie it was made in black and white plus color. i like the fact that when dorathy was in kansas the director made it black and white... but when she was in oz the director made it in color... if it was in all black and white i would have gotten really bored even though the plot of the story is amazing. plus the actors were absolutely amazing... i couldn't imagine any one else playing those parts. in credible movie and i think who ever hasn't seen it to go out and see it... it is an ingredible movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Journey Over the Rainbow: The Enduring Magic and Simple Truths of 'The Wizard of Oz',"In the pantheon of classic cinema, few films capture the imagination quite like ""The Wizard of Oz."" Its journey from sepia-toned Kansas to the Technicolor wonder of Oz is more than a mere shift in palette; it's a passage into a dreamscape, a land where the impossible not only becomes possible but lives and breathes with the vibrancy of a thousand rainbows.The film's opening, a portrait of life on a Kansas farm, is deceptively simple. Yet, even in these early scenes, there's a sense of yearning, a whisper of the extraordinary in the mundane. Judy Garland's Dorothy is the embodiment of innocent wonder, her voice a clarion call that resonates with the desires of every heart that ever dared to dream. ""Over the Rainbow"" is not just a song; it's an anthem of hope.As Dorothy is whisked away to Oz by a tumultuous tornado, the film achieves a cinematic metamorphosis. The transition to color is a masterstroke, symbolizing the awakening of desire and the beginning of adventure. In Oz, Dorothy encounters characters who are as endearing as they are symbolic - the Scarecrow's quest for intellect, the Tin Man's longing for heart, and the Lion's pursuit of courage. They are fragments of humanity, seeking what they believe they lack, not realizing that their journey together is the true path to self-discovery.The visual splendor of Oz is unmatched, a testament to the artistry of the filmmakers. The Emerald City gleams with a luster that rivals the stars, the Yellow Brick Road winds into the horizon like a promise, and the Wicked Witch's castle looms with an ominous beauty. The film's use of practical effects, from the twister to the flying monkeys, imbues it with a tactile authenticity that modern CGI can seldom replicate.Yet, it is not just the visual that makes ""The Wizard of Oz"" a masterpiece. The narrative is a tightly woven tapestry, each thread a lesson, each color a feeling. The songs are not mere interludes; they are integral to the storytelling, advancing the plot and deepening our connection to the characters. ""We're Off to See the Wizard"" is as much a call to adventure as it is a bonding moment for our heroes.The pacing, while generally brisk, does falter at times, particularly in the second act as the group ventures through the Haunted Forest. The menace of the Wicked Witch, while iconic, can feel one-dimensional compared to the more nuanced portrayals of villainy we've come to appreciate in modern cinema.The film's resolution, hinging on the power of the ruby slippers and the revelation that ""there's no place like home,"" while emotionally satisfying, might strike the more cynical viewer as overly simplistic. The deus ex machina of Glinda's late-game revelation about the slippers' power could be seen as a narrative shortcut, albeit one that serves the film's fairy-tale logic.""The Wizard of Oz"" remains a cultural touchstone, a film that transcends its era to speak to the eternal child in all of us. It reminds us that courage, love, and wisdom are not qualities we lack but ones we fail to recognize in ourselves. And perhaps most importantly, it teaches us that the journey is not just about finding what we seek but discovering that we already possess it.As the credits roll and we leave the land of Oz, we carry with us the echoes of its magic, the lessons of its characters, and the warmth of its spirit. ""The Wizard of Oz"" is not just a film; it's a piece of cinematic history, a slice of collective memory, and a beacon of the power of storytelling. It's a reminder that, sometimes, the simplest stories are the ones that resonate the deepest, and the truest magic is found not in the far-off lands of our dreams but in the heart of our own home.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Wizard of Oz review,This musical/film was and still is iconic. I have watched it so many times within the past few years and it is a musical that I can rewatch consistently.

The value of Oz is a no-brainer,"Some of the criteria here that people use to rip this movie are a hoot. i.e. ""It's not realistic."" (! well... it IS a child's fantasy) ""They changed the book"" is an argument rooted in the deeply absurd idea that movies are best when they strictly adhere to decisions made for the benefit of a completely different media. Come to think of it the book didn't have songs in it... Admittedly the films weird cult (as in Christianity) creates the biggest barrier to getting anything from the object of devotion.While the decision to write off the land of Oz as a dream is a creative writing teachers nightmare, it probably saved the culture from fifty years of garbage sequels that would have sullied this film. That the book was ""changed"" is a strange complaint, because the larger point of contention is that they only filmed 3/4ths of it. The last portion of the book is completely missing. (the quadlings, the dainty china country, green glasses) The exclusion of these bits without their being missed, is indicative of how arbitrary Baums inclusions are.Most of the altered elements are technically motivated. How do you have a swarm of field mice carry a lion out a poppy field in 1939? The slippers were changed to the more vibrant red color because the original silver slippers offered nothing that couldn't have been shown in the black and white world Dorothy has left. etc.As it is, it offers an abundance for a child to digest and the inclusion of the missing elements would have compressed the rest and perhaps triggered exhaustion in the audience. My patience grows thin at the ""If I were King"" interlude and the movie mercifully omits the late developments. Any book would do well to have such a hack job done on it. Baums simplistic, chirpy books might be out of print by now if not for this movie. Furthermore Baum restlessly throws away populations and characters over the course of each book before they're even developed. There's a spoof of Baum's books just waiting to be written, called ""The United Nations of Oz,"" in which Oz diplomacy is explained to suggest how all these nations, regions & peoples get along... it might be useful in our world.You could complain about what it doesn't achieve but the movie is so packed with iconographic elements (the yellow brick road, munchkins, witches, malevolent trees) all entering the tableaux in breathless maximization (the way children prefer their stimulation) that the movie becomes powerfully vivid. The window has probably closed on the era in which you could intentionally produce a movie that plays as this does on the naivete and complexity of the American psyche.My only complaint about this is that it is perfectly scaled to the venue which popularized it (TV). On the big screen the tiresome use of vaudeville shtick & cop-outs cheapens and trivializes plot points and grates on a viewer.Next time you watch it, try cataloging which gender holds all the power in the movie. Margaret Hamilton terrifies kids, and her witch is iconographic. Can anyone show me a green witch before 1939? Some goofy lines are hysterically inappropriate seventy years later (only bad witches are ugly... toto too!) There's a moment as the Munchkins entreat her to ""Follow the Yellow Brick Road"" where Dorothy's rhythmic walk transforms into her happy dance-skip. It's a wonderful moment that for it's triviality shouldn't be as joyful and touching as it is. Dorothy's unacknowledged kiss from Glinda is also sweet.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A timeless classic!,"As a kid, The Wizard of Oz (1939) was always one of my favorite movies to watch. This is a movie that me and my family would constantly watch whenever it aired on TNT or TBS. There are even stories wherever my family would pretend to act like they never watch this movie just so they could watch it again. Regardless of that, I decided to watch this movie for this review and I can tell you that this is still one of the best movies of all time.Positives for The Wizard of Oz (1939):
The main thing that makes this movie a timeless classic is the story. This is one of those stories that will instantly resonate with a lot of people and it will continue to do so for years to come. The other thing that this movie has going for it is the cast of characters from Dorothy, Toto, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion. These are characters who have a lot of the same desires and worries that a lot of us want and need in our lives and it is easy for the audience to identify with these characters more. Then, you have the Wicked Witch of the West who is easily one of the best villains in the history of cinema as she is so conniving and wicked (pun intended) that it makes it easy for the audience to hate her as well as her eventual defeat even more satisfying. Then, you have all of the side characters populating the movie from the munchkins to the flying monkeys and they add another level of joy and wonder to the viewing experience. The movie's production and costume design is fantastic from start to finish. The special effects for time are fantastic and they all still hold on to this day. And of course, you have the musical numbers that are among some of the best to ever be put on-screen. And finally, I love how the movie shows the audience that the things they want and need in life were always there for us and that we just have to look deeper to find those things.Overall, The Wizard of Oz (1939) is an all-time instant classic for the ages and it is one of my favorite movies of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I failed,"I feel I have failed ""Oz"". Like everyone else, I saw i when I was a kid, probably more than once, and I feel that parts of the movie became one with my imagination. I remember actually believing in the locations as places that could exist somewhere, and probably did.Watching it now, though, for the first time in over twenty-five years, I was a bit let down. It was impossible to believe in it as I had back then, which is not a problem I have had with other fantasy and sci fi pictures. With them, I can still suspend disbelief. With ""The Wizard of Oz"", though, I felt like I was watching a play. Some of its effects are still impressive, like the first ""appearance"" of the Wizard. But the sets and environments just seem too fake now.Also, I felt like there were too many songs. There's a reason why people only remember one or two songs from the movie, no matter how many times they've seen it. I'll admit it, though: I'm not a musical fan. I find it unpleasantly fake and tiresome when characters break into song.I am not one to review ""Wizard of Oz"", but do so anyway, because I review every movie I watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Book is Better,"I didn't like this movie much before I read the book; I really didn't like it after. L. Frank Baum's book is a masterpiece and Glinda is a badass.

There's no place like home,"Fantasy movies of today are generally escapist extravaganzas of uncompromising pace. They show everything for real what kids once didn't even dream of imagining - they are graphic, loud and if there's a morality lesson to be learned from it at all it's sugar-coated beyond recognition. The musical classic ""The Wizard of Oz"" is different. Starting off on a farm in Kansas, a plain kind of reality shot in black and white awaits. A genuine surprise move for its time the film then dives into the Technicolor fantasy world of Dorothy's dream, only to eventually emerge back where we set out - in the reality of life, unchanged in color, but full with experiences gained from the journey enriching what once seemed drab and plain. Thus the ""Wizard of Oz"" is a coming of age movie that deals with anxieties and how to overcome them - with a bit of brain, heart and courage things are half as frightening as they seem, and we are reassured that even wizards are just plain human.""The Wizard of Oz"" based on the timeless children book classic by L. Frank Baum however is much more than a film only children would enjoy - it's a treat for all ages. The action and the music are heart-lifting, the film is funny, entertaining, fascinating, the tale's metaphors are deep enough to appeal to everyone and it still holds up many years after its release back in 1939. Take for instance Roy Bolger's famous scarecrow dance, Judy Garland singing ""Somewhere over the rainbow"" and the final scenes with trusted faces and the realization that there's no place like home, despite all the problems and troubles. Well, sometimes it helps to take the shortcut through fantasy land to get to the real thing. Here's one way.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A superb classic!,"Who would ever think of a fantasy that would leave an impression that would last for a lifetime? Well, Victor Fleming made ""The Wizard of Oz"" with a cast that would make a successful movie happen. Judy Garland as the ever impressionable Dorothy Gale really makes it sparkle with her sly wit and sultry voice. And that footwork with those ruby slippers, very graceful. Ray Bolger, another great dancer. Looks great as the goofy Hunk, and his role as The Scarecrow. Man that takes a lot of talent I really like that. Jack Haley, really good play both Hickory and The Tin Woodsman he had a lot of guts to help the others in distress despite having no heart. Bert Lahr as Zeke and The Cowardly Lion now that's a riot! ""Put 'em Up!"" Put 'Em Up!"" Why he's supposed to be the ""King of the Jungle"" now he's The ""Chicken of the Jungle"". Pure encouragement is what each one needed. The bronze screen beginning is really cool, who needed that black & white format? And the character that really made my blood boil is that dirty old Miss Gulch(Margaret Hamliton). She was bad to the county, and Dorothy was right, she is nothing but a mean old witch! Especially when Dorothy was in that tornado and saw everyone she knew. She killed the Wicked Witch of the East with the house, the Munchkins thank her. She used water on The one of the West, the guards thanked her. I guess Oz owed her a debt of gratitude, I guess she is welcomed to Oz at anytime! This movie is a surefire classic, and it is great for the whole family. Which in fact it really is! Rating 5 stars!

Over-rated,"Dorothy (Judy Garland) runs away with her dog, Toto, but a tornado forces her back home and blows everything upside down. When it has passed and she opens her front door, she and Toto have been transported to the Land of Oz. So begins a journey to return home on which she makes friends and has an enemy in the Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton). Does Dorothy make it back......?The film starts and ends in black and white while the main section of the film, ie, the story that occurs in the ""Land of Oz"", is told in colour. It's a good effect and it's also a nice story in that the characters that Dorothy comes across in Oz relate to people that she already knows. The Wicked Witch of the West is scary and Dorothy's red shoes have a great sparkle value.However, I found that many of the characters creeped me out, eg, the Munchkins - dressed-up midgets in garish outfits that sing and dance (slightly gross idea), - flying monkeys who serve the Wicked Witch (equally grotesque), - and the ""Tin Man"", a psychological oddity (like those people who paint themselves silver and stand motionless on plinths in city centres, occasionally making a sudden movement and scaring children.) The songs are generally rubbish - in fact, the only good song is ""We're Off To See The Wizard"". I can understand why gay people like this film, but I think it's over-rated and it ends with a slice of ghastly sentimentalism.The best line comes courtesy of the Wizard: ""Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain!"" - very funny.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Judy Garland embodies the American Dream,"I don't think there's any kid who lives their entire childhood without watching The Wizard of Oz and creating a soft, cozy spot in their heart for the film to stay the rest of their life. As a kid, it's pretty much impossible to dislike. Sure, there are a few kids out there who get scared by the Margaret Hamilton, but it's still a wonderful, magical, safe place to spend ninety minutes.So, since everyone in the world has seen this movie, there's no point in my describing the plot and giving reasons why you should rent it. Most of you probably own a copy; we recently exchanged our very used VHS copy for an anniversary DVD. We also have a behind-the-scenes book about the making of the movie!When my brother and I grew up watching it, we believed when the film transitioned from black-and-white to color, that was the first time Hollywood discovered Technicolor. It was such incredible technology, we assumed Hollywood wanted to ease audiences into their new world by showing them colored film only when Judy Garland awakened in a fantasy world. To this day, no matter what anyone tells us-and despite the fact that I was instructed differently during my years at film school-we still credit The Wizard of Oz as the first movie made in color.To me, what makes a movie a classic is the ability to get more out of it each time you watch it. Every time I watch The Wizard of Oz, I see it from a slightly different perspective. Maybe I'll be able to fully appreciate Frank Morgan's layered performance, or maybe I'll see the story as symbolic instead of literal. Gone with the Wind won the Academy Award for 1939's Best Picture, but although it was a grand epic and an enormous amount of work went into it, we've given the Best Picture Rag to The Wizard of Oz. It stands the test of time better. It's much more of a classic, in how I define the word.The Wizard of Oz is a true staple of Americana, a film that reaches the hearts of all Americans in a way it culturally might not be able to reach others. Americans have it in their blood to be pioneers, explorers, conquerors, and to seek outside themselves in order to feel ""whole"". If you don't understand this, you're probably not American or need to brush up on your history lessons. In this 1939 classic, Judy Garland lives the American Dream. She's misunderstood at home and feels unsafe, so when she sings the iconic ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" in her famously warbly voice, it signals to the audience that she's going to try to find an outside source to make her happy. It's the timeless theme of wanting to grow up quickly and then wishing to relive your childhood, all told in the magical Technicolor fantasy. Any adult who's ever tried to survive on their own, forge a new path different than their family, and prove that this time, when they go out into the world, things will be different, probably cries at the end of the movie. The lesson that no one seems to learn is taught in a very lovely, heartwarming way in The Wizard of Oz: it's impossible to find happiness by going outside yourself. You have to find happiness in your own heart, at home, first.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The most over-rated film of all time,"I cannot understand people's infatuation with this film. Come on people, The Wiz is better than this, and that had Michael Jacksn in it. Michael Jackson, people!What's my problem with this? How everybody talks about it like it's the best movie on the planet. I watched it, I wasn't impressed. The lines were delivered alright, but just overall, I wasn't impressed. Sure, back in it's time, it might have been revolutionary . . . but I preferred Predator over this when I first saw Wiz of Oz back in 1995.

"""There's a land that I've heard of...""","Forget about polls and box office records. In real terms The Wizard of Oz is almost certainly the most beloved motion picture of all time. It glitters among the brightest jewels of the most effective movie-making factory in cinema history, in the industry's undisputed golden age.Oz is of course a timeless masterpiece, enjoyed by every new generation that discovers it. However, much of its secret is in how much a product of classic-era Hollywood it is. Rather than simply turn the book into images, the writers and producers' aim was to meld the story around the best elements from contemporary movie lore. The dialogue, and in particular Yip Harburg's lyrics, are full of the wisecracks and wordplay of 1930s comedy. Herbert Stothart's arrangements of Harold Arlen's sublime melodies have the same playful harmonic style that he used for the popular Jeanette MacDonald musicals. Even the art design references the fashions of the day – the Emerald City looks like nothing less than an art deco hotel! And of course the ingenious decision to shoot Kansas in sepia and Oz in Technicolor expresses the wonder of that vibrant and at the time relatively novel process.But really the most Tinseltown thing about Wizard of Oz is its cast. People like Frank Morgan, Billie Burke, Ray Bolger and Bert Lahr aren't acting in the sense of submerging themselves and trying to become the characters they play. They are doing the reverse; playing the characters in the style of their own persona. Whatever role he appeared in, Frank Morgan always played the part of a lovable charlatan, fumbling his words and bluffing his way through. Billie Burke was perennially fussy and mumsy, and was only ever a wand away from being a fairy godmother. Bolger, Lahr and Jack Haley did not have quite the high-profile screen personas of Morgan and Burke, but they were nevertheless the kind of comedy-novelty players upon which the Hollywood musical thrived.And the directors were not of the arty, individualist ""auteurs"" that mainstream film theory has reserved for posterity. King Vidor (who directed the Kansas scenes) and Victor Fleming (who directed almost everything else) were professional studio employees. Nevertheless each had their particular strengths they brought to a project, and, even though it is coincidence that the switch was made when it was, each is ideally suited to the material they are responsible for. Vidor was very much the romanticist of the outdoors, and his measured pace and beautiful shot composition give the right note of sentimentality to the place Dorothy calls home. Vidor's delicate camera-work for ""Over the Rainbow"" adds to the enchantment of the number. He keeps Judy Garland at the centre of the screen, but gently pans and tilts to bring the horizon and then the sky around to frame her, keeping the image moving in time with the music. Fleming on the other hand was a man of action, and he gives a punch and dynamic rhythm to the vivid fantasy world.The Wizard of Oz may be fashioned in the Hollywood style, but studio production was more than just a collection of gimmicks and trimmings. They really knew how to tell stories. The movie adaptation transforms a cute fairy tale into an epic fable about wanderlust, homesickness and finding one's true self. Its appeal is universal and timeless because it speaks so sincerely to its audience. And to do so with such wit and beauty is really what cinema is all about.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Best Musical Fantasy Ever,"Generation after generation, this downright bizarre little movie continues to fascinate viewers with its imaginative and surrealistic sets and score. It has created a cottage industry around a little girl from Kansas who ends up over the rainbow, only to find that life in a dream is as often a nightmare. What is so durable about the film is the way the elements all work together to tell a story that is enthralling no matter how many times you see it. ""The Wizard of Oz"" is the quintessential musical. Seeing it at just the right age somehow seems to make it watchable repeatedly at any age. The music is fully integrated into the story line. Everybody sings-except, of course for the Wicked Witch of the West and her flying monkeys. Evil beings don't sing. In addition to ""Over the Rainbow,"" consider how memorable are ""We're Off to See the Wizard"" and ""If I Only Had a Brain."" Much has been written about this film, and it even spawned a Broadway play, ""Wicked,"" and a reworked version as ""The Wiz"" starring Diana Ross, but there is simply no equaling this. And look at the casting: Judy Garland seems too old to play Dorothy-until you think that a girl going through puberty on a prairie farm, with no parents and no playmates but ""three shiftless farmhands"" might be the perfect candidate for Oz. Margaret Hamilton as the wicked witch has defined witchiness forever, and Billie Burke's irritatingly sweet voice convinces you that she really is a witch when she tells Dorothy that she knew all along how to send her home. Ray Bolger's dance sequences as the scarecrow are phenomenal. Jack Haley Jr. as the tin man is suitably sappy, and Bert Lahr couldn't pull off the cowardly lion any better than he did. (And those costumes must have been miserable to work in.) Lastly, the venerable actor Frank Morgan is perfect in his blustery role as the wizard and his various guises. BTW, if you wonder what the wicked witch's minions are singing in the ""Winkie Song"" as they march around with their spears, it's nothing more than ""O-Ee-Yah! Eoh-Ah!""

"""I'll get you my little pretty, and your dog too.""","There are only two other Movies from Hollywood's Golden Age that have been as influential, deconstructed, analyzed, reconsidered, penetrating, viewed, and reviewed, noticed, and unforgotten as this one. King Kong (1933) and Citizen Kane (1941).Everyone who has seen Oz has an opinion and it is usually a strong one. It undeniably unmasks facades and oozes into the deeper parts of the consciousness worthy of the best Psychoanalysis.On the surface it lures one in with its sentimentality and charms with its catchy and heartfelt tunes. It bombards the senses, like a psychedelic, expanding consciousness through dripping Colors and the most imaginative of imagery.As the mind opens it is vulnerable to scary images as well as the sublime. Reality becomes a focused blur that is experienced profoundly and deeply. It is Art at its most cunningly persuasive.If you ""pay no attention to the Man behind the curtain"", you will find yourself in a land of Milk and Honey, but if you acknowledge reality for what it is and not what is hoped for, it might become a Truth that is as scary as a Flying Monkey.This Film is a Wonderful way to open the ""doors of perception"".

"""Follow the Yellow Brick Road""","This by far is my favorite movie of all time. I have never seen anything that would ever surpass it. How wonderful every aspect of this movie is. From the lighting to the costumes to the scenes. Victor Flemming out did himself on this film in so many ways. Even though he made his mark directing films all the way from 1919-1956 this by far I believe to be the best film he had ever directed. (Gone with the wind, Joan of Arc, and Dr. Jekyl & Mr. Hyde are other classics of his- but in my opinion they are not in the same boat as this film!) From the moment the film started you were caught up with Dorthy Gale (Judy Garland) and cant take your eyes off her. So beautiful and innocent. For this film only being 101 minutes long it seems much longer because it was so detailed and vibrant. Even today if you watch the movie you still get caught up in it and end up loving it no matter who you are or what age. I also believed Margaret Hamilton (The Wicked Witch of the West) did such an amazing job. I watched this movie for probably the 100th time in my life and her character still shakes me up a little bit. I loved how the movie went from sepia tone and when the gates of oz opened up then it went into Technicolor. I thought that was such an amazing effect, especially for its time. The lighting and scenes in this movie are totally MGM (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer) quality. Each scene, costume, lighting, character, is out of this world cool and back then so expensive. Bright lighting throughout the film showed how much money time and effort Fleming put into this film. Timeless classic, must see, life isn't complete without seeing it. Lions, and tigers, and bears- OH MY! I've got you my pretty! And your little dog too! Follow the Yellow Brick Road---- And who could forget--- the munchkins!!!

For the first time, I noticed Auntie Em mentioned that Miss Gulch owns much of the county. I guess that is there to give us a reason to hate her actions even more.One thing that always bothered me was that the dog DID bite her & she went through the procedure of getting an order from the local sheriff to take Toto away. It isn't much, but they included language to bolster the family's resistance to removing the dog.Since this was the Great Depression I guess that is enough to help viewers decide where their loyalties should be. Imagine a rich spinster putting her needs ahead of a working class family.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Follow the yellow brick road,"The Wizard of Oz is often considered by many ones of the most famous movies in film history. Based on the children's book ""The wonderful wizard of Oz"" by L. Frank Baum. It tells the simple story of a young girl named Dorothy( Judy Garland) who when a tornado come through on her family farm in Kansas wake's alone with her dog Toto in the world of Oz a strange and colorful world where she soon finds herself on a journey to meet the Wizard of OZ who can help here get back home. Along the way encounters an assortment of friends from the scarecrow, The Tin man, and The Cowardly Lion. All while dealing with an evil Wicked Witch. A very simple plot yet despite that thing this it still makes for a very appealing family film The cast is a very colorful Buch. Judy Garland for her time was a very beautiful and innocent-looking actress. In many ways, it shows through Dorothy's character as a whole. She's not satisfied with her life at home and dreams of a place of her own choice. In many ways similar to Alice from Alice in Wonderland She witnesses these things, but pretty much accepting of what's going on pretty quick. The rest of the cast like a scarecrow who is so energetic and optimistic they all give good performances. The Wicked Witch what's there to be said about her? Isn't much to describe the original depiction of a Witch the big nose, point hat, and flying broomstick. The cackling it's an iconic character who is just evil for the sake of being evil and that is okay. The music is good though some of the songs can be rather selective. While I've never really cared for the Munchkins. I found them more annoying than lovable and fun. Over the Rainbow and off to see the Wizard are classics. The film also has a legacy for its visuals. Being one of the first feature-length films to use technicolor It does bring a lot of the scenery to life. When you go from the sepia tone to Dorothy opening the door for the first time. It's like when you see Willy Wonka's candy room for the first time. You do feel like you entered a different world. Along with the background Mat-paintings. The Shot of the emerald city alone is a piece of art. Even the costumes for Scarecrow, tin, and Lion are pretty good for 1939. So yeah it simple film by today's standards, but the Whimsicality charm, and artistic tone for the time is still a classic for all ages.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"A ""Wonderful Wiz"", Indeed","After reading the novel ""Wicked"" (which I was thoroughly bored/disappointed with) and then picking up the book ""The Making of Oz"" (which I enjoyed immensely), the natural progression led me to sit down and watch the original ""Wizard of Oz"" film for the first time in 10 years or so. As people have likely been saying for 70 years now, I was transformed into a small child once again, inwardly dreading the exact second the Wicked Witch first comes on the screen in a big puff of smoke and singing along to each and every song/dance number.Everyone knows the story...Dorothy Gale from Kansas ""travels"" to the magical city of Oz, where she meets such characters as the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion, while trying all the while just to get home. During her travels, she is tormented by the Wicked Witch of the East, as well as entering into a love/hate relationship with the Wizard himself.What really strikes me, though, is how well this film has held up over time. With the possible exceptions of Casablanca and Gone With the Wind (and I believe an even stronger case for ""Oz"" can be made than either of those two), this film has charmed the hearts and minds of both children and adults alike for an incredibly long time. Just think of all the children's movies (e.g. Disney, Pixar, High School Musical) and television programs (e.g. Cartoons, Nickelodeon, Disney Channel) that have came and went over the years, yet children (like the younger sister I recently watched the film with) still watch with wonder as Dorothy opens that door into the wonderful world of Oz.Thus, there really isn't anything bad that can be said about The Wizard of Oz. It is the consummate children's film, filled with incredible color, silly acting, and plenty of singing and dancing, while it still holds its appeal to all but the most crotchety of older folks, as the filmmaking was so well-constructed that it stands the test of time.It is a long-held tradition that the film is shown once a year on network television, and I would recommend adhering to that ""regime"", even if you go the DVD route. Trust me, it will never get old.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Highly entertaining, but also... enlightening","A tornado rips through Dorothy's home in Kansas and transports her to the land of Oz where she meets a scarecrow in need of a brain, a tin man in need of a heart and a lion in need of courage. So they venture to the Emerald City in search of the eponymous wizard.""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939) is eminently entertaining for both kids and adults. The message is great to boot. Yes, it's about developing your head, heart, and courage to find your way ""home,"" but its most potent moral is about pulling back the curtain on political authorities and religion to expose the feeble phony pulling the levers.Which isn't to say that all such authorities are phonies, of course, just that we need to be ever conscious of the fakes trying to manipulate us by pulling our strings.The creators were smart to actually make the wicked witch of the west, her castle and flying monkeys creepy and horrific (in a comic booky way).The film runs 1 hour, 42 minutes.GRADE: A+",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Wizard of Oz... a movie for the ages,"I saw The Wizard of Oz countless times when I was a kid. It now amazes me how a movie made in 1939 could be a kid's favorite in the 80's and now a favorite of my own kids' here in the 21st century. Even more amazing is that I normally can't stand musicals, but I loved the music in The Wizard of Oz. They seamlessly and fittingly entered into each song. There wasn't a single song about which I said, ""That was awful,"" or ""Where did that song come from?""The story was pure genius. The Wizard of Oz was one of the most creative and brilliantly done movies of all time. You can always gauge the success of a movie by how it impacts society in general and the film industry in particular. There were plays made after this movie and there were many scenes mimicked or lines often quoted in the years succeeding it. There are numerous lines from ""The Wizard of Oz"" that, if quoted, just about everyone would know them.Every role and every character was vital to the movie. There were no wasted characters or wasted scenes even. Each actor did a magnificent job. The acting was superb.

"""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz""","The Wizard of Oz is a mesmerizing tale that takes viewers to an enchanted land beyond their wildest imaginations. It's a land filled with bright colors, memorable music, and a wicked old witch, played by Margaret Hamilton. Dorothy Gale, played by the incomparable Judy Garland, gets whisked away from her farm in Kansas to a magical land called Oz. After learning that her house killed the Wicked Witch of the East, a group of jolly munchkins points her in the direction of the Emerald City along the yellow brick road. While she and her dog Toto are traveling this road, she meets and befriends a witless scarecrow (Ray Bolger), a rusty tin man (Jack Haley), and a cowardly lion (Burt Lahr). The four friends then embark on a journey to see ""the wonderful Wizard of Oz (Frank Morgan)"" in the Emerald City. This is a perfect movie for children of all ages and their families to enjoy. But beware, some scenes might be a little scary for younger children, such as the ones with the Wicked Witch of the West. However, the movie incorporates many funny and enjoyable scenes. The combination of these different scenes makes the movie especially entertaining. Writers Noel Langley, Florence Ryerson, Edgar Allan Woolf, did a spectacular job adapting the movie from the book. The acting is superb by each and every one of the characters. You can tell that the actors and actresses became one with their characters, making it really believable for the audience. Adrian Adolph Greenberg did a wonderful job with the costumes. The makeup was also very well done, giving the impression that characters such as the Scarecrow, were real people. The costumes and makeup were imaginative, adding to the overall magic of the movie. The setting and props did an excellent job of making Oz seem like a real place. The special effects helped add even more to the realism of Oz. My absolute favorite thing about the movie was the marvelous singing and dancing. The music is catchy, and makes you feel like you want to sing along. The dancing goes especially well with the songs and was amusing to watch. All in all, The Wizard of Oz is unforgettable story, sure to be a hit for years to come. It's a movie you can watch over and over again and it never loses its magic. I know I'm definitely going to add it to my list of favorite movies. So be sure to watch it with your family and friends, I can promise you that you won't regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

What's not to like?,"""The Wizard of Oz"" is without question one of the best films Hollywood ever cranked out. This was one of two films that inspired me to be a filmmaker (the other was the original ""Star Wars""). ""The Wizard of Oz"" was one of the first movies I ever saw, and even to this day it's one of my favorites.It's a great example of something that's called escapist entertainment, which means that it sort of ""sweeps"" you away from the cold, ugly world that we inhabit and into the world of the characters. Even in 1939, with America recovering from a harsh economic depression and with World War II escalating, it was definitely an escape.I think today's movies can and should be more escapist (and artistic) than they are. Now it's mostly about how much cash all the studios rack in per film, which, to me, is a drag. Most of the films I saw back then were REAL investments. They had lots of really nice stuff.I really love the shot when the film turns from sepiatone to Technicolor (when Dorothy opened the door in her house beaten and shaken up by a twister in Kansas and saw a gorgeous, full-color place called Munchkinland). That was a breathtaking shot.Someone else on IMDb said this about the original Star Wars by the way: ""A kid's fantasy. An adult's memory."" The same thing goes for this one as well.

It is supportive to this feature being one of the exceptions.I start to wonder if I should be a Judy Garland fan. The background notes for Oz put me off, but this swings things around.*April 2008, I try a search for affordable early Garland and the little that was there was rather high priced by my standards.

The Wizard of Oz puts a glorious technicolor spell on younger audiences.,"Let's get this out of the way first. I had never seen The Wizard of Oz until now. Obviously its legendary status had allowed certain scenes and songs to enter the American pop culture stream, but yes I had never seen the entire film. So, here I am, bravely going to attempt to convey my overall disappointment with this revolutionary classic. Stay with me though, as it's not as bad as the Wicked Witch of the West. A tornado rips through a Kansas farm to which a young Dorothy is knocked out and transported to the magical world of Oz. She must follow the yellow brick road, with her new pantomime pals and loveable dog, to meet the wizard of Oz and find a way home.To say that this fantasy musical was revolutionary is an understatement. It is quite possibly the most influential, important and irresistibly fantastical feature to ever grace our screens. Despite the troubled production, Fleming pulls everything together to create a technical masterclass in film-making. The production design is out of this world. From the thick foliage enveloping the yellow brick road to the colossal spires of Emerald City. Every aspect looked gorgeous and will transport any viewer to its vivid fantasy world. Of course it goes without saying that the use of technicolor was extraordinary, paving the way for the future of cinema. Starting Dorothy's lofty adventure in Kansas with a maroon tint, only to then inject every colour of the rainbow when transported to Oz. I can only imagine how revolutionary that was back in 1939, and that's without mentioning the finely aged visual effects. The costumes, particularly the Scarecrow and the Wicked Witch of the West, enhanced the magical world they resided in. Rarely did they look cheap, giving much personality to the characters. The musical numbers, although simplistic due to mostly comprising of lyrics that are frequently repeated, were certainly memorable. ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow"" being one of the greatest musical songs to have ever been conceived.The film started off so well! My eyes were hypnotised, with Garland's commanding central performance (and beautiful singing voice) taking control. And then it dawned on me. I was rapidly becoming exhausted. Fleming couldn't maintain a suitable pace and unfortunately lost so much steam that it became stiffer than the Tin Man. The story was far too simplistic, conceding to repetition as Dorothy one-by-one meets a new individual whilst on her quest. Not enough happened in the plot to keep me entertained and I found myself succumbing to boredom on many occasions. The third act nearly picks up the pace, but builds up a formidable confrontation that ultimately felt underwhelming. Ironically melting into a multi-coloured puddle. Some of the editing felt messy, especially a scene where the Scarecrow talks but does not show him audibly moving his mouth. A few of the illusory tricks were incredibly noticeable, such as the Wicked Witch being lowered by a platform pretending to teleport thorough red smoke, which could've been concealed more efficiently.The whimsical themes and warm message of its story will resonate with younger audiences. The legendary acclaim that this film has garnered has been passed down generations, with many watching this as a child. Had I watched this when I was younger, I may have had a different viewpoint. Alas, watching this for the first time in my mid-20s has highlighted the noticeable weaknesses that unfortunately let the film down.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Still the only good Wizard of Oz movie in my opinion.,"In my opinion, this one is good and all the others are terrible....END OF STORY!! Out of all I've seen, this is the only one with both good acting and following the story well. The others that I've seen are either like sequels or something or they just add in a bunch of random garbage. As the first movie to have color, this movie was amazing when it came out and it's still pretty good today. Although color is normal today, it's interesting to see what people thought was incredible in 1939. According to IMDb, several Wizard of Oz movies are scheduled. I think that they need to stop them just as much if not more than they need to stop Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. In short, this movie is worth seeing at least once.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Eternal Wizard of Oz,"Expiring date on a movie, would not think so. I have not prior to this watched any other movies released in the 40s, but I can without a doubt say that the movie has become a milestone of practical sets, visual storytelling and child movies for its time. This is the sole reason why we today se 4K UHD re-releases of movies like this instead of the story carrying Rashômon or any other movie.In my opinion the movie has so much potential that eventually gets missed. The far too many unnecessary ""comedic"" scenes with the lion reduces screen time for other more vibrant characters and for the movie to evolve. A good example of this is the tin man who almost gets no lines or conversations through out the movie, we want to know more and get to know the interesting origin and in depth characterization of these characters. I am not saying that older people can't enjoy the movie but the underlaying message through out the movie is for a child audience.The key point to a movie like this is to attract a wide audience, why not use some more visuals and maybe skip some unnecessary dialogue scenes. Having the Antagonist maybe switch side and fall in love with the tin foil man. This would be a ""fun"" plot point and a perfect opportunity to fulfill the story arcs of our main characters on the adventure to the castle. Instead we get them fulfilling their arcs getting useless stuff from a garbage bag. Why not make so that the gate keeper actually was Oz all along to introduce a small plot twist?The possibilities are endless but the main thought of the movie still stays as effective in the 40s as it does today, keeping the kids entertained.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A classic!,"""The Wizard of Oz"" is great!!  My favorite thing about it is the color change from Kansas to Oz.  I also love the Scarecrow and the Tinman.

A timeless piece of art,"The first ever movie with color is still great 83 years later, the way it switches colors from it just being brown in the beginning to eventually being colored by the time they get to the land of oz, I thought was super clever, the acting is top tier, the setting is top tier, but the theories of glinda being the villians of the movie is what brings it down because there is so much evidence to back it up, the movie is funny when it tries to be funny, the movie isn't something you will forget immediately, neither is it a perfect movie, but it is one that will be loved and remembered for years to come.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Easily, one of the 10 top movie productions!!","Easily, in the 10 top movie productions!! One of the few films that the entire Family can enjoy. It didn't need any animation or the overkill of today's special effects to be totally entertaining. And yes, no one needed to spout out those 4 letter words that in todays world are somehow mandatory for good acting & film-making. And what a wonderful idea. Start the film in black & white. Then, when landing in OZ, they used a most effective technique of switching to color as the house door is opened for a first peak outside. Also, credit the gifted supporting actors, whose characters played so well against each others personalities and obvious shortcomings. The simple innocence of the Dorothy character bolstered by the incredible musical talents of Judy Garland made the film an all time classic. Many of the really great films were made during the 30's & 40's. And no, I didn't live during those times.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Classic fantasy/musical,"All-time classic family fantasy film with hundreds of midgets dancing to a Harburg/Arlen score and a smart story with an earthy moral -- there's no place like home (but who wouldn't want to visit a place like Oz?). Garland creates a classic characterization, sings with real emotion, and despite playing a bit too peppy, pulls it off in the end.   She's well-supported by a cast of vaudeville legends, including dancer Ray Bolger, comedian Bert Lahr, and Jack Haley and Frank Morgan.The photography is amazingly vivid, offset to good effect by the sepia-toned b & w sequences at the film's beginning and end.  Director Fleming once again shows he's one of the best in the world.A few notes on the film:  As many know, Buddy Ebsen was originally cast as the tin man (after having exchanged the part of the scarecrow with the more popular Bolger), and I think he would have made an excellent tin man. Jack Haley does a good job, but his style of comedy is very dry, and I think Ebsen had a better brand of physical comedy, plus he was a very good dancer (anyone who's seen him do his somewhat robotic shuffle can easily imagine him in the part).A lot of people have commented on the combination of rock band Pink Floyd's ""Dark Side of the Moon"" and ""The Wizard of Oz.""  After trying this several times (in order to do it for oneself, simply begin the CD at the moment the MGM lion roars for the third time), I have become convinced that Pink Floyd did in fact time some of the musical effects with the visuals of the movie. There are numerous instances of this that will be immediately noticeable, but I particularly like the ringing bells on the album which are timed along with Margaret Hamilton's appearance on a bicycle!For fans of midget movies -- and I'm a big fan myself -- this is one of the all-time delights.  There are hundreds of midgets, they get their own theme song, and are showcased in some of the film's most stupendous moments. Having met a few of these little people myself at conventions, I have to say that I doubt the veracity of stories concerning their ""riotous"" behavior at local hotels, but then everybody WAS a bit younger way back then, so you never know!A technical note on the DVD -- I thought the quality of the production was excellent, the colors were perfect -- I've had problems with other WB discs which look like second rate laserdisc transfers, but they really put some effort into ""The Wizard of Oz"" and it shows.... also features fabulous deleted dance scene with Ray Bolger.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A incredible visual display of human ingenuity,"One of the most iconic films I've seen this year. I have not seen this actually as a kid and only seen bits and pieces of it. Seeing it as an adult and with an eye for the form and content I think it is excellent. Immediately I notice the Technicolor and visuals are impeccable for the time. Judy Garland is amazing in this from her singing, dialogue acting I think she really made this film. It's such a unique story and for being almost 100 years old it is still fun to watch. It was made entirely by human ingenuity no computers involved. I think all the music was so well done. As an adult I found them catch, thoughtful and clever. Such great acting across the board. Lots of great themes and good morals to. The Mise en scene is also very impressive, such a collection of bright characters and outfits, sets overall a shining example of how filmmaking is a work of art.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Famous Film,"I finally watched ""The Wizard of Oz"" for the first time, though I knew most of it beforehand, as our school put on a play of it years ago (I was a stagehand fyi). So watching the film was a long time coming.The end almost made me feel a real emotional connection, but I stopped short of being really moved by it. Though ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" is an undeniably classic song which is moving. I thought that Dorothy should have sung this song again at the end just before she made it back home to bookend her fantasy experience as well as to feature that terrific song one more time.So, while this film is more geared toward youths, it is still an enjoyable watch for adults, even if the munchkin singing goes on a bit too long, etc. I also withheld points for the somewhat occultic nature of the story, though I don't mean to be a prude. But what's with Dorothy being drugged in a poppy field! And of course Judy Garland had real life drug issues, so I have mixed feelings overall but who can deny The Wizard of Oz's place in our culture. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Go Dorothy, Go!!!","The Wizard of Oz is probably the only film ever of which I think everybody should see it! Not one person on this planet has an acceptable excuse for skipping it if they have the change. Even after 65 whole years, the story and characters still look fresh and the breath-taking scenery still causes daydreaming. Dorothy's extraordinary journey in the Land of Oz is funny, touching, valuable and rhythmic! Even the overload of sentiment and moral doesn't bother me in this one. The story couldn't be more sappy or politically correct but I don't careit's a visual masterpiece for sure and the importance of this motion picture in the history of cinema is inescapably. The Wizard of Oz practically is a complete chapter of cinema-history itselfreferenced, spoofed and honored in numerous other titles. A must-see fairy-tale that'll escort you to an imaginative and colorful world where wondrous characters live, evil has to be fought and important life-lessons are educated. Preferably one to watch at very young age for the first timeyou'll never forget this movie! And now you're off  to see the Wizard!!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An undeniable classic,"A real American staple, one of the greatest movies that was made. It's actually a fairytale, and although I was familiar with the story I haven't ever watched it before. It is a real, actual fairytale, that because of the time period this was being made, has a more grounded significance as it has many themes pulled from the American reality. It actually can be very profound in moments but its silly, goofy fun is what people have been treasuring the most. A very demanding production and so many people to organise, I'm really in awe of what they've managed to create. ""The Wizard of Oz"" has a very colourful and unique cast and I think that's what helped it survive throughout the years. I really did marvel in the spectacle but it's its childish approach that made me lose interest at times. Still an undeniable classic.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Wasn't that magical to me.....,OK the reason I gave this film 3/10 is because its not as good as the original books. Personally I like Return to Oz a lot better than this film. I can't stand musicals personally and this is full of musicals. I have an 8 month old daughter and when she gets older I am going to introduce her to Return to Oz instead of this film. I think she would relate and like the 2nd one a lot better than this. Honestly if it was not for the musicals this movie would get an 8 or 9 easily! The actors/actresses are great in this film which make it the classic it is. I do enjoy the story of the film and the characters but it just isn't up to par with the sequel in terms of fantasy. The 2nd one is so much darker than this which makes it much different in terms of what I like to watch. If you have not seen this movie you have to watch it but go rent or buy both films. I am sure your kids would like Return to Oz better than this one.j.d. & the dark empire,3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Maybe the greatest fantasy film of all-time,"This has always been a favorite of mine from childhood through adulthood. A great fantasy film adapted from the famous L. Frank Baum stories with screenplay from noel Langley, Florence Ryerson and Edgar Allan Woolf and about a dozen others that contributed to dialog including tow of the film's stars Bert Lahr and Jack Haley. The film received six Academy Award nominations winning two for Herbert Sothart's musical score and original song for Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg. It lost the 1939 Best Picture and Best Art Direction Academy Awards to Gone With the Wind and Best Cinematography to Wuthering Heights but incredibly lost Best Effects yo The Rains Came. Director Victor Flemming had a good year in 1939 directing both Gone With the Wind and The Wizard of Oz, two films that endearingly live on for generations. Great cinematography here from Harold Rosson who had a 50 year cinematography career that began in the early silent films and ended with Howard Hawks El Dorado in 1966. Veteran film editor Blanche Sewall skillfully edited this piece but over the years so much of this film has been cut up for television that it wasn't until recently that it's been restored to near it's original form. A fantastic cast with Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr, Jack Haley, Billie Burke and Margaret Hamilton. Amazingly Burke who plays good witch Glinda was 54 years old at the time. Five years older than Frank Morgan and 17 years older than Margaret Hamilton. I would like to see a restored version of this as I have not yet had the opportunity to and I would also like to see this up on the big screen. This is true movie magic and I would give it a 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Perfect fantasy entertainment...,"1st watched 6/10/2007 - 10 out of 10(Dir-Victor Fleming): Perfect fantasy entertainment with singable songs and danceable tunes fit for the whole family. Prior to this viewing, I'm sure I saw the movie on television when I was younger during one of those annual viewings, but this is the first time I've seen it in it's entirety since taking on the challenge of reviewing movies and I must say this is the first time in a long time that I'm having a hard time finding any fault in a movie. It is fun from beginning to end even to a 42-year old, with excellent portrayals of all the well-loved characters from the L. Frank Baum novel. The closest thing to an issue I had was the cowardly lion's 2nd song about being the king, but even it had it's merits. The version I watched was at a special Turner Classics movie presentation with added sing-a-long titles that just added to the fun for the audience allowing them to participate. We all know the story, but I'll recap it here. It's about a girl Dorothy from Kansas(played by the immortal Judy Garland) having struggles at home being noticed(in black & white), then a tornado comes, she goes into a fantasy world(in color) where a lot of her family is portrayed behind the Oz characters. She eventually learns that there is no place like home after struggling to get back there thru many trials & tribulations mainly coming from the evil witch of the west. This is the basic story, but it is told with such inventiveness with excellent set pieces, songs, costumes and storytelling that keeps you interested to the very end(which changes to black & white). After watching this, I now understand why this movie & it's stars have been immortalized in filmdom for all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Easy Big Fella,"""The Wizard of Oz"" is a fantastic effort at making a movie. I have to wonder if it was possible to create a movie any better back in 1939. However, I am curious on the size of the budget allowed for production. The difference between todays big budget movies and those from sixty years ago, are today the scripts and plots are pathetic. This movie can be enjoyed by all ages, and perhaps led the way for musicals to be made into films.8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Perfecting Baum's vision,"A book I was once reading referred to Frank Baum's use of a dream as a narrative device--revealing the author's ignorance that Baum's novel depicted Oz as a real place, not a dream. The idea that it was a dream was an innovation of the 1939 movie. I'm always amazed at how many people haven't read the novel and make mistakes like that. It's one of the most popular and enduring stories of modern times, yet it's remembered mostly through the 1939 film.Ironically, Baum disliked the ""It was all a dream"" convention in literature. I agree with him. It's a convention that usually seems contrived. ""Wizard of Oz,"" however, is a a rare example of a film that makes it work. One of the movie's secrets, I believe, is that it keeps the idea in the background most of the time and doesn't dwell on it. Dorothy's Oz experience is far too coherent and stable to plausibly represent a dream. It isn't like ""Alice in Wonderland,"" a meditation on absurdity. Since it's adapted from a straightforward fantasy, the events are impossible but not absurd, magical but not nonsensical.That's why it works so well. Too many filmmakers today think they have to present dreams as, well, dreamlike, full of weird and disconnected imagery. That may be realistic, but it doesn't make for good storytelling. As a result, movies about dreams usually range from turkeys like the John Candy comedy ""Delirious"" to bizarre tours de force like Richard Linklater's ""Waking Life."" Few movies treat the subject in a nonchalant, offhand fashion, the way ""Wizard of Oz"" did.Granted, occasional scenes in the 1939 film do feel a little dreamlike. There is, for example, the ""lions, tigers, and bears"" sequence, where as soon as Dorothy thinks a frightening thought, it immediately happens. Then there's the scene where Dorothy can't remember why Scarecrow and Tin Man, both versions of workers from her Kansas farm, seem so familiar to her. Fortunately, however, the movie avoids anything strange or off-the-wall. We can take the story at face value even as our knowledge that it's a dream gives it an added psychological dimension.The Oz sequences are broadly faithful to the book, though they do not include some of Dorothy's later adventures. Partly as a result of this trimming, the movie feels less episodic and more focused, with a certain depth the book lacked. Glinda, a composite of two relatively minor characters from the book, has a godlike, deus ex machina quality here, and there's a sense that she is watching over Dorothy the whole time. By placing Dorothy's final confrontations with the Wicked Witch and the Wizard near the end of the story rather than the middle, the film draws greater attention to their significance.Most important, the movie creates a whole new storyline for the Kansas section. All these early scenes--Dorothy's feeling unloved by her caretakers, Dorothy's hanging out with the three farmhands, Dorothy's attempting to rescue her dog Toto from the ghastly Miss Gulch--were invented for the film. Yet they provide the setup for Dorothy's Oz experience, where she will meet versions of the people she knew in Kansas. This not only fleshes Dorothy out as a character, but adds meaning to the Oz sequences. She yearns to be taken away to a faraway land, only to discover that once she's there she faces simply a fanciful version of the problems she was running away from at home.The book, in contrast, gave hardly any detail about Dorothy's Kansas life. Baum's Dorothy was consequently a more passive character, victim to circumstances beyond her control, and her journey to Oz was merely a random, insane event with no bearing on anything other than that it made for an entertaining tale. The movie gave her a will and purpose that Baum's protagonist never had. When she mournfully longs to be sent home, it resonates more strongly than in the book because we know the real cause of her separation wasn't the tornado but her own actions.Adapting the book to the screen thus involved a bundle of wise decisions, made all the more impressive because when you read about what was happening behind the scenes, you're struck by how much could have gone wrong. The film went through no fewer than five directors. Judy Garland was first told to play Dorothy with a blonde wig and baby-doll makeup. ""Over the Rainbow"" was almost cut from the film. Margaret Hamilton suffered severe burns from a scene where she disappears in a cloud of smoke, the original actor to play Tin Man had to quit when his face paint made him ill, and the dog playing Toto had to be replaced after an actor stepped on the animal. These stories, which have been part of Hollywood lore for many decades, make the filming of ""Wizard of Oz"" sound more like a comedy routine than the creation of a classic.As an expensive, high-tech production for its time, the movie could easily have lost sight of its spirit, as so many big-budget spectacles today do. Instead, it not only remained true to Baum's vision but infused it with additional layers of meaning that speak to people of all ages, in all generations. If you've never read the book, I encourage you to do so, if for no other reason than to gain a greater appreciation for what the movie accomplished.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Essential American Film,"It seems that few films age well, as audiences grow used the high end production, special effects and various technologies that are integral to today's movies. The Wizard of Oz, on the contrary, remains a true classic, one that withstands the test of time as both an unforgettable visual work of art and a fantastic piece of storytelling. The film is adapted from L. Frank Baum's novel of a similar title, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Although it is not traditionally regarded as fairy tale, it contains several recognizable elements of one, such as themes of childhood and a conflict of good and evil.The film was quite groundbreaking for it's time, being one of the first movies shot in Technicolor. One of the most under-appreciated aspects of the film is its cinematography. The story begins in sepia tone, with the main character, Dorothy. Following a chaotic sequence involving a tornado in which she is knocked unconscious, the movie really starts to get interesting. The camera jumps to a long- shot frame of her house falling rapidly through the sky, only for it to land with her unharmed. Dorothy climbs out of bed, and the screen slowly pans to the right as she walks over to the door. This creates an air of suspense, and when she opens the door to look outside, the audience sees a fantasy landscape bursting with color. The way in which the movie transitions to Technicolor is beautifully done, and could even be described as psychedelic. Now that is how you grab an audience's attention.The Wizard of Oz is a brilliantly scripted movie with a story that all ages can enjoy. There is hardly a dull moment for the entire 101-minute run time, and the tale of Dorothy and the people she meets flows seamlessly. Dorothy's friends, named the Cowardly Lion, the Tin Woodman, and the Scarecrow are all engaging. They are classic fairy tail characters- lovable, but retain human qualities and self-perceived flaws. The dialogue amongst them is quirky and fun, adding humor and comedic relief to a film primarily about adventure.Dorothy is sixteen years old, however she carries the demeanor of a child throughout the story. She is portrayed as naïve and blunt, and needs reassurance and support from her friends. As with many fairy tales, her end goal is to make it back home to Kansas. Another overarching theme in the movie that is common to fairy tales is the conflict of good and evil that Dorothy gets stuck between, where there is an ongoing battle between Glinda the Good Witch of the East and the Wicked Witch of the West. Without giving away any spoilers, The Wizard of Oz surprisingly includes revenge and death (something native to traditional fairy tales) within this ongoing battle, something you certainly wouldn't encounter in today's world within a movie marketed for children. The obvious influence of classic fairy tales goes over quiet well, and gives the story another layer of complexity, granting lessons for children to learn from the story while providing older audiences themes to analyze and compare to fairy tales they grew up watching.The story of Dorothy's journey through Oz is more than just an adventure with an added fairy tale twist. The Wizard of Oz is a classic film, an American staple, and a masterfully crafted work of art. Everyone, from kids to parents and casual movie goers to film buffs can appreciate this movie. The Wizard of Oz isn't just a must- watch, it's a necessary watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Wizard Of Oz : From The Books To Today,"*This review is dedicated to my parents ,who were born in the 1930s.*I'll start by saying that many here say ,read the books ,they're better. Well, sure they are. I've read the 14 books by Frank L. Baum and they're classic American literature and simply fun to read as well.Frank L. Baum ,was a man with an imagination ,in a time and place in America ,when men weren't supposed to (or sometimes not allowed to) have one ,after they grew up. (For better insight into Mr. Baum and his books ,watch John Ritter's portrayal in the NBC, 1990 film ,""The Dreamer of Oz.""The 1st filmed version was in 1925 but was laced with both personal & racial stereotypes. As well as being a bit uneven. Nearly 15 years after that version ,came the film that really ,is the first live action movie made for young people. (Kids were not exactly a priority in the early days of movie making.)Now ,over the years ,many have complained that despite the positive message ,the humor and the happy songs sung in the film...it's very dark in many places. If you stop and think about it ...doesn't that sound like many of the movies ,for kids, made during the last 30+ years?The film's also accused of being 'heavy-handed' in it's attempt to make it's point. The 1930s 'were' a very gloomy time and this being a first attempt at this kind of movie ,it couldn't possibly have come across any other way.The people who went and saw this film in '39 ,not only saw the future of movies (unknowingly) but a reflection of their own era. Dorothy & family live on a farm in Kansas ,in the Depression and are threatened by a powerful woman with money ,who feels she can bully and threaten them because she has more than they do.In that situation (and given that no one takes her seriously because she's a kid) Dorothy ,maybe like many in that time, wishes she could be someplace better and that place must be on the other side of rainbow.This isn't just something little children or kids could think. Adults can feel this way as well. What adult wouldn't want to escape the sometimes heavy responsibilities & problems of life ,that they didn't have to deal with as a kid?Sure ,Dorothy finds problems when she gets to Oz. What kind of movie would it be if there weren't any? It'd be one giant tea party with music.In learning the lesson of 'there's no place like home' and that in seeking one ,'she should look no further than her own backyard' ,Dorothy has to see that no matter where you go, no place is perfect or without its problems....even Munchkinland.The witch is a severe problem. Scarecrow , Tin Man , Cowardly Lion and even the Wizard ,all have problems too.Dorothy's in a beautiful land but wants to leave it ,which is another problem. She got what she thought she wanted but realized ,she didn't.She wanted to be home with her family. With all the 'dark' things she goes through ,she does what most of us would do ,she fights for it! With help from her new friends in Oz. When she melts the witch, intended or not ,it was her passing the last test ,to get herself home.A test as well from Glinda ,because she knew why Dorothy had landed in Oz and she helped her see the reality of where it was she truly belonged. Could she have told Dorothy this ,yes ,but would she listen ,anymore than she'd have believed shoes could get her home instantly?All of the things many love The Wizard Of Oz for ,are either things we experience in our lives or that we wish we could do.This movie isn't just for little children or kids ,it's for everyone,of any age. I've watched it on CBS as a kid ,on video and DVD and in 1998 ,I got the pleasure of seeing it in a special 're-release' to movie theaters ,on the big screen..... And The Wizard Of Oz , is for anyone who simply likes a good movie ,like I do. That and manymore reasons are why I rate it 10 stars.Aside from the lesson ,the real reason to watch the movie ,is to enjoy yourself. Nothing more or less than that. The characters,the story ,the songs ,the scenery and going from black & white to color in a blink...all a part of telling the world's simplest story of how there's no place like home. ...and home can be a house or even the real world we live in ,where we take the bad with the good.That's something that's as true today as it was over 75 years ago. {END]",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The ultimate family movie,"Dorothy Gale and her dog Toto are carried away by a powerful tornado to the far away land of Oz.This is one of the greatest movies produced by the Hollywood industry and stands the test of 81 years.The way it showcases its technicolour sequences is an example of how to maximise the impact of a technology during the film making process. I will never tire of watching Dorothy open her front door and see the colour pouring in. I can only imagine what audiences must have thought in 1939.The quality of the sets and the ingenuity of the special effects are excellent when you consider the era and compare it to the vast amount of lower quality spectacle produced years later.The story, based on the Baum's book, has been analysed to death for its political allegory and what the characters and colours represent which makes it even more interesting for adult viewers.All performances are superb with Judy Garland carrying the lead role perfectly whilst being well supported by the rest of the cast. Bert Lahr exhibits so much charisma and timing as the Cowardly Lion he very nearly steals the show. One scene where he struts about pretending to be a king feels spontaneous and is probably my favourite scene.I am and never will be a fan of musicals but this one feels different, as if the same emotion couldn't be translated to its audience any other way. They are instantly memorable songs, especially the famous 'Somewhere Over The Rainbow"".What gives it the ultimate credit in my eyes is the impact it has on viewers of all ages. My daughters have watched it repeatedly from two and three years old, singing along, laughing and hiding behind a cushion at all the appropriate moments. I hardly had to explain a single frame of it to them because the visual storytelling is that good. At the same time their ninety year old Great Grandfather still remembers and enjoys it with them.This is a truly landmark production and you can see where much of the inspiration regarding cinematic spectacle came from in the decades that followed.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

An Unforgettable Classic!,"The Wizard of Oz, is no doubt, a cinematic class that breathes new life with each generation. Despite the film being released 76 years ago, it is still one of those rare gems that clicks with today's audience. Sure it has a rather simple story, but it's a resonant film that features groundbreaking visuals (that famous twister scene, anyone?), themes that can relate to anyone (courage, having a heart, etc), famous music that became a part of pop culture lore, and just a simple fantasy story that is fun to watch and is suitable for all ages. The story itself has the feel of a 1939 movie, but those visuals are still mightily impressive. The twister scene is just amazing, and it still fathoms me to see how they created all the flying objects seem realistic. The production design is amazing as well, as we get a very colorful film. Keep in mind that during this era, most films were black and white. The yellow brick road is a delight to look at, especially occupied by the central characters.The story is simple enough to follow, and it's one for all ages. Dorothy is whisked away from her Kansas farmland by a tornado, and it transports her to the magical land of Oz. Dorothy desperately wants to go home, but she is tasked with finding the wizard of Oz in Emerald City. She must follow the yellow brick road, where she finds allies in a talking scarecrow, a tin man, and a cowardly lion. But she also must avoid the Wicked Witch of the West if she wants to get home safely.The film is full of pure, magical performances. Judy Garland, a well- known name in 1939, was transported to stardom after the success of this movie. Her acting method is different by today's standard, but she effectively carries the movie as the kind-hearted Dorothy. Margaret Hamilton's performance was very scary, and rumor has it that much of her performance was edited due to it being scary. I imagine what her performance could have been if there was no editing. I also liked Ray Bolger, as the scarecrow trying to find a brain, Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lion looking for courage, and Jack Haley as the tin man looking for a heart. Everyone delivers praise-worthy performances here.While not an instant box-office success when first released, the Wizard of Oz delivers magic, wisdom, and just a great movie to the audience all around the world. From the magical tunes of ""Somewhere over the Rainbow,"" to the interplay between Miss Gulch and Dorothy, to the experience with the Wizard of Oz, we have ourselves an unforgettable classic, which began with the writings of L. Frank Baum. I have seen this film many times, and it is still a fantastic delight to watch. Once I'm transported to Oz, ""I'm no place like home,"" as Dorothy so kindly tells Toto, her dog. Once again, a classic movie for all ages.My Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A story for discovering,"By 1939, the U.S. qualified director Victor Fleming, had made 39 films, and ""THE WIZARD OF OZ"" became his third major children's film after ""Treasure Island"" and ""Captains Courageous"". With this trilogy, was already part of the immortals of film. Based on the book by Frank Baum, ""THE WIZARD OF OZ"" is the story of a beautiful dream. Lesson for a girl named Dorothy, and for all children - and adults - of the world, some of those things that we spend looking outside, when in fact we have inside. Four unforgettable characters we recreate these values: a scarecrow (intelligence), a tin man (feeling), a lion (courage) and little Dorothy (the family warmth).All they travel, by a witch enchanted land and on board in search of a known character called The Wizard of Oz from whom they hope they can recover what they consider to be lost. And this, with great wisdom, giving them the opportunity to act, they should watch.""Extract from within you all the values you claim. The values are within us, only must flow"". ""I must find what I want out, because it is there will not be anywhere else."" ""Many people own symbols, but are not really what these symbols represent"". ""The value of a man is not determined by how much he loves, but by how much he is loved"". Fundamental lessons for life in the home, in the street, at work or study. Lessons allow us to be and should not ever forget.""THE WIZARD OF OZ"" fun, looks with delight, one falls in love with his characters, unrestricted travel by that fantasy world that never grows old, and Judy Garland singing ""Over the Rainbow"", carved bear it in your memory forever. And finally, there is one with the feeling of seeing something beautiful, something meaningful.I see no objection. It is a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Off to see the Wizard and Dorothy and Toto too!,"The Wizard of Oz has survived, thrived, and often influenced great works like Broadway's Wicked musical based on the evil witch who died. The story from L. Frank Baum's novel of the same name is adapted again but starring the wonderful Judy Garland as Dorothy, a role that never really escaped her identity. Margaret Hamilton, a former school teacher would play the evil witch in this version. The supporting cast of characters included munchkins that earned a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The munchkins introduced it's audiences to dwarf sized adults many of us for the first time. The Wizard of Oz and it's unforgettable cast of characters included in the Tin Man, the Scarecrow, and the Cowardly Lion. The film version has inspired spoofs and countless attempts to recapture it's brilliance. The cast and crew are unforgettable in developing one of the finest film classics of our time and with Judy's Over the Rainbow performance, you won't forget her ever.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An Old School Masterpiece at work!,"If there is a movie that I would consider to be the best movie of the 1930s, it would be this one! I would also say that this is the best movie with a tornado in it. Yes Tornados have been in other movies later on in time. But this... this is next level. The colors, music, and effects are beautiful as well! When my grandmother introduced me to this movie, I will admit that I was VERY impressed with it in the end. I always loved the music and the singing. Even though I'm more of an action themed movie goer, This movie is an acceptance. I hope that this movie will be fun to watch in the future!

The songs are great, the characters are some of the most likable in history, it never feels slow, and it is just so entertaining. The effects for the time were great. The colors are bright and energetic. Do I really need to say anything about this film. People have said that they love it for years and they will continue for years. It is one of my favorites also. It brings a smile to my face watching it. It makes me feel good to be part of something that is passed down from generation to generation like a baseball glove that belonged to your grandfather, or a ring that belonged to your grandmother.

Perfect Fantasy,"How many times have I watched this over the course of nearly 60 years? Too many to remember.Yes, there's nostalgia, but this film really has everything you need in good film:
> Good Story
> Great Acting
> Good DirectingThis checks all of those, and with bright Oz-green check-marks.Here's my breakdown:STORY:
For its era, and to some extent since, the story is unusually creative, but not like so many LSD-type stories, e.g.""Alice in Wonderland"" or as renamed ""Alice on Mushrooms."" This really holds together end-to-end because
it balances both ""feet on the ground"" pragmatism with an ethereal arch that stretches, yeah, yeah ... over ...I tried to find holes, chop, misdirection, or just sloppiness, but there's not much to criticize here. If there's
one thing, though ... While I'm saddened to see witchcraft insidiously crawl the cracks into American values
through media, that's life, and has to do with my traditional values and not the film's quality.Note: Regarding the Wizard's remarks to his patrons while granting them their wishes, and what's needed to
achieve them:? - Brains require Food and food requires Money (and teaching parents and low-cost universities)
? - The Heart is not judged as in a Popularity contest - only God will judge the heart
? - Courage has nothing to do with War medals, but requires deep values that one stands onACTING:
Nice job by the whole cast, really, but my heart goes out to the Cowardly Lion and Toto. Seriously, that dog
should have been given an Oscar, or a life-time supply of hotdogs.ENTERTAINMENT:
High valueTEMPO:
Nicely pacedCINEMATOGRAPHY:
It's one massive set if you just look deep enough, but! Someone went out of their way to make a 1939 fantasy
look like a real / imaginary place. Kudos.MUSIC / SOUND:
Normally, I loathe musicals. But the singing here feels necessary, sort of like ""The Sound of Music"" (1965).DIRECTING / WRITING:
Director: I'm glad Fleming did this as he's got a nice touch across a wide range of genre.Writers: I don't recognize their other work (much), so can't comment on portfolios. Superb work here.Is it a good film? Yes!Should you watch this once? Yes, at least.Rating: 9.0 (Toto gets at least 1 bone)",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Just As Magical and Fresh Today As It Was 60 Years Ago!,"What's left to say about this film?  If you looked up the word ""perfection"" in the dictionary, you're likely to find it's picture.  Judy Garland will always live in this film.  Knowing what we do about her personal life doesn't subtract from her performance at all.  If anything, her stories of personal tragedy and drug abuse, only makes her more effective.  We know that quiver in her voice and the sadness behind her eyes were real.  I cannot watch this film with out getting a little nostalgic for her.The rest of the cast, especially Boldger and Hamilton, are also flawless, the special effects are still stunning, and the film's moral will never grow old.My score:  a perfect 10!

The only reason I didn't rate this 1 star is the fact that I am aware that it was filmed in the, like, 1930s so I guess there were different standards back then.

An epic magical fantasy that stands the test of time,"The Wizard of Oz is an amazing movie. It was made in 1939, and it has held up very well. Because of the way they made the movie, the special effects still look really great, it is really beautiful visually, and there's nothing that would need to change if they made it nowadays (2023). It has one of the most enduring and emotionally powerful songs of any movie, Over the Rainbow. Judy Garland was never better. The Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Lion are fantastic, magical heroes. The whole movie is magical.It bears repeated viewings and never gets old. When I was a kid in the 1970s they were showing it once a year on TV. It was a special occasion, kind of exciting in those days. For me as an adult now, it still is just as much so.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Toto,"To me, Toto holds The Wizard of Oz together. Toto plays a key role in the movie, so it's likely that the movie would not have been as good without her:
Toto, a purebred Cairn Terrier, was born in 1933 in Alta Dena, California. She was named Terry.Toto was endearing and lovable from the beginning of the movie. The genuine love Dorothy showed Toto made me pay close attention to all of Toto's movements and gestures. Toto put her heart and soul into the movie and all of the actors adored her, and it showed. I was invested in Toto's reactions and the fun it looked like she was having while acting in the movie. I was worried for her safety during the cyclone, because she touched my heart.Dorothy's motivation: Toto is the reason Dorothy runs away from home at the beginning of the movie. She wants to save him from being put to sleep by the sheriff after Miss Gulch complains that Toto bit her. Revealing the Wizard's deception: Toto pulls away the curtain to reveal that the Wizard is a fake.Some of my review is from AI, some is me.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Wizard vs Wicked: Wizard Still Reigns as Most Magical Adaption of Baum, Far Better than ""Wicked"".","The 1939 MGM production of ""The Wizard of Oz"" still stands as the best theatrical adaption of L. Frank Baum's timeless classic. The songs, although maybe a little light-hearted by today's standards, are still the best and the most memorable of any other production, be they film or musical. The witty lyrics by Yip Harburg withstand on their own terms and help feed into the rhetoric and humor of the story, particularly ""Over the Rainbow"", ""The Wicked Witch is Dead"", and ""If I were King of the Forest"". The cast is perfect, the sets incredible, and the effects stand-up well against many CGI films today. And the script retains the spirit of Baum's original novel but never lapses into too much gushy sentimentality.The cast have become immortalized in their own right. Who could imagine anyone else playing Dorothy other than the young Judy Garland whose rendition of ""Over the Rainbow"" still brings tears even after 70 years? Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lion was a choice made in Heaven. Lahr, who was probably the most experienced Vaudevillian in the cast, practically steals the show with his rendition of ""If I were King of the Forest"", which he sings to the hilt in a manner reminiscent of Ethel Merman. His only rivals are Maragaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch of the West who seems like she was born to play the role of Dorothy's arch-enemy, and Frank Morgan as the wizard. Morgan, like Lahr, brings a theatrical quality to the entire production as he plays four different characters on-screen. Billie Burke as Glinda, Ray Bolger as the Scarecrow, and Jack Hayley as the Tin Man also deserve honorable mention.The well-known story concerns a Midwest farm girl, Dorothy, who goes on an unexpected trip to a faraway land known as Oz. Her line ""I've a feeling we're not in Kansas any more."" has become one of the most quoted in the annals of motion pictures. It is practically an allusion meaning to be in an unknown place. After making enemies with the Wicked Witch of the West, Dorothy desires to return home. She is told that the only person in Oz who can help her is the great Wizard who resides in the Emerald City. Along her journey to the city, she befriends three of the most famous characters of children's literature: a scare crow, a tin man and a cowardly lion. Together they seek audience with the great Wizard of Oz. The only Hollywood shortcoming is that the entire experience is related as a dream which was not how it was characterized in the original book. Still a triumph of early cinema that seems like it could have been made just a few years ago instead of a half century plus a score of years ago. A must for children.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Essence of Decency,"Easily, the sweetest, most charming, and most thoroughly optimistically American movie you will ever see, The Wizard of Oz stands as a testament to the creativity and decency that was Hollywood seventy years ago. The film version of the Baum novel captures the best of what we are as a people and as a species. I can find no flaw in the film.My suggestion for you--if you haven't seen TWOZ in awhile--is to grab a restored copy from the late '90s. But if you have an old tape from CBS, pop it in anyway. When the news blares that the price of a barrel of oil is topping $100+ or the body of a baby was found in a dumpster or some other ghastly event, big or small, chills you to the core, watch Dorothy and her thoroughly human compadres go on their quest to find what they already had in the first place.Take heart.

Combine glamor to cult and make believe it has some real value. Not that this picture is very glamorous, granted. It's merely insane and ""predictable"" is not even the word. This is bad. But you like it because you have been successfully brainwashed. Some say the acting of the bad witch was the only thing that possessed some quality, but I thought she was merely failing to act.

Greatest Fantasy Film Ever?,"The magic that this film creates cannot be denied by the few humbugs that find it boring or only for kids.  This is a film masterpiece THAT has stood the test of time.  Its magic has not decreased but increased.  I will not go into everything which has already been gone over.  Obviously the music, the sets, Judy Garland, the rest of the cast, and everything else is something special.  I grew up with this film;  I waited eagerly every Easter for it to come on TV.  What particularly works for me?  The film has the MGM musical tradition behind it and dancers and singers in roles, but the story and creativity and diversity of the musical score attract me.  Margaret Hamilton makes an outstanding witch too!  The film has some remarkable scenes: the field laden with poppy flowers, the flying monkeys carrying Dorothy away, the guards ho-he-hoing at the castle, and of course Munchkintown and its citizens.  Though the years have passed by rather quickly, I still have an enormous respect for this film and a great desire to still watch it for the fiftieth plus time.

Go for the midgets leave for the tripe.,"Why oh why oh why does this film keep getting good reviews? Ignore everything you've heard from your friends, its not 'timeless' its not 'classic', its not 'a gem', its not 'perfect film making' its not even average. Its sick in a bin, sick that no one has put any effort into hurling, sick that is now worshipped by legions of morons.A plot that your racist two year old thought up in a dream, a cast that would make Vin Diesel vomit in fear, a soundtrack that has you slicing your ears off and salting the wounds, direction reminiscent of Eastenders and a dog that, lets face it just needs putting down.There is a common misconception that all pre 1950 films are in the least watchable; this just isn't the case. It's fans, blinded by the fact that this was the first colour film, the fact that Judy Garland is 'acting' and the fact that it has the happiest of happy endings stoically worship, with unrelenting and unquestioning faith, not even stopping for a second to think that maybe their favourite film is worse than being kicked in the face.So watch The Wizard of Oz, but please keep your mind open. Remember the conventions of a 'good' film and observe how they apply to this one. They don't. We ask don't listen to the hype, the myth or the legend, form your own opinion on this piece of dog mess.The film's only saving grace was the stroke of genius that led them to casting real midgets as the Munchkins which subsequently led to the hilarious tragedy of one the diminutive stars hanging themselves.

The film was based on the novel and ever since it's release, it has been recognized through out decade after decade, and till this day, people could still confirm this film as a great movie from their childhood.

The visual style is still fantastic, even to this day. It's like a flash of color in your eyes, and that Emerald City still shines like a diamond. The characters are still great. Dorathy is a farm girl who's tired of her life in the farm and dreams of a world full of imagination. Scarecrow is without a brain. Tinman is a human tin without a heart, though is still sentimental and compassionate. The Cowardly Lion is a hilarious Lion who's...well, a coward. And The Wicked Witch is a symbol of childhood fears. Man I remember how much she scared me when I was a child. That black attire, green skin and cackling voice would have kids running for their moms. What else is there to say. The music is done very well and the musical numbers are great. My favorite is when the lion sings about what his life would be if he had the nerve to become king of the forest. Then there's one of the most memorable songs ,sung by Judy Garland, that will live in all our hearts and never be forgotten from time to time.This film will go on and on for generations to come. If you have kids of your own, give yourself the time to introduce this film, they might have the same effect for their childhoods as ours did.

Hidden third layer,"One of those films that helps define the conscience of western civilisation  full of those little homilies that the generations pass down. A hundred of them are crystallised here in this film. The theme is wanting things without realising that you have them all the time, a dream whose moral is to stop dreaming. It's still sweet and funny, only occasionally veering too far into the world of cartoonery. I could have done without Toto and the blasted Munchkins  though the Lollypop Guild trio are worth seeing. Shirley Temple was considered for the part and would have been good, but then the film would have been without its essence, which, on deep reflection, is July Garland's sexual innocence. Dorothy might well have gone to the Wizard asking for desirability, without realising that she was already the hottest thing in the Land of Oz. The Wicked Witch of the West was clearly envious of Dorothy's beauty  that must have been the real power of those ruby slippers.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

"""And my head, I'd be scratchin/While my thoughts were busy hatchin/If I only had a brain...""","We all know this is a classic which has more than withstood the test of time, so just some thoughts: Why would Dorothy want to go back to that god-forsaken farm instead of living in Oz, a place where Technicolor might've been invented? She didn't seem to get much love from anybody in Kansas, and Elvira Gulch is bound to come back for the dog (providing the cyclone didn't kill her). Another thought: Why is Glinda such a masochist? She appears to watch out over Dorothy and her friends from the heavens, but where is she when they really need her? Why are the residents of Oz so happy to see the Wizard leave? It's a big celebration, yet he's their ruler! Wouldn't they be sad to see him go? Also, there is no scene depicting the Wizard's unmasking of himself to the people of his city. How do they know he's the Wizard? Has he been behind that curtain since he arrived? A sketchy plot like this--which invites more questions than it answers--really shouldn't result in such a joyous picture, but it does. I remember when they re-released this to theaters in 1972 (after years of showing the thing on TV every year) and people lined-up down the street to see it again. That's the power of good movies.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wizard of Oz (1939),"The Wizard of Oz is an all time classic and a complete masterpiece. I've probably watched this movie over 100 times. It was and still is my favorite growing up. I was obsessed with Dorothy and Toto, and terrified of the Wicked Witch of the West. I absolutely love the way they filmed this masterpiece. The transition from black and white to beautiful colors was unique and different which made the movie so special. Even in present times, most people know about the Wizard of Oz and they still have musicals for it. If you haven't seen it, or your kids haven't seen it, I strongly recommend this movie to anyone at any age. The scarecrow and the cowardly lion are hilarious. The colors and the scenery was amazingly put together. One of my most favorite scenes of the movie is when they all fall asleep in the poppy field and get woken up by snow. Everything about that scene was beautiful, even the music.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"After almost 70 years, still the most vivid and colorful film of all time!","And knowing a little more about film, and about quality, I have to say, it truly is an unforgettable movie. I will start with it's visual styles. To this day, I have never seen a more colorful film in my life. To think that it was the year 1939, wow. The costume designs were so amazing. It had to use a lot, and the were so original and beautiful. The make-up done on the Wicked Witch, and a bunch of other creatures and being, just pure genius. Also, this is a film that when it ends, it leaves you in 'awe'. Like not really wanting it to end. It leaves you feeling for everybody.It's lesson is so simple, but I always forget it, along with others. Our families DO hold us together. It's storytelling is so pure and bewitching. The effects done on the twister are great. Every scene holds a visually stunning work of art. Great cinematography. And what really makes this film, it's amazing characters. Sure to stay with more generations to come. Definitely has to have a soft spot on everybody's list. How could it not?",,Anonymous,Fantasy

Absolute classic!,"The Wizard of Oz (1939) is an absolute classic and I have always loved this film ever since I was a kid. It's just perfect for a family to watch together and enjoy. The script is packed with good hearted dialogue, some humor, and a lot of fun adventure. The cast does very well. I love Judy Garland and not only was she a great actress, but a wonderful singer too. Somewhere over the rainbow is of course a classic song and garland performs it wonderfully. There are many other musical numbers throughout the rest of the film that are done very well. The visuals are from 1939, so of course you can't expect them to be great, but I still think they're bright and fun, in a classic way. The acting is great from all cast members, there are moments between the characters that have great chemistry and add depth to the movie as a whole.

"Warts and All, Remarkable","Had the great pleasure of seeing WOZ at the Uptown Theatre last weekend. No other film in my recollection has ""evolved"" with successive viewings like this has: from my first time seeing it on black & white t.v. in 1967 at age 5 (a REAL journey, much longer than a mere two hours!); the realization nearly ten years later that 80% of the picture is in C O L O R; up through a couple of years ago, watching it needlessly truncated on commercial t.v. on a non-Easter Friday night (when the two hours felt like 20 minutes, if that). So I was ready for the ""genuine"" widescreen, three-strip Technicolor movie-theatre experience.The result: well, it was like having known about ""the man behind the curtain"" but not accepting it until now. I'm old enough to see the poor continuity (the Tin Man's funnel-hat handle switches sides at least once), the primitive make-up, the once-magical backgrounds that are now clearly movie sets,  that Dorothy had quite a rack for a twelve-year-old;-),and so on. And as for ""Munchkinland,"" we won't even GO THERE.But it doesn't matter. Oh, the COLORS: the burnt fuschia of the hourglass sand, the genuine ruby of Dorothy's slippers, the repulsive green of the Witch's skin versus the entire green spectrum in the Emerald City. And there's nothing like seeing it with an adult audience: old enough to know all the lines and all the lyrics, booing and clapping and cheering right on cue (and laughing heartily where we never dared laugh before). WOZ may be one of the very few things this culture has produced that allows you to enjoy it as both a grown-up and the kid you once were -- and maybe still are -- without feeling the least bit self-conscious about it.

The great Garland,"""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939) is a cinematic masterpiece that has enchanted audiences for decades with its blend of fantasy, music, and unforgettable characters. From the moment Dorothy steps into the magical land of Oz, the film draws viewers into a vibrant world filled with wonder, adventure, and timeless lessons.Judy Garland's portrayal of Dorothy is the heart of the movie, capturing the character's innocence and determination with grace. Her rendition of ""Over the Rainbow"" remains one of the most iconic moments in film history, perfectly capturing the longing for a place where dreams come true. The supporting cast, including the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion, bring warmth and humor to the journey, each adding depth to the story with their unique quests for brains, heart, and courage.The transition from sepia-toned Kansas to the Technicolor brilliance of Oz is one of cinema's most magical moments, highlighting the film's groundbreaking use of color and special effects. The imaginative set designs, from the glittering Emerald City to the dark, twisted forest, create a world that feels both fantastical and strangely familiar.The film's enduring appeal lies not just in its visual splendor, but in its universal themes of friendship, bravery, and the idea that home is where the heart is. The Wicked Witch of the West, played with delicious menace by Margaret Hamilton, remains one of the most memorable villains, adding a touch of darkness that balances the film's whimsy.""The Wizard of Oz"" is more than just a beloved classic; it's a cultural touchstone that continues to inspire and entertain audiences of all ages. Its blend of fantasy, music, and heart ensures that it remains a timeless treasure in the world of cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Overcoming One's Own Character Limitations is a Daunting Task,"Overcoming one's own character limitations in youth is a necessary but a daunting task. Those who resign themselves to the safe harbor of postponing efforts to take on risks and challenges have their character development set in time. The characters in the movie, the cowardly lion, the heartless tin man, and brainless scarecrow all symbolize the character flaws in Dorothy's real life adult friends back home. To some degree, Dorothy collectively had each one of those flaws. We see in Dorothy an intelligence, courageous, and a good-hearted young lady. When Dorothy suffers a concussion and drifts into a coma, she mentally commits herself to overcoming those flaws. A mental challenge known as the trip down the ""yellow brick road."" Her initial expectation was to painlessly be cured by Wizard of Oz and sent home. The Wizard, however, prescribed an arduous journey that would put to test all her capacities. She would have to confront evil in the world, in the form of the Wicked Witch of the West. From her trial and tribulations would emerge her renewed self. In the process, she would show care, compassion, and a deep concern for her companion's safety and well-being over her own. It was Dorothy's final act of forgiveness and concern towards one who would do her harm that would put her over the threshold.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Surprisingly Impressed,"Like most people on Planet Earth who aren't six feet under, I grew up watching The Wizard of Oz as a child.  To this day I have never read the book.  I enjoyed the movie, but it really had its biggest impact on me as an adult.  Before, it was just a family film that I would watch with my cousins every year.I watched it a few years ago out of curiosity more than anything, expecting to cringe at how corny it would be.  But I was actually amazed at how realistic the movie feels.First of all, I don't like musicals as a general rule but I didn't mind this movie at all.  The songs were quite good actually.The actors were completely believable for the most part.  I know some people think they were a bit over the top.  But I don't remember thinking that. Judy Garland, at least plays the part of Dorothy perfectly well (remember, I haven't read the book) and is easy to connect with (very important for the main character).  I heard from someone that they were considering Shirley Temple for the part but she was under contract with someone else and they wouldn't let her be in it.  And I heard that she was crushed so they put her in a fantasy movie of her own called The Blue Bird (I haven't seen it).The sets were really good.  Although you can tell they are just sets, they're done so well that it still feels right anyway.  I can't believe that Gone With the Wind won Best Art Direction over this movie.  Wizard of Oz should have at least won an oscar for that.  I think it got Best Song for Over the Rainbow and that was all!Another thing that makes this movie great is it's ability to be heart warming and scary.  I was waiting for the Wicked Witch to appear thinking that I'd crack a smile at how silly she was.  But to be perfectly honest, she was quite intimidating.  She wasn't silly at all and she was very mean and threatening in every scene she was in.  I couldn't understand it. This old woman with a green face was completely nasty and horrible without actually physically killing or torturing anyone throughout the entire film. Let's see a modern movie villain pull that off!  The movie gets particularly suspensful when they get to the castle.I also liked how Dorothy's companions all have the traits that they're searching for.  The Tin Man who doesn't have a heart is a big softy who's always crying; the Scarecrow who supposedly doesn't have a brain is always coming up with the good ideas;  but the problem is that the Lion really is a coward!  I suppose someone will say that true courage is facing danger when you're afraid of it blah, blah, blah.....but I remember one scene where the Lion actually runs away and jumps out the window.  And he also gets more songs than the others too.  Oh well, a cowardly lion is more amusing than a brave one I guess.I think this movie is really for adults more than kids.  Oh, kids will like it, of course.  But there are levels of depth in it that only an adult can relate to (that's what I think).  I had to keep myself from getting teary eyed when Dorothy was trapped in the tower with the crystal ball and I don't remember being affected by this scene like that when I was little.I'm sure everyone who reads this review has probably seen this movie a trillion times.  But if you haven't, I highly recommend it.  And this recommendation is coming from a guy who usually won't watch a movie unless it has a broadsword or a machine gun in it......or a vampire.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

The Wizard of Oz,"' I got introduced to the movie, The Wizard of Oz around the age of 5, I can't remember why I wanted to watch this movie but to this day, I am glad I did. What pulled me in at such a young age was when Dorthy got to Oz, and everything was magical. The first few times I watched it, I thought it was scary because of the witches but growing up, I now like that the witches are part of the movie. Now, this is a go-to movie for me, I love the songs, and of course - the characters. Each song goes well with the movie and the characters have their own personality and it pulls the whole movie and friendships that are made in this movie together. If I were to go up to someone who is younger than me I am sure they are unsure what this movie is, and that is sad but it is old, ( 1939 ), but it sure is a good watch. Every year, around Halloween when kids would dress up to trick or treat, for a few years in a row, I would want to be Dorthy for Halloween and never once did I forget my sparkly red shoes leaving for the day, even when we had gym that day at school. This movie is for all ages to enjoy and there's always something happening you won't be able to stop and make more popcorn. It starts off with the tornado and then Dorthy meets all sorts of friends down the yellow brick road, like the Scarecrow, Tin man, Lion, Witches, and so many more. Each one is looking for something, but you have to watch it to find out! If you enjoy The Lord Of The Rings, you would enjoy this movie. But you have to watch it to find out!

"Fantastic, greatly (re)watchable, musical masterpiece for the whole family","""The Wizard of Oz"" starring Judy Garland and directed by Victor Fleming, director of ""Gone in the Wind"" is undeniably one of the all-time great musicals and, not only for the revolutionary, beautifully colourful visuals, the first-time-seen-in-the-big-screen alternation between sepia tones and Technicolor, the skillful and exhilarating storytelling that holds the viewer's interest from beginning to end and the joyful musical numbers accompanied by extremely catchy songs, but also for its overarching message about courage, insistence, inventiveness and kindness, which is by no means didactic and doesn't take away from the entertainment the film delivers. The choreography is very successful and aligned with the film's pace, direction is great as well, the set design is impeccable, with lush visual detail in every sequence, the soundtrack is perfectly fit for every scene, Judy Garland steals the show as the young girl whose character develops through her adventure, and as I see it, there is something to enjoy for everyone in the family in this motion picture. All the above reasons define this film as a tremendously enjoyable classic with timeless and intergenerational appeal (it is one of the most incessantly revisited pictures of all time), which is thoroughly uplifting and highly recommended for all moviegoers who haven't seen it yet, but for the ones who have done so and have remained ""young in the heart"" (as the card in the start of the picture says), as well.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

What childhood would be without it?,"My Take: In almost every way, a landmark in cinema history.After seeing James Cameron's AVATAR yesterday, I think it would be wise to reminisce on the one movie that started it all. Nope, not STAR WARS. It's none other than Victor Fleming's THE WIZARD OF OZ. Yes, all the magic, all the wonders and all the visual accomplishments that we have come to achieve today began in 1939 when Dorothy and Toto set foot on Oz, with the mundane Sepia transforming into pristine Technicolor, as seen for the very first time. Ever since then, THE WIZARD OF OZ has become part of the movie-going culture that it's almost virtually impossible that anyone has not seen it, at least once.I admit it's been a long time since I saw OZ (the last time, I think, was when I was introducing it for the first time to my little brothers), but the memory of seeing it will forever be etched into my mind. Here's a bit of cinema that's hard to forget. Almost everything about it spells ""classic"" or ""landmark cinema"". That's a lot to be said about a movie which only started out as a family film, based on L. Frank Baum's books, about a little girl (Garland) and her dog carried away by a freak tornado into a land populated by a good witch, a wicked witch, a walking scarecrow, a heartless Tin Man, a cowardly Lion and a wonderful wizard we have all come to know and love.The music has since become part of culture (I can no longer recall how many times me and a friend of mine quite ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow"" during conversations) and the visuals, although not as flashy today, are still as visibly groundbreaking and still absolutely gorgeous. Indeed, the Ruby Slippers are still a treasure, the Emerald City still as emerald is it was and even that multicolored horse in the Merry ol' Land of Oz still looks wonderful. Among other reasons (not to mention, one of the most cleverest twist in disposing of the villain) makes THE WIZARD OF OZ the classic that it was.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"BeatlesFan3287 Reviews ""The Wizard Of Oz""","As incredible as it might seem, phrases like, ""Where not in Kansas anymore"", and ""I'll get you my pretty...and your little dog too!"" were completely unknown 70 years ago. ""The Wizard Of Oz"" set more standards in the industry than just about any other film. If not for this film, ""Dorothy"", ""Toto"", and ""The Cowardly Lion"" would not be house-hold names. If it had never been released, the song, ""Over The Rainbow"" would never had been heard and it certainly wouldn't be one of the most celebrated songs of all time. Had this film not been released, fantasy as a film genre and even film in general would have turned out very different.Judy Garland, in her trademark role, plays Dorothy Gale: a young girl who longs to leave her bleak country life in Kansas for a place that lies ""over the rainbow"". As we all know, Kansas was filmed in sepia tone where as Oz was in Technicolor. This was very experimental at the time and set a stark contrast between the two settings. To this day, film has seen nothing else quite like Oz. An amazing land of colorful flowers and plants, lofty mountains, and cities of emerald. Even more incredible than the land is the people who inhabit it. The diminutive munchkins, The Scarecrow, The Tin Man, The Cowardly Lion, and the wizard himself are just some of the many characters who the public has come to know and love. But even as Dorothy befriends most of them, she comes to realize, is the land of Oz really a substitute for her family back in Kansas? The acting is superb as each actor completely embodies the character he or she plays. Even more so than the acting, the visuals are what has made this film a classic. Every so often you get beautiful shots of Oz and its terrain, which is amazing considering the movie takes place entirely on an indoor set. The CGI of today rarely catches the magnificence of what was done by the set-designers of this production. All of this gives the film a much more organic feel than the often artificial films of today.Many people will point to this film, rather than Gone With The Wind or Citizen Kane, as the defining movie of the Golden Age of Hollywood. And indeed, this film is just as golden as the yellow brick road Dorothy follows to reach her goals. This is a flawless piece of cinema that has set the standard for all fantasy films that have come after it.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Producer Mervyn LeRoy was so financially damaged he swore never to put another cent of his own money in another movie. No adaption of Oz has ever been a hit in it's initial release. The film didn't achieve it's classic status until it was recycled on TV in the 50's (more irony: the vast majority of the first TV audiences viewed it in blazing black & white, taking out much of it's color transforming wallop).

"The Wizard of Oz (1939) - Follow the Yellow Brick Road, Go Over the Rainbow, and You'll Have a Feeling You're Not in Kansas Anymore!","One of the most wonderful and beautiful entertaining family masterpieces is 1939's all-time classic, ""The Wizard of Oz"". Directed by the same director of ""Gone with the Wind"" in the same year, Victor Fleming has helped to bring L. Frank Baum's timeless children's' stories to life on the big screen. The story tells about Dorothy Gale and her dog Toto, who get sent to the land of Oz, after their house in Kansas was sent in a tornado. Along the way, they meet singing munchkins, a scarecrow in need of a brain, a tin man in need of a heart, a lion in need of courage, a beautiful kind witch, flying monkeys, a green nasty witch, and a wonderful wizard of a green city.

The songs never leave your head, and you always want to hum to them. ""The Wizard of Oz"" is a beautiful memory of our childhood, and it brings some heartwarming moments of love, courage, and how home matters.

Dorothy meets some friends (The Scarecrow, The Tin-Man, and The Lion) and they all decide to find the wizard so they can get something that they wish they had (home, brain, heart, courage).  A great film that caters to all audiences.  5 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Colorful classic,"Everybody has heard of the wizard of oz because it is a classic! So of course I had to watch it at some point.In general it is a solid movie, the story is pretty simple but entertaining, the characters are really great and memorable and the music is fabulous. This was meant to be a kids movie and sure it is, but you can watch it as an adult, too because it is so heartwarming.I was also inpressed by the high quality, rarely seen by a novie of the late thirties. The colours look so bright and real, movies that got released years after the wizard of oz cannot compete with that quality.So to sum it up for you: This is a classic. Just watch it, if you like it or not.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Don't forget or underestimate just how technically impressive it is. An incredible achievement in 1939. Still technically impressive in 2022.,"Who hasn't seen the Wizard of Oz? What else is there to be said. Nothing, except that I watched the recently released 4K version on Blu Ray. And what really struck me more so than ever before is just how impressive a piece of work it is. It is not a case of an average film that has a lot of heart that the masses fell in love with. This is an absolutely incredibly made film. Huge lavish sets. Technicolour like that was never seen before. Wonderful performances. Visual effects I can't believe were possible in 1939. So far ahead of its time in terms of scale and technicality and what was being done with the camera at this time. It truly is the perfect film in every way. And another thing I thought about for the first time is that so many films are timeless classics and you think they will never be remade. But then inevitably at some point many years later there comes a time when it does start to show its age in small ways and could benefit from a revitalisation for modern audiences so they do get remade. This is one of those films that you just simply can't imagine being remade. And 83 years later and still Hollywood hasn't dared touch it. Any remake made today would pale in comparison. It could still be many many years before anyone even considers it. This is a remarkable testament to how far ahead of its time and what an accomplishment it truly is.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Over the Rainbow for The Wizard of Oz,"A young girl named Dorthy Gale yearns for a life away from the farm. After she and her dog Toto are swept away by a tornado, Dorthy finds herself an unlikely hero in the land of Oz. But all she can think about is going home. Together with her new friends Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion, she sets off to see the wizard of Oz who may be her only way back to Kansas.What makes a movie timeless? Is it a good script? Superior acting? Brilliant direction? A relatable protagonist? Any number of criteria could be added to this list. Modern movies have all these qualities and are easily forgotten. Even movies that sweep the Oscars will soon find themselves in the $5 bin at Wal-Mart before Christmas. So what makes a movie timeless?Movies that I consider timeless are those which continue to be ""discovered"" by the next generation. Like an adventurer who finds a priceless treasure, so too are we who rediscover the stories worth retelling. Isn't that what our best stories do...asked to be retold? Whether it's a grandfather recounting his yesteryears to a grandchild, or a spooky story around a campfire, or old friends reminiscing about the good old days, the stories that are worth retelling are the one that last forever.Even if you've never seen The Wizard of Oz you can probably quote a large portion of it. That's because it has become ingrained into our culture. I've just left the theater after watching Fathom Event's 85th anniversary screening. As I looked around the theater I saw young people, old people, singles, married couples, different ethnicities, different personalities - all gathered together to experience one of the best stories ever told. If that isn't the definition of timeless then I don't know what is.Prop I Want: The Mayor of Munchkin Land's top hat

The Birthmark of Fantasy Films! The GREATEST Movie Ever Made? Follow The Yellow Brick Road and See!,"From over the rainbow, to a house falling on a witch, The Wizard of Oz was at first viewed by MGM to be a failed project of a film, due to many events delaying its process. OH BOY! They were WRONG! With the director pushing the film to continue its process, due to his daughter wanted to see The Wizard of Oz adapted on the big screen, as it first was a book. So the director pushed for its progress and it would change cinema and Hollywood!From the glamour/whimsical/beauty of the scenes, to the twister, in my opinion the most realistic tornado ever in films and guess what? It was done with a cloth! Go figure! Before the age of computer/CGI effects. Directors would find their own way of making things as REALISTIC as it can be and OH BOY! What a WONDER! While watching Dorothy run and the others. It feels like you're watching a real/deal tornado in the process. As a kid, I even wondered if they had filmed during the process of a real tornado, in the background? Haha.Anyways. Not only this. But the witches castle and when the monkeys are flying are so INCREDIBLE again for its time, The Wizard of Oz was defying gravity and possibilities. That's what makes it STANDOUT even nearly 75+ years later and let's not forget the beautiful/artwork of the scenes, which was filmed on an artistic backdrop on a stage. All the time Hollywood could save money, if only they went back to the original stages, for films. CGI can either be a win or a mess. I think from a CGI perspective, The Gladiator is maybe THE BEST CGI film ever made. Ridley Scott made a MASTERPIECE, with that film. But OH BOY!Peter Jackson's adaptation to The Hobbit 3 was a MESS! The CGI when the war occurs was TRAGIC!Anyways. To conclusion what time and money Hollywood could save if only they went back to the original platform of stages. The Wizard of Oz, no doubt is The GREATEST staged play/fantasy film EVER!With Garland playing Dorothy as sweet and cute as she can. One of the greatest female performances ever in movies and The BIRTHMARK of villains with Margaret Hamilton playing the wicked witch of the west. Margaret gives it her ALL! Creating a revolution for villains in films! Without Margaret playing the wicked witch of the west, would there even be a Darth Vader or a Joker? Let alone. Without The Wizard of Oz would there even be the lure of fantasy films such as Star Wars, Lord of The Rings, The Dark Knight, you name it.The Wizard of Oz laid out and smoothed a yellow brick road for ALL fantasy films!

The film that got me to love the wonderful Judy Garland,"This is the film that got me to love the wonderful Judy Garland and also the OZ book series by Frank L. Baum, on which the film is based, particularly ""The Wonderful Wizard of OZ."" I don't have any particular scene I like because I love this film.The movie begins when 12-year-old Dorothy is walking home from school with her dog, Toto. But Toto had snuck into the yard of the irascible townswoman, Miss Almira Gulch. He then chased Miss Gluch's cat and bit her on the leg. Dorothy was upset that Miss Gulch hit Toto over the back of the head with a rake. But the two ran all the way home unharmed. But whenever Dorothy tries to tell her aunt and uncle, as well as Hickory, Hunk, and Zeke, the farmhands, what happened, they are too busy to listen. Miss Gulch shows up with a sheriff's order and takes Toto away to be... (*glup*) put down. Toto escapes and returns to Dorothy, who is momentarily elated. When she realizes that Miss Gulch will soon return, she decides to take Toto and run away. On their journey, Dorothy encounters a fortune teller named Professor Marvel. He is a kind and lovable man who guesses that Dorothy is running away and feeling unappreciated at home, and he tricks her into believing Aunt Em is ill so that she will return home. As Dorothy leaves, signs of an approaching storm begin to appear. She rushes back to the farm's house just ahead of a sudden tornado. There, she takes shelter inside the house, where she is knocked unconscious by a loose window frame. Then Dorothy dreams that she, her dog Toto, and the farmhouse are transported to the magical Land of Oz. There, the Good Witch of the North, Glinda, advises Dorothy to follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City and meet the Wizard of Oz, who can return her to Kansas. During her journey, she meets a Scarecrow, a Tin Man, and a Cowardly Lion, who join her, hoping to receive what they lack themselves (a brain, a heart, and courage). All of this is done while also trying to avoid the Wicked Witch of the West and her attempt to get the ruby slippers from Dorothy, who received them from Glinda. Of course, the slippers belonged to the Wicked Witch of the East, who was squashed by Dorothy's house.I love four out of all the songs from the film, which are: ""Over the Rainbow,"" ""Ding, Dong,"" ""If I Only Had a Brain,"" and ""The Merry Old Land of Oz."" And I always like it when the Cowardly Lion goes ""R-R-Ruff!"" So overall, I would say this film is excellent for young and old alike.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Timeless Classic,"I watched the Wizard of Oz again today. It's the version that was remastered in 2005 and released on DVD. The transition from sepia to color is amazing. The costumes and sets just pop with color! The movie holds up to repeat viewings because of the top notch acting and heartfelt message. At sixteen years old Judy Garland is already has star power. She sings and acts beyond her years, and she carries the lead role with a gentle touch. The supporting cast are also excellent. Ray Bolger's dancing in particular is a joy to behold. The approaching holidays is the perfect time to watch it, since after all there's no place like home.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Pink Floyd Connection,"OK, now I love this movie just as much as everyone else here, but rather than re-iterate everything that's been said before, I'd like to alert one and all to a rather interesting fact...If you play The Wizard Of OZ with the sound turned right down, but start playing Pink Floyd's 'Dark Side Of The Moon' album at the third lion roar of the MGM symbol just as the movie starts, something really strange happens...I won't tell you any specifics, and you have to wait for a bit, but the link-up between the music and what you're watching on-screen is uncanny. The effect lasts until Dorothy arrives in Oz. N'joy.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

THE GOAT,"TWOO is no doubt one of the most all times classic films of all time. Not only as a film but for esoteric info, TWOO is no doubt the GOAT. This is more of a theory review.About: A lady from Missouri who is sent to the Land of Oz. They must find the almighty Wizard so she can go home back to Missouri.Story: It's like the Matrix, Alice in Wonderland and Inception type movies. A person is sent to an alternate reality via dream or portal which isn't real but it actually is real but it's not that real then it actually was real in an esoteric way. Makes sense to you? Probably not because you are a normie. Anyways...
TWOO had a very engaging story that was worth the watch. So much fun, emotion and the acting was top notch.Dorothy was a naive and lost character who under estimates herself. She was a good lead and was able to engage well with the other characters by using her heart, courage and her brain the 3 things her gang was looking for. She became like a guardian while she was seeking guidance. She may represent that quiet leader who is unsure of themselves.Dog: It's a Worthless Mutt.Robot: He wanted a heart so he can reconnect and connect with others and with a loved one. Robot represents relationships today where everyone is in relationships for the unknown. Love doesn't necessarily exist or their type of love is subjective. Many People don't know why they are in that relationship. At the end of the day that relationship becomes what the Robot became. Species that wanders the world without a destination (heart).The Leo: Needed courage because he was a snowflake. The Leo is a reflection of what people today lack. Leo wanted courage so that he can stop being fearful of everything. Leo felt out of place and had the motivation to find courage rather than give up and settle. Like people today they give up, they act tough but in reality they are very scared. Scared of life, death, people, states of being etc. They tend to take advantage of the vulnerable just to feel secure about their lack of personality.The Stickman: He desired a brain. This may represent lack of skill, education or talent. The stickman lacked self-esteem and only saw what was not there when in fact the Scarecrow was a major factor in the gang getting to the Wizard. Like people today they require validation from people they don't like and people who don't like them. He then is given a diploma aka a false hope. This can be related to many people who get a diploma, degrees etc. And end up not being able to find a job.Witch Vs Fairy: It is said that the Witch was actually good and the Fairy was bad. Who knows? We can only have our theories. Maybe the Witch was trying to prevent devastation and the fairy manipulated Dorothy so that she gain negatively gain from it. Both played a key roles on the yellow brick road. It's unknown what each of their motivations were.The Wizard: Who was just a man in a cave. I mean behind a curtain. He acted like he had power but once the curtains were open you saw he was a weak, unhelpful individual. He gave the gang false hope and they were satisfied when the journey itself should have been an indicator that what they sought for was in them all along.This is a reflection on how people today can be manipulated with paper, rewards and gifts. This shown that people require materialism in order to feel important. After the gang were given their materials that have nothing to do with their problems they all felt 100% better. Really? After that journey they were given hush ""money"" while remaining blind to the fact that the Wizard was nothing but a jobber. He had no power and the gang were fooled by his presents. As for Dorothy I guess what she was given was lets call it insight in how to use her heart, confidence and a solution to get back home. Dorothy's voyage seemed like she was there to lead the 3 for who knows why?Overall, a solid movie that can consist of many theories. TWOO is not just for relaxtainment it's a movie about decoding a hidden message.Production: Obviously this was done on a set and they did a great job during those days. It was beautiful.Highlight: We're off to see the Wizard...The wonderful Wizard of oz.Main Intelligence: 5

"I do believe in spooks...I do, I do, I do...","Iconic, fantastical, loved by millions: The Wizard of Oz should be made compulsory viewing for all under-fives before their minds are polluted by the some of the drivel that passes for children's entertainment these days.

And perhaps that's the appeal of the film for many adults: the magical sense of nostalgia that accompanies every viewing, a reminder of the innocence of childhood before growing up made things complicated, the comfortable feeling that comes from watching an old familiar favourite.If you're the parent of a small child, do them a favour and get this film for them now.

Movie Review: HIST of American Cinema 272,"""The Wizard of Oz"", directed by Victor Fleming, is a classic and all time favorite film for many people. What made this such a great film is the use of imagination and the friendships between the characters. Another amazing thing about this movie was the cinematography. There were lots of great shots with special effects used to highlight the magical moments in the scenes. A lot of the characters had very enthusiastic and vibrant personalities to them which I think makes them more enjoyable and relatable. I also think the way the characters were written had a huge influence on future stories and movies. In most films and television shows, the evil/villain character always has the same type of high pitched evil sounding cackle, and I think this came from the Wicked Witch of The West. Another great aspect of this movie is the way Fleming weaved all the musical numbers throughout the story. I think each song came into place at the right time and nothing seemed out of place.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Timeless Classic. A Film For All Ages. Remember There's No Place Like Home!,"The Wizard Of Oz is by now a cult classic. So many themes and principles are present to name a few there's boredom, escape, exploring new adventures, dreamed fantasies, wicked enemies becoming witches, friendship, journey and discovery and finally learning the true meaning of home and family. This movie has been seen by a billion people many like myself have viewed it a couple hundred times. Many good things can be said about this beloved 1939 classic Oz is simply more than just a movie about a dreamy Kansas farm girl who takes an unforgettable trip down the Yellow Brick Road to a magical fantasy world. This film made Judy Garland(Dorothy) a star, just to mention Garland brought a certain sex appeal to Oz she was one of the most beautiful actresses of her time it was tragic her life ended so young. For some unexplained reason I tend to have sexual thoughts and feelings now every time that I now watch Oz I can particularly relate to my own past intimate relationships with females when viewing Oz, but I now see the trigger factor is the beauty of Judy Garland. Margaret Hamilton is perfectly cast as The Wicked Witch of the West her wicked looks use to give me nightmares as a child when I would view Oz, but as time past and I matured the terror went away. The Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion are all lovable characters hey wouldn't it be great to have friends like that on earth to help guide you on your journey of life. This film became a national institution, thanks to perennial TV airings, the Technicolor brilliance of Oz, and the song ""Over the Rainbow"". Many believe Oz gives a message of a continued journey that travel should be a regular that people should continue to travel and see new lands meet new people and search for answers. I instead take the message of Oz as there's no place like home. I have found this out from my own experiences. The world happens to be a very cold and cruel place as in comparison to home love, comfort, and support which are present. Knowledge can be found at home, and home is where the heart is, and courage is found inside your home. Remember there's no place like home.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

In Oz she is told the only way to get back to Kansas is with the help of a wizard. She ends up meeting an array of friends...and enemies.This movie is directed by Victor Fleming (Gone with the Wind) and stars Judy Garland (A Star is Born), Jack Haley (Vacation in Reno), Frank Morgan (A Stranger in Town), Billie Burke (Topper) and Margaret Hamilton (13 Ghosts).Everything about this movie is magic - the storyline, the sets, the characters, the subplots around the various characters, the settings and the circumstances are all perfect.

10/10,"Judy Garland's portrayal of Dorothy, Dorothy's oddball friend Oz, ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"", and the rest of this beautiful production of ""The Wizard of Oz"" lose little of their magic over the years. While poking fun at this kind of classic, innocent fantasy has become somewhat of a trend in recent years, the film itself has aged well, and will likely retain an appreciative audience for some time to come.Undoubtedly part of the appeal of the story and the characters comes from their being old friends with so many cinema fans, but there's also a good reason why they've endured so long, and have endured even after. Becoming all too familiar. Although Dorothy is not a particularly complex character, she represents an innocent yet deep passion that is easy to identify with. Also, the 'Oz' characters are quirky enough to remain interesting, but there is a core element that is again believable. Who doesn't feel like they could use at least one of the things Dorothy's friends love?The adaptation from the original story was well done, making good choices for characters and episodes to work into the film. The settings and visual effects may not impress devotees of computer imagery today, but in their time they certainly showed great skill and planning, and even today, in their own way they are more believable than most computer tricks that have become overused.The famous story has also been used for several more recent adaptations, and some of them have their own good points.

THE MAN BEHIND THE CURTAIN!,"Thank you Judy Garland and the Wizard, Frank Morgan, for so many memories, then and now.So true, how this classic has held up through the years, and in beautiful color. We all remember it being shown once a year on tv (back in the day when there was NO cable).Everyone has passed, but these incredible artists have left us a true labor of love. The secret, if there really is a secret behind this film's success, is everyone enjoyed each other's company and worked together as a family. You can tell, especially Judy Garland, who in later years said she found it strange to be so afraid of the Wicked Witch, Margaret Hamilton, because she was such a nice lady. That's family.A toss-up as to who outdoes who, Lahr, Bolger or Haley? You be the judge.Nearly every scene a classic, take your pick, a rare statement to be made of any film to this very day.Director Victor Fleming recommended Shirley Temple for the lead, and wouldn't that have been interesting? But only Judy Garland could sing, or was meant to sing, ""Over the Rainbow,"" and a special Oscar to go with it. Ironically, the song was used in the fim noir, I WAKE UP SCREAMING in 1941.

One of the Great Children's Films of All Time,"Many years ago I recall queuing around the block to see the first release of The Wizard of Oz. An experience that is not easily forgotten. It remains for me the best children's film ever made, thanks to Victor Fleming and his marvelous cast. Considering the technology of the cinema back in 1939, it was truly remarkable in many of its effects. There are some magical moments, Judy Garland's heart felt singing of ""Over the Rainbow"" (never equaled by others), and the early monochrome scenes in Kansas with the approaching tornado, the first view of Oz in colour, the Witches feet rolling up under the house, the walk through the enchanted forest and the field of poppies, the initial meetings with the Scarecrow, Tinman, and the Wizard, the Bad Witch melting under the water, and the farewell to Oz. Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch, remains one of the screens most frightening characters. Perhaps the Munchkins are allowed too much screen time, but once Dorothy starts her journey along the yellow brick road, and meets her strange companions, it's a joy to behold. A film that both enchanted and frightened me at a very early age, as indeed did Walt Disney's ""Snow White"" a couple of years earlier. Perhaps many future generations of children will find the thrill of Oz still alive and well in this remarkable production.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Wizard of Oz,"This film 85 years old and it is still a great film. It is a film about simple good hearted souls in the world. The film takes place in Kansas where a good hearted young girl is on a farm that is visited by a evil lady that takes her most prized possession- her dog Toto. The dog runs away from the evil women and then comes and joins her owner again. But the owner realizes that she does not want this to happen again so she then runs away. That is when she starts on her own journey and finds a wizard that gives her a mission, a witch, and several kind hearted animals that just need a little boost and self esteem. This is a good kind spirited movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"This is not Kansas, baby, it's Hollywood!","This is simply the best MGM musical (or at least it ranks with the very best).  The use of technicolor is amazing, the sets are breathtaking and Arlen's music is stunning.  The only drawback this film has is that it has been released in the same year as MGM other giant ""Gone With The Wind.""  A big pity - had it been released before or after it would have won more oscars.  Nevertheless it still will be remembered as the fulfillment of the movie musical.  A must see for everyone who likes movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A childhood memory,"This was one of the earliest movies I remember watching with my mom; I even remember Dorothy being one of my first Halloween costumes. I loved how the movie starts off in black and white and turns into vibrant colors once Dorothy is asleep, which allows the viewer to put a clear distinction between Dorothy's real life and her subconscious, even invoking a feeling of sadness that to Dorothy, her life seemed dull and in need of life. The part I loved the most was that Dorothy befriended the characters of Oz, despite some of them not showing her kindness initially. Dorothy was the true light in her dark world, and it's bittersweet to see the realization of her true worth once she wakes up. This movie will forever live in the fondest part of heart. A true classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Magic in the making!,"I first saw this film when my grandmother bought me the 50th anniversary addition of when i was too young to recall my own age. I grew up watching this film on an almost daily basis until i was at least 10 years old. i never got tired of it and i always found it inspiring to a boy who needed to be inspired like me at that time. this films magical portrayal of the inner child in all of us brought out of the best in me at that time. knowing full well how your friends can make a difference for you. and not to mention that most this film has a message for more than just children...but for the young in heart in all of us.In the opinion of most no film has yet to capture the imagination like this film, and no film has yet to exceed the wonderful affect this film and most of all the story itself have had on people for the last century. From the moment it hit the screen it took a while to sink in to the public imagination... and it took a while to sink into my imagination the messages this movie held so dear. Well I hold this film dear to me for it has helped so many children find at least a small sense of that incredible adventure we all seek at that age. if you haven't seen this movie I recommend you do. As this film has done since its release it has captured imagination... of both the young and . so take the time and sit down to watch it. you may find that your still young in heart even if your not young.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Wizard of Oz,"In 1939 the fantasy film and children's story book came to the silver screens. This had been a huge Hollywood California Production. Filmed as a very productive project and very economical and time consuming. The movie was done in both color and sepia and black and white. There where farm animal's like 🐎 horses, 🐐 goat's, 🐄 cow's, and 🐖 pig's, and a 🐕 dog.The story The wizard of oz follows a preteen who falls a sleep in a coma and is wisk far away to another world some place she has never been away from her family who raised her.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
ONE OF THE BEST ADAPTATIONS!!!!,"Magical and fun, a feel good whimsical story that can enchant your kids even today!!!! A really good musical led by a buoyant Judy Garland.The Wizard of OZ is a story about Dorothy who one day gets blown away by a tornado into the magical land of Oz, a land full of magical unique beings, like a princess, a witch, a talking cowardly lion, a tin man and so on...The songs are beautiful and appropriately used, Judy Garland as Dorothy is perhaps one of the best castings Hollywood may have made.She beautifully encompasses the wonder and innocence of a child, the fear of being amongst strangers, but having the strength to do whats right and being brave and bold enough to carry it out.She is a compassionate and loving girl who encourages her new companions that she meets along the way to step up for themselves when the time is right.Without any violence and without encouraging any malice or hatred, she goes up against the evil witch, with no overpowering abilities or help only her own intelligence and wits and courage. We cry with her , fear for her , cheer for her and are along every step of the journey she undertakes.The finale reveal is silly and whimsical and perfect!!Simply put The Wizard of OZ is a great reminder of what films can do,
they can entrap you in a new world, feel for characters that are fictious,
cry and laugh with them as they take new steps forward in their journey , and wish and perhaps even try to embody some of their great characteristics into ourselves!!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
There's always a pathway home.,"What can one say about The Wizard of Oz that hasn't already been said? It's a perfect fantasy film. Kids love it and you never really outgrow the wonder of it. 'There's no place like home' may be an overworked cliche but it's true nonetheless. The transition from sepia to technicolor still works a treat and is a seamless transition from reality to dream and back again. Okay, Judy Garland was a little old for the role at seventeen but her talent is phenomenal and she will always be Dorothy Gale.Whether it's brains you need, or a heart, or courage, whatever you lack can be yours if you just follow that yellow brick road to self discovery and find that the thing you desired was inside of you all the time. The songs are perfect and it's one delightful sequence after another each one carrying you along like few other films of its type. When Dorothy has to say goodbye to her travelling companions, you'll wipe away a tear, but on going home she finds she hasn't lost them after all. One reason for the film's enduring popularity is that it takes children's fears seriously while at the same time reassuring them that there are people who love them and have built a safe place around them. Wicked witches and flying monkeys notwithstanding, there's always a pathway home.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Magical!,"Watching this film feels like a dream with certain scenes, Emerald City, Muchkin Land, Kansas. Somewhere Over the Rainbow is beautiful in Judy's very capable hands. A lot has been said about the casting, Shirley Temple wanted the role but her voice was not as strong, Deanna Durbin would have given us an operatic version of Somewhere Over The Rainbow and I'm not sure it would have aged as well. I would like to read the books as the only thing I really know that's different is that the shoes were silver and not ruby red like in the movie. Glenda is amazing, Scarecrow, Tinman and Cowardly Lion are perfectly cast although I would say Cowardly Lions costume is not as great as Tin Man and Scarecrow's costume. I mentioned Shirley earlier and years later when she had a show she did perform an Oz story. Watch this film and experience the magic!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Love, Heart, and Courage","It may be pointless to try to add to comments on one of those rare films that transcends virtually all others. I've been told that the audiences gasped when Dorothy walks out of the house and everything is in color. It is a transition to a magic place, made possible by cinematography. Growing up, we got one chance a year to see this. It became the highlight of an evening. It was usually on a Sunday night. The individual characterizations and incredible songs are the stuff that dreams are made of. I'm especially fond of Jack Haley's Tin Man. When he sings his song and then pounds his chest, finally releasing steam from his hat (a funnel) it's amazing. Those flying monkeys haunted me for years. Someone had a nightmare some time before dreaming those guys up. The amazing thing is that there is hardly a person who couldn't sit down and run through the plot of this. Some of my friends who grew up with kind of a harsh view of life, have no problem watching this. if you've been on Mars for the last 55 years, I hope one of your first tasks upon return to earth is to watch this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

its perfect!,"I rewatched this recently and, even though it was made in 1939, it still holds magic. The acting is impeccable for the year it was made and the comedic parts are amazing.The scarecrow, who we meet first, is a legendary character and my personal favourite. He's funny, kind and handsome.The tin man is also pretty funny and I love how much they all care for Dorothy.The lion, the cowardly lion, is hilarious. His amazing line 'put em up' still holds a place in my memory and I quote it regularly haha. His bow is adorable too!Dorothy, Judy Garland, went through so much at such a young age. She deserved the world but it was sadly taken from her when she was so young. Her acting in the Wizard of Oz is excellent but knowing what she went through makes it quite sad to watch.This movie was and still is one of my favourite classics!

Classic that aged very well!,"I don't know what is the main genre for this movie: musical, family or fantasy movie. It has a bit of everything and succeeds in every aspect. Yes the story is simple and there isn't that much action but I don't think a movie needs to be scary or have violence to be entertaining. Despite being made pre World War II this movie is magical. What makes the movie really enjoyable are its colorful characters who take you onto a journey with catchy songs. Although Judy Garland was story-wise too old to play Dorothy, I don't think anyone else could have done it better here. Her song ""Somewhere over the rainbow"" is still a very recognizable and loved song today. That this movie still stands strong without CGI or expensive decor is an amazing feat. Maybe not a movie I would watch that often but when I do I will love every minute of it.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Timeless Classic!,"I've been a huge fan of this film since i was 5 years old. I watched it every year on TV with the family, and at the end of every viewing, couldn't wait until the next year to see it again. As i got older, i started buying a copy for whatever format was hot at the time, VHS, Video CD, DVD, onto Bluray. Now as a fan of 3D, i love new releases being filmed in native 3D,but was never a fan of the idea of converting classics into 3D. When i heard The Wizard of Oz was being converted, i about fell over. How could they do this!!!? Well, it happened, and i resisted. That is until i saw the Bestbuy Metalpak. I purchased it solely for the 2D copy and the Metalpak. After a couple months of staring at that Metalpak sitting with all my other Steelbooks and Metalpaks, i decided i had to have a look for myself. So, i watched The Wizard of Oz in 3D, and was blown out of my mind. Even the best conversions out there have several instances of ghosting or other 3D anomalies. NOT THIS RELEASE! This 3D conversion is absolutely perfect. The depth is perfectly deep throughout, and there's no foolishly implemented gimmick shots of things protruding from the screen where they shouldn't be. Even the coloring, which tends to fade in 3D, was bright and popping. This 3D presentation is simply perfect, and any serious Oz fan owes it to themselves to give this a go, you won't be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
THE film classic,"No matter who you talk to, chances are they have at least heard of this movie or the play that it was adapted from. This was one of the most successful movies of the decade especially due to its elaborate sets and costumes, which were very convincing for the year it was made. This was also Judy Garland's first major film, and it caught many producer's attentions to get her more work and cement her as one of the greatest actresses/singers of the 20th century.The movie focuses on a girl who wants to escape her life, and she ends up in the magical world of Oz. She is on a journey to find a way back home and meets some very lovable characters on the way. The makeup, costumes, sets, effects and Technicolor/sepia usage make this one of the most unique films in history, and it was very advanced for its time. It is by far one of my favorite movies, and I love it to no end. It's one of those films that you look back on and can't really think of your life had you never seen it.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Prime example of movie magic.,"The Wizard of Oz is one of those movies whose appeal to all ages hasn't withered away with time. The beautiful set-pieces, the loveable characters and their journey through the magical world of Oz is still as immersive and captivating as ever.Both our main character, Dorothy, and her wonderful friends in Oz are so brilliantly acted that you might call them the definitive version of their respective character. This may be a part of the reason why every attempt at a sequel or a re-imagining of the story either fails or gets a lukewarm reception, because with this movie held in such high praise, you have a lot to live up to.But I am one of the people who will defend the underrated Return to Oz (1985). Check it out if you haven't, because even though its tone is far darker it also did a magnificent job in the special effects department just like this timeless masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Colorful Wonderland,"Imagination and fantasy to me is always one of the most crucial things to have in life because whenever we retreat everyday to whatever world we construct in our minds we fuel hope and belief that there really is more beyond where we are currently residing, but also become more than what we are.This is one of my favorite fantasy films of all time, which is no surprise. I saw this film when I was about 7 years old, I really got into it because I love fantasy I really loved the Fairy Tales my mom read to me. I loved the film then and as an adult I still love watching it today, it just has so much going for it and not just was it a prime example of a fantasy film done right but also how we all saw film in general.The production value is just fantastic even to this day it's just a feast for the eyes, from the use of mat painting which really gave the illusion of a broad land. Though it's true in some scenes you can easily tell it's a painting in the background but that didn't deter the film for me, in fact it just added to the value of the film making this film beautiful mix of the theatrical and film. Let alone I'd prefer mat painting most of the time over a CGI background anytime where with them even a grade schooler can tell the CGI is fake. The mat background is just beautiful, it's like certain pieces you can put up in an art gallery, from the hills to the emerald city. I really love the use of color, this film has more color than a craola crayon box or the film ""Sin City"" it not just helps bring out this fantasy realm but also feels like Dorothy has walked right into a painting, from the flowers, the ground, munchkin land just everything you just must see to believe.The music is just great there are so many memorable songs that are just timeless classics. From ""We off to see the Wizard"" which is always a fun song. I even like the songs of both the ""Scarecrow"" and ""Tin Man"" singing about what they lack in life. But of course, no surprise my favorite song is ""Somewhere over the Rainbow"" it is just a beautiful song, it's one of my favorite songs of all time because it is so hopeful and optimistic. It's one not just about one's desire and wonder about going far away and finding something more and better in life but just simply about the dreams we all constantly hold to get us through a troubled existence.The humor is great and hits at the right moments. One of my favorite humors scenes has been the one with the talking apple trees that complained about their apples being picked. That always cracked me up because of how absurd it truly is.Character are great from the fabulous trio, The Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion each of them have unique persona and great moments, it's fun when we see them all together and play off of each other much like ""The Three Stooges"" well kind of but at least with they have something to strive for which makes them easy to emphasize with and want to win because that's something we all do throughout our lives.The Wicked Witch of the West is a villain played well by Margaret Hamilton, she's a villain you love to hate whom is kind of scary but funny at the same time. It's basically the Wicked Witch archetype but what makes her stand out is in her lines and delivery of them, let alone character whom is just a vanity obsessed jerk that is just tormenting people for no good reason or sick amusement and is obsessed with getting those red slippers just to get more power. Though to me it wasn't so much her that scared me as a kid it was really her minions the flying monkeys, they were just brutes let alone so darn many of them I was afraid they would fly down snatch me away or beat the crap out of me, in one scene they dismembered the scarecrow that's how bad they are.But to me the true heart and soul of the film and story is the character Dorothy Gale whom is my favorite character. Judy Garland is just fantastic this is still my favorite role from her, she is Dorothy Gale just as Christopher Reeve is Superman and any other actor and actress that just fit like a glove for their role. Yeah there have been many other live action versions over the years but she is still the best one in my book. This was also Judy's debut in a main role which in turn helped launch her to stardom, and rightfully so, she really gave it everything she had and delivered. I really love how she has that every day person vibe to her, I thought she was inside and out, it's no surprise I did have a crush on her as a kid.I really love the emotionality on her whenever she expressed sadness it really looked and felt genuine. You really emphasize or can relate to her in some way or another. The fact that she feels she's not where she belongs and dreams of going someplace far and having a better life or at least something more which is understandable I've always felt that way ever since I was a child. I even like that she's open minded and keeps optimistic, hopeful and a positive attitude even in the most difficult circumstances.Other than being a fun adventure, this film does have deep substance a lot of things from the coming of age theme. The Dorothy character is a young teen that is near the verge of young adult hood which is always a time where were thinking about being and entering the adulthood world in some way or form. Dorothy throughout the adventure very much acts like an adult but maintains her innocence which makes her strong not just from getting though circumstances that are difficult or at least look that way at first but the fact she stays true to herself.Which is part of the other theme which is about building identity, each of the three characters The Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion all represent personality aspects. They all think they lack something but have always had it all this time, throughout their journey they exercise those aspects. From the Lion whom has as much nervous and frightful energy than Shaggy and Scooby Doo, but he goes on and does the right thing despite what he feels which to me is what true courage really is, and they do say it's only when we feel some fear is when courage comes. And the Scarecrow whom really is exercising smarts from tricking the talking trees into throwing their apples and a plan to infiltrate the castle. But also, it's one Dorothy where throughout the journey she has stayed true to herself which is part of building identity to remember who we are as new things come along in life.But also, what home really is, throughout the journey Dorothy is trying to find her way back home but the thing is even though the beautiful world of Oz isn't her home not is Kansas. She's really thinking about all the people that she left behind in Kansas and how much she is beginning to miss them. And that is truly what home is as an old saying goes ""it's not the place it's the people"". Both Kansas and Oz are her home because there are people in both realms that love her.As long as we keep dreaming, home is never far away.Rating: 4 stars",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Must-Watch Timeless Classic!,"""The Wizard of Oz"" is a revolutionary movie about a young girl named, Dorothy, and her journey to go home after being swept away by a twister to the magical world of Oz. On her journey home she becomes friends with a brainless scarecrow, a heartless tin man, and a cowardly lion, as they go with her to find the magical Wizard of Oz. This movie is a timeless classic for a few very big reasons. The first being the style of the movie, second the characters, and third the simple yet fun plot.The style of this movie is what really stands out to me because of its bright vibrant colors for the fun and nice places and the dark eerie sets for the bad and evil places. The set design is very impressive especially for its time, however I think that the costume design and make-up are even better. This movie has fantastic make-up and costumes especially for its time. The make-up may be a little messy sometimes, however when you put into perspective the time that this movie was made it becomes so much more impressive.The characters in the movie are incredibly important, because you follows them throughout their journey and watch them grow and I think that is also another great aspect of this movie. This movie is special in a way that it shows these characters grow without having to make them go through a huge tragedy or something grand to make them grow. Instead these characters all grow by just being themselves more and by really bringing out who they really are.The simplicity of the plot and the fun journey that this movie takes you on definitely draws in many people as well. I find this movie to be incredibly fun, because it is a very simple journey as most of what this movie is, is you feeling the magic of Oz with all of the creatures that the filmmakers and writers create as well as the great atmosphere that the movie has.I think this movie is a very fun journey that is definitely worth watching. The movie has a very fun and simple plot that I enjoyed following. The story was not only simple, but also the characters are very simple and easy to love. The set is so beautiful that it almost takes your eyes away from the actors and the story at points. The growth of the characters, the simplicity of the plot and the incredible set is what makes this movie one of the greats and it definitely should be. I love ""The Wizard of Oz"" and I think everyone should at least watch the movie once in his or her life.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An Aging True Classic,"Even as time passes by and the film ages, and nearing the 100th year anniversary sooner than we realize, The Wizard of Oz has stood the test of time and has become a true timeless classic that generations of families have enjoyed. I don't believe any other film of the period has been enjoyed by so many people, and across so many generations and in so many different countries and languages. I remember waiting for The Wizard of Oz to be on television every year; before DVD and before home video was cheap enough for everyone to own their own copy, it was a treat to see this on television. It was like Christmas.Over the years, other studios have tried to emulate the success of the 1939 film with their own versions and stories of Oz, but usually not to the same outcome. None have ever been as popular as what we refer to the original, but the 1939 version wasn't the first time that Oz was brought to the screen, it had been put to film several times over the years, as early as 1903. The 1939 MGM version and the fact that it was able to be filmed in color and with sound was a huge achievement and made a big difference, so much that MGM even changed the color of the slippers in the book from silver to Ruby because of Technicolor.To say that The Wizard of Oz has made an impact on the world is an understatement, this film still gets discussed, it gets referenced in modern pop culture, especially by The Simpsons and Family Guy; and it's still popular enough that new versions and spin-offs are still being released almost 100 years later. Even the Muppets did their own versions of Oz at one point, as did Michael Jackson. It has even had 2 sequels released by Walt Disney Pictures, Return to Oz in 1985 and Oz the Great and Powerful in 2013. The Wizard of Oz will probably be best remembered though for Judy Garland and the song Over the Rainbow, two of the most iconic parts of the film.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

With all the sequels and reboots, I think it's great that this movie has remained a timeless classic for the ages.

A landmark in film history,"Dorothy Gale is a young girl who lives on a farm in Kansas, but a tornado drag her to a magical land where she will have to go through various adventures in order to return. Directed by a team led by Victor Fleming, this movie has script by Noel Langley, Florence Ryerson, Edgar Allan Woolf and others. The cast is headed by Judy Garland and Frank Morgan.We are facing one of the most famous films of all time, the precursor of musical, fantasy and adventure films. And its no coincidence that many of its scenes were in collective memory. It was a milestone for cinema, and almost all saw it, in movies, television, DVD or any other. The script is very interesting and takes children and adults to the child's imagination, plenty of witches, fairies, beautiful and impossible things. There are no dead moments, everything is perfect. The editing of the film was made carefully and photography, with a striking contrast between scenes in vivid colors and sepia scenes, marked the ""border"" between our world and the magical world of Oz. All this was innovative for its time.The characters in this film have become iconic. The Scarecrow, the Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion have become paradigms of the potential untapped of human beings, people who seek to overcome their own insecurities and flaws. Dorothy has been an ideal of goodness and virtue, and her puppy an example of loyalty. In turn, the wizard ends up making the connection between the two worlds. Garland had it so good in this film that just famous and was one of the most acclaimed actresses of the golden age of American cinema.The film also has several special effects, rudimentary and limited to existing technical, but functional and effective. The soundtrack of the film is perhaps one of the most remembered today. It mainly composed by Harold Arlen and has filled the movie with delightful musical moments. One of them, ""Over the Rainbow,"" earned the Oscar for Best Original Song and its an icon even today. The film has also won the statuette for Best Soundtrack and was nominated for the categories of Best Film (1940), Best Color Cinematography, Best Art Direction and Best Special Effects.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It was not until I saw ""The Wizard of Oz"" for the first time that I consciously noticed B&W versus color, as Dorothy was blown out of Kansas and into Oz. The switch from black and white to color would have had a special resonance in 1939, when the movie was made. Almost all films were still being made in black and white, and the cumbersome new color cameras came with a ""Technicolor consultant"" from the factory, who stood next to the cinematographer and officiously suggested higher light levels. There were cast changes, too; after Buddy Ebsen, as the Tin Man, had an allergic reaction to the silvery makeup, he was replaced by Jack Haley. Musical numbers were recorded and never used. Margaret Hamilton (the Wicked Witch of the West) was seriously burned when she went up in a puff of smoke. Even Toto was out of commission for two weeks after being stepped on by a crewmember. This deep universal appeal explains why so many different people from many backgrounds have a compartment of their memory reserved for ""The Wizard of Oz."" Salman Rushdie, growing up in Bombay, remembers that seeing the film at 10 ""made a writer of me."" Terry McMillan, as an African-American child in northern Michigan, ""completely identified when no one had time to listen to Dorothy."" Rushdie wrote that the film's ""driving force is the inadequacy of adults, even of good adults, and how the weakness of grownups forces children to take control of their own destinies."" McMillan learned about courage, about ""being afraid but doing whatever it was you set out to do anyway."" The Wizard sends them on a mission to get the Wicked Witch's broom, and it is not insignificant that the key to Dorothy's return to Kansas is the pair of ruby slippers. Grownup shoes.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Sentimental Film Experience,"Like many here in the U. S. I grew up watching The Wizard of Oz every year, and every year I enjoyed it immensely. The sets, the music, the story of running away to a far off land somewhere over the rainbow held genuine and deep appeal. Unlike many kids, I was never actually that scared of the flying monkeys, nor did I think the Munchkins were that odd, they were just well dressed little people to me. Oz always seemed so great that I couldn't help but wonder why Dorothy wanted to go back home so badly. Oh well, she did and that was really the engine to propel this story. As an adult it's difficult to separate my history with the film but I will say that the 'lesson' of finding happiness where you started isn't really such a solid outlook to base your life or life decisions on. Nevertheless, I still enjoy The Wizard of Oz.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Forever and Always a Favorite,"I hadn't sat down and watched this movie from beginning to end for several years. After watching it so many times as a kid I think I could replay it in my head with my eyes closed. I call this movie my favorite movie of all time, and I very strongly dislike musicals. But anyway I had the option of watching this film for a cinema history class I am taking and I realized I couldn't remember the last time I sat down and watched it, so I did. 
This movie still has everything. A beautiful soundtrack and score, great acting and singing. It's so well done and nearly everything this movie does still holds up pretty well today. Sure you can tell leaves are plastic, or where the backdrops begin, but the backdrops are beautiful! And the plants are laid out with great detail so as to seem like Dorothy and her friends are really in a poppy field, or a cornfield. This movie is so well rounded with its attention to detail. Every stage of their journey has a unique and identifiable look to it. The costumes are so fabulous and ornate. The Cowardly Lion has always been my favorite character and I love his outfit and his physicality in the role, leaping about on the rocks in the jungle and his wagging tail. It's no wonder this movie has stood the test of time.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Some people without brains do an awful lot of talking, don't they?","Revisiting movies you watched at the young age is always a little bit tough because you understand that you are not a kid anymore and not everything you liked back then you will love now; sure, a sense of nostalgia can help but I think it's better to leave your heart wide open, keep your head in the clouds and just dream on the way you used to.1939's ""The wizard of Oz"" is one of the greatest musicals of all times and the most wonderful stories ever told. The adventures of Dorothy, Scarecrow, Tin Man, Lion and Toto is the story of a true friendship because only real friends despite all of their differences can stick together and help each other out when it comes to a serious problem.When you watch the movie you can't escape the feeling of a fairytale being told to you before you go to bed when you were a child; just like a dream it is so colorful and bright, the villain is bad and the magic is real but home, although boring, full of routines and troubles and in black and white colors, is just as real and there's no place that you would rather be.Fantastic set pieces and decorations, jaw-dropping art design, unbelievably catchy songs, well choreographed dance numbers, outstanding makeup work, a little outdated but nonetheless stunning visual effects and superb performances by all of the lead actors headed by Judy Garland, just 17 years old at the time, turn this story into an immortal work of art and one of cinema's finest examples. Although nominated for six Oscars it was hard to compete that year with the titanic ""Gone with the wind"", also directed mostly by Victor Fleming, but at least it earned the Best Score and the Best Song with ""Somewhere over the rainbow"" which is just as legendary as ""The wizard of Oz"" and is among the songs closest to my heart.It never fails to amaze me how much better and kinder the cinema used to be back in the days but every once in a while (or even more often) you just have to experience that feeling like you're not in Kansas anymore.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Wonderful ""Wizard of Oz""","Still one of the best children's fantasy adventure films ever - with songs! The use of colour in a film has never been surpassed in my view, making the contrast from dusty, grey Kansas to perfect, day-glo Oz all the more telling, and making you realise what an inspired cinematic idea it was! The point has been well made before, but you do have to wonder why Dorothy would ever want to leave the fairy-tale world, until you consider the moral point of the movie which is to celebrate family and home life, even if the grass is literally greener on the other side.The special effects are remarkable for the time, from the devastation of the tornado, the monumental city of Oz and even the comings and goings of Glinda the good witch. Probably the only sub-standard scenes of this type are those of the wicked witch flying on her broomstick, but perhaps I'm being too post-modern in my judgement. The characterisations are mostly delightful, my only carps being that Glinda is just too glutinous to be true, plus I never really cared much for the Munchkins..Outstanding in the cast naturally is Judy Garland as Dorothy, displaying childish insecurity on the one hand but feisty perseverance on the other. She interacts beautifully and naturally with her three new friends and even Toto! The songs are unforgettable too, ""Over The Rainbow"" and ""We're Off To See The Wizard"" especially being songs for the ages .I've seen the film many times, naturally, but it's still a remarkable feat of artistic creativity and to mind hasn't been matched never mind surpassed by any number of real-life Disney or Pixar films since.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Just Follow The Yellow Brick Road,"The Wizard Of Oz (TWOO) is probably one of the most famous Hollywood films of the late-1930s and, maybe, even the early-1940s.As I understand it, when TWOO was first released back in 1939 it really wasn't a colossal hit. It wasn't until the coming of TV when it was first aired in the 1950s that it attracted a humongous fan-base and from there it became one of the most popular films of all-time.Filmed at MGM Studios, TWOO was made at a time when MGM was, without question, the wealthiest, most impressive, and most successful Hollywood studio in the USA.Back in 1939 TWOO was made simply as a showpiece. This was MGM showing the world just how much power they wielded, that they could make an expensive film like this one and not care, one bit, whether it earned them a profit, or not.Little did the MGM big-wigs realize at the time that TWOO would go on to become one of the most beloved Fantasy/Adventure films of all time.So - ""Tap your heels together 3 times and repeat after me - There's no place like home.

Over The Rainbow,"In the late 1930s, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's studio head Louis B. Mayer had a serious conversation with some of his employees. Mayer wanted MGM to make a fantasy film in the style of Walt Disney's hugely successful ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" from the previous year. After some thought, producer Mervyn LeRoy suggested that L. Frank Baum's book ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" could be adapted into a movie. After all, Baum's work was considered an American classic.At that time most films were made in black and white. Working in color meant you had to use a whole new type of camera - and they were big and cumbersome. In addition, MGM was forced to accept a so-called ""Technicolor consultant"" from the camera manufacturer. A man who stood next to the cinematographer and told him how to light every scene. Mayer didn't care, though. He wanted to compete with Disney's pioneering feature. And ""Snow White"" was in color.""The Wizard of Oz"" was made exclusively at the MGM Studios in Culver City. But it was a messy production. The first director was fired after 12 days. Victor Fleming took over, but he was moved to ""Gone with the Wind"". So, it was up to King Vidor to finish the film. And there were cast changes, too. The Tin Man had an allergic reaction to the silvery makeup and had to be replaced. The Wicked Witch was severely burned when she went up in a puff of smoke. Even Toto (the dog) was out of commission for a week after being stepped on by a crew member.The film had its world premiere at Grauman's Chinese Theater in Hollywood. Judy Garland then went on an East Coast publicity tour, which included the New York opening of ""Oz"". But it didn't help. ""The Wizard of Oz"" had been so expensive to produce that MGM made a net loss of millions. The studio didn't get their money back until 1949, when the movie had its re-release worldwide. The following year, MGM sold the rights to TV, where the film has been shown ever since.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Welcome to the land of Fantasy,"It was 1939, when ""Gone with the Wind"" took the major awards of Oscar. But, that's another movie that also made a history of the cinema, yes, this movie. Full of fantasy, that very surprising in its era. I haven't watch ""Gone with the Wind"" yet, but this movie just make me believe the magic of 1939. I think the revolution of the movie and also new standard of the film-idea itself. There are no border in the movie, you can make a world whatever you want, that's what ""The Wizard of Oz"" tried to make.Land of fantasy, a very new field of the cinematography that time. I think the audience will understand that movie isn't just a imagination of usual activities or world, but sometimes as an interpretation of fantasy imagination itself. With the fun song and simple story line, ""The Wizard of Oz"" will last forever, as an old-classic-movie for every children in every era.There were some not optimal scene, but that's okay.

"This is quite simply, one of the greatest family films in all of cinema. How does it hold up today?","""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939), every time I watch this movie, I feel like a child again, which is the sign of a timeless film. This movie is so good, that it has managed to find a place on my top 10 all-time favorite family films list. It has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and also a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. The storyline is, a girl from Kansas named Dorothy ends up in a tornado and eventually winds up knocked out. During that time, she dreams that she's in a mythical land called Oz and must find a way to get home. From there, it's non-stop fun and adventure as Dorothy and her newfound friends set off to find the wizard who could possibly help her find a way back home. Now, at first glance, the plot doesn't really sound like it's that big and engaging. However, the story is written so brilliantly that it keeps you fully invested and having fun all the way from beginning to end. I won't say anything else about the plot at the risk of spoiling it for those who might not have seen it yet. But, let me say this, the plot line is exciting, fun and it also has a few dramatic scenes as well. Those elements are what really carry this film to the next level and equate to a perfect family movie! As far as the acting goes, it's nothing short of sublime from all of the actors and actresses. Every single cast member nails their respectable character flawlessly. But, the two shining stars are Judy Garland as Dorothy and Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch of the West. Those are two of the best performances you will ever see in any family film. Judy Garland does a phenomenal job as Dorothy and Margaret Hamilton is stellar as the Wicked Witch of the West. Their character portrayals make this movie all the more stronger. The rest of the cast is just as brilliant! Remember, a supporting cast is only as good as it's main cast. Every character stands out no matter how long they are on-screen. All of the sets/locations are perfect and really give this film a stunning atmosphere. As far as the special effects go, all of them are outstanding. They do get a little dated at times, but overall, the special effects still hold up today. Fun fact, this is one of the first full-length movies to be filmed in color. Back in the 1930's, film was expensive as you can probably imagine, especially color film. It was a risk to make the majority of this movie in full color. But, at the end of the day, it was a gamble that definitely paid off. Every time Dorothy enters the land of Oz, I always get chills as it transitions from black and white to color. Imagine the audience's reaction in the theater back then! Finally, the soundtrack is perfect and it sets the perfect tone for the story. Kudos to songwriters Harold Arlen and Herbert Stothart. Your film score is phenomenal, it helps bring it to life and it gives this movie it's own unique identity! ""The Wizard of Oz"" is one of the greatest family films of all-time, as it should be. To this day, it still holds up perfectly and is a timeless masterpiece. Seriously, what else can I say about it that hasn't been said already? Another thing, this movie is based on the book, ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" written by L. Frank Baum. I have read the book before, it's very well-written and enjoyable. However, this film does the original book justice and then some. This is an example of where the movie is better than the book itself. I'm giving this film 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. To end my review, let's have a moment of silence for the cast of this film, as all of them have passed away. They may be gone today, but their legacy, including what they left behind in this movie will last forever. If you haven't seen ""The Wizard of Oz"", go see it today, especially if you have children. I guarantee that your kids will love it just as much as you and everybody else who has seen it at some point. Regardless of your age, this film should be on everyone's must-see list. Go watch it as soon as possible, or the Wicked Witch of the West will haunt you in your dreams!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the most memorable journey and musical numbers,"This movie is a notorious classic and I finally got the chance to see it. Although the main reason is because ""Oz The Great and Power"" came out which I am sorta ashamed of. For a movie that came out in 1939 this is a great accomplishment. The musical numbers really stand out and even when the movie is over some of the tunes, actually just about all of the tunes was stuck in my head. The musical numbers all just really stick and although the adventure is simple it's memorable. Some of the virtues and morals in this movie can be questionable to some, but it's well blended into the story. In fact the musical numbers and the journey in this is more memorable than ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"". Especially since it has musical numbers like ""Over the Rainbow"". There is a reason why just about everyone has at least heard of or somewhat know about ""The Wizard of Oz"". This is a fantastic musical journey that I highly recommend.8.3/10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The musical milestone,"Delightful to watch, Fleming and others did a wonderful job in directing this film. It was well developed, and the characters were fun and interactive with each other. I am very much a fan of musicals and think that this is one of the best ones I have seen. The make-up was phenomenal for all the characters, but I did think that the cowardly lion's make-up was a little creepy. Although I do give them props for how well it was considering the time period. Judy Garland was the perfect Dorothy and I loved the character and how they chose to express her.The switch from black and white to color and then back was a very smooth one and I think brought a nice touch to the film. It really made the land of Oz stand out from the ordinary land. I also think the film touched up on some very good topics and teachings for the young. At the end I did tear up a little, because I know that there is no place like home, but I have found that your home can change as your life progresses. Overall, fantastic film and I think, considering it is a classic and I love musicals, I have to give this film a 10/10. Definitely Recommend!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

My favorite musical of all time.,What a classic! THE WIZARD OF OZ brings back so many memories of when my parents first showed me this beautiful movie and it was great to re-watch it again after a few years. A beautiful movie that starts off perfectly in black and white and then transforms to color as we enter the magical land of oz. The colors are so vibrant and the sounds and musically flow beautifully within this musical and are also extremely catchy as well. The comedic characters such as the scarecrow and Tin-man are hilarious as well. Watching such iconic films for the second or third time such as this one are always so much fun because you know you're going to be able to just sit down and watch a great film and can maybe try and catch those details that you maybe missed the last time you watched it. Those details that act as the foundation for these movies such as the intricate lighting and beautiful colors.

An Essential Film in American History,"Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland) is swept away to a magical land in a tornado and embarks on a quest to see the Wizard (Frank Morgan) who can help her return home.I should probably give the film a 10, but I always find it hard to give anything 100%, because surely it could always be better in some way. Right? But ""Wizard of Oz"" is about as perfect as films get, with such a memorable plot and songs that it has inspired children (and adults) for 80 years. Now, with the ""Wicked"" books (and musical), it seems relevant again, even if those books are not canon.What I find interesting is how simple some of the film is. The sets are very much stage sets and make no serious attempt at being ""real"". But they don't need to be. On the other hand, the makeup is amazing, the costumes beyond compare... and the flying monkeys are almost too lifelike!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Great movie that takes us to our childhood..,"Most of us remember seeing the film at an early age on television, when the bleak black and white of Kansas is magically transformed into the rainbow colors of the Land of Oz. The special effects were by Arnold Gillespie, and to this day the horse of a different color that switches from purple to red to yellow is an inspiration to young audiences. For a film shot on MGM sound stages, the picture has amazing depth, and this is thanks to George Gibson's painted backdrops with blue mountains and white peaks that evoked the aura of the Emerald City.This is pure escapism and Dorothy (Judy Garland) literally escapes from Kansas to take her journey to see the Wizard. In the journey she meets a few friends. These friends are the Wizard of Oz played by Frank Morgan, the Scarecrow played by Ray Bolger, the Cowardly lion played by Bert Lehr, the tin man played by Jack Haley, and the princess played by Billie Burke. Everyone could always enjoy a nice story that takes them on a crazy ride through fantasy world and then snaps back to the real world at the end. The appeal of the film may have something to do with the fact that it symbolizes Dorothy's last childhood experience and it is her loss of innocence that is portrayed. At the end of the movie, Dorothy returns to Kansas, back to her old life with her family. Dorothy wore a corset-like dress to make sure that her filling-out figure was not revealed this made the look of an eleven-year old is preserved. The film ends with the moral that there is no place like home, no matter how exotic and fantastic. Far from being depressing and anti-fantasy, the film encourages young people to be creative with their minds. There is no reason that Bert Lahrs Zeke cannot be transformed into The Cowardly Lion though creative day-dreaming. I know when I saw it as a small child I liked to day dream and try to go to the Land of Oz myself. From then on out as a child if I were having a bad day I would just lay in bed and try to go away. It was very relaxing to try and use my imagination to visit the tin man, the lion, the scarecrow and the Wizard.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

One of the most likable movies ever made,"The Wizard of Oz is one of those movies that it's hard not to like, and I'm not just saying because everyone else likes it and you feel obligated to like it. It's just such a sweet and charming film, that if you do dislike it I bet you feel kind of like an asshole. So this film has definitely earned it's rebutation as a classic.However, there are a few plot holes in the story, such as why the witch doesn't just take Dorthy when she doesn't have Glinda to protect her. Or they may just drop a major part of the film. Remember the fact that Toto is bound by law to be killed at the beginning, and then it just sort of is never brought up again. And am I the only one who thinks Judy Garland is a little too old for this. She was sixteen when she filmed it, but she is playing a twelve year old, yet to me she always kind of looked like she was in her early twenties.Now let's talk about the special effects, while watching this today, I still ask how they did some of these. Yes some of them are quite obvious, but others seem like they need CGI to be able to become reality. All the characters are extremely likable, and in the middle of the film when it gets dark I honestly feel really sad for Dorthy and want her to get back home. The songs are catchy, despite a few being very similar in tune. And this film looks beautiful, I mean don't get me wrong, ""Citizen Kane"" was technically a fantastic movie, but this film came out two years earlier, does some really unique stuff too and is in color, so why is this always rated lower. And it just leaves you with a good feeling, with a nice moral.While The Wizard of Oz isn't perfect, it's just such a likable movie, I can't really imagine people hating this movie. Sure it has some plot holes and some stuff doesn't make sense, but it's just a beautiful, likable, and well executed movie with great characters and songs.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
the depression,"i realized as i watched the last frames that no place like home meant so much at this time to so many young people. young people had to leave their families and pretty much starve to death to save their mothers, dads, and babies. far from being a surface fantasy film, i think this film is about the trials so many faced in the thirties. how many young people today would rather stay at home than venture out into the world of possibilities? not many! children in Iowa leave their families and just go elsewhere. its rather sad! in our town it is a struggle to keep them here. even my son lives in another town not far away, but not here, not with his family. family meant so much in the thirties because families were torn apart and the potential for love was so poignant because of that! my heart breaks that children were parted from their parents so early and cast into wilderness, bleak and forlorn. the hippies of my generation experienced a similar fate for very different reasons. i was fortunate and got to spend many years getting to know my parents well. for good and for bad. i am so glad i got that chance! for me it was one day i woke up and my family had gone. all of them. i was so alone. i still miss them today. my mother left her family in the thirties with my father and made a living in the south. later when my grandmother was having health problems they return north and lived with her for her remaining years. i was so proud of them! i tried to do the same thing but was unable and my mother didn't want anything to do with me. i dream often of my homes i have left. they are so real i could touch them. in fact sometimes in my dreams i know they are dreams and realize the validity of that mental touch in awe. my family home will always exist in my heart. truly there is no place like home. love you mom and dad.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"""Some people without a brain do an awful lot of talking!""","The Wizard Of Oz (1939) -This film, like the L. Frank Baum book before it, was just brilliant and it will outlast all of the attempts to remake or replicate it, although I can't understand how no one has managed to improve upon it since, as the story is so well known and with such great rounded characters.Most of the newer versions have tried to do things a bit too differently and I think that is why they have failed, but surely a like for like version made in the 2020's with a decent budget should be able to blow this 80 year old film out of the water?But, I'm not convinced that they could. There was a fantastic campness, quality and beauty to this film that introduced us to such wonderful songs as 'Over The Rainbow' and 'We're Off To See The Wizard' and also to many wonderful sayings and of course memes.Judy Garland would be hard to beat in her role of Dorothy and although Margaret Hamilton, as The Wicked Witch Of The West was all kinds of ham, cheese and corny and not the best actor, surely that is all part of what makes this film still so charming today.And it was obvious that, for the most part, a lot of thought, time and energy went in to the making of this film, along with a large budget, because the sets, costumes, props and other production elements were all superb for 1939. It would be hard for me to think of another film that comes close to this one for these things, that has had so much recognition and longevity.Of course some of the cast could have done with a few more acting lessons and not all of those were bit parts, but once again I thought that it was fun to laugh along with the almost pantomimic style of performance that some of them delivered, while Judy and Frank Morgan, who played the Wizard Of Oz, performed their roles so well.My favourite character has and probably always will be the Lion, played by Bert Lahr. He gave a brilliant and comedic performance with some cracking one liners that could be missed if you didn't give it full attention.I did find it odd to watch again having recently read Gregory Maguire's 'Wicked' series of books, because they took such liberties with the original source novel's story and differed very greatly to this film, so that I found myself trying to match it all up. If you are a fan of this film, I probably wouldn't recommend those books, because although they did at least continue in that exciting fantasy realm and expanded on the well loved characters, I don't believe that they did it with the same panache as Baum would have done and did with his continued Oz adventures that tend to get forgotten about. Maguire's works were very political and far too adult to work with Baum for a start.This film though has stood the test of time against so many remakes and copies and sequels and all sorts of other things, yet remains the best of them all, obviously helped by the fact that the tale was so well created by L. Frank Baum in the first place and Ms. Garland's iconic voice and skilled delivery.971.09/1000.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The best movie ever made!,"The Wizard of Oz is a long-standing family favorite of ours. My mother remembers seeing it at the theater when she was a child, coming home afterward, and standing on her bed singing ""'fi were king of the forest..."". How precious is that? As a child in the 60's, I received a vinyl album with the entire movie's soundtrack (dialog included) that I played day after day, year after year. Wish I still had it....would be worth a fortune (except for all the scratches from being much loved & played, ha ha). After 46 years and at least 100 viewings of this tremendous classic, I still never tire of it. If flipping through the 750 channels on satellite & I happen to come across it, everything stops & the remainder is eagerly watched. Was there ever a voice more pure? A plot more intriguing? A creature scarier than the flying monkey's? Hands down the only movie that can transport you to being a child again!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This is the BEST movie on earth!,Everybody should watch this movie. Though most of the songs suck the movie is creative and very realistic. Doesn't use all that computerized fake crap to make a movie. Also the movie is not all about sex like most movies are.This is my favorite movie.There is also a series of Wizard Of Oz books By L. Frank Baum. Best fantasy books that I ever read. The books delve further into The Wizard Of Oz.There is also several remakes of The Wizard Of Oz movies which came out much later. I feel though that the original movie with Judy Garland in it was the best.Hope this has been helpful. :-),10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A superlative fantasy film for young and old alike,"Somehow I managed to live almost twenty-nine years of my life without seeing this universally beloved film, believed to be the most-watched film in history. Then I finally did see it and it was like taking a step back into childhood.Looking at the cast I think to myself that no-one delivered a performance that could truly be called Oscar-worthy and, yet, replace any one of the actors and it just wouldn't be the same. Simply put, these people were perfect for their respective parts and played them with relish.The film's look is exceptional. The land of Oz brought to life in glorious Technicolor is a sight to behold. The transition from sepia tone to color and back again was a nice touch, too. Sure, some of the effects work is decidedly rudimentary but to me that only adds to the charm. Of course, there's also the music to consider. The score deservedly won one of the film's two Oscars and the legendary song ""Over the Rainbow"" garnered the other.However, the thing that really seals the deal for this film is the story. Not only is it entertaining, it also has immense meaning to both young and old. Isn't there a part of all of us that longs for the security of home? Don't we all doubt our own courage, intellect and compassion from time to time? Of course; that's why the film speaks to us on such an emotional level.If you've avoided this film because you thought that it was nothing more than a kiddie movie then I urge you to reconsider. Don't miss out on one of the finest films ever to come out of Hollywood.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One Of The Best Fantasy Movies Of All Time.,"This may surprise you, but I was born in 1998, and yet I didn't see The Wizard of Oz until circa 2009, when I was 11.I didn't own it before then, and while my Uncle did, I for some reason never watched it over at his house. The Wizard of Oz would play on TBS at Christmas Time, preceded by the Animated Grinch special from 1966, but it aired at 8pm and I had an 8:30 bedtime.As such, I would get up to ""You're off to see the wizard, the wonderful Wizard of Oz!"" and it would be time for me to go off to bed.However, my sister asked for The Wizard of Oz for her birthday one year, and my Uncle got her a VHS of it. She didn't watch it much, but I certainly did. I've seen the movie in whole about 11 times- on VHS, DVD, and TV. And I will be seeing it many times in the future.The plot is familiar to most. It stars Judy Garland as Dorothy, a Kansas teen who lives on a farm with her Aunt Em, Uncle Henry, and dog Toto, and wishes for a more fulfilling life ""somewhere over the rainbow"".She unexpectedly gets this hope granted when sucked up into a tornado, and finds herself in the technicolor world of Munchkin Land. Dorothy immediately wants to go home, and the Good Witch Glinda tells her to see The Wizard of Oz by following the Yellow Brick Road.However, Glinda also gives her some Ruby Slippers that are coveted by the Wicked Witch of the West, and she chases Dorothy with the intent of getting them. Dorothy also befriends a Scarecrow who desires a brain, a Tin Man who wants a heart, and a lion who wants courage so he can be King of the Forest.One great thing about The Wizard of Oz is the songs. Musicals are one of my favorite genres of film, so much so that there is a spot in my Top 10 just for musicals. My favorite musical movie is My Fair Lady, but The Wizard of Oz ranks up with it.The most iconic song in the movie is Over The Rainbow, but there are other great songs in the film, like the ""If I Only"" songs, where the characters sing about what life with a brain, heart, and courage would be like. There's also a great song for their welcome into Oz and the Munchkins sing some delightful tunes as well.This includes my favorite song in the movie, Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead, in which the Munchkins cheerfully celebrate the death of the Wicked Witch of the East.In fact, I live with my Grandma. A couple years ago I watched The Wizard of Oz on TV on Easter while recovering from COVID. Shortly later, my Grandma had a fall and needed her walker a little more often.One day around this time, she asked me to move her walker AROUND her while she was sitting down. I accidentally lifted it OVER her, and she said: ""Well, don't drop it on top of me!"" I set it down no problem, and then I marched in place and sang:""Ding dong the witch is dead! Which old witch? The Wicked Witch!...
Let them know the wicked witch is dead!""She gasped in fake offense, but when I tell people that story, it gives them a good laugh.The Wizard of Oz also has many great lines, ones that even those who have never seen the movie would know, such as: ""Toto, I have a feeling we are not in Kansas anymore"", ""Lions, tigers, and bears oh my"", ""Follow the yellow brick road"", and the most famous one of all: ""There's no place like home."" Then there's my absolute favorite: ""I'm melting! What a world, what a world!""In fact, The Wizard of Oz is simply too iconic to say much more. Even those who have never seen this are most likely familiar with most of these songs and quotes. Even before I was 11, I was aware of lines like: ""I'm melting"", though that was in part due to the VeggieTales parody The Wonderful Wizard of Ha's.Sadly, even though The Wizard of Oz is aimed at kids, I don't think many kids today see it. Most kids seem more into Frozen and Moana than they are into The Wizard of Oz. That's not to bash Frozen and Moana, not at all, but it's unfortunate that, at least to my knowledge, it's not that common among kids today.Parents reading this, please show The Wizard of Oz to your kids. It's a classic and one of the best movies ever made, and no child should grow up without it. I had to wait until I was 11, don't do that to your children.The Wizard of Oz is a classic that lives up to its acclaim, and it should be seen by everyone. Simply put, it's one of the best fantasy movies of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Despite dated elements, there's an undeniable charm and magic to enchants kids today","I took my kids to watch the TCM revival showing of ""The Wizard of OZ"" on the big screen and my 6 and 9-year old were just as enchanted and terrified of the film as I was as a child. I won't bother to summarize the plot, because everyone already knows the story. Rewatching it now, it's fun to see how this film has influenced everything from the 1980s version of ""Flash Gordon,"" to Jim Henson's ""Labyrinth,"" to obscure sci-fi comedies like ""Heartbeeps,"" to even J.R.R. Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings."" The film is admittedly slow at times, some songs are better than others (""If I Only Had a Brain"" and ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" are the high points), and it's incredibly corny though out, but there is an undeniable charm and magic to the proceedings. Although many newer films have better special effects, less mannered of acting, and far better production design, they don't hold a candle to the wonder and magic of this true American film classic.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Magical Experience,"Wizard of Oz never gets old. It may have been released eight decades ago, but it could be released tomorrow and several people would still go to see it and they would enjoy it.

simply beyond criticism,"What more needs to be said about a film that has gone beyond the status of a mere classic to become an enduring part of our national heritage? Is there anyone alive unfamiliar with Dorothy or Toto or the tornado or the Munchkins or the Yellow Brick Road or the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion, the Wicked Witch of the West, the Emerald City, the Great and Powerful Oz, the ruby slippers, or the fact that there's no place like home?Before the age of home entertainment most people knew the movie only from its frequent television screenings (always introduced, in our youth, by Danny Kaye), but seeing the film uninterrupted by commercials (and preferably on a big screen) is the best way to appreciate the fairy-tale simplicity of L. Frank Baum's story and the wealth of his imagination, in no way compromised by the economy of the film's Depression-era 1939 budget. This is one of those rare adaptations that is actually better than the original book: a film that will never grow old, for people who will never grow old.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
There's no place like Oz!,"Victor Fleming made two movies in 1939, Gone With The Wind and The Wizard Of Oz. This may be the most played movie of all time and left children of all ages a classic, quoted as much as that other movie. We all know Judy Garland and the dreamlike story, but it continues to work for me due to it's altruist quartet together on their journey for personal completion. As they often meet up with the terrifying Margaret Hamilton and her army of flying monkeys, the struggle to find their way home is rewarded by the self help revelations which seemingly grant each their wish. There's movie theaters where we can escape, AA meetings and their like where we can seek self improvement, and there's home, of course. But there's no place like Oz that puts them all together",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the three greatest movies ever made.,"A Beautiful Mind, Cassablanca, and THIS ... The Wizard of Oz. Every cast member perfect in their respective role(s). The photography, the use of sepia tone and then wonderful colour, the music, the songs and choreography, the sets and costumes, the makeup, the wonderful plot, all things perfectly handled and unsurpassed. The lion starts to roar at the beginning of this thing and I start to get all blubbery. My only wish is that the Jitter Bug sequence be available. That wonderful part that was cut out due to length and time and left to rot as worthless celluloid on the cutting room floor. ~sigh~ Oh well. There has never been, and there will never be, another movie like this one.This movie, this work of art, is so comfortable that to go to Oz with Dorothy is just like going home, sweet, home. And, as you know, there's no place like home.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What more can you say about it?,"Come on! You know what happens in ""The Wizard of Oz""! All that I can do is try to analyze it. Joseph Campbell always talked about the hero's journey, and ""TWOO"" is clearly that. Maybe Dorothy is a different kind of hero, but a hero nonetheless. Obviously, released as it was towards the end of the Depression and near the beginning of WWII, perhaps ""TWOO"" was a sign of new things to come.We can look at connections to other things. As many people know, Buddy Ebsen was originally cast as the Tin Man, but the makeup gave him an allergic reaction. If it hadn't, then think about it...Jed Clampett as the Tin Man! I suspect that some people might take offense at the negative portrayal of witches (as ""Bewitched"" showed, witches are hot!), but there were also good witches. And since Mary Ann on ""Gilligan's Island"" was based on Dorothy, we can read into it further: the Scarecrow has no brain, like Gilligan; the Tin Man has no heart, like Mr. Howell; the Lion has no courage, like both Mrs. Howell and Ginger (or do those two have courage?); the Wicked Witch of the West is a bully, like the Skipper; and the Wizard knows everything, like the Professor.That all reminds me. When I was in 6th grade, my class went to see a re-release of ""TWOO"". One of my classmates said that the Scarecrow, Tin Man and Lion would make good politicians, because the Tin Man has no heart, like Pat Buchanan; the Scarecrow has no brains, like Bob Dole; and the Lion has no courage, like Steve Forbes.Oh, well. Life goes on. I guess that the point is that ""The Wizard of Oz"" will always be there. It's a true classic in every sense of the word.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Palpitating In My Pajamas,"""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre?"" Dumb. ""The Hills Have Eyes?"" Boring. ""The Exorcist?"" Humorous. ""The Shining?"" Lots of fun. Any of them scary? Naw. Why not? Because as a kid, I survived a viewing of ""The Wizard of Oz.""It is true that I no longer find movies frightening. Some of them, like ""The Shining"", are downright creepy, but I haven't been scared by a movie since I was a young boy. ""The Wizard of Oz"" with its evil flying monkeys, wicked witches, and the gigantic phantom-like head of Oz himself - accompanied by smoke and fire - was frightening enough to make me hide under the bed for the rest of my life. I'm telling you, that scene where the Wicked Witch of the West throws a fireball that ignites the scarecrow nearly made me mess my little drawers. Even the opening scenes with the dread Almira Gulch and the nasty Kansas twister had me palpitating in my pajamas.Although I won't admit to being scared by it anymore, I still watch The ""Wizard of Oz"" every year or two. It is incredible that this film was made in 1939. The special effects for that day and age are astounding (I still don't know how they did those soaring simians). The whole movie seems fresh and ageless. The entire cast is outstanding, led by Judy Garland's unforgettable turn as Dorothy Gale. Heck, even Terry as Toto gives one of the most memorable canine performances of all time.Perhaps the most enduring and endearing scene is Garland's rendering of the Harold Arlen and E. Y. Harburg song ""Over the Rainbow."" Just watching that scene makes me think of spring - you know; rainbows, bluebirds, skies that are blue, and impending tornadoes.Director Victor Fleming gives us the film's opening and closing scenes in sepia-toned black and white. The scenes in Oz are in Technicolor. This is a stroke of interpretive genius, giving the whole Oz experience a fantastic dreamlike quality. The fact that Fleming directed this and ""Gone With The Wind"" in the same year is astounding.I'm not sure I've seen a movie this decade that can match either of those.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The Dark Side of the Rainbow (alternate soundtrack review),"9 Stars for the movie itself, but only about 4 stars with the alternate soundtrack (read on...) The Wizard of Oz / The Dark Side of the Moon soundtrack In honor of the Wizard of Oz's 70th Anniversary, I decided to rewatch it.However, instead of reviewing a film we've all seen 25 or more times, I decided to investigate the myth surrounding the synchronicity of this film to the 1973 Pink Floyd album, The Dark Side of the Moon. The phenomenon sometimes referred to as ""The Dark Side of the Rainbow"".To begin with, I checked all the 'net sources I could find – most were in agreement, that proper synchronicity is achieved by starting the Pink Floyd disc as soon as the MGM lion roars for the 3rd time. So, with a big bowl of popcorn in one hand, and a Dunkelweizen in the other, I prepared for a psychedelic experience to outdo the finale of 2001: A Space Odyssey or the first I ever heard ""Interstellar Overdrive"" (hey, now there's an idea for a pairing).Sadly, I have to say that it did not blow my mind. Twenty years of rumors, and this is what I get? To be fair, I was not under the influence of any unusual substances – O.K., a couple beers, but I do everything under the influence of a couple beers. I suppose that those who do enough of the right drugs can probably find connections in any DVD/CD pairing (Dude, Britney is totally singing the soundtrack to Shindler's List on her debut album!!!) .I will concede that there are quite a few points of synchronicity between the two. They do in fact complement each other – to an extent. But the band members have repeatedly denied any intentional connections between the two, and I for one believe them. What then accounts for this seeming synchronicity? I believe I have an answer for that.To begin with, both deal heavily with Freudian aspects of the psyche. That has been a hallmark of Pink Floyd's music from the beginning. Even after demented genius Syd Barrett was institutionalized, the remaining members of Pink Floyd were keenly aware that Barrett's introspective lyrics were a key element of the band's appeal.L. Frank Baum, for his part wrote The Wonderful Wizard of Oz to be a modern update of age-old fairy tales deeply rooted in the human psyche, and the characters themselves are concerned with primary desires of the id – home (shelter) for Dorothy, courage for the lion, etc. This Freudian connection was deepened by the filmmakers who took an Oz as dream approach, both in dreamlike experiences in Oz (the poppy field for example) as well as the entrance and exit of Dorothy passing out on a bed (""It was all a dream).Second of all, The Wizard of Oz is, let's not forget, a musical. One doesn't need to have more brains than the Scarecrow to figure out that a film based around music is likely to sync up pretty well with another piece of music. And so it does; many of the alleged match up points are song and dance routines. While Dark Side is a great match, I wouldn't be surprised if a pairing with, say, Sgt. Peppers wouldn't provide an equally interesting result.While we're on the subject of myths, I also looked for the other big Wizard of Oz urban legend – the hanged man. Allegedly a member of the cast or crew who committed suicide can be seen in one of the scenes along the Yellow Brick Road. Maybe it would be different if I saw it on the big screen, but all I saw at the appointed scene was an amorphous shape in the deep background that could have been well literally anything! In conclusion I'd say that what this exercise did yield for me was a great bit of nostalgia. It reaffirmed in my mind that both of these two artworks are masterpieces, and deserve undivided attention. I couldn't help but wish I were fully focused on enjoying one or the other.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Family Fantasy and Mythical Adventure That Still, Somehow, Holds Up","Tough to find a film that's more universally recognized and adored than this one, and with good reason. It's charming and quaint, relic of a bygone era where naivete was a-okay and being earnest wasn't seen as a handicap. Loaded with unforgettable lines and classic songs, nothing feels elbowed-in or insignificant, and I say that as a viewer with very little patience for musical interludes. Sometimes it's nice to just climb into that time capsule and relive your own childhood (as I have to think a vast majority of the current population first saw it at that age), but it also serves as an impressive example of thoughtful, creative filmmaking. The famous mid-scene switch from sepia tones to full-blown Technicolor remains especially stunning, a masterful reveal that immediately brings the land of Oz to life with a roar, and the intense, colorful landscapes that light up every scene never let up. A few seams may show here and there, particularly around the matte paintings in recent HD transfers, but in some ways that works to the film's benefit. Clearly, a tremendous amount of love and care went into this one, and that still radiates as warmly today as it did almost eighty years ago. Well-balanced, evenly paced and visually dazzling, it's aged stupendously and stands tall as a cornerstone of family cinema. My kids loved it, though they weren't as petrified of the flying monkeys as I was at their age, and I loved sharing it with them.

INFINITY,"This is a special movie that requires an in-depth analysis. After a thorough research I found that the book ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"", which the film is based on, was declared ""America's greatest and best-loved homegrown fairytale"" by the Library of Congress. This charming story really merits it. Therefore, the contribution of the author L.Frank Baum deserves recognition.As for the movie, various psycho-philosophical interpretations are possible. The story takes place in two worlds with the same characters in different forms. On one world, the real one presumably, Dorothy lives with her aunt Em and uncle Henry. But she feels unhappy with her life and thinks people don't love her. After a tornado, she finds herself flying up in the sky and lands on the magical land of Oz. There she meets three interesting characters, namely, a scarecrow, a tinman and a lion. All are unhappy with their lives either. The scarecrow wishes to have a brain, the tinman wishes to have a heart and the lion wishes to have courage. Dorothy wishes to return home. They all together set off to the Emerald city to find the Wizard of Oz who would fulfill their wishes.During her encounters with the wicked witches, Dorothy does not fight them, and kills both of them accidentally. Hence she preserves her juvenile manner all the time and does not become a monster (see Nietzsche).In the Emerald city they discover that the Wizard of Oz is just an impostor with no special talents. He offers them some rewards and convinces them that they already have what they needed and their wish is fulfilled (see Freud). Dorothy later returns home by just tapping her heels together three times. As she opens her eyes in the real world, she fills with joy and becomes thankful for having everything she needs. This is the affirmation of life (see Nietzsche).In the movie, Judy Garland is very talented while playing an exuberant teenage girl. The narrative is very joyous and blended with beautiful songs. Especially, ""Over the rainbow"" sung by Judy Garland at the beginning of the film is sublime. Her interaction with the dog is apparently improvised.Due to the exceptional narrative giving both direct and subtle messages, it is hard to describe but it evokes the feeling of INFINITY in oneself. I viewed it twice (for now) with an interval of about 35 years and felt exactly the same in both.In my opinion, this movie deserves to be among top 20 movies of all times. You can put it anywhere in your list between number 1 and 20, but it doesn't deserve any less. Some trendy movies which have somehow risen in the list will lose their charm over time, but this movie is ETERNAL!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Cinematic Masterpiece,"The Wizard of Oz was a technical and visual marvel when it was first released in 1939, pushing the boundaries of what could be accomplished on film. Despite numerous behind-the-scenes issues that marred the production, it was a film that wowed the world and propelled Judy Garland into superstardom and an infamy that would be viewed simultaneous to her name years and years after her passing.
Now, in 2020, The Wizard of Oz is every bit as fresh, entertaining and moving as it was the day it first came out. Judy's stellar performance of Over the Rainbow never fails to bring tears, Margaret Hamilton's deliciously malicious cackles still terrify, and Frank Morgan's Emerald City is still as pretty as it ever was before.
With the help of Warner Bros.' fantastic 4K transfer, The Wizard of Oz looks even nicer, bringing out the absolute best the original nitrate negatives had to offer, bringing us closer to what Oz looked like on set than we've ever been before.The story is simple - a young girl who dreams of being in a better place than her small Kansas home is whisked away by a magic twister and taken to the land of Oz. Once there, all she wants is to go back home, travelling along the Yellow Brick Road to get to the Wizard for help getting home - but it's so charming and endearing all these years later.Everyone involved in this film gave it their all despite less than ideal conditions.

A Wonderful Classic.,"This 1939 classic can be just much enjoyed as a story itself as it can for its blind metaphors of which at first can go over peoples' heads and for many years.The very significances of which make this a classic are what keep us coming back including the colorful special effects along with the songs as well as the music.What more can one say but let's go down the yellow brick road as many times as we can and think of how the characters on the whole do make The Oz Wonderland possible along with why Dorothy upon her return/awakening she both does and doesn't admit that it's a dream.Truthfully,Stephen ""Steve"" G.

Still an amazing watch today!,"It's no wonder, audiences had a hard time in the early 1900s, enjoying the previous incarnations of the Wizard of Oz. Released in theaters as early as 1910, audiences wanted more from these early attempts. They wanted more, than just guys in bad horse costumes, cheezie bat costumes and effects, that even audiences in 1914 felt, did not look good. The film industry was not ready for the kind of storytelling, that L. Frank Baum needed to have, in order to make these films appealing to the audience of the day. These types of films needed more time to pass. They needed Hollywood to evolve and grow more. They needed to wait until 1939.From the black & white land of Kansas to the colorful world of Oz, everyone has seen the Wizard of Oz (1939). Everyone can hum ""Somewhere over the Rainbow"". Most everyone can name Dorothy, Toto, Scarecrow, the Tin Woodsman and the Cowardly Lion. Everyone knows the main antagonist is the Wicked Witch of the West and a tornado strands Dorothy in the land of Oz. All know the Yellow Brick Road will take her to the Emerald City, where the Wizard resides. Why is that? Because, the Wizard of Oz (1939) is one of those near-perfect films, that can stand the test of time. It can even entertain the CGI generation of the 21st century. It is a film that talks to us and reminds us, that, ""there's no place like home"". It reminds us that our wishes can come true. It tells us that achieving your goals is much like strengthening your heart, brain and courage.The 1939 MGM classic is a technical achievement of near perfection. The, 80 year old effects still work today. The performances by all the actors, singers and dancers is still entertaining today. The story is put together perfectly and the characters actually have a depth to them, that makes it feel like you have known them for 80 years. You see tiny influences from the earlier film attempts, most notably the transformation from B&W to color, found in the Ted Eshbaugh's technicolor, animated short, the Wizard of Oz (1933). There are also influences from the Broadway show, but the 1939 MGM classic, is the one that set the goal post for achievements in film, not just for ""Oz"" films, but for everything that came after it.The story if Oz itself, the future, legendary, often spoken chronicling of Judy Garland's life and just the abstract idea of a yellow brick road, has influenced pop culture, for over a century. It dates back, all the way back, to the year 1900, when the first book came out. This is a film, that everyone should see. Movie buffs, who haven't seen the film, are missing out. This film is a textbook example of how to make a great film. This movie is a film-lovers dream and seeing it today in HD, on a huge clear TV, makes it even better. Make sure you watch it in its proper 4:3 aspect ratio though. You lose too much of the top and bottom of the original film, if you see it in widescreen.9.4 (A MyGrade) = 9 IMDB.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Following the yellow bricks path...,"""The Wizard of Oz"" is probably one of the five most popular movies ever, along with ""Gone with the wind"", ""Casablanca"", etc. It was a technical revolution (one of the first color movies) and everyone agrees that it's sickly sweet and sentimental and that there is not a character more affected than Dorothy Gale... Whatever, the colours, all those mythical scenes, ""Over the rainbow""... It's a classic and that's that! I don't like musicals, I've never understood those movies in which the characters begin to sing with no reason, but ""Wizard of Oz"" is an exception, as well as ""Willy Wonka"" or ""The Rocky Horror Picture ShoW""WE'RE Going' TO SEE THE WIZARD!!!PD: Can anyone tell me which one was the very first color movie??+My rate: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Movie fantasy at its best, children love it still","We're off to see the Wizard, the wonderful Wizard of Oz! Yeah!Dorothy (Judy Garland) escapes her dull farm life when she is swept away in a tornado. Arriving in the magical land of Oz, Dorothy soon realises that though all she ever wanted was excitement and adventure, all she loves and craves and longs for is to be home, with her family
Accompanied by three very strange companions, Dorothy start across Oz to find a wizard (Frank Morgan) who should be able to help her find her way home. Unfortunately a Wicked Witch (Margaret Hamilton) is pulling out all the stops to get Dorothy's Ruby Slippers - which were given to her when she killed another Wicked Witch, by accident.An absolute and wonderful classic. Superbly accessible and very very funny this is a movie that just keeps giving. Not timeless but just beautiful to watch. The transition from Kansas to Oz is very well handled.Based on the books by Frank Baum the movie is a mish-mash of several stories but is so well done you don't care. It was done well enough to win to be nominated for the Best Picture Academy award and won Best Original Score and Best Original Song, for ""Over the Rainbow"". Of course has spawned the stage sensation Wicked!Things to look out for: Bert Lahr's Lion ""stick em up"", Margaret Hamilton's Wicked Witch, the Lollipop Guild, wonderful songs, ""over the rainbow"", Toto, ""Follow the yellow brick road"".The DVD is stuffed full of very good extras.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Greatest fantasy trip of all time!,"Movies like this usually come once in a lifetime. It's been over 60 years and people still watch it in admiration. New generations are also discovering and appreciating its messages of benignity, optimism, and aspiration. The story is simple, Dorothy and her beloved dog Toto are transported to the brightly-colored world of Oz after a tornado hits Kansas. She wants to get home but must first follow the yellow brick road leading to Emerald City where only one person can help her--The Wizard of Oz. Along the way, she makes three best friends in the form of a talking Scarecrow, a heartless Tin Man, and a Cowardly Lion. She also faces wits with the Wicked Witch of the West who is after those magical ruby slippers. Everything about this film is superlative. The cinematography is gorgeous. We start off in a black and white Kansas where the landscape looks dry and desolate. Then the film transitions to an eye candy Technicolor world called Oz. It also has ingeniously-written musical numbers performed by some of the greatest talents of yesteryear. Judy Garland leads a wonderful cast full of paramount performers. Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr, and Jack Haley are unforgettable as Dorothy's three sidekicks. Frank Morgan (in 5 roles) is terrific and Margaret Hamilton is wickedly fun as Miss Gulch and the Wicked Witch of the West.

A film that really earns its classic status,"""The Wizard Of Oz"" is one of those films you hear about, it has gained the elusive title of a classic. However, the constant hype and merchandising could lead one to forget just how good it is. While some classics fail to live up to the hype ""The Wizard of Oz"" isn't one of those films. First off its pacing is masterful, most films struggle in the pacing department, the pacing was one of the only issues I took with 2023's ""Barbie"". However this film is super tight, almost no scenes feel unnecessary or out of place. Everything flows naturally and by the end you're barely aware that it's been over an hour. The visuals are also dazzling, with gorgeous sets and costumes that make you want to travel to this fantasy land yourself. The characters are simple but charming, and the performers really sell them. The technology is revolutionary with the use of technicolor and the tornado effects. Plus, classic songs that are still hummable.

"""Somewhere over the Rainbow.""","I am an adaptation of the popular novel first saw when I was 10 years old. THE WIZARD of OZ has left a mark. The film, in which can be enjoyed by the entire family, especially young and children. So many colors, songs and magic did not hurt. There are not many films that children can fraud broad smile in one part and few tears at the end.Changing the black and white goods in the movie ""in color"" is certainly magic in itself. I think there was a key to the world ""over the rainbow"". This is unquestionably the most important moment of the film. Dorothy (Judy Garland) She left their loved ones and the hard life on the farm with the magical game of unfortunate circumstances and ""dreamed"" in the land of their dreams. In the dream, she wants only one thing, to return home, or rather to awaken. Parody and somewhat true. Dreams are really beautiful and fascinating, ugly and frightening.Wizard of Oz is a very direct a movie. I think the kids watching this movie get a certain confidence. Older viewers coming back to their childhood. Where is the magic began. Magic does not have to be exclusively beautiful. Honestly, never. The effect is twofold. The story comes down to a trip or maybe a little more extreme told getaway. Friends and travel almost always provoke a spell.Judy Garland glowed. Such a combination of joy and sadness at some young actress is rarely seen. I got the impression that all the other actors enjoy their roles. Margaret Hamilton is unforgettable in the role of an evil witch. They all seem relaxed and simply. The ending is painful, but I doubt that someone from the beauty and magic of sleep woke up unhappy.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Judy brings magic on every step,"The wizard of Oz is a colorful classic, that is filled with thrills and it is a straight shooter right from the start to the very end. From following the yellow brick road to finally meeting the wizard himself, it was a bumpy ride that I always look forward to going again.Filmed mostly in Technicolor, except the opening scenes which was shot in sepia-tinted black and white, The Wizard of Oz has stood the test of time as a top fantasy movie, with highly unusual characters. The movie is based on a book titled The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum, and although it did differ a lot from the book, this movie is the best adaptation that is near to its original book story.The movie plot is about Dorothy (Judy Garland) and her dog Toto who got caught in a tornado's path and somehow end up in the land of Oz. At Oz she mistakenly killed the wicked witch of the East, who was a sister to the Wicked Witch of the west, who was now after her. Now Dorothy must find her way home and the only person who could help her is the Wizard of Oz.On her to see the wizard she meets along the way a Scarecrow with no Brains, a Tin Man with no Heart and a Lion without Courage. Together this team head off to see the wizard with the hope that the Wizard will meet all their needs.The movie production had its twists and turns, with Ray Bolger who was originally cast as the Tin Man and Buddy Ebsen was to play the Scarecrow had their roles switched later on. This switch was to the detriment of Ebsen who had an allergic reaction to the makeup of the Tin Man and Jack Haley was called to take his place.Another thing to note about this classic is how it deviated from its original book story, up to 40 differences can be sited; from the merging of characters to the overall theme of the movie, this 1939 fantasy film carved out its own theme: in the book Oz is real and Dorothy did get to return in Baum's later books, but in the movie Oz is just a dream that Dorothy had.The movies popular song, ""Over the Rainbow"" won best original song in the Oscars. Over the Rainbow has been re done by many artist notably Kyle Minogue during her treatment and recovery from breast cancer.Wizard of Oz is a classic that you must see, a nice fantasy film for you and the kids. Disney will be making a prequel to this classic, named Oz: The Great and Powerful the movie is set to be released in 2013 and it will star James Franco as the Wizard of Oz.www.lagsreviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I finally got to watch The Wizard of Oz on the big screen after years of only seeing it on TV!,"Like I'm sure many of you reading this, I first watched this classic movie when it aired on CBS during the '70s when that network still had annual showings of it. Last month or so, I saw it in a theatre for the first time with my movie theatre-working friend as it celebrated it's 80th anniversary. When Professor Marvel mentioned Isis, we both cracked how that word now inspires dread and when the Scarecrow mentioned some jokes about brains, I mentioned a certain President. I also mentioned to my friend how the only part I didn't like about the movie was the Lion's singing about being the King of the Forest as it really stopped the movie and not in a good way. The role of Dorothy was perfect for then 16-year-old Judy Garland even though the girl in the book was originally a pre-teen. And Thank Goodness calmer heads prevailed and her signature song, ""Over the Rainbow"", was not cut out! It won that deserved Oscar as did Judy for that special miniature Academy Award she got (though I hope she later replaced that with the more standard size!) It was such a treat seeing it on the big screen after years of watching it on TV. Only wish we weren't the only ones in the seats that day, though....",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the greatest movies ever made,"It's hard to pinpoint exactly why this is such a good movie. I loved it when I was a kid- and I can't say exactly why it was so good back then either. And yet I can't deny the fact that it's a great movie.The story sounds ludicrous if slightly charming- Dorothy, a young farm girl, gets caught in a tornado with her dog Toto and, when the storm finally sets her house down, finds herself in the magical land of Oz where she meets the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion, all of whom look strangely like the farmhands that work with her aunt and uncle. Dorothy is sent on a journey down the Yellow Brick Road to Emerald City to find the Wizard of Oz whom she is led to believe will help her get back to Kansas.Apparently, L. Frank Baum intended it as an allegory to the politics of the time, but I can't see why anyone would care about that when the movie stands on its own two legs just fine. I think the main reason it works so well is that there is never a feeling of ridiculousness throughout the entire movie. Oz is strange, but it's meant to be strange; it never feels completely unrealistic though. I think this has something to do with the contrast provided by the Technicolor applied to the film when Dorothy is Oz and the sepia look when Dorothy is in Kansas. Oz is a different world, but not an entirely unreal world. Our dreams may be larger than life, but there is always something very real about them.Maybe that's the special allure this movie always has for me. Oz is real in this movie. There's never a sure explanation of Oz as Dorothy's dream, but there might as well be. And when I dream, I want to escape into that world because sometimes it's more exciting and better. Dorothy's world is drab, and Oz helps her to see the good in it- the color in it.Metaphors aside, The Wizard of Oz is a fun movie. Somewhere Over the Rainbow is one of the best songs ever recorded, and many of the other songs in the movie are memorable. Judy Garland is obviously not an amazing actor, but her naïveté makes her performance very true and it's near impossible to imagine anyone else in the role.It may be hard for me to establish exactly why The Wizard of Oz has remained such a classic, but there's no difficulty in saying that it is truly a great movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The Wonder of Oz,"My early plan to watch Sam Raimi's OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL (2013) has been successfully foiled by the tepid reviews and in fear of another ALICE IN WONDERLAND (2010, 6/10) travesty, then it stroke to me that I had never even watched the worldly-famous 1939 version, it must be a presumably safe and better alternative.I'm indisputably way past the age which will be exalting to watch this family-friendly vaudeville for the very first time, I wish I could have done that around my childhood year so I would be more in shock-and-awe admiration for this haute crowd-pleaser and ground-breaking studio- based product.It all begins in Kansas, young Dorothy lives in a farm with his uncle and auntie, (after a melancholic rendition of OVER THE RAINBOW, still astounding and flawless) her tentative runaway with her cuddly puppy Toto has been persuaded by Professor Marvel (a very first introduction of multi-personae performance from Frank Morgan), en route, a twister rampages the farm and Dorothy and Toto (along with the house) has been brought to Wizard Oz's wonderland with the casualty of a star-crossed wicked witch (crushed by the house accidentally), and the shoddy superimposition of the airborne journey may be cutting-edge 74 years earlier, sadly it barely works even under an uncritical eye.The tangible visual transference from sepia farmland to the variegated Oz land grants a soothing refreshment and heralds a jovial adventure ahead, sing-a-longs with DING DONG THE WITCH IS DEAD (new entry at No. 2 in this week at UK Singles Chart in the wake of Thatcher's death), it is just carefree and mollifying one's hard-pressed nerves (if you have those). Then the classic characters (Scarecrow, Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion) successively accompany Dorothy to meet the great and mighty Oz.Despite of its all-comprising industry-reeking indoor design, it is a marvel how the film could be made in such a laborious scale and obedient order at its time, entering the second half of the film, when insouciant singing-and-dancing gives its way to the escapade of taking back the broomstick of The Wicked Witch of the West, all the set pieces are incontrovertibly stale and the logic of the story sags into an untenable farce (no specific elucidation of how the witch would succumb to a basin of water or what is so special about the red shoes the witch is hankering for, et al). The guarded-gate of the witch's castle must be the recipient of the homage from Sauron's gate from THE LORD OF THE RINGS.Acting-wise, Judy Garland is humble, mawkish but naturalistic in delivering jejune lines, Bert Lahr's Lion and Ray Bolger's Scarecrow otherwise are the film's best offers, also Margaret Hamilton's heinous witch, simply wish she had more venom to spill.Overall, it is a cartoonish adaption of children's best-known bedtime story, may be predisposed to be an overrated sensation which stands flimsily after a serious filmic anatomy, but the bent of director Victor Fleming and his crew has been testified positively through the arduous endeavor, and one can still relish 75-or-so years after its inception.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Wizard of Oz,"The Wizard of Oz (1939) is a fantasy musical film from MGM during its golden years. The actors that play the Oz roles are Ray Bolger (Scarecrow), Jack Haley (Tin Man), Bert Lahr (Cowardly Lion), Margaret Hamilton (Wicked Witch of the west), Frank Morgan (Emerald City Doorman/Cabbie/The Wizard's Guard/The Wizard of Oz), and Judy Garland (Dorothy Gale). Also all these actors and actresses (except Dorothy Gale) play a double role in Kansas and Oz. The Kansas roles are Ray Bolger (Hunk), Jack Haley (Hickory), Bert Lahr (Zeke), Margaret Hamilton (Miss Almira Gulch), and Frank Morgan (Professor Marvel). During the opening of the movie there is a message saying, ""For nearly forty years this story has given faithful service to the Young in Heart; and Time has been powerless to put it kindly philosophy out of fashion. To those of you who have been faithful to it in return...and to the Young in Heart...we dedicate this picture."" This makes the movie sounds like it's a fantasy for children or more or less for little girls. As the film progresses Dorothy comes in the farm to complain about Almira and how she is being mean to Toto the dog. Later Almira comes to take her dog with a sheriff warrant. As she rides the bike back to town with the dog in the back in the basket, the dog escapes and runs back to Dorothy. As soon as the dog comes back Dorothy realizes that Almira is going to come back and she decides to run away. As she is traveling she runs into professor Marvel, whom she asks if she can travel with him. But later the professor decides that he doesn't want her to come with him some he makes up lies about Dorothy aunt getting sick. As Dorothy rushes back to her aunt's farm there is a tornado by the farm. Locking the animals away the farm residents decide to go underground. When Dorothy arrives the tornado is close to the farm and the trees are flying off the ground as Dorothy runs to the house. This scene doesn't make sense because on average a tree weights more than a human being. Dorothy hides in the house and the window hits her; resulting she gets knocked unconscious on the bed. When she wakes up she realizes she is inside the tornado and she sees Almira riding her bike laughing and Almira turns into the wicked witch. While the tornado stops she realizes she is in some fantasy land (Oz). Dorothy is accused of being the savior of the munchkin people because she fell with her house on the wicked witch of the East that controlled them (munchkin people). The mayor of the munchkins calls it the day of independence because the death of the witch. Later Dorothy goes on a journey wearing the ruby slippers that the wicked witch of the west wants. While on her journey to meet the wizard that can take back to Kansas she meets a scarecrow (that is not scary), a tin man (who needs oil), and a tiger (who is a coward). While they are on the journey the wicked witch of the west plots a plan to put the crew to sleep. It works but only the scarecrow and tin man are not placed under the spell. They start yelling help and the good witch of the north makes it snow and wakes them up. They reach the city and all the residents are wearing green as they freshen up the wicked witch of the west come and scare the residents by spelling surrender Dorothy, leaving everyone in panic. Dorothy realizes that there is no wizard of oz and she breaks down and starts crying; as she is telling her story about her aunt getting sick the emerald city door man hears her and takes her to the wizard. When they see him they are petrified of the great fire and the floating head of the wizard. The wizard decides to grant them their wish only if they bring the broomstick of the witch of the west. Dorothy and the three go and search for the witch in the haunted forest and Dorothy and her dog get kidnapped by flying monkeys. Toto escapes to look for the other three and takes them to rescue Dorothy. Dorothy kills the witch with water, which is one of the worst endings one can think of. The crew gets the broom back and goes back to the wizard of oz and Dorothy discovers that he is a fake. Wizard leaves Dorothy and the good witch of the north arrives and tells her the truth that she can go back whenever she pleases. Then Dorothy awakens with her aunt and friends there and she tells them her story of fantasy. This picture is a little bit childish but it can be easily the movie of the 1940's, because of the color tone added to the black and white picture as soon as Dorothy goes into her fantasy state. The cuts and scenes of this movie are in a proper sequence except for the fact when she is in the tornado and the house falls there needs to be more details. When the house falls the scene doesn't show the witch getting hit and the impact of the house falling. The wizard of Oz is a movie that is remembered and cherish by many younger generations. The lesson learned from this movie is that running away is never good.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939)","""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939), directed by Victor Flemming primarily, and starring Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr and Jack Haley is one of the most classic films of all time.

I'm ashamed of what I have read,"First, I am perfectly fine with opinions. If you don't like the movie, that's okay. You have an opinion, I have one. They don't have to be the same.BUT, when you make statements such as ""whoever likes this film needs to wake up"" or any insulting statement, then I get frustrated.Anyway, this film is very great, considering the obviously technology that was there back when it was made. I watched an enhanced version and think that the movie's plot is very nice!The only main reason why I rate it a 9 is because 10/10 = perfect for me, and there is almost never going to be a movie that is perfect. Thus, it gets the next best thing.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Adrian, Review Of Wizard of Oz. 1939.","The Wizard Of Oz is a wonderful film. It came out in 1939 and won many awards. It was filmed in Technicolor, and had the ballad Somewhere over the rainbow. There was a dog Toto in the Film too. The Film is a classic now and very well beloved.

The Wonderful Wizard Of Oz,"""We're off to see the Wizard, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz...""It's impossible to simply read that line. One sees it and can't help but start humming that oh so familiar tune. Heck, forget humming, maybe you just want to burst out singing. And therein lies the magic of The Wizard of Oz, undoubtedly, and deservedly, one of the most beloved films of all time. Magical, and downright revolutionary in many ways, when it first premiered in 1939, The Wizard of Oz stands the test of time, forever a treat for all ages. What does this film have going for it? Start with a brilliantly conceived, and executed, story. Add in some of the most memorable acting performances of all time. Toss in what for the time was startlingly brilliant color and dazzling cinematography. Don't forget the wonderful special effects, which may seem mundane by modern standards, but which were simply amazing for their time. And oh, have I mentioned the songs? You'll be humming, or singing, for weeks after watching this one. ""We're Off To See The Wizard"", ""Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead!"", ""If I Only Had A Brain/Heart/Nerve"", ""Merry Old Land Of Oz"", ""It Really Was No Miracle""...each a toe-tapping, stick in your brain and refuse to leave treasure. And of course there is what would become Judy Garland's signature song, the incredibly poignant ""Over The Rainbow"", perfect in every way for the character of farm girl Dorothy in this film and made all the more poignant knowing the troubles which lay ahead for Garland in the years following the making of The Wizard of Oz.Who doesn't know by now the story of The Wizard of Oz? The film takes a little while to get moving in sepia-toned Kansas but those opening scenes are critical in introducing us to some very important people we'll encounter again in different guises later on. Once a twister picks up Dorothy's house and transports her and her dog, Toto, to Oz the real fun begins. When Dorothy opens the sepia-toned door of her house all of a sudden the screen is bursting with the most brilliant color you will ever see. The transition from dreary Kansas to magical Oz is simply breathtaking. And now the real fun begins. After spending some time with the tiny inhabitants of Munchkinland, and encountering witches both good and wicked, Dorothy follows the yellow brick road to the Emerald City where she hopes to meet the Wizard of Oz who may be the only one who can help her return home to Kansas. That journey along the yellow brick road may well be the most magical in film history.While Judy Garland in the role of Dorothy is the unquestioned star of the film The Wizard of Oz is graced with universally brilliant performances from a wonderfully diverse and talented cast of characters. Most notable are Dorothy's companions along the yellow brick road, The Scarecrow, The Tin Man and The Cowardly Lion, played by Ray Bolger, Jack Haley and Bert Lahr respectively. Even hidden behind layers of makeup, these three actors still manage to give their characters tremendous personality, something so critical in allowing the audience to identify with the characters they portrayed. Garland is undeniably brilliant but The Wizard of Oz just would not be the same without the extraordinary, and often overshadowed, talents of Bolger, Haley and Lahr. Special recognition to Bolger, the perfect scarecrow, who twists and turns and contorts himself in such a manner it's hard to believe he has a bone in his body.Billie Burke as Glinda the Good Witch, Margaret Hamilton as Dorothy's adversary, The Wicked Witch, and Frank Morgan in a number of memorable roles also have key parts to play and they are each terrific as well. And of course there are the multitude of Munchkins who provide a truly surreal beginning to Dorothy's magical journey. There's really not much to quibble with here, everything is almost pitch-perfect. Perhaps the opening scenes in Kansas could move a little quicker and maybe the stay in Munchkinland could be a little briefer, as the tiny Munchkins' cute factor begins to wane just a touch. But once Dorothy sets off on that yellow brick road The Wizard of Oz is undeniably one of the most magical movie experiences ever seen. A classic in its time and a classic for all time.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
CLASSIC,"This movie is the reason why I fell in love with musical! Aside from the cast being completely nuts, it is wonderful to see that when you are a professional in the industry, your work is remarkable and truly insightful to witness. Judy Garland was a gem in the business and it was so unfortunate for the world to have lost such a wonderful talent. The bright side of this is that we still have all of her work and this is one of the greatest pieces she has in her trophy shelf! You could never get tired of watching this film and singing along with these memorable songs cause we're off to see the wizard, the wonderful wizard of Oz!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
OZ!,"A film that i have returned to once again since my childhood. For being such an early film this is absolutely amazing One of the most cherished fantasy films to ever grace the screen, ""The Wizard of Oz"" stands as a crowning achievement in 1930's film making. The special effects are highly impressive considering the limited technology available at the time, not to mention they are infinitely more endearing than most CGI effects present in today's films. The lavish sets, impeccable costume design, and glowing Technicolor help to create a convincing and enchanting Land of Oz. And though obviously filmed on a sound stage, the sets never seem confining; thanks largely in part to the meticulous backdrop paintings .",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An unmissable piece of cinema,"The Wizard of Oz is the best you could ask of a movie made at the end of the 1930s. It boasts pleasent musical numbers and a production desing that could challenge most of the movies made today, sustained by engaging performances and a creative mind behind the camera. It is widely regarded as a masterpiece or even a perfect movie, and I do see why some would say that.I do not dislike the movie and I won't deny its achievements and sense of wonder: it is, at the end of the day, a great adaptation that changed cinema forever and helped broadcast the wonderful message within its source material to countless generations. But it does have flaws, like all movies do, and I end up thinking of films I personally consider better than this one. That won't stop me from popping this one to the Blu-ray player on a rainy day to relieve the fabulous journey awaiting Dorothy in the yellow brick road.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This quintessential gateway to movie fandom hasn't aged a day in 75 years.,"If the ultimate mark of deciding the greatest film of all time is the sheer number of people who have seen it, then a strong case could be made for The Wizard of Oz being the most enduring achievement in Hollywood history. Beloved by everyone from eight to eighty, the musical has entertained countless generations since its spellbinding release in 1939. It remains one of the first cinematic memories entrenched in the minds of many a self-respecting cinephile and now, on the eve of its 75th anniversary, the film has been re-released (in 3D, naturally), in all its visually arresting glory.When bloodthirsty farmgirl Dorothy Gale (a fresh-faced and stunning Judy Garland, in the role that launched her towards unabashed superstardom) is transported to the surreal landscape of Oz, she kills the first person she meets, then teams up with three strangers (Ray Bolger, Jack Haley & Bert Lahr) to kill again. Okay, maybe writer Rick Polito's famous synopsis is a little deceiving, but this is truly a film that needs no introduction.It's hard to forget just how gargantuan a legacy the film has left on the world of cinema and, indeed, the pop culture landscape. A delightful screenplay brimming with quotable material from co-writers Noel Langley, Florence Ryerson and Edgar Allan Woolf, and a range of eclectic musical numbers work in perfect harmony, from Garland's spine-tingling rendition of Somewhere over the Rainbow and the Tin Man's touching If I only had a Heart to more upbeat diddies like Ding, Dong, the Witch is Dead! And We're Off to See the Wizard.Although seasoned with an innumerable amount of on-set dramas and ludicrous urban legends, the film hasn't lost a touch of respectability in any department three-quarters of a century later. Margaret Hamilton's Wicked Witch is just as traumatising; the pulsing aesthetics of Oz just as mesmerising; the virginal Dorothy's realisation that ""there's no place like home"" just as sympathising. The whole experience is a product of a simpler time, so rich in history and innocence that even youngsters will somehow find themselves reminiscing about remote 1930s Kansas and its bone-deep, home-cooked morals.The 3D gives the film a little extra pop in places, but much like other conversions, it falls into the background after a while, likely to be all but forgotten by the time we get our first technicolour glimpse of Munchkinland. Of course, this is no major gripe, existing only as a small bonus on top of what is a near-unbeatable big screen experience.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review. If you're looking for a writer for your movie website or other publication, I'd also love to hear from you.*",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A magical movie that will not be forgotten.,"The unforgettable version of The Wizard of Oz, directed by creative Victor Fleming, performed by the legendary Judy Garland and supported by Frank Morgan, Billie Burke, Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr, and Jack Haley, among others. The proposal is immensely creative and limited for the time, but this is not perceived. From the Technicolor, outfits, makeup, scenery and effects are totally rich and never seen for those years. The story is concise, funny, dynamic, and very cute until today, it does not need anything. The musical numbers are beautiful as are the simple choreographies that accompany them.A fascinating cast with cartoony-appropriate performances. This film is by Judy, young and radiant with a freshness seen throughout the film singing and dancing accompanying her innocent performance.Film nominated for 5 Oscars in 1940 including 'Best Picture' and winning 'Best Music' and 'Best Original Song' for the beautiful and unforgettable ""Over the Rainbow"" performed by the sweet voice of Judy on the tape.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
OZ: A Grown Up's Movie That Kids Enjoy,"THE WIZARD OF OZ is a paradox: although made with a juvenile audience in mind, the completed film has an unexpectedly adult sensibility, and children enjoy it on one level while adults find it a considerably more complex experience. Like most fairy tales, OZ deals in archetypes--but instead of merely referencing them, OZ specifies them in a uniquely literal way and transforms them into a brilliantly beautiful yet extremely menacing tale of innocence lost. It is a surprisingly psychological film, and any one foolish enough to scratch its surface will soon find themselves dealing with more ""isms"" than a roomful of research psychiatrists could explain.Fancy ""isms"" aside, OZ is a tremendous amount of fun. For one thing, it MOVES: the story begins with a tone of breathless anticipation, and the film somehow manages to maintain that level of energy throughout its entire running time with never a lag. Although one or two of the famed special effects seem a bit dated, most are still exciting. This is particularly true of the famous tornado sequence, the first half of which (in which Dorothy races the storm home) still outstrips any special effects storm footage made to date. The look of the film, from the rich sepia tones of a painfully literal Kansas to the Technicolor vibrancy of a very surrealistic Oz, is as artful as a dozen famous painters rolled into one--and need we really mention the music, so famous that virtually every man, woman, and child in the western world can hum most of the score?But all of this would be by-the-way if not for a truly amazing cast. Judy Garland is a remarkable Dorothy, with one foot in innocent childhood wonder and the other as firmly planted in a very sophisticated and extremely adult sense of humor (watch her very subtle series of double-takes during the Munchkin sequence), and the success of the film largely rests upon the success of her own performance. But this in no way disparages the rest of the cast, which plays broadly but with considerable self-depreciating humor; every one is sure to have their own favorite among the famous performances by Bolger, Lahr, Haley, Hamilton, Burke, and Morgan, and all are equally brilliant.Although the original MGM DVD (now out of print) has been greatly praised, the Warner Bros. DVD is the widely available standard. Whatever its failings in comparison to the MGM DVD, it offers picture and sound quality far beyond anything seen on any VHS. There are also a number of extra bells and whistles that range from the very interesting, such as the Angela Lansbury-hosted documentary on the making of the film, to the ho-hum, such as old newspaper advertisements for the film. But whatever the merits of these extras, the real reason to buy the DVD is for the film itself: THE WIZARD OF OZ is as timeless, fascinating, disturbing, and beautiful today as it ever was and probably will always be. Put the kids to bed and watch the film with a critical eye--and you'll be amazed at what you've missed.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Classic Film.,"The film The Wonderful Wizard Of Oz came out in 1939. But I was not born until 1980. I saw the
tapes of the Hollywood Boulevard with Judy Garland. She has won a lot of trophy. Judy Garland was a outstanding actress just like Shirley Temple. When the Wonderful Wizard Of Oz had the movie premiere there was a big turn out. The film comes on television often and it's in the book store. I like Glinda the Good Witch. I say this since she can act and her costume is beautiful. But I feel she was look over alot. She was such a good asset but didn't get the recognition she deserved. She was attractive and her costume is well-made.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Still a classic,"I remembered watching this as a kid & watching it roughly 10-15 years later, it still held up as a classic. This may be because it reminded me of my childhood but I felt it was great. Judy Garland's portrayal of Dorothy is without a doubt one of the most iconic characters in cinema history. The cinematography was well done and I felt that for the time and technology, the editing in this movie was also well done.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A timeless classic that every cinephile NEEDS to see!,"The Wizard of Oz showed that Technicolor was becoming a booming phenomenon in Hollywood, that fantasy storytelling was becoming a seriously-taken form of art and escapism, and Judy Garland became a household name for all-time; and I didn't even mention 'Somewhere Over The Rainbow' yet. This film is a classic that EVERYONE deserves to see, especially if they claim to be a cinema lover.The Wizard of Oz is filled with classic moment after classic moment, iconic line after iconic line, and scenery that will be etched in your memory for years to come. Truly wonderful stuff that stays with you, and it's an all-ages wonder that is knowingly aware of fantasy's emotional scope of awe and investment.The Wizard of Oz has become a cinematic staple for good reason, and it's bound to stay that way for a long time. Also it's fantastic for the kids, too.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It still standing merely after 100 years,"Because of Wicked (which I haven't seen yet), I decided to see again the wonderful portrayal of The Wizard of Oz. The story is beautifully depicted, told, and executed, with its timeless themes of courage, friendship, and self-discovery resonating just as powerfully today as they did when it was first released. I especially love the movie's look and feel, its vibrant Technicolor scenes have a magical quality that remains captivating. Watching it with modern eyes, you notice how digital reproduction enhances the visual richness while preserving its charm. The songs and performances are incredible, with Judy Garland's iconic portrayal of Dorothy standing out as unforgettable. I also thoroughly enjoyed Ray Bolger's acting performance as the Scarecrow, his charm, humor, and graceful movements brought warmth and depth to the character, making him one of my favorites. The Wizard of Oz is truly a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
