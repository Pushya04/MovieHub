Possession switch,"I really liked the first Insidious and though it was suspenseful and creepy, after seeing Insidious: Chapter 2 I thought it was a good sequal taking place after the first.It was creepy and suspenseful and the acting from Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne and Lin Shaye were still really good also the child acting was pretty good.James Wan made a good sequal to a really good movie, the movie is a possession movie but it changes it up and does something new that works well.I won't spoil how the first Insidious movie ended just in case you haven't seen it, but I think this is worth watching like the first.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"James Wan continues his streak of solid horror flicks, and improves on Chapter 1.","Insidious brought us the usual haunting story, with a couple new  elements sprinkled in. Chapter 2 does a great job of furthering itself  from the usual fare, by expanding on the elements that made it  different.  One on the elements of this franchise is the focus on ""Astral  Projection"", which is a person subconsciously leaving his/her body and  traveling though a spirit realm (called the ""Further"" in this movie),  leaving the body empty until the soul returns. While projecting, the  soul can interact with other spirits, good and bad. Chapter 2 picks  right up from where the first ended (SPOILER FOR THE 1ST MOVIE! SKIP TO  NEXT PARAGRAPH TO AVOID!) - the father succeeds in rescuing his son's  soul, but something else has taken the father's body in the process.   Is it as scary as the first? That's debatable...if you liked the scares  from the first movie, then you'll get a kick out of some of the  tension- filled moments in this one. If you weren't a fan, then it'll  probably just be more of the same. My opinion - slightly fewer scary  moments, but definitely a few quality jumps, perhaps of a higher  quality than the first. (There's one 3-hit combo in particular that I  thought was really good.)  I will say that I enjoyed how the total story has evolved. Chapter 2  adds a few layers to the lore of this franchise that sparked my  interests, and gives it some good depth. The script is infinitely  better this time around. Patrick Wilson outdoes his previous  performance, and I love anything that Barbara Hershey does. We even get  a few laughs here and there. And James Wan does well to use the  'common-sense-as-viewers- applied-in-the-movie' technique again.  Without giving anything away...when you get a blatant warning, YOU  LISTEN TO IT.  Sound editing was much better this time around, although they still  rely a good amount on the usual dead silence broken by LOUD CRASHES OF  NOISE AND CREEPY MUSIC...  Overall, Chapter 2 makes several improvements on the first, and while,  depending on your tastes, this sequel may or may not be as scary as the  first, I think it's tough to deny that this is a all-around better,  more entertaining movie. And, being such a low-risk, low-budget  project, I'm sure a 3rd movie will be justified.  Insidious: Chapter 2 scores a 3.5 out of 5 on the BDBOS.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than the first? Could well be,"This could be one of those rare occasions where the sequel is actually better than the first movie. The linking back to the first movie was absolutely fantastic and the continuous suspense created through really kept you on the edge of your seat.I will say that this ideally needs to be watched right after the first movie as there is a lot of references that link back. But if you do this really is a great sequel.I mentioned the suspense and it really does keep you on the edge of your seat throughout, similar to the first installment in that I thought that the jump scares felt a bit too obvious, but it really keeps you in suspense from the get go.I thought the characters in the first felt a little boring, however in this one they all started to come into their own and it was all just well acted.With the plot essentially carrying on right where the first ended, i had doubts that it would be a little boring and maybe repetitive. But, it was a really engrossing storyline that had me wondering constantly.I do genuinely believe that this movie is a better watch than the first, just make sure you have recently watched the first.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Sequel That We Needed,"When I heard that they were making a sequel to this, I was both over-hyped with excitement and very nervous because let's face it, sequels rarely live up to the expectations of the originals. Thankfully though, this one did not disappoint (relative to the extent of other sequels).It starts off directly where the original left off, which is nice because there is not a huge time gap in-between. Not only do they continue chapter 2 right where the first chapter left off, but the story also goes more in-depth with Josh's past.Will every hard-core fan of Insidious be impressed by this sequel? Of course not. Insidious: Chapter 2 felt very different from the original. It was mostly because Insidious seemed more unique when it came out, while this chapter is more of the same with a few exceptions (e.g., possession). Without giving any major spoilers away, I will say that the last 30 minutes seemed more of a ""slasher"" movie than a paranormal movie, which may turn some hard-core Insidious fans away.The scares also seemed forced at times, possibly from trying too hard to make the sequel as good, if not, better than the original, but it was still suspenseful regardless.Overall 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Lackluster, timid version of the first.","There is something more frightening than any curse or apparition that resides in movies; it is the blight of terrible sequel, and Insidious: Chapter 2 is haunted by it. Audience would come and expect the same terror from the original, but sadly will only find inferior version of it, a formulaic possession horror flick with little charm and plenty of high pitch noises. To its credit, it does bring some good acting and direction. The script also works as a continuation, but perhaps because the mystery has dwindled; it only manages to be an average horror without the same chill its predecessor has.Story follows the events of Insidious where Josh Lambert (Patrick Wilson) returned with his son from the Further, an astral realm. However, an entity is believed to be latching onto him as the clairvoyance Elise Ranier (Lin Shaye) is found dead near him. His family grows restless from the apparent continuous haunting and ultimately tries to solve the problem despite the grim obstacles ahead. The plot is rather bland, there's simply a lack of tension as the terrorizing entity is somewhat predictable and plastic.Patrick Wilson delivers a good performance, he displays more variety of emotions to establish the dread. In some scenes he gives off cold enigmatic feel to puzzle the audience. Returning cast reprise their roles, Ross Bryne as Renai Lambert does a fine job, although her display of motherly concern at the first title was slightly better. The two ghost hunters are back, this time for more comedy relief than anything. There are probably too many humorous scenes, some are unintentional, in this sequel.Its use of music is cringe-worthy, in fact even with only the sound, it'd be quite terrifying. The scares don't have the same weight though, as they are reduced to simple bursts rather than real frightful ones. James Wan's camera angle is great; he casually makes the viewers think there might be more in scenes than there really are, especially with a hint of contrasting color, shadowy background or some objects in outer peripheral vision.The movie does poorly when the mystic of its entities is unveiled. Getting into fisticuffs with ghosts diminish the atmosphere since they seem unreal, part of me inadvertently immediately knew it's just make-up and sound effect put together for an illusion. Take away the jarring build up, replace it with mediocre possession scheme, even if the directing is well done, and you'll have a subpar sequel. It still performs its scare tricks decently, so at the very least it'll make you flinch a couple of times.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"If you were a fan of the first, you will love the second installment","The movie picks up right where the first left off, and really gives you the back story of the family and why they are going through everything they are going through. They style is very similar, and there is so much originality and style that you just don't see with today's modern horror story flicks. There are plenty of scares, plot twists, surprises, a-ha moments, and plenty of tense moments and horror. I really enjoyed it just as much as the first. I got to see The Ultimate Insidious Experience which was a back to back double feature which was really cool to refresh what had happened in the first. There are moments that explain cleverly scenes that didn't make sense in the beginning but are cleverly resolved in the end. I have always loved the first Insidious and the second is equally as good in my book. If you didn't like the first, you won't like the second. It's just a great spooky, scary, haunted house, ghost, abandoned hospital story that is well-done and leaves you very satisfied at the end. They leave it open for further sequels that are sure to follow. A definite must-see for any horror movie fan.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not as good as the first one but still a good Horror movie overall.,"Insidious Chapter 2.I really liked Insidious Chapter 1, it was a really good horror movie after a long time in my opinion. When I heard they were making a second part (no surprise there as part 1 ending suggested it clearly), I had some doubts because sequels of Horror movies ALWAYS suck. I'm glad this didn't follow the tradition.The story follows the previous part and all the cast is back. IT was good and answered some of the questions that were raised in the previous part. The horror stuff wasn't that much. Same goes for the atmosphere and tension. I really liked the fact that the two detectives were also back and they had some funny scenes too. Would be awesome if those two can get a whole movie.It wasn't as good as part 1 but still was a good horror movie. James wan sure is a savior of Horror movies in these times.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Lived up to the hype,"All week I was digging around trying to find critics' reviews about this to see what they thought at their early screenings. Well, it wasn't good, and I was feeling let down already. They all basically said the same thing; that the jump and scare moments were plenty, but that's about it. The story is too convoluted and it just isn't as good as the first one. Also, there is too much humor and wit in it, and it takes away from the tension buildup. But would that stop me from seeing it first chance I get Thursday night? As a die-hard of demon movies and of the first Insidious, nothing was going to stop me.When the movie opened with the original Insidious creepy sound of high-pitched instruments, I was very excited. I sat back and prepared to enjoy the ride. And did I ever. At the conclusion, I immediately knew that this installment was more horrifying than the first one. I'm not saying the story was better, or that it was written, acted, or any other cinema verb you could think of done better, because that's still up for debate. But what I knew for sure was that this was more terrifying than the first one. And that's the whole point of scary movies, right? To be terrified? A handful of the jump and scare moments will stick with you, that's for sure. Patrick Wilson did an amazing job, as he has done in his recent string of scary movies. While the two goofy underlings to Elise do bring humor to the table, I don't think it takes much away from the overall dread and terror. At least not as much as critics are saying it does. What I loved about this movie besides the scares, was that it tied together some things from the first one. I wasn't expecting that. You'll see what I'm talking about when you see it though. You'll probably say something along the lines of what I said when it was happening..""Wow, that was beautifully planned out and executed. Props to the writers there."" The story is more complicated than the first one, but if you can keep up, you'll really appreciate and enjoy it. And the complexity of it will make it a movie worth seeing multiple times in order to catch everything. Be prepared to jump a mile in your seat at some of the parts. Then laugh while your heart rate comes back down. I'm giving this a 9/10. But that is pretty biased because of my love of the first movie. So more realistically, 8/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Mostly a logically continuation that works well,"It's after the first movie and the police suspects Josh Lambert (Patrick Wilson) of killing the medium Elise Rainier. The police interrogates his wife Renai (Rose Byrne) about the night. Dalton seems to be normal but things are not right at home. It turns out that back in 1986, Elise had interviewed Josh, and Specs and Tucker rediscover the taped interview. Mother Lorraine (Barbara Hershey) sees a vision and everybody suspects there is a spirit. Josh refuses to acknowledge any of it except he is talking to an unseen person.This one misses Dalton in danger. Heck the kid is on the poster in the first one. There is something about a child in danger which raises the tension. That's why the best scene is the one with Dalton and the tin cans. When the string gets taut, that's a horror scene that I haven't seen before. It is a beautiful setup as if something is about to be pulled out of the closet. Patrick Wilson is great when he makes the switch. He's just as capable playing either side. The sequel follows logically from the original and works well for the most part. The other world is fascinating and very satisfying.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Things that go bump in the night,"When you are making a horror movie it always helps to have a few things around in the movie in order to help set the mood. Things like creaky old doors, a piano, and preferably an old and creepy looking house. Now these are not absolutes, but they can help for sure. Horror movies are not like other movies, because there are so many possibilities for sequels, just look at the ""Friday the 13th"" series. In 2011 James Wan and Leigh Whannell brought us ""Insidious"", a story about a family that had unwelcome visitors in their house. The supernatural kind.That family, the Lamberts, have gotten away from their house and the experience they had in it. Josh (Patrick Wilson), Renai (Rose Byrne), and their three children are all safe and move in with Josh's mom. At the beginning of the film you find out this is not Josh's fist experience with a sprit. It seems Josh has a gift where he sees dead people and with the help from Elise (Lin Shaye) he forgets that gift, until he uses it again to save his son from a place the living shouldn't be. That place I imagine is the same place Carol Anne from ""Poltergeist"" was in as well, but instead of talking through a TV, a tin can phone is used to communicate to the other side. Renai senses something is not right about Josh, a sentiment that is shared by Josh's mother as well. So with the help from a man named Carl (Steve Coulter) and two guys who provide the comic relief, they all set out to free Josh and his family from the evil that haunts them.The story picks up exactly where the first film ended, which makes the chapter 2 a perfect title. There are so many more possible chapters to this story, because let's face it there are a lot of ghosts out there. ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" is part ghost story and part detective story, as we try to unravel what is following the Lamberts around. Lucky, unlike what he did with ""Saw"" we are still under the direction of James Wan and he keeps us on the same path as the first film. If you are going for jump out of your seat frights, then this is not the film for you. There are some moments that may make you jump a little, thanks to some good camera work, but this movie is more like ""Seven"" than say, ""The Conjuring"". In a genre that seems to be getting everything right at the moment, ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" doesn't disappoint. The only thing that could improve, is to have a little less common sense moments, you know those moments where a character does the thing everyone knows they shouldn't. I think it is very fitting to release this film on Friday the 13th, because like that franchise, you hope this one also has a long life making us afraid to sleep with the lights off.Brian Taylorhttp://the2cinemen.blogspot.com/",,Anonymous,Horror
"Was as funny as it was scary and an OK movie, but doesn't live up to the first.","I have been looking forward to this movie the moment I heard about it. I loved the first one so much I saw it numerous times in theaters. This installment, Chapter 2, is sub-par in my opinion.If you have read some other reviews you'll already know plenty about this movie. The review saying that we're ""spoiled"", and gave this a 10/10 seems a bit off, but everyone is entitled to their own opinion. You'll already know that its ""scary moments"" are sort of forced, the ""ghosts"" are not as creative or as ""haunting"" as the first movie, and that this movie seemed to have some loop holes. All in All I thought it was average at best but had the audience laughing as much as they were screaming.This movie tried to be something it's not. You can tell they were influenced by movies such as Inception and Cabin in the Woods. It had some ""plot twists"" like Inception and laughs here and there like CITW. This is not a bad thing what-so ever, the only thing is, is that they didn't execute it as well as I'd hope. I wish they stayed original, while still having influences, like the first movie, and as scary as the original.As you will read in other reviews, this movie was very anti-climatic. To the point that after the ""climax"" you stood their asking yourself ""is it really the end? Or are they going to do some Cabin in the Woods ending where they go ALL OUT and things get CRAZY!"". But they never do.I also think this movie will be be given more thumbs down then up because it had a lot to live up to. The first movie literally had me crawled up in my chair. It was also so scary I brought my friends to go see it, to see their expressions! This movie had me feeling indifferent and telling my friends to not have high hopes.Now this movie had some things going for it as well. I thought that the comical parts were hilarious, just were out of their element. I also thought that they gave more screen time to more worthy characters. And lastly, the music was done by the same person who did the first, and that gave the movie the same scary, ominous, uneasy feelings.Overall I would say that if you liked the first one, this picks up right where the last one ended and it might not be ""worth seeing"" but you could spend your money in worse ways. Just don't expect another ""insidious"" or ""The Conjuring"". Enjoy!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Continuation,"This movie starts exactly where the other one left off. So it would make sense for you to have watched part 1. It does work without it, because everything gets sort of explained, but it would be better if you had the knowledge already while watching. The movie sets out and tries to get the viewers it had from part 1 and it does succeed.The really out there ending from part 1 gets referenced here and kinda mirrored, but what really works is the story and the scares it does deliver because of that. Some people criticized the actors, but I'd argue they are really good. Not because of their names, but because they can and do act in this one. Not as good as Conjuring, but far better than other horror movies (with or without blood ... this one being one of the latter).",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
I'm enjoying the series,"Although this review is only for Chapter 2, I am enjoying this series so far. I enjoyed the second instalment more than the first as I found the first movie way too similar to Poltergeist but much more PG. The second is no different in that there isn't the horror gore as there in others. This series is definitely aimed more at the teen audience than an adult one. These movies are just fun ghost stories but offer little in the way of jump scares if that's your thing. Some people will trash this movie just because it didn't make them soil themselves; others do have valid gripes (There is a massive plot hole In the beginning that doesn't get answered and besides being more realistic to real life when a murder occurs, is just left open.). Just enjoy the movie for what it's worth.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

HIGHLY entertaining :),"I loved this movie. Loved it, loved it, loved it. James Wan is one of the best directors of recent times and he makes his stand by offering two awesome horror movies this year. I personally preferred Insidious 2 though, as I appreciated the rich character development and the concept of the Further. There are clear references to The Shining and Psycho but this movie leaves its own mark of disturbing. Of course it's always great to add some light humor in between to dilute the scares (as they REALLY packed a punch in this second installment). So if you're kind of doubting the movie based on its bad rep, don't listen to the negative comments/reviews as this is easily one of the best movies this year. Everyone did a phenomenal job and the end product turned out a lot more satisfying than I expected.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Thank you for the err  clarifications.,"There exist three types of ""sequels"" in the horror movie industry Sequels in name only, which have absolutely nothing to do with the events of the original. Normal or regular sequels, which refer or build onward on the events of the original but can be enjoyed separately still. And then finally there are sequels, although a minority, which you simply cannot begin to watch without having seen the original because the story lines of both are interwoven. ""Insidious 2"" is such a sequel. Don't you just love it when they are making a sequel in order to clarify and explain the convoluted and twisted plot of the original, only to end up with two utterly complex and confusing movies instead of one! Preferably you should even watch ""chapter I"" and ""chapter II"" back-to-back to fully comprehend everything. I watched them with an interlude of a few years and really had to dig deep in my memories to remember the details of the first film. But hey, let's first state clear that ""Insidious 2"" is an admirable fright-and-jump movie from the talented duo Leigh Wannell and James Wan who already proved that they are masters of horror and easily capable to make the hairs in the back of your neck rise. The Lambert family is still being haunted by ghosts regardless of where they live, and they come to the surface via the spiritual mediums Josh and his oldest son Dalton. Elise, the medium that that helped them to save the life of Dalton in the first film died in the last seance, but it seems as if she's still trying to warn the Lamberts for dangers from the other side, and thus Josh's mother Lorraine seeks the help of her old friend Carl. Meanwhile the police are investigating Elise's death and, since they obviously don't believe in ghosts, they want to frame Josh for murder. The main trumps of ""Insidious 2"" are strong performances (Rose Byrne, Patrick Wilson, Lin Shaye and Barbara Hershey always give their finest performances when directed by James Wan), a very patient but extremely atmospheric and ominous building of suspense, genuinely petrifying shock moments that manage to grab you by the throat even though you can see them coming and a handful of intriguing sub plots. The parallel plot of Parker Crane and his petrifying shrew of a mother, for example, is truly fascinating and re-establishes once again that Wan and Whannell are creative writers.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Insidious sequel is spooky fun.,"Insidious: Chapter 2 starts up almost right after the original Insidious ended with Josh (Patrick Wilson) and Renai (Rose Byrne) Lambert reunited with their son Dalton (Ty Simpkins) after his spirit was held prisoner by a demon in an afterlife dimension called 'The Further'. But, as we saw in the final frames, something else was now inhabiting Josh's body and it had strangled paranormal investigator Elise (Lin Shaye) to death. We pick up as the unsuspecting family, including older son Foster (Andrew Astor) and their infant daughter Kali, have moved in with Josh's mother Lorraine (Barbara Hershey) while police investigate Elise's mysterious death in their house. They are barely moved in when supernatural occurrences start to begin again with objects moving, spectral voices, apparitions appearing and dear old dad acting very strange. While Renai tries to deal with the fact that supernatural forces are still with them, Josh tries to convince her all is well and Lorraine decides to team up with Elise's former assistants paranormal investigators Specs (Leigh Whannell who also wrote the screenplay) and Tucker (Angus Sampson) along with one of the original investigators from Josh's childhood haunting, Carl (Steve Coulter) to get down to the bottom of these haunted hi-jinx once and for all. And that is all I will say about the story as, despite some familiar trappings, James Wan (The Conjuring) takes this installment in some clever directions and once again uses the familiar elements very well. We get to know the story behind the evil woman in black seen in the last film and even revisit The Further though, this time it is inventively linked to events in the first film. The pace is a bit slower and more methodical this time round but, since this film is a bit of a mystery as well as haunting, it takes it's time to let the story unfold and secrets be revealed. We still get some spooky scenes but, it is refreshingly mixed in with Lorraine and co's equally goose bump inducing investigation. And what they find is deviously fun. The film is not quite as lively as Insidious part one but, I liked the mystery element and the film earned points with me for using it's return to 'The Further' a bit more clever and less silly then last time. That is the point where the first film lost it's grip on me and here I like how it was done and was with this supernatural chiller up to the spooky end. Wan is a good director and he takes what could have been a ho-hum retread and makes it a fun follow-up. He gets good performances out of all his cast and while I found Patrick Wilson to be bland in both Insidious and The Conjuring, he gets a far more lively performance out of him here. He gets to ham it up a bit and it suits him. The film has some beautiful and creepy visuals, as is Wan's trademark, and Joseph Bishara's score adds some nice atmosphere too. So in conclusion, while the story elements are more familiar; we've seen some of it before and the pace a bit slower, Wan does give us a spooky mystery to add to the paranormal activity and makes much more clever use of his otherworldly 'Further'. He also gives us some clever answers to the questions left by his first Insidious and that all adds up to a spooky fun time at the movies. Also stars House Of The Devil's Joceline Donahue as young Lorraine in some equally clever flashback sequences that tie into the rest of the film in a fun way.",,Anonymous,Horror
Watch it like a parody,"There were points in the movie where I was surprised, but never truly frightened.It's formulaic, it's predictable, and it's just plain not scary.Most movies use foreshadowing. They want to be clever and make us guess at what's coming. If the director is good at it, you'll either be misdirected for a bigger set-up or get just enough to find little bits and pieces of information that keep it interesting. No movie should let you figure out the plot from the clues unless you're Sherlock Holmes.But this movie practically ruins itself! The suspense was never there for me because it was given away by a veritable Reeses pieces trail. The director couldn't have done a worse job if he'd included small cut-scenes where he told you what to expect in the next scene. OK, that's a bit of an exaggeration, but you get the point.The reasons that I'm giving even giving this movie a 6 out of 10 are. 1. It has some new takes on overdone horror themes. 2. Because halfway through, I made the mental shift to enjoy this as a comedy adventure rather than a horror movie. It made it a lot more enjoyable when I lowered my expectations and shifted genres.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very entertaining,"For being PG-13, this movie was very good. It was funny, witty, suspenseful, and I thought the acting was fantastic. I was even moved at one point, almost tearing up. I personally loved the story--you can simply read the summary because I don't want to give anything away. At first it didn't make much sense but as the movie continued, different secrets unfolded and it was far easier to understand. The special effects were great as well and there were SO many pop outs! Sometimes in film they get tiresome, but I was always jumping with every clang and slam. It was a rather original concept and very well done in my opinion. I have yet to see a truly scary movie but this is by far one of the best I have seen.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than the first part!,"Rarely do we see sequels living up to people's expectancy, and it's even rarer to witness that continuation surpassing its precursor in terms of quality; ""Insidious - Chapter 2"" is one of those gleeful irregularities.The first part was satisfactory, but this second part performed much better in almost every respect.The scares were better seated, the story had more layers to depict, every character had a purpose to attend to, and most importantly the screenplay had more events to showcase; it was tighter and to the point, and it wasted no time in trivial details as it got right into the heart of the matter from the very first frame, I adored that.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Going back into the further,"Insidious was one of my favourite horror films in the past couple years. It was scary, thrilling and it stuck with me long after. Most horror films can no longer due this to an audience anymore. However horror master James Wan was up for the challenge and made two horror films this year 'The Conjuring' and 'Insidious chapter 2'. Many folks will compare these two films and debate which one is scarier. The Conjuring in my opinion was a well made horror film however it lacked the scares. The story was well done and the film did a great job of building tension however it was short on scares. Insidious chapter 2 has the opposite problem, it has the scares and tension however the story just gets ridiculous and weird as it moves fourth.Chapter 2 is a film that does not need to be made however James Wan felt he needed to continue the story and show us more of this horrible world. The film picks up exactly where Insidious left off. This will not be a friendly film for viewers that have not seen the first one. Chapter 2 flashes back and fourth from the first film and really much like the title this is chapter 2 in the story. Insidious chapter 2 starts off well enough and has many decent scares in the film, however the longer the film goes on the weirder and stranger it gets. James Wan is great with the camera work and scares once again however story telling this time around not so much.Many people complained about the 3 rd act in the original insidious because of the 'further' and so it should be known that this film centres around the 'further' for the majority of the film. Chapter 2 does a great job of making some connections to the previous film and offers some nice new surprises. However it's a shame the film falters under it's own weight.While not a great film by any means, it's not awful like some people would have you believe. Basically in my opinion if you liked the first film you will find something to enjoy here possibly. If you didn't like the first chapter then stay the hell away from this one. James Wan said he will not be returning to horror after this film, which is a shame as he is so great at it, so lets hope he is only taking a short break. Insidious does deserve better but honestly as far as sequels go you could do a lot worse. I had fun and even jumped quite a few times, so chapter 2 did it's purpose, however most viewers i feel will poke more fun at it then it deserves.Rating: 6 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Love versus evil,"It took me a while to watch 'Insidious' and its follow ups, with so much going on with my studies and commitments and with an ever growing watch and review list. Decided to finally watch them all, with the intent of reviewing the latest film as part of my quest to see as many 2018 films as possible and wanting to see how it compared with the previous outings. Also with an appreciation, if not quite undying love, for horror.Although there are people who understandably dislike it, found myself enjoying the first 'Insidious'. It didn't blow me away but it was well made and genuinely scary. So watched 'Insidious: Chapter 2' hoping it would be as good. 'Insidious: Chapter 2' for me was a watchable second entry but comparing it to the first, it is not as good and a disappointment in comparison. There are big drawbacks but there are good things here too.First and foremost, 'Insidious' llooks great, especially for horror films released in recent years (too many of which have looked like they were made on the schlocky cheap). It looks slick and stylish while having a spooky setting and suitably nightmarish lighting. The effects are also suitably eerie. Although a bit too loud in spots, the music is hauntingly atmospheric.James Wan directs with ease and real engagement and there are some genuine shocks and some creepy scares and dread. The first part is not as restrained as the first part of the first film, but when the film takes more time it is very effective. The acting, with the first film's cast returning, is good, with a particularly strong performance from Patrick Wilson. Did care for the characters, they were not ones that bored or frustrated me. The threat looks good and provides some eeriness.Regrettably, 'Insidious: Chapter 2' has drawbacks. It does lack tension and suspense and other scares are predictable and felt like throwing in as many horror elements as one can muster regardless of originality. Some of the film is on the dull side, while the second half gets far too camp and histrionic, towards the end things get so over-the-top and senseless that one is laughing rather than feeling scared.Moreover, 'Insidious: Chapter 2' fails to make sense and gets muddled in the latter stages, with an ending that's rushed, convoluted, silly and clichéd. The first film was derivative, this is even more so with the similarities to 'Psycho' and 'The Shining' being blatant and somehow not feeling like homages. The predictability factor is high and the script is also far worse here, very awkward and corny with some comedy that felt like it just didn't belong.Concluding, a watchable second entry but underwhelming. 5/10 Bethany Cox",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Brilliant Horror,"I went into this film with fairly high expectations. They clearly were not high enough. This easily matches, if not surpasses the first instalment. I loved the first film, and this is easily the best horror sequel I have ever seen.The storyline was fantastic, the slightly ambiguous ending of the first film was brought to light nicely, and a deeper more complex meaning behind the haunting was revealed. The full extent of the main plot line was given in chunks, so that I was always kept guessing, right up until the end.The actors played their roles well, child acting included. The roles were believable, and the characters were portrayed nicely.The main thing that makes this film (and the first) so good is that it is actually scary. There is hardly any violence, no blood, but they are some of the most jumpy films that I have seen. The lower budget effects are used simply and to great effect. The low key nature of the scares make them all the more believable.Overall this is a fantastic horror film, and matching the excellent original, if you haven't seen Insidious, see it so that you can see this! If you have seen Insidious, just see this!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Yawn,"Wouldn't say it's awful, there were one or two jumps in this movie... but it was a little bland and lacked the je ne sais quoi!!! Would recommend watching it once.... and then forgetting about it until Chapter 3 is out...I personally thought The Conjuring was a much better 2013 horror. Now that gave me creeps at night!!The comedy in the middle of the movie ruined it slightly!!! it was a little out of place and out of context.have a look at my reviews herehttp://www.chattytweety.com/2013/09/insidious-chapter-2.html",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Stupidious.,"Hideous, possibly. From the clunky voice-overs to the illogical ability of wandering the proverbial abandoned hospital, it's perfectly stupid.It seems like this was looking to break the record for the cheapest and weakest jump-scares to ever be put to film for centuries to come. Snore.",,Anonymous,Horror
What I Saw,"I'm not too familiar with James Wan and my memory of the first installment of Insidious is a bit hazy, considering that I've only watched it once because I found it funny when they decided to bring Darth Maul into the movie and use Tiny Tim music to set the tone of the atmosphere.Insidious: Chapter 2 is a lot better than what I had expected it to be. However, I felt like they recycled some of their 'jump scare' methods from the first film. Also, what made it annoying was the sound effects from the violin being played every five seconds as they try to force in as many jump scares as they can, making it seem forced and unneeded.They added comedic relief within the movie, which I applaud them for trying something different (but not unheard of). However, it felt like it didn't fit into the movie as well as I hoped it would be. As much as I enjoyed the comedic side, I would've valued it more if they somehow planned it more efficiently or played around with it a little bit more so that it wouldn't be as inconsistent with the tone of the film (which I understand is hard to incorporate, especially within a thriller/horror film).Insidious does well to add elements of action, making it consistent compared to most thriller/horror films. Overall, if you haven't, watch the first film before watching Chapter 2 because it picks up where the first film ended. It is a great sequel which I would highly recommend if you want to have a good thriller experience.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great way to connect to the original movie,I really like how the story very nicely jumps to its core without having to build too long. This is absolutely a great choice to take since the original movie did quite different than other horrors by leaving the audience with a great conflict potential. So in this movie it felt very tense all along this movie knowing that one of the characters is a menace in disguise. The acting overall is still just about the same job as did the original movie. Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson did just okay in their performances. It's very clear that the movie relies more on the jump-scares and less on good acting. But still I think this movie is better than the original since it flew right to its core and the overall suspense mood.,6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Filler sequel, offers nothing but closer to the first","Predictable, formulaic, and awkward at times- Insidious Chapter 2 is easily the worst installment in the franchise thus far- and serves as nothing more than an excuse to tie up loose ends than an actual movie. Some things I appreciated about this film was easily Barbara Hershey's performance throughout, as one of the oldest cast members, she still is able to hold her own as a main character and succeed despite the films problems with dialogue. Patrick Wilson is also very versatile in his performance as two different characters this time around, although he can tend to over-do it at times. I like the expansion of the films villain but it seems a bit too familiar to gain it any credit, and its methods of storytelling are incredibly cliche as well so it really isn't doing itself any favors. The cinematography is shaky and crude, a failed attempt to make the film feel more realistic with countless point of view shots that just seem too obvious to quite work at all. The actors portraying early versions of the characters on screen are also quite horrible, though most of the cast besides that is somewhat fine. It can be entertaining to watch at times, and despite some duller moments, still interesting. If you were a fan of the first film, you'll probably want to watch it to see how the story concludes- but needless to say, it could have been done a lot better.My Rating: 4.7/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Watch it with the first one back to back,This second chapter is as good as the first one and if the original movie experienced a major improvement in my latest viewing this one gets it as well.

Good But Not Great,"From Director James Wan comes a sequel to Insidious that on the surface could have been something just as good as the first film but falls short. I went into the theater expecting a film on par or better than part one of Insidious however I left feeling empty in that regard. However after taking time to think about the film while it is not as good as part one it is still a good film and better than most horror films that are released today.James Wan is without a doubt my favorite horror genre director today. He brought us Saw, Insidious part one, lesser known films but still great such as Dead Silence and Death Sentence, as well as The Conjuring which was released just under two months ago. He knows how to make a great film. With each new film he makes we get to see why he is such a great director. But this film is missing something. Surprisingly this is his first sequel that he ever directed. He has only written sequels in the past. And I would have to say this is his worst written sequel to date. Leigh Whannell also wrote this film and again this outing has to be his least interesting outing to date. But Whannell in my opinion just like Wan is the best at what he does in the horror genre today and that is write.The writing from writer Leigh Whannell and James Wan overall is not awful it is just not as good as previous works by these two men. Sequels aren't as easy to make and these two strive to make quality films all the time. However this film tries too hard and the outcome is not that good.The music in this film is amazing and it just feels like a classic horror film where you remember the music for ages. Wan and Whannell brought us Saw and that film has one of the all time classic scores ever. I wouldn't call the score in Insidious classic just yet but it is indeed memorable.The acting with the cast similar to part one is overall very good. Patrick Wilson pulls off some amazing work in this film. My only complaint in this department is Rose Byrne who doesn't seem she can act her way out of a paper bag let alone big screen movies.Overall this film is a step down from Insidious part one but still one of the better overall horror films considering the trashed that is released nowadays. If you are a fan of the first film don't set high expectations for the film and you will leave the theater enjoying this movie. Final rating 6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Was never going to be a great movie to be honest,"Warning – Spoilers ahead! ""Insidious 2"" was never going to be a great movie to be honest. Not that everyone loved the original, but those that did (Like me) liked it because it had a lot going on in it. It seemed seriously scary because there were at least a few movies worth of scares rolled into the one film. Were they really going to have enough left over for another one? Well, of course not!This sequel does once again have a lot going on in it, but none of it works. There's Patrick Wilson doing his best ""Shining"" bit, a couple of different ghosts that need a back story for some reason, a weird choice to turn one of the spooks from the first film into ""Norman Bates,"" time-travelling? and a couple of bits simply copied and pasted from ""Insidious 1."" There's also a lot of the usual toys rolling around, and loud bangs which lead to nothing, as you'd probably expect from a movie in which a family is terrorised by ghosts. Even though its happened to them before though, they still feel the need to go and investigate the said mysterious noises.Needless to say you will be completely lost if you haven't seen the first film, which you should be watching anyway seeing as its a million times better than this. If you can get past the fact that this family has knowingly moved into an equally haunted house to get over what happened in the first film, you will still be disappointed with the all-over-the-place feel, confusing plot, and lack of scares. I'm sorry to say that its even more un-intentionally hilarious than it is scary. Yes this was a hard one to pull off so perhaps they shouldn't of tried.Overall, it tries way to hard to be clever, when all I wanted it to be was straight forward scary. Very disappointing. Maybe they should of waited a couple more years to make something worthy, instead of spewing out this mess.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not As Effective as the First But Enjoyable,"Insidious: Chapter 2 (2013)** 1/2 (out of 4)The Lambert family tries to move on from the events in the previous film but it doesn't take long for them to realize that something from Josh's childhood is still haunting them. To me INSIDIOUS was one of the best horror movies in recent years thanks in large part to how downright creepy and effective it was. INSIDIOUS: CHAPTER 2 isn't nearly as successful in the scare department but it has an incredibly interesting structure that makes it worth viewing. I thought the actual story structure was the best thing going for this film as we pretty much have it starting up after the events of the first film. Instead of the story taking weeks or months for the hauntings to start, they happen right off the bat and within the matter of hours once the story continuation starts. I really liked how the story then split off into two with one group of characters dealing with one thing while the other group deals with the investigation as to what's going on. The way director James Wan went back and forth between these two sides was entertaining and certainly grabbed your attention. What didn't work in between these two sides was some extremely bad comic relief, which just stopped the film in its tracks every time it happened. As I said earlier, I really didn't find this film scary at all so compared to the original it falls well short. There were a few good moments where the atmosphere level was quite high but it still fell well short of being a classic. The performances were all extremely good with Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, Ty Simpkins and Lin Shaye in fine form. Barbara Hershey is also good here. INSIDIOUS: CHAPTER 2 takes its time in telling its story but this here is actually another plus. While far from perfect the film manages to be entertaining.",,Anonymous,Horror
A less scary improvement from the original instalment,"Any plot holes left by Insidious have been brilliantly addressed in the interesting sequel.The film picks up from where the first one left of. After the Lambert's son is rescued from another realm they mistakenly think they are safe from the evil forces that once haunted them.The film doesn't provide the same scares that the 2011 title provided but fills the holes that were previous left.The writing for the film is fascinating. Followers of the last film should be able to enjoy this film as it is far less frustrating.As a stand alone film Insidious: Chapter 2 may not work as the plots is complex thus you must watch the first film for the second to work.Patrick Wilson's performance as the father of the family Josh must be noted. He more than amends himself for his less than impressive performance in the previous film.Insidious: Chapter 2 is certainly fun film that will be better appreciated by horror enthusiasts. However, due to less scares casual audiences may disrespected by casual audiences.Another victory by director James Wan.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Spooky Less !!!,"Nail biting , nerve-breaking and curiosity is part of watching a horror movie. If you have tense moments engaged in any horror , then half of the director's job is done in scaring people. Insidious 2 fails to live up to the expectations raised by the director of The Conjuring and Saw.The Lambert family has moved to a new house but the ghost of the past is haunting them. The family must seek a way to fight off the evil before something serious happens in the house.Looking at the trailer of Insidious 2 made me excited about watching the movie, especially the first part had its share of scary moments. As the movie begin, not much justice has been done to spooky moments. The movie gives you tense moments but those are few in number to scare the hell out of you. James Wan is not in form this time. The process to create a haunting scenario is not upto the mark. The story is good but the screenplay is loose. Even the cinematography is ordinary. Performances by Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson is refreshing.Overall , I felt slight disappointed with spooky-less flick. Average 2.5/5",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Forced and uneven, The Conjuring was far more effective.","I saw this at an advanced screening in Toronto. I'm glad I saved my admission.I'll keep it short.It is less effective an both of its predecessors. Most of the scares are loud jump scares rather than atmospheric disruptions. The entire movie did not have the dread that was felt throughout The Conjuring.The filming was typical Wan, and the music was by the same composer as Insidious and features the same eerie string themes that worked well to keep you uncomfortable.The plot twists were forced and had several blatant loop holes.There are several unintentionally funny scenes in the latter half of the film.All in all:Did I get scared? Yes, about 3 times. All jump scares and made everyone in the theater scream.Did it last or will it last? No. Unless you haven't seen most of the genre. Again, I emphasize, it is not very effective as a horror piece from Wan. I expected this as he pushed out two films as opposed to his usual one. And honestly, I'm impressed at how he handled the plot because I had no idea how a full-length feature film could be developed from the last episode.Lastly...It makes a hint at another sequel at the end. It was very disappointing and I hope Wan isn't doing this out of studio pressure because he was just starting to mature as a strong gore-independent horror master, as a horror-lover it would be heartbreaking to see him regress.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

The first had some comedic moments but the scares were more effective. What really ruined the movie was the forced ending (i won't spoil it) just expect a third film at some point. Overall insidious chapter 2 is a hit and miss for me. Mainly being that they answered some questions I had from the first while raising new ones for a potentially third installment and the fact that they really expanded on the story, but also the story felt a little forced plus the huge cliffhanger of an ending ruined my experience.

How Does It Compare to the First?,"The Lambert Family moves to a new house to leave behind their terrifying experience with ghosts in the first house, only to learn that the spirits are not done with them and the mystery that connects them to the spirit world so strongly has not yet been solved.The original Insidious (2010) is one of the scariest films I've ever seen and I highly recommend it. It had cool old-school scares and some creepy violin music, making it a sort of homage to old ghost films. How did the sequel compare?In a lot of ways, Insidious: Chapter 2 resembles Kubrick's masterpiece The Shining. The plots have very similar features (and once you watch this film, you'll know what I'm talking about), and the cinematography in Insidious: Chapter 2 is very similar to The Shining, with all of their tracking shots, it just seems like The Shining with a twist.But I'm not saying this isn't a fun film. I actually enjoyed myself at this one and I think you are going to enjoy yourself at this one if you're a fan of the original because Chapter 2 definitely panders to the fans. The twist, especially, panders to people having previously viewed Insidious. I don't think it's as easy to enjoy yourself at this having not already seen Insidious, because most of the film relies on you having information based on what happened in the first film.The story in Insidious: Chapter 2 is pretty ridiculous but the actors really make it work, especially Patrick Wilson. He's a great actor and has given solid performances in everything I've seen him in. Rose Byrne gives an equally great performance as the mom, the sort of Shelley DuVall like character.The script was where I had most of my problems. There are sometimes one- liners by these two ghost-hunter guys that are trying to be funny but only just take you out of the moment and wrecked all the suspense previously building up. There were clichéd and cheesy moments but for the most part, they didn't take you out of the story.Insidious: Chapter 2 is a fun film to experience and I did enjoy myself. The performances were stellar and James Wan's reliance on old-school scares hasn't failed him so far.

The limitations of & the Model for what Horror Sequels can be.,"After the success of the first film (and the Conjuring), director James Wan and writer Leigh Whannell returns to the Insidious universe with the second chapter, with a bigger budget & better quality.Not only does Chapter 2 look better, it has better production values and better scares than the first one. Wan and Whannell are becoming more skilled & slick with the horror genre with this one. (We even get a glimpse of what a James Wan-directed Found Footage film would be like.) Scares are better, tension building is better and its hold longer. For the most part. The third act, while being still effective by maintaining the gloomy and foggy atmosphere and family drama, is bloated and does drag a bit. Also the Gonzo/Gothic crazy energy from the climax of the first film is a bit lacking. That being said, this feels like another rare case of great horror sequels. The script was also a standout, with its clever callbacks and links to the first one & even within this movie itself. It almost feels as if the story was conceived together with the first one. It feels like a story that wasn't forced, it was meant to happen This isn't a film that works only because of the directing. The shot of Elise letting Josh and Carl escape and smiling from the behind while disappearing will linger in my memory for a while. What an effective ending too!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A huge disappointment after The Conjuring,"Having seen the excellent, instant horror classic The Conjuring a few months ago I was looking forward to seeing James Wan's latest film. With that film, he seemed to tap into all of the classic shots and grades of truly disturbing horror movies, imbuing them with a timeless style that works beautifully. So I hoped for more of the same with Insidious 2.Unfortunately, this movie is just riddled with problems. It's hard to know where to start.The most atmosphere destroying aspect of the film is the comedy relief duo, including someone who wears glasses named ""Specs. It's difficult to understate how bad these guys are - they have no place in the film and apart from some unsubtle, sometimes slapstick humour, they bring nothing to the table at all. They look like American versions of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, which presumably was who they are supposed to be based on (ala Shaun of the Dead). This genre mashing does not work at all for what is for all intents and purposes a ""proper"" horror movie.While the film starts off relatively confidently (The old guy's acting leaves a lot to be desired in the first scene, and is the first clue that this is not going to be a great film), things deteriorate quite quickly, and while some scenes and sets are ""just right"", just as many feel very fake and the camera work and grading feels borderline amateur. It's surprising given the quality of Wan's other work but it feels like the producers have insisted on certain scenes/moments being delivered before they are really ready to go.The whole thing is full of plot holes and although the third act attempts to explain some mysteries from earlier in the film, for the most part there are far more moments that are ignored and make no sense at all.This is a terrible film. If I was James Wan I'd be embarrassed to have my name attached to it. I've been amazed at how consistently positive reviews have been and can only assume they are partly generated by studio shills as they are so far off the mark with their high praise. It is comically bad in places and certainly not the horror thrill ride Wan delivered in The Conjuring. Avoid.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

An acceptable and honorable sequel.,"I'm always afraid when I see a sequel to a movie that made success in the box office. Usually it never lends itself to anything. In this case, however, I think I make an exception. Despite not having even half the strength, impact and suspense of the first film, ""Insidious 2"" is far from a lost case. It maintains the cast, environment and history of the first film, to which he is umbilically linked, following up on his story and creating a kind of temporal paradox. I believe that this paradox, in which certain characters advance and recede in time, is an element that must have made a lot of confusion for some people, but I dealt well with it and even found it interesting. I think it fits the story well. In fact, the way both films intertwine is truly intelligent. Unfortunately, it ends up being a problem for those who did not see the first movie, because it does not understand part of what are watching. I did not really enjoy the way some characters tried to make humour and introduce some comic flashes in the movie. It is not a necessary feature, since this film does not have the tension and density that the first film had to spare. Concerning the performance of the actors there is little to add. What was said for the first film is for this one.

The family are back and still getting haunted. James Wan made the excellent The Conjuring and was clearly putting all of his effort into that. So maybe he was too focused on that to actually direct this film at all. The first was excellent; yet this is a laughably awful and heartbreakingly lazy follow up. It had the same cast, same good director and some good trailers. How did this happen? James Wan has a few filmmaking tricks up his sleeve, and there are a couple of good scares. The rest of the time, it's a long, boring slog towards a monumentally convoluted and clichéd conclusion. As toys go beep beep in the night, pianos play by themselves, ghosts shriek, people stand around and explain the plot, fog obscures everything and the ghosts do more shrieking, don loads of white face paint, do their best Captain Jack Sparrow impersonations and go ludicrously over the top I nearly switched it off. And I never turn films off once I've started.Insidious Chapter 2 is like an F grade film studies exercise where the task was to make the audience jump. The film is composed of jarring jump scares which drain the tension and at times the film is unintentionally hilarious. The script is dreadful: It consists of exposition, jump scares and.... that's it. The acting is awful as well and it is difficult to get behind the haunted family when all you want them to do is head to the nearest acting class. Virtually every aspect of it is lazy, clichéd and underwhelming. Every thing in this film has been seen before and there aren't any surprises. It doesn't even want to be its own movie. It spends a good chunk trying to tie up loose ends from the first film. IC2 is one of the worst horror sequels I've seen. It's probably not one of the worst as I haven't seen that many horror sequels but this is a waste of everyone's time. Rather offensively, a third installment is on the way and this has a 6.6 rating on IMDb. LAME.2/10",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Definitely gave me the creeps and I admit it did make me jump several times, but it isn't overly scary.","I really enjoy this film. It fits in so well with ""Insidious"" and I love how they tie in scenes from the first film. The plot in this movie is great because it makes things interesting and twisted while still keeping you in the loop of what's going on. The first film in the ""Insidious"" series makes so much more sense now because ""Insidious Chapter 2"" explains so much. I think the soundtrack for this film is awesome. All of the special effects noises are instrumentals are really loud, intense and gritty. They give this film a unique feel and it captures the horror in the movie perfectly. I think the cinematography and visuals in this movie are very powerful. The color choices are spot on. When in the spirit world, everything is given a subtle bluish-green hue and there is lots of fog, I think this is super cool because it shows the separation from reality in a way that is obvious, but not overdone. And since everything is a very similar color in the spirit realm scenes, the accents of bold colors stand out even more and create a dramatic effect.My favorite character is Josh Lambert played by Patrick Wilson. At first I didn't honestly like this character because I thought the acting was not very genuine which was odd because Patrick Wilson does an amazing job in the first movie, but soon I realized that this was on purpose. There's something new about this character, something a little off and it makes the film amazing. I think Patrick does an amazing job portraying these subtle changes in personality. I can't say much more about this though because I don't want to spoil the plot.Anyone who knows me knows I am a huge fan of the horror/thriller genre, and a sucker for supernatural films. Insidious Chapter 2 definitely gave me the creeps and I admit it did make me jump several times, but it wasn't overly scary. I give Insidious Chapter 2 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13+ because it's an intense film. So be sure to check it out in a theater near you!Reviewed by Raven D, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

Simple.,"I will keep it simple. Horrors by James Wan are my favorite. Watched The Conjuring series, Annabelle, The Nun. Didn't watch the La Bamba (💀) one, never saw it on TV in my country to be honest. 'Insidious' serie isn't one of his best (like I said, The Conjuring exists) but still, good watch. To be honest, I ain't a suitable person to write reviews, I just watch films/horrors/cartoons just to pass a time, I don't look if a horror has a good jumpscares (I am very easly scared), if a horror has a good storyline or dunno, characters have some personality, I just watch because I can and like I said, to pass a time. So yeah. This horror is a good watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Insidious: Chapter 2,"As horror films go, this one isn't at all bad, although there is the usual confusion with ghost/dream sequences. A psychic is murdered while trying to exorcise a ghost, apparently by someone or something from the other side. A boy is possessed, or has been possessed, or is he still now that he is a grown man with a family of his own? Part of the confusion is that this is a sequel. It turns out that the culprit is a serial killer who committed suicide by jumping out of a hospital window, and in turn he was under the influence of his mother who insisted on dressing him up as a girl.There are a couple of parapsychologists/ghost hunters involved, and what appears to be an attempt to inject a bit of comedy into the film, which fails dismally. Its real redeeming feature though is that there are some genuinely scary moments, not in the spook department necessarily, but like that time in ""Jaws"" when the shark turns up unexpectedly.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Insidious: Chapter 2 is scary, but isn't James Wan's best.","Check out my reviews on www.themovieboy77.comStaring: Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, Lin Shaye, Barbara Hershey, Steve Coulter, Angus Sampson and Leigh Whannell.Directed by: James WanInsidious: Chapter 2 takes place a short time after the incidents in the first film. Josh Lambert gets his son back from ""The Further"", a world full of ghosts and dark forces. Josh, however, starts acting weird and evil forces start to terrorize the family again. This time, there are a lot more twists and turns.The opening scene explains some more information of Josh's origins with the afterlife when he was a child, and things start to make more sense as the film goes along. The origins of the black veld bride are explained and you start to feel that the family is in danger as they try to solve the mystery to stop the haunting.The films scares are effective. The film has a ""haunted house"" feel to it, which is an aspect I love about horror movies. There are a few cheap jump scares, but the scares are mostly due to the intensity of the story. The tone of Insidious 2 is different from the first Insidious. The first insidious, while suspenseful, took time to ease you into the story, while Insidious 2 got right in your face from the get-go. The first Insidious was more about the family and the quest to get their son back, Insidious 2 is more about the afterlife and the origins behind the reasoning of the haunting. As things start to unravel, you feel more on the edge of your seat. You really start to feel that everybody is in danger.The whole movie plays out very well, but I felt the final act to be somewhat disappointing, and at points, comical. It had a bit of a ""Shining"" feel to it. I won't give it away, as the ending is the most important part of the film. Although, the twists were very well done. As you watch the film, you can't help but give a ""oh, that makes sense"" reaction.Patrick Wilson plays a more ""sinister"" Josh Lambert. I'm starting to become a fan of Patrick Wilson, who was also in James Wan's 'The Conjuring'. I enjoy his calming presence to the roles he's played in James Wan's films. He abandons his calming roots, and goes into a more angry character. He brought a lot of suspense to his scenes and, at times, made you hate him a little. I enjoyed the choice to give the afterlife more of a back story, and while some may find the origins a little comical, I find it to be quite haunting. Although, at times, the film seems a little too busy, jumping from story to story, making you feel a little lost as to what is happening.This is said to be James Wan's last horror film, which gives me a very bittersweet feeling. The guy is a great horror director, but it's great that he wants to branch out and do more things. To me, Insidious 2 is my least favourite from him, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it. It was a great continuation from the original, but after seeing The Conjuring, I know the man is capable of doing more than this. The film, sometimes, relies on cheap jump scares, which takes the affect away from the story being told. I've never felt that was the way James Wan wanted his horror movies to be portrayed. He is a great story telling, and doesn't need to rely on jump scares to be scary. I'm looking forward to seeing a lot more from him in different genres.Grade: B",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Rather dull,"Was rather dull.. Wasn't scary, the only part that was at all ""jumpy"" was the title screen that was unnecessarily loud and rather pointless in my opinion. The film didn't really pull me in and I found myself losing concentration waiting for something a little bit remotely exciting or scary to happen.

Horror at its best!!!!,I have always been a fan of horror movies. Slasher movies not so much usually because of the plot lack. In most cases horror movies always had the plot challenge. But Insidious chapter 2 had no problems.

"While it's slightly rushed and never quite as creepy as the first film, ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" is still a fun, suspenseful ride that has a lot of interesting ideas to explore.","""Insidious: Chapter 2"" was one of the more interesting viewing experiences I've had this year. I am an enormous fan of James Wan's first entry. I found it to be a surprising, eerie, well-made creepfest, and is one of the best supernatural thrillers I've seen in the past 10 years. And I thought Wan outdid himself with the absolutely wonderful ""The Conjuring"", which was an excellent film and a perfect haunted-house thrill ride. So I was wildly excited for Wan's follow-up, ""Insidious: Chapter 2."" Would it rival ""The Conjuring"" as one of Wan's best films? Would it be a good follow up to the original?The answers to those questions are a respective ""No"" and ""Yes."" It isn't quite able to match the masterful work Wan did in ""The Conjuring"", but I would ague that while not quite as good as the first chapter, ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" is definitely a worthy follow-up, with some fun scares and some really cool, interesting ideas that it explores.We pick up right after the first film- the Lambert family has recovered their son Dalton from the spirit world of ""The Further"", but paranormal medium/investigator Elise (Lin Shaye) has been murdered, and father Josh (Patrick Wilson) may or may not now be possessed by the malevolent spirit of the mysterious spectral woman from his past. With a police investigation ongoing, the family is forced to stay with Josh's mother Lorraine (Barbara Hershey) for the time being. However, Renai Lambert (Rose Byrne) and Dalton (Ty Simpkins) soon begin to once again experience supernatural phenomena, while Elise's former teammates (Leigh Whannell, Angus Sampson) work with Carl (Steve Coulter), a former colleague of hers, to unravel the mysteries of what is happening. And all will be forced to confront horrors and dangers if they hope to save Josh and the rest of the family from the dark spirits of The Further.The cast is a lot of fun for the most part. Wilson has a larger range to cover this time around, and for the most part is successful. (Although admittedly, he goes a bit over-the-top at times) Byrne, Hershey, Simpkins and the other members of the Lambert family all give wonderful performances, even though they tend to be relegated to screaming and running from the supernatural forces much of the time. Whannell and Sampson are a joy as they were before in their more broad comedic roles. And Coulter grounds the film as the investigative character who gives much of the rules and exposition.Wan's direction is once again top notch, especially for the low-budget nature of the two ""Insidious"" films. He is able to appropriately build mood and tension through wonderful shot compositions and his first class directions. The other facets of the production are also similarly wonderful, including some great, moody production design, and a fantastic score from returning composer Joseph Bishara. (Who sadly doesn't reprise his on-screen role as the Red-Faced Demon from the last film.)However, it is unfortunately an uneven script with some big pacing issues that brings this film down a few points from the fantastic 9 out of 10 I gave to the original film. The writing isn't bad... in fact the film does have a solid foundation and storyline, and it delves into many new and interesting ideas pertaining to The Further/The Spirit World. It's just highly flawed at times and suffers from having too break-neck a pace during certain segments. Whereas the first film was a much slower and more deliberate piece, that took its time to establish a mood, ""Chapter 2"" rushes, with a pace almost comparable to an action film. And as a result, less time is taken to establish development or atmosphere before the scares start, which did lessen their impact. Some of the scares and story segments also feel slightly contrived, and a few of the more interesting concepts are established but don't go anywhere particularly interesting. However, despite these issues, writer Leigh Whannell (who as mentioned above, also co-stars) is able to craft a satisfactory continuation of the story. I just wish he took his time.Overall, while it never quite reaches the first film's heights, ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" is still a spooky, fun ride with some really cool new concepts. And it is definitely a worthy sequel to the stellar original.I give it a pretty good 7 out of 10. Turn out the lights, lock the doors, and check it out for some creepy fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Predictable jump scares galore.,"The original ""Insidious"" on its own terms works well enough, but its repetitive, unimaginative sequel clearly verifies that director James Wan is overextending in the name of continuing a franchise. ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" isn't a total disaster, but it is a disappointment when compared to the first installment, and Wan's most recent success with ""The Conjuring"" (2013). Despite some clever plotting, interweaving the film's second half with events from the original, it simply lacks tension and falls short on scares.The opening prologue set almost 30 years prior, gives us a shadowy realm called the Further. In this place, the souls of the dead who refuse to accept their fate, and wander around searching for a way to reconnect with the real world. Following the prologue, events pick up right where the first movie ended. Josh (Patrick Wilson) has just rescued son Dalton (Ty Simpkins), whose spirit form had traveled away from his physical body, and is now trapped in a dimension not meant for the living. In their return to the real world, however, the same spectral presence that terrorized Josh as a child -- an old lady wearing a black veil in a wedding dress, has followed him back.With the present-day Elise (Lin Shaye) found strangled to death, Renai (Rose Byrne) cannot curb her intuition that husband Josh might have had something to do with it. She trusts him and doesn't believe he'd be capable of murder, but when she looks into his eyes she no longer recognizes the man she married. As forensic sends away tests on fingerprints, the Lambert family go to stay with Lorraine (Barbara Hershey), hoping the worst is behind them.What made the first film creepy and chilling is now all familiar material, and the addition of a back story infused with some artificial conflict isn't nearly enough to compensate for its lack of suspense. The storyline lacks structure leaving the movie noticeably uneven, and the plot ultimately becomes tiresome and convoluted. The ending is your typical, predictable sequel conclusion to keep the franchise going after Wan's exit. Inevitably, ""Insidious 3"" is only a matter of time, and it will continue to stretch a story that doesn't have much else to say.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Partitions in space,"We understand that the supernatural, what we call the supernatural anyway and identify as ghosts, has something to do with mind and conjured vision, this is why in so many of the films tools to that effect are central in the action: hypnosis, seance, memory, dreams and so forth. And yet the apparitions, insofar as we are faced with horror films, have to be understood in space itself, they can never be 'just a dream'.So for me two things are of importance.The handling of apparitions. Both this and the first film are very good in this regard, they have that concentration to a space already tense, charged, with the anticipation of something in it. We have all that staring into darkness, behind a door, in a dark corner of the room, inside a closet. Always effective when accompanied with the usual cues, this sets up in us the anticipation of presence.So simply as a horror film this counts as a success in my book and if you're looking for this spatial intensity it can reward.The other thing is the understanding of mind that subtends this space. This is let's say the ground from which the main action springs, and yet it can limit an otherwise fine film as much as a literal appearance of god can narrow a film on spiritual belief and transcendence.In both films we have a literal ghost dimension that souls coldly roam and our protagonist must traverse in order to defeat the evil spirit in its realm. We're shown here two levels, reality and spirit realm and a causal connection between the two. What happens in one literally has power to control the other. This oft encountered notion seems to rest on a misunderstanding of the subconscious as an actual 'zone' somewhere in the mind instead of much more likely the level of attentive consciousness I bring to mind.In this respect we have lots of mumbo jumbo here, topped by even a folding of time from the spirit realm!We have sadly no real masters working in this field, I say this as a lifelong fan of horror who'd like to see some innovative work. Talented filmmakers of space, Reygadas or Malick these days, Cassavetes earlier, likely find nothing of real value in the scare to go through the effort of preparing the space for it. But until someone with vision tries the subject, small films like this are all we have and almost enough to satisfy.",,Anonymous,Horror

Worthy Despite Its Flaws,"Insidious: Chapter 2 doesn't hold a candle to the original Insidious, but I don't think it's ever trying to recreate the glories of its predecessor.This film is a perfect representation of the talents of James Wan as a director, having a lot of fun with the IP he cultivated with the original film and stringing in a handful of fun homages to past iconic moments in horror history throughout.The plot of this sequel is much more in-depth than its predecessor, which was also a welcome addition although there were a handful of scenes that felt, arguably, drawn out far longer than they needed to be. However, it's forgivable for the experience as a whole when it comes to this movie.The true shining talents in this film, once again, are Patrick Wilson and Lin Shaye (although her role is much smaller in this film). It's always a joy to watch the those two absolute horror icons on the screen together any chance we get.Overall, Insidious: Chapter 2 is a far cry from Insidious, but it's still a fun horror movie and a worhty follow-up to the enormous Blockbuster hit.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

A strong follow up to Insidious,"There is a definite drop in quality between this and the first instalment, but Insidious Chapter 2 is still a pretty strong horror film.It picks up right where we left off from the first film with Renai still reeling from those final moments. From here the story progresses in a pretty interesting direction, as we learn more about The Further and investigate the past of some of the spirits we encounter.I do think at times it is a little repetitive of the first film, and could have been scarier in parts. There were also elements of the story that felt a bit messy and convoluted, and it definitely isn't as tight as the first film.Rose Byrne turns in a class performance and is matched well by Patrick Wilson, with the supporting cast all putting in solid performances.Despite not rising to the quality of the first, Insidious Chapter 2 is still very entertaining.

Solid filmmaking triumphs over the clichés,"Haunted house movies have become so similar and generic in their content and style, that's it's getting harder and harder to tell a good one from a bad one these days. ""Insidious Chapter 2"" strikes me as a fairly good one - at least up to a point. It's not that there's anything particularly groundbreaking or new about it; it's just that the level of filmmaking is a notch or two above what one frequently finds in the genre.Written by Leigh Wannell and directed by James Wan, ""Insidious Chapter 2"" follows the standard blueprint for films in this genre: a couple with young children finds itself bedeviled by restless spirits in an old Victorian house that, just from the looks of it, practically screams ""Haunted."" We're already familiar with most of the characters from the original ""Insidious,"" including Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson as the distraught parents and ""Entity"" star Barbara Hershey as the grandmother. There's the usual calling in of ghost-hunters and the standard mumbo-jumbo about ""the other side,"" but at least ""Insidious Chapter 2"" goes that extra step by actually entering into that alternate world and confronting the spirits residing therein.""Insidious Chapter 2"" is a bit too derivative of ""The Shining"" in the dad's seeming descent into madness and possession and his posing a threat to the safety of his family (a baseball bat and a fire extinguisher have replaced the ax in the earlier picture as the weapon of choice here). And even though the movie wanders off into some pretty goofy territory in its second half, the excellent cinematography, imagery and sound effects manage to keep the fright meter in the red zone for most of the duration.And credit those who made the film for having the good taste to include a brief clip of Herk Harvey's seminal 1962 classic ""Carnival of Souls,"" one of the creepiest horror films of all time, playing on a TV nearby.

Worst theatrical horror movie of 2013,"If you asked your local theater for tickets to the new James Wan directed, Patrick Wilson horror movie, I hope they directed you to The Conjuring. Otherwise, you went to see this completely unoriginal, poorly acted, unintentionally funny mess. James Wan had clearly stretched himself thin with two similarly plotted movies in the same year. Besides the usual haunted house clichés: dolls, Victorians, pianos; and the hallmarks of the bad horror movie (crashingly loud noises where genuine scares should be), this script outright rips off elements of The Shining, Sleepaway Camp and Amityville Horror. And because it is a sequel, it can't even claim to have an original idea of its own. The staging of a climactic scene is so similar to The Shining, I was surprised Patrick Wilson did not do the ""Here's Johnny!"" line. In the last minute, Wan even manages a final rip off by using the exact ghost sound effect from Ju-On/The Grudge. Patrick Wilson is typically neither good nor bad, but he's well beyond his range here. And Danielle Bisutti, as the villainess, is doing an impression of Faye Dunaway in Mommie Dearest without the fun factor. That's when she's allowed to speak, and not shriek into an echo chamber for one of the movie's many loud jump scares. I have seen virtually every theatrical or direct to video horror movie this year, except The Last Exorcism 2 and Carrie. Either one of them could be worse than this, but I doubt it. The current 6.9 rating astounds me, since so few horror movies ever get above a 6. This is not the one to break that mold.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Spooky excellence,"The movie picks up where the prequel, Insidious (2010) ended.

Insidious: Chapter 2's action eases you into the supernatural horrors in the same fashion as the prequel, and once it starts, it doesn't stop.

The sequel is better than the original,"I've become quite disillusioned by American horror movies. The glory days of your Evil Deads and Halloweens is long gone – the horror cinema we tend to see nowadays likes to rely more on cheap shocks than sustained terror. And in the off chance that a film comes along that is actually very scary (see: Saw and Paranormal Activity), it is buried into the ground after becoming a lacklustre franchise (see: Saw and Paranormal Activity). It looks like Insidious might be adding itself to the latter.Insidious: Chapter 2 picks up where the first one left off (so you might want to watch that first). It's the day after the night before, and everyone's a little bit shaken up. Husband Josh (Patrick Wilson) and wife Renai (Rose Byrne) think all their troubles are behind them, but all the hauntings and demons they thought they'd gotten rid of are still around. To uncover the issue, they have to go all the way back to Josh's childhood for answers.The problem with the first Insidious was that it was ridiculously disjointed. It was a fantastic first half of genuine terror and suspense, and an absurd second half of weirdly painted 'demons' and hokey plot points. Thankfully, writer Leigh Whannell sorts things out and we have a film with much more structure and narrative. Because it kicks off the day after the first one, we're thrust into it immediately. There's no need for the slow-burn set-up this time, which I think is both an advantage and a detriment.The advantage is that we go into fifth gear right from the start, so you always remain engaged. The detriment is that, sadly, Chapter 2 just isn't as scary as the first one. Yes, there are still those shocks when things appear suddenly; and they still generate a gasp, but it's just not as consistent. Chapter 2 isn't really about wanting to make you scared; I'd argue that it's really just about trying to make sense of the whole story. There is nothing wrong with that, and I think it's all explained quite competently, but that need to explain everything means the horror suffers.One other place where the second one trumps the first is the cast. Okay, so it's more or less the same cast as the second, but they're used much better here. Rose Byrne is as strong here as she is in the first, there's neither a drop or increase in quality. The quality increase comes from Patrick Wilson. I didn't really like him much in the first one, but he has more to work with here and does a good job. However, the best decision the filmmakers made was to make more use of Specs and Tucker. The double act are fantastic in their short stint in the first film, and are deservedly given more airtime in the sequel. Once again, they make the most of it.What bothered me most about Insidious: Chapter 2, though, is the ending. I won't tell you how the film develops, because it's impossible to do so without spoiling anything. However, I don't think it's really a spoiler to tell you that there will be a third film. Because, come on, they're all franchises now. And it's a shame, because it's inevitable that the quality level will drop with each new sequel that is made.But, let's not look to the future, and remain in the present. You should watch this accomplished horror movie, which is perhaps a bit short of spooks but is strong in character development and story progression.

embarrassingly terrible,"I love the two actors, Patrick and Rose, but the script here is so terrible, even they cannot make it believable, good, funny, scary, any of the things they were going for.This is like WHAT NOT TO DO IN A SCRIPT - exposition everywhere, incoherent story line and scares that don't come close to the first one (which wasn't great, but was good).Whoever job it was at quality control central, making sure the dialogue was believable, the directing was passable, had certainly taken one too many Quaaludes.Avoid at all costs.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Amazing Movie, Better than the first! Must Watch!","This is my first review and I am here to encourage everybody to go see this movie. I got scared few times, and I never get scared. I never got scared during Insidious or The Conjuring. Not scared like this anyways. At one part especially I had goosebumps that lasted for over a minute and I was thinking to myself ""That has never happened to me before"".You might not love it as much as me, but there is no way you can walk out of the theater and be disappointed. At the very least you would still be like ""Worth a watch!"" I had a great time throughout the whole movie. You would think that the sequel wouldn't be good as the original, especially since the original was so good. But I actually thought it was better. It was funnier and scarier.",,Anonymous,Horror
decent movie!!!!,"Since having seen Insidious 2, my review of the original Insidious has felt like a question mark.The Second Chapter is actually a good-to-great film.. Being completely frank, it's as good as the original Conjuring. The story is as smart, the development of the horror is as well-executed as the first, and it's as memorable.However, as far as not helping the original Insidious, because any sequel should be about serving what's come before, Insidious 2 needs to be put into this context: relative to itself, its plot twist works, yet ironically, the quality of the twist takes away from the power of the first film.The pivotal plot point of Wan's first Insidious is the revelation surrounding Josh. The history of his childhood, and the fact that he was no different from his own son's experiences.More crucially, Josh, on the verge of just having totally saved his son, finally gets to encounter the boogeyman of his own past: the old woman.Josh, the representative of modernity, who dresses to represent progression and intelligence, and whose very essence is the reflection of where life is meant to go, is suddenly at odds with a being who is his exact opposite.Just on the opposite of the mirror, the old woman doesn't say anything - she knows she doesn't need to, just due to her ability to intimidate through her very being.At its own service, because it is a great film, Insidious 2 nevertheless destroys the essence of the horror of the original film.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A step down, but it is still a more than solid effort","'Insidious: Chapter 2' keeps the level of the film series so far to a suitable level, though it is some way off its predecessor.The film, as you'd probably expect, relies heavily on the 2010 production, with quite a few reused scenes from it - even some from early in this one, too. It is with good reason, as it splices fairly well into what occurs here. I think they do try a little too hard with it in parts, though all in all it comes out decently.They sideline Rose Byrne for a lot of this, which is disappointing given she's arguably the best at acting of those involved. I assume it's down to scheduling conflicts with other commitments, if so it's nice she still appears.Due to the aforementioned, Patrick Wilson takes centre stage - not to great appraisal unfortunately. I find his performance quite inferior, at least compared to the one he gives in 'Insidious'. None of the others stand out, though I do appreciate them retaining the same onscreen people.This is certainly a step down, but it is still a more than solid effort.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sequel to the best horror film I have seen,"The Insidious Series has something not a lot of horror films have had and that is a creative curiosity arousing storyline. The first Insidious was one of the most riveting films I have seen. It shook the very foundation of my understanding of my senses and truly showed me what my body is to do and how it is to react to FEAR. Maybe I have never known Fear the way i did after watching Insidious.Insidious 2 takes off from where the first one left but the overall effect is short of being called overwhelming. Yes, it is definitely scary and more or less in the same prose but I couldn't help feel this isn't James Wan at his best.Having said that, the rating on IMDb is perfect right now for the film. It is still many notches more scary than anything else I have seen released recently.The Conjuring and Insidious remain his best films with this at third.James Wan has opened up the horror genre for me the way Walking Dead opened up the zombie genre. So this is what the world has come to :)",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
does this stand up to the original or is it a convoluted mess?,"The original insidious is a modern masterpiece in the horror genre. While its technicals can be rooted back to other movies- it is still an impressive work that shouldn't be missed by any horror fan. Now a a sequel would be hard work- but this movie came out a few months after the conjuring- a film even scarier than the first insidious that is just as good if not better. Now I'm not going into the technicals of those films because I want to talk about this film. But it is impossible not to at least get an idea of those films before talking about this. So Insidious chapter 2 actually starts with a flashback to Josh's problems being diagnosed by Elise before it picks up immediately where the original left off. Now the story here is the biggest part of the movie- but I can't go too deep without giving spoilers. But as it is it actually mostly works. A common complaint against this movie is that it's confusing and convoluted- and I am going to admit there are scenes that are like this, but the story as a whole does make sense. The story is for sure on a larger scale than the original but that's not a bad thing. It also follows the only route it could have taken after the ending of the original. Actually in a lot of respects thanks to the story this actually is almost better than the original. But as I said there are still problems and yes they do hold this movie down. There are a few scenes, and events that don't make sense, and since this movie is about finding answers it really hurts when a few important points simply don't get explained. If I can I may do a second review where I go into these details but as of now I don't think I'm ready to explain something like that. Anyways, there is one other problem- and that this film attempts to add comedy through the spec characters. I don't even know why comedy was written into this movie- and it is VERY out of place when it happens (well there is one funny line but it's at the end and isn't even delivered by either spec). I wound up choosing to ignore this part of the movie, but I know other people won't be able to. Now the horror scenes in the movie are on par with the original (there are some jump scare Esq scenes, but the movie doesn't rely on them). Some of the imagery is actually really creepy and fits nicely. Not only that the performances are also really good- especially Patrick Wilson, who really showcases a lot of talent here. Overall this movie mostly works but gets stuck on some roadblocks it could have easily avoided. I feel I can't do this movie's successes and failings without spoiling anything. So I guess the best thing to do is watch this movie for yourself and make your own judgments.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
When One Movie isn't Enough to Fix It,"I'm the perfect target for scary movies. I get real jumpy and freaked out with just about anything following long, silent dramatic pauses. Then, throw some kids in the mix and I'm on permanent hair-raised mode. Some of the scariest movies to me were Poltergeist, The Ring and Paranormal Activity. All of them had freaky occurrences with children... yikes!Insidious Chapter 2 followed the same mold as the first one, which had me shrinking in my chair. Ghosts appearing out of no where, children in peril and sleep being an issue. The spirit that inhabited Josh Lambert (Patrick Wilson) at the end of Insidious is the antagonist in Chapter 2. It is not satisfied with simply occupying a live body it wants to do a lot more heinous things.The movie tied together past and present pretty well and kept a cohesive story. Like any scary movie there have to be clues to exorcising the demons or figuring out what the malevolent entity wants. It seems like Insidious has found itself a nice little franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Further,"Greetings again from the darkness. This is a perfect example of why it's acceptable for writing standards to be lowered for horror films. This isn't science fiction or history. We are in the theatre for one simple reason ... we want to be frightened (to jump in our seats). Two years after the first Insidious, director and co-writer James Wan, screenwriter Leigh Whannell and producer Oren Peli, re-team for this sequel. It's also just a few months after Mr. Wan's very successful and well-made The Conjuring.I enjoyed the first one because there was a nice story that borrowed a bit from Poltergeist and some other horror classics. In a rare treat, Wan and Whannel actually tie in the sequel to the story from the first. Sure, some of it is a stretch with all of the parallel dimensions and multiple entities, but for the most part, it works and provides some nice thrills and chills.An especially nice surprise is the creative return of Lin Shaye as Elise, who stole all her scenes in the first entry. While the voice over of her ""younger"" scenes was distracting, her screen presence helps hold the final act together. Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, Ty Simpkins and Barbara Hershey are back as the family Lambert ... and this time we get more backstory on why the family seems unable to escape the demons.Wan, Whannell and Peli have done a very nice job of rejuvenating the horror genre, while still including the traditional fun of active closets, abandoned hospitals, creaky doors and musty basements. A certain amount of suspension of disbelief is required, but if you are looking for some scary fun, you could do much worse than the two Insidious films.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"One of those oh, okay it makes sense now that it's over","Let me start by saying, this movie doesn't make much sense at all until the finale. Josh's peculiar behaviour throughout the film is not scary, but rather annoying. His denial of their fears, while the theatrics are lame, irritate me greatly. The piano playing by itself, the baby walker going off by itself... lame scares. I looked to enjoy the film and as I write this; the movie plays as a rental in the background. My boyfriend likes it after we watched it in the theater. I fell asleep then, I will do the same once I submit this review. This time, it will be more acceptable. I'm on my own couch rather than the lounge chair of the cineplex and we paid $1.00 for the rental from Red box rather than $30+ for the theatrical experience.

A SePre-quel,"I quite liked this one for many reasons, one of which being its mix of sequel and prequel. I quite enjoyed how this picked up where the first movie left off and there was no ""six months later"" or anything like that. It jumped right back into the story where we stopped while also simultaneously giving us background to the previous story that we didn't know. The details and intricacies in which they correlated this part of the story back to the original and cleverly interwove it into what we already experienced and knew from the previous without it being too extra or convoluted was something that I definitely enjoyed and appreciated. It kept the same vibe as the original but I think it relied a little bit more on jump scares but still retained a lot of its creepiness. It's rare a sequel lives up to the original but think this one accomplished that. Would recommend.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Chapter 2,Insidious Chapter 2 was a decent continuation from the original movie. There were some really cool connection points with the first story which offered more color and context but I felt like it took too long to reach some of them.

Ominously Fun,"James Wan is on a hot streak this summer. After the success of July's ""The Conjuring"", he returns to deliver more thrills in ""Insidious: Chapter 2"", the sequel to the horrifying ""Insidious"". It may not compare to ""The Conjuring"", but ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" is also definitely a thrilling experience.The main characters from the first film are back and the story picks up directly from the end of the first film. The Lambert family are back and the target of hauntings again. Patric Wilson is back as the head of the family, Josh Lambert and Rose Byrne is back as Renai Lambert. The kids are also back and even Specs and Tuckrr are back. The only new members are the new ghosts.The story is similar to the first one, about astral projections. This time, it's the dad. They move to Lorraine's (Josh's mother) home to stay and strange occurrences still happen; the piano playing by itself, the baby's toy turning on by itself. Then they connect it to a mysterious person and it gets creepy.The film is quite interesting. The flashbacks and background stories are intriguing and creepy. But what made the movie succeed was its shocks. The movie is skillful in producing scares and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The music was well-done too and provided quite the tension. The performances were also not too shabby and well-done.However, what I felt was that kind of got repetitive towards the end. It was definitely formulaic and therefore, in the end, it got kind of annoying. In the end, the conclusion was nothing surprising and therefore played out normally. The last scene was quite expected and it's not surprising that the third installment is in the works right now.But overall, ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" is quite a fun experience and it delivers quite enough shocks to satisfy horror fans. It may not surpass the freshness of the first film but ""Chapter 2"" is quite satisfying.Rating: 6/10Final Verdict: Not a huge accomplishment, but ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" is a fun horror flick with an adequate amount of scares and is quite creepy.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

It's actually pretty decent, it has some good atmosphere and scares - well at least until we get to the end where things go magic fighting in magic land.But the thing that totally makes the movie all but unwatchable, is the sound balance. Why would I pay to watch a movie where I can either hear the talking and have my hearing damaged by sound effects or just turn off the sound all together? Why would you do that?This seems to be a running problem with this movie franchise so I'd just not watch these at all, maybe if you can get them on a dvd things might be better but streaming seems to be a no go.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

Better then most horror movies that come out but not the first one. Yet another sequel that falls short of its predecessor.,"""I went into that place to get our son back and something followed me and killed Elise, you saw it."" After Josh Lambert (Wilson) goes into the spirit world to save his son he is shocked when he finds that this event causes the death of the woman trying to help them. When his wife Renai (Byrne) questions what happened she notices a change in Josh. This change begins to effect the entire family and when a group arrives to help the family begins to experience the terror over again. I have stated that it takes a lot to scare me. I'm not saying that to brag I'm just saying that very few movies have scared me. The three that come to mind are Poltergeist, The Exorcism of Emily Rose and the first Insidious. That said I was hesitant to see this one because I was worried I would be scared again. On the plus side I wasn't scared at all, on the down side I wasn't entertained by this movie either. The first one was scary to me because of the possession of the little boy and creepy kids scare me a lot. Without trying to give too much away this movie was almost the same thing as the first one but this time Josh was possessed, and because it was an adult acting that way it didn't have the same effect on me. It felt just like another possession movie. I will say that this is still much better then most horror movies that come out but this is no where as good as the first one.

Good But Not As Good As The Original,"This film was an excellent movie, although it didn't meet up to the standards of the original. I loved this movie but the problem was I just couldn't stand the fact that it was worse than the original. I hated the ending it was unbelievably daft. The jump scares were slightly better than the originals, but they didn't scare me as much as the originals did. I wanted to like the film more than I did, but it would be better if they had a redeeming story line. Continuing the story on from the end of the original was a good idea, but having the Main protagonist being stuck in the 'Further' just wasn't the best of ideas, and then having him escape at the end... It was just a massive let down. I would have much preferred the film going on with the main protagonist in real life and not stuck in 'The Further' for the entire movie.

Insidious Chapter 2 continues the eerie creepy atmosphere that it's predecessor delicately crafted.,"It's not often you get a sequel, particularly in horror, that is nearly as good as the original. For me, this sequel did the trick. Continuing straight where the last film left off, the Lambert family are still being terrified and so they attempt to find out who is really haunting them and finish this once and for all. As with any instalment in this franchise, we have jumps scares galore, ghostly spirits in questionable fashion attire and plenty of backhanding (seriously this ghost smacks everyone). The story gets slightly convoluted and confusing for the sake of continuity, doesn't work all the time...to the point where it's paradoxical. Whilst the majority of the scares are predictable and just loud noises, the film took more of a thriller approach rather than a straight up horror flick. In my opinion, this worked better. James Wan knew not to compete with the first instalment and so he took the franchise in a different direction, and it worked. Particularly towards the end where there are moments of real tension. The Lambert family go through a lot, I mean any other family would go ""nope. Nope I'm out of here."" and just keep running away. So the scares, pretty much the same as the first film. Ghostly figures, noises from the baby monitor, piano mysteriously playing and one heck of an annoying child's toy/buggy/pram/whatever the flip it is. Problem is, whenever these scenes occur the actual jump scare is followed by a loud concoction of string instruments and you're actually more scared of that then what's on screen. The musical score is consistently good though, I mean those violins still give me nightmares. All the performances were good once again, always have a soft spot for Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne. James Wan is the king of modern horror, his slow tracking and panning shots are fantastic...add in ghosts hiding in the background and it just heightens the experience. This is a good horror sequel, which is rare for me to say these days.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not as strong as #1, but still good","Insidious Chapter 2 (2013) is not to the quality level of the first movie. I'll just start out by saying that, because it's true that the first is stronger, but that doesn't mean that this sequel isn't still good. This sequel picks up exactly where the first one left off. So make sure and watch the first one first. So if you've seen the first one, then you'll know that the first one ends with the death of Lin Shaye's character, death by Patrick Wilsons character. We don't know how it's possible that this could happen, everything seemed completely fine and then he strangles her to death after she takes his picture for some unknown reason. This movie is all about finding out why he did such a horrible thing and the backstory that goes into all that. The reasoning and backstory is all very interesting and that's what will keep the audiences attention throughout. I loved the acting in this movie, all the previous actors reprise their roles here and they all do well, just as they did previously. The writing isn't quite as solid as the first movie, but the places where the writing in this one gets good is when everything is being explained. Why Patrick Wilsons character, josh, seems almost possessed and how exactly all that happened. There are several scenes that are genuinely scary and will very likely frighten just about anyone, so horror fans will not be disappointed. Overall, this is an entertaining scary installment in the insidious movie franchise. 7/10 for Insidious Chapter 2.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Ghost House Masterpiece,"Walking into the cinema late at night on Friday the 13th to watch the sequel to James Wan's terrifying haunted house movie Insidious, I was wondering if this movie will live up to the expectation of the first and It certainly did in crap your pants fashion.The first insidious is one of my favourite haunted house movies about a family who are haunted by unexplained spirits after their eldest son Dalton (Ty Simpkins) went into some kind of coma which doctors cannot explain. But the parents Renai (Rose Bryne) and Josh (Patrick Wilson) are told by a median who has connections to a spiritual world that it's not the house that's haunted, it's their son and his spirit is lost in a spiritual world and they have to find a way to get him back.Insidious: Chapter 2 was made in a different style with twists and turns that the audience will not be expecting.The story of the sequel is the haunted Lambert family move in with Josh's mother at her house where 30 years ago a young Josh was experiencing the same kind of disturbances and hauntings. With new characters and twists in the story, Insidious: Chapter 2 introduces new evil spirits, old ones and a disturbing twist which left me and most of the audience shaking after the movie finished.Directed by James Wan, who has already made himself an iconic horror movie director with recent success' including the Saw series, Dead Silence and his newest and probably best horror movie The Conjuring, has done it again in this brilliant ghost house masterpiece after the success of the first instalment.On the opening weekend Insidious: Chapter 2 smashed the box office with $20 million, and after the weekend finished, it saw a budget of $41 million record at the box office. Which just proves that it is the ultimate ghost house movie.With passionate acting, plenty of jump scares, plenty of lasting scares and a new twist in the story which makes this the ultimate ghost house masterpiece.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Apparently not necessary, Chapter 2 adds new layers the story of the Lambert family and its ghosts and will please lovers of the genre","After the good prologue, we return to the events of the previous movie. A few hours after the end of Insidious, in which he dealt with demons and hauntings, adult Josh (Patrick Wilson) moves into his mother's house in an attempt to resume a normal life with his wife Renai (Rose Byrne, Extermination 2) and the couple's three children. But the return of the boy from beyond, the dimension visited during the screenings, still does not mean peace - someone (or something?) has escaped this exile and has plans for the Lambert family.Here again we have the well-known technique of James Wan, with camera walking through deserted and dark places, houses producing creaking sounds in almost every room, scares with figures dressed in character, origin of evil linked to a parallel world, but it allows itself change the focus. It is natural that a horror movie sequence changes a little from the formula presented in the first one, but success is almost never achieved, since the script of these productions is almost always very weak. The surprise effect has already been lost with the original episode and it is necessary to tinker with the formula. The merit for not having happened with Insidious 2 is the maintenance of the good creative team, especially the screenwriter Leigh Whannell, who had already worked with Wan on Death Screams, Death Games, Death Sentence and Doggie Heaven. The script has very few flaws, and justifies each of the director's visual pyrotechnics.James Wan and Leigh Whannell's screenplay is truly linked to the original, and even though there is a new introduction to some of the characters - notably Josh himself and medium Elise (Lin Shaye) - most of them are not. Some events in this sequence reverberate in scenes from the first tape, adding a very ingenious concept of spiritual time travel, linking scenes from the two films. For fans of time travel stories, Insidious: Chapter 2 turns out to be Back to the Future 2 (1989) of the horror genre. That's because the feature film revisits its previous film, showing us another meaning for scenes that were somewhat unanswered in the original. Within the logic of the film, people who manage to go into the afterlife are not stuck in chronological time, they can travel to the past, for example. Therefore, some scenes are reworked and we have greater explanations for curious facts. Furthermore, the Lamberts' emotional relationship and their personal arcs were carried over from the original, with the filmmakers assuming we've tracked these characters before. These dramatic elements intensify the scares, precisely because they create fear for the fate of those people.The film is divided into three cores: 1) Lorraine's old house (Barbara Hershey); 2) scenarios such as an abandoned hospital and Elise's residence, in investigations into the origin of the spirit of the time; and 3) the Beyond, well explored in the third act with an interesting feature of timelessness. This exchange of environments is effective and cuts the repeatability of the first feature, differentiating productions in structure. So we know, for example, who is the old lady in the veil who has been chasing Josh for years. Without spoiling the surprise, it can be said that this is an old and disturbed patient at the hospital where Lorraine worked. Only one thing bothers about the reveal scene: he meets Josh when the boy visits his mother at work - an ICU that is theoretically restricted to doctors and patients, not a place where employees' children roam freely.The audacity to change the approach of the frightening figure was one of Wan and Whannell's best choices, because to reprise the clichés of the first one would be suicide for the work. In place of the various spirits that haunt the Lambert family life in the first film, Insidious: Chapter 2 the narrative focuses on the main one of the ghosts we saw in the previous one - the bride in black. She is the one who has chased Josh since she was a child and, in this episode, we'll know her past and her reasons. The atmosphere of suspense is more palpable, although scares are relegated at various times. Wan no longer uses his addiction to harness a spooky scene to a deafening sound effect. This cheap trick, even though it is still used by the director, seems to be saved here, which is not without salutary. It's surprising how competently they both managed to carry out such modifications, while Insidious is a film about paranormality and childhood traumas, but focused on hauntings, Chapter 2 keeps the skeleton of the story and adds the serial killer factor, in an invention that was clearly not thought of. In the primordial idea, but which is balanced enough not to sound false. Fits perfectly.Wan's camera is prodigal in increasing the scope of the suspense, his every move is meticulously thought out. The close-ups and details are punctual and together with the soundtrack, they help the audience to immerse themselves in the fearsome story. Composer Joseph Bishara gets it right again: most of the scares are blamed on the soundtrack, but the tension is not falsely created. Also noteworthy is the good (and moderate) use of handheld cameras. Deepening into the killer's psyche is very well-crafted, his approach goes beyond smoky environments and clichéd classifications linked to childhood abuse - such things are even shown, but at no time is the villain portrayed as an innocent victim of abuse and not responsible for their actions. The mashup with the first chapter explains well many of the scares arising from it, but it does not treat the viewer as an imbecile, while it is not unexplained for those who did not watch the original.In the cast, Patrick Wilson has an interesting challenge here, with a double role appropriately harnessed by the actor, who alternates between a devoted family man and something quite different. The talented Rose Byrne, on the other hand, has little to do but pay homage to Wendy Torrence from ""The Shining."" Some supporting characters, such as Elise, also medium Carl (Steve Coulter) and Josh's mother, Lorraine (Barbara Hershey), even with somewhat forced performances, help the plot to move forward, but the nerd investigators of the occult, played by Angus Sampson and the series creator himself, Leigh Whannell, end up ""left over"" in the narrative as unnecessary distractions, mere misplaced and unnecessary comic reliefs.Here comes the fateful question: do I need to watch the first movie to see this one? The answer is yes and no. Here we go: it works as an independent play and you even learn facts of the plot, but the experience is only complete with both seen in order - well, it is no accident that the subtitle ""Chapter 2"" exists in both the original title and in Portuguese. In this case, the advantage of those who have seen the 2010 Insidious is to continue to be surprised with knots tied in the script and reencounter the Lambert family under a heavy and tense climate after experiencing (they and you) the original events. And if the first film's greatest honoree was Poltergeist, this time two other classics are recognizable through Wan's lens: Horror in Amityville (1979) and The Shining (1980), although hauntings that move chairs and play the piano also appear.There are few sequels that manage to maintain the qualities of the original film and at the same time expand what was created, something rare that happens here, it's as if every piece of the puzzle from the first film was assembled here; an example is one of Elise's lines in the first film, she comments that ""the distant"" is a place where time doesn't exist, this rule established in the first one comes up in this one very creatively, in addition to exploring much more the mythology featured in the previous movie. No wonder the movie was subtitled ""Chapter 2"", it gets the impression that the whole story of this second had been planned from the first one, and both movies could be one movie; knowing the duo from the Mortal Games series it is almost certain that they think about the plot of the sequels before they even make the first one, just as the Mortal Games pieces come together, the Insidious pieces come together too.Insidious: Chapter 2 causes mixed feelings after its denouement: while the impression that its existence is ultimately unnecessary, the film also justifies its usefulness by creating intelligent and slightly complex connections with the first film, adding new layers the story of the Lambert family and its ghosts, while it presents us with a very refined technical work, artful tricks with the camera, interesting internal symbolisms and a very well-constructed atmosphere. The big problem is the feeling of ""I've seen this before"" that we feel during the projection, even with the surprises presented by the script. The clichés once again work as a way to subvert certain predictability and surprise the viewer with unusual developments, and such a device still works, but without that slight amount of novelty seen in the first film.The film is bigger chapter because it explores the mythology created in the first movie in depth, all the well-crafted suspense construction with the camera play, dark frames and sinister soundtrack are present here. Thanks to a razor-sharp main cast and subversions of well-worn movie concepts involving hauntings, convincingly closing the Lambert story but leaving loose ends for an upcoming film, Insidious: Chapter 2 passes the test of sequels that outperform the original. It may not be as scary as The Conjuring (2013), James Wan's previous work, but it manages to entertain fans of the genre in just the right measure.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Chapter One was better and more than enough.,"Chapter 2 is easily watchable, however. In the plus column, thank goodness the director/writer understand that horror movie victims should be sympathetic and likable (at least in this series compared to the SAW series). They're one of the very few mainstream horror teams that understand this, and it's a shame because classic horror filmmakers usually understood that the true horror was in bad things happening to good people. However, this film doesn't really take the story in an interesting or necessary place. It was clearly only made to increase returns, and it shows. It's very much a retread of the first film in many ways, but any potential scares are lost because the experience isn't different enough from the original to warrant any fear. Plus, one HUGELY annoying aspect of these films--especially because they know better--is when the audio suddenly blasts with a startle effect (I'm not calling them jump-scares because they were simply annoying) and violin strings or whatever instrument violently assault our ears. WHY did they do this?? It's even cheaper than a standard-issue startle effect because it's like they're screaming ""BE AFRAID!"" into our ears with a bullhorn. Ridiculous.If you like the first film, you might like this one, but, honestly, if you skipped it, that would be fine too. You won't be missing anything significant at all.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Rosa Byrne and Patrick Wilson once again make this Worthwhile,","Insidious: Chapter 2 is a decent movie with a reasonably well developed storyline and a mostly impressive cast. As far as sequels go, it holds up very well in comparison to its original, they are both simple horrors that want to do nothing more than thrill, although I actually enjoyed this movie more, mainly because Rosa Byrne and Patrick Wilson get to shine a lot more, adding extra layers to these characters that I found much more effective than the first. It certainly lacks originality from its predecessor, it almost hits every single note the same way, it dosen't try hard enough to be different and really surprise viewers, and anyone who has seen the first movie will know what's coming from start to finish. I would blame the writing for the main weakness of this film, the cast and directing try their very best, but when it comes down to it, it's a poor script, it jumps around a lot, making it unclear where it is really going on several occasions, as well as unnecessarily lingering on certain plot points when the audience is anxious to keep things moving. Fun to watch with friends, but unless you're sensitive to horror, Insidious: Chapter 2 offers little thrills and lacks originality.Two parents are desperate to prevent the malevolent spirits from haunting their family once again.Best Performance: Rosa Byrne",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Do not bother seeing this film, wait for RedBox Release","Most people in the theater were laughing, I was cracking up as well.

Red Box worthy only, The Conjuring was a scary movie, Insidious 2 was for little boys and girls who think communicating with the dead using Yahtzee like word dice and talking through tin cans and a string with ghosts is scary.One thing is for certain, any movie will have it's moments, things that make you jump, but whatever moments of terror are dealt you are immediately pulled back into the reality that you can't take any of this seriously.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great ideas killed by bad ending,"The Lambert family continue their battle with malevolent spirits. The father, Josh, appears to be possessed after the events of the previous chapter. Elise, the physic and expert, is dead which leaves Specs and Tucker left to carry-on the investigation into the Lambert's past. Meanwhile, Renai and Dalton continue to be haunted by multiple entities.Taking the best elements from previously successful haunted house movies, James Wan and Leigh Whannell's Insidious began as one of the most frightening. Once things were explained the chills were lost, as the concept seemed silly, but through miraculous direction it played out to near perfection.The screenplay for Chapter 2 has some of the most original ideas to be used in a horror film sequel. There's some cheesy dialogue in the first few scenes and there's some plot variations as far as this chapter and what we remember seeing from the first. In the most clever ways, Leigh Whannell makes everything work in his favor and delivers what could have been the greatest horror movie sequel to date. This time it's the delivery of some of the scenes that are lacking. Everything seems rushed, especially what is suppose to be a climax and conclusion for the film.Insidious Chapter 2 takes the story in a lot of fun new directions but doesn't explore them far enough.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Great horror without the blood! 6/10,"Review: For someone who doesn't really enjoy the paranormal horrors, I actually liked this movie. It does take some time to get going, but once it does, it is on the edge of your seat stuff. For how much the movie cost to make, it did make a hell of an amount of money so the audiences must have loved it. It's not a gory horror so there isn't loads of blood all over the place, but it does deal with the paranormal which was pretty intense. All of the same characters from the first one, are in this movie which makes the franchise flow great, not like other movies when they get totally different characters. It's great for the scary and mystical factor and I loved the ending. Watchable!Round-Up: It's not very often that you watch a horror which doesn't really have that much blood in it. All of the usual paranormal movies have this video camera look to them, but this movie gives it more of a true to life feel. The ending left an opening for another movie in this franchise, which I would like to see. I just hope that they keep some of the original characters. Anyway, this is definitely one to watch if you are into this type of movie, and even if your not, you still have the family drama aspect.Budget: $5million Worldwide Gross: $161millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there paranormal/horror movies and who were fans of the first movie. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A decent follow up with extra flavours,"A satisfying horror sequel from the director of 'Saw'. As a second installment to 'Insidious', it went deeper into the behind story of a character of the movie. Yeah, the first one was told about a boy's special talent astral projection where he can travel to another world in his sleep. I considered that was the movie's advantage but comparing to this, they just implemented the same idea with neglecting the boy. In this movie it describes more about the father's perspective of the story without held back the much required secret for the twist at the end.It opens with a story that set in 1986 where Josh as a kid is haunted by the souls of dead. Soon the story commence on present time where the Lambert family begins to feel again the presence of evil forces in their house. A team of spiritual medium begins their part to expose and free the family from dark forces. I thought the spiritual medium characters Elise and Carl is imitating the dwarf woman and an Indian characters from 'Poltergeist' movie series. I can say director was a clever, he just put away the usual ingredients of the horror genre and added different flavours like time travel and psychology.For adults, most of the horror movies won't scary but watching during night will give more effective. So it a such movie you should try at a dark time for your own advantage to extract from it a better entertainment. I liked the first movie and this one is not far behind with the quality that all horror movie must have. So felt it is a decent follow up with a flashback story.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good, but not as good","Insidious chapter 2 picks up were Insidious ended. No spoilers here, but if you want to enjoy this one, you must watch the first Insidious or you won't be able to keep up with the story. This second chapter is a watchable movie, but it's more about the mystery than about scares, frights or horror... Insidious was suspenful, but it also delivered as an horror movie, this chapter is more science fiction with a pinch of horror. Storywise, this movie does it's job, (and personally I think that, if it is a sequel it should continue the previous movie story, and this one picks up exactlly where the first one ended, so, kudos), but it isn't as interesting as the first, and a little more predictable. As for the acting, very good, but honestly, who watches these films for the acting? If it ain't bad it isn't going to be Oscar worthy anyway...

Predictable bore.,What a God awful film with wooden acting from a wooden story. They will no doubt churn another couple of these rotters before we meet our apocalypse but I for one will not be watching them. Lots of overly loud screams that's not very scary in fact every time we see our friendly ghosts they seem to just scream at our protagonists which fills me with the desire to shout back or assault my television. I don't know why we as the human species are obsessed with crap sequels but in movie history there are a handful of films worth the effort of making more of because them films (which I'm not listing but u know the ones) had a story worth the effort. Now I understand why they do it because the sheeple will watch any old crap if it was OK first time round and sold a few tickets. In conclusion it's a long winded screaming contest with predictable story and bad acting.,2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Arguably one of the best horror sequels ever made,"Insidious Chapter 2 is arguably one of the best horror sequels ever made. It keeps the elements that made the original so successful intact, while introducing the audience to new/ different pieces to freshen it up.While watching the film I could really see how The Conjuring educated Wan in how to set up horror scenes for more effective delivery. Just like there was ""Hide and Clap"" (children's game) in The Conjuring, he introduces ""The Can Telephone"" to set up quite the satisfying scare towards the middle. I really appreciated this prop coming in at the end as well.. His movies have such a creative / playfulness in scare manifestation. His team now has an inexhaustible element to continue to play with. Maybe this will even become his signature style of scare?This was an effective sequel as well because it deepens and expands the story simultaneously. We get to see what happens seconds later after the first film, while going into Josh's past.. I so enjoyed seeing scenes from the first film reevaluated too.. This is reminiscent of great sequels such as Back to the Future Part Two and Harry Potter 3.So overall, this is a great film. Wan and his team keeps getting better and better at their craft, developing and playing with new ways to scare, while staying within their signature style. The film in the end comes to a very satisfying conclusion..As much as I loved this film, I really hope it ends here. They did such a great job avoiding sequel pitfalls, I'm not sure a third film would be as successful..They end it where hope and dread meet. Is there any better place to be?",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than it's prequel,"Insidious 2 has a more complex story than its prequel. You have to watch Insidious 1 first, because it will make you easier to understand this movie. James Wan as director, added a bit of the background story, so Insidious 2 is not only a scary movie. He also put new characters, making the red yarn so it become a continuation of Insidious 1. It's very interesting and worth for thumbs up.Some scary tricks look fresh and not repeat from previous horror films. James Wan uses some properties such as stroller and dice. The effort to create an atmosphere and setting to support the story but still look fresh also arguably successful, such as a bedroom with a rocking horse, a hospital and an elevator. James Wan did a lot of exploration and don't want to just get stuck in the house, a good effort.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"""In my line of work things tend to happen when it gets dark""","The second chapter of the Insidious franchise picks up directly after the events of its predecessor and it has more elements to offer than the first installment. We learn the backstory of the Bride in Black and her connection to the Lambert family. We also get some explanation of why Josh was chosen as the vessel of the spirit.The first half of the film is a little slow-paced but as the story progresses more questions get answered, which explains some of the missing links to the random occurrences that happened in the first chapter, and all of these tie in quite nicely to the story as a whole.My main annoyance here is I feel like some parts of the story aren't told with enough clarity. While the basic plot is simple enough to recognize. The time-traveling aspect in the further was murky to fully appreciate, and I truly think they could have used a character like Elise (Lin Shaye) to acknowledge some of the finer details and give us some type of established ground rules to make it easier for us to understand.The gradual possession worked well in this film with the full-body deterioration of Josh. His teeth start to fall out. He commences to age rapidly, and his psychological state of mind falters, as he begins to hear voices in his head. We also, notice his interactions with his family begin to become more aggressive.This is a film that has good ideas that just fall by the way they are executed on screen. I feel that reading the main plot online gives you a clearer picture of what the writer and director were trying to tell us in the film, and this makes you understand the whole story much better.I did enjoy that the whole cast from the first chapter returned as it makes a big difference when you are engrossed in a story. There is a nice blend of suspense, action, and light-hearted comedy. This isn't a horror film, but more of a thriller with a sprinkle of family drama, that highlights strong possession and haunting themes. Nonetheless, it is an amusing film and I say keep them coming, I can't wait for chapter three.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

However, it remains an enjoyable watch thanks to the sense of closure it brings and the fun ways in which it revisits moments from the original.Rose Byrne remains great as her character gets put through even more torment and Patrick Wilson gets to play two very different roles. Josh remains a likeable character but he really gets to have a ball when playing the psychotic spirit possessing him and embrace his inner Jack Torrance.James Wan's direction is surprisingly pedestrian, despite a bigger budget there's none of the energy or inventiveness that was present previously and all the reliance on found footage early on is really frustrating. The bigger budget does result in a film that's more vibrant visually than the excessive greys of the original and anything in the further remains a highlight.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"sort of entertaining, but fairly bad","The first one was a good horror. Nobody can say the opposite of that. Not a masterpiece, but a solid horror at least. Obviously we want something of about the same caliber for the sequel.Where the first one had genuine story telling, this one had just bland development with pieces and themes from a bunch of other thriller-horrors. Where the first had drive and emotion, this one had just some more flat action. Where the first one had good structure and tension, this one is slightly random/uneven and with slowdowns in rhythm. Where the first one had good scares, this one is just some more of that PG13 Hollywood mainstream horror.This is basically a lazy continuation of the first, with no real motive or at least a failed attempt at building from the original and recreating a piece that is as challenging and that keeps the same quality formula while expanding on other possible notions of the Insidious realm. It's just leaning on the first, bringing uninteresting, predictable explanations to a film that didn't need any. Parasitic, feeding off the originality of the first without bringing anything itself.There's absolutely nothing notorious or memorable about it, and most if not all scenes are a letdown. There isn't a section or concept in the 100 minutes that remotely push the boundaries of the series or offer authentic thought or artistic vision.Check it out yourself if you liked the first, but the people on here calling it a ""masterpiece"" or whatever need to stop whatever they're doing wrong in life in general...seems very dangerous, whatever it is.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

#scream#,"How a movie like this are rated as PG-13 by the MPAA I will never understand!!!Have you played with an Ouija (commonly pronounced as Wee- Gee) board? The grisly creative minds of SAW; James Wan (Director/Writer) and Leigh Whannel (Writer) pens down a rather similar school of thought when Carl (Steve Coulter) uses a bag of dice to communicate with the realm of the spirits in search of Elise (Lin Shaye). INSIDIOUS: CHAPTER 2 picks up exactly where the first movie left off. The fact that the plot continues without losing its sense of interest and delivering even greater jolts and thrills simply earns this movie a spot on the ""A list of must watch horror-movies"". As the first movie wrapped up Josh Lambert (Patrick Wilson) was left behind in the spirit world where he walked into save his son Dalton (Ty Simpkins). Something did return back to Josh's body but it was not him, instead it is something darker and more deadly than anything the Lambert family has ever experienced in decades. INSIDIOUS: CHAPTER 2 is his desperate and fervent effort to leave the dimly lit spirit world and reunite with his wife and kids.James Wan & Leigh Whannel, that's 2 for 2 for the year 2013. Whilst the secret to their success is as simple as having two of the most ingenious minds in the industry do they have what it takes to keep the dice rolling (pun well intended!). Certain answers the audience did not get to observable questions such as ""How did it all begin?"" the only possible answer that I can think of is maybe they are saving it for the 3rd movie. In an entirely singular angle the logic behind the plain and simple plot is what keeps fear in the movie flowing. Wan and Whannel do not use up on screen time for rationalization, instead every single revelation of facts is done via the interference of the spirits. This sells well into the intensity of INSIDIOUS: CHAPTER 2. Scenes such as Elise returning, the young Josh and the dice are 3 examples of how the writers revealed information without wasting time over Tiffin. As a fan of the genre something that could have been different in the production are the camera angles the horror flick has been shot with. I could not but help note more than a handful of similarities amongst INSIDIOUS: CHAPTER 2 vs. THE CONJURING. This does not work against it at anytime; it is just a personal preference.You will appreciate the detailed effort the crew makes in the revelation of reasons behind the occurrence. The flashbacks, the spirits and the reality of them are uncanny and are assured to scare your eyeballs out of its sockets if watched during the night. One of my personal favorites is the scene where Renai (Rose Byrne) is confronted by Mother for the first time. Two things about that scene is one can never predict it and Byrnes acting is so convincing that the scare will linger for a good 5 minutes as you will try hard to slow your heart rate down. This is what good horror movies should be made of and I am glad directors and actors of this caliber still exist. Let me not spoil this any further for you. Let me let you decide and maybe you can tell me what the experience was like for you.The obvious question; what is the better movie? INSIDIOUS: CHAPTER 2 or THE CONJURING. My answer is simple fighting an enemy you cannot fully see is always scarier. To figure out what movie it is, I guess you must watch them both.TITLE: INSIDIOUS: CHAPTER 2 DIRECTED BY: JAMES WAN STARRING: PATRICK Wilson, ROSE BYRNE, BARBRA HERSHEY,LIN SHAYE,TY SIMPKINS, LEIGH WHANNEL, ANGUS SAMPSON & STEVE COULTER RATED: PG 13 RATING: 07/10 RUNTIME: 106 MINUTES",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Not as good as the original but it does deliver what most fans of Wan's have come to expect.,"'INSIDIOUS: CHAPTER 2': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Horror master James Wan reteams with his usual partner in crime Leigh Whannell for this sequel to their 2011 indie spook-fest hit 'INSIDIOUS'. Wan once again directed the film and Whannell wrote the screenplay (as well as co-stars in the movie). Oren Peli (who wrote and directed another low budget scary movie blockbuster 'PARANORMAL ACTIVITY') produced the film with Jason Blum (the two also produced the first one together). Stars Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, Ty Simpkins, Lin Shaye and Barbara Hershey all reprise their roles from the first film. Wilson also starred in Wan's recent blockbuster 'THE CONJURING' as well. The film picks up right where the first one left off with the Lambert family still battling ghosts trying to take possession of their bodies. It's not as good as the original but it does deliver what most fans have come to expect from Wan and Whannell.After a flashback to 1986, when Josh (Wilson) was a child (Garrett Ryan) and he first met paranormal investigators Elise Rainier (Lin Shaye) and her friend Carl (Steve Coulter), the movie picks up right where the first one left off. Elise has been murdered and the police think Josh did it. Renai (Byrne) at first defends her husband but then slowly begins to question whether he's still the man she knows and loves. Have evil spirits gotten a hold of him? Only the secrets from his past can explain why the Lambert family is still haunted now. Whannell and Angus Sampson reprise their roles as paranormal investigators investigating the Lamberts' haunting.The movie has a lot of cool scenes and scares but as a whole I found it a lot less involving (than the first film, as well as Wan's other work). It's almost too fast paced; there's way too much going on without ever slowing down to develop the characters and their emotional investment in what's happening around them. For me this made the film a lot less scary and effective. Technically it's a perfect example of the genre though (mood and atmosphere are great) and if you look at the movies as just one continuous film this movie works a lot more efficiently as just the second and third acts of a bigger story. I love Wan and Whannell's style though (and Whannell and Sampson are once again comedic scene-stealers in the film). Breaking the movie down I liked and enjoyed each scene on it's own but in the context of the whole film I just couldn't get into it like I could the first. Not a bad horror film in any way just not quite as good as I was hoping.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llO-AVcYkfI",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Brilliant one,"""Insidious: Chapter 2"" continues the haunting tale with a 7/10 rating from me, and I found it quite likable. The acting, particularly Lin Shaye's reprisal of Elise, brings depth to the story, and the film editing maintains a solid pace, seamlessly weaving together the past and present. The film's strength lies in its commitment to expanding the narrative, delving deeper into the supernatural mysteries that have plagued the Lambert family. The music enhances the film's eerie atmosphere, and the cinematography captures the chilling moments effectively.

"A movie no one needs, except people who like bad movies","I saw it in a sneak preview yesterday. I didn't see chapter one, but I didn't miss the information from that one. What pretty much sums it up - when the Movie started, the cinema was almost completely full. After 15 minutes, it was half empty.I don't blame the actors for that disaster, it was just a horrible script and directing at it's worst.The movie offers nothing at all that would be even the least bit intriguing. There are hundreds, thousands of movies out there with the same look and feel. It is just so unnecessary to redo that stuff all over again. If you really feel like you have to do a ghost movie, than try to be a bit innovative and present something the audience hasn't seen or doesn't expect.The audience laughed most of the time, because of the predictable and stupid dialogs.I am shocked to see, that the same director gets to do Fast and Furious 7, since the last two actually got better I'm afraid that he kills the series.It's incredible, I mean he did ""Saw"". That really was something. But what came after, shows pretty much Wan is a one hit wonder. He should either take some time out and fuel up with some new ideas, or just leave the scene. Movies like Insidious 2 are a waste of time and money....",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Amazing sequel !,"When i entered the cinema i said "" This is gonna suck "" i was COMPLETELY wrong ! Ok it wasn't as scary as the first one but the storyline and it has much more mystery than the first ! The only thing that i REALLY didn't like about this film ( and that's why i didn't rate it 10/10 ) is that it gets complicated . So if you want to have fun watching this movie don't put yourself to think TO MUCH . Overall an amazing sequel of the first one !",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A fairly decent successor to Insidious,"More of the same, except not as scary. If you watched the first film, you pretty much know what will happen in the end, anyway, Predictability makes things less scary and this film is no exception, The visuals are a little too jumpscary to be very memorable, but overall, much better than most other jumpscare horror out there.You might as well watch this one if you watched the first one.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Insidious: Chapter 2 (2013) - Review and Opinion,"After the notable repercussion of the long predecessor, James Wan continues the franchise's history with ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" (2013), a solid and competent sequel within the horror genre.The plot directly follows the final events of the first film, now with greater focus on Josh, instead of Dalton. The film explores new scenarios to avoid excessive repetition of the main house, bringing a broader dynamic to the narrative. The antagonistic figure receives much more in-depth development, especially compared to the Lipstick-Face Demon, the villain of the previous film who had superficial or almost non-existent motivations. Furthermore, the plot twists add value to the work, surprising the viewer. However, as in other productions directed by Wan, there are an excess of unnecessary jumpscares, which may displease some of the audience. Although it presents few negative points, the film follows the same formula already seen in the director's other projects, without major innovations other than a better-crafted script.""Insidious: Chapter 2"" delivers an experience very similar to the first film, but with specific improvements. Without disappointing fans of the franchise, the sequel further consolidates the saga in the mainstream scene.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Thought it would be scarier,"I really thought this movie was going to be so much scarier, the commercial made it seem scary as hell and the first movie was pretty scary to me so I gave the second one a shot. This movie had it's creepiness, scares and great suspense but I guess once I found out the truth about the ghost, it didn't seem too scary to me at all. Really good plot and twists though!! So I gave it a 6 for that but took away stars because I expected so much more, even my little sister was barely scared during the movie. The sad part is that the showing of the title and music with it was scarier and creepier than the whole movie (sounds weird but yeah), we even tried to hurry up and turn off the movie at the end! All in all, this was a good movie if you didn't have high expectations like I did. I'd say to go right ahead and watch it. It has it's creepy and scary moments and the suspense was really great, these people really knew how to build up suspense scenes.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Let's welcome a new genre,"This film is very good and completely worth the watch. If you have not seen the first one then prepare to be a tad bit confused and reluctant to enjoying this film. After watching the film piece itself together in conjunction to part one I was very impressed. This type of intricacy leaves its audiences wanting more like it from similar genres. A film like Insidious has created its own genre of cult terror. But lets face it, nowadays there seem to be some slacking in the creative minds of writers. The acting was great and while I remained interested in what was going to happen next, I did catch myself yawning a few times at the let down scares following the dramatic build ups. I think if you go into this film expecting to see a great thriller, not horror then you'll be just fine. Otherwise, don't set your standards too high, for what the movie tries to accomplish it passes, terrifying the audience. For what others would expect, horror, it fails.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Complete disappointment,"I was facing a decision making with my friends of which movie we should watch, most of them had this idea about watching HORROR. and we found Insidious Chapter 2. i rushed to check IMDb before we book and read some reviews about it. and 7 in IMDb is actually promising! and most of the reviews and votes where high. But, we were honestly was shocked and disappointed about everything in this movie, the story didn't add anything new, it's the same as watching a horror movie 20 years ago, so many things didn't make any sense. and the acting was not that good, except for Rose Byrne, she did great as ACTING. but the rest were in a comedy movie by mistake.we really wanted to be scared and jump off our chairs, but that didn't work at all except for very few scenes.

James Wan Does It Again!,"James Wan picks up from the last installment and certainly does not disappoint. This film really does live up to the hype. After watching it, I was so glad that I recently watched ""Insidious Chapter I"". I do agree that you can watch the film without seeing the first part however I think if you do, you will appreciate part II even more.James Wan's intricate woven plot proves that horror films don't need to be linear with some blood and gore to be scary. James Wan's direction for ""The Conjuring"" and ""Insidious I"" was spot on. It is no different this time around. Insidious Chapter II deals with many sub layers like time travel but Wan seamlessly pulls it off. He seems to have mastered the use of lighting which creates this creepy yet thrilling atmosphere. The pacing of the film is perfect and personally I think an improvement from last time. I like the way Wan creates suspense with no music just silence. It isn't too obvious when the scares are going to happen. That sense of not knowing is the reason why I enjoyed it. Also if Wan does go for a big scare, it will be a ""BIG"" scare.Insidious II has good acting, good suspense and definitely some good scares. Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne on top form once again. Definitely go and see ""Insidious chapter II"". It certainly is one of the better horror films in recent years. You will not be disappointed!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Possession, evil spirits and heroes.","This is a good movie. The story is somewhat muddled but that is more than made up for by the acting and the characters. The idea of someone actually being someone else is not new, but in this movie it is given a new twist, with good results. The star of this movie is Barbara Hershey whose presence improves this movie a lot. Malevolent spirits in a alternate universe interacting with the living to cause mayhem can come off as hokey, but in this movie it works. The connection between the here and there is established and is made to seem believable. Children are most vulnerable to manipulation, but there are heroes too, which balances out the story. Elise is a hero, in both worlds. Patrick Wilson gives a strong performance as a man possessed for decades. What is real and not real becomes blurred as behavior becomes more erratic and violent and those around you can only wonder and become concerned - and frightened. How would you feel if one day you discovered that your spouse was possessed by an evil spirit?",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Lots of people didn't like the fact that it was funny, but I did. They mixed it up well with comedy and horror, and created a better sequel than the first.The story was amazing though, it summed up all the questions we had after the first of this series.

Scare-less but syncs in with the first!,"Horror as a genre, often ends up not keeping the promises they make. While there are classics and modern flicks that scares the bejesus outta you, there are also those which doesn't always click. And I can mention a lot more of those than the ones that's actually scary. Then there are of course horror movies that actually work for one and not the other coz, I believe, we all have varied scare-tolerances. I for myself can handle 'gore' like piece of cake but can't stand twitchy supernatural beings. Frankly, the found footage horror movies has ruined the genre to some degree. How many Paranormal Activity sequels can you watch until you get bored of scaring yourself with flying frying pans. When the said genre was imbued with those horror movie dingus, James Wan, went the old school way with 2010′s Insidious. Insidious had everything in store for horror fanatics. It was atmospheric and Wan not resorting to monster closets and cliché's were a welcome change. While the movie did have its flaws, it still stood out among the hosh-posh horror movies. I have fond memories of watching Insidious at the dead of the night with my headphones on and boy, I was freaked outta my wits, at least for the first two acts. Agreed James Wan is a man of many talents, having directed blockbusters in almost every genre as evident from movies like Saw and Insidious to Death Sentence and the upcoming Fast & Furious 7 but when it came to The Conjuring I could agree less with the majority who praised it sky high. The Conjuring was a well directed piece, adorned with brilliant performances but it was anything but scary.Insidious Chapter 2 starts off where the first left off. The Lambert family was still not completely clear of the malice from part one and without spoiling much its assured that there was plenty much more in store for them. While Insidious was all about astral projections, this ones more about the ones that passed through the portal. Initially it was all but slow, but when it got to the second act it got more interesting at the cost of dropping the atmospheric quality the first had. There was a huge tonal shift. The movie took a fine take at continuing the Insidious myth and seamlessly ties in with the first's story filling whatever gaping holes it had. If you wanna be in sync with whats happening in Chapter 2 you ought watch Chapter one. Watching Insidious is mandatory, nuff said. But scares-wise the movie lacked, almost as much as The Conjuring. And it also had some odd comedy injected. For a story arc that was so serious, the comedy felt distracting. The performances of the cast were splendid, especially of Rose Bryne as Renai Lambert, her helplessness was direly felt. Patrick Wilson's characters were also noteworthy and you'll know why I mentioned 'characters' when you watch it. Lin Shaye's Elise was a remarkable performance as well.Ending on an ambiguous note, Insidious Chapter 2 leaves a lot of scope for sequels. For one, I really missed the Red-face demon from the first, who was nowhere to be seen or heard in Chapter 2. James Wan made 2 horror movies this year, The Conjuring was a fairly entertaining movie (had it not been so hyped) and in Insidious Chapter 2, he was not reluctant to play with its myth expanding its own universe. I cant wait to see what he's going to do with the now-humdrum Fast & Furious franchise next year.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The first one's better.,"The sequel to the hit horror film by James Wan was somewhat not what I expected. Of course you would have expected less because James Wan isn't directing this one but still, the first one was bad-ass. The actors are still great. Patrick Wilson, okay. The story was also great. I like how they explore Josh's past and how they connect this film to the happenings on the first one. Exploring the ghost's past was also good. I only complain about one thing---It lacked the cheap-but-effective-way of scaring you that made the first one awesome. There is no WTF moments on this film. Still, it's a watchable film and good for those people who are still hungry for more after watching the first film. Plus, there's a hint for a next chapter before the credits roll.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

6 ?,"First of all, I did not know there was chapter two to the Insidious!

For me - at least - the part when story gets 'into the head of Josh' or becomes supernatural, that is when I lose interest in film and thought it was not believable anymore.I know it is a movie and it is a horror and those things do not exist, but just making them look less possible was a turn off for the movie.Especially the ghost hunter lady seemed totally out of place and too 'real' for someone dead. Darkness and mist did not work for me to make 'a scary in the head images' All in all, give it 6!

Insult 2,"What can I say. I am not a huge fan of horror flicks but I do admire James Wan. Well, Insidious 2 is not horror at all after all. I saw it yesterday and I must say I was embarrassed in front of my husband as I was insisting to see it. The plot very basic, like a repeat of Chapter 1. Josh not compelling at all and Rose Byrns had a wooden constant scared/dull expression on her face throughout the entire film. The shifts back and forth in time were totally confusing and clumsily done. The effects were utterly cheap (I hated that steam-effect....how cheesy like an 80s disco)and the Gothic, powdered face smokey eyed ghosts were a joke. Also this movie was stupid. If the ghost was attacking the baby WHY WAS THAT IDIOT MOTHER LEAVING IT ALONE ALL THE TIME???? Oh, and those two geeks (the snowboarder throwback and the nerd)what were they all about?

Decent enough supernatural sequel,"This review assumes people have already seen the original film; if you haven't seen it yet I'd definitely recommend watching it before watching this or it won't make much sense.This film follows on shortly after the events of the first film. Josh and Renai Lambert have moved into Josh's mother's home, along with their children, and the police suspect Josh may be involved in the killing of psychic Elise Rainier. They had hoped that the strange events would have stopped but it soon becomes clear that whatever was haunting them has followed the family. Renai contacts Elise's associates, Tucker and Specs, and they start to investigate with the help of Carl, an old colleague of Elise. This leads to a series of creepy locations and the eventual identification of the being haunting the Lambert family.Horror is a fairly personal genre; a film that will terrify one person may leave another wondering what all the fuss was about. I didn't find it all that scary but it did have its moments. It is refreshing to have modern horror that isn't particularly gory, has no particularly offensive language and no gratuitous sex/nudity... instead it achieves its goals through decent jump scares and a nice creepy atmosphere. The soundtrack impressively adds to this atmosphere. I didn't find it as good as the first film but found it enjoyable enough. The story has some interesting ideas and others that seemed to be inspired by better films... most obviously 'Psycho'. The cast does a solid enough job with the material. Overall a decent enough film if you enjoyed the first.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great visuals; a good haunted house film,"Personally, I don't feel they needed to make this film. The law of sequels is that they have to explain, so the parts of the first film that existed in your imagination are going to be put to rest. That's the only real negative.The acting was solid. They did a good job of taking disparate horror elements to create something new. And they paid homage to film like The Shinning. They also set up the sequel.If you like haunted house films, you'll enjoy the first half. If you want to know the specifics of what happened in the first film you'll like the second half.

A hit and miss sequel,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Insidious: Chapter 2"" (2013) is of course a sequel to ""Insidious"" (2010. In my opinion, first movie was better.

And while i liked revelations and etc. I think that best horror movies works better when story is simple, involving and easy to follow and that is when creators can do their magic with horror aspect. ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" has a story which i could have least expected after first movie, but knowing that they came up with it only after first movie was huge success given its micro budget - it is kinda forgivable.Overall, ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" is a hit and miss horror movie.

MUST Watch Part 1 First To Better Appreciate This Sequel,"This is one of those sequels that really require you to watch the first one in order to enjoy it adequately. I watched the first ""Insidious"" when it was released three years ago, and honestly I do not recall much about it. In fact, I did not really like the film that much back then.I read a lot of bad reviews about ""Insidious 2"". I did not feel compelled to watch it. However I noted that three weeks after its local release, there are still a lot of theaters showing ""Insidious 2"". I felt I must have misjudged it since there are still a lot of people watching it up to now.So I decided to watch the first ""Insidious"" again before watching ""Insidious 2"". I must say, on second watching I thought the first ""Insidious"" was actually the excellent horror movie that it was touted to be back then. I must have watched it when I was not in the mood or something, hence my lukewarm reaction at first. I liked it a lot better this time on re-watching.Then, I went on to watch ""Insidious 2"" right away. Lo and behold, I now think this second chapter is actually a very good sequel after all. And this franchise is actually worth all the hype it has.""Insidious 2"" actually starts with a flashback to when young Lorraine was consulting young Elise about young Josh's bad dreams. We already know this fact from Part 1. Then after the creepy opening credits, the story picks up from how the story ended in 1, the aftermath of Elise's murder and the possession of Josh by the Bride in Black. Now that Elise is dead, how can the Lambert family get rid of this pesky and increasingly malevolent spirit from tormenting their family?The story will go as you may probably predict already, but there are several twists and turns that will still keep you at the edge of your seats and make you jump. I particularly like the fact that spirits in The Further could do time travel and affect events from the past. Of course, like all time travel devices, there will be plot questions that may arise. However, in this case, I thought this gave it a unique aspect that was very interesting. Ghost hunters Specs and Tucker are still here in Part 2 to provide welcome comic relief, and that was good.Overall, ""Insidious 2,"" though now lacking the freshness of ideas from the first ""Insidious,"" still manages to give us the jumps and scares we crave for in watching films like this. It will also give us a lot of haunting and disturbing images and moments. Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, Barbara Hershey, Lin Shaye and Ty Simpkins all reprise their roles creditably, with additional richer dimensions.James Wan, just fresh from his success with ""The Conjuring"" earlier this year, comes up with another winner horror film. Now I understand why ""Insidious 2"" has a longer-than-expected shelf life in theaters. I am recommending this for horror film fans, but definitely re-familiarize yourself with the first ""Insidious"" film first.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Cheesy,"This movie is very cheesy and boring. Horrible acting! Boring me to death. Some sort of supposed horror not scary at all kind of funny. Well, I guess most horrors are a lot like this but this is the most pathetic one I've ever watched. Something to do with a mysterious satanic demon. The classic eerie music that is meant to add drama collides with the false attitude of the film making a laughable scene. Everything feels over dramatized and stretched out yet it jumps around in an irrelevant matter. I hope no one will ever view this outrageous nonsense ever again. Police believe the male character murdered this lady who was some sort of exorcist. They blame it on some demon or ghost. The man yells at the female character enraged by her partial decision to blame him for such things also.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Above Average: 6.5,"I believe that part of what made the first Insidious such a talking point was that noone saw it coming. Like Paranormal Activity before it, it came out with a minimalist advertising campaign that only showed enough to get people interested. However, standards have changed since then, and on the heels of the director's The Conjuring comes Insidious: Chapter 2, charged with the unenviable task of shouldering the weight of its predecessors. The main fault of the first Insidious film was that it got more unbelievable and less scary as it went on, culminating in a kinda ridiculous final act taking place in purgatory as imagined by overexcited horror buffs. Chapter 2 is at least more consistent in its quality and believability, with no jarring shifts like the one described above. However, what is has in consistency and story, it lacks in scares. While there are certainly some chilling moments, they are nowhere near as frequent as they were inthe first film. This is somewhat disappointing, because James Wan is certainly capable of packing a higher number of scares into the same length of time. And with more subtlety.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Insidious: Chapter 2 - When Casper Gets on Steroids,"We left the Lambert family drenched in sweat, traumatized, and one scream away from a full-blown breakdown-but don't get too comfy, because James Wan isn't done wrecking their lives yet. The man doesn't believe in happy endings, he's here to shred your nerves and make you regret watching this in the dark.No time to breathe-the sequel picks up right where the first one left off. And boom, straight into a seance more intense than a job interview with the Gestapo. The vibe? A mix between a cracked-out episode of Scooby-Doo and The Shining, but directed by a guy who probably sleeps with an axe under his pillow.The biggest shift this time? Josh (Patrick Wilson) is now fully possessed-imagine an angry dad on four cans of Monster, except he's haunted by a demon instead of caffeine withdrawal. If you thought he was off in the first movie, now he's full Silent Hill final boss mode. The guy looks like he just found out his Netflix password was changed, and he's got that dead-eyed ""I will slap you into next week"" dad energy.Sure, the ""good guy turns evil"" trope isn't new, but Wan wraps it up like a booby-trapped Christmas present-you open it, and BOOM, ghostly hands choking you out. Add in Wan's signature tension-building, and soon enough, you'll be side-eyeing your own living room, wondering if your houseplant might be a poltergeist in disguise.And let's be real: if there's one director who knows how to make you jump like an old man hearing a protest outside, it's James Wan. He doesn't go for gore-for-the-sake-of-gore nonsense like Saw 58. No-his weapon is your primitive survival instincts. Shadows that move? Check. Strange noises? Check. Creepy long shots where you KNOW something's about to pop out but you still nearly piss yourself when it happens? Check, check, and check.This time, Wan spices things up with haunted baby walkers (yep, because stepping on Legos wasn't horrifying enough), dice that let you chat with the dead, and the backstory of the Bride in Black, which suddenly makes Insidious feel like a distant cousin of Psycho-except this family wants your soul on a platter.You can tell Wan is mentally halfway out the door, already thinking about the Fast & Furious franchise. The cinematography is slicker, punchier, like he's expecting Dom Toretto to crash into the spirit realm yelling ""FAMILY!"".Also, the budget? Still horror-movie-pennies compared to Hollywood blockbusters, but somehow, Wan crafts a world richer than films costing $200 million. Respect.The first hour is flawless-pure tension, mystery, and dread. Your jaw is so clenched, you stop chewing your chips. But like many horror sequels, it eventually loses its grip-devolving into a supernatural brawl that feels like an exorcism performed by an intern on sedatives.Still, Insidious 2 is a damn good sequel-scary, effective, and soaked in an atmosphere that'll haunt your dreams. Wan proves yet again that he can make you shiver with just a clever script, some eerie lighting, and a few unexpected jumpscares.Final tip: If your baby monitor starts crackling after watching this, do yourself a favor- burn it, move out, and never look back.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Interesting, but fails in all other regards.","The strongest aspect of Insidious Chapter 2 is the storyline, as it unravels to show the ghosts, the plots, etc. Unfortunately, an interesting narrative isn't enough when your horror movie falls painfully short in the actual horror department. There were only two or three scenes that were actually creepy. The acting was also quite strange. The way the scares are presented all look odd. Perhaps some scares would have worked better if executed by a different director using different angles and lighting. My point is, every shot was over saturated in color and filmed at unscary angles. It also lacks proper atmosphere, and thus proper tension. Worst of all, as soon as I saw the main ghost, the movie fell apart for me, as she didn't look particularly scary (the black bride is a bit better). There are also a lot of unintentionally funny moments, mostly due to the odd acting and weird dialogue.In the end, Insidious Chapter 2 isn't among the worst horror films. Unfortunately, its mysteries and twists aren't enough to carry the film.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great Horror Movie!!,"This movie was a huge surprise for me. I didn't believe that they could have made a successful sequel out of Insidious, but this movie was surprisingly very good.

There were some parts in this movie that made me jump more than I ever have in a horror movie. James Wan is an absolute master in the horror genre now. After seeing the Conjuring and this movie, he is proving himself to be the new name for a horror movie director.

"Superb exquisite acting! The rest - great, but not as great as the first film...","I must say that at the time I've heard about this somewhat illogical sequel to the Horror masterpiece that was Insidious - I was very skeptical. The first question that popped into my head was ""why?"". Why would you take the most creative, most original and innovative and absolutely best Supernatural Horror story of this decade and ruin it by adding unnecessary details and an inferior plot? True, Insidious ended with a lot of loose ends and had a very open ending, but what was so wrong with that? Many Horror films end this way, with the audience not receiving complete closure and therefore being forced to assume the worst. It's part of the Horror effect and experience, we've grown to love it!Having said all that, being a devout Horror fan and perhaps the biggest Insidious fan in my country - I couldn't ignore this sequel, and so I watched it, once to get acquainted, then a second time some months later for this review. The story and plot, as I've expected from the work of the geniuses who created the first chapter, were quite good, which is a big drop compared to the excellent and profound ones of the first chapter. The time overlaps games and how the events of this film helped to explain those of the first one were an excellent addition, definitely one of the features that made this film great! However, the attempt to ""widen"" the story and encompass more characters and events (as many sequels from many different genres try to do) simply felt forced and unnecessary.The music is the same eerie, creepy and scary track from the first film (or some variation of it), the cinematography occasionally switching to a home camera view is just the way it should have been, and the unnatural beings of the ""Further"" are still absolutely horrifying. Credit for these is all due to the first chapter.Which brings me to the greatest most impressive feature of this sequel, one in which it has outdone the first chapter: the acting. Acting of these profound levels, which we meet from the very start of the film, is a rare delight in modern Horror. Lindsay Seim played the supporting role of young Elise perfectly! Her body language, her facial expressions, her voice and intonations... It was like she studied Lin Shaye for years! And now, the creme de la creme: Patrick Wilson. At certain times, due to the script and plot, Wilson had to play someone else, and not his character Josh Lambert. He changed his acting, his body language and facial expressions, his voice and intonation, his personality and his character. Not since the film ""Face Off"" have I seen an actor so professionally and profoundly changing his ""game"" and creating a new character from scratch. Wilson has proven yet again that he is one of the best and most underrated actors nowadays. Watching him work is a privilege.All in all, comparing Insidious: Chapter 2 to the original Insidious, shows an inferior film, lacking in comparison in all fields except for the acting. However, objectively speaking - Horror mastermind James Wan (the Wan and only) has done it yet again! I'm not sure I can recommend this film in clear conscience, as the first film on its own is a masterpiece that needs no further additions. Still, if you're a true fan of the original, or of the excellent Director Wan and Leading Actor Wilson - you have got to watch this.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good scary franchise,"""Insidious: Chapter 2"" (2013) is the second movie in the insidious franchise and is a very decent movie that follows the incredible first one. The movie starts real fast with a bit of a prequel to inform us about what happened in the first one.Music is different than in the first one, instead of loud piano riffs it is more subtle but still eerie and creepy. The dialogue is kind of bad, because it seems so obvious to the viewer what is going on but the characters are so oblivious.Got goosebumps a lot during the communicating with the dead part but also during a lot of other really creepy scenes.Fight scenes were really bad and that is probably because the movie focusses on the horror part.This movie shows that the further was always connected to more which is really interesting but at the same time complicated. I'm excited to see what happens next.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Hillariously Underwhelming flop of a horror movie,"I have read several stellar reviews of this film, which I rented last night, and have only one question; just what in the HELL were you people watching? The movie had great potential for scares (I watched it at the in-laws home in the dark hills of Carson City,NV with the lights off), and the movie actually had a chance at some story continuity established in the semi-frightening first chapter. That, I'm afraid is where the potential ended, and the hysterical laughter began for me. The antagonist,with her sudden screeching verbal/physical assault on the family was absolutely ridiculous and un-scary. Mrs. Lambert's reaction to viewing the last scene from the first film is completely dry,lame and unbelievable. I am a fan of the horror genre, and will make excuses within my own mind to excuse some substandard acting or events, if the overall effort is in any way ambitious. Here we have yet another(shameless) money grab for the mindless masses that have facilitated the lazy and uninspired garbage that passes for horror films today. Complete waste of time unless you are in the mood for an absurd,laughable 'horror' film that will put you to sleep when you aren't rolling on the floor laughing at the family being slapped around by the cheap-looking ghost.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
What a awesome horror sequel to a great film!!,"Insidious:Chapter 2 is the horror sequel to the almighty horror Insidious. The film picks up after Insidious and The Lamberts are still being haunted by evil spirits from The Further and with Elise gone,they must like defend for themselves. This film,I used to think was a boring,crappy sequel but after watching it again,I've realised that its so good and so cool! James Wan was amazing directing this,it obviously was not as good as Insidious but only by like,a wincy,tincy,shincey bit. The film has a great script and delivers like A LOT of scares.

"""Insidious Chapter 2"" is as good as the original.","It is said that the Plains Indians used every part of the buffalo that they hunted. In much the same way, ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" (PG-13, 1:45) uses everything at its disposal - and does so VERY effectively.The follow-up to the equally good 2010 ""Insidious"" takes the Lambert family's story forward from about where the original left off. Unfortunately, there's very little I can tell you about the plot without spoiling the fun. Suffice it to say that it's not all that easy to enter the spirit world and return without being changed by the experience. I can't even tell you everyone who's in this movie without spoiling something. What I can tell you is that Patrick Wilson is back as the dad, Rose Byrne as his wife and Barbara Hershey as his mother. Oh, and James Wan is back as director and Leigh Whannell as writer.As we watch the film unfold and start to worry more and more about the effect that dad's journey in the last movie had on him.... not much happens, but Wan keeps us engaged with low-tech, old-school scares designed to make you jump in your seat. When things do start happening, the plot seems to be heading in several different directions at the same time, but then something amazing happens. The film weaves together every character, every plot point and even the most minor details so tightly that it would put an Egyptian sheet manufacturer to shame... but would make the Native American buffalo hunters very proud. (Please excuse my mixed metaphors. I couldn't decide which one to use, so I used them both.) ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" does contain some shaky acting, but the film is one of the best constructed and most entertaining horror movies I've seen in a long time. ""A-""",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Brilliantly directed , extremely satisfying sequel to the first fantastic movie.","I was not ready for this sequel. I thought this is going to be bad or lacking in scares and suspense, after the release of ""The Conjuring"". Well, i was entirely wrong. Right from the very start, my eyes were frozen to the screen. I can't take my eyes off of it.The story continues directly from the first one, with a little flashback about Josh Lambert. There's something wrong after the events occurred in the first movie proceeded. It's not finished yet with the family. I really cannot spoil the plot because you will have to see it for yourself, and experience it.There's so much element that's better than the first. Technically, it is very crafty. You won't suspect it coming. When some of the situation went over-the-top, there's more comic relief to cool down the tension. But, over-the-top never mean it's laughable. The tension it got was very unnerving and got under my skin. I don't get easily scared at horror movies. Yet, I screamed involuntarily.This is what a horror movie should be like. James Wan has a talent for directing. It never feels derivative or predictable. You just have to hang on with the ride. Horror geeks will love this movie. It's what a sequel should be, and it is a total blast.Insidious 3 (2015)",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hilariously bad!,"It surprised me that Wan actually directed this sequel, because that's not an usual thing for the guy. For that, I expected this to be at least at the level of the original, that it was bad, but watchable.
My expecteitions were wrong.
The story is so nonsensical, that is actually funny.
But you know, the best aspect of this is not the cinematography like in the first one, it's actually Patrick Wilson. He's so over the top as this poor man's version of Jack Nicholson in The Shining that is a blast watching it, it's comedy gold.

The horror of horrible,"Insidious 2 is everything its prequel was, but less in every way. The story suffered more, and the cheap shock drops were more abundant. It plays off a good idea but is poorly executed. Insidious 2 is another drop in the sea of forgettable horror films. James Wan definitely has his own style, and whilst it worked for Saw, it could not help this dying film with life. Patrick Wilson is predictable in his character, whilst Rose Byrne's character is in a constant state of terror, shock, and unstable irrationality. It should go without saying that the acting by both is below average at best. The true horror of this film is that there are sequels made, and more to come.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great sequel, even if it doesn't completely live up to the first one.","While the first ""Insidious"" took a much more chilling and slow way to get the scares, the sequel is a tad bit different in that sense. Don't get me wrong, ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" is great horror movie fare. I just feel it could've been scarier.The sequel keeps the promise of it's title (something many movies in our time fail to even do). The movie starts off right at the end of the first one and it continues the story of the Lambert family. Things seem to be calm now, life is finally back to normal for them. However, things get weird when the noises start up again along with some violent outbursts from some unfriendly guests. Yet this isn't even the worst of their problems. One certain family member seems to be losing his mind as he mutters to himself while acting completely out of character. Is something wrong with dad?One of the few things I had mixed feelings about in the first movie was the place called ""The Further."" It was definitely something of a new element compared to other recent haunted house movies, however, I just felt they didn't expand on the idea as much as they could've in the original. Happily though, they fix that in this movie. ""The Further"" is made as a much bigger part in this movie and the potential it has was finally used. You get to see some very interesting things (makeshift breadcrumbs for being lost, finding a world among the dead never seen before, and even answering questions you never realized you had). All in all, I was very happy with the much better use of ""The Further.""Also the acting was fantastic. The actors were definitely pushed to take their characters to new places. The father becoming insane (almost ""Shining"" like), the wife becoming a fighter, and the son (comatose for most of the first movie) becoming the kind of ""man of the house"" while his father is losing it. So having great acting was definitely a nice plus. After all, how many horror movies can say they had actors who could hold your attention without any sex scenes?Sadly, there are some negatives. Maybe I'm just biased in favor of the original in this circumstance but I feel this movie was not as chilling as the first one. The first movie was very chilling so the standards were already high but I can't help but feel disappointed. However, there were some nice scare scenes that you would not see coming as well as an intense climax that will take your breath away.Over all, this is a very fine addition to the inevitable franchise that is to come. Usually sequels to horror movies are terrible but this one actually did very well. It might not have been as scary as the first but it made up for that with great acting, nicely written script, nice atmosphere and intense climax. Enjoy this movie while it lasts (after all, it won't be long before we have ""Insidious: Book 4 Chapter 6"" along with ""Paranormal Activity 20"").",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Awful!,"Disjointed and possibly the most un-scary film i have ever sat through, but most annoyingly it was so boring! I love slow burners but that's often because there is something true to life about the pace and feel, but this rubbish cop out, money making, profit margin piece of tripe was so full of stupid ripped off sound effects and jumps that i was bored stiff in 20 minutes! It just keeps getting worse and more boring. The story was ridiculous and i don't care how silly people want to be trying to justify this lame pseudo intelligent film with its ludicrous attempts to try and make us think it was just plain BAD! In every way it fails as a horror. Friday the 13th part 100 are awful films but at least they do not pretend to be anything else. This is a director who has limited imagination and scope and indeed credit anymore, and is clearly running the same old machine and getting paid handsomely for it...and fair play to him! But one day people will look back and not remember him at all if this crap keeps being churned out.This film fails as a horror film because it was not scary. It fails to grab you because it was so disjointed and fragmented it was impossible to care, or at least for me. It fails due to the lack of direction and IMO because it was so clearly just about making money.Am i the only one that was bored? I mean all those screeches and jumpy sounds are find if there is any point to them but seriously i thought at times they would add them when someone sat on a chair, made a cup of tea or ironed their shirt!!! It was crazy annoying and pointless!If a couple of the actors were worse i would have given this 2 and that i think is probably too much.

The plot is predictable with characters making obvious statements of where the plot is going. It was not needed and would of been more suspenseful without. I thought some of the characters where poorly developed, and their attempts of funny one liners distracted and interrupted the theme.The climax gave us a glimpse into of the potential of this film with a dramatic fight scene, too little too late unfortunately.

Another 2 hours of my life lost forever,"So, we have the creators of the Saw franchise here and not surprisingly we are given another jumbled, unfrightening, ineffective piece of schlock.I can and have, at times enjoyed the 'reveal the answers' type of movies, but it just never works in horrors. The reason being, this isn't meant to be a playful Agatha Christie novel. It's meant to be scary, suspenseful and edge of your seat sort of stuff. No one who is a fan of horrors wants to be teased and confused, rather we want to have our pants scared off and have our pulse sent racing on a regular basis. That's what a horror is meant to do. Insidious 2 does nothing of the sort.The very cheap jump scares hold no meaning or thrill, the direction is amateurish at best, the script is mundane. The attempts at humour are laughable and very cringey. We have to wait ages before there's even a hint of something remotely frightening and when it does come we have already long since lost interest. This is childish stuff really. I would have no concerns about a 13 year old watching this and they would probably find it more humorous than anything.So when your kids ask if they can watch a horror movie, put this one on for them. Only, don't expect them to be overly pleased with your choice.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Refreshingly Good Horror Sequel,"We all know the score, a brand new original horror idea is a big hit and they capitalize on this with a shoddy poorly-written badly-acted remake with a only marginal relation to the first film... Or so we thought! Insidious: Chapter 2 completely breaks this trend, making it without doubt one of the best horror sequels in recent memory - especially for one which was unplanned! So lets focus on the good: for many the only real problem with the first was the predictable ending that left us wanting more. Whereas, although leaving us with the possibility of a third instalment, was somewhat more conclusive. Secondly, which is very unique for a horror sequel, is that it is acted by all of the original cast, which is a huge bonus for many! Added to that, the colour imagery (red lighting on the baby's crib, blackened setting for the world of the dead) and old-school horror soundtrack all added to the overall feel. Furthermore, what Insidious does well is integrate moments of suspense and full on horror into what is a detailed and well-thought-out creepy story, instead of just having someone shout out ""boo!"" every 5 minutes to make up for a lack of story. Now the few small gripes that I had: First off the child-acting can be pretty poor at times, but hey that's usually the case in most films. Secondly, a well-known theme of the Insidious franchise is that when a dead soul enters a living body, the body becomes weak and begins to die. However, without spoiling anything, there are a few scenes where one of these dying bodies manages to fight off several fully-grown men and take various blows to the head with weaponry, without so much as falling down. But hey, again it's just a small detail and certainly not the first film to exaggerate the capabilities of the human body. So yeah, overall a very good horror film in its own right, but it acts even better as a sequel to an already well-established horror film. Definitely worth a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Rather Disappointing.,"I was quick pumped to see this film being a big fan of the first, but ended up let down. Unlike the first, the scares are to few and sometimes predictable, and just aren't as fighting as the first's. The story also seemed a little similar and not really that new, which made it all the more unoriginal. I was rather annoyed how long it took for things to get into full swing and makes you look at your watch wondering ""When the hell are thing going to get crazy?"". By the end of the film I wasn't really that surprised how it concluded and that they set us up for a 3rd. In conclusion I think that since the first was so scary, one would expect is 2nd to be as/more scary, and sadly it was less which may be a let down for some fans of the first.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"If you were a fan of the first, you will love the second installment","The movie picks up right where the first left off, and really gives you the back story of the family and why they are going through everything they are going through.

There are plenty of scares, plot twists, surprises, a-ha moments, and plenty of tense moments and horror. I really enjoyed it just as much as the first. I got to see The Ultimate Insidious Experience which was a back to back double feature which was really cool to refresh what had happened in the first. There are moments that explain cleverly scenes that didn't make sense in the beginning but are cleverly resolved in the end. I have always loved the first Insidious and the second is equally as good in my book. If you didn't like the first, you won't like the second. It's just a great spooky, scary, haunted house, ghost, abandoned hospital story that is well-done and leaves you very satisfied at the end.

More nonsense,"I was no fan of the first INSIDIOUS, so there wasn't much chance of me enjoying this inferior sequel. INSIDIOUS: CHAPTER 2 follows straight on from the events of the first film, with the Lambert family once more finding themselves menaced by the spirits from beyond. POLTERGEIST it ain't.Instead, this is a convoluted and complicated film, but watching it closely isn't really rewarding, it just allows you to follow the storyline somewhat. This time around, there's a back story that takes place in the 1980s and a side story involving some supporting characters, so it's all fairly complex, but unfortunately it's a case of the 'same old' when it comes to the horror.You know: wardrobe doors opening on their own, figures seen in the background of bedrooms, characters who seem unable to successfully light their own homes. This seems to be part of a new trend in the genre, but I'm finding it frankly tiresome and, unbelievably, it's made me miss the classic stalk-and-slash scares of old.It doesn't help that the cast is also entirely lacking, particularly Rose Byrne, who has undergone drastic weight loss and seems to have lost her talent alongside. Patrick Wilson gives a cheesy turn and Barbara Hershey, well let's just say THE ENTITY was a long time ago. It doesn't help that the increasingly silly plot elements, such as possession by a serial killer, fail to gel with the storyline overall leaving this a convoluted mess.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

It also ventures into The Further, so those who thought The Further ruined the first Insidious, won't like the sequel. But it shows anything can happen in the Further. Though this one isn't as scary as the first one, the plot was a lot better with many plot twist that made this film to never get boring. But there still are the old jump scares from the first one.

Just as same with his word-of-mouth movie hit this year ""The Conjuring"", it is a legit horror flick with a little intriguing and confusing twist. I like Insidious: Chapter 2 though because I've seen how the movie had developed its characters and the fact that he was able to cleverly interlinked the movie (but in a messy way).

Sequel On Par with B-Movie Scare Tactics,"Let me say that I really was excited for this movie. The first chapter was a breath of fresh air for the horror genre. Insidious 1 gave us a sense that we were witnessing a fresh idea that offered new, creative ideas for horror fans. Where did that creativity go for the sequel?I will say that this movie, if delivered properly, could have been the better film. What we were left with though was a movie that found a way to top its cheesiness every 10 minutes or so. It had comedic humor in places that was slipped into the script but clearly didn't belong. Aside from Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne, some of the acting just simply wasn't good, feeling forced in some places. Don't even get me started on the script that left you feeling lost for about 3/4 of the film.All in all I was let down by this film.

disappointing,"James Wan is hot right now. After establishing himself in The Saw Series and than bludgeoning that franchise into the ground he made a huge return with Insidious establishing that he was great at setting a suspenseful mood enhanced with nightmarish imagery. He solidified those talents with this year's genre masterpiece The Conjuring, the scariest movie I've ever seen and an absolute instant classic. With hopes raised so high it's hard for Insidious Chapter 2 to not be a disappointment. I just never thought it would be this big of a disappointment. Following the events of the original movie we once again find ourselves with the Lambert clan as the mystery is enhanced and unraveled concerning the demonic presence that wanted to get into Josh's body. I really loved the first film. The first half is absolutely terrifying in an expected sort of way but when the plot veers into astral projection it lost a lot of people but not me it was so bizarre and twisted I found myself even more freaked out. People who had a huge problem with the film's second half will have an even harder time with this film because it mostly takes place in that bizarre universe. There are some clever goods here not to spoil anything for those intent on suffering through it. But despite the cleverness it's feels overly gimmicky, a lot of it just doesn't make any sense and the attempts at juvenile humor are only partially funny because of their forced absurdity and not that they are breaking any of the film's tension like in the first film. As for that heavy dread induced atmosphere he has become such a master at. it's not existent here we are instead punished with bouts of forced melodrama, insane campiness and one cheap scare after the next (I mean really this baby walker needs to go). Sadly there are some good ideas here. The only summation I could come up with especially with the vastly superior Conjuring and this film coming out so close together is that he spent all of his time executing that first movie and when approached about a sequel to Insidious he said awesome I have a great idea for that flick and than just kinda lost interest. Too sad because what could have been a unique spin on the haunted movie sub genre has instead become a by the numbers unintentional laugh fest. Not to say it's the worst film I've seen this year or the worst horror sequel (the grudge 2) but it's definitely a franchise killer. **.5/5",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not as good as the first, but better than most","Insidious Chapter 2 is no Insidious. After watching the first, (by myself, late at night) I had to watch ""The House Bunny"" before I could go to bed. While Chapter 2 has the requisite jump scares and ghouls in creepy make-up, the eerie foreboding, unsettling visuals and tense atmosphere that pervaded the first film just aren't as effective. Part of the reason is the sense of ""been there done that"" that was perhaps inevitable. Many of the gags from the first film are repeated here and there are really only so many ways for Rose Byrne to walk around a giant empty house looking scared. While still effective to an extent, the ""punch"" is gone (there is, however a nifty retconning of an event from the first film that I enjoyed). Unfortunately,the back half of the film abandons whatever spooky atmosphere it has managed to create, and devolves into a paranormal riff on The Shining (not unlike another Rose Byrne vehicle, ""Sunshine"", a favorite of mine that is almost ruined by the last 20 minutes, when it turns into a slasher film). Having said all that, Insidious Chapter 2 is still better than 95% of sequels out there and certainly almost any sequel in the horror genre. It mostly just suffers in comparison to the first film (I went to a double feature back-to-back screening which exacerbates the problem). It's a little goofier and the writing/plotting isn't as sharp, but it still manages to drum up some effective scares. If you liked the first one, you'll most likely find something to enjoy in Chapter 2.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Very Well Made Sequel,"I know I probably should have reviewed the first Insidious first, but I saw this one more recently and was compelled to review this one first. This movie was a great sequel to the first Insidious horror, and was a good use of my time. The 106 minutes flew by while I was watching. The events in the first film that weren't really explained that much were all explained in depth in the second installation. The 2nd chapter was also very scary, and full of jump scenes, and they were well made, don't get me wrong, but they were less surprising and less plentiful than the first. However, this movie was an above averagely scary PG-13, meaning most movies that are this scary are almost always rated R, which is another reason you could go see it. Also, this is a movie that you could go see with the kids, if they don't get scared that easily, because there is no nudity, which I like, and there are also no usages of F***, which I also like. However, if you go see it with kids under 12 or around there, they will probably have nightmares for the rest of the week. I was scared throughout the whole movie, because I knew something was coming but I never knew what. I saw it with my Dad, and he doesn't get scared that easily, and he was scared a lot of times too, so you know by that that the movie's scary. Aside from the scariness, the acting was as good, if not better than the first. It has the ""Carrie"" relationship, I call it. This means that if Josh Lambert was Carrie, and the new remake of Carrie is coming out this year or next, and Chloe Grace-Moretz is playing the new Carrie, previously played by Sissy Spacek, and since Patrick Wilson plays Josh, If they make a remake of Insidious, Chloe Grace-Moretz might not pull off the role of Carrie, but I don't know because as of right now the movie hasn't come out yet but I want to see it, the person who plays Josh will probably not pull off the role. Long sentence to make a short point, but I couldn't shorten it. He did a memorable and irreplaceable job as Josh Lambert. Also, the movie was very similar to the first, production wise and film wise. There were the same actors, the same producer, the same writer, the same composer, and some of the same entities, which made it even more realistic. The extra characters that were added in just made the film better. But never mind that, I'll talk about James Wan's interesting directing style. Instead of the fulfilling sense of dread, he uses the instant scene change style, which you don't see that much nowadays. In today's horrors, thew directors like to do a slo mo intro to the ghost most of the time, but James Wan holds nothing back. If he wants you to be scared, you'll be scared, for almost sure. This was how it was in the original film, which was also scary. By the way, the writers of the movie know where to put in specks of comedy. I give this movie and the first movie an 8 because it was very scary and realistic. GO SEE IT!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good lord lol,"This managed to be even worse than the first one. More predictable, cliche, silliness. Things that are supposed to be scary I think, that are just laughable. Seems like these movies are made for fans of that show Ghost Adventures or something.Very unrealistic, over the top acting, musical score that smashes you over the head every couple of minutes.Why do I remember these movies being good?? I guess it shows that it's nice to revisit things many years after the fact to see if your opinion still holds up.

It's confusing,"Insidious: Chapter 2
James Wan returns to direct Insidious: Chapter 2, with a story by James Wan and Leigh Whannell. It stars Jenna Ortega, Lindsay Seim, Rose Byrne, Patrick Wilson, Danielle Bisutti, Ty Simpkins, and Lin Shaye.Now that Dalton Lambert (Ty Simpkins) is awake, the Lambert family thinks they will return to normal everyday life. What they discover is Josh Lambert (Patrick Wilson) isn't himself. Meanwhile, Lorraine Lambert (Jocelin Donahue) investigates the past of these spirits from the further.I somewhat liked the first Insidious movie and was hoping to like chapter 2 more. However, I thought it was worse than the first. It wasn't scary and they tried to add humor, which felt out of place in the moment.This movie wasn't dark or mysterious like the first Insidious film. There wasn't any suspense or intrigue to make me really care about what was going on. In both movies, the characters didn't have much personality to them. I didn't care that much about the first film, but, I did like the supernatural beings. However, the further didn't seem that creepy, compare to the first film. It didn't seem like there was as many spirits trying to possess the people who were there.In the last half, they tried to add humor, however, it just came acrossed as silly. It made the last half, of the movie seem goofy and out of place from the first half.Something I found confusing was the fact Josh was trying to contact two of his younger selves. It made some things that happen in the first movie not make sense. In my opinion , Insidious: Chapter 2 felt more like a drama and action movie, due to the fighting rather than a horror movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Solid Follow Up a Modern Classic,"This film I was excited to check out, but I was a bit disappointed that first time around. I hadn't seen it since that one time after I picked up the DVD. I did now give it a second viewing as part of the Summer Challenge Series over on the Podcast Under the Stairs as this popped up on the 2013 list. Jaime and I also watched this together as she did watch the original with me and it freaked her out. The synopsis is the Lamberts believe that they have defeated the spirits that have haunted their family, but they soon discover that evil is not beaten so easily.We pick this up where the last one left off. Renai Lambert (Rose Byrne) is speaking with Detective Sendal (Michael Beach). He is trying to figure out who killed Elise Rainier (Lin Shaye). The prime suspect is Renai's husband of Josh (Patrick Wilson) and we know that he was the one who did it. He might not be in control of himself though.We then jump to 1986 when Josh was a child, being played by Garrett Ryan. His mother of Lorraine (Jocelin Donahue) is concerned about him, because he is troubled and the doctors don't know why. She decides to go a different route and seek other help. Carl (Hank Harris) shows up with his camera and he calls in a younger Elise (Lindsay Seim being this version) to help. She is a clairvoyant and he is there to film what is happening. They know there is a presence there, but they can't stop it. It is decided to make him forget about it. Before he does, there is a weird instance while the boy is hypnotized and speaks with someone, points and a door opens.We shift back to the present. Josh wants to just forget about everything that happened and move on. Renai is still noticing that they are being haunted. There are pianos playing, a toy turning on by itself and seeing a woman in a white dress with a pale face. The woman isn't very happy either. Lorraine (this older version played by Barbara Hershey) is noticing things as well. Everyone is pretending to not upset Josh.Renai and Dalton (Ty Simpkins), her son, notice there is something wrong with Josh. He heard him talking to someone who isn't there during the night. Renai does what she can to comfort him that everything will be okay. I should also point out, the family also includes another son of Foster (Andrew Astor) and baby sister Kali (Brynn and Madison Bowie).The two guys who helped out Elise in the first film are back in this one as well. Specs (Leigh Whannell) and Tucker (Angus Sampson) go to her house. They figure out that the trouble is still going. They enlist the help of Carl. Together they learn the history of what has happened to this family and see Elise's records about it. They also decide, along with Lorraine, to contact Elise's spirit for help using Carl's blocks. These are interesting as they're rolled like dice but spirits use them to answer questions.They need to figure out the truth of this Bride in Black before it is too late. We see that it is having a physical effect on Josh. It is also pushing him to do things he doesn't want to. On top of that, there is this other ghost, played by Danielle Bisutti, which is quite violent as well.That is where I'll leave my recap and I was to re-iterate that I loved the first one. I didn't know much about it and had low expectations, but it blew me away. This one had some big shoes to fill. What works is that they took what the original did and expanded on it. It ties in things that happened in the first and shows you more of it, which I thought was good. This one gives us more information what happened to Wilson as a boy and it explains what is happening to him now.This will be where I want to delve a bit deeper first. We get to see what Elise says in the beginning when she shows up in the previous movie. Josh doesn't remember as the memories were repressed to help him. We see that this Bride in Black wanted to take him over back then and we get to learn why. Things started to come back to me as this movie went on and it makes it horrific. I brought them up to Jaime and she didn't see the correlation, but this movie does well in explaining it. I also like how they incorporate this other ghost that is attacking Renai and Kali. The investigation here works, but Jaime brought up a good point. There is a time where they go to a hospital that Lorraine worked at and there are still medical records there. This wouldn't happen and they still wouldn't be there. It doesn't ruin the movie, but it is an issue.To shift gears here, this movie does something with time that I'm a sucker for. I'm surprised I didn't like this movie the first time I saw it more as this is something that ticks boxes for me. While in the further, time doesn't move linear and is more of a flat circle. We are able to see events from when Josh was a kid and the truth of what he said as well as who he was talking to. We also get to see a different side of events in the first movie. Some of this really works where other parts I think are just to establish things, but it is still interesting.I do need to move this to the acting. We get a good performance from Wilson. There is the normal version of him that is trapped in the Further and then there is evil version in the real world. I liked to see him play the duality of this character. Byrne is good along with Hershey. They so badly want to help their family and do whatever they can. Shaye is good as well. I'm glad she was cast as this feels like her iconic role. Simpkins, Coulter, Whannel, Sampson and the rest of the cast rounded this out for what was needed in support. I also wanted to give credit to Bisutti and Fitzpatrick along with all those playing ghosts. They are effective with the scares.Something else that was effective was the effects. I like the look of the Further. It is like our world, just black and there is mist. It is similar to purgatory or just where you go until you move on. Many times souls don't. I like that it is bound to the rules of the real world. I like the look of the ghosts. This movie does rely on jump-scares. I will say they are well done. What is more impressive to me is the framing and the cinematography. It is top notch, especially when we will see something in the background or when someone walks past, the entity will disappear. This makes me uncomfortable in a good way.Then finally I want to over the soundtrack. I didn't really remember it from the first time, but it gives us more of the same from the original. This one isn't as strong. We do get more of the stringed instruments like what I'm assuming is a violin. It helps build the atmosphere they're for and build up the tension that is needed. This is well done for sure.So then in conclusion here, I'm glad I gave this a second viewing. This is better than I remembered. It is taking what was done in the original and then building as well as expanding on those ideas. It is coupled with good acting along with framing, cinematography and a solid soundtrack. The movie might rely a bit on jump-scares, but they are effective as well. I have come up from the previous time I've seen this. I would recommend giving it a viewing if you like the original as this is just a continuation of the story. For me, this is a good movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Better than expected for sequel, but loses the magic of the first","The first felt like a complete film - the dynamics between the main couple were interesting, there was a tension that gave depth and emotion to the horror element. The performances and atmosphere were properly attended to and it all worked.In the sequel, the performances, characters and emotional depth are discarded in favour of over-cooking the narrative. It plays out like a TV movie (shot on DV) of something like American Horror Story, where story elements, jump moments and historical causes fly thick and fast.There are too many references to other haunted house films and clichés, The Shining and Psycho. Those latter references (which are extremely blatant) make you wish you were watching a ""real"" film of that calibre, and only serve to highlight how amateur feeling this whole thing is.Leigh Whannels script, whilst over excited does have some nice touches (as well as clunkers), but James Wan's direction felt totally uninspired and rushed this time around.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Boring,"This movie is absolutely boring. It solely relies on cheap scares, the story isn't believable at all and is filled with clichés from other horror movies. The first part of the series was better at delivering horror even though it were nothing more but sudden scares One of the only good things about Insidious: Chapter 2 and the past installment is the music, which is reminiscent of glorious horror films such as The Shining or Psycho. Another aspect worth of mention is the SFX department. It was good to see the use of makeup, camera techniques and creepy settings, instead of the use of too much CGI to create an eerie atmosphere.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Basically an extended cut of the original,"The continuation of the haunting of the Lambert family in 2013's 'Insidious: Chapter 2' was more or less an extension of its predecessor.While the film takes a deeper look into the origin of the Lambert patriarch (Patrick Wilson), it doesn't add a whole lot that's new and relies on similar tropes and jump scares. That said, this approach was effective in the original, so it's not surprising that James Wan tried to recapture lightning in a bottle on round two. Still, it feels like Groundhog Day most of the time in this sequel, and no amount of screentime from Lin Shaye can change this.Here, we do get to see more of Barbara Hershey's Lorraine in action, as the storied actress must get to the bottom of who exactly is haunting her son. There are a few moments that effectively grab viewers' attention (mostly at the expense of Rose Byrne), but they are not enough to make up for the general underwhelming-ness of the film.Horror sequels are typically letdowns, so it's not a shock that the sequel to 'Insidious' suffers this fate.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Things tend to happen when it gets dark...,"Continuing where the first movie left off, part two is actually a brisk step up in pace and intensity. Whereas I wasn't particularly impressed with the first movie, I found part two to be somewhat more fulfilling. It is far from perfect, but it is a step in the right direction.It should be pointed out that you should watch part one prior to watching this movie to fully grasp the concept of the movie and understand what is going on.The movie isn't really scary, but it does build up some nice enough scenes. And it was really a nice touch on director James Wan's part with the way that he tied the events in the movie together in a great continuous flow, and giving you a satisfactory explanation to things that initially leaves you in the dark - literally.Despite the lack of being scary, then ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" is an improvement from the first movie. But personally I enjoy something more spooky, scary and disturbing from a movie in this genre.The people in the movie were doing good jobs with their given roles, and it is nice to see people returning to the characters from the 2010 movie.As for the ending of the movie, well... It was a cliffhanger, sure. And knowing that a third installment to the series in the works, it has aroused some interest in just what it was that spooked departed Elise that much.""Insidious: Chapter 2"" is a definite must-watch if you enjoyed the first movie.But given the lack of scares and actually any scary spirits, then I am rating the movie a mere 5 out of 10 stars.

"If the first was a hit, this one double's it","Horror films are really difficult I think to provide a sequel towards them because audiences are not like expecting a sequel to many of films of the horror genre because to me they seem like one off sagas and a sequel usually expands the original story too much. Well Insidious was great to me and I really enjoyed how different it was. When I first heard about the sequel I certainly didn't want it to happen. After watching the trailer I felt a bit more optimistic about it but not something I would go out of my way to watch to be honest.Later on it got and the reviews and ratings came in and 90% of them where positive which shocked me so I thought I will watch it. So when I did I was so shocked on how it was made. It was fantastic and not a lot of horror movies scared me but this has a terrifying sense to it which James Wan does very well with his films. The style is very similar to the first film such as dramatic music in the background to make the jump scenes even worse. The camera work is the same with the bizarre shots used and the lighting specifics.The second film left my mouth open and I was unsure what actually happened at the very end and this film explains it all. So much detail went into it and it truly explained the origin of the demon that was inside Josh and it blew my mind away from just having the certain ideas in the first film, and then to explain all of them in the second installment. Absolute brilliant. If you are a big horror fan I would recommend this because its truly what horror is about these days and stuff like this will keep the horror genre what it used to be.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"When the mystery is explained, what is there to scare us except the vulgar jump scare?","Following the commercial success of the first chapter, Insidious: Chapter 2 eventually happened. With a lot of hype and anticipation, Insidious 2 arrived. Unfortunately, not with the quality standard of the first. The movie starts well, in an intriguing and mysterious way, but it doesn't take much time to understand what we are going to watch. It tries to be a direct sequel (what audiences normally wants), and thus we are presented with a squeezed new story that intertwines with the one of the first chapter, and kind of explains it, losing all the mystery. Mystery lost, Insidious 2 main weapon is the jump scare, the sudden loud sound effect, the ugly faces. When you understand whats in the dark, what could there be left to scare you? Barbra Hershey is forcefully presented on an almost main role on a plot that is filled with holes. By the end we have a full bag of unimaginative clichés and crappy fantasy, losing all the credibility this Insidious' 2 horror could have.

Decent Sequel,"Insidious Chapter 2 is a frightening, fun, although flawed film. It picks up right after the death of Elise (Lin Shay), and about 20 years ago when Josh (Patrick Wilson) was a boy. Yes, Josh brought something back with him. It was the parasite that stalked him as a boy. It is moving on him. It is moving on Dalton (Ty Simpkin). It is moving on the whole family. In the meantime, Elise's friend, Carl (Steve Coulter) is working with Specks and Tucker to unravel what has happened. It leads them to a a very dark secret about the parasite - or the Black Widow. First, the movie provides good suspense, good scares, and surprises without the menacing music, buckets of blood and gore, and NO CGI effects. It's a good old-fashioned ghost story with mystery, intrigue, and fear. I do have a few gripes. The story's pace is slowed by uneven execution. Between stories of Reyne's suspicion, Carl's endeavor with Spec and Tucker, and Dalton's returning clairvoyance, the story loses cohesion. I was interested in Dalton's take on things (since he was mostly in a coma in the first one). However, his story line is relegated to the back seat to focus on Josh. While Josh's story is interesting, it also takes a back seat to the uncovering of the past secrets of the black bride parasite. Finally, many of the same elements are repeated - some of which defy logic and common sense. Still, it has a familiar family we love, and a great mystery. If you liked the first one, you should like this one - but probably not as much as the first one.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Something he has inherited from his father.

It's not that good is it?,"WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS.Not a great fan of this kind of movie. The people in the movie don't act anything like how a normal mentally healthy person would act. For example, at one point a person with a fair bit of supernatural experience reaches into a dark wardrobe (cliche to the max) when she knows there is a nasty ghostie in there. Was she hoping to shake hands with it? Just dumb. There are many such instances in the film and too many to ignore. The people just seem to accept that violent ghosts that steal children and knock they themselves senseless are in the house far too easily. Sometimes they protest but come on, there's ghosts all over the shop and they are not nice, as if you would just maintain normal sleeping arrangements after your son had been taken, your daughter taken from her crib, your supernatural guru strangled by god knows who, you see ghosts in the form of strange ladies screaming at you as they punch you and your husband is acting a little odd and suspicious.Also it relies heavily on highly predictable jump scares. You know they are coming but the loud noise and sudden shock still makes you jump. Its not clever.The ghost world is really silly. Its pitch black but don't worry, the main characters are well lit for some reason. No wonder the ghosties can see them, with their spooky lanterns that seem standard issue in the ghost universe. Must be a ghost union thing. Oh and there is mist everywhere...ooooohhh spooky mist. Not sure why there is mist but maybe they have other sorts of precipitation too and it's mere coincidence that on this day it was a bit misty in the afterlife.The idea is good and the serial killer that hates his mother for forcing him to pretend he was a girl is creepy but handled poorly. The mother is so over the top see looks like an evil queen from a Disney animation.Not a great film.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Insidious and aggravating,"I'll give James Wan and Leigh Whannell credit for one achievement in Insidious: Chapter 2; if nothing else, at least they didn't mail it in.When it comes to plotting, some follow ups are pure repeats of their predecessors, but for Insidious, Wan and Whannell have managed to build upon some of the makings of the first instalment. In doing so, they have shed a little bit of light into the darker and unexplained portions of the Lambert family's story, and elect to give it the conclusion that the characters deserve; a noble development in a genre where the audience is often un concerned about what becomes of protagonists. Here, unfortunately is where the success of Chapter 2 ends.The second Insidious is one of those films where you can't immediately decide whether it features too much story material, or too little. There is a lot going on in this film, but none of it ever seems to have a focal point. It is a dense film, chaotic and rushed, it features too many figures (both living and dead), flirts occasionally with the dangers of triple timelines and gives its characters almost no breathing room. The film is more concerned with their back stories than it is with their present ones, leading me to think that Insidious: Chapter 2 may have actually worked better as a two hour feature. The climax is especially hectic, and disorienting because of it's pacing and choppy editing.If this wasn't enough, Insidious: Chapter 2 is further crippled by its lack of genuine suspense. The movie is far less scary than it is borderline humorous. Even if Wan has once again respectably avoided copious bloodshed, There is no subtly in either the direction or the script, creating 'boo' moments that might cause laughter.Insidious: Chapter 2, is a sequel that appeals because it promises to build upon its set up, rather than repeat it. Only occasionally does it fulfil this promise. I won't say it was an unnecessary sequel, but there is simply no way it should have been this disappointing.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Insidious is definitely one of the scariest horror movie franchises, so far","First of all, when I first watched the official trailer of the movie I liked it and I had high expectations about it, because I loved the first movie. Eventually, it was as good as I had imagined and I enjoyed it. The plot of the sequel was very interesting, but not innovative because it was kinda similar to the previous movie. The storyline was kinda well-written and well-explained, even though it was simple and easy to understand. The characters were the same as before and gladly, they were still very interesting, well-developed and likeable. The filming location of the movie was, an old creepy house in a quiet neighborhood. The casting was the same as before and their performances were descent. I have to admit, it was as scary as the first movie and there were too many jumpscares. However, the first movie was more creepy and the jumpscares were definitely unpredictable. The opening scene (the flashback) was kinda unpredictable, intense and creepy. The ending twist was definitely unpredictable, but it was kinda complicated, lol. Moreover, the cinematography and the score of the movie were both incredible.

"""Well Needed Prequel/Sequel""","Going to be BRUTALLY honest. I hated the first film. It was downright ridiculous and since I watched it I have repeatedly brought it up as one of the worst films I have seen ! This is why I have only today watched the second film, because I heard a couple rumors that this one made the first a LOT better ! And that I can agree, BIG TIME ! The story to this one is a lot more see-able, and the whole first film (as well as the rest of the second one) is kind of explained in the first 10 minutes and gives a reason as to why things were a little bit ridiculous before. As the story progresses it links in EXTREMELY well to the first and is actually really gripping to see where it'll take a turn next. The scary factor wasn't GREAT, but it isn't needed to make this film what it is. Highly recommend putting yourself through the first film before you watch this one, as it makes the second chapter sooo much better ! This has really changed my opinion of the, I guess, trilogy. And I will be going to see the third one once it is out on Friday and look forward to seeing what the teaser to the next film means at the end of this one, hopefully not bringing the quality of films down again, I am a little skeptical.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
I told you! (Don't you dare!),"I told you guys, two years ago, when Insidious (chapter 1) came through. Here's a part of that review:""There are some cinematographic deliverances that made me enjoy extatically the mastership of Wan when it comes to film. But he didn't relie on his talents, he used other people talents (like Kubrick's The Shining) to deliver a classic horror film. I'm not comparing Wan with Kubrick, but some of the camera works, some of the angles, are truly brilliant, rarely seen in a horror film. This is a movie you can analyze in many levels... ""The fact is that I was right. I saw James Wan's obsession with Kubrick's ""The Shining"" (here's the part where I'm not being humble). This chapter 2, confirms it. I loved this film as much as I loved the first part. I would not argue with those who think this film and The Conjuring are the best horror films this year. They are perfect, though I liked most the Insidious series because I have a sick fanatism for this story in particular.It completed the circle, totally. I hope they won't ruin the third part coming soon. And I beg to Mr. Wan to continue delivering horror movies. This is what suits him. Thanks for this two beautiful classes on horror.Cheers from Argentina.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
real scares,"I was pleased to find that this film was better than the original one in 2010, not trying to be amusing. It was also almost as good as the middle film, The Conjuring (2013). I was not so happy with the use of the dice but there is so much going on around that it is okay. There is not really anything too realistic but I don't like it to be so mixed-up but still fine.

"Almost a good followup, just clunky","Most of the time if sequels to popular movies are not drastically changed, the movie will either perform just as well or slightly below. Even if reviews tend to be fairly low, some sequels continue to push onward. The very best example of this kind of feat is Michael Bay's Transformers (2007) franchise. Insidious: Chapter 2 (2013) is no different. After surprising and/or scaring many with his first entry, horror director James Wan returns to conclude where viewers ended with Insidious (2010). The fact that Wan and writer Leigh Whannell decided to continue the story from the previous film is definitely a plus. For some fans, they might think it wasn't necessary while others perhaps wanted to know how it went down. The question is, is it done well? Well, it requires more than a one-word response.Like many other sequels, the continuation does not stray far from where the last entry ended. Ideally, the main cast of actors return to reprise their roles. After finding Elise's (Lin Shaye) strangled body by her husband Josh (Patrick Wilson), Renai (Rose Byrne) begins to suspect that her spouse is not feeling himself. Not long after, Renai begins seeing more ghostly figures roaming around. Plus Dalton (Ty Simpkins), their son who can dream outside his subconscious, can also notice differences in his father's actions. Once Josh's mom (Barbara Hershey) becomes aware, she calls upon Elise's helpers Specs (Leigh Whannell) and Tucker (Angus Sampson) to find out what's wrong. If this were the plot itself, there would be nothing wrong. However, screenwriter Whannell begins to slip. The reason is that Whannell piles in too many variables for the story to actually hold. This results into a story that has promise but is overly complex for no reason.One unfinished subplot to the story was the police investigating Elise's murder. Initially it starts off like it could go somewhere, however it ends up just going cold and shoots itself in the foot. Apparently the hands that strangled Elise was not Josh's hands. OK so, who's was it? This attacker is revealed later on but not by the police, which brings up the question of why they couldn't accomplish that task. Or why wasn't Josh's handprints on Elise's neck. This is one set of loopholes that doesn't quite add up. Another is that somehow people can still bring physical objects with them into The Further realm. How is that? It's a bit hard to imagine that nonliving objects can dream out of their subconscious too. This flaw also occurred in the first movie, but this time it occurs a little more frequently, thus becoming more obvious.There's also a slight change in the way the plot is executed. The difference is now the execution will act like a crime scene mystery where people look for clues to get answers. This requires digging through files and searching old records by breaking into abandoned infrastructure. Yet somehow, these significant acts do not have an effect on the characters. Are the police that oblivious? However, these errors mentioned are nothing compared to the next biggest head- scratching component to this movie. Whannell actually brings in the idea of time travel and crossing different dimensions in time. For some reason, it feels like there could've been an easier way to get over this hurtle. The idea here is that somehow The Further realm can now access the memories of other people. This in turn ends up explaining past events that have already happened. It's not that this added trait is bad, but it feels like a lazy way of just solving the problem instead of giving a reasonable answer. Reasonable doesn't have to mean logical because The Further concept itself denies that entirely, but it still should have reasonable laws that define it.The acting is still good in this installment. All characters are as they were and still have the same amount of charm as they did before. Patrick Wilson also displays his range of acting by showing what he's capable of. The special/practical effects are still noteworthy too. John R. Leonetti maintains steady cinematography and the ghouls continue to look frightening. With regret, the scares are not as strong as before. The way the story plays out, it'll evoke more chills than scares. An actress by the name of Danielle Bisutti plays a ghost and she is perhaps the scariest thing in the film (although she's not the main villain). Joseph Bishara again returns to score the music for the film and again it is effective when it needs to. This counts for either soft tunes or the stings. Bishara has a way of working the strings with no percussion so that they don't sound so typical for like so many other horror film scores. It can still entertain but not as strong of a performance.There's no doubt that a lot thought did go into making a decent continuation of Insidious (2010). The acting, music, visuals and story are preserved but the screenplay forgets to cover up several of its flaws. Plus it includes methods of deduction that don't quite fit the genre like it should.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good movie,"Insidious brought us the usual haunting story, with a couple new elements sprinkled in. Chapter 2 does a great job of furthering itself from the usual fare, by expanding on the elements that made it different. One on the elements of this franchise is the focus on ""Astral Projection"", which is a person subconsciously leaving his/her body and traveling though a spirit realm (called the ""Further"" in this movie), leaving the body empty until the soul returns. While projecting, the soul can interact with other spirits, good and bad. Chapter 2 picks right up from where the first ended (SPOILER FOR THE 1ST MOVIE! SKIP TO NEXT PARAGRAPH TO AVOID!) - the father succeeds in rescuing his son's soul, but something else has taken the father's body in the process. Is it as scary as the first? That's debatable...if you liked the scares from the first movie, then you'll get a kick out of some of the tension- filled moments in this one. If you weren't a fan, then it'll probably just be more of the same. My opinion - slightly fewer scary moments, but definitely a few quality jumps, perhaps of a higher quality than the first. (There's one 3-hit combo in particular that I thought was really good.) I will say that I enjoyed how the total story has evolved. Chapter 2 adds a few layers to the lore of this franchise that sparked my interests, and gives it some good depth. The script is infinitely better this time around. Patrick Wilson outdoes his previous performance, and I love anything that Barbara Hershey does. We even get a few laughs here and there. And James Wan does well to use the 'common-sense-as-viewers- applied-in-the-movie' technique again. Without giving anything away...when you get a blatant warning, YOU LISTEN TO IT. Sound editing was much better this time around, although they still rely a good amount on the usual dead silence broken by LOUD CRASHES OF NOISE AND CREEPY MUSIC... Overall, Chapter 2 makes several improvements on the first, and while, depending on your tastes, this sequel may or may not be as scary as the first, I think it's tough to deny that this is a all-around better, more entertaining movie. And, being such a low-risk, low-budget project, I'm sure a 3rd movie will be justified. Insidious: Chapter 2 scores a 3.5 out of 5 on the BDBOS. I really liked the first Insidious and though it was suspenseful and creepy, after seeing Insidious: Chapter 2 I thought it was a good sequal taking place after the first.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The horror elements in this aren't as good as the first film and the story is fairly blah.,"Insidious 2 (2013) is currently available on Netflix and continues the story of the family previously impacted by their son being possessed. As the family moves on the mother keeps noticing strange things occurring around the family while the father tries to help the family move on. As more eerie things build up the mother will try to convince the husband they may still have some demons to overcome.This movie is directed by James Wan (The Conjuring) and stars Patrick Wilson (Hard Candy), Rose Byrne (Bridesmaid), Lin Shaye (There's Something about Mary) and Barbara Hershey (Black Swan).The storyline for this didn't feel natural or realistic at all compared to the first film. The movie starts with some awkward behaviors and conversations by the dad and it was weird the wife wasn't picking up on things. The special effects remain out of this world and the settings are very well portrayed and presented.

If they show that deleted scene, that movie would be rated R, instead of PG-13! I would give this movie a 2/10.

As Scary As The First,"I had the opportunity to see both movies back to back at the cinema and it was the ultimate horror experience. Chapter 2 is an absolutely terrifying sequel to one of the scariest movies of all time. This sequel is more visceral and twisted than the first movie.Directly continuing from the first film the Lambert family think the worst is over, but moving into Josh' Mum's home they encounter an even more malevolent and parasitical entity that has killed before and will kill again, and there's something not right with Josh. Once the first film ended with that jaw dropping cliffhanger, I was so eager and excited to find out what would happen next, and the payoff was worth the two year wait. The story in the sequel uses time travel and flashbacks to uncover unanswered questions from before, you understand who and what the old lady is and the past of Lorraine, Josh and Elise. For fans of Insidious every question and open link is connected and cleared, leaving you ready for the scares in store that James Wan has constructed ready to make you scream!My favourite moment of the whole movie is when Renai is sat on the stairwell clearing her head, then mysteriously Baby Cali's toy moves on it's own into sight, the look on Renai's face clearly says ""Oh not again"". She slowly moves into the living room, paces back and forward and behind her sits a lady in white, singing in a sinister manner. Renai turns and Rose Byrne is undoubtedly the best actress for pulling a terrified expression, I felt that terror and I was petrified as the spirit continues singing, and then disappears and heads into Cali's room where you can hear the spirit smacking and screaming at her, Renai runs upstairs to find the baby is gone, and suddenly appears to be downstairs where Renai is suddenly beaten and screamed at by the most petrifying ghoul I've ever seen.Chapter 2 covers more locations and travels deeper into the Further where the undead are even more vicious and desperate to enter living vessels, the characters venture so far they uncover the home of the Mother of Death, played by Danielle Bisutti who delivers a horrifying performance which actually scared the living daylights out of me. This is pure horror, the atmosphere and tone are perfect and the whole world of Chapter 2 seems haunted and uneasy, and yet again the finale is absolutely shocking and had me gripped. Elise who is on the other side witnesses something that we all thought was long gone after the events of the first movie, in comes the gasp and close up and then the titles burst in, I want Insidious Chapter 3, I crave more of this franchise!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Meh... not that great,"The first movie ended with Elise dying, presumably killed by Josh, and this one this movie starts off with the ramifications. The good news is that the son is no longer possessed, but the bad news is that Josh now probably is (by a different demon). The family moves into yet another new house, but Rene once again starts seeing spooky images and entities. This time it seems to be Josh who is possessed, as he now starts exhibiting strange behavior. Josh's mother hire Tucker and Specs, the paranormal investigators from the first movie, as well as investigator Carl, to investigate the circumstances of Elises' death. Once again we learn that demons are to blame.I think to plot from this movie is too similar to the first one. There also aren't as many real scares this time, most of them are just cheap. Also, my biggest complaint of the first movie was that the last act was boring and dragged on too long, and that kind of happens here, but thankfully its shorter this time and the climax is a bit more exciting. The story is just plain confusing at times, like how the humans enter and exit the Further(the spirit world). I also thought Tucker and Specs were really annoying characters.The good things are that we get more of Joshs' backstory this time to explain how he got possessed. We learn more about the spirit world, too. The scares that do work are really effective, so at least there's that.Insidious 2 is nice if you are a horror fan, but those who liked the 1st will probably be underwhelmed by this.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Both scarier and all round better than the first one!,"Due to my disappointment with the first film and my confusion to why it was so over-hyped, I was extremely sceptical about seeing this film, however I left the cinema both surprised and shocked at how terrifying this film really was - this film easily beat 'the conjuring' with it's scares- it left me uncomfortable watching it and that is what a horror film should do, it should leave you worried about what is going to happen next and that is exactly what 'Insidious 2' did.Despite being terrifying and horrifying it also had an extremely thought provoking and quite disturbing storyline - even though it did continue Dalton's storyline in the first installment- it centered on tieing up the loose ends of 'Insidious'. I can now watch the first film with little confusion and more enjoyment.This film is extremely scary and truly amazing and I would recommend seeing it.

natural and beauty,"Insidious: Chapter 2 (2013) is a supernatural horror film directed by James Wan and written by Leigh Whannell. The film is a sequel to the 2011 film Insidious and follows the Lambert family as they continue to deal with the aftermath of their son's astral projection.A Worthy Sequel
Insidious: Chapter 2 expands on the story of the first film, delving deeper into the mysteries of the Further and the family's connection to it. The film's narrative is more complex, with multiple timelines and plot twists that keep viewers engaged.Strengths1. *Atmosphere and tension*: James Wan masterfully crafts an eerie atmosphere, using sound design, visuals, and a haunting score to create tension.2. *Strong performances*: The cast, including Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, and Barbara Hershey, deliver strong performances that add depth to the story.3. *The Further*: The film's exploration of the Further, a spiritual realm that exists beyond the living world, is fascinating and terrifying.4. *Plot twists*: The film's narrative is full of unexpected twists and turns, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats.Overall
Insidious: Chapter 2 is a worthy sequel that expands on the story of the first film.

Awful movie. Can't wait to see the third.,"It really is bad. Very boring with silly scare tactics and a slow, uneventful build to the end. Made worse when you know the film-makers are capable of so much better and the first film was so good.Unfortunately, it's redeemed by the brilliant acting from the entire cast, the story behind the chapter 1 you didn't expect, and the cliffhanger ending. So it pains me to say I am hoping for a third one and for sure I'll be watching it (albeit with low, very low expectations).Definitely watch but be willing to just accept that the first half is pretty much disposable.

Every Horror Cliche in the Book,"There clearly is some talent lurking in the ever present darkness of this franchise, but everything is so layered with tired cliches that it just becomes laughable. This kind of film is scary only if you haven't been watching horror movies the past 40 years. Nothing here comes as a surprise, nothing is truly frightening. It's all too familiar-everything lives in the world of film, not the real world. Wan and Whannell have some good ideas, they just bring nothing original to the telling of the story. You feel like you're watching a copy of a copy of a copy. If that's your taste, dig in. There are talented actors working hard to bring some credible resemblance of life to these films, and for that they're worth watching. That being said, Chapter 2 feels overlong and even more strained to bring the scares than the original, and thus fails more often. Makeup, camerawork, costumes, lighting, music, editing; it's all straight out of the horror film playbook. It's been done much better.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

better than the original one,"To be honest, I didn't liked the first one and I only rated it a 5 out of ten. But this was shown as a preview at a horror Halloween night so I had to watch it but I must say that this flick was over just before you know it.Again directed by James Wan and written by Leigh Whannell (both of Saw fame) and produced by Oren Peli (of Paranormal Activity fame) they have learned from the first one and the critics about it.Before the opening credits you have in fact a prequel of the story of the original Insidious. If you haven't seen the original one don't worry because after the credits in a few minutes all is explained about the first flick, done that this ghost story delivers the creeps until the end. It's done by using almost no extra lighting and doing some shots in POV. It even had a eighties feeling by using a lot of wide angle shots. It's even explained who the ghost was in the first entry of this franchise. We do have ghosts again of course but this time they added a special effect to see the difference of the world of ghosts and the real world, smoke and echo warned you of the ghost world and it worked. Again, it never was scary but this time the ghosts were shown in another kind of movement and also they added some funny situations with the two investigators of the paranormal world. It's also a clear view that Oren Peli did had his influence on part of the directing. At times Insidious 2 did had an paranormal feeling.A funny scary horror that will have you watch the screen full of anger from the first minute until the end. And we all know by now that part 3 is on the way. Who is the girl in the wheelchair and was that a creature towards the end?

Watchable sequel which is preferable to the original,"I wasn't a fan of the first 'Insidious'. In fact, I laughed at some of it and facepalmed through the rest. So, I was understandably reluctant to put myself through another 90 minutes derivative of better horror movies I have already seen ('Amityville', 'Poltergeist' – the originals, of course), and yet, I have to say that I found 'Insidious: Chapter 2' a far superior film. Far from a classic, just short of being goodbut certainly watchable, and even creepy in a couple of places.The plot follows on from the events of the first 'Insidious' (as indeed the end of the first movie sets up) and has the Lambert family once again troubled by malevolent entities. However, thankfully, this time the comical demon from the first film is nowhere to be seen. Instead, the plot revolves around the father's possession by one of the entities from the ""further"" (the netherworld realm where he astral-travelled in 'Insidious' to save his son) and the team of psychic investigators who, along with his wife and child, set out to save him.Now, many chastise the movie for being confusing, and surethe flashbacks and references to the first movie along with the shifts from this world to the ""further"" require a bit of effort to piece together. However, this is no bad thing and I found it a refreshing change from the one-dimensional story of the original. In addition, while the painfully predictable jump-scares annoyed the hell out of me, and some of the ghosts just weren't scarythere were a few moments in the movie which gave off a bit of a chill. Maybe this chill-factor won't stand up to a second viewing, but I'd be lying if I said that I didn't find some of them quite effective first time around.A lot of people credit James Wan with re-inventing the horror genre. I have always found this annoyingly over-stated as his movies are largely style over substance and rip-off virtually every other horror you can think of. Horror auteur he certainly is not, but in attempting something a little more ambitious with 'Insidious: Chapter 2' he has made a decent movie and left me curious about the upcoming third instalment.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

You can't see Insidious 2 without having watched Insidious first. Taught, filled with thrills and horror - you're heart breaks for the boy, Patrick. The one wasted line was Elise's, ""So that's what that was all about."" Pretty sure 99.5% of the viewers figured that out for themselves. See no. 1, then sit back for a true fright fest with no. 2. Can't recommend it highly enough!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Average Sequel...,Well James Wan always trying something new when it comes to directing the horror genre with a unique concept. 1st Insidious is one of my favourite horror film of all time. I have the high expectations from sequel as well and when I started watching the 2nd one the movie starts with a good note and the story follows same as the 1st film it has some good connections where director has smartly connect the sequel with the 1st one but still after a point of time the movie feels less horror and more like a fictional. Screenplay could've been better and maybe there should be more jumpsacres as you are trying to sell the horror part in it. But still it's a 1 time watch movie and you can enjoy as it has some jumpsacres and it's a continuation of the 1st film....,5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Messy,"Well if you havnt seen this yet and want to know how it is, read the reviews with 4-6 stars , they are honest and truly - the rest mostly seem to manipulate the ratingsystemThe things that was bad in the first insidious followed with this chapter 2 sad enough, roamings in spirit worlds , the ghostbusters is back with their nerd toys and byrne still act horrible bad,,, but what is better is the effects and filming , also seem to be more money in this one since the first had a B staple right over itLets also talk about jumpscares, they suppose to be there when you least expect it , not when you know its coming ,, but this is just like the first one an ok film nothing more nothing less.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not matched to the 1st part yet worthy of watching,Elise comes to the rescue even after her death. She helps Josh find the way to his home but this does not happen without struggles. The bride in black makes all efforts to beat Josh and he is almost defeated untill Elise's soul comes for help. It was thrilling and interesting but not all good as the prequel.,8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Praising the Trailers and Script of Insidious: Chapter,"Horror movies often struggle to maintain the intensity and originality of their predecessors, but Insidious: Chapter 2 (2013) is a brilliant exception. As a follow-up to the terrifying Insidious (2010), this film deepens the supernatural mystery while delivering chilling scares and an intricate storyline. What makes this sequel stand out is not just its ability to maintain tension but also the effectiveness of its promotional materials-particularly its trailers-and its cleverly written script.The Trailers: A Perfect Build-Up of Suspense
The trailers for Insidious: Chapter 2 did an outstanding job of building anticipation without giving away too much. Unlike many modern horror previews that reveal all the major scares, these trailers carefully balanced mystery, tension, and eerie visuals. The clips provided just enough glimpses of the ghostly entities and unsettling events to make audiences eager to return to The Further.One of the most impressive aspects of the trailers was their sound design. The unsettling creaks, whispers, and sharp violin screeches immediately set the tone for a nerve-wracking experience. Additionally, the eerie voiceover-hinting at the dark past of Josh Lambert (Patrick Wilson) and his mysterious connection to the supernatural-added depth to the narrative without spoiling key twists.Another brilliant choice in the marketing was the way it tied directly to the first film. By showcasing brief but impactful flashbacks and hints about new horrors lurking in the shadows, the trailers reassured fans that Chapter 2 wasn't just a rehash-it was an expansion of the terrifying story that left audiences haunted three years earlier.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Insidious: Chapter 2 delivers a few decent scares in its first act, but unfortunately the rest of the film is a strangely awful comedy.","Summary: Insidious: Chapter 2 delivers a few decent scares in its first act, but unfortunately the rest of the film is a strangely awful comedy. 40/100 (C-)Insidious: Chapter 2 is directed by James Wan. It was one of my most anticipated horror films of 2013. Wan impressed me so much with The Conjuring, it was memorable, thrilling and well written. Unfortunately, Insidious: Chapter 2 is exactly the opposite, the script is filled with annoying and unfunny jokes, the direction is lazy, the production is cheap and some situations are extremely surrealistic. The opening scene and the first act are quite enjoyable, but there's a horrible lack of suspense and the scares are not so effective. I just can't believe that Wan directed this one, he forgot the most important thing in a horror film... the suspense! A horror film without suspense is utter crap.The first act contains two or probably three extremely creepy moments, but seriously, the rest of the film is a stupid comedy, and it's so rare compared to Wan's previous work. Also, it has an intentionally funny script, the dialog was so cheesy and overcooked. Chapter two is a failed amateurish experiment by Wan and screenwriter Leigh Whannell, it's a joke. It is definitely one of the worst films I've seen at the theater so far. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed some scenes during the first act, but the rest of the movie is just a strange, awkward comedy, literally. I really don't recommend it, maybe two or three moments are worth watching on YouTube or HBO, don't waste your money in this.I'm a huge fan of the first Insidious, it was amazing, even though I had some issues with its final act, it was a solid horror flick with a well handled suspense. On the other hand, chapter two lacks of scares and is short on suspense. Well, at least, the performances are still fine, Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne are awesome as always and the young actors are excellent too. Chapter two boasts an original story and I'm glad that it delivers some fresh ideas to the horror genre, but its execution could have been better and the script could have less unfunny jokes. Moving on, it has a good camera work, Wan gives us some creepy shots, and at times it looks like a James Wan film! But that's not enough.I'm really concerned about this movie, chapter two is a strange flick, I'm not even sure of what it is, maybe an awful mix of genres, such as: comedy and psychological horror. Whatever, it sucks. As I said above, yeah, the plot of the film is quite original, but it doesn't offer enough scares nor entertainment. I really want my money back, this was a truly awful flick. I don't even recommend it for fans of the first Insidious starving for horror, because chapter two is literally a comedy film, a very bad one. The trailer is amazing and scary, but unfortunately all the scenes in the trailer are the best parts in the movie and that's it. In conclusion, chapter two is well acted but it delivers more laughs than scares. (C-)",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than the first.,"First of all, before one watches this movie i strongly suggest watching the first movie, since you need to know the characters and family's background to fully understand this movie. In my opinion this was better than the first movie, which usually never is the case. The movie is jam packed with action and more intense than the first one. Maybe not as many jump scares, but the suspension was there and i could feel it. I love how both movies are kinda jammed together to fully get the small details you couldn't figure out while watching part one. Everyone who is a fan of movies like insidious, the conjuring, sinister etc. should definitely see this one!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"My Review Of ""Insidious Chapter 2""","James Wan's ""Insidious Chapter 2"" continues the story of the Lambert family's nightmare battle against malevolent supernatural forces. The film picks up right where the first film left off moving the story back to the childhood home of Josh Lambert. Wan does a great job of bridging the two films story arch with seamless quality. My only issue with ""Chapter 2"" is the almost grandiose persona that seems to shadow the nature of this family's tale. At times the context and explanatory content seems a bit forced and over-exaggerated even for a fictional film setting. Even in fantasy and fiction the story needs to carry a bit of believability and realism. You need to think that this could actually happen to someone (given that you believe in hauntings and a supernatural presence in the world). Yet at times ""Insidious Chapter 2"" comes off more like those stories that get bigger the longer they are shared among peers, like going to a ""haunted cemetery"" and a sound becomes a presence, becomes an attack and before long someone became possessed and so onThat is how much of ""Insidious Chapter 2"" came off to me personally.The effects and suspenseful thrills in the film are pretty effective. At times the shock value aspects worked perfectly with the sound effects to actually make me jump. There some definite creep elements to this film that manage to pull you into the terrifying even though ""Chapter 2"" carries an obvious overproduced quality. Unfortunately there are times when you should fill spooked or the film tries for an intense chilling moment, it all just falls flat. Over all ""Insidious Chapter 2"" works at carrying this nightmare to the next stage and works in creating a sort of mythos for this supernatural concept. It will scare enough for some fun moments, but it doesn't go far enough to allow for replays of the movie that are just as thrilling as watching it for the first time. So really ""Insidious Chapter 2"" is one of those 50/50 films where it is cool if you like it and it is worth owning if ghost stories do it for you but if you choose to skip it then that is just fine too. I am definitely on the fence about this one. I will buy the DVD because I own the first film but not sure if it will be in rotation during my Halloween ghost story binge because it does walk the thin line between hokey and entertaining.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Highly underrated sequel effort,"Trying to convince themselves the events are over, a family haunted by the spirits of the undead world they traveled to previously are shocked to learn the connection of those events and tries to end them before its' too late.This one ended up being quite the impressive and wholly enjoyable sequel that's just barely above the outstanding original. The main feat here for this one is the fact of going around and finally giving a lot of explanation to what happened previously but doing so through the exploration of the sequences here as there's a lot of that throughout here. That this one manages to exploit this into explaining the few rather curious takes from the first one, namely the initial appearance in the nursery and entering the house which sets off the alarm that never got explained, are given really chilling explanations here and the further reveal here towards the end of what the demon actually appeared to be and why they were haunting the family cause this one to be much clearer about the history behind it's haunting scenes which gives this a really strong feel. That allows for the new scares in here, from the haunting first encounter in the past where it further reveals more answers while giving off the kind of startling jump that's quite impressive overall, to the sequences in the hospital that brings about the rather intriguing use of the dice-rolling for answers that plays a huge part in how the later scenes are built with their attempts to contact the spirit world and leading into the need for the visit to his childhood home that delivers a series of top-notch scares here from the encounter in the girls' bedroom and the kitchen encounter as well as the utterly thrilling revelation behind the secret wall that's one of the most striking and truly chilling scenes in the movie walking through the room to get to the front. Managing to get a lot of great use out of the startling noises and flash-bang jumps, there's some really strong visual sequences here that give this a different look and feel here than what was a part of the other effort, and these are aided nicely by the visit to the dead-world that worked so well in the first effort. As the fast- paced nature of these scenes works their way throughout here, it makes for some truly enjoyable moments that never really derail or lose focus here, and it's not until the finale when it does seem to struggle somewhat here as this is the film's only real problem area. The finale to this is really sub-par, figuring on a series of bungled, rather routine chases around the house that seem intent to keep going merely because the plot dictates that they keep having others rush to the aid in order to keep her from harm when she clearly should've been and comes off as entirely too sweet and cheery considering their history here. As well, it tends to really work as a way of ensuring that the film continues on rather than come up with anything truly original on its own and that does hamper this one somewhat. These here are all that really hold this one down.Rated PG-13: Violence, Language and children-in-jeopardy.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not as fresh and suspenseful as the first,"I was a fan of the first insidious and it gave me some genuine scares with the Darth maul look alike, but they lost the creepiness effect by showing too much of him. I finally got around to this one and it didn't have nearly the same effect as the first one. This could be due to the fact that it used the same formula and many aspects have already become cliché. In multiple instances, I could predict what was going to happen and when a cheap jump scare was going to occur. Also many of the creepy ghosts almost became funny based off of their attempt to be creepy. There also was the added forced comic relief by the duo, which seemed very out of place.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

I am a huge horror movie fan, maybe some people may find this sort of stuff scary, but I really just think it was lame.

"Not as scary as the first, but not terrible","While didn't really like the first movie because it had some bad acting and relied too heavily on jump scares, this movie actually does the opposite. The acting is much better, but the jump scares aren't really there. Kind of odd, really.The first movie was infamous for having a jump scare per minute. Granted, only a couple of them were scary, but it still kept you on edge whether it was scary or not. However, in this film, there is a lot of build up to a jump scare that will never happen. For me, jump scares can still be effective as long as there is a build up to them, and dang, there were a couple great opportunities in this movie that were never fully utilized.Fortunately, this movie's plot does fit in with the first film. Questions left unanswered are answered and characters do return. The duo from the first movie are some of the best, especially during a scene where a ghost warns that it will have to kill them if they stay... and guess what? THEY LEAVE!!! They act like smart people who realize when they are in danger.If there is one little fault in this film (other than the fact that it is nothing but a time-waster) is the fact that there isn't really ever a threat except for one scene. Basically, all of the cast seems fairly safe and invulnerable to danger, unlike the first film where the stakes were higher.All in all, it wraps up the plot and hints at a sequel. It could've been scarier, but it wasn't terrible. Worth a watch at night.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Its saving graces, I think, are slick directing, a fast pace, and an effective horde of screaming, shrieking ghosties.","It's garish, it's over the top, and it's muddled — the kind of film that begs to be lampooned by ""South Park"" or ""Family Guy."" For much of its running length, it's largely a retread of its predecessor. Yet ""Insidious: Chapter 2″ (2013) still manages to be a good horror movie. I'd give it an 8 out of 10.It's pretty damn scary. Its saving graces, I think, are slick directing, a fast pace, and an effective horde of screaming, shrieking ghosties. (White-faced Screaming Abusive Mama Ghost needs to CHILLAX.) If a fright flick makes you jump a bunch of times (and during the daytime!), then you know it's a decent fright flick, right?Patrick Wilson shines. But talented Rose Byrne does little in this film beyond running around with a terrified expression on her face. (It's the screenwriter's fault, not hers.) You see that face she's making in the movie poster? That's her performance throughout almost the whole movie.Did anyone notice that ""Specs"" is Leigh Whannell, one of the initial two unfortunates in ""SAW"" (2004)? (He's also the screenwriter for both films.)This was a good horror movie. If you want a scare before bedtime, see it.https://ericrobertnolan.wordpress.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good Creep-tastic fun,"So when I watch scary movies it's usually with a blanket to shield my eyes with my hands over my ears. This one didn't disappoint. I absolutely loved the pace of this move, and the fact that the ""ghosts"" were ones we all saw. They didn't just jump out of corners to scare us, but were themselves characters in the story.The story starts where the first Insidious left off, and it's a rocking scary roller coaster to the climatic finish.

Blatant remark. But if you DIDN'T like the first I think you'll find the second makes up for some of the disappointment.I went away from the first just a bit bemused. I think it was the fact what you don't see is scarier to me than what you do and this movie seemed to want to show you the demon without living up to any expectations. If you're going to reveal something that's ominously lurking in the shadows it's a brave move and you have to match the fear of when it couldn't be seen... I found the whole thing anti-climactic and I swore off seeing the second before I knew it was going to be made.The second however has actually entertained me throughout. I cannot lie. It's still not funny where it's supposed to be and they still reveal too much of the shadow lurkers, but it's compensated by a much better story and pace.

Its ham-handed attempt to make as much use of the reprising characters as possible is one of the saddest things a sequel has seen since OCEAN'S THIRTEEN,"The Lambert family returns to dig deeper into their connection to the spirited world. Scares ensue right from the get-go, but are nothing more than an insincere sham to set the tone of a film that has far less substance than its predecessor. The premise, however, is interestingly a mixture of a sequel, a prequel and a parallel (which covers events occurring at the same time as the first film). The film seems to be inadvertently broken into halves, the first of which covers Byrne's character and the second covering Wilson's, creating an overall incoherent horror movie. It actually gets pretty interesting during the second half, but when the first half is so dull, it's a lot to expect your audience to be so gracious and maintain an open-mind the entire film. There also seems to be an effort to make this installment ""the happier one of the series"", and the ham-handed attempt to make as much use of the reprising characters as possible is one of the saddest things a sequel has seen since OCEAN'S THIRTEEN.

The Chronology Is Off.,"Insidious: Chapter 2 opens with a prequel rehashing of what we already knew from the first film: that Josh went through a similar experience as his son.Though, it illuminates us about why he lost his memory of those events.Before skipping forward, and taking up the story, where the previous film left off.As an investigation- into the murder of the psychic who helped them get their son back- commences.The main problem with this, though... is that the chronology is off.If only because the actor who plays the kid, has aged significantly.It's been three years since the original film was released.And, while the kid has clearly aged those three years...the film continues on as if it were the week after the events of that film.On top of that...the jump scares- which are about all the other film had going for it- are employed way less effectively here.While the Exorcist influence (that the previous film had) has been lost, in exchange for more of a Poltergeist-like vibe.That gives the whole thing a Nun type of feel.Which isn't exactly a good thing in my opinion.I didn't exactly love the first installation of the series...and this one seems to be worse in almost every conceivable facet.So I'm struggling to understand how it got so much traction in the first place.Because it really is quite basic.3 out of 10.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bedt movie,"""Insidious: Chapter 2"" is a cinematic triumph that solidifies James Wan's position as a master of the horror genre. This sequel to the 2011 original is a meticulously crafted film that expertly weaves together a complex narrative, atmospheric tension, and genuine scares.From the opening scene, it's clear that Wan is in complete control of his craft. The film's prologue, which explores the backstory of the Lambert family's haunting, is a masterclass in building tension and suspense.

Wilson, in particular, is excellent as Josh Lambert, a man struggling to come to terms with his own dark past. Byrne, meanwhile, brings a sense of vulnerability and desperation to her portrayal of Renai Lambert, a mother desperate to protect her family from the forces of darkness.One of the standout aspects of ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" is its ability to balance scares with a compelling narrative. The film's plot is expertly woven, with unexpected twists and turns that will keep you guessing until the very end. Wan and co-writer Leigh Whannell have crafted a story that is both a satisfying continuation of the original and a compelling standalone film.The film's atmosphere is, of course, a major part of its appeal. Wan and his team have created a world that is both terrifying and fascinating, a world that draws you in and refuses to let go. From the creepy old house to the eerie landscapes of ""The Further,"" every aspect of the film's design is carefully calibrated to create a sense of unease and dread.If you're a fan of horror movies, ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" is an absolute must-see.

The Further adventures of the Lambert family.,"After being scared s**tless by a series of spooky supernatural happenings (see Insidious: Chapter 1), Renai Lambert (Rose Byrne) moves her family into her mother's house, but husband Josh (Patrick Wilson)—recently returned from the dark dimension known as The Further—isn't quite himself: his body is now host to the evil spirit of a serial killer known as The Bride in Black.Writer Leigh Whannell and director James Wan's sequel to their atmospheric horror hit Insidious offers up several expertly executed scenes guaranteed to give goosebumps (although there's nothing quite as freaky as Tiptoe Through The Tulips), but the movie as a whole simply doesn't work as well as the original, being a rather muddled affair that jumps messily from one creepy scene to another with little regard for decent storytelling.The film frustratingly plays it fast and loose with its ghostly rules, its characters able to enter the spirit world at whim, or if they're only 'mostly dead' (as Miracle Max would say). Some dreadful attempts at humour from bumbling psychic investigators Specs and Tucker (Leigh Whannell and Angus Sampson) also grate on the nerves.A cliffhanger ending leaves things wide open for the inevitable part three, but I sincerely hope that more attention is paid to the narrative next time around.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
By the number sequel,"I didn't like this film. However, the main reason I wasn't impressed was due to how much I enjoyed the first 'Insidious' film. I found it - amazingly - quite a refreshing (and above all scary) little horror film. Therefore I was hoping for more of the same from the sequel. And I sure got it.Insidious 2 felt like the same film. Everything was the same (apart from a lack of so much Darth Maul towards the end). It just seemed like they photocopied the first film's script, added a couple of 'flashback scenes' and turned it out as a new movie.To be honest, there's nothing wrong with Insidious 2. It has scares, i.e. a few loud noises that make you jump and the ghostly effects are reasonably creepy. However, so was the first film, therefore I was hoping for a little more than simply a 'rehash.' No one can accuse the franchise of straying from the formula. That's 'Chapter 2's' main problem - it's too similar. Now it just feels like a hundred other formulaic horror films that get offloaded straight to DVD.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
A sleeper hit with an unnecessary sequel.,"Insidious did something that a lot of horror films love to do. Make a low budget cool concept creep into the zeitgeist of what scares people and start a new franchise. Insidious did a fairly good job with the astral projection idea and took something so low budget and made it into culture.But then the second one comes a long. They try to do too much instead of less is more and end up almost making a mockery of itself. I can see this almost getting the comedy tag from the amount of people laughing at the really bad jump scares, the cheesy dialogue, and the misplaced comedic relief.It tries too hard to be more in-depth and it just misses the mark. They try to amp up the reveals and use a higher resolution camera and it just didn't work. You either do less is more with lower quality or you have to make a spectacle for theaters with something higher quality. This film is somewhere in between. If you are not easily scared, you will laugh at this all the way through.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
James Wan Makes Another Boo Boo....,"Having seen some bad films from Wan lately, Insidious and The Conjuring I should've expected the streak to continue.The film continues from the end of first film, Insidious.

He is planning to murder all of them soon. However his plans are foiled when his wife visits Elise's colleagues, Specs and Tucker to seek an explanation behind the strange events. They call Carl, who attempts to contact Elise using word-dice.This film uses the same plot device of limbo-like dimension or realm called the further(Insidious 2011). It appears that when you die, you get access to this dimension, whether you are in heaven or hell, irrespective.The film shifts between the two planes earthly and the further as the film progresses. The opening and development of the film is boring and if you have an android phone or PSP at hand, your mind will wander and you will start to fiddle with these. This time Wan doesn't torture us in the same level as the first film - He places a mattress on the floor before he trips you.The sound effects are atrocious as the first film. Guys who are using pacemakers should avoid this movie for their health's sake(or life for that matter. Reason is that at points in the film there are blaring noises or ""loud sound effects"" designed to scare you. Special effects in the film are below standard compared to most Hollywood films released these days.The cast of this film is the weakness, as none of them really shine out and try to lift this film.

As far as I'm concerned he's yet to make a bad movie and a couple ('Saw' and 'The Conjuring') are masterpieces of the horror genre. Sadly I don't think either 'Insidious' movie has quite reached that level but that's not to say they're not very good horror movies. I will be very interested to see how he handles the jump across to the action genre with his upcoming 'Fast and Furious 7' and hope he returns to horror soon after because he's damn good at it.'Insidious: Chapter 2' doesn't change much up from the original. It continues the story from pretty much exactly where the first one left off. The opening scene is captivating and brilliantly interlaced with the rest of the film as we learn more and more about what is going on. The scares are plentiful and rarely fail to deliver - some excessively.Since the success of 'Paranormal Activity' a lot of filmmakers seem to be taking a stab at the ghost/demon based films. The most effective so far have been 'Paranormal Activity' itself and as previously mentioned 'The Conjuring' but the two Insididious movies would have to be a close third. The ending of this one leaves an opening for another sequel which I understand is already confirmed and I say bring it on.,8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than the first? :O,"A number of reviews are stating its better than the first film in the series, and I agree! As I said in my review of #1, the purpose of a film (whether or not the plot is 'rehashed' or whatever you want to call it) is to draw you in and make you FEEL the movie; the more flaws the movie has, the more you detach. This movie definitely makes you FEEL it, and mostly through an excellent story.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

A haunting game of Yahtzee,"With ""Insidious"" being arguably the best horror film of the past decade, ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" had an impossible task to live up to. So no, ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" isn't as innovative or nearly as scary as the original (while, it is funnier). And yes, there are moments of silliness that I can't defend. Oh, and I would suggest that one watches the original in order to fully understand the storyline of Chapter 2 (which is: After something follows Josh Lambert out of the spirit world, his family must uncover his mysterious childhood secret before it's too late). But with that said, ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" is a more than worthy successor, as what it lacks in story, it more than makes up for in creativity; while still having an understanding that for a scary movie to work, at the very least, it must be scary.Side Note: For those who disliked ""Insidious"" on the basis that the ""astral projection"" aspect was ""too convoluted"", you should be aware that director James Wan and company only add another layer of weirdness and campiness and over-the-top-ness to the plot of ""Insidious: Chapter 2""; especially when it takes a grand leap from the horror genre, to heavy science fiction, in the final act.Excluding ""The Godfather: Part 2"", the worst kind of sequels are the ones whose sole purpose are to explain or extend its predecessor, using a back-story plot line. And while this may not sound like a flaw on paper, during said sequels the effective idea of the original soon becomes muddled, as the plot is stretched beyond its means and begins to fully focus on expanding the original, rather than giving the viewer a fresh story. And while ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" should be considered an extension of its predecessor, and it does look to expand on the original, Wan, with the help of a highly creative script, has essentially created a new story which uses the ""Insidious"" outline as more of a jumping off point, than anything else.Patrick Wilson (who has certainly become Wan's muse) does good work here, displaying his ability to play a menacing Norman Bates type. And as I alluded to before, Leigh Whannell's script is extremely well constructed (even whilst delving down pathways that are more than a little eccentric) but it's the direction that sells ""Insidious: Chapter 2"". With great camera work throughout, that eerily aggressive score which stands as the signature of a Wan production and moment after moment of either suspense or disturbing images (especially for a PG-13 film) Wan's direction is on point as usual, as he now stands as the best horror director working today. Even if you know the scares are coming, even if you've seen these horror tropes before (as recently as a month ago with ""The Conjuring"") his direction is so effective that it would be extremely difficult not to become lost in the moment and jump out of your seat along with everyone else in the theater.Final Thought: I understand that horror cynics have been blindly picking this movie apart, even going so far as to lie and say that it wasn't entertaining. And while I won't argue that ""The Conjuring"" was (ever so slightly) structurally the better of the 2013 Wan movies, that doesn't change the fact that I unapologetically enjoyed ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" more so. Therefore, if you are a horror fan, and wish to partake in a scary/entertaining night at the movies, then ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" is a must see.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

Great follow-up,"Insidious: Chapter 2 (2013) is the continuation of this franchise and while it's not as strong as the first movie, this was still a great way to continue the story for the most part.Positives for Insidious: Chapter 2 (2013):
I liked the ideas that James Wan and Leigh Whannell came up with to follow-up that original movie. I like how they wanted to expand upon the further and all of the entities that inhabit this place. The performances from the cast are still very good. The villains of Mother and Peter Crane were pretty creepy and have some scary moments throughout the movie. And finally, it was cool and shocking to see a cameo from a very young Jenna Ortega, who is now one of the best Scream Queens and biggest stars in Hollywood today.Mixed for Insidious: Chapter 2 (2013):
The loud booms were really annoying, but I'm willing to forgive them because the rest of the movie was great.Negatives for Insidious: Chapter 2 (2013):
There is a bit of wacky execution with the ideas for this movie and at times were very confusing and bizarre. Also, the heartfelt moment with the Lambert family was ruined by Angus Sampson being comedic.Overall, Insidious: Chapter 2 (2013) was a great sequel to a fantastic horror movie and while it might have some flaws, I was still invested in the story.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great sequel to the previous movie,"This is the pretty great sequel to the first movie. The story is somewhat similar to the first movie with strange haunting that happened to the Lambert family. Now, the scenes with the Lambert family are similar to them encountering strange things happening, but Josh is acting strange. It's mostly the same type of things, but I do like the build-up with the mother discovered that Josh isn't really him. The other plotline is the other characters investigating the paranormal and searching for answers on who the spirits are. It's pretty interesting to learn about the locations they were sent to and the stiff they find in it. Also, it gives backstories to spirits, which are interesting and disturbing. The climax is similar to the first with them in the The Further, but I do like the suspenseful of it and the possessed Josh attacking the characters in the physical world. Also, the ending seems to be forgotten. The characters themselves are a mixed bag in this movie. The special effects are still pretty good in this movie. I like the makeup effects on the villains of the movie , giving them a creepy appearance and them having an interesting backstory to them. The further looks the same, but they added in new things in it and how it connected to the previous movie.Insidious: Chapter 2 is a pretty great sequel to the first movie that I enjoyed watching it and is recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Better than the first,Insidious 2 has an amazing storyline and links up well with the first film.The monster has an interesting storyline and we are told why it did the murders.Also the characters are not as stupid as you would think horror characters normally are as when some encounter a strange experience they basically run away which most would do.My only problem with this movie is that there are some scares what are a bit goofy and are funny.Overall the second in my opinion has a better story than the first and solves a lot of plot holes from the first film. That is why insidious chapter 2 is a.9/10 = surprisingly amazing horror.,9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Bride In Black, You Scared Me To Death!!!","This movie is extremely terrifying!!! AAAAAAAA!!! It didn't give me time to even breath, at ALL! Damn you Bride In Black!!! Why are you so frightening, huh??!! Yes, your face and your voice! Everything! I hate you!!! You made it. You scared me to death. Damn! As if yesterday was our date, me and you together in the middle of the night.Well, actually, I was disturbed by a few scenes from the previous movie. It's kinda boring to see the same acts again. And adding a fact to the previous story, like the one who knocked the door so hard is surprisingly Josh, is a little confusing. It made me think deeper, how could this happening? Why Josh is in the past and in the present? Does he has two souls? But then I didn't give a damn about all this and just enjoyed the movie. God, it was so awesome. I've never seen a horror movie being made so great like this. The music is so amazing, only sometimes it's too loud I had to turned down the volume.I'm really looking forward to see Bride in Black in the next installment. Oh, I was so lucky to have Elise there. She's like my guardian angel in watching horror movie. See you too, Elise.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Scary but disappointing,"This film continues to explore the Lambert family's connections with the world beyond our own.The first ""Insidious"" was outstanding because it had a simple and straightforward plot, and yet it delivered the scares and thrills. ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" develops from there, but the plot is more complicated. The human world and the further merges, and it could become confusing for some. The addition of a psychopathic character and a grossly perturbed mother may have heightened the thrill, but puts me off because it destroys the simplistic beauty of the first plot.The scenes leading to yet another sequel is entirely unrelated to the Lamberts and is just so contrived. I am slightly disappointed by ""Insidious: Chapter 2"", even though I was scared by it.",,Anonymous,Horror
The Back To The Future 2 of Horror,"Tobe Hooper made the often-cited scariest movie ever made, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. For twelve years, fans demanded more but how could Hooper top what was claimed perfection? A balls to the wall parody of the original was the only way to find new insanity.Horror tag team Wan and Whannell struck the same success, almost 100 times profit on their budget. Insidious 2 was a no-brainer and although they don't go for broke like Hooper, this sequel possesses the formula of the original with entirely bizarre new life. Constantly teasing those similar moments of cleverness found in the first Saw, Insidious 2 addresses the first and instills new meaning behind some of the scares.Much like the first, there is an even more apparent mix of warm familiarity and strange originality. Working with classic conventions of haunted houses and possessions, the Insidious films have an old school feeling. Not just reminiscent of the similar Poltergeist but even further back to Méliès and Wiene surreal theatrics of silent horrors. Even if you aren't part of the masses who jump at every piercing stinger of the dilapidated score, there are plenty of kooky visuals that make exploring the afterlife fun.As for the story, this is where the sequel falls short of the initial success in less is more. If you were critical on that third act turn to more Beetlejuice-esque antics, then this one delivers that in spades. With multiple stories all interweaving through time and worlds, the intense engagement of the first is diminished noticeably. While unabashedly fun, it becomes harder to relate to the continued hauntings of the Lamberts.Patrick Wilson is delightfully hammy, genuinely performing as if he were a spirit excited to torment people once again in the living world. Unfortunately, his standout delivery leaves the always wonderful Rose Byrne and the rest of the cast looking clueless as to his not-so- secret condition.The elegant subtitle of Chapter 2 perfectly encapsulates the film. Very much a straight-forward continuation of the first Insidious, but building on fresh and entertaining elements only introduced late into Chapter 1.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Finally, a good Sequel!","I'm back and busier than ever, but that doesn't mean I don't have time for a quick movie review. Hello Robbie K back with another movie review this time on the latest horror movie sequel Insidious 2. As many of us know, the world of sequels is usually lacking, especially when it comes to the horror genre. Usually the scares and creepiness that we loved in the first movie has grown old and stale, often warped into a stupid, cheesy piece of work that is more humorous than scary. So when a sequel to a great movie like Insidious was announced I cringed at the possible trash that could come out, though with director James Wan returning to project I had some hope that we would get something good. What is the verdict? Read on to find out.Insidious 2 starts as a miniature prequel, reintroducing the world we fell in love with and warming up the audience to the creepiness and scares that await. Jump back to the present where we continue the tale that we left off, again helping us get reacquainted with our old friends the Lamberts, who are trying to move on from the past terror. Not one night after moving in do the ghosts start their antics again, working to scare the heck out of the audience. Wan and crew once again put their imagination to work, and succeed in bringing both scary and creepiness together into a beautiful balance. Like its predecessor, Insidious 2 uses the setting as a pallet for the imagination to paint on, often using subtle sounds, unique camera angles, and that ivory-laced music to raise the hair on your neck. A slight glance of a passing silhouette, something moving in the shadows, or a light fixture licking come together to set the mood before the jump factor comes out of no where, making many audience members screaming. While these effects have grown stale for me, I still appreciate the work the team has put together, and how well edited it is to make a film that will make many scream, which may provide some laughs as well. Make no mistake my friends, Insidious 2 will provide the scares you've been craving since the Conjuring.If you've read my reviews, then you must know that scare factor isn't the only thing I look for in a movie. For this reviewer, story is also important and Insidious 2 has a great plot indeed. As mentioned before, continuing a horror story is hard to do, but Wan meets the challenge again, this time managing to tweak the story to explain some things that were left unanswered. Who is old woman? What happened at the end to Josh? How about some of those scenes that were so vague in the first one? All of them are answered, and so cleverly integrated into the first one that many fans will gasp at, or perhaps scratch their head in confusion. Insidious 2 has the ability and twist to make you say, ""What are you kidding me?"" as another piece of the puzzle is revealed. While I was able to predict the movie, just from how many things I've seen, the surprises this movie have are a fresh approach that I've waited for someone to show me. The tale has some mystery to it, having all of the characters, both new and old, working to uncover the truth behind the hauntings. Throwing in the suspense, use of shadow, and all the other factors I mentioned before results in a tale that has you wondering what Wan has in store next.Insidious 2 also has other aspects that made it a strong horror movie sequel. For one thing the comedic relief from characters Specs (Leigh Whannell) and Tucker (Angus Sampson), two geeks who join the crew in hopes of living up to their mentor Elyse's noble legacy. While they do help provide some suspense, this dynamic duo had me in stitches with their casual dialog timed perfectly to relieve the stress. Unlike other movies, I felt their comedy wasn't too stretched or overacted, which made it even better. Aside from the comic relief, the acting for the crew was good, all characters having an equal spread across the film so that everyone got adequate time with the cast. The lovely Rose Byrne did a nice job as always, but this movie her character was a little bit stupider and over exaggerated so I can't say she was my favorite. Patrick Wilson captures the creepy intensity of a possessed victim, though his screaming and actions during the climax are a bit laughable, especially when you realize what movie they are referencing. The rest of the cast did a great job too, but I'm running out of room so let's move on to one last thing.The makeup and design of the ghosts is incredible, the evil ghost (Danielle Bisutti) is pale, creepy, and gloriously brought to life. It was quite welcoming to see a ghost that was creepy, and not one that looked like a luchador pedophile (Red Demon). However, the biggest props go to the makeup transformation of Josh (Wilson) whose progress is incredibly detailed and sculpted to represent the thing he is decaying into. I can't say too much more though, but those who value the art of make up will hopefully appreciate the work put into this movie.So if you haven't guessed yet, Insidious 2 is a sequel worth checking out. It's got scares, story, and laugh, all brilliantly captured and edited to make one great film. Don't let the fear of crappy sequels stop you from seeing it, and make sure to bring a friend who jumps so you can get extra entertainment.I give this movieHorror: 10/10 Movie Overall: 9.0",,Anonymous,Horror
"Retains the original's ambiance, a sturdy sequel.","After being trapped in the afterlife a father must return to save his family from a serial killing entity or be lost forever.Opening with an exposition flashback and picking up where part one left off director James Wan delivers another afterlife visual treat. This sequel has its share of shrouded corpses, ghostly figures, an abandoned hospital and dilapidated houses to name a few.Thankfully this is not some cheap cash-in. What's engaging is that the original cast return including the solid Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne along with Elise Rainier and Barbara Hershey in their supporting roles. Worthy of note is The House of the Devil's (2009) Jocelin Donahue as Hershey's Lorraine younger self. To the casting directors credit the supporting actors who play the younger characters are successfully integrated. Of course for a bit of relief and grounding from Tucker (Angus Sampson)and Leigh Whannell's Specs who also return.It's stylised make-up of the ghostly faces and cross layering between and afterlife, flashbacks, spiritual time paradoxes are finely executed. While it has its fair share of creepy moments, notably a scene involving a tin can make shift telephone it's debatably not as tension filled as the first instalment. That said, with a few twists and interesting exposition it keeps you on your toes from start to finish.What makes Chapter 2 shine is that writer Leigh Whannell expands the story building on his and Wan's original concept without changing it too much, it really is a satisfying sequel and incorporates even some of the original's scenes. Both cinematographer John R. Leonetti (Sleepy Hollow) and composer Joseph Bishara also return which again is in keeping with the first, retaining its atmosphere and look.Granted it's packed with horror clichés but Wan's execution and style gives this an edge over similar types of horrors. Overall, while not reinventing the horror wheel, it's a satisfying follow-up.",,Anonymous,Horror
A Highly Predictable & Forgettable Sequel That's Severely Lacking In Plot & Character Development,"At its time of release, Insidious was hailed by numerous critics & viewers alike as one of the finest works of contemporary horror, a consensus I didn't agree with at all. For me, it had the ingredients to finish as one of the most effective chillers, not to mention that its first half was a masterwork of tension building but, thanks to the utterly ridiculous & laughable set of events that unfolded in the next half, the entire experience was pretty much ruined.Insidious: Chapter 2 suffers from the same issues that plagued its predecessor, in addition to a few more. James Wan once again succeeds in establishing an unnerving atmosphere and employs both camera & sound to good effect but it lacks the freshness of the original, its storyline is predictable, and the surprises are few & far in between, not to mention that its moments of tension don't linger for long unlike before, thus diminishing their impact by an extent.Picking up right where the first film left off, the story of Insidious: Chapter 2 follows the Lambert family as they relocate to a different house while police investigates everything that transpired at their previous residency. Soon, the family comes to realise that whatever was haunting them back in their old house has followed them to the new place, and with Josh exhibiting strange behaviour, the ladies take it upon themselves to get to the truth of all this & end it for once n all.Directed by James Wan (best known for Saw & The Conjuring), Insidious: Chapter 2 begins with a prologue that covers the part that was only hinted in the previous chapter while also playing a key role later in the story. Numerous moments tie up with events that were left unexplained in the first chapter but it still doesn't pack a strong punch this time. The tone is darker than the last time and suspense builds up quickly too but the story just isn't engaging enough on an emotional level.The look n feel of the first film is skilfully duplicated but just like before, all the scenes taking place in purgatory realm are facepalm-inducing. The ghosts look funnier than frightening, and the scares work best only when the poltergeist activities are ongoing. Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, Lin Shaye, Barbara Hershey & Ty Simpkins return to reprise their previous roles but their performances aren't any better than the last time plus the characters remain just as uninteresting as before.On an overall scale, Insidious: Chapter 2 works in bits n pieces and is able to use its setting & eerie atmosphere to desired effect at times but it is so predictable & lacking in surprises that just sitting through this sequel is a tedious job in itself. The non-linear narrative structure fails to conceal the shortcomings in its plot & characters and the negatives outweighs the positives by a considerable extent this time. Fans of the original may find a few redeemable qualities about this second chapter but for me, Insidious: Chapter 2 is instantly forgettable.",,Anonymous,Horror
