Somehow manages to be funnier than the first!,"I really liked the first movie, and I think I like this one more. It's certainly both darker and funnier than the first. This time though, Ron gets the most laughs(""OK can we panic now?""). Here we get introduced to new characters, the standout being Kenneth Branagh, a Shakespeare veteran, who stole every scene as Gildaroy Lockhart. I loved it when he said ""It's filthy down here,"" the whole cinema were in hysterics at that. Jason Isaacs was menacing too, and Dobby was hilarious with his constant head-banging. Daniel Radcliffe is audibly older here and it does work at its advantage. I thought 23 year old Christian Coulson as Riddle was very good indeed, though Riddle was much scarier in the book. Other scenes of comic relief were provided by Ron's parents, played respectably by Julie Walters and Mark Williams. However, there were still some frightening scenes, and the plot at times seemed to be convoluted. Richard Harris was surprisingly good, considering he was ailing quite visibly, and some months later he sadly died. This movie is fairly faithful to the source material, and manages to have a bit of humour too. All in all, a dark and funny movie. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
I want more!!!,"Chris Columbus said he wanted to make a 2,5 hour movie that feels like 30 Minutes. Well, in my case he surely succeeded! I saw the movie as a member of the press and couldn't get enough of it. I would have gladly sat in the cinema for another two or three hours with a biiiig smile on my face.Like part one, ""chamber of secrets"" stays true to the book. I don't know about you - but I HATE it when movie makers change the storylines, add or remove characters and do it for the ""sake of the art"". I think they do it because they are too lazy to create their own storys, so they rip off other peoples ideas and crush them to make it more comfortable... If a book is loved by millions of readers there must be a good reason for that. Chris Columbus has captured the essence of the book on screen. So, after ""philosophers stone"" he delivered again!When reading the book I always envisioned Michael Crawford playing Gilderoy Lockhart. His broad smile and clumsiness Ã  la Frank Spencer would have been perfect for the role. But instead we get to see Kenneth Branagh, so of course you won't see ME complain. The great find of the movie is Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy. In his short scenes onscreen he makes your blood freeze. And again: all the casting is brilliant. Every character just feels right - even if you imagined something different when you read the book. There also has been talk about the young actors getting older. Well, let me remind you that this also happens in the books. In every book Harry Potter and his friends are one year older. So there's no excuse to take the roles away from Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint. I couldn't imagine someone else playing their parts.Go see ""the chamber of secrets"". It's pure fun and excitement! And it will wet your appetite for more to come. Richard Harris couldn't have asked for a better movie and legacy to be remembered by.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
That bit of magic returns,"The second installment seems to carry on where the first left off. All previous characters return and then some!! The grandiose majesty of Harry Potter continues with new tricks, new delights and little treats that can be taken for granted. At times I find the Harry Potter world has so many wonderful things happening at the same time that you tend to overlook the smaller things (ergos the Weasley's residence and the great Hall) The Chamber of Secrets is a darker tail but is well within the tolerances of most children's ability to handle. The creatures are excellent, the overall story is easy enough to follow, though some aspects have to be explained to younger children.What does get annoying is that constant overused Daniel Radcliffe cheesy smile. It wears on the sensibilities after a while like sharp finger nails scraping down a blackboard. Overall though, Chamber of Secrets is a solid good natured magical movie only slighter less pleasing than the first.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"A wonderful journey into a world where magic is, indeed, real.","Having three daughters I have a choice when a great book comes out:  buy three of them (EXPENSIVE!!), force someone to wait until the other is done before they can read the book (sure, I enjoy breaking up fights!), or read it to them.  I chose to read it to them so we could ALL enjoy it...and we did!  Naturally, the kids were excited when the movie came out.  However, when I saw the first Harry Potter, I was terrified it was going to be ""butchered"" like most ""books to movies"" are; but was pleasantly surprised by the relatively ""stick to the book"" script it displayed.  Sure, some things were left out undoubtedly due to time constraints, but overall, it conveyed the story well.Chamber of Secrets did this even better.As an avid reader, I am quite hesitant to see my beloved books displayed on screen only to have the directors do them no justice.  However, with both Harry Potter movies, the visuals were spectacular, the acting well done, and the characters almost perfectly matched.  The set design for Diagon Alley and the Weasley house was fabulous!  How wonderful to see these places come to life outside of our imaginations!  This stays true for nearly every aspect of Hogwarts...from the greenhouse, to the moving staircases, the dorms and Dumbledore's office.Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson do superb jobs of playing Harry, Ron, and Hermione.  The movie undoubtedly draws you in and makes you forget that this isn't real...quite an acheivement!Of course, not all moviegoers will enjoy this one.  It is not for the die-hard action fan, the horror-only fans, or those that dislike a bit of magic, imagination, and fantasy.  But for the rest of us, Chamber of Secrets accurately depicts what until now, only our imaginations could see. Children will love this for the wizardry and magic, the struggle between Harry and his foes, the friendships that abound, and the simple fun of it all; while adults will love it for bringing them back to a time when magic was, indeed, real.All in all, I give this a 5 out of 5...fantastically done.  Of course, I would have liked to see a bit more scenes from the book added, but I understand time restrictions.  Great film and a definite must see!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Darker fantasy than the first Potter film...brisk despite its length...,"Prepare yourself for a darker fantasy this time with some harrowing and scary special effects. Apparently J.K. Rowling has hit upon the fact that kids love to be scared stiff along with being entertained by touches of humor and excitement--although I think her imagination works overtime on scenes like the vomiting fit for Ron, one of the more tasteless sequences.And apparently the makers of this Potter film have met the challenge of providing spiders and snakes that are hideous enough to have Ron and the audience in a fit of hysterics. It's all here--the main events anyway of the Rowling book--and for extra measure they've given a much needed humorous role to Kenneth Branagh who has great fun with his role as the self-loving Gilderoy Lockhart. The only real drawback is that Maggie Smith has very little to do--but the main chores belong to Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint who continue to charm as the three leads. Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy has a commanding presence and an amusingly wicked final scene involving the computer created Dobby who steals every scene he's in.Should keep Potter fans happy--and for a movie two-and-a-half hours long it moves along at a brisk pace from one adventure to another with what by now appears to be mechanical skill, thanks to artful direction by Chris Columbus who knows how to keep this sort of thing moving. John Williams' perky score is a distinct help.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The story starts here!,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a huge step on from the first film.  In the Philosophers stone we were introduced to the the world of Harry Potter and given a taster of what lies ahead.In the Chamber of Secrets the main story line for the series of books really starts to be told.  It is much darker and sinister than the first film and Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint give good performances and give us a glimpse of the fine actors they are becoming.Kenneth Branagh and Jason Isaacs are perfectly cast as Gilderoy Lockhart and Lucius Malfoy and truly bring the characters from the book to life.  Mark Williams as Arthur Weasley while under used in this film is going to be great in the next few as his character has more to do.  The Cinematography is again superb and somehow the Quiddich game is better than in the first film.A fine sequal to the first film and should dispel any notion that the first one was just a one hit wonder.A firm 10 in my book.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Chamber of Secrets has been opened at long last!!!!,"Lessons learned since the 1st film! Clearly this film was edited at script stage rather than the cutting room floor stage!! This story reads as film narrative, rather than a book illustration, which was the big mistake of the 1st film. Anyone can watch this film and follow it without knowing the book. The 1st hour is pure laugh out loud fun (the adults in my Cinema audience were shouting with laughter!). The last hour is scary, wand dropping tension.The problem is: how do we convince muggles put-off by the 1st film to go see this one? Why should they give this one a chance? Answer: If you know someone who likes Fun, make them see this film! This film is not about 'Oscars' & Acting, despite the fabulous performances by all the adults, it is about enjoying the overall effect of the film, this being to give the viewer a long lasting buzz. Brilliant! The staging is very theatrical in it's minimalism, yet extravagantly arty in visual specifics. In the not to distant future I see fans going to a regular weekend slot at their local cinema for Audience Participation fun. Wands, swords, sorting hat, spiders, mandrakes & crucial ear muffs as standard props! Lots of gaps for us to shout out funny quips. A Rocky Horror Show Audience Participation Show for kids! Long overdue.My Rating: 8/10. Not a masterpiece of cinematic potential, but such jolly good fun that no one should be denied the joy of a ""Bloody Marvelous"" frolic. A film for the child within us adults. Go see it with a predominantly adult audience if you want to experience the real buzz of unfettered emotion. Only three children were present at the Preview I witnessed and they were silently spellbound whereas the adults evoked emotion noisily throughout and then stood up, cheered and applauded at the end! I shall never forget this truly magical experience.Richard Harris you can not be replaced, you will always be Dumbledore, and hence Omnipresent. Thank you for the fantastic finale to a wonderful life that you gave us. Thank you. And Thank you JK & Chris. You did it, the Chamber is well & truly open now!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Star rating: 4 out of 5,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is much darker and more insidious in nature than 2001's Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.  This is not meant as a criticism; indeed, it is partly due to the undercurrent of menace, that this second filmic journey into the wizarding world surpasses its predecessor in terms of quality, enjoyment and heart-in-your-mouth scares.  While it is funny and light-hearted in places, it doesn't gloss over the unpleasant aspects of life, and deals with racism in particular.It is Harry's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, but owing to a blocked up wizarding portal, a flying Ford Anglia, and a whomping willow, the beginning of the term is far from ideal.  Then Harry begins to hear voices in the walls of the school; voices that no one else is aware of. It would seem that the fabled Chamber of Secrets has been opened, and that the horror residing within has been unleashed upon the students.It is nice to see how the young actors have developed their roles, although Ron's (Rupert Grint) slightly overdone comedic style would perhaps be more suited to stage performance.  The real stars of the film however, are not the actors, but the wonderful and intricately detailed sets.  From Hogwarts' gothic cathedral, to the glorious muddle of the Weasley household (complete with self-washing dishes and self-knitting jumpers), to the grime and nastiness of Knockturn Alley, the built sets are far more impressive than the CGI wizardry.   In particular, the Quidditch match takes far too long and isn't really all that exciting.  Having said that though, the computer-animated outsize spider sequence will likely scare the socks off small children, and probably even some parents as well!",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Back to school, Mr. Potter: a superior second installment","Having done a good job with the first Harry Potter flick, one shouldn't be surprised Chris Columbus was asked to direct the sequel as well. And the second film actually improves on its predecessor, getting a little edgier and less children-friendly (two factors that raise exponentially with each new installment), even though it does repeat an old mistake in certain places.So, what about the plot? Well, it's Harry's (Daniel Radcliffe) second year at Hogwarts, and everything should be fine, given he defeated Voldemort in the previous film and there are no other threats lurking in the magical world. Or are there? A mysterious house elf named Dobby seems to think so, as he repeatedly tries to prevent Harry from returning to school and keeps asking him to leave when students start being attacked by a supernatural, unknown foe. All this seems to be connected to the Chamber of Secrets, but that isn't of much help, especially considering the new Defense against the Dark Arts teacher, famous writer Gilderoy Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh), is a complete idiot.Darker and faster, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets repeats the Philosopher's Stone's mistake of being slightly too faithful to the literary source, but Columbus manages to compensate this flaw with better visuals, some really creepy set-ups and improved acting from the younger cast members (Emma Watson in particular). He has also made interesting choices when it comes to the new faces in the adult group: Branagh is very, very funny as the ego-fueled Lockhart (a role originally intended for Hugh Grant), but the most interesting addition is Jason Isaacs (whom I can't wait to see again in the fourth film) as Lucius Malfoy, an intriguingly sinister wizard who is as racist and arrogant as his son, Harry's arch-nemesis Draco. As for Dobby, a CG creature voiced by Toby Jones, he is interesting at first but rapidly becomes annoying, his masochistic antics being repetitive and a little dull.Finally, a special mention for Chamber's best element: Richard Harris, who sadly passed away a few weeks before the movie's premiere. He was, and is, incredibly good as headmaster Dumbledore and despite a worthy replacement (Michael Gambon), in the purists' hearts he will always be the one and only greatest wizard of all time.Verdict: good, but they could have done better. Thankfully, they did with number three...",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
More Uninspired Magic from Chris Columbus,"""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" is more of the same from Chris Columbus, the man who brought the first Harry Potter book to film: dutifully committed to pleasing fans of the book resulting in completely uninspired filmmaking.Though if Columbus had to direct any of the Potter films, I'm glad he was assigned the first two, before the series turned dark. Columbus's style fits the bubble-gum kiddie movie tone of the first two books, but would have been completely mismatched with the later installments.The fun of all the Harry Potter movies lies in seeing what big-time British talent will pop up as the various adult characters, and in this one it's Kenneth Branagh as the preening Gilderoy Lockhart who gets most of the fun.Grade: B",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"has its moments, but by far the least memorable of the films so far","Maybe it was keeping on Chris Columbus as director- he helmed the first Harry Potter and did an OK, if not that terrific, job at it- or in making it about as long as possible (whether or not everything in the book, as someone who's seen the films but not read the books, I can't say, though it feels like they crammed it all), or in making it a wee bit too corny, but Chamber of Secrets is a bulky kids movie. It has an appeal for the whole family, as does the first one, and it has some charm and excitement in its Quiddich battle scenes, but it isn't really always the sort of material that might stay with you long after it's over (unless, of course, you're a hardcore fan). It works at best in the form of the atypical sequel: same characters that like Potter just as much- his closest friends Ron and Hermonie- and those that don't like Snape and Malfoy.Although the film/story does set up ""he-who-mus-not-be-named"" in a good and ambiguous way, this is more in hindsight of the more recent Potter stories, where that is made much more clear and sinister. It does have some rousing bits in there, as I recall, John Cleese is particularly good as Nearly Headless Nick (basically plopping a Monty Python performer in the midst of it all, which is the case) and there's always Richard Harris as Dumbledore (I still prefer him over Gambon, even though the latter is still good). But a lot of it seems much too clichÃ©, even coming from the decent lot of Rowling subversions, and the whole bits with the character Dobby is just really cheesy. In short, it's the only one of the Potter movies I don't have a desire to see too soon, and if I ever do read the books I only anticipate it can only go up from here in quality.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
I absolutely LOVED this movie,"This movie is way better than the first one, which everyone is saying because--let's face it--it's true. The three leads have grown into their characters, and their acting is loads better. I kept thinking during the first one, ""Aw, look at these cute little kids playing Harry, Ron and Hermione."" Now they ARE Harry, Ron and Hermione, though they still won't get any Oscar nods. All the new characters were absolutely wonderful. I was not disappointed at all with a single one, even Dobby. Now, I know a lot of people compare him to another CGI character, but he's not like that at all. I loved Dobby, even though when I saw him the trailers I thought I was going to hate him. Jason Isaacs as Malfoy was an absolute slime ball, and just so deliciously evil. Not bad looking, either, especially with his luscious long blonde hair. Bonnie Wright returned as Ginny Weasley, who had a much more important part and did an excellent job, I was very impressed. I'm tempted to go on about the lovely Christian Coulson as Tom Riddle, and Kenneth Branaugh, who embodies Gilderoy Lockhart on the screen, but this review has a word limit. Even if you are not a massive Harry Potter fan, you will find this movie very enjoyable. It's scary (spiders, snakes, and willows, oh my!) and incredibly funny, thanks to Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) and of course Kenneth Branaugh, the incredibly pompous new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Back to the subject of the three leads, Daniel Radcliffe (Harry), Rupert Grint (Ron), and Emma Watson (Hermione). They have grown quite a bit since the last film, though it's not a bad thing-Harry and his friends are supposed to grow too. Girls are starting to notice how good-looking Harry has become, and Ron, who is still adorable, and Hermione is becoming very pretty. I was pleased to see that her appearance was more like it was described in the books-she even had big teeth. Ron is finally taller than the other two like he's supposed to be, but that's most likely due to Rupert being older. I only had one disappointment as a major Potter fan-Sean Biggerstaff. While I believe he is absolutely dreamy and am in love with him, he just didn't come across as the mad, maniacal Wood we've grown to love. A consolation for some of the die-hard fans who might find the movie a little fast when they first see it-see it twice. The second time is so much more enjoyable, I can't tell you why, but you'll love it. I'd recommend this movie to anyone, from the scary gothic kid who sits next to me in fourth period to my work-a-holic father, it's great. I can't wait to see it again with my mother, who was away this weekend. I've already seen it twice, and it's only been out for three days. I can guarantee that you'll enjoy it, even if you didn't like the first one-which I personally find odd, but slightly understandable. Slightly. Go see Chamber of Secrets!",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Good Film!,"I only watched this film last night, and i found it throughly enjoyable! Definitely a must-see film, and much better than the first. It was a lot funnier, not to mention scarier! As expected, there were a few let downs when some of the funniest or important scenes were left out. However, you have to realize not everything that sounds brilliant in the book can be just as good on the screen. Never-the-less.....i strongly recommend it!!!!

Child-friendly but definitely not childish!,"Nearly 8 years and 6 films later, this was only my very first acquaintance with the Harry Potter franchise. I obnoxiously considered myself not to be a part of the target audience (too old and anti-computer generated effects), even though the copious fantasy & horror ingredients always somewhat triggered my curiosity. I literally waited until this second installment in the series was programmed on national television and I was too lazy to switch the channel. It didn't take too long before I regretted having waited this long, as ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" is a vastly entertaining and impressively accomplished blockbuster. Obviously I can't compare it to anything else, as I haven't seen any of the other films and never even held one of J.K. Rowling's books in my hands, but you don't need comparison in order to know this is excellent fun to enjoy with a big pack of popcorn. According to most reviewing people around here, this second film is already a lot darker and more sinister than ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" and apparently the series gradually grew more mature. Me, I was already quite astounded with the amount and types of morbidity featuring in this. ""The Chamber of Secrets"" is child-friendly, but definitely not childish. Of course there aren't any explicit death sequences shown on screen, but there's loads of creepy stuff (giant spiders, snake-monsters, spontaneously combusting birds, Â) that I imagine can be quite nightmarish.Following a successful rescue operation executed by his gingered best friend Weasley, Harry Potter escapes from his insufferable distant relatives and heads back for Hogwarts to attend his second year of wizardry. Even during the journey already and especially upon their arrival, it becomes obvious there's something strange going on. Perhaps Dobby, the overly humble and nervous little elf who came to warn Harry about not returning to school, was right. The rumors about the Chamber of Secrets reopening itself are getting louder and louder. This never before found chamber allegedly homes a hideous monster that destroys all the students whose blood isn't 100% pure wizard blood. Yeah okay, the plot is *slightly* more convoluted that this, but obviously I can't summarize 161 minutes of film and 360 pages of book in just a couple of sentences. The important thing to know is that ""Chamber of Secrets"" is a spectacularly fast-paced and non-stop adventurous film full of visual gimmicks and widely versatile fantasy elements. The cast choices are excellent. The child actors do terrific jobs and particularly the teachers at Hogwarts are stupendously cast. Richard Harris (who passed away before the theatrical release), Maggie Smith and Robbie Coltrane are great as the 'Good Samaritan' teachers, but my preference obviously goes out to the more malignant and eccentric characters. Alan Rickman as the uncanny Professor Snape and especially Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy provide an additional eerie atmosphere with their presence and Kenneth Branagh shines as the hoax magician and wannabe media superstar Gilderoy Lockhart.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Slowly But Surely The Details Unravel,"The first Harry Potter film, ""Sorcerer's Stone"", set the groundwork for the wizarding universe and the Potter characters. This second film, ""Chamber of Secrets"", slowly continues to unravel the narrative (with a lot of hi-jinx thrown in as well).For a basic plot summary, ""Chamber of Secrets"" begins with Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) being warned by Dobby (a house elf) not to return to Hogwarts for his second year. Not heeding the warnings, Harry does indeed return to his wizarding school and reunites with friends Hermoine (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint). Not long into the year, however, Harry and co. discover that a secret chamber does indeed exist in the bowels of Hogwarts, housing a monster hungry for the non-wizard blood of the young Hogwart-ians.The positives of this movie are that (with a few exceptions) it remains very faithful to the novel. It also is still a visual treat and contains some interesting special effects. The entire first half of the film contains a lot of what I would call ""hi-jinx"" (or adventurous material), which lends itself to a lot of fantastic visuals based on the crazy characters imagined in the novel.Another interesting little track to follow in these films is that the main actors continue to improve on their performances as they age. Radcliffe, Watson, & Grint were all quite young when the series began, so to see them mature as actors on the big screen is a treat. Of course, the auxiliary cast is tremendous again, with Kenneth Branagh (as Professor Lockhart) particularly engaging.The only reason I give this film four stars compared to the original's five is that I'm still waiting for the narrative to shift into high gear. I'm probably not being all that objective here. but the primary plots so far have been very conducive to the age of the main protagonists. As the characters age, however, I have been told that the stories mature a bit and really begin to take off.Do not be alarmed, however, as this is still a great, entertaining film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Not the target of this movie...but still enjoyable.,"Not being a fan of the Harry Potter Movies, I toddled along to the first showing of this movie at my local UGC Cinema and sat down and thirly enjoyed this movie, but not in the way that I would enjoy something like the Lord of The Rings or Spider-Man. Of course Harry Potter's target audience is of a younger age so I can see how I might not have enjoyed it as much as a slightly younger audience, but to say the least it is a lot better than some of the crap that is fizzled out these days.Crap this is not and a year on the main characters are a lot older, taller and voices broken. Many of the original cast return and a few new characters appear in this such as Kenneth Branagh and Jason Isaacs. Kenneth Branagh plays a wonderful part of Gilderoy Lockhart who seems to think he's adored by all and quite frankly he is adored by women for his charm and bravery. He was one of the better bits in the movie as was Jason Isaacs who played Lucius Malfoy father of Draco.  Jason sports a nice long wig and plays the evil father/villian down to a T.  He plays it much like his villian in The Patriot. I was sometimes phased by Rupert Grint's ""Ron"". He isn't that great an actor, but he could play his part satisfactory. He could have done better, but then again I have not read the book so I would not know how Ron would have behaved. I guess the scenes he played a scary person (which was quite a lot) in weren't convincing enough for me, but kids should get a good laugh out of him more than I did. I suppose you can't hold it against the kids who aren't up to par because they're just young and learning the actors trade, but for those who play their part well they should get a pat in the back.The SFX were impressive, especally the character of Dobby. He was well great. I couldnt tell he was CG by his bad creation, but through the fact there was no way they could have done it otherwise. In fact the CG character of Dobby is very similar looking to Gollum in Lord of The Rings and the CG Asgard in television series Stargate SG-1 (speaking of textures) which which speaks well for Stargate SG-1 if it can do just as good as a top movie like this...and top it is. The CG Spiders were incredibly creepy and realistic looking. Not being too scared of Spiders, they kind of made me jump. I felt by body tense up as the gave case to Harry and Ron, which is a good thing because not often do I find myself doing this in movies. The person I had sat beside seemed pretty scared of the spiders as well.John Williams score was very much like his original score with old themes returning and some of the music sounding like music from his Indiana Jones scores. I found myself whistling the main theme of Harry Potter for most of the night and on occasion not realizing I was doing it until someone else pointed it out to me.This movie certainly had better action sequences and a lot more action geared than The 1st Potter movie. I found myself clenching up at points as they were really tense. The story wasn't too difficult to understand from a non-potter-fan point of view and the film was a lot shorter than I expected. I had thought it ran for three hours when it was more like 2 1/2. In some cases I found that you had to have seen the 1st movie to understand some of what was going on, but that was mainly due to the back story of he who shall not be uttered and some of the gags. The only thing that annoyed me was that the cues in the Foyer were too long and I couldnt get an ice cream and there was some little toddler crying down the front row for a few minutes mid-way. Why bring a toddler who's going forget about the film by next week? You may ask this yourself.If you're not a mad-potter-fan then I would suggest you wait a few weeks so that you're not over run with humans who stand 4 feet tall...ie. CHILDREN! (I'm not talking about Dwarves)I'd give it 8.5/10. But I am not a huge fan of these movies and I am not the target audience.  That's a good thing in case you were wondering.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"OK, but not great","The first Harry Potter was interesting, and good fun. Much of this was due to the novelty of it all. The first Harry Potter introduced us to the characters and concepts of the series.This, the second, uses that template and provides another plot. The plot is fairly mundane and overwrought. At nearly three hours it is ridiculously long for a linear plot-driven kid's adventure story.This is all said, there is a momentum that keeps it going. There are some new concepts and characters. All this is enough to make it marginally likable (hence the 3/5).High points for me are the acting of Kenneth Branagh and Alan Rickman, and their characters' rivalry.The worry is that if the Harry Potter series has run out of steam this much since the first movie, what will the eighth movie be like?",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Entertaining, And Ranks Somewhere In The Middle Of The HP Films","I thought this was better than the first Harry Potter movie because it didn't overdo the action scenes as the first film did, and the special-effects were better. It's not ""Lord Of The Rings,"" of course, but it's still decent entertainment, even for us older folks. It got even better with the third installment, which has been my personal favorite of the four I've seen now.I don't buy into all the occult baloney and black magic stuff, just enjoying the special-effects that go with it with these stories. It also was interesting to see how the three young stars - Daniel Radcliff (""Harry""), Emma Watson (""Hermione"") and Rupert Grint (""Ron"") have physically matured since the first movie. All of a sudden, the boys have reached puberty and their voices are changing. ""Ron"" squeaks half the time he talks!As with many modern-day, big-budget films, the visuals, the special-effects and the surround sound are all astounding. Definitely entertaining for all ages with no worries about language.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Quite boring!,"One might imagine that because Chris Columbus pulled off a faithful, yet exciting, movie adaptation of the first Harry Potter adventure that he would be able to it a second time. I'm sorry to report that he definitely has not.There are so many things wrong with this film and almost nothing to recommend it. More than two-and-a-half hours are spent rolling around in pure tedium - only the REALLY easily pleased will be entertained. The story has a slightly harder tone than the first, but there is nothing on display that will discomfort anyone of any age.Harry is being mentally tortured and starved by his muggle family during the summer holidays. He longs to go back to Hogwarts, but a Jar-Jar Binks lookalike elf, called Dobby, turns up in his bedroom and warns him that terrible things await him there. It's six of one and half a dozen of the other for Harry, as the Dursleys can be just as evil as anything the chamber of secrets has to offer.Once Harry gets to school - by means of a flying Ford Anglia - his fellow pupils are frozen with fear at the slightest glimpse of something evil. Harry hears voices in the walls that no one else can. And he suffers from the incompetence of the new Defence Against The Black Arts teacher, Gilderoy Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh, totally miscast), who is not as funny as in the book.Five minutes after we are re-introduced to the students and teachers, the film slips into a clumsy mishmash of poorly staged scenes and bad acting. First time around it was easy to turn a blind eye to the amateurism of these kids. But there's no excusing it now. They've had a year to study their performances and see what was right and wrong - I know, I know, they're only kids. Trust me, none of them will be thanking the Academy anytime soon, which makes most of their scenes difficult to watch. Even with the support of such talent as Richard Harris, Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith - Robbie Coltrane is seriously underused - they cannot handle the weight of the material. Their acting seems a few seconds behind the adults and any scene with them together has big contrasts between veteran and novice.Steven Kloves' screenplay tears out many pages and cuts so many corners from J.K. Rowling's book - once again, Rik Mayall is completely left out - in order to keep a tight pace. Yet the film still manages to be dull and boring. Nothing REALLY happens. And there are far too many pauses and silences in dialogue scenes - an absolute crime in a film of this length. With the exception of the chamber of secrets - which holds precious few secrets, I might add - no part of Hogwarts is explored. Almost the entire movie is shot in a generic corridor and you can bet your bottom dollar that for the other locations Columbus just shot the same set from a different angle. The lighting is conveniently yellow-candlelit, when he wants it to be mysterious, or comfortable, and green, or blue, when it should be menacing.Some credit should be given to the director for trying to make it a little bit darker than before. There's nothing visually disturbing, but the sight of a petrified Hermione and the angles he uses for the film's many and lengthy dialogue scenes echo film noir rather than tame, family friendly blockbuster.Aside from one quidditch match and the final showdown, there is nothing of interest. The mystery is very weak and straight-forward. There is too much talk and not enough action. It doesn't bode well for the rest of the series, which has so far been equally as dull.All the best elements that made the original entertaining are not here. Hagrid has less than five minutes screen time and Columbus exploits our disappointment by giving him a big applause at the end. This did not happen in the book and he only does it because that's his style, to force the audience to cry (Home Alone, Bicentennial Man).",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A great sequel!,"If you liked the first one then you're going to love this!  There's a darker atmosphere this time around and more characters are introduced including Gilderoy Lockhart (hilariously played by Kenneth Branagh), Draco Malfoy's father, Lucius (a great performance by Jason Isaacs, exactly how I imagined the character from the books!), Ron's father, Arthur, and the mysterious Dobby the house elf (fortunately he isn't anywhere near as annoying as other CG characters in other movies, but I won't name any names... *cough*JarJarBinks*cough*)The movie sticks closely to the novel, but as in the last movie we miss some of those scenes where we start to learn a little more about the characters, especially the hate-hate relationship between Harry and Professor Snape (who was seriously underused in this movie!)All in all it's definitely worth checking out, the running time of 160 minutes may seem a little long but it doesn't seem that long when you're watching it.  By the way, whatever you do DO NOT leave until the credits have ended, otherwise you'll miss a little extra treat...",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Zooms Along,"Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets is the type of movie that will be around forever. So far the two Harry Potter movies have been excellent movies in which spirit of the books by JK Rowling has been captured and expanded upon.Chamber of Secrets is about Harry Potter's (Daniel Radcliffe) second year in Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry and something is attacking the students. The fact that these students are of mixed parentage, one being a muggle(non-magical and the other being a witch or wizard) leads to a very unstable environment at Hogwarts.Directed by Chris Columbus and written by Steve Kloves this movie packed with the details that Rowling weaves throughout her book. The score by John Williams is excellent and well suited to the movie. Roger Pratt's cinematography is amazing. There is flashback to an earlier time at Hogwarts by way of a magical Diary that is brilliantly lit and shot in a sepia tone that looks just like the color of old paper.Kenneth Branagh gives a great performance that should have gotten more attention at award time. Jason Isaacs owns the role of the villainous Lucius Malfoy. His costuming and look are very well matched with that of Draco Malfoy, a nemesis of Harry's. Shirley Henderson as a ghost is also very good and steals her scenes. Returnees Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, and in particular the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore are very good. Christian Coulson does a good job as the  mysterious Tom Riddle.Daniel Radcliffe Emma Watson (Hermione) and Rupert Grint (Ron) are very good in this movie and have their characters down. Watson in particular is excellent.Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets in an underrated movie that is a must see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Stop knocking this masterpiece,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is superb, and don't listen to those narrow-minded critics who claim otherwise. Those who said it is superior to the first film are right: Philosopher's Stone was wonderful but the sequel does for Harry Potter what the Empire Strikes Back did for Star Wars - elevate it to a higher level where it will be regarded as a masterpiece in it's own right.The plot is tighter and 'cleaner' then the first film, and runs along at a pace brisk enough to sweep the two-hours away with the wave of a wand. The acting from Daniel Radcliffe was criticised by some in the first film and still others are bleating on about him now. Give it a rest, say I. He was excellent.Hogwarts itself really comes to life, largely due to the camera shots sweeping in through a window or over the castle - it feels a lot more 'rounded' and the Quidditch match benefits from a makeover and improved SFX.Unlike some other fantasy films the CGI is not over used and doesn't smother the screen.If you've read other reviews you'll know Kenneth Branagh is wonderful as Lockhart (and you have to stay to the end credits to see what happens to him)Jason Isaacs is great as Lucius Malfoy, and overall the film is scarier and darker then the first film, and there is a very touching moment involving Hermione and Ron which was performed with wonderful understatement by Rupert and Emma.Throughout the whole 2 hours I don't think I stopped smiling. The Whomping Willow, the flying car, the duel between Draco and Harry - every scene was a joy to behold.To those critics who keep on comparing Potter to Lord of the Rings and finding the former wanting (one person even laughingly suggested Christopher Columbus was ripping it off)bear in mind that Philospher's Stone is the second biggest film of all time behind Titanic - beating Rings. I use this only to illustrate the popularity and success of Harry Potter, as so many people seem to find it inferior. I for one was left cold by Rings and was thoroughly bored by it - it was the least magical fantasy film I had ever seen. Give me Harry Potter any day.Anyone who rates this film poorly (comparing it to Rings no doubt as they always do) has no sense of adventure, no sense of humour, and -most importantly - no sense of wonder.So put that in your cauldron and boil it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Underwhelming,"I was underwhelmed. I haven't read the books and I knew nothing going in, except the first movie.This movie is all plot. There isn't one iota of character development at all. we learn nothing new about any of these character's motivations beyond what we already knew from the first film. Characters come and go, and disappear for long stretches as the plot dictates.Many scenes are well done but ultimately pointless and should have been cut to bring the film down to a more bearable running time. In particular, the entire opening sequence of Harry at home. it's Harry Potter 1 reduxe.The spider scene was quite well done and creepy but also extreneous.  It's a long scene with a deus ex machia resolution that really doesn't tell Harry anything.Of the 2 scenes of students in class, the one with winged gremlins also serves no function but it was in the book so they included it.The Quiddich match was very well done and exciting. Had the feel of the speeder bike chase from Return of the Jedi. Probably the best part of the film.Even more so than the first one, this film had the feel of plot gears grinding away, each scene happening because the book dictated it that way. As the first one, it lacked any magic or spontinaity. It feels ""programmed"" and ultimately lifeless, a visualization of the book, not a film on it's own.I wanted to be wow'ed. I wasn't.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A Bit Darker but No Less Entertaining Than Its Predecessor,"This film essentially begins where its predecessor ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" left off with ""Harry Potter"" (Daniel Radcliffe) leaving the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for the summer. Naturally, since his only living relatives weren't very nice to him previously he dreads the thought of spending staying with them. Sure enough, they waste little time in making his life miserable and doing everything they can to prevent him from conversing with his friends or going back to Hogwarts. Then one day he gets a visit from a goblin named ""Dobby"" (voice supplied by Toby Jones) who also does everything he can to prevent him from going back as well-and the reason is more sinister than either of them realize. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I thought this sequel was just as good as the movie before it due in large part to the darker and more intriguing plot. However, like the first film, it does run a bit long (161 minutes) so that might be one consideration for those wishing to watch it. Even so, it was still quite enjoyable and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
*A Magical Tapestry of Mystery and Friendship*,"""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" is more than just a sequel; it is an intricate tapestry woven with threads of mystery, friendship, and the timeless fight between good and evil. From the moment the screen lights up, we are plunged back into the enchanting world of Hogwarts, where every corner holds secrets waiting to be uncovered.*The film masterfully deepens our understanding of the wizarding world, introducing us to the darker undertones that lie beneath the cheerful faÃ§ade of Hogwarts. This time, Harry faces not just the challenges of growing up but also a sinister force that threatens his very existence. The suspense builds with every scene, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats. Whether it's the eerie whispers echoing through the castle or the chilling legends surrounding the Chamber itself, the film crafts an atmosphere of palpable tension that is impossible to ignore.The performances are nothing short of magical. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint shine brighter than ever, their characters becoming more complex and relatable. We witness Harry's struggle not only with the dangers of the Chamber but also with the weight of his growing identity and legacy. The introduction of Dobby, voiced with endearing earnestness, adds a unique charm to the narrative and showcases themes of freedom and loyalty that resonate deeply.Visually stunning, the film's aesthetic honors its source material while also elevating it through remarkable special effects. The climactic scenes in the Chamber are unforgettable, a thrilling blend of artistry and CGI that captures the imagination. The script, penned by Steve Kloves, retains the wit and humor of J. K. Rowling's original work while effectively advancing character arcs and plot intricacies.""The Chamber of Secrets"" emphasizes the importance of friendship and courage in the face of adversity. As Harry, Ron, and Hermione encounter the perils of growing up, they also learn invaluable lessons about trust, bravery, and the significance of standing together against the odds.""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" is a quintessential continuation of Harry's journey, filled with enchanting storytelling, profound themes, and unforgettable characters. It is a film that not only captivates the imagination of its viewers but also invites them to reflect on the power of friendship and the courage to face one's fears. This movie is a must-watch for anyone seeking to lose themselves in a world of wonder and magic, proving once again that the adventure has only just begun.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Improves on the first one in every way.,"With a better story, this film easily surpasses the first. The film is entertaining all the way through, and never seems to slow down. New characters are introduced, and the old characters are more fleshed out in this movie. I would definitely recommend this film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
eye candy is not enough,"I hated this movie. I'm sorry if that bothers anyone, but that is my opinion. No, I have not read any of the books, nor will I ever, but that should have no bearing on the quality of the movie; in other words, if I have to like the book to like the movie, then this is simply a movie for fans, nothing more.The movie was extremely slow, the plot incredibly predictable, and, overall, the main problem with the movie was its emphasis on visuals... well, that and the fact that all of the peripheral material that was pretty much left in for showmanship could have been cut out completely and wouldn't have been missed (I will not mention such scenes here since I don't want to spoil anything)... but I am a firm believer that before you can have a good movie, you MUST have a good script.This movie did not. And I think Chris Columbus realized this as he was directing it... the characters talk the whole time about the plot, explaining what's happened as if we missed it, and seem to have little thoughts of their own... so, rather than leave his camera still, which would have been even more unbearable, he places as much emphasis on showing things as he possibly can, to the point that the script is pretty much useless. What's the point to all of the out-of-place tilts or all of the effects shots? Nothing really, other than to keep interest. Yes, I realize film is a visual medium, but there's a difference between using visuals to add to the story and using visuals for the sake of using them because they're the only thing worth while... this film falls into the latter of the two (admitted, the effects are good for the most part, but when the effects are the best part of a movie, it's not a very good movie).Anyway, I'm sure my criticisms will only be criticized and cut down, or possibly thrown away as being worthless, but this is my opinion nonetheless - just because some of you may agree or disagree does not necessarily make any of us right.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Nightmarish intrigues at the magical dream school,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets isn't only the best novel of the franchise but also the best movie along with the first entry Harry Potter and the Philospher's Stone. The story revolves around a mysterious dangerous presence at Hogwarts that paralyzes innocent witnesses and attempts to open a legendary room that hides a terrifying secret.This sequel convinces on all levels. The story is even gloomier than the first one and grabs the viewers' attention from start to finish. The special effects are particularly outstanding and have aged very well. Especially the epic finale in the chamber of secrets is particularly memorable. The young actresses and actors are once again doing excellent jobs and especially the friendship between Harry Potter, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley becomes more credible, emotional and strong. The movie also introduces a few new characters that are very fascinating such as a young Ginny Weasley who is having a particularly traumatizing first year at Hogwarts and Gilderoy Lockhart who can be seen as a parody of contemporary starts and starlets with his self-centered arrogance based upon exaggerations and lies. Another important element is that the movie is very close to the novel and introduces the viewers once again to different classes and teachers at Hogwarts. This movie truly shows why so many kids and teenagers wish their schools were a little bit like Hogwarts.Despite a seemingly challenging length of two hours and forty-one minutes, every single scene is relevant, imaginative and entertaining. Kids as well as teenagers and adults should feel particularly fascinated by this creative movie for the whole family with a few gloomy, mature and profound twists. This movie has aged particularly well and it has to be stated once again that the first two movies in the franchise are also by far the best thanks to excellent scriptwriters, gifted designers and a veteran director who knows how to create magical movies that stand the test of time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"A superb contination with improved child acting and special effects, Chamber of Secrets is a mystery worth exploring","(I would like to dedicate this review to the late actors Robbie Coltrane and Leslie Phillips who played Hagrid and the Sorting Hat. Those gentlemen were very talented by bringing so much timeless magic to their roles and will never be forgotten. After all, there's no Hogwarts without them. R. I. P.)That being said, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is not only a good adaptation of the second book, but it's a great sequel. The child acting is an improvement, the special effects are even greater, the cinematography is as stunning as ever, the supporting actors are still great with the late Richard Harris still shining as Dumbledore and Jason Isaac as a welcome addition as Lucius Malfoy, Draco's father. The story is well written as it expands more on the Wizarding world while also bring a sense of mystery when it comes to Tom Riddle. Not to mention the darker tone is well handled while still retaining some good comedy.If there is one quibble I do have with the film is that it did feel somewhat too overlong when compared to the Sorcerer's Stone's minute length, but that doesn't hurt the movie in any way, though.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is one of the best entries of the franchise and still holds up after 20 years.

Better than the first Harry Potter.,"I'm not a huge Harry Potter fan, but I really did enjoy 'the chamber of secrets'.  After seeing the first installment of the Harry Potter saga I wasn't quite sure what to make of it all.  I never hated it, nor loved it, but I can honestly say that it hadn't left any impression on me.However, this second installment was a vast improvement on the first.  The movie moves a lot quicker & goes straight into the story without any faffing about.  I guess there's little need for introductions as we already know of most of the main characters.The kids' acting appears to have improved a hell of a lot.  Looks like they've gained more confidence, and it really shows, which is great for us as they're much more entertaining to watch now.The ending to this movie was also a great improvement from the last film, with a more believable baddie and more terrifying monsters.All in all, I was impressed with this film, more so when I compare to the first one.  Others may disagree.  I don't care!  This is a kids film, after all.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
My second Harry Potter-saga favorite movie,"Here's round two of the adventures of young wizard Harry Potter and friends. While not a terrible movie, this one is probably my least favorite and the most forgettable. It's more faithful than the previous film, but that's not entirely a good thing, as this one really drags, and, at this point, it's not quite necessary yet since the books didn't start getting really detailed, ambitious, and overblown until part 4. Columbus returns as director, and this time we follow 12 year-old Harry going through his second year of schooling. As if rival students, menacing teachers, and loads of schoolwork weren't enough, things start getting dire at school when people are found petrified like statues, threats are written on walls in blood, and a monster is on the loose. Even a gifted wizard like Harry may have some serious trouble coping. I can appreciate that they were trying to be more faithful to the book, but they might have been too faithful. It's my least favorite entry, and, while it's not boring, it's just not gripping enough, I feel, to warrant a film of such length. At least the film is good about balancing the tone fairly well. All the actors are fine, and they are only getting better and more comfortable with the characters with each new entry. Harris made his swan song here as Dumbledore, but his replacement in part 3 takes up the mantle with ease. All in all, a decent movie, but like I said, probably my least favorite.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Can you say Wonderful??,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was a wonderful movie, just as good as the first. The acting I have to say was much better. Some parts were left out but it followed the book way more than the first one did. The actors that were choosen for this movie worked very well and Kenneth Branagh did a wonderful job as Gilderoy Lockhart. The only problem I had with it is that it was a little slow. It took awhile for somethings to get moving but that is alright. Everything just worked very well and the music was wonderful, just as good as the first. Over all I would give this movie an A+++ and for those who didn't like it (I don't tell people how to controll their opinions but...) your crazy. No it's ok not everyone has to like it.

Very good but exhausting,"Who would have thought it?  Director Chris Columbus has actually made a very good film!This film follows Harry Potter in his second year at Hogwarts with a much darker tone than the first film.  However, the film should be dark--the books are.  This film is much better than the first.  The first had to spend a lot of time introducing Harry, his friends and Hogwarts.  This film assumes you know all about it and kicks right in.  It moves quickly and has better (and more) special effects.  Little time is spent on characters and motivations--whether that's good or bad depends on what you like.The acting has improved.  Daniel Radcliffes (Harry Potter) voice has noticably deepened and his acting has improved (a little).  Emma Watson (Hermione) has blossomed into a very pretty young girl and gives a very good performance.  Rupert Grint (Ron) is just OK--he's got to stop being so bug-eyed over everything.  Also Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman and the (sadly) late Richard Harris offer strong support.  The only bad piece of casting was Kenneth Branaugh as a new teacher.  He's supposed to be funny yet sinister--he's neither--just boring and silly.The film is NOT for small children.  As I said before, it's dark and has some very scary moments (all of them involving giant, hungry spiders and vicious, huge snakes).  Also there's some fairly bloody violence (for a PG-13).The main problem is the films length--2 hours, 41 minutes.  It's long and there's a lot of action and story covered.  I was exhausted by the end of the movie (in a good way).So, it's a great roller coaster ride for older children and adults.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
6.8/10,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a nice follow-up to the first film, improving on several aspects but still not the greatest in the series. I rated it 7/10 because, while it's definitely enjoyable, it doesn't quite reach the heights of later installments. The plot here is compelling, particularly the mystery surrounding Tom Riddle and the secrets tied to the Chamber of Secrets itself. The uncovering of the lore, the hidden messages, and the gradual unraveling of the mystery kept me hooked. However, the actual moments inside the Chamber didn't quite live up to the tension built throughout the rest of the film. They felt a bit less exciting than I'd hoped, especially after all the build-up. That said, the nostalgic appeal of the movie adds to its charm, reminding us of what makes the wizarding world so enchanting. Some parts do feel a bit superficial, which makes sense given the film's focus on a younger audience, but as the series progresses, the magical elements and the handling of the world become far more refined. In comparison to later films, this one feels more aimed at children, which can be a bit off-putting for older viewers, but it's still enjoyable. The films mature as the series progresses, and in that context, this movie is solid, especially considering it's only the second one.All in all, while The Chamber of Secrets might not be the best in the series, it's a definite improvement over the first film and sets the stage for what's to come. It's a good film, but one of the lesser entries, especially for those who are beyond its target demographic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Let's Make It Up As We Go Along,"I ignored the hype of the Potter books and also the movies until now. In China I can buy them at just over a dollar so I got the all except the most recent one. I thought I would see what this world was about. How disappointing! Clearly the author, Rowling I think her name is, was just making stuff up as she went. She had not thought through the complete storyline. New things just keep on popping up with no real foundation in storytelling. Also new actors take turns in appearing for no other reason than to grandstand. This movie had Kenneth B and he was a complete misfit.I was also annoyed by the frequent awe accorded Harry Potter all with no reason I could see. In summing up the first and part of the second movie I could see no reason that he was a master wizard. He did not know spells or incantations. He was easily cowed. He appeared lost and befuddled on many occasions.Please don't start me on the family he was living with. Such cardboard figures that he lived with. They were all one-dimensional, not real characters at all.I really enjoyed the Lord of the Rings books and movies. they were written to be appreciated by both adults and children, and they stay with you. These Harry Potter movies, at least so far, seem to be meant for seven-year-old's. There just isn't any adult material in them. I notice I have used the speed-up key many times already in the second movie to bypass obvious parts.I can't stress enough how the appearance of everything being made up as the story progresses strikes me. The Lord of the Rings was carefully thought out while this seems to be off the cuff, with new ways to do old things always appearing out of thin air.I give this move a 3 because of the emptiness of the subject matter, and for making a movie without continuity.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"OK, I just finished The Chamber of Secrets, whoo! That was a long movie! But I can understand, these are long books, these movies have a lot to fit into. But I have to say that actually I think I enjoyed Chamber of Secrets a little more than The Sorcerer's Stone. It had more humor and a lot more chilling action sequences. The Chamber of Secrets is a great continue of the sequels to come I'm sure. I loved the new characters, Professor Gilderoy Lockhart was my favorite, but I'm a huge fan of Kenneth's, so I think I just am a soft touch for him.Harry is about to start a new year at Hogwarts, looking forward to seeing his friends again, Ron and Hermione, getting back into the spells. But he is warned by Dobby, a house elf that there is danger ahead. As it turns out he's right, there is a creature that is after the ""mudbloods"", wizards who were not born from magic, had normal parents. Also there is Tom Riddle who wants to make sure that his memory will live forever and Voldebolt's as well.The Chamber of Secrets was great for me. I thought it had great characters, great magical effects, and is brilliantly made. I have to say that I'm more impressed and am very glad I'm giving these movies a chance since we have like 12 more coming up, lol. Although the kid, Malfroy is a bit annoying, I'm looking forward to The Prisoner of Azkaban, it has an even better rating, so please IMDb users, don't let me down, I hope you're right.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
And the Series Continues...,"Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) ignores warnings not to return to Hogwarts, only to find the school plagued by a series of mysterious attacks and a strange voice haunting him.With Chris Columbus still directing, this film maintains much of the element of fun the first film had. The danger is upped a bit with the inclusion of some ""creature violence"" that may be scary for younger viewers. But, overall, these are still kids (12-year olds now). The best addition to this cast is the girl who plays Moaning Myrtle, whose name I unfortunately do not know.I find this one to be the least memorable of the first few films. While it has some important parts to it -- such as establishing the Malfoy family's dark connections and introducing Tom Riddle, Dobby and Moaning Myrtle -- the overall story is relatively uninteresting. Those who see the later films or have read the books will tell you that Ginny Weasley, who plays a prominent role here, will come back in a big way later, so it is important to make her a focus. And I agree, but they still only make casual references to her despite her centrality to the plot.One positive note about its being less than memorable is that the film has a healthy dose of mystery and suspense, and although I watched it a second time barely a year ago, I had already forgotten much of it by my third viewing. There was also much going on that I did not realize was important in the long run...",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Makes the first one feel like an appetizer...,"""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" was an already satisfying meal but ""The Chamber of Secrets"" make its feel like an appetizer... and what an appetizing premise its title carries.A second installment that is basically telling you in every frame ""wait a minute, you haven't seen nothing yet"" is the kind of offer any movie lover can't refuse. And on that level, let me enumerate a few things ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" have: the thrills of an Indiana Jones movie, the CGI expertise of a ""Star Wars"", the smooth pace of an Agatha Christie mystery, the whimsicality of a ""Disney"", the capability to immerse you into a whole universe like some blockbuster adapted from Tolkien, and yet... it is a straight continuation of the original film, in plot and spirit.And that's the mark of a great franchise: you have a first film that doesn't try to play it for the profits only and then the second that doesn't take the previous success for granted and gratifies the audience with denser and richer material. ""Chamber of Secrets"" might be a tad overloaded but things never go overboard thanks to Chris Columbus's alternation between action and mystery... and action is an understatement when you have a flying car, giant spiders and a confrontation with a giant snake that makes the first film's climax feel like a tea party.The mystery part is even more fascinating because it's all built on the first film's established elements: Hogwarts and its four founders, the evil Salazar Slytherin whose true intents were foreshadowed by Hagrid's statement that not all wizards turn out to be good and the fact that some students are Muggle-born like Hermione Granger. The original canvas stays the same but the scope gets bigger, as if the clear picture we had on Hogwarts in the first film turned out to be only the tip of an iceberg, a puzzle with many pieces missing and it's impossible to identify which. But this time, the stakes are high, and even innocent students can be killed... or in the best case, petrified. Yes, the material is pretty heavy.But I guess the choice to make the story darker and edgier was inevitable. In the span of one year only, many kids had their voices broken, they all grew up, Hermione's interactions with the boys get more awkward for obvious hormonal reasons, so they're all fit for more challenging experiences. And guess what? That's probably the secret of the franchise: the audience grew with the characters, which takes me back to my brother who showed me the first film, he was eight when it was released and entered university with the last one. We're talking of life-shaping series, like ""Star Wars"" but with more humanity.So yes, for a whole decade, the ""Harry Potter"" series defined the word 'Fantasy' and its maturation of tone was almost a natural process. Author J.K. Rowling knew she could go darker in the depiction of Hogwarts; just like a known place that reveals hidden corridors, passageways, chambers or even residents. Things that existed all along but whose absence in the first film could make sense, as these additions never seem contrived... neither do a few coincidental accidents. Magic can work in mysterious ways after all and what goes for locations goes for characters as well.So, in ""Chamber of Secrets"", we get a closer look on the Weasley family, we meet the little elf Dobie (Toby Wilson) who looks like a mix of Jar-Jar Binks, Gollum and E.T., a phoenix named Fawkes, Lucius Malefoy, the father of Harry's nemesis, played by Jason Isaacs who once again embodies the expression: ""if looks could kill"". We also meet the closest to a human comic relief as the vain and self-absorbed new teacher Lockhart, played by a hammy Kenneth Branagh and in Moaning Myrtle, the ghost of a young girl played so convincingly, I didn't recognize Shirley Henderson. These new characters are all promising but never given a full VIP treatment, their legitimacy always comes from their interactions with the regulars and I must say the eye stares between Harry and Malefoy were quite chilling.And the good all folks are there, Richard Harris, plays one last time his Albus Dumbledore before his sad passing in 2002, there's also Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane and Alan Rickman but this this time in rather static positions, as if the bizarre shenanigans happening within Hogwarts were scary even by their own standards... which is saying a lot. We suspect everything will be all right by the end yet the suspense is all there and the action too, served by convincing CGI-aided special effects. A few things didn't age quite well but I can imagine how impressive the film is for a theater audience, especially during the final act.Now, it's not indispensable to know the first film but don't expect much exposition: as soon as it starts, Harry knows the place he belongs to (remember his reluctance to go back home at the end of the first), he knows the extent of his power and his friendship with Ron and Hermione. He knows his place and he knows... well, he doesn't know everything and the film turns all his interrogations to plot-driving elements and interesting unveilings of backstories, secret identities, some good, some evil, not to mention those hints you only get after several viewings.Now, I probably missed a few things but I suspect I'll never know the series as much as I handle ""The Godfather"" or ""Back to the Future"" but you don't watch all movies the become an expert, do you?(On a side note, there is one shock during the film that proves that back in 2002, people didn't make a fuss about boys or girls being equally heroic. Not sure the plot point involving Hermione would have been used today. That's how ""old"" the film is)",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Fun ride,"Of course the Harry Potter books are out of this world. The movie has tried to reach the standards of the book, which is impossible to achieve I guess. Overall worth a watch, but I won't watch it again (while I've read the books a million times). Love Hermione! Just exemplary the way Voldemort appeared in this second part of the saga. I love how we slowly get a feel of his evilness, till the actual wizard regains power.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Fine prequel,"It is a contineuation af the Harry Potter franchise, not one og the best movies in that series, but a movie that needed to be a part of the story. To conclude still a nice Harry Potter story but less interesting plot. ð",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Snakes, Spiders and Moaning Myrtle.","Year two at Hogwarts for Harry Potter and his chums. When some pupils start to turn up in a petrified state, suspicion starts to fall on Harry himself, but along with his pals Hermione and Ron, he hopes to uncover the mystery of The Chamber Of Secrets.Chamber Of Secrets is my favourite Potter film, tho as an adult of some years, I do like the darker tone that the series would take after this instalment. But this remains my favourite because it is the one where the children are still just that, children. Harry and his buddies still have the innocence about them to fully realise the fantastical elements to J.K. Rowling's fabulous writing, witchcraft and wizardry has in short, never been so charming.Following on from the excellent character introduction of Philosopher's Stone, Chamber Of Secrets retains the whodunit heartbeat and ups the action and hilarity quotient, whilst simultaneously adding some scary flourishes into the bargain. Here we get a quite brilliant Quidittch match, and newer interesting characters entertain without diverting attention from the important children themselves, tho Kenneth Branagh's Gilderoy Lockhart joyously lights up the screen at frequent intervals. Chris Columbus directs again and quite clearly has honed some things from the first picture, the effects are a great improvement on Philosopher's Stone and Columbus here perfectly utilises the lush sweeping location to benefit the story.A touch too long at 160 minutes, Chamber Of Secrets never in fact outstays its welcome, and come the fabulous face off finale (Daniel Radcliffe as Harry very impressive) I personally feel well and truly rewarded for my time spent at Hogwarts for year two. 8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Enjoyable movie that works for children and adults,"In Harry's second year at Hogwarts, the mysterious chamber of secrets is opened and something starts attacking the students.This is an enjoyable Harry Potter movie with some strong moments, but feels a bit overlong at times.I found much entertainment in the characters and spectacle. Harry goes on several mini adventures within the story that are quite imaginative and show lots of wondrous sights of the wizarding world. As fun as this is, it slows down the plot and for me kills some of the intrigue associated with the central mystery.My only other gripe is that some moments are a little bit clichÃ©d, such as the repetitive situation in which Harry finds himself when first on the scene, looking guilty, as bad things happen. Likewise some of Lucius Malfoy's 'I'll get you next time' villain dialogue is a bit naff, even though Jason Issac delivers it fantastically well.It has some good character development for Harry and plenty of smaller but strong contributions from others, particularly non regulars like Professor Lockhart, Moaning Myrtle and Tom Riddle.For me one of the major strengths of the film is the supporting cast. Chris Columbus puts a host of British talent to great use. Each actor feels perfect for the role. My favourites are Alan Rickman, Kenneth Branagh, Julie Walters, and Issacs.I think the young stars are on par with most child actors in movies and television. Rupert Grint stands out as the most natural of the three but Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson have some slightly awkward moments. On the whole I think they deliver under what must have been a considerable weight of expectations in such a lucrative franchise. The best child performance in the movie though for me is Tom Felton who delivers all his lines with a confident amount of venom.As a children's movie it works fairly well as it mixes good natured adventures with scary sequences that are not too dark. Younger ones (under 7s) may be scared by some of the creature horror and some aspects of the plot may require explanation.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Deus Ex Macchina,"Deus Ex Macchina - or ""God in the machine"", a term used by the Greeks to describe an overly contrived script.This movie, along with its pathetic first movie is a great big joke.  The fact that so many people cannot see how bad the story line is, is testament to how low standards of story-telling have fallen.How pathetic it was for HP to suddenly and conveniently win the battle at the end of the first movie by touching someone's face - and the lame-o explanation given is ""it was a mother's love"" - WHAT?As if the weak ""Independence Day"" type ending of the first movie was not bad enough, the second one ends even worse - a stupid bird flies in at the last minute to destroy the big bad snake!  WHAT?  Independence Day - ""Secret Weapon"" all over again!Also - what a total ripoff Dobby was to Gollum.  For crying out loud, I think it was too much of a coincidence that a giant spider is in the second book of The Lord of the Rings - and surprise surprise, a giant spider in the second book of HP.  Gollum betrays his master, Dobby betrays his.  Both are similar looking, wearing tattered clothing - or for pete's sake.Oh how the standards have fallen.1/10 - and the 1 is for the special effects.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"You're bland, Harry...","The second in the Harry Potter franchise, 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' was clearly intended for small children. While this approach did work with 'The Philosopher's Stone' as the happy, Disney -esque atmosphere reflected Harry's idealism of a wizarding world that was perfect, a slightly moody and mature tone would have been far more suitable for CoS since this is when our Boy Who Lived starts to realise the darker side of being a wizard and being a hero. In this film, twelve-year-old Harry is now in his Second Year at Hogwarts when the school is subjected to mysterious attacks that leave Muggleborn students incapacitated. Harry, Ron and Hermione quickly learn a creature is stalking the school, a monster that lives in a secret chamber and was once responsible for the death of a child.The quality of the child acting still leaves much to desired, with Rupert Grint and Tom Felton shining out above their weaker contemporaries. It is left to the adult cast to provide the solid performances, which they do to a marvellous degree. Maggie Smith as McGonagall and Alan Rickman as Snape seem born to play their roles, bringing their characters to life in a way the child actors just can't do. Kenneth Branagh is a treat as the conceited, campy Lockhart and the scenes where he and Rickman's Snape play each other off are the best in the film. Jason Issacs also deserves a mention since he was deliciously evil as Lucius Malfoy. He and Tom Felton not only look like father and son but in a minute-long scene they were able to portray Draco's hero-worship of his father and Lucius' impatience with his son.The main problem with the film is that it has been produced in a very dull, bland manner. Instead of focusing on Harry's uncomfortable realisation that the wizarding world has problems and his shock at how quickly the school turn against him at the barest of evidence, scriptwriter Steve Kloves and director Chris Columbus seem intent on making the film a magical version of an Enid Blyton boarding school where kids merrily skip around solving problems. The vain attempts to make the film threatening, such as the overly-long flying car scene (as if anyone thought Harry was going to fall out) and the trudge through the Forbidden Forest, are flat and weak. The final battle between Harry and his unmasked enemy are also lacklustre with no spontaneity and drag on for too long. Character development hasn't improved much either with Ron continuing to be dumbed down for comic relief while we have Hermione getting Ron and Dumbledore's lines (and in the case of the latter, it just sounds odd hearing words of wisdom said by an powerful, elderly wizard in the book being uttered by a child of twelve in the film).CoS also drops a number of points, in my mind, for the crass, cheesy overly-sentimentality of the ending. Steve Kloves must have been in Hollywood saccharine mode when he thought that pupils in British high schools would honestly clap for teachers (especially ones who have done nothing to warrant such praise) and kids hugging teachers in front of everyone. Harry would have been beaten up and bullied for being a boy of twelve who cuddles into his teacher like a wimpy little girl. And the preceding scene where Lucius confronts Harry was also cavity-inducing with the modest hero of the novels coming across as an arrogant, smug little brat. Kloves not only needs to re-read the book but he should spend more time with real kids at high school if this is how he thinks they conduct themselves.While CoS was enjoyable enough, it was still a mediocre take of the novel. It was evident that it was produced to keep little kids happy rather than a love for the series or to please the actual fans. I did like it but I still feel so envious of the LotR fans who get an epic film trilogy that matches up to the excellence of books and I wonder if HP will ever be that great.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Spectacular,"The second movie of the Harry Potter series taking you to the fantastic world of Hogwarts, i love it.it Even though many exiting plots were deleted while filming it is still a classical movie which is significant to see.

Another year and more wizarding adventures,"Since the world has already been introduced to the wonderful wizarding world of Harry Potter and Hogwarts, and since all the major characters have all been introduced, what else is there to do to make the other movies special? In the second installment, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, and Tom Felton all return to their magical school for another year. Somehow, even though they were all placed in a great deal of danger the previous school year, no one expects anything bad might happen. Bad things do happen, and even though the school is host to a staff of enormously competent and powerful wizards and witches, the little children find it's up to them to save the day! It's quite an accomplishment for the three heroes, since there's an army of giant spiders living in the forest, a mysterious villain lurking in the halls who literally petrifies its victims, and a magical diary with its own hidden agenda. Get ready to cut young Harry Potter some slack and keep in mind that he's only twelve years old and liable to make some pretty big mistakes; if you found a talking diary, would you confide in it?Ironically, the second novel was my favorite of the series, but I don't watch the second film very often. The most memorable part of this installment-even more than the famous diary-is the arrival of Dobby the House Elf. While the little kiddies might be endlessly entertained by his scenes, I couldn't get past his squeaky voice. He's written that way in the book, but imagining his voice and having to sit through it in a movie are two different things. Probably the third most memorable part of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets can be summed up by Rupert Grint's line: ""Follow the spiders? Why couldn't he have said, 'Follow the butterflies?'"" Anyone out there who's afraid of spiders, let alone allergic to their bites, probably won't want to watch this movie very often either. When doing a marathon, as I recently did with my nieces, it's just blasphemous to skip any of the films, so you'll have to just close your eyes or use the spider scene as a popcorn break.There are some fun parts to this movie, though, so when you're watching a marathon with your nieces, you'll be able to have fun once you return from getting more popcorn. Kenneth Branagh ""guest stars"" as a hilariously conceited and incompetent new teacher who has girls swooning at every turn. John Williams's beautiful music is still used, and the new themes he wrote for the second movie are just as lovely as in the original. The kids decide to go undercover by making a magic potion that turns their appearance into whoever they've stolen a hair from, and Emma Watson's potion backfires with a pinch of cat hair. And don't forget, this is the movie with the flying car! With all that to focus on, who cares about a few spiders and a squeaky voice?Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to an upsetting scene involving an animal as well as scary scenes involving spiders and snakes, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

My favourite Harry Potter film in the franchise.,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" remains a standout in the franchise, and revisiting it after so many years only reaffirmed its status as a favorite. What makes this sequel particularly memorable is its faithful adaptation of the source material, closely following the events of the book while introducing captivating new characters, settings, and creatures.The film successfully embraces a darker tone, setting the stage for a more intense and thrilling adventure. From the introduction of Dobby the house elf to encounters with the Basilisk and Aragog, each new element adds depth and excitement to the story. The presence of iconic locations like the Whomping Willow and the Chamber of Secrets itself further immerses viewers in the magical world of Hogwarts.Despite its lengthy runtime, the movie maintains a brisk pace, ensuring that the action unfolds seamlessly without dragging. The ensemble cast delivers strong performances once again, with standout additions like Kenneth Branagh as the eccentric Gilderoy Lockhart adding to the film's charm.Memorable moments abound, from the exhilarating chase with Aragog to Harry's showdown with the Basilisk. These scenes, combined with impressive special effects that have stood the test of time, make for a truly immersive cinematic experience.Overall, ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" stands as a testament to the enduring appeal of J. K. Rowling's wizarding world. It's a fantasy film that continues to captivate audiences with its rich storytelling, memorable characters, and magical charm.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Better Than the First One,"""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" has better special effects than the first one.I lost count at six teams of special effect companies, including Industrial Light and Magic, but doubtless each one had different responsibilities, whether the wonderful Hogwart's Hall, or the spiders, or the flue powder travel, or the flying car, etc.Even at three hours not all the story details can be told, so the actors have to quickly mouth a lot of exposition.Too bad the excellent Brit actors are reined in, even Kenneth Branaugh.Only the red-haired kid emotes much.At least the music is less bombastically intrusive than the last one.So even with all the whiz bang it still isn't as magical as The Wizard of Oz.(originally written 12/24/2002)",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Harry Potter and the Dumbest of Sequels,"""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" is an ultra-long, boring mess of a movie. Of course, like all movies of its kind, it has a huge cult following. Living in the UK, it's even more popular than in the States, where I first experienced its major influence. The books by J.K. Rowling made ""children read again."" So the next logical course of action is inevitably to make a huge-budget movie adaptation and therefore eliminate all advancements made in literature. What's that? Kids are starting to read again? Then why don't we make a two-and-a-half-hour-long movie, in seven parts, that will negate this and cause them to start watching TV again?The first ""Harry Potter"" movie (subtitled ""And the Sorcerer's Stone,"" or ""The Philosopher's Stone"" if you live in Britain) was OK, but rather predictable, not to mention utterly silly and far too long. I give kudos to Rowling for managing to totally rip off Roald Dahl's unique style of storytelling without crediting him at all. I'll even thank her for managing to make a book that pretends to take place in reality, yet abandons all reasonable concepts of life (such as...how in the world do you get a job as an honor graduate of Wizard School?). Heck, I'll even smile at the thought that she's managed to turn the image of sorcerers, witches, and such evil, into a pleasant little happy-go-lucky book that thins the line between Good and Bad. Christian fundamentalist groups originally held anti-Harry Potter ceremonies after the initial novel and film's release a few years ago. The media acted as if they were crazy. Okay, maybe they went a little overboard. But it's not like Rowling is treading on quaint, cheerful material here. The main character, Harry Potter, goes to a school named Hogwarts (get it?), where children learn the arts of Witchcraft and Wizardry. They recite little lines of evil dialogue that make spells happen. This is treated all rather calmly and gentile...but of course what Rowling (who used to dabble in a bit of black magic herself, and was on the verge of suicide before the idea for Harry Potter ""popped into"" her head) is doing is quite clear: She's blurring the lines of decency. One baby step at a time.It sounds silly, doesn't it? Maybe. But regardless, ""Harry Potter"" itself is a tremendously boring movie. It's devoid of any imagination. ""Labyrinth,"" which it seems to borrow its style from, is far superior and far more unique.The movie is about a poor sap that is knocked down in real life (maybe because he wears the most dorky glasses in the world?) and therefore takes comfort in knowing that he is the last savior of mankind. What a minute...that sounds like ""The Matrix""...actually this is about something totally different, but I've lost my train of thought. Watching this movie will do that to you.Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), now in his second year at Hogwarts, is faced with the reality that recent student paralysis may be attributed to a dark lord who killed his parents and gave him a lightning bolt scar across his forehead (which mysteriously disappears between shots). Soon Harry finds out that his life is in danger and he may be...well...in danger! No duh.Okay, this might have made a rather good 90-minute movie. ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" is about 150 minutes long. I saw it in the theater when it was released two years ago and almost fell asleep. I thought I was the only one until one of my friends nudged my and said, ""This is the most boring movie I've ever seen.""Interestingly enough, all the individuals who seemed to enjoy the movie in the theater were little kids all hyper on sugar-packed Coca-Cola, running around the theater screaming, ""Harry Potter!"" Of course no one ran around the theater but I started imagining how funny it would be if...Where was I?The movie was directed by Christopher Columbus, who sailed to America in 1492. Of course in 1942 ""Casablanca"" was released, which didn't star Columbus, or any of his relatives. Which reminds me: It's a much better movie; go see it instead of this. And of course I'm not talking about *the* Christopher Columbus, but rather Chris Columbus, who is the writer of ""Gremlins"" and who directed the John Hughes-scripted ""Home Alone."" Columbus was very good during the '80s and early '90s, but it seems he's lost his sense of utter imagination that he used to have.""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" might have made a good 90-minute kiddie movie. As a 2.5-hour movie, it's almost unbearable. Let's hope the new installment - which is rumored to be more ""adult"" if that is at all possible - is better. I'd rather be thrown into a gas chamber than have to see this ""Chamber"" again. I'd even rather watch ""The Chamber"" with Chris O'Donnell. Am I rambling?",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Worth the price of admission.,"Warning to those who are avid fans of J.K. Rowling--I LOATHE the Harry Potter books.  Yes, I have read them.  I find her writing to be more than a little plagiaristic of the style of C.S. Lewis, but without the skill that he employed.  That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed both this and the first movie.  Frankly, I don't care if the scriptwriters left this bit or that bit out; it is simply impossible for all parts of any novel to be completely included in a film without turning it into an epic of a minimum of seven hours, which is ridiculous.  That is the nature of a film; much over two-and-a-half hours and the theatres are only going to be able to show a limited number of screenings, which will, of necessity, limit the profit to be made on the film--and the bottom line of any film project is ""How much of a profit will it make?"".  (And, of course, how many people are going to be able to sit through it without multiple bathroom breaks?  I had to run out myself once, cursing, just when they were about to ""follow the spiders""...)I found the casting to be clever and appropriate; of special note is, of course, the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore (and I wonder if they will make the obvious choice to replace him in the next movie with Max von Sydow, who could be made to look and sound exactly the same?) as well as the return of Robbie Coltrane and Alan Rickman.  Both of these actors can actually act, as opposed to simply being screen personalities.  The visual effects are stunning, although just a little too obviously digital in more than a few cases.  The story is easily followed, which is more than I could say for the original books.  The pacing was almost perfect; I only looked at my watch twice--my measure for a movie in which I am immersed.  Both times occurred, I might add, when I was distracted by Rupert Grint's voice obviously cracking--they're going to have to do something about the fact that their stars are definitely more than a few miles down the road of adolescence.This movie, of course, is raking in the cash.  Deservedly so; it's not by any stretch of the imagination a movie of any deep and lasting meaning, but it gives good value for one's entertainment dollar, and at the scandalous prices that movie admissions are reaching now, that is certainly a ringing endorsement.  It was able to take me away from the insanity of a stressful holiday season, and for that reason alone I was completely satisfied.  See if it can do the same for you.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

It has a wonderful story, wonderful characters, great action sequences, and good humour to balance it all out.  I've heard a lot of arguments for the actors playing the trio being too old for the parts, but I think people fail to realise that the characters age as well, not to mention the fact that in most movies/tv shows there are much older people playng ""teens"", so for Emma, Daniel, Tom, and Rupert I don't think that there age difference is really that big, but I digress.  This movie is fun and exciting, it crosses age groups (seeing as how when I first saw it I was 22, my mum was 60, and my neice was 8...and we all loved it)I can't wait till June '04 to see the next exciting installment :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

He has to traverse the Chamber of Secrets to find out who's writing mysterious messages on the school hallways and why people have been petrified. It's up to Harry who has the ability to speak and understand snake talk to save the day. This sequel to an enjoyable little film is better because it can do away with the exposition that the first had to show, and concentrate more on the story, which is deeper and a tad darker than before. I even enjoyed Hermione more in this film, but as is true with the ying and yang, so is true with a hatred of a character in the film, and it's been transfered from Hermione to the awful character of Moaning Myrtle, yea I know she plays an integral part in the plot line of the film, but I still couldn't help but detest her.

Wanted: A Director,"I didn't much like the second Harry Potter movie. I think the blame lies squarely with Chris Columbus; Alfonso Cuaron should do a much better job with the next movie. Columbus never builds tension into his shots by holding them longer than necessary to communicate a plot point. His camera angles never seem to do more than tell a direct narrative. Unlike plays, movies can force the audience to view the actors according to the very specific intentions of the director, accomplished by the angle, the lens, lighting, etc. Columbus does this somewhat, but not enough.The acting was excellent and the sets and effects were spectacular as expected. But the series deserves a director with imagination, a director who is willing to be more than Rowling's lapdog, a director who will make a movie instead of an adaptation. Hopefully Cuaron will be that director.One might make the argument that the audience should not expect a fantasy to hold up to the standards of Citizen Kane. But Lord of the Rings is a fantasy, and Peter Jackson is just as aware of what a camera is capable of as Orson Welles was. Both Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings feature enthralling magical worlds, brilliant British acting, fantastically detailed sets, costumes, and effects, and a wonderful score.

There was not a lot of Hermoine in this one, this sequel kind of seemed like a buddy cop movie between Harry and Ron. The twist with moaning Myrtle is so shocking that it pulls this film together. This film also brings more hype to the eventual villain Voldemort. After the first one, you can tell this film got a bigger budget because there was more intense and cooler effects than the first.

Good fun but not quite so fresh,"I was one of those people that read Philosopher's Stone after I'd seen the film. Enjoyed it so much I read the other three books, all excellent. Problem is though, because I'd seen the film first, the pictures you conjure up in your mind while reading the other books all tend to follow the faces and locations that you have seen in the film, you simply adapt it to the new plots and locations. Chamber of Secrets is pretty much exactly as I pictured it when reading the book. In fact as the closing credits rolled I felt like I had seen it before...This isn't a criticism at all, the film-makers have done a great job of translating this book to the big screen, far more thoroughly than Philosopher's Stone. With this film there isn't too much that's left out.Whilst I know Chamber Of Secrets is gonna get (and is already getting) loads of fantastic reviews, I have to say I found it a bit flat. I thought the first film was great fun and quite magical, although I'm afraid I disagree that the acting was great. Personally I thought the 3 children leads were pretty poor, especilly Emma Watson as Hermione (the way she delivers some lines made me cringe!) People often pass-off child performances as ""well they're only children"", but watch Natalie Portman in Leon or Haley Joel Osment to see quality child acting! Not much has changed here, although it is amusing to hear Harry and Ron with newly acquired broken voices... they'll be shaving next!Apart from a larger part for Richard Harris (excellent as Dumbledore - will be sadly missed), it seemed that Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid and the wonderful Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall hardly had any screen time in this one. Perhaps it was that way in the book, can't remember. Shame though...Was disappointed in the Quidditch match here. Being one of the best scenes in the first film, I expected a full-on assault for Chamber Of Secrets. We join the game towards the end, it consists mainly of Harry and Malfoy flying round and round underneath the seating stalls and is over way too quickly.Kenneth Branagh seemed a very strange choice for the hilarious Gilderoy Lockhart. I always imagined a character like Terry Thomas when reading the books. I never thought I'd say this about Kenneth Branagh, but he actually seems to under-play the part (rather than wallop it with a sledgehammer like he usually does).One thing that did bug me... the sound-track. The Philosophers Stone was great. Another classic John Williams score. Problem is, rather than write a new score that kept the main spirit of the original (which John Williams did brilliantly in the Star Wars trilogy), they seemed to have lifted entire bits of music used in the first film, particularly the dramatic parts that you associate with a certain scene from Philosophers Stone, and transplanted it into Chamber Of Secrets! Couldn't help thinking... cheap... cheap... cheapThree of us went to see this film at a preview screening last night, and chatting afterwards we all felt basically the same way. Good film, good fun, but lacking the ""spark"" that made the first film so magical. Maybe because part of the fun of Philosopher's Stone was being introduced to this strange, quirky new world and its characters. In Chamber Of Secrets, we are now familiar with this so the story takes centre stage, and at the end of the day... it aint that strong.7/10",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Enjoyable characters,"I really like this movie, even more than the first.  It is imaginative with the special effects, many of them done with a warm sense of humor.Best of all are the characters.  Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy and Jason Isaacs as Draco's father Lucius are hissable.  Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid is huggable.  Richard Harris as Dumbledore is honorable.The pinnacle is the chemistry of the three main characters.  Daniel Radcliffe as Harry, Emma Watson as Hermione and Rupert Grint (which could be a great character name itself) as Ron Weasley act like they are true friends to the end.  I especially like Emma as Hermione.  She is such a darling!A great adventure.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Maybe it's just a place holder, but it remains an essential part of the series.","With boy wizard Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) going into his second year at Hogwarts, he gets visited by a ""house elf"" named Dobby, who warns him not to go. Naturally, Harry doesn't listen to this. But when he does arrive at the school, he finds that there's a number of things not right. And the answer is closer than he thinks.Obviously, the filmmakers couldn't go straight from ""Philosopher's Stone"" to ""Prisoner of Azkaban"", so they had to include ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"". This is probably the HP movie which I recommend the least (but make no mistake, I do recommend it). Sometimes, it just seems like a big Hollywood production, but I consider it a good movie nonetheless. The Oregonian's review correctly stated that it maintained the first movie's strength and flaws. Radcliffe plays Potter to perfection, while Rupert Grint and Emma Watson also return as Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, respectively. Aside from the other cast members from the original (Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, Richard Griffiths), there are two new ones: Kenneth Branagh as Gilderoy Lockhart (the overstuffed Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher) and Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy (Draco's father). Overall, worth seeing, but I liked ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" better (I still haven't seen part 4).",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Wonderful movie - the time flew by!!,"My sister & I (both 50ish) went with her husband and 13-year old daughter. We all absolutely loved it.

Help: Series in Search of Vision,"Harry and friends solve a new mystery, while getting better acquainted with their talents. This adventure sees them tackle another quidditch match, a flying car, giant spiders and the like.Made at a time when the Harry Potter book series had been fully recognized for what it was - an unstoppable literary phenomenon - Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets, the movie, embodies a disappointing lack of courage and compromise from its ,makers: adapt as much as you can from the increasingly long books seems to be the motto du jour. The result is a lumbering 160 minute film that manages to shy away from the darker elements of the book. As such, there is little sense of threat (the aforementioned giant spiders are underused) and the numbing length and uneven pace make this a tough film to enjoy, particularly for non-Potter fans.It's time Columbus left. His greatest legacy will remain the casting an launching of the Potter machine. But still, other than aim at maximum faithfulness, the films have accomplished little so far, except fatten Rowling's and Warner Brothers' coffers.

Better than the First,"Able to do away with with character introductions the second Harry Potter film can move straight on with action.Although the film still suffers from being a bit too long the film has nowhere near as many draggy parts as the first one. If anything its the rabbit to the first one's turtle.Set pieces involving Ron's magic flying car are wonderful, and the spiders in this film would give the spider in Return of the King a run for their money.If you liked the first film, or even if you didn't, give this film a try since its a large step in the right direction of fantasy films.(Although a large cash reward for the remains of that annoying house elf will be paid if it can be promised that I will never have to set eyes on him again.)",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Impressed of the design,"from the camera angles used and the promise to make a darker film Chris Columbus has delivered, I was impressed with the use of water in this film giving the depth of perception to a new height.

I believe Daniel, Emma and Rupert have progressed wonderfully and cant wait to see more as I believe they have the potential to not become type cast into these roles and of course Mr Coletrane toped it off need I say more?

If You Believe in Magic,"Heroic young Daniel Radcliffe (as Harry Potter) hopes to spend a second year at ""Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry"". But, the 12-year-old is warned against attending, by a computer-generated ""house elf"" named ""Dobby"" (voiced by Toby Jones). The little imp prevents Mr. Radcliffe from getting summer letters from pals like red-haired Rupert Grint (as Ron Weasley) and spunky Emma Watson (as Hermione Granger); and, he even manages to block the magical entrance the youngsters use to catch their train to school. So, Radcliffe has to hitch a ride with Mr. Grint in a flying car. Don't fret. Eventually, the lads arrive at ""Hogwarts"", where they become embroiled in one of the magic school's darkest secrets.This second ""Harry Potter"" film was produced in quick succession, and is quite like the first. The trio of young performers are beginning to make the characters their own, which means they seem slightly different than in J.K. Rowling's original novel. The older actors are, of course, marvelous. Notably, noble Richard Harris (who played Albus Dumbledore) died just before the film was released. It's interesting to see the relatively unknown Christian Coulson (as Tom Riddle) trump accomplished Kenneth Branagh (as Gilderoy Lockhart) in the villain department.

What a Completely Awful Attempt at Film Making!!!,"I have to say, I was rather impressed with Sorcerer's Stone. Thinking that this movie would be the same, being that it is a sequel, I scraped together the $17.00 to see this movie in the theatre. Needless to say, I was more than disappointed, as this movie was completely horrible. There should have been a notice printed outside of the theatre that read, ""Notice, this movie sucks!"" I was thoroughly disappointed, and don't know if I can express my discontent in 1,000 words, so I'll cut to the point. If you are interested in Harry Potter at all, and have yet to see the movies, you should see the first one, ask a friend to sum up the gist of the second movie (should take roughly 25 seconds) then go rent the third one from the library, so you won't get charged to see that horrible (but not quite as horrible as CoS) movie. All in all, I have to say, I don't understand the hype behind these overly stylized, no plot havin', character (Dumbledore) changing movies to begin with.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
This Movie Is MAGIC!,"I was lucky to see a special preview of this movie last night and can highly recommend it, it is even better than the original movie. All the actors seem to be enjoying themselves immensely and there are a lot of funny scenes that will make you laugh out loud. It is a much more darker movie than the first but is a very faithful adaptation of the book. Kenneth Branagh is perfectly cast as foppish Gilderoy Lockhart and Jason Isaacs is a very sinister Lucius Malfoy. A special mention must go to Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley, his facial expressions are superb, especially during the slug scene!Go and see this movie, I can guarantee you won't be disappointed, 10/10.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

I adore Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson is sensational.  I hope they stay in these roles through every movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
An improvement over the first.,"While the first Harry Potter was just entertaining, the second one luckily provides more than just that.Good thing about sequels is that they don't have to waste time on character introduction anymore since we already know the main characters from the first movie. ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" also introduce some new fresh character, yet again played by an amazing list of well known actors. Favorite is Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy, Draco's father and Kenneth Branagh as Gilderoy Lockhart.The movie has more story and depth than the first movie had, but still yet again the ending doesn't feel fitting. I did some thinking about it what it is that makes the endings of Harry Potter movies so bad and I came to the following conclusion; The movie is basically about and relies on the three main characters Harry, Ron and Hermione, towards the ending Harry Potter always has to face 'evil' on his own, without Ron and Hermione. I think this is the reason why the endings always feels so out of place, without Ron and Hermione, Harry Potter is quite boring and not at his best.The movie still has some other downers, such as Dobby the House Elf and the fact that it still relies too much on the book, with as a result too many pointless characters and moments and some elements that are never completely clear for people who never read the books (such as myself).But thankfully the movie has more ups than downs. Visually the movie looks wonderful with nice costumes and sets. Also the special effects have improved big time! The game of quidditch looks far better and more realistic than it did in the first movie.Entertaining movie, an improvement over the first.

a good adaption,"'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' is a pretty good adaption of the second book in the Potter series. In this book, Harry is warned by a house elf not to go back to Hogwarts school. Strange things start to happen, and a new portal is opened up, and this forces Harry to meet and to learn more about his enemy. It is up to Harry to become the hero again while trying to fit in.The film introduces more special effects and action than the first film, but I thought it was a weaker story than the first book. (That, of course, is my personal preference.) The giant spiders and giant snake are pretty realistic (spider-phobes and snake-phobes beware).This film is another success for the Harry Potter story, and I think that fans are overall pleased. It's got the innocent and fun-loving characters that the original had, which is why the story is so popular, and combine this with the action and you get a successful film. My only problem is that I did not find this story as interesting as the other Potter books, and I felt that some of the acting was not the best...still, I don't think it distracted from the story. Overall, job well done and a good adaption.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Picks Up Where It Left Off,"The first sequel doesn't seem to skip a beat. I still like the first, simply because it was so fascinating to see this magical world brought to life. But even so, 'Chamber of Secrets' was able to add a little bit to that world; whether it was the introduction of Dobby the house elf, Lucius Malfoy, or diving deeper into Hogwarts and the ever dangerous Dark Forest.The book itself is probably actually my least favourite. It is still very good, I just gravitated to the others more.Even though this movie is twenty years old, I only just discovered that this has a post credit scene, and that it's the only Harry Potter movie with one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Good continuation but Chris can't quite deliver the knock out punch,"The franchise continues in the second movie in the series. There is a good step upwards in the quality of FX, CGI, and sets. We get introduced to Dobby, the house elf. He's a good CGI character. More importantly, he's a likable character which is so different from a certain Star Wars character who shall not be named. It's a big relief that Dobby is a good success.If there is something missing, it's a darker and scarier Chamber of Secrets. With so much built up, the final section should be a more thrilling and scary ride. It's like a horror movie that doesn't deliver in the end. I think Chris Columbus has reached his limits. It's just not in him to deliver the mood, the thrills, or the scary moments.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The most underrated movie in the series,"I don't know if it's because I watched this one first when I was 7 and it's the reason I fell in love with the series or because this one was the most faithful adaptation, not only in the series, probably one of the most faithful adaptations ever. Child actors are a little older (and better) in this movie, the atmosphere is really magical and adult actors as great as always and I don't even have to say anything about the score. This one is probably my 2nd favorite movie in the series. Effects look a bit fake at some parts but aside from that, everything was perfect. When I saw the first movie after reading a book, I liked it, but it felt kinda rushed. In this one, everything was great. It had all plot elements from the book (I think), it was darker, more thrilling but this one may scare the children a little (boo, spiders!). From new actors in the series, I was overwhelmed by Kenneth Branagh as a new arrogant professor Gilderoy Lockhart and some of his scenes still make me laugh out load. Not only him, but Shirley Henderson as Moaning Myrtle too. All in all, this is a really enjoyable fantasy and one of the most faithful adaptations ever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A MAGICAL HARRY POTTER FILM THAT'S 20 MINUTES TOO LONG!,"""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" is as magical as its predecessor, ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's/Philosopher's Stone."" All praises I had from the first film (acting, storyttelling, everything else) stayed in the second film. As for flaws, this second HP film has some1.) IT'S TOO LONG!! The first 30 minutes of the movie could have been shortened to 15 minutes as those scenes did not need to be that long.2.) Too much & too ""on the nose"" set-ups/exposition. A lot of things were explained/set-up for upcoming scenes. Some were very obvious while others made the film 5 minutes too long. Such scenes include: the ""baby trees"" teaching scene where the teacher said they can unpetrify students, Justin telling Harry he's muggle-born and Ron's broken wand.3.) What's up with the Weasley car!? They never explained that.Overall, if not for the 3 reasons above, this film could have been y good as its predecessor. Sadly, it's slightly not as good.

"A Magical, Snake-Infested Roller Coaster!","Let's be real - ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" is like that one friend who's always a bit too dramatic, but you love them anyway. From the get-go, we're thrust into Harry's world where cars fly (and crash), trees fight back, and spiders hold conventions. It's like a theme park designed by a wizard on a sugar high.The film somehow makes you nostalgic for a school you never attended. Hogwarts in this installment is less 'charming castle' and more 'mystery dungeon with a basilisk problem.' Speaking of which, that basilisk deserves an award for 'Best Dramatic Entrance.' It's like the BeyoncÃ© of serpentine monsters - absolutely fabulous, but you wouldn't want to meet it in a dark corridor.What really ties it all together is the trio - Harry, Ron, and Hermione. They're like the magical version of the Three Musketeers, if the Musketeers were constantly breaking school rules and tackling issues way above their pay grade. Their misadventures, coupled with the whimsical chaos of Hogwarts, make this film a spellbinding experience. It's a wild ride through a world where the most unbelievable part is not the magic, but the fact that these kids still attend classes while solving ancient snake-related mysteries. Four stars for sheer enchantment and the courage to face giant spiders without an exterminator!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Watchable, but not great.","I didn't think ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" was an improvement over the first Harry Potter movie.  The special effects were better for the most part, but this time I didn't walk out of the theater with the feeling of having seen something reasonably exciting, magical, well-scripted and entertaining, as I did last time.  The movie looked like a montage of disjointed episodes, each of which was there mainly for the purpose of showing off its special effects.  It had valuable moments (both visually and conceptually, and more of the former), but those were few.Now, this film is considered by many to be much ""darker"".  I agree: the overwhelming quantity and frequency of various monsters are enough to inflict nightmares on younger children.  Still, the danger almost never feels real, its emotional and visual level remaining at that of a video game.Of the Harry Potter series, I only read the first book, and although I found it well-written, it was nothing my imagination hadn't been challenged with before.  Knowing that the second film sticks pretty closely to the original, I would say my criticism is directed in equal measure towards the books: despite some entertaining, perhaps even original moments along the way, there is just not enough substance to either the plot or the underlying ideas.  The film medium has a chance to bring out the best in Rowling's writings, which is why in this rare case I prefer Harry Potter movies over Harry Potter books, but these movies inevitably inherit the books' fundamental flaws.All in all, ""The Chamber of Secrets"" wasn't a waste of my time, but it lacked coherence and, more importantly, sincerity and confidence in the messages it was trying to get across, and as a result, it had little impact.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Magical sequel.,"Based on the book Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, this is the second film in the Harry Potter film trilogy, a story about Harry Potter who is rescued from the clutches of his neglectful aunt and uncle and a bratty cousin from his Hogwarts friend, Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), and taken back to the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in a flying car. From this scene on, you will know this will be an magical and adventurous movie filled with surprises and spells. Harry ends up back at the school, despite warnings not to return, and hears mysterious voices from inside the school's walls. He also learns that muggle-born students (students born from humans, not witches) are being attacked and soon everybody discovers that the Chamber of Secrets has been opened. What follows is a daring mission to discover the Chamber and to solve the ongoing crises.Witches Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) and Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith) and the school's all-powerful headmaster, Albus Dumbledore (Richard Harris), return in this sequel, providing another mystical performance.Like the first film, I think this movie followed J.K. Rowling's novel very well, including in it most details that capture the imagination, magic, adventure and drama of the story. Director Chris Columbus and the team of writers and special effects people gave again a pretty entertaining and believable movie, with some more heart-pounding action than the previous film.Overall, it's a good sequel and I think is one of the best in the series altogether.Grade B+",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Harry Potter & The Chamber Of Secrets Film Review,"The second installment of the franchise unfortunately was Richard Harris' last before his death. In this film we see a development of two major characters in Dumbeldore & Tom Riddle(Voldemort). Dumbledore is magnificently played by Harris as a warm & enchanting character with a big heart & soft spot for Harry. Harry starts to face his true demon in this film with Voldemort playing even more powerful mind games. We still do not see Voldemort in the flesh however his presence as the character is widely seen through Harry's character. Watch for the wand duel between Malfoy & Harry when Harry speaks parcel tongue, this scene is very intriguing & an interesting part of the story. More gruesome than the first film & possibly better, this Potter sequel is brilliant. Kenneth Branagh steals the show as the new professor & is very funny however Jason Issacs is ideal as the evil yet prestigious Luscious Malfoy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

booooring with a complete lack of magic...,"I consider myself a good critic of fantasy/children films...Mostly due to my attention span never developing beyond the age of 7 and my hunger for magical things being so alive I kept the stupid window to my room open for Peter Pan at the age of 14...Oh I knew he was not real, but what is the point of rubbing that in...Therefore, me falling asleep during the first Harry Potter film and fighting with sleep during the second one definitely means SOMETHING...I must admit I didn't really expect much in the first place; creating a huge movie from a popular book ON DEMAND can never spell art, but I thought maybe, MAYBE, it could be fun...Not only was I disappointed by the fact that bits and pieces were cut out completely (Ok, I understand the necessity) but why add USELESS parts then that could be found nowhere in the book and add cheapness to the already bad movie?? (Indiana Jones scene of almost falling out of the flying car in the second movie? Artistic freedom? What artist? What art?) Not to mention the fact that if we hadn't read the book we would not care at all about the characters of the film since they are never really developed in the movie...It is hard for us to notice this fact since we do heavily rely on our memory of the book to follow the movie; yet the fact that there is very little connection between the audience and the kids does subconsciously ruin a great deal...Bland conversations, overdone special effects (was Dobby really THAT freaky and unlovable looking?? Since when??? Couldn't we have a touch less computer graphics and a bit more human touch?) and cheap shots at making us laugh...mostly relying on Ron saying things like: ""can we go now, I am scared"" (insert a stupid and annoying facial expression)...Where did the subtle darker humor go? Basically, it is sad to note that this may be the fantasy children movie of the new generation...No memorable original moments, humor or truly magical scenes (ET, Goonies, Time bandits, Mary Poppins etc)...Basing it all on computer animation, special effects, plot and mooooney...Brainwashed kids will like it, adults will forget what to look for and we can all be convinced that since the media tells us it is grand, then it must be so...A good fantasy movie is not supposed to make us bored, not even for a minute; it is supposed to keep us wanting to see certain scenes again and again, making us remember the movie as something we find special and original, and I just cannot wait to see that scene where Harry is walking and then he stops and says something!!!!!

Enjoyable with decent (if over indulgent) plot,"Trapped at his home by his foster family, Harry is visited by a house elf and warned not to return to Hogwarts as it holds great danger for him. However this only serves to make him want to go all the more, despite the fact that many barriers seem to spring up in his path.  When he arrives there he finds much changed, not least a new teacher in the shape of Professor Lockhart.  The danger arrives when someone opens the mythical (and hidden) chamber of secrets and releases a beast that aims to kill all the mixed blood wizards.  Himself a suspect, Harry must race to find not only the beast, but also the one who released it, before it kills again.After having a poor impression from the first film, I decided to skip this at the cinema Â the idea of an average film being worth the horror of sharing a cinema with talking children being a major factor.  However on DVD I decided to give it a go and was happy to see that it was actually quite an enjoyable film that has a good plot to it.  I still feel that the running time (almost 3 hours) is far too long for this type of film and that some brave editor needs to take it and really be harsh with the material, the plot here sort of demands the long run but at times scenes are too indulgent and the cuts to reduce time could have been found without too much loss.The film does move quite easily though, despite the 3 hour run.  The problem is that children will generally lose interest faster than adults, making it harder on the rest of us to stay with the film Â I mean, how many toilet breaks will be taken during this film?  Despite this I did find it involving and the film kindly tailored itself to be user-friendly to both fans and those like me who have never had the desire to read a single HP book.  The material is probably too dark for children and I doubt many younger than 10 will actually have followed the full run of the narrative.The action scenes are an area that could have been trimmed down.  I don't know if the film is trying to stay very true to the book but I did feel that some scenes (the flying car, the Quidditch games) could have been either reduced or removed altogether.  Some scenes work very well and are exciting and creepy and this is due to better direction (maybe from not feeling the pressure of starting a franchise?) and also some very good effects.The cast is still deep in faces and again suffers from not having enough for everyone to do.  Radcliffe is a bit better in the lead role but Watson and Grint seem to have been put back into second place despite being a real strength of the first film.  Rickman is enjoyable and Branagh is a good choice for the character of Lockhart, OTT enough to be a comedy character but not so much a clown that he is ruled out as a possible bad guy.  Richard Harris has little to do and it is sad that when he died most obituaries in the popular press made reference to this role rather than any of his massive back catalogue.  Cleese is once again wasted, Maggie Smith gets a few days work out of it and Coltrane serves only as a red herring at several points along the way.  Faces from British comedy make for local interest but again it is a problem that the film tries to have the same rich tapestry of characters that I imagine the book did Â at some point a disciplined focus is required in this series, imagine the running times once they start making the thicker books in the series with the same approach!Overall I had no intention of ever watching this film but am glad I gave it a shot.  I still feel that it is a little over indulgent and that it needs to be better controlled, but the good plot and enjoyable set pieces made for a good film.  I have not been won over enough to see the next chapter in the cinema but I'll get it on video a few years later.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

The camerawork is well done and there's some really nice colour palettes, with every shot being very well lit!

The sound design, especially in the chamber of secrets, it very well crafted and feels super ominous!This film adds some great new characters to the franchise, and has so many iconic actors! The friendships between the characters are so sweet and it's clear the actors had a lot of chemistry while filming. The actor who plays Tom Riddle does a phenomenal job and genuinely feels intimidating at times. The dialogue is also well written, Dumbledore specifically has some great lines. My only criticism is that I really don't like Dobby and find him to be incredibly unlikeable.The pacing for this film is very steady and consistently entertaining with a strong sense of mystery.

Fun sequel filled with tongue in cheek humour and a great cast ensemble.,"Well, I think that when they made this one, what they were looking for was to remind the audience of why they liked the first one and for the first hour, they do just that and from there they move onto a darker and cleverer version of Harry. Now, in this one it seems that some actors who did maybe not so well in the first one were starting to really pick up in this one like Hermoine. Well, there was again lots of talk about this one like whether Daniel Radcliffe could keep up with the ever evolving character but he pulled it off with what seems like very little trouble although I doubt highly that it would not have been a little trouble. Well this one has better special effects then the first one and they had done a great job extending the characters to fit in with times and the effort used in this one is just so cleverly used. Once again, they got away with some scenes cut out in this one. I rate this 74%.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

"Obviously not a great fantasy film, but surprisingly, a good one","This is undeniably a better film than the last one, which is odd, since it's also undeniable that the second book is the weakest in the series. But perhaps it's not so odd. The first book, after all, is at its best in the opening chapters, in which we, more or less along with Harry, discover that there's a whole world of wizards and witches, that Harry is both talented in magic and an inadvertant celebrity, etc. It was these opening chapters that Coloumbus most thoroughly muffed when he made the screen version. In the first book, nothing that happens at Hogwarts can live up to the promise of the opening; in the first film, the arrival at Hogwarts is a relief after all the dutiful but tedious exposition.Here, Columbus doesn't even bother trying to do that which he cannot do well in any case, brings Harry to Hogwarts by the shortest route possible, and plunges into the Hogwarts story - which is, it must be admitted, a far better story than the last one. Both films conclude with Harry and companions sneaking into a kind of underground ""chamber of secrets"", but this quest has far less the nature of an arbitrary obstacle course; indeed, the last film had so much the nature of an arbitrary obstacle course that it might as well have been a game show.Pretty much everything is better the second time round. The creature effects are on average better (the basilisk actually WORKS), the art direction is better, the CGI is still a bit uneven but at its worst (i.e. on the Quidditch pitch) isn't quite so purely dreadful as it was last time, and John Williams's musical score is apter and more enchanting. (His music was the best thing in the film last time, and it is again, but this time it's richer and has been applied with a good deal more taste.) Kenneth Branagh makes a marvellous Gilderoy Lockhart. A pity he's under-utilised (as is everyone, to some degree); there's nobody else with comparable energy or charm in either film. Once again John Cleese has been dragged onto the set in order to appear on screen for a minute or so and to utter perhaps ten words in total.Columbus is still a pretty uninspired director, of course, and his dumbing down, his telling us everything twice and with words if possible so that even the slowest audience members get it, still earths the electricity we might otherwise have felt. (No doubt he dumbs down because he is making the film for children, but dumbing down for children has even less to be said for it than dumbing down for adults. If children fail to understand something, we can assume that they will grow smarter with age, and get it one day; whereas the adults too thick to get something are precisely those people who don't grow smarter with age and will never get it unless it IS dumbed down.) But all the same the direction is sharper and more assured than last time round. Columbus adheres less slavishly to the letter of Rowling's novel and the film is all the fresher for it. It's still true that more changes still should have been made. I wish Dobby had been written out of the script altogether, but given that he's there, I couldn't help longing for Columbus to summon up the courage to have him guillotined in the course of the film. I longed in vain.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Now we're getting somewhere!,"Yes, we all love the first one, but we gotta admit, it's whatever. This is when it starts to get juicy. There are frozen people and all the giant spiders are a BIG plus. There are many small fires throughout the movie in favor of lights, which leads me to believe that many attendees of Hogwarts will have lasting vision issues from strain on their eyes due to the dimness of the school.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The most underrated and most loyal of the Harry Potter movies (and better than the book),"It always shocked me when people rank this movie as the weakest of the 8. For people who have not read the books, I get it because this is considered the weakest of the books but for those who have read the books, I don't get why people would rank it low. This is easily the best Harry Potter movie in terms of how well it adapted the book. Aside from a couple of deleted scenes I wish they kept, there's nothing I would change.Chris Columbus nailed the darker tone of this movie, which suits the movie really well so while we still get some of the happiness and light tone from the 1st movie, this movie effectively is darker in tone, which makes sense given how dark the story is and it's very tonally inconsistent being dark when it needs to be but also bright and cheerful when it doesn't. Columbus truly understood the spirit of the book.The visuals of this movie have really improved as well and aged a lot better. The Quidditch scenes look more realistic, the set for the chamber matches the book description perfectly and the use of practical effects for Aragog, the Basilisk and the Mandrakes was a great idea to save money and they still hold up 18 years later. Dobby also looks impressive for 2002. The acting is much better here as well. Radcliffe seems to have grown more confident, Emma seems more natural but Rupert shines here with the best performance of the child actors and he has so many hilarious facial expressions. The new cast including Brannagh, Jones and Issac are amazing and they bring their character into film so well.I also love the added action scenes in the movie including when the Hogwarts Express almost crushes Harry and Ron's car, the attack of Aragog's family on Harry and Ron and the battle with the basilisk being extended. These action scenes are amazing with great CGI, clear stakes, always leaves the viewer on edge and are just frightening, which matches the genre of the film so well.The mystery aspect was nailed as well here. They managed to include every detail from the book to the film including the mirror, spiders scurrying away, the water and all that. It really shows how much Columbus cared about pleasing the fans, including details like that and also not creating any plot holes for those who have not read the books.Overall, this is an incredible sequel and adaptation that improves on the first film and book. It expands the world of Hogwarts beautifully, the casting was perfect and it captures the tone and vibe of the book so well. I'm sure this will please every book fam and I don't understand why this is so many people's least favorites.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets,"The magical power that came to Joan Rowling from a different world, pulls for itself, and the book is read in one breath."" Book Review, December 18, 2000The second book about the adventures of the young wizard Harry Potter world waited impatiently. And finally, he waited. ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" appears before the reader's eyes with a bright and original work. Of course, it relies on the first book, but it remains individual. ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" - a darker and more terrible book, unlike the first. So became the film. But the film and the book have not lost their charm and easy immediacy. It's still the same kind of fairy tale about the fight between good and evil, where good will certainly win.The magical world of Harry Potter has not changed. All the same oblique streets of London, the splendor of Hogwarts, the Forbidden Forest with its secret inhabitants, The slanting alley, the eerie Lute Lane, the unfriendly Rattling Willow, the huge school yard, the stunning quidditch. All this was preserved and was moved by magic wave in the second film, only slightly transformed. Hogwarts is a bright and active participant in all events. This castle, which became home for Harry, is no less important character than our young hero. Hogwarts carries in itself tying knowledge and great wisdom. This huge, majestic building knew a lot in its time. And all its secrets, its architecture and attract the eye.In ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" we meet the amazing and frightening creatures of the magical world. Dobby's elf is very cute and funny. In such a small, frail body is hidden a wide soul, suffering in vain. He does his best to protect Harry from danger. But Harry Potter, like a magnet, attracts them. Favorite animal Hagrid turns into an unpleasant monster - a giant giant spider Aragog. He is wise, old, but does not inspire confidence. And on top of everything, the mighty, dangerous serpent Basilisk appears on the screen. There are many legends about this snake, and Joan Rowling decided to add it to her epic. And, in principle, not in vain. He inspires reverence and horror, but at the same time a frank desire for Harry to finish him off quickly. Another amazing character in the film is Phoenix Fawkes. Amazing bird flown from the pages of the book to the screen. She is an ancient mythical creature, dying and rising from the ashes. It reminds us of the eternal cycle of life and death. Special effects in the film, in other ways, as in the first, not at altitude. But even seeing a few implausible spiders and a snake, you believe everything that is happening on the screen. The magical, mysterious, magical and frankly amazing world of Harry Potter draws and you just do not want to return to reality. Chris Columbus, who became the director of the Potters for the second time, could not lose the charm and atmosphere of the first film. Just the movie ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" became more sinister, frightening and full of dangers.Characters have not changed. Bright, alive, emotionally embodied on the screen of their heroes magnificent English actors. The cold and tough Potions master Severus Snegg performed by Alan Rickman, the same adamant Minerva McGonagall, the wise director of the Hogwarts School Albus Dumbledore (the eternal memory of Richard Harris, who died three weeks before the premiere of the film), the kind-hearted forester Hagrid. Pleased with new characters. Lucius Malfoy performed by Jason Isaacs is cruel, adamant. It just blows something negative and extremely unpleasant. Zlatopust Lokons is the life-builder, reclining on the laurels of others. He turned out to be too sugary, pretty, I would even say sugary. And, undoubtedly, the actor Kenneth Bran is on top. His character, or rather his performance, is very ironic. The unchanged trio of the main characters remained the same. Harry Potter is the star of the magical world, the orphan boy, who grew up in disgusting m",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Much better,"Harry Potter and the Sorceror's stone was great soley because it was Harry Potter (I am an avid fan).  This movie stands on its own as a film without falling back on the fact that people will love it anyway.  This was a great movie!!!  I highly recommend it.

Better than the first,"While I despised the first Harry Potter movie, this one proved to be much more engaging and better made than its predecessor. The kids obviously look more polished in this film, having actually learned something from the rather pitiful Chris Columbus. For posterity's sake, I'll give this film a 7/10 merely fro the fact that the special effects didn't look tacked on and the performances were much more grounded and realistic. All I can though, is we need more of the Weasleys! Just looking at them as a family is a hoot! Oh well, I'm rambling.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Better than the first!,"I was very surprised that this was better than the first.  Usually sequels are pretty bad, but this was entertaining.

The beginning is funny with his mean uncle and the cake.  This movie can be enjoyed by the whole family. Some parts might scare younger ones.  The film kept one guessing as to what would happen next.  Take the family to this one. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Chamber of secrets follows almost exactly the same story beats and has very similar set pieces to Philosopher's stone... to the point where the 2 films are practically interchangeable. The only difference really is the sense of wonder is missing from this second film, but on the plus side the child actors are much better and more confident here.

A prodigious original creative imagination,"The books by J. K. Rowling narrating Harry Potter's saga are indeed the product of a powerful creative imagination and an original one into the bargain. She creates an universe that lives entirely in her head around a school of wizards that is described in all its details, rules, habits and characters whatever odd or strange they may be making it to appear as real. The atmosphere of the school situates itself in an old mansion or castle or palace which lends it a Gothic atmosphere that adds mystery to the stories involved. This movie follows faithfully these features without losing its aesthetic autonomy as a movie (which is an art other than literature) translating the most thrilling moments of the book by effective visual effects. The fantastic scenes which we see, however, are not more thrilling than others shown on other fantastic movies. And of course we cannot forget this is a movie for children or teen-agers therefore we adults must forget our own values while watching it. Nevertheless, as usual, the general subject is the fight between Good and Evil which always ends with the latter's defeat though only temporary because in the following movie of the series that fight is resumed again. A good movie to entertain and amuse and nothing more.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Harry Potter and the Mansion of Tedium,"Just what is it about ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" that makes it so bland, so uninteresting?  I walked into the cinema on Friday night feeling a certain trepidation about the new HP film.  As one of the few remaining people on the planet who has never read an HP book, I wondered if spending the next two and a half hours in the company of Griffindellstumblebumhumblepiebumblebeepainintheass was really a sensible, grown-up thing to be doing.  It was not long before I had my answer.  No, it was not a sensible, grown-up thing to be doing.  As seemingly intelligent adults all around me cracked up at the hilarious antics of Valdemort and Fiddlededee and Sultanabran, I began to feel very uncomfortable indeed. Perhaps a pillow and a cup of cocoa would have helped.  Cinema seats are not designed for the sleepy.  To keep me awake, there staggered across the screen a succession of much-loved British character actors.  Oh, look, it's Julie Walters.  And that bloke from ""The Fast Show"".  And, oh, how lovely, it's cuddly Kenneth Branagh.  Marvellous.  Meanwhile our three heroes are proving, once and for all, that they cannot act.  The dolt who plays Harry has two expressions: ""I'm grinning"" and, ""I'm trying not to grin"".  The one who plays the other boy has one expression: ""I'm going to be sick"".  The girl has several, and is reasonably talented, but even she looks bored in this, and possibly very annoyed that she spends the second half of the film in a coma.  The plot, such as it is, can be summed up as follows: a succession of events occurs at the magical school of Hogwarts, or whatever the heck it's called.  HP sorts everything out.  The end.  The action (and I use the term very loosely indeed) is dull and plodding.  The special effects are bland and lifeless.  Each scene has no relation to the one before or after it.  The ""climax"", when it eventually arrives, is no more or less exciting than any other scene that has gone before it.  The entire film feels like it's been put together at random - some spiders here, a snake here, a flying car here, blah blah blah.  There is nothing magical or enchanting about this film.  It is dull and inane.  The only genuinely amusing moment comes when the boy who is not HP says, after the spider sequence, something along the lines of, ""What was the point of that, then?"" It's a very good question.  The scene (which probably cost twice as much as the whole of ""Monsoon Wedding"" or ""Ghost World"") has no reason to exist.  It serves no purpose.  It's not even scary. The entire film is two and a half hours of nothing at all.  And don't get me started on Quidditch.  As in HP1, the scene involving this pointless sport looks like it has come from an entirely different film.  The lighting is all wrong (being entirely computer-generated, this is not surprising, I suppose) and it jars with the rest of the movie. Two and a half hours of my life that I will never get back.  You'd think, after LOTR, TPM, AOTC and Spider bloody Man, that I'd have learned my lesson, wouldn't you?  Oh well.  If I can spare you the horror of this tedious drivel, then those two and a half hours will not have been totally wasted.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Love The Adaptation,"Just finished the book again and go straight to watch the adaptation. It was amazing. I love how the book and movie go great together. The movie makes the book even much better. Like the movie completes the book. As in Dobby hiding in the cupboard. In the book, Dobby stood silent, but the movie makes it more tense. Also with the cake and everything.Too bad that I still didn't see Peeves here. Thought I found him here. And the one who plays Tom Riddle is so cool. Full of hatred. The scene with the basilisk is so damn cool. So nerve-wrecking. And Gilderoy really brings the comedy to the movie. I'm so glad that the movie changes the person where in the book Harry Potter irritates Moaning Myrtle by saying that she couldn't get hurt because she's already dead. In the movie, Ron says that line. I think it's appropriate because Ron always be cynical.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
My favorite,"This is my second HP film I have ever watched and this perhaps my most favorite one. Talking about everything, it is completely referred to the first film since the director of the second film is the same as the first one.
First, as the actors grow up, their voices started to break especially for the Draco Malfoy, the actor Tom Felton did the brilliant job by portraying this character on the second film.
Second one is the CGI, comparing to the first one, the CG and animatronic in second film has greatly improved especially the Basilisk scene, the crew members did the great job by bring the robot snake to the action and it made almost all the audiences think it is real. And when portraying Donny, the CGI of the film is even greater than ever in that 2002 era.
Also, the film is also the longest one within all HP series and personally I like the long film because I can enjoy watching it on my bed when I was 14 and it felt pretty good.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Exciting,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the second novel in the Harry Potter series, written by J. K. Rowling. The plot follows Harry's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, during which a series of messages on the walls of the school's corridors warn that the ""Chamber of Secrets"" has been opened and that the ""heir of Slytherin"" would kill all pupils who do not come from all-magical families. These threats are found after attacks which leave residents of the school ""petrified"" (frozen like stone). Throughout the year, Harry and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger investigate the attacks.The book was published in the United Kingdom on 2 July 1998 by Bloomsbury and in the United States on 2 June 1999 by Scholastic Inc. Although Rowling found it difficult to finish the book, it won high praise and awards from critics, young readers and the book industry, although some critics thought the story was perhaps too frightening for younger children. Much like with other novels in the series, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets triggered religious debates; some religious authorities have condemned its use of magical themes, while others have praised its emphasis on self-sacrifice and on the way in which a person's character is the result of the person's choices.The film adaptation of the novel, released in 2002, became (at that time) the seventh highest grossing film ever and received generally favorable reviews. Video games loosely based on Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets were also released for several platforms, and most obtained favorable reviews.The film gives hints which are to be developed later, so we should watch the film carefully.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Follows the Source Material,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets follows the source material closer than than any other film adaptation of a novel that I have seen. While that is a huge positive for anyone eager to experience Hogwarts, it also makes for an overly long entry in the Harry Potter universe. Clocking in at 2h 41m, this is the longest movie in the franchise by a narrow margin (Goblet of Fire is 2h 37m).There are plenty of positive elements to Chamber of Secrets. The quidditch match is fantastic (best in the franchise?), the introduction to the Burrow is great and it's nice to see Harry finally perform a spell. As far as story arc goes, this movie showcases Hagrid in a special way, with the final scene of the movie bringing tears to my eyes.The plot does have a lot of moving parts, which might be confusing to the casual viewer. As I mentioned before, this movie follows the book almost line by line (except for the omitted deathday party). From ""following the spiders"" to polyjuice potion, there is a lot to digest.The story structure is fairly similar to the first film, which is often why the two movies feel one in the same. Of all the entries in the Harry Potter franchise, this is the one I find myself turning on the most often. Is it because it is the best movie? No. It is because it is a full Hogwarts experience and I find myself soaking in the ambiance.Best Character - HermioneBest Scene - Hagrid's Return.

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002):,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002):
The second Harry Potter film delves deeper into the mythology of the wizarding world, introducing new characters and expanding upon the magical lore. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson continue to impress in their roles as Harry, Ron, and Hermione, respectively, and Kenneth Branagh shines as the vain and pompous Gilderoy Lockhart.

While the film can be a bit darker and scarier than its predecessor, it's still a worthy addition to the franchise.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Improved, but still some questions","Harry Potter 2 is a definite improvement on its predecessor.  The writers and director have had the confidence to stray further from the text of the book, omitting more of the material which works well on the page but slowed the pace of the first movie to a crawl. They have also shown more judgement about the excisions, with none of the omissions from this movie being as vital as the lack of a sense of Harry's alienation in the first movie.However the child stars still alternate between ""wooden"" and ""ham"". Radcliffe (in the role of Harry) is particularly prone to the former and Grint (Ron Weasley) to the latter.With the voices of both boys breaking they are starting to seem a little older than the 12 year olds they are playing.While the pace is definitely better in this movie, I personally found that some of the set pieces were over-extended a little and the final wrap-up could definitely have been accelerated.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Entertaining,"So I guess the four Hogwarts houses are Gryffindor (the brave), Ravenclaw (the wise), Hufflepuff (the kind), and Slytherin (the Nazis)? While a bit over the top, it was a nice touch to add the elements of an aristocracy seeking racial purity in the second installment, for what could be more evil than that, and Jason Isaacs (Lucius Malfoy) and Tom Felton (Draco) were perfectly cast. I also liked seeing the beginnings of the mysterious link between Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort, and the story here is a good one.

"The 'Chamber' Is Nice, But No Big Secrets Inside","The second in the Harry Potter series was described as better than the first. I do not really agree with this. The 'Chamber' is a good movie, but there is no really anything new and the magic of the first film is already too well known and repeated here to be efficient. The only new funny character is the computerized servant, which I really expect to develop in the next series. Otherwise, the film is well done, well acted but too much the same. I really wonder if the young ones who are supposed to be a big percentage of the public can really enjoy the movie - some parts are too scary, and the 161 minutes are a challenge for young ages.However, do not miss it. This is certainly one series to follow, and hopefully the next one will have some more original stuff. 8/10 on my personal scale.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
An excellent sequel.,"This film is the adaptation of the second book in the Harry Potter's saga, written by J.K. Rowling. As in the first film, also this one was directed by Chris Columbus, keeping almost the same team and cast that worked in the first one. So, it's not surprising that Columbus has repeated here the success of the first movie of the franchise. It's also not surprising that there are obvious similarities between the two films, which ultimately distinguish them from the other films that would follow after Columbus departure. Another name that will disappear from the franchise after this film is Richard Harris, who played the role of Albus Dumbledore, one of the most important in the saga, as Harris dies that same year.

Director Chris Columbus uses the same techniques as his first film but this time the results appear clichÃ©d and stale. It does not have the same powerful impact it had the first time.

"Richer, Darker, and More Enchanting","Following the introduction in the first film, ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" dives deeper into the magical world, offering a darker and more thrilling adventure. With less explanation needed for the established magical elements, the film delves into a richer narrative brimming with new ideas and a growing sense of mystery.This sequel goes beyond a simple hero's journey. Instead, it focuses on the development of a diverse cast of characters, each with their own unique personalities and quirks. Harry, Ron, and Hermione return for their second year, facing challenges that even the experienced faculty appear to struggle with.The film's visual presentation is captivating. Hogwarts comes alive with its grand architecture, intricate details, and impressive special effects. The iconic Quidditch match is even more visually stunning, showcasing the vastness of the playing field and the dangers faced by the participants.New characters add flavor and intrigue to the story. Professor Sprout brings a touch of amusement with her herbology class, while Gilderoy Lockhart's conceited demeanor provides comedic relief. On the other hand, Lucius Malfoy embodies a sense of lurking menace.While the film's later sections feature action sequences that might be intense for younger audiences, they are presented with the excitement of a mainstream thriller, adding another layer of engagement to the narrative.Overall, ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" is a visually stunning and engaging film that builds upon the foundation laid in the first installment.

Kenneth Branagh's Lockhart is good value, as are the Malfoys, while Harry's snake charming and Myrtle the ladies' loo ghost provide some distraction from proceedings at the school. Also excellent is Dobby the CGI house elf, who manages to cause havoc just by trying to save Harry's life.Flying cars, numerous spiders, a plot against Hagrid, and the wisdom of Dumbledore (sadly the final appearance of Richard Harris in the role, who then died and was replaced by Michael Gambon) bring life at Hogwarts to life again, while moving on from introductions to bring a touch of menace into the drama.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Probably not, but I can't seem to resist.What Works: the general Harry Potter schtick is appealing and Rowling has constructed a well-thought out world. Everything looks good. Also I may have a crush on Emma Watson. I also like the name Tom Marvelo Riddle...would make a great post-punk band. To bad post-punk is dead. Long live klezmer!What Doesn't: Dobby is not nearly as bad as Jar-Jar Binks but its the same kind of character: he manages to simultaneously annoy and screw things up for the hero and the audience. Also Harry seems to lack a certain emotional death in this movie. He reminds me of a passenger in a car, just sort of doing his thing, not really concerned with what is going on...all the way up through the climactic final scene. He never seems to be truly phased or frightened and we don't either. This series needs to make things more difficult for Harry.

In fact the CG character of Dobby is very similar looking to Gollum in Lord of The Rings and the CG Asgard in television series Stargate SG-1 (speaking of textures) which which speaks well for Stargate SG-1 if it can do just as good as a top movie like this...and top it is. The CG Spiders were incredibly creepy and realistic looking. Not being too scared of Spiders, they kind of made me jump. I felt by body tense up as the gave case to Harry and Ron, which is a good thing because not often do I find myself doing this in movies. The person I had sat beside seemed pretty scared of the spiders as well.John Williams score was very much like his original score with old themes returning and some of the music sounding like music from his Indiana Jones scores. I found myself whistling the main theme of Harry Potter for most of the night and on occasion not realizing I was doing it until someone else pointed it out to me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Oh well, I guess I'm too old for this","I did sort of like the book, but remember that Professor Gilderoy Lockhart's character had some funny class scenes which were not in the movie. Slightly better than the first one, although Daniel Radcliffe still needs some serious acting lessons as he yet again manages to ruin too many scenes with his slow and cautious babbling. Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley manages to give the funniest scene in the entire movie as he manages to put a very unpleasant spell on himself. Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy looks hellishly evil and I look forward to seeing him in the fourth movie and Emma Watson is much less annoying in this second installment. But the movie is (again) overly long for what it has to tell, which is stupid since the main public are the children. Some nice scary spider moments, though. A movie where nothing is a coincidence, where everything you hear and learn will happen and where Harry Potter once again manages to look like a conceited and annoying knowitall. Should have seen in ten years ago. Wishful thinking.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Excellent!,"Christopher Columbus has once again brought Harry Potter to life through the magic of movies. Applause's to all! At 2 hours and 48 mins it might be a little long for young children. But for the rest time will fly from the time the movie starts til the credits role. Many times through the movie I couldn't help from thinking about the recent loss of Richard Harris (Albus Dumbledore). He truly was very fitting for the role and will be difficult to replace. Other than that I urge everyone to see ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"" it truly is magical to say the least.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Courage and Resourcefulness,"The Harry Potter film series is an interesting exception to the oft-quoted ""rule"" that sequels are never as good as the original films and that the more sequels a franchise spawns the worse they become. Most film sequels are ad hoc affairs; a film does well, so a team of scriptwriters are hired to cobble together another screenplay based around further adventures involving the same characters. The Potter series, however, is different; it is based upon a series of novels which were in themselves conceived not as isolated stories but as episodes in one greater story. It is, therefore, not surprising that the series has not succumbed to the sort of slapdash writing and money-grubbing cynicism which mark the later episodes of certain film franchises.""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" was the second instalment in the series and appeared in 2002, a year after the first, ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"". It follows the adventures of Harry and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger through their second year at Hogwarts School. The plot is too complex to set out here, but it revolves around a mysterious ""Chamber of Secrets"" which is said to exist somewhere within the school and to contain a monster. The Chamber can only be opened by the ""heir of Slytherin"" (one of the four wizards who founded the school), leading to much speculation as to who this might be. Memorable scenes in the film include Harry and Ron's journey to school by flying car and Harry's final confrontation with the basilisk.This is the first film in the series to explore one of J. K. Rowling's main themes in her novels, the conflict between those wizards, like the Malfoy family, who regard themselves as ""pure-born"" and those, known by the derogatory term ""mudblood"", who have some Muggle (i.e. non-magical) ancestry. (Rowling uses this conflict as an allegory for real-world racism). Mysterious messages appear proclaiming that the ""heir"" will kill all ""mudbloods"", and it is revealed that Hermione herself is a ""mudblood"".This was the last film of Richard Harris, who died not long after completing shooting and before it actually opened in the cinemas. Harris knew that he did not have long to live while making the film, and this is evident in his moving portrayal of the headmaster Albus Dumbledore, wise and benevolent but ageing and conscious of his fading powers. Kenneth Branagh makes his only appearance in a Potter film as the vain, self-obsessed celebrity wizard and best-selling author Gilderoy Lockhart who is appointed Professor of Defence against the Dark Arts; he perhaps represents Rowling's comment on modern celebrity culture. (Or perhaps on some of her fellow-authors). Other notable performances come from John Cleese as Nearly Headless Nick, one of the school's many ghosts, Jason Isaacs as the villainous Lucius Malfoy (father of Harry's enemy Draco) and Julie Walters as Ron's mother Molly. One character I could have done with less of was Dobby the House Elf, who with his irritatingly whiny voice threatened to become to the Potter series what Jar Jar Binks was to the ""Star Wars"" franchise.Another criticism I would have was that the film was perhaps too long; it was criticised for sticking too faithfully to the plot of Rowling's novel- an ironic criticism, given that some of the later films were criticised by Potter devotees for precisely the opposite reason. Nevertheless, this is overall an excellent film, and a worthy successor to ""Philosopher's Stone"". Both these films were directed by Chris Columbus, and they tend to be lighter in tone than many of the later episodes in the franchise. Despite this lightness in tone, however, Harry and his friends must frequently come face-to-face with danger, and as in any good adventure story the excitement and the satisfaction we derive from the film lies in seeing how they use their courage and resourcefulness to overcome the forces of evil. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Deeper and darker,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets takes us deeper into the magical world of Hogwarts and lets us explore more of its dark secrets.This is the last Harry Potter film directed by Chris Columbus and it still has that magical feeling, filled with wonder and imagination. But this is a much darker movie than the first one, digging deeper into the universe that J.J. Rowling so masterfully created. There's a very creepy atmosphere throughout this film and it certainly is, at times, even scary.Chamber does everything the first Harry Potter did well, and improves upon it. The special effects in this one don't look nearly as dated as the effects in Sorcerer's Stone, the CGI still holds up surprisingly well. The performances are even better than in the first film, which is I believe saying something. And although I gave them both 10/10, I do believe Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is superior to Sorcerer's Stone for the pace is faster, the characters and the universe are expanded and the effects are much better. Also, it has a much darker and more serious tone, and a sense of urgency throughout.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Still my favorite of the franchise,"Let me just get this out of the way, I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! I love a lot of the Harry Potter films, but not only is this one my favorite, it's in my top 3 favorite films. Sometimes it's number 1, but I always juggle it along with Jurassic Park and Empire Strikes Back. To put it simply, everything is right with this movie.Unlike the first film that made a failthful adabtation, but wasn't dark enough. COS gave us one of the best book to film adabtations, along with making it just as dark as the movies that followed. The acting is much better this time around, and the special effects are incredibly well done. Some may say they look dated, I don't think so, they look just as real to me now as back when I first saw it in 2002, (well OK, maybe that snake during Dueling club looked kind of cheap, but still.) The book isn't my favorite of the series, but the movie gets all the good stuff, while taking out a few things I don't like, such as that Valentines Day thing, and not wasting time when Hagrid is taken to Azkaban and going straight into the forrest. Although it would have been cool to see that Deathday party.Overall, it's not the best movie of all time, but I still Love it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Harry and co get a little darker,"Rating-7/10Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the second of the Harry Potter film franchise and again directed by Christopher Columbus. Now the film is the kind of movie that feels like it is made for kids but in truth, is very entertaining for all. I liked the film, and even though I have seen this many many times, I still thoroughly enjoyed the plot and given the massive running time, it is hard to enjoy a movie that is this long after so many viewings.Now the plot is different from the first movie, it is much darker, much more sinister and could be said to be ever so slightly more violent. Now it isn't so much a scary film, but some kids may not like it so much in areas and very little one's could be frightened so heads up. But anyway back to the plot and it's interesting, yet again mysterious and if you have never seen this before, it is one hell of a ride.The young characters of Harry, Ron and Hermione come back same as ever, although I did feel this movie explores them a bit more and establishes there personalities even more so than the first. Richard Harris is pretty memorable as Dumbledore, he just becomes the most majestic of all actors here and any scene with him in is engaging and thoughtful at times. Steve Kloves who adapts the books for the big screen for me is one person to mention, he makes the film exciting and although still faithful, adds bits here and there to make it more exciting.Now Columbus directs this in a way that makes it still faithful to the written material, but brings it into a new cinematic era of fantasy movies and this makes it different from others. Columbus also works well with the actors too, all the cast seem to work well and despite the odd parts of bad acting(to be fair they are young) Columbus uses a steady hand. With the writing and directing comes the absolutely wonderful and beautiful score by John Williams who yet again smashes it and creates some of the best work of his career.One thing that makes this a step forward in the film series is the humour, now the first movie is pretty funny but this really gets it right and the script is mixed well with drama and comedy. Kenneth Branagh is a great addition as Professor Gilderoy Lockhart who is as vain as he is stupid, and also one of the funniest but kind of silliest things about this movie. Some of the one two's between Branagh and not only Radcliffe, but also Alan Rickman etc, are just fantastic.I felt the main negatives I see in this are that it is too long, there isn't really a lot wrong with this but the length can really drag this out and although this movie has substance throughout, the repetitive tone can get a little dull. I think of the biggest improvements on the other hand are the special effects which show that not only having a massive budget can help, but also that the film series is so big it can now get that kind of fantastic work done on it.Overall I felt it to be a good movie and very little has changed in my mind since seeing it last. It is the kind of movie though where you can just see it over and over and still not get too bored, just great fun for all the family and probably the last Harry Potter movie that contains that really sweet feeling the youngsters create.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Bloated and Americanised adaptation,"Director Chris Columbus, responsible for popular cuddly, family-friendly movies such as Home Alone (1990) and Mrs. Doubtfire (1993), here makes his second, and thankfully last, entry into the Harry Potter franchise. The series needed to go way darker after Chamber of Secrets, and did, and this film marked the ending of the bright, and non-threatening, adventures for Harry and co. It's also the last time Potter the film so painstakingly stuck to Harry the book, and here everything that should have been cut in fact remains. Due to this, and the exhausting running time, Chamber of Secrets is the worst of all 8 films.Still stuck with his horrible adoptive parents (Richard Griffiths and Fiona Shaw) for the summer while he awaits another year at his beloved Hogwarts, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is visited by house-elf Dobby (voiced by Toby Jones), who warns him that he must not return to the school of wizardry this year. He finds his efforts to catch the Hogwarts Express scuppered, and instead must travel by flying car with his daft friend Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint). When he does arrive, students begin to turn up petrified (literally), with whispers of the mythical Chamber of Secrets being re-opened and unleashing a terrifying monster into the school.While the first film needed to spend time on developing the world that J.K. Rowling so beautifully imagined and the colourful characters who inhabit it, Chamber of Secrets has no such baggage. Yet Columbus, along with screenwriter Steve Kloves, have done little other than simply film the images millions of fans already have imprinted in their mind. We seem to slog through every second of Harry's second year at Hogwarts, with little thought having been given to the humour and charm that seemed to spatter every paragraph in the engrossing novels.Instead, we get special-effects aplenty, with long periods dedicated to a flying car with a mind of it's own, some hungry spiders in the forest, and a Quidditch match that does little that the first film didn't do already. Rowling's books are so recognisably British, with old eccentrics who all seem to have Monty Python-silly senses of humour, and that feeling of the characters all sitting near a comforting roaring fire. Even though Columbus have upheld Rowling's demand for an all- British cast, everything in the film seems fat and Americanised, all CGI and no heart, so far removed from Britain that I almost expected Steve Martin or Robin Williams to walk in.There are a few saving graces, namely the stellar cast of adults, all returning from the first film. It also introduces Kenneth Branagh as celebrity wizard and new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher Gilderoy Lockhart, and Jason Isaacs as the father of Harry's arch-nemesis Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton). They chew on their scenes, helping save the still- struggling Radcliffe and Emma Watson (who would get better as the films progressed). It also marked the sad passing of Richard Harris, here appearing for the final time as Dumbeldore, before being replaced by Michael Gambon in the role. But a few decent performances cannot save this bloated, sickly film from feeling stretched and an hour too long.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
More a watchable then the first one,I really enjoyed the first Harry Potter but even theore it was a bit scary and a bit too long but I found this one a lot more better then the first one. It was Dark at times but still enjoyable to watch I loved the flying car I think it's great car such shame it did not appear in the last film which would of been. The spiders are scary but I can under stand they are just CGI puppets. Ron was pretty funny at times which I like about his character I think they put more effort into his character then they did in the first one.Great movie much better then the first one worth watching if you are in the mood 10/10,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Definitely the movie for Harry fans.,"It was November 14, 2002.And there I stood, eagerly awaiting one of the most anticipated film of the year. I checked my watch - still only 11:54! Only six minutes, I kept telling myself. Six minutes, and I'd be in. Six minutes, and it would be November 15 - the day that I had been waiting for since early that summer. For as I held my breath alongside my friends and fellow fans, I couldn't help but keep thinking: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was being made into a film!Within a few minutes I was hooked. While Uncle Vernon yelled at Harry, and Dobby forewarned him about the following year, the plot unravelled and the audience held its breath. The hours dragged on, but ""dragged"" really isn't the best word to describe it. . .I was held on the edge of my seat. Simply sitting there, watching the movie (sipping a Coke), I couldn't contain my enthusiasm. Well, actually, I could, so I sat through the rest of it with a grin upon my face.

"Inherently Rich and Endearing, Harry's Second Romp Doesn't Really Go Anywhere New","Harry and friends return for a second term, where they're quickly caught up in a long-standing plot to rid the school of so-called ""impure"" students. Between the celebrated, absurdly deep cast, the charming, nuanced world at large and the constant manipulations of a shadow-clad foil, this picture had an awful lot going for it right out of the gates... so why does it feel like we're just treading water? A large swath of The Chamber of Secrets seems inessential and redundant, which isn't to say it's without merit, just that it could be using this time to fry much larger fish. Did we need to reinforce the idea that Harry's adoptive parents are cruel people? Didn't our hero avoid an attempt on his life on the Quidditch pitch last time around? For that matter, wasn't the entire endgame eerily similar in the preceding installment? Too much time smelling the roses when there's a fire down the block.Of course, it's not all bad news. The CGI, though still not without the occasional hiccup, has vastly improved since the last picture. That doesn't excuse the force-fed inclusion of an all-digital supporting character, but at least these appearances are kept mercifully short and to-the-point. Although it's the longest installment in the Harry Potter franchise, this chapter skims along at a strict pace and feels much shorter than it actually is. Though seemingly inconsequential as a whole, the plot does drop frequent hints at a darker side of the Hogwarts mythos before, ultimately, allowing such things to continue lurking in obscurity. It shows promise in spades, and will certainly capture the hearts and minds of the younger audiences it's primarily there for, but more demanding viewers will likely find it too thin and sugary for serious digestion.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"A extrodinary adventure through a mystical legend, that will entrall you to laugh, and journey into your deepest fears","Christoper Columbus' Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, is a far cry from the preceding Harry Potter movie. For this time, a more fearful mystrey awaits the willing youngsters from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Columbus' witty ideas, the musical score, and the realistic-like visual effects brings true magic to the screen. Also the acting has taken a sharp turn from Sorcere's Stone, the players have grown and taken these films to a more proffesional level.Even John Williams' musical score will keep you in complete suspense as you sit on the edge of your seat. Although the new movie has a more frightening touch it has the audience anxiously waiting to gasp and gaze at the impressive dramatics of the big screen. With a new approach to the special effects, the movie franchise has introduced a greater excitement in scenes such as the Quidditch game, Aragog's lair, and The Chamber of Secrets. Chris Columbus takes a new perspective on the movie, as he draws away from JK Rowling's literary works. Subtle changes have been made in the movie and have finally created a comfortable enviorment for the wizarding world. The new action sequenes may be quite scary to children below the age of seven, but the tasteful violence will enthrall young audiences as for older ones too. The transition from the first to second movie is smooth,not like a choppy pass on such as The Mummy Returns. This masterpiece deserves much praise for the hard work for the cast and crew, yet there are times when there is not enough background information for one to fully understand the Potter history. This movie will take anyone to hights in the Weasley's flying Ford Angila, and take one to the spooky depths of salazar's chamber. Harry Potter fans will leave not disappointed to the least bit, and ordinary muggles will return with a drop of magical blood in them, for they have been to Hogwarts... and back.

"A dark, tense & mysterious superior sequel","While Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was more of a set up of its great world and many colorful characters, the Chambers of Secrets manages to expand further on its world with a more serious approach. The film is darker in tone and theme & its tension far outweighs the original.Visually the film is not as much obsessed with capturing this great fantasy universe that Harry Potter is set in, as much of that was already done wonderfully in the original film. Instead, Chamber of Secrets focuses on creating a fascinating mystery, which admittedly the first one also was, but the narrative structure in Chamber of Secrets is a bit more complex, with a lot of past events taken into account. I cannot stress enough how important John Williams's score is for these series, as they always seem to embody the feel the audience gets when watching it. In the Sorcerer's stone, we had a lot of joyous and adventurous themes, but in Chamber of Secrets most of the times quite an onimous and mysterious theme is used, which is also brilliantly composed by Williams as the music seems to tell a story in itself. Look at the scene where the chamber is finally opened for example. This scene is extremely memorable mostly due to Williams's fantastic orchestral score which captures the essence of the discovery perfectly.Normally i'm not a big fan of adding new characters to an existing new franchise as this, but Lucius Malfoy ( Jason Isaacs ) with the arrogant like back tilting of his head is very impressive as he embodies the over confidence of his character perfectly, & Gilderoy Lockhart ( Kenneth Branagh ) who is a great addition of a character that seems to have an ego that far exceeds his capabilities. Furthermore, the brilliant performances of Alan Rickman ( Snape ), Richard Harris ( Dumbledore ) & Maggie Smith ( Professor McGonagall ) return and have not diminished in the sequel. The three main leads Daniel Radcliffe ( Harry Potter ), Rupert Grint ( Ron Weasley ) & Emma Watson ( Hermione Granger ) are also admittedly growing in acting prowess although it is still the case the adults mostly steal the show with their acting at this point.It still does not deal directly with death as a theme, as its victims are petrified instead of killed by an unknown assailant, but this in turn creates a more mysterious feel to the film as we know everybody has the power to kill, but do not quite understand who has the power to petrify, which leads to the audience becoming fascinated in its mystery and the solving of it. It is not that the film gives the audience a clear view that the 'good guys' cannot be touched, since a real threat seems to be around every corner. The sheer teamwork between the tree main leads into solving this mystery and their great use of eachothers strengths and weaknesses furthermore enhances the emotional connection we have with them, and the final scene in which they are re-united with a certain friendly character is truly one of cinema's warmest moments, as it provides an over emotion of joy since our bonds with the characters have become so close over the first two films.The true star is its complex narrative structure, since its mystery is always evolving until the conclusion will leave you with emotions of self discovery and joy, as if we were really there in the moment due to the fact that the camaraderie between the characters seems to genuine.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Not much of a story.,"The book ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" doesn't have much of a story, but in the movie, even less can be found of it.

A triumph of marketing over filmmaking!,"It never ceases to amaze me how Hollywood can spend millions of dollars to make a beautiful, sweeping piece of film and have it still turn out to be garbage. The first Harry Potter film, while not award-winning cinema, was at least somewhat amusing. The second installment, however, was simply a mess.First, the good points: the character Ron was consistently fun to watch, particularly in the spider's lair. The actress that plays Hermione is adorable (though her character is an annoying know-it-all), and may grow up to be a good actress if she can avoid being stereotyped. The sets were charming and often interesting.Now, the bad: it's rare that one gets the opportunity to watch computer-generated characters overact, and rarer still that CG over-actors can outdo Kenneth Branagh, but here that's exactly what happens. There's an episode of ""Third Rock From The Sun"" where Dick Solomon plays a grotesquely over-acting ham in a high-school performance of 'Romeo and Juliet'; the scenes with CG characters, particularly the death of the basilisk, reminded me of nothing so much as that.Speaking of Kenneth Branagh: are things truly so bad for him that he has to take scripts like this and 'Wild Wild West'? A brilliant Shakespearean actor, his talents are utterly wasted on this tripe. The same goes for Richard Harris and the other excellent adult actors in this film. The child actors can perhaps be excused for any ill-made script choices in their careers; actors who are something of elder statesmen can be expected to make wiser decisions.The plot, such as it is, is simply a mess. Harry lives with his uncle and aunt, who are grossly abusive (and who would be imprisoned for child abuse in the real world); yet Harry, who for reasons not entirely clear is apparently the second coming of the wizardly Christ, not only tolerates their ridiculous behavior, but accepts it as if he has no backbone whatsoever. Things get no better once he goes to Hogswarts, the land where magic infuses everything with no rhyme or reason and incantations are used when it would be easier to do something by hand.And there lies my major complaint with the Harry Potter franchise: there is no logic behind the magic in the story. Pictures of people are alive; stairways reconfigure themselves at will; ghosts are people who just happen to be dead yet act (and are treated) as if they were still alive...there is a huge amount of random magic, but no explanation as to why things should be like this. Are the wizards inherently magical, and simply in need to training to control their powers, or is magic something anyone can learn? If the former, then how to characters like Hermione (whose parents are both ""muggles""; that is, normal people) able to perform magic? The muggles generally seem to be aware of the existence of the wizards and the school; yet at one point Harry and Ron get in trouble for allowing seven muggles t o see their flying car (which, in two other unexplained moments, shows a surprising amount of intelligence, acting as a deus ex machina for no apparent reason beyond plot contrivance). Also, Harry is something of a celebrity: everyone knows him and is pleased to meet him. Yet his skills and personality are such that anyone in their right mind would be less than impressed once they'd gotten past the glamour of his reputation. Of course, when the adults in the film are ready to throw in the towel because they can't figure out the simplest of problems (thus leaving it to the know-it-all Hermione, the charming yet useless Ron, and the fumbling, worthless, personality-free Harry) one is perhaps not surprised.Two final notes: Draco Malfoy and his father Lucius (the bad guys--we know they're evil because their hair is greased back; thank you Quentin Tarantino for that enduring signal) are utterly one-dimensional; evil merely because the script says they are...not because of any actions or behavior on their parts. If there were a reason for the snotty scowl constantly on Draco's face, it might be tolerable; as it is, combined with his ignorant, selfish behavior, any reasonable school administration would spend a great deal of time either counseling or punishing him. And the grossly cutesy names and words are kind of fun at first: 'muggles' for normal people; 'Dumbledore', 'Slytherin', etc; but after a short while, they become contrived, ridiculous, and annoying...particularly when the main character's names are ""Harry"", ""Ron"", and ""Hermione"".And would somebody PLEASE tell the actor playing Harry that a smile is more than just showing your teeth?! Sheesh.3 stars out of ten, mostly for the scenery. This movie is to the elementary school crowd what Pokemon is to the kindergarten crowd: a way for adults to avoid spending quality time with their kids.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Has it only been a year?,"The first movie had the task of introducing all the characters, sets and get through the plot.  It worked brilliantly.  The second episode finds the kids' voices an octave lower, and their stature 6 inches taller.  Since the characters were mostly introduced in the first episode, these two hours had to be filled with plot.  Other than a couple of slow spots filled with silence it did pretty well.  Rupert Grint in particular had an opportunity to show off every possible expression and emotion;  he reminded me of Will Smith in MIB with his depiction of stark terror, disgust (slugs), nausea, stark terror and combinations of the above. Suggest Peter O'Toole for Dumbledore; as the character assumes more importance in Episode 3 and 4. Slower and darker, it still worked.  8/10",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A Sequel That Stands to the Original,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets raises the adrenaline factor for fans. This sequel follows Harry as he faces new evils emerging at Hogwarts. The plot is full of twists, stakes, and wizardly charm. The flow of the story is well-paced, and I never felt bored during the film. The theme once again revolves around questioning the environment and trusting your friends. The characters are well-fleshed out and closely resemble the books, and the acting is spectacular, considering the age of many of these actors/actresses. The dialogue has many hidden meanings and easter eggs scattered throughout; there is always something the audience can pick up the second time around watching the film. The scenes were again on-point and expanded from the last film, not making the audience feel bored in the same place. The soundtrack and background music were used more heavily in this film than in the first; however, the music added to key scenes and never took away from the moment.

Second instalment works out well too.,"Prejudice starts to become the dominant theme in the second of the Potter series and it certainly does. Who is a pure blood, half-blood, or just Muggle-born? Coincidentally, Ron, Harry and Hermione come under each category respectively.Our three friends have returned for this second instalment of the popular series only to find themselves in their second year, that something really bad is going to happen in the school they all attend. With even this time Ron's youngest sister Ginny (Bonnie Wright) able to attend Hogwarts now, and even a maybe over-zealous Harry fan in the form of Ginny's classmate Colin Creevey (Hugh Mitchell), things are getting more complicated.Harry realised he can actually speak snake language, something only the descendants of one of Hogwarts' founders, Slytherin, can only achieve. Soon all the accusations that he is the Slyerin's heir (given he is in Gryffindor actually) started to come out. But his two friends and those who believed he is not the Slyterin's heir all stood by him.Things only get worse when students in the school are getting Petrified, and Hermione is one of them. Soon, Harry and Ron found out all the reasons behind all the sinister actions that has been going on in the school. And it's all up to Harry to save the day.Finally one can know how the young Tom Riddle (aka Lord Voldermort) looks like, from his memory. As he said that to Harry when they were in the Chamber of Secrets. Well, those who are aware of the instalment will know what happened in the end.Saw this on DVD as well actually and it once aired on the television here like days after the fourth movie came out in the cinemas.

The books are a work of art, but the movies aren't a letdown either. Definitely deserve better ratings. The characters are well portrayed, everyone acted well. Quite impressive for early teenagers Harry, Ron and Hermione.

A great improvement by Columbus,"Like I said in my review of the Sorcerer's Stone, this film is a definite improvement by director Christopher Columbus from the first one. I think Chris was more comfortable and took more chances with this one. One thing that I couldn't help, but notice was how the cinematography changed. In the first film the color of the film is golden and bright, while in this one is a darker color and the brightness has been considerably diluted. Columbus said in a documentary about the making of this movie that the cinematography here was darker, because it suited the feel and environment of the story much better. In the first one everything is bright because we are getting to see Hogwarts for the first time, and it helps the audience fall in love with the school just like Harry. While in the second one we are already comfortable with the surroundings so things get darker because we see a darker side of Hogwarts that we didn't see in the first one. Again great acting by Radcliffe, Grint and Watson. And some great performances by newcomers Kenneth Branagh, Jason Isaacs, Christian Coulson and Bonnie Wright. This is a great movie for kids and families, and a great addition to the HP franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
You gotta watch this movie!!!,"I believe Chamber of Secrets the Movie is a little better than Sorcerer's Stone.

"good, but not as good as the first one","I have not read the book to the ""Chamber of Secrets"", only watched the movie on TV recently.  The special effects were really great, but the story line was a bit disappointing.  The story was altogether a bit too similar to the first movie, but it somehow lacked its charm.  The ending was a bit too rushed for a movie of this length and some of the final scenes looked a bit awkward and forced.  I also did not quite understand the purpose of the spiders, but maybe that's just me and it might become clearer if I read the book one day.  I sincerely resented the character Dobby, it was too reminiscing of some annoying CGI-character from ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace"".Having said that, the movie was certainly funnier and at the same time somewhat 'darker' than the first one, which were certainly refreshing new aspects.  The acting by the cast (Harry, Ron, Hermione, Dumbledore, McGona..?, Snape, Malfoy I+II, and many others) was really great.I am looking forward to the next sequels to come, and I seriously hope they will not be a repetition of the same story pattern over and over again.

"The real first movie, in many ways","The Chamber Of Secrets is significantly better with each viewing. The film greatly improves upon the first installment's flaws, which those who read my first review will remember I said had too minor a focus on the main plot of the Stone and more focus on the world-building and exposition. This film's main narrative of the Chamber being opened again is much more present, Steven Klove finally finding a perfect balance between the bits of them interacting with the Wizarding World, and the bits of the main driving narrative.Not only is the main narrative strongly written with great dialogue and a real sense of unraveling to an ultimate moment and climax, but its actually far more interesting when you view it again after seeing the later films and know the hidden information of the good guys' and bad guys' secrets. All of the plot threads that will last through the series are brilliantly put in place here so subtly but without distracting from the central narrative, such as the real reason Snape is so hard on Harry and Ron's poverty and Voldemort's prejudice against Muggle-Borns and the secret to his survival, etc. Heck, even the word Expelliarmus isn't said until this movie! In a way, since the essential tropes and aesthetic for the whole series aren't put in place until this installment, this almost feels like the real first film!This film has aged very well, and I can honestly say that it gets miles better with each viewing. The secrets to this franchises' success have finally been opened!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

The Second Film is a Bit Darker But Just As Fun,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002)*** (out of 4)Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is warned that he must never go back to Hogwarts but he's determined to see his friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson). It doesn't take long after being back that Harry realizes that there are some dark forces at play.HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS is a good film that manages to have all the strengths as the first film. As with the first movie, this one here is quite strong in regards to its technical achievements. Once again the CGI is quite good and this here is coming from someone who usually doesn't like it. So many movies use CGI so poorly that it takes the viewer out of the story but that doesn't happen here. Instead the CGI perfectly creates this world of magic and it really comes across perfectly.As I said in my first review, I'm not familiar with the books so I'm pretty much viewing these films blind so I can't compare them to the books or know how much justice this does the book. I think the best thing the film has going for it are the young cast members who are wonderful in their parts. Radcliffe is really believable in the role of the brilliant wizard and I think as the subject got darker here the actor managed to raise his performance level. Watson and Grint aren't as heavily used here but they too are good. Kenneth Branagh joins the cast and delivers some fresh fun. Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman and Richard Harris are all on hand and delivering fine work as well.I must admit that once again the biggest issue I had with this second film is the rather extremely long running time. Clocking in at 160 minutes the film does manage to move at a nice pace and the magic and excitement are still on hand but at the same time I can't see why the film needed to run this long.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Pretty good,"I loved the first movie, and thought that there was no way it could be improved on - but how wrong I was.It was brilliant, and a great portrayal of the book. Chris Columbus is a brilliant director, and it's a shame he didn't direct Prisoner Of Azkaban.Emma Watson, Rupert Grint and Daniel Radcliffe's acting just gets better and better, and I can't imagine anyone else playing Harry, Ron, and Hermione, because it just wouldn't work. And Kenneth Branagh is SO funny, he's a definite highlight. I think the lack of Sean Biggerstaff wasn't good though, because he's a brilliant actor, and Wood appears in the book a lot more than he appeared in the movie.I think the way Dobby was made to seem was a bit weedy though....He's supposed to be, but I don't think the design of him was very good, and I don't want to see what house elves in the other movies will look like if this is anything to go by.Overall, I liked everything, except the scenes in the forest - but that's just my arachnophobia.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Sequel lacked charm of the original,"I waited until reading book two before commenting on the movie. Unfortunately, I did not enjoy the second as well as the first in either the book or the movie. I guess I can't blame the director, based on the book with which he had to work. The Chamber of Secrets was a good movie, it just lacked the joy and delight of the first. I prefer fantasy movies to be fun. The characters were fleshed out quite a bit more, but that is to be expected when they are seen the second time around. There is no way the topic should be treated as anything but fun, it's young magicians after-all. I suspect the books and movies that follow will be darker and more serious, therefore less enjoyable to me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Not to be missed!,"Some will argue that the first film was better. More will argue that this, the second outing of J.K.Rowling's immensely popular novels was better.Whatever your view, few can deny that the Chamber of Secrets was every bit as impressive (technically) as the first film.In this second outing, we see Harry, Ron and Hermione starting their second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Unbeknown to them, it will be every bit of an adventure as their first year.This year, Harry starts to hear threatening voices, and walls whispering menacingly to him. To make matters worse, it seems only he can hear them! Even more puzzlingly, why are students being turned to stone and why is everyone blaming Harry?A secret diary, and an even more secret chamber may just hold the answers.This second film is terrific - pure comedy from start to finish that will appeal to all ages. There are a dazzling assortment of special effects, and superb performances from the three young start (particularly Grint). A film not to be missed, and not just for Harry Potter fans. This is excellent family entertainment, and if you didn't manage to catch it at the cinema, then I strongly recommend you go and buy it on video/DVD.*****/*****Claire Belcher, Enfield",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A Little Darker Than the First,"After really being charmed by the first film, I now begin to see more of the darkness and seriousness of these movies. I read and enjoyed the first book, but haven't got the wherewithal to continue to read them. I've decided to rely on the movies. This one takes us to a new level with interesting new characters and, especially, villains. Those who were exposed in the first movie are now developed and a part of the pattern Harry and his pals share. Hogwarts and environs becomes even more amazing and puzzling. The long shots, especially, are so very creative. We find out as each movie comes along that Harry is fallible and must face his fears without much help. This leads to a real empathy with him. There are so many superheroes frequenting the movies these days. Many are pretty tiresome. Their stories lack character. Harry, of course, is a wizard, but he is always becoming. Not being a Potterfile, I am going to have to remain a charmed observer. I think this is a wonderful series and look forward to seeing them all.After encountering the ever threatening Voldemort, Harry now has a new task. Somewhere in the past the Slitherins, influenced by an evil wizard, kept a monster in a secret place. The purpose of his being there was at some point to decimate the school, sending all non ""pureblood"" students packing (or even killing them). Harry and his friends must find out what happened back then and move to find the person whose destiny it is to release the monster. There are some great scenes her, beginning with Harry being picked up by the Weasley boys and being brought to Hogwarts in a most dangerous manner. Malfoy and his father become bigger threats than they were in the first film and lay the groundwork for a future confrontation. Hagred is sent off to prison for a time, falsely accused, and Dumbledore comes under suspicion. The episode ends in an incredibly clever way, setting the stage for more uncovering of Harry's role in what is thrust upon him.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

The truth here Tom Redll looks too romaticized, than in the latest books and movies of the saga. The 2nd part very much of a campaign on the first, it is the last ""children's"" part. The only thing that it became much better - dynamics of successions of events has considerably accelerated. The first part nevertheless was too linear and short (I mean only the movie), and the introduction tightened. In general, the second part has successfully developed the ideas of the original, we can say it is a successful sequel in everything.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

An exceptional film,"I have seen ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of secrets"" dozens and dozens of times and my opinion has not changed.  It is an exceptional film, with an amazing cast, and extrodinary special effects.  The movie starts out with Harry Potter living back at Privet Drive for the summer until school is back in session.  Harry recieves warnings from a house elf named Dobby saying that ""Harry Potter must not go back to school!""  But Harry ignores the warnings and returns to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and wizardry (the magical school that has become more like a home, in which Harry has friends to be his family).  After he returns is when the real adventure begins! Something evil has returned to the school and the students are being petrified!  In the end, Harry prooves that he's more than a wizard, he's a herro! Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) has grown a lot since the first film and his work has improoved greatly.  His acting abilities really stand out and I couldn't help but to put all of my attention on him.  I can seriously say that the movies would not be the same without him... and definately not as good.  He was the star, and for me, the true enjoyment of the whole film.I would definately recommend this movie to anyone who loves action, adventure, and magic all wrapped up into one!",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Pretty much flawless,"Some of the gripes I had about the first part, are still to be found, but they are very weakened. The children act way better now. Special effects have been improved.

I am really happy that the Harry Potter movies went into that direction.The sequel is better than the part before. Maybe this is what shows, that this ""series of movies"" is actually good. Just as it has been with for example Star Wars. The first movie that has been created, is not yet as good as the two following parts. (I am talking about the old Star was movies from the 80's here.) Maybe that is a sing, that the Harry Potter movies will become classics as well? Maybe it will need time for people to realize how great this movies actually are. I personally have to say, that I found the movies better the 2nd time I watched them. There is so much to discover - so much creativity, beauty and fun.

"A strong sequel, but elements get lost in transition from book to film...","Chamber of Secrets is the sequel to the widely received Philospher's Stone and a marked improvement over it's prequel in terms of plot and character depth and acting skill by the film's young actors. A lot of this is down to the fact that the book itself is very well written though sadly some elements of it aren't portrayed quite as well in the film.Like Philosopher's Stone, the line-up is strong, with many well-known names here in the UK (Robbie Coltraine, Alan Rickman to name a couple) that gives this film an air of greatness, and even the film's young stars - Daniel Radcliffe (Harry), Rupert Grint (Ron) and Emma Watson (Hermione) exude far greater confidence in their roles this time around and appear to be more at home with their surroundings. Some of this is down to better scripting, some to better acting ability (or training) but a lot of it is simply down to the actors returning to familiar territory.Many book-to-film transfers usually end up omitting large parts of the plot, or lend themselves to grandiose special effects designed to prop up a weak, or butchered plot. Chamber of Secrets manages not to fall into either trap, although sacrifices were made to the plot to keep everything together in a short time frame.For instance, seasons pass incredibly quickly in the film. So quickly, in fact that if you blinked, you've probably just skipped a couple of months. This isn't an exaggeration: The book manages to cover several main festivals and holidays that the film simply omits - i.e. Halloween. Moaning Myrtle is introduced in the film for the first time in a girls' toilet. In the book, she is actually introduced to Harry, Ron and Hermione during a Deathday Party hosted by Nearly-Headless Nick on Halloween. Incidentally, the girls toilets are 'out of order' in the book.Another change between book and film is the introduction of the wizardry version of racism. Although it was a theme touched upon in the first book, here it is the main undercurrent and sits well at home with Harry's arch-nemesis, Draco Malfoy. He almost looks like an advert for the Hitler Youth in the film, and the comments about ""Mudbloods"" - a phrase to describe, in derogatory terms a witch or wizard born from non-magical parents, certainly sit at home with his appearance... Had it been explored further. In the film however, it seems to be reserved for just a couple of scenes, and one of those - the scene following Malfoy's verbal assault on Hermione in the schoolyard, had been re-written so that it seemed Hermione herself took personal offence (being almost reduced to tears), rather than Ron and Harry (and just about everyone else on the Gryffindor Quidditch team).A few new characters are introduced into the film too, including Ron's sister Ginny, and my personal favourite, Dobby - a house elf, not too dissimilar in appearance to Gollum from Lord of the Rings. He became my personal favourite character simply because of the way he's in constant conflict with himself - ironing his hands or smashing his head against a wall when he lets secrets slip. He provides a lot of laughs in the short time he appears in the film.An ominous new character is Lucius Malfoy, Draco's father and a holder of many dark secrets, some exposed in the film, but many more left behind in the book. In the book, he shares the same ""racist"" attitude as his son Draco, but is more aware of who he can share this view with, and when it's best to keep his mouth closed. Again, only a part of this is carried into the film. It's not essential, but it certainly adds an extremely dark element to the Harry Potter universe.Finally, there is Gilderoy Lockhart, an opportunistic fraud whose character carries extremely well from book to the big screen. In the book, Hermione (along with all the other girls) is besotted with him, whilst Harry and Ron quickly see through his paper-thin veneer. This, sadly isn't apparent in the film, which is a shame because it provides for many hilarious moments when he's running scared, with Ron and Harry seeing him for what he is, but Hermione, with having a massive crush on him, seeing something completely different - Bravery, when he was incapable of showing it! One thing that becomes apparent is that Hogwarts seems to go through a lot of Defence Against The Dark Arts teachers...As a standalone film, it fares pretty well. The characters are strong, and the acting somewhat more believable this time around. The humour's there, and the Harry Potter universe is faithfully recreated, but darker elements have been watered down, possibly to make the film more accessible to children (though it's a children's book in the first place?), or possibly because it was felt that certain elements just weren't needed.I feel that if you have read the book first, you will be disappointed with the big screen equivalent. I discovered that although I read the book long after seeing the film, it wasn't difficult to see what had been omitted, and I would've felt disappointed with the end result had I know beforehand. But I didn't, and as a standalone film, it's very good.What does become apparent however, is that as the books continue to grow bigger and bigger, a lot more sacrifices will have to be made in future to try and squeeze a 700-page book (like Half Blood Prince) down to a three-hour film, and I wouldn't envy the person who ends up with the task of doing it! Apparently, Goblet of Fire makes some major omissions (I've not seen it, or read the book yet to draw a comparison, but the book is only a fraction of the size of Half Blood Prince, though it is double that of Chamber of Secrets.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

HP2,"Continuing my revisit of this series and wow does it get off to a rough start. The first movie might not have struck a chord with me but it was still and positive experience in the end. Film 2 and I'm feeling fully 'meh' on it. It happened and while I can't say it hurts the overall experience of the series, I don't particularly think it helps either. We get more world building, more characters and more crazy witchcraft. Problem here is that the primary character introduced is supremely annoying. Branagh is better than Lockhart and this whole performance/character is just obnoxious and one dimensional. From the first second he steps on screen you know what his deal is. We get more danger for our intrepid trio and yet it is becoming painfully apparent that they're not actually in any danger. They survived the first film and it doesn't feel like anything thrown at them here will have any lasting impact. We also get Dobby and honestly I'm not particularly bothered by him simply because he's in the film so minimally.Chamber of Secrets is a very underwhelming film and given that the first wasn't exactly a knockout makes me completely understand anyone that walked away from it. It still doesn't feel like it's found it's footing or knows where it wants to go or even what it wants to be. The mixture of childishness and gravitas is still off and the whole thing feels unsatisfying. But that's just it. It's not bad, persay, it's just not particularly good.

Jason Isaacs was deliciously, patricianly evil as Lucius Malfoy...even though his fistfight with Arthur Weasly, one of the book's highlights, was oddly missing. The kids were decent-- Tom Felton as Draco sneers just as well as his fictional Head of House, and Emma Watson makes a passable, but too PRETTY Hermione. Ginny Weasley was blink-and-you'll-miss-her, odd, considering the pivotal natue of her role. Rupert Grint...eh. He's likable enough. Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore? I find his portrayal to be a little lifeless-- and I swear, there is no pun intended.

Who says sequals are never as good as the original??,"When I saw ""Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone"", I was very impressed. I thought it was awsome and I saw it numerous times in the theater.  When I went to see ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"", I was wondering if it was going to be as good.If any of you havn't seen this movie yet and you liked the first one, you won't be dissapointed.  This is just as good, if not better, than the first. Just like the first, it was pretty faithful to the book (it can't be exact because then it would be 4 hours long, which I wouldn't mind).  Infact, it was probably more faithful.  The special effects are awsome and of course, the quidditch (spelling?) is the best part of the movie.  Yes, it is darker and a little scarier than the first (especially if you have archnophobia), but Ron (Rupert Grint) always comes through with the best lines.  And the actor who played professor Lockhart (can't remember the name at the moment) was brilliant.  Nobody could have played him better.To sum it all up, the acting was good (you could tell that the kids had improved from the first movie), the story was good, it was funny and a little scary (the spiders are freaky in this movie), but in the end, this has got to be one of the best movies i've ever seen.

A good sequel to the franchise,"""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" was once again directed by Chris Columbus. It is the second movie of the franchise and compared to the first one it doesn't have to dedicate a lot of it's time on introducing us to the wizarding world of the Harry Potter universe, as it has already been set up. Therefore it can use its entire run time to expand on the first entry.The story is a lot darker than the previous one and for the first time there is at least a slight feeling that our characters are in real danger. Furthermore the movie improves a lot on its visual effects and has a score and both costume and production design that are just as good as in the first one.Although the movie has a lot it improved upon in its details, I still think that this film is the worst entry in the franchise. This is due to a rather poor story, which is somewhat darker than the first, however it doesn't capture the magic as well as the beginning of its predecessor and ends up just as unsatisfactory.Like I have mentioned in my review to ""the Philosopher's Stone"" these two movies (compared to the later instalments) struggle to find an adult-like ending. This could be a result of the age of our lead characters, however it is very likely that the director and the whole crew behind the project just didn't know how dark of a story they can tell and get away with it.Overall this movie just seems very similar to the first one, in some ways its better and in some ways its worse. I just really appreciate the decision to have a new director handle ""the Prisoner of Azkaban"", as it is considerably the best entry in the franchise.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Harry Potter and chamber full of mystery,"Harry Potter and chamber of secrets proved to be a better adaption to the big screen than the first movie. Even though it was't long after the first, the acting of our young trio does improve here. The effects are better too, we get too see alot more magic. Despite not getting as much detail as in the books the mystery is genuinely absorbing. A great follow up after a good first entry.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Weaker than the first,"As a rabid Harry Potter fan, I eagerly awaited this movie and I couldn't help but be disappointed. Naturally, since I've devoured all of the books, I had some ideas about how this movie should be and, as a result, came away feeling let down. It can't be said enough that the casting of these movies is masterful. Snape was never a particular favorite of mine and although I initially felt that Alan Rickman was miscast, he soon did away with all of my apprehensions. He is masterful as Snape. With the simple curl of a lip or a subtle change in the slant of his eyebrow, he can convey the sinister nature of Snape and his expressions are every bit as inscrutable as the Snape from the books. It was a pleasure to see that Rickman was not the only wonderful cast member to return. The actors do a wonderful job of really inhabiting their characters and the child actors have grown since the previous movie. The fact that they're the same actors helps maintain the continuity that is so important to the HP works as a whole. Not only are Harry and his friends growing in the books, so are the actors who portray them. Another very strong point of this movie was Dobby, a character I loved in the books. In spite of his odd and rather ugly appearance, there is something sweet and endearing about him. He's loyalty personified--even though he can be a pain in the rear. His voice was wonderful too and it was such a treat to see him move from the page and into ""real"" life. Jason Isaacs is another welcome addition to the cast of characters and he infuses Lucius Malfoy with cold, elegant menace. He's every bit as intimidating as Snape but with a thin veneer of charm and elegance. Isaacs really made the character come to life for me. Yet in spite of all this, what I sorely missed in this movie was the delicious humor that permeated nearly every page of the book. I've long felt that Chamber of Secrets is the funniest of the HP books but much of the humor was stripped from the movie in order to move the plot along. I felt that this did the story a disservice as humor so often proves such a saving grace in Harry's world.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"lots of flash, no substance","Once again, the fantastic production design almost fools you (and does fool many people) into thinking that you are watching a good movie. But it doesn't hold up in the end, as the completely non-heroic ""hero"" Harry Potter is led by the nose through another predictable mystery in the mechanical, eliteist Hogwarts. A lot of respected actors try very hard to appear quirky and compelling, but in the end this story has little interest and the film has no heart or soul.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Let's hope they are all this good!,"This is what the first movie should have been - the right mix between action and story.  I love the books.  Right away I will tell you that.  I started reading them when the second book was published - and I anxiously await the fifth next year.  I was sadly disappointed . . . or disheartened, rather - by the first HP movie.  I didn't think it captured the engaging magic of Harry Potter and his friends - and his world, and his life.  This movie gets it.  Maybe it is because the foundation was laid with Sorcerer's Stone. Maybe it's because it is a better movie.  This movie gives an excellent story to those who do not read the books, as well as a few winks and smiles to those of us who have read them.Either way, if you weren't sucked in after seeing the first movie - give this one a chance.  These three kids have such incredible chemistry I am shocked they have not been signed for a 4th movie at this time, because of concerns about their age.  I am much more willing to suspend my disbelief of them being a bit too tall for the role, than I am about seeing three new actors as Harry, Ron and Hermione.Dobby does not need to warn you - this is a great flick.And, by all means, give the books a try!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

I was so looking forward to seeing this movie - hoping that the ineptitude displayed by Chris Columbus in the philosopher's stone would have been rectified, but I was horribly disappointed. Flashes of brilliance in cameos or effects and background details are overshadowed by poor handling of the young cast and jumpy leaps in plot. Kenneth Branagh, Mark Williams and Alan Rickman among others threaten to steal the show from the younger cast members amidst much improved special effects and scenery.It's probably great, but the book's better, and my imagination has a much higher budget and a far better director than Columbus",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Daniel's acting were quite so-so, though I still cannot get over his ""kiddy"" voice yet when the third movie was filmed. The first two Harry Potter series were filmed by the director of ""Home Alone 1 and 2"". The direction the film was filmed was really good, and the brightness of certain points of the movie can be seen or the scary parts like when Harry Potter had to fight the snake.

"enjoyable, but flawed by lack of detail","As an older Harry Potter fan who has read the books, i found ""The Chamber of Secrets"" to be enjoyable, but a bit of a let-down after the ""The Sorcerer's Stone."" I understand that the story is far more complicated than the first book, but i do not believe that an appropriate compromise was reached between the mystery and the details of Harry's childhood. It seems as though, not only were the details of the mystery insufficient, but that Harry's coming-of-age has been almost completely ignored. However, in spite of some very bad acting from Draco Malfoy, there are plenty of exciting moments and the movie is fun throughout. They should look into replacing Malfoy as the new Dumbledore is chosen. It would be an added incentive to see the third movie. 7 out of 10 (for a potter fan)",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Films created by Warner Brothers are masterpiece just because they dared to recreate this world. This beautiful excursion to that world, and I wish to see a kind of TV series, but it is impossible, because such talented actors will never agree to participate such lon project.

"As Ron Weasly would say, this movie is ""bloody brilliant""","As Ron Weasley would say, this movie is ""bloody brilliant."" Of course, this time around he would say it in a much deeper voice. Indeed the children from the first film have matured beyond what anyone could have expected. Even though filming reportedly began shortly after The Sorcerer's Stone opened a year ago, every single child character seems to have gone through the biggest parts of puberty in just a year. Ron's (Rupert Grint) voice is cracklier, Harry's (Daniel Radcliffe) is deeper, Malfoy (Tom Felton) seems to have grown feet, not inches, and Granger (Emma Watson) has transformed into an even more mature version of herself.The magic of our introduction to these characters and to the world of Wizardry is gone and this film is much darker than the first; barely any daylight penetrates the school. Most children will find a few of the scenes much too frightening where as Sorcerer's Stone was a film that everyone could find delightful. The spider sequence in the Forbidden Forest scared me more than anything else since Arachnophobia. Surprise surprise, I'm arachnophobic (mostly due to the aforementioned movie), but the fact remains that this sequence, and many similar ones in the movie, were treated as they would be in any great mainstream thriller. Even though I'm still emotionally shaken from that scene, I respect that Columbus does not sacrifice anything just to make it more acceptable.I am able to respect this mostly because this movie is an even greater visual treat than the first (as if that were possible). Even though I used to be a huge special effects advocate, after the recent Star Wars disasters and a hoard of other films that have misused special effects, I have gone over to the other side. Then comes along the first two installments of this series, which make better use of special effects than any other movies I have ever seen. In Chamber, there is a Quiddich match between Gryffindor and Slytherin that is even more heart pounding than the one in Sorcerer's Stone (again, as if that were possible). The seeker's, Potter and Malfoy, chase thorough the bowels of the stadium after the Golden Snitch with a rogue bludger trying to take Harry out for good. If the Quiddich matches keep getting better and better, I can't wait to see what they will do for the fourth installment, Goblet of Fire, where our heroes go to the Quiddich World Cup. Even before the Quiddich match we are treated to a Whomping Willow which is grander, more violent, and more visually pleasing than I was prepared for. And then there's good ol' Dobby - the most successful fully animated character in a live action film. While Jar Jar Binks was a technical marvel, I don't know a person on this planet what wouldn't pay to see him killed. Dobby could have been another Jar Jar, but his screen time is kept in check and his humor is just right. There's also a flying car, a huge snake (which may be as frightening to children as the spiders), a duel between Malfoy and Potter, a great hall that is even more gorgeous than before, and a flurry of small but pleasing wizardry special effects.My biggest reason for liking this movie is that it is the best fusion between an older style of filmmaking and a newer one. It makes use of the grand technology that we have today, but never lets it dominate the incredibly engaging characters, especially the supporting cast, nor does it hinder the progression of the plot one bit. Richard Harris will be sorely missed as Headmaster Albus Dumbledore. He brought such great charisma to the film and his role gets more and more vital as the series continues. I hope that Radcliffe, Grint, Watson, and Felton all decide to stay on for the entire series. Each of them is such a perfect fit for their role that it is hard to imagine anyone else playing Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Draco. Then there's Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid and all the other professors at the school - each of which is so different from the other that it is hard to give each of them enough screen time without making the movie even longer.It is inevitable that every fantasy movie will have a few things that I wish would have been done different. I wanted to spend a little more time with the Weasley family because each one of them is such a delight and their house is a small magical wonderland. But, I understand that it was important for this film to get onto center stage as quickly as possible, and center stage for this film meant Hogwarts. Even though my memory is a little hazy, there were some interesting classroom scenes that were left out (again, understandable because none of them are truly necessary). My biggest regret is that Ron and Hermione, who are constantly at each other's throats in the novel, don't have that same relationship in the movie. There is part in the end where they refrain from hugging to shake hands. My editor, who has not read the novels, was understandably confused as to why they didn't hug.As I said earlier, Chamber of Secrets is the worst novel in the series. Actually, it's the only one I haven't read twice. Luckily, the plot structure, twists and turns are what Rowling has never failed at. I enjoyed the ways the mystery was revealed piece by piece even though I had previous knowledge of everything. The third act of the movie consists of a long stretch of action (intertwined with all the revelations to bring the story full circle). This is where most movies would screw everything up and settle into a final battle that is pedestrian if even that. Chamber of Secrets builds up to this the entire time so a final battle sequence with Harry, a large snake, and a phoenix is more than welcome. We've waited for it for over two hours, we need the payoff. The hardest part of a movie might be the post climax wrap up. I remember how much I enjoyed Dumbledore's final chat with Harry in the first installment, and the same thing happens here. Additionally, there is a little ""standoff"" between slave Dobby and master Lucius Malfoy that gave everyone a good laugh.Here are a few quick things I could spend hours more writing about: the humor in this film keeps it alive and energetic in an otherwise dark and frightening setting. Stuart Craig (the production designer) has returned to create an incredible marvelous magical world by expanding the grandeur of Hogwarts. We get to venture into parts of the school that we had no idea existed before with little nooks, crannies, pipes, bathrooms, classrooms, and so much more. Kenneth Branagh (who plays Gilderoy Lockhart) is a wonderful addition to the established cast of teachers and clearly enjoys himself in this role. John Williams again provides a musical score which is so far the best this year. Jason Isaacs (Lucius Malfoy) makes himself contemptible and dark from the very beginning and keeps the evil vibe in every scene he is in. The pacing is incredible, it jumps right into the plotline and into the world of wizardry because all the basic rules have already been established.I don't know how this second installment will be received, but it is a rare feat in modern cinema: a second installment that is as good as, if not better than, the first. With Columbus no longer opting to direct the third installment (due out in 2004), I hope that the next two movies don't falter because this could easily be the greatest series in film history. Harry Potter has made more than a believer out of me with a world as grand and imaginative as Lucas's original Star Wars trilogy, but with sufficiently more in terms of characters and witty dialogue. And to think, a year ago I would have liked nothing more than to see the Sorcerer's Stone fail. And then I saw the movie. Oh what a difference a year makes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Good second installment in the Harry Potter series.,"Interestingly, most professional critics and many ""users"" say this second Harry Potter movie is better than the first. However, as of this date both of them have identical IMDb ratings of 7.3.  I actually like the first one more, maybe because in it everything is new, and I especially enjoyed seeing how Harry began to recognize his powers, and the introductions of all the main characters and Hogwarts.  Secondly, each character, and actor, is a year older which doesn't always improve them. Like Hermoine, I thought she was much cuter when she was a year younger. Ditto with Harry.Inspite of all that, I enjoyed the film, and my 8-year-old granddaughter especially liked it, so much in fact that she wanted to watch it again right away.  I resisted, maybe we will watch it again tonight.  A bright spot in all this, the studio made a great decision to avoid over-pricing the DVD. I bought it for $15, now I own the first two, and I expect to buy each of the next as they come out.  Although I'm not really a collector at heart, I figure my grandchildren would appreciate having the full set eventually.As one would expect, the DVD is very sharp, and the 5.1 surround sound is used very well. Although I have not watched any extras yet, the listing appears interesting and the menu is much more easy to use than was the first one. Overall a clear winner for Harry Potter fans.(Additional thoughts. Thinking back to various action/fantasy movies which resulted in a series of films, e.g. Back To The Future, Superman, Batman, Indiana Jones, Lord of the Rings, Romancing the Stone, are examples that immediately come to mind, I always found the first one to be the best. Is that because the first movie reveals most of the new secrets of the story, and we find that most interesting? The second, third, etc. in many cases just continue various stories around what we discovered in the first movie? Or do we just quickly become bored with a concept?  Several sequels of superb movies are currently in the make, The Matrix, X-Men, Spiderman, Charlie's Angels come to mind. It will be interesting to see how they do. ""Mission Impossible 2"" is one that I actually like a lot better than the first one.)",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

an empty vessel,"Heartless. That best describes what I have been left feeling from the Harry Potter franchise thus far. Having watched a special preview this weekend, I was rather disappointed by the latest offering. Aesthetically, the film is quite stunning and succeeds in convincing me that some love has been poured into the movie. Nontheless, a film can not shine without a tight script and decent performances. The main problem however, lies with the direction of Mr Columbus who only seems to be regurgitating the 'winning' formula of the first. In it's faithfulness to the novel, the plot somehow transposes poorly on celluloid, meandering around for a good two hours. Indeed, I was left wondering - what is the Chamber of Secrets??? I don't think Columbus knew either.The three child leads are becoming more gangly as adolescence runs its course, and their performances did little to take my eyes from their elongated faces. Kenneth Branagh steals the show as the vain Lockhart, but is cancelled out by the incredibly irritating Dobie. This computer generated misfit takes up far too much screen time with his rambling and masochistic tendencies. The script itself does little to rectify the vague plot and save the movie. On the contrary, its hokey sentiment detracts from Rowling's creation and leaves an excessively saccharine taste.At times it was fun, and I dont want to be condemned as a cynic. It is a kid's film after all, and I was certainly not expecting a masterpiece of modern cinema. Nontheless, for all that it tries to be, i could not help feeling unattached to the characters and wishing it had ended a good half hour before. Good luck to the next film, and let's hope Harry isn't six foot tall and hairy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Better than the first movie; better than the book,"Chamber of Secrets starts off with the feel of the first movie:  Anadaptation of a successful book.  But about a third of the waythrough, director Chris Columbus seems to have read the reviewsof his initial offering and decided to change the tone.  A very wisemove.

Kids in general will like it for themagic, for the friendship, for the gross and icky scenes, and for thespectacle.  The movie makes the right omissions from the book:The opening is pared back, the ending is shortened, the plot isexposed in a more cinematic fashion.  I have two disappointments, one forgivable:  A major sub-plot with NearlyHeadless Nick is eliminated.  I forgive them, since it would get inthe way of the movie action, but John Cleese as Nick isunderutilized.  The one part they get wrong is Gilroy.

"Grand, better than the first","I've read all the harry potter books 2-3 times a piece, so its cool tosee the story on screen.  This movie stays truer to the book thanSorcerer's Stone did, and I liked that.  I did not like getting out at12:50 am, after sitting for 2 hrs and 40 min (or so).  To be sure, Ithink that they had a preview of every genre of movie, just to try andhit all  target audiences that might show up.  Anyhoo, I loved theaventurous heart of this movie, even when they changed a fewthings (ie,  ""your palms are sweaty.""  HA!)  I still miss  JK Rowlingswit and sense of the ironic, although it was captured more in thisscript than in the second.  Ah well, you can't have everything.

Wicked,"This was one of the best movies ever made. I loved the spiders, Moaning Myrtle, and the special effects. I also loved how most of the actors seemed to slip right into their roles.

much too long and redundant,"Having enjoyed ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" very much, I was quite disappointed after viewing ""The Chamber of Secrets"" this weekend.  I had been informed by friends who had seen both films that it was more entertaining and a more interesting story.  Had I read the books maybe I wouldn't have been surprised, but I was taken aback with Harry being back at his relative's home at the beginning.  This was a very long and tedious introduction that was essentially a rehash of the first movie, and the character of the House Elf was so reminiscent of Jar Jar Binks in his voice and enunciation that I could hardly stand it.  The movie was replete with redundancies from the first movie such as the quillage game, and I found it to be very boring to the point of almost putting me to sleep at times.  The special effects and scenery were still quite wonderful, but I do hope that the next installment will be more original and take a unique and fresh direction.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
An enjoyable movie if not for the unanswered questions and poor ending,"I hate to say it, but this was actually quite good, and definitely far better than the first movie. The characterisation is much better, although they still carry through a few too many ideas and there is, once again, a problem at the end with tying up the loose ends far too quickly and neatly but still leaving too many unanswered questions.There's a lot more darkness and levity to this story, and less concentrating on the pure kids element, which I think is beneficial for the the audience of adults and children alike.The effects are also ramped up a notch from the first, and with no overly CGI effect scenes like the Quidditch match, they are all quite believable. Almost too much for me in the case of the spiders.Kenneth Branagh is particularly enjoyable on screen, and plays a thoroughly comedic character, something he does very well considering the majority of his performances. Robbie Coltrane provides my second favourite performance in this episode, and he comes across as a thoroughly likable giant. Alan Rickman and Jason Isaacs outperforming each other on the creepy, slimy stakes, Emma Watson as Hermione is much less eyebrow and annunciation. It has to be said the casting is extremely good.All in all an enjoyable movie, despite the ending tie ups and the unanswered questions, it does hold up well. Just not something I would particularly want to watch again.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

God help us all.,"Ugh. I can't begin to describe how much this movie is horrible. I feel like punching that Radcliff bastard in the face, he's the main reason this movie sucked so bad. The acting in this movie was horrible, completely and must utterly horrible. Especially because of Daniel Radcliff.Chris Columbus turned an amazing book into a third grade children's movie. I can't believe this movie got a 7.3 rating. And what truly shocked me was that the third movie only got a 7.8. I'd give this movie a negative rating if I could compared to the The Prisoner of Azkaban. Alfonso CuarÃ³n did a great job on it, made it a much darker movie, a much more of a serious movie. He managed to turn it from a kids movie, from something you'd expect the Olsen Twins or Lindsy Lohan to pop up any second to a real quality film. Maybe not an excellent movie, still, something you could enjoy watching.While watching the first and second movies I felt like I was about to vomit any minute, and the look on my face was as if I just turned on my TV only to that all my channels turned into VH1 Classic on a permanent 70's clip show, or MCM on a never-ending french clip run (AKA - MCM at any given time.)

"Contender for the worst film sequel ever, I'd say?","It's startling how such a marvellous movie series can have on such an aberration, especially considering how it comes from the same director that made Philosopher's Stone such a wonderful and rewatchable family film. Chamber of Secrets in contrast won't please either of the family members: the kids are only going to be disturbed by the violence and intensity in it, while the adults are likely to laugh at how ridiculous these particular scenes are made. Why not pursue the darker, grittier style the way every sequel after this one did, especially when the subject has moments as terrifying for young children as Chamber of Secrets has. But enough of that because the false approach and the shocking PG rating (both in the UK and the US) aren't the reason this film has disappointed me as heavily as it did. Maybe it was the missing break between shooting the first and the second film of the Harry Potter series that made Chris Columbus and his crew lose most about what was so great about Philosopher's Stone and replace with silly physical humour and sloppy screen writing. What has to be said out of fairness as well is that the novel it is based on is as well the weakest in the series, with the introduction of the three most annoying characters in the Harry Potter universe: Dobby, Colin Creevey and Gilderoy Lockhart. Miraculously, as the cast chiefly stayed the same, all the actors gave a worse performance in Chamber of Secrets, most of all the child actors that now simply must have felt overstrained. Additionally, the CGI was lousy and everything entertaining about it has been there in Philosopher's Stone already. Granted, I still enjoyed the cinematography, set design, and score, and Hogwarts hasn't lost its magical atmosphere in Chamber of Secrets, but the fact that this isn't a good film is defined by just one simply statement: there was not one scene in the film that I really enjoyed. And that says an awful lot about what is actually my favourite film series.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Delightful improvement,"This was a delightful improvement on the first Harry Potter which was too short and too crammed. In this was there was time to tell the story and excellent acting from the better parts of the actors. Three hours may be a tad long for the youngest audience but considering the relatively high level of spookyness, perhaps they should stay in bed while their parents go and what this movie.The magic was more magical and the small puffs of smoke a nice touch. And the spiders... Whhrhrhr-yuck!The addition of Kenneth Branagh as Gilderoy Lockhart was neat. Not only was he a slimey fraud he actually seemed to enjoy the parody of himself. Also Lucius Malfoy was as well cast as his son was not.All in all a brilliant movie and true to the book. Perhaps the Quidditch game was a bit too long but hey, you can't have it all.The art department could, I might add, take a bit more care making the books look old. Two pages shown in the movie had right adjusted margins which is somewhat modern considering they were supposed to look hand written.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Excellent!! But....,"The film was really enjoyable, more entertaining than the first and more of a plot line.I really enjoyed the much improved special effects, the quidditch scene was seamless, dobby, the basilisk and the womping willow were all amazingly life like and the great hall was it's usual believable self.I found the acting to be greatly improved from the last movie, with the three main kiddies spouting their wizarding words believably.Yet there are some downers. The quidditch scene was too short, the whole thing began too quickly, the movie failed to show Arthur, Fred and George Weasley for who they really are and the ending portrayed Hagrid as the hero.But all in all it was a thoroughly enjoyable film which i will definately be seeing again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
I do so hope they act better as they grow up,"Not that it's bad, mind you. Quidditch scenes are fascinating, visuals and camerawork are effective as ever. Robbie Coltrane and Dame Maggie Smith are as you've come to expect. Branagh is adequate and Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy is definitely an asset.That said, the second instalment in Harry Potter series is miles weaker than the first, and I mean it. And the weakest part is acting. The director is too busy getting the hell on with his story to pay any attention to how the younger actors are faring. And they are disastrously overacting! Looks like they've forgot what they still remembered a year ago. Not that overacting is exclusively their privilege. Older actors are at it, too. And that makes the Potter world seem very unreal. You are hardly allowed to forget it's the adaptation of a fairytale book you're watching.Dursleys gathering round Harry to ask him what he'll be doing when the Masons arrive, twins putting on big eyes when their mother threatens Ron, or, God forbid, Seamus Finnigan laughing - scenes like that in any other movie would send director's rating crashing into the white cliffs of Dover. Mr Columbus must be grateful it's HP that he shoots. People'll munch at it anyway.I understand this is essentially a kids' movie, but one can remember some kids' movies which are good on multiple levels. There is very little in this one for adults. I'll take Oliver Wood's new Quidditch training plan and leave, if you permit. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
With a Flick of the Magic Wand...,"The magic is back!  Harry, Hermione, and Ron Weasley return to the screen with yet another adventure, bigger and better than ever, as they begin their second year at Hogwarts.  With a veritable flick of his magic wand, director Chris Columbus offers up `Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,' the second chapter in the on-going saga of everybody's favorite young wizard, who is joined this time around by a new instructor (teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts), as well as some formidable new opponents.  There's also a couple of surprises along the way as Harry encounters a rather singular character in his bedroom, and another deep in the Forbidden Forest.  And, yes, there IS a Quidditch match.Harry's second year at Hogwarts begins inauspiciously with a warning to stay away; someone-- or some'thing'-- doesn't want him there.  Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is undeterred, of course, and is soon back in Gryffindor House along with his friends and fellow students.  But the warnings persist, now written in blood on the walls, and they portend an ominous fate for Harry, as well as many of the other students of witchcraft and wizardry.  The messages indicate that the `Chamber of Secrets' has been opened, and that dire consequences (for some unknown reason) are about to befall many of those in attendance at the school.  And this is serious business; enough to make Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith) fear that Hogwarts may have to be closed indefinitely.So it's up to Harry, Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) to get to the bottom of the mystery.  And they don't have much time; already one of the students has been found literally `petrified' in the hall, and the perpetrator is still unknown and at large.  Harry knows the answers can be found in the Chamber of Secrets, but the questions persist:  `What' is it, exactly, and `where' can it be found?As if channeling the spirit and imagination of author J.K. Rowling (in whose heart Harry Potter was born), director Columbus brings this film vividly to life in a swirl of excitement and colorful characters.  He sets a perfect pace that will keep even the youngest members of the audience enthralled, and his transitions are impeccable, always moving the story forward with nary a single lull or hesitation.  It's a film that will grab you in the opening frames and sweep! you along to the finish.Written for the screen by Steven Kloves (adapted from the novel by Rowling), the story is compelling, the dialogue is fresh and crisp and, as expected, the special F/X are the absolute best.  And Columbus uses it all to great effect, aided in no small part by the exemplary work of film editor Peter Honess, the original score by William Ross and John Williams, Roger Pratt's brilliant cinematography, and last, but certainly not least, the engaging performances turned in by his young stars and veteran performers alike.Young Daniel Radcliffe's portrayal of Harry is so complete and natural that, simply put, he IS, and will forever be, `Harry Potter.'  It's the kind of definitive performance that will always, without question, be a part of Radcliff's life, putting him in such dignified company as Sean Connery (James Bond), Leonard Nimoy (Spock) and Basil Rathbone (Sherlock Holmes). And, for better or worse, that's not such a bad place to be.  He has a gift, and if he uses it wisely, he has a long and successful career ahead of him.The characters of Hermione and Ron Weasley are definitive, as well, but not in the way that Radcliffe's Harry is, but inasmuch as it would be impossible hereafter to accept anyone else but Watson and Grint as, respectively, Hermione and Ron.  Their portrayals are solid, endearing and entirely convincing; who will ever forget Hermione's adamant stare, or Ron's bemused expression of befuddlement?  Though without a doubt they will always be associated with these characters, they have the kind of talent that should take them successfully beyond their `Potter' personas.  And hopefully they will make choices in the future conducive to their auspicious `star-making' turns in these films.Kenneth Branagh gives a delightful performance as Gilderoy Lockhart, the new instructor at Hogwarts, whose self-importance has made him a legend in his own mind.  He is pompous and self-serving, but in a fun kind of way that allows you to see immediately beneath the mask of his vanity and his puffed up ego; he's the Wizard of Oz revealed as the man behind the curtain.  And Branagh plays him perfectly.In this chapter we're also introduced to Draco Malfoy's father, Lucius Malfoy, played with deliciously restrained malevolence by Jason Isaacs. After meeting Lucius, it's easy to see that Draco (Tom Felton) is an apple that didn't fall far from the tree.Also turning in a memorable performance is Shirley Henderson, as the empathetic, disenfranchised ghost, Moaning Myrtle, doomed to forever roam the lavatory in which she met her untimely and premature demise.  With very little screen time, she manages to make a decided connection with the audience, which makes her an effective and integral part of the story.Reprising the roles they established and made their own in `Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,' are Richard Harris (Dumbledore); Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid); Alan Rickman (Professor Severus Snape); Bonnie Wright (in an expanded role this time, as Ginny Weasley); Julie Walters (Mrs. Weasley); John Cleese (Nearly Headless Nick); Richard Griffiths (Uncle Vernon); Fiona Shaw (Aunt Petunia); and Harry Melling (Dudley).The additional supporting cast includes Toby Jones (extremely effective as the voice of Dobby, the House Elf), Christian Coulson (Tom Marvolo Riddle), Miriam Margolyes (Professor Sprout) and Sally Mortemore (Madam Pince).  Be forewarned, there's a scene in the Forbidden Forest that will absolutely make your skin crawl; but it's all a part of the fun, and by the final scene of `Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,' you WILL, without a doubt, believe in magic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Harry Potter 2 - Quite interesting,"The one main reason why I like this movie is : It is exciting, and keeps me nervous all the time. During the part in which Harry fights with Riddle, at first Harry is beaten by the curse & I really think that Harry would die. However, with the help of the Phoneix which is sent by Dumbledore, Harry finally can escape from the attack and be safe. In addition, the music, the vivid acting of characters, it all makes me thrill and as if I were in the scene, witnessing the whole incident. I think the music is well written and digital sound effect in the theatre is astonishing. I can still hear all the sound effects even when I am sleeping. Besides, the story fulfills the spirit and the ideal of youngsters: fight against the enemy and having mysterious adventure. I learnt that we have to be brave when we are in tough situation. Furthermore, we need to have confidence for ourselves and at last the good guy can beat the evil. Though we can see such plot and philosophy in other movies, but I am truly touched in this particular one. The story seems to be a mystery when people become petrified one by one. However, with Harry at the most important role, he solves the mystery by himself and fights against Lord Voldemort. Finally he wins and there comes a happy ending. I think throughout the whole movie, the acting of characters, the music, the set-up and the storyline all reach a satisfactory standard for audience.I strongly recommend that all students should watch this movie as it is one of the greatest movies one should not miss. After watching it, I come out with a view that life is full of hope. The only thing is you have to be determinant and at last you will win.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

the books are great but the  movies are average,"I thought the second Potter movie would be much better because I liked the second book a lot more. The book was very funny. I laughed out loud reading the Gilderoy Lockhart parts. But, the movie never made me laugh out. They tried to put some of the funny moments in the book in the movie, but they just didn't seem  very funny in the movie.  The best part about the movie was Dobby. Dobby looked very real, and he was just like what was described in the book.  But, I guess the books just don't make great movies because there are so many great characters and side plots in the books that you can't put in a movie because of time restraints.  The movie is nearly 3 hours, but it just seems rather boring because they try to include as much from the book as they can, so it feels like a lot of scenes are cut short. Plus all the books take place over the course of the entire school year. And it is very hard to make a movie feel like that much time has passed.FINAL VERDICT: Young kids will love the movies. But, for adults, reading the books are much better.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Review,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a film directed by Chris Columbus. After watching the first film which I liked a lot, I was pretty excited for the second part. After watching it I can say that I enjoyed this particular part too.Plot: Harry Potter is warned by Dobby, a House elf not to attend Hogwarts School of Magic as danger awaits him.Story and direction: This film is one of those rare sequels which improve upon the first. This film doesn't take time to set up things. But instead we are immediately thrown into action. Also introduced are some new characters which impressed me like Lucius Malfoy and Ginny Weasley and another one not being of much importance like Gilderoy Lockhart. If this character was removed it wouldn't be much of a loss to this film. The funny scenes also feel funny and not forced. John Williams' score is again awesome and I can just hear it again and again. The film deals with another theme which I liked a lot the way it was handled. As for the VFX, although it has improved much from the first part but still there are some imperfections. There is some animatronic work with creatures which were excellent. It felt like the creatures were real and would jump out of the screen. The sets are massive and adorable. The action scenes in this film were great.They were so believe-able that I had goosebumps. Even though the film is longer than the first part, I felt much more entertained by this film. Chris Columbus and Steve Kloves have again done a wonderful job in providing us another chapter in this universe that not only makes us happy but also makes you feel for the characters in those particular settings. This film does have a post credit scene but I didn't think that the film did need that.Performances: All of the regular cast members did an outstanding job. Jason Isaacs was bad (in a good way) as Lucius Malfoy. Kenneth Branagh was also good in the material that was provided to him. Mark Williams as Arthur Weasley did a fine job. The voice of Dobby by Toby Jones was awesome. I didn't know that he voiced Dobby until I read it in the internet.Favorite Scene: It would be one where Hagrid consoles Hermione about her parents being muggle and both Harry and Ron providing support to her. This scene showed not only showed the strong bond between the kids but also how much Hagrid cares for Harry's gang.Verdict: For a sequel, this film just ticks all the boxes. I had a great time with this film. It improved upon the first and also opened many new doors for the future films. I just can't wait to see what this series has yet to offer me.I am going with an 8.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Entertaining and sometimes exhilarating film that is slightly superior to its predecessor but still pales when compared to the book..,"Christopher Columbus, the director of the first two Harry Potter movies, has had a heavy burden to bear. He had to recreate on the screen what millions of adults and children imagined when they read J.K Rowling's books, he had to bring the characters and world alive for those who had never read the novels, balance out being exciting enough for the adults with not being too scary for the kids and endure the inevitable, unflattering comparisons with not just the books but Peter Jackson's superb ÂFellowship of the Ring'. Overall he's done a decent job Â the first movie was a good though straight and occasionally flat reproduction of ÂThe Philosopher's Stone' and ÂThe Chamber of Secrets' is an improvement on that, if not a major one.If you haven't seen or read ÂThe Philosopher's Stone' then don't bother watching this, as it will be very hard to follow what is going on. For those of you who have and want a summary of the plot, Harry again escapes from the Dursleys, his horrible non-magical relatives, and returns to Hogwarts, despite receiving a warning from a house-elf called Dobby that his life will be in danger. And indeed when he gets back there he not only has to worry about his enemies Professor Snape and Draco Malfoy, and the narcissistic new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor Gilderoy Lockhart, he also discovers that there is something monstrous stalking the corridors of Hogwarts, something that only he can hear.Like the book, the movie ÂThe Chamber of Secrets' is darker than it's predecessor and will be too scary for many young children. This makes it more intense and enjoyable for most of us adults, though there are a couple of moments in the climax where Columbus shies away from fully showing some graphic violence, which reduces the power of the scene. It is a difficult balance that he has to maintain and while he does a great job in an earlier scene with giant spiders, he can't quite pull it off for Rowling's pretty gory finale. Unfortunately again the movie is not as thrilling or satisfying as the book, as Columbus still does not seem to have the pacing and atmosphere quite right for every scene in the film. Some, like those with the Dursleys and the Weasleys at the start, do not seem long enough to fully bring across the flavour of the book. At other times what is happening is not properly explained, which would be confusing for those who have not read the book - parts of the climactic battle especially seem merely convenient rather than miraculous -  while in the middle the movie gets a bit slow. Parts of this are not Columbus' or the screenwriters' fault Â the movie is a long one already and getting across the richness of detail a book has in just a few hours is always difficult. Unlike in the first movie they did feel confident enough to make some sensible changes to the sacred text, such as adding to the book's action scenes and cutting out some minor details, but I do feel things could have been done better, perhaps by dwelling on some things a little more, cutting out some minor plotlines, and adding to the atmosphere of some scenes by using bit more music and some more imaginative camerawork.However I should not get too negative, as this is an enjoyable and exciting movie. The special effects and sets are marvellous and one of the ways in which it is an improvement on ÂThe Philosopher's Stone' is because of Daniel Radcliffe's performance as Harry. He still does not completely capture what I imagined the young wizard to be like, but he is livelier and more charismatic than he was in the first movie. The rest of the cast are very good, and there are two delicious performances from Kenneth Branagh as Lockhart and Jason Isaacs as the arrogant Lucius Malfoy. Seeing Richard Harris's final appearance is quite poignant too, as there is a quaver in his voice that suggests he was not a well man. Finding a replacement for him will not be easy.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A Continuation on a High Level.,"""Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets"" is a very nice and creepy sequel, that really does the fear in a better way, compared to the first one. The atmosphere is much greater, with some really thrilling and violent moments at times. It had the magic, but in a different way. Harry, Ron and Hermione returns, the same cast is settled in (Including the teachers) and the beginning was kind of similar to the first movie, but not exactly. When Ron and Harry miss the train to Hogwarts, they got to take the responsibility in their hands and come to school in a different way. That ""Different way"" was showed in a very fun and entertaining way. Generally speaking, I think that the second part is more for the whole family. The first one felt mostly for kids than a movie for the whole family too watch, but the sequel those the job and take care of that problem. The suspense moments was well build-up, much action that holds, and the big mystery they got to solve is interesting and really keeps things hidden. I felt much more connected to the castle, too, mostly because they used they're time well in here, as well as exploring new rooms, teachers and strategies at Quidditch (The ball game they have at school). The camera filming is on a high level, as well as the fast motions and unexpected turns of action, with great plot twists. Harry's character was less developed in here, we know that he still miss his parents after the unexpected attack, but that was that. It's getting more developed at the end, but not exactly from his side of life. Daniel Radcliffe did an upgrade and played much better here than previously, but I think mostly because it's about the experience. You learn best from experience, they say. Concluding, the Harry Potter sequel was fun, entertaining, and got that creepy moments. More enjoyable than the first, an the humor and moral was high and valuable as always.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Also was able to watch this from one sitting. The big budget is used well in this, especially when it comes to the special effects for 2002. Also all the good parts in the book is in this movie, in fact this stays flawlessly with the novel all the way too the end. Which is great, so overall it's a faithful adaptation.

"It Starts, It Ends, and In Between Magic Happens","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is more than a continuation on a familiar theme, its an improvement and a redefinition of that theme. Like the Wizard of Oz's follow ups, I was worried this one could not live up to its magnificent predecessor. Luckily, I erred. This film is truly great. It has all the fun of the first and more. The story has Harry returning to Hogwarts, older, smarter, and edgier, and thus the film is darker and more gritty, as Harry faces the fact that he might yet have no small amount of darkness in him. Though this is lamentably Harris' last film, his Dumbledore is remarkable and is one of his finer works (and that is no small task in and of itself). Though it is not without flaws (Where did Branagh go? Rickman as Snape occurred all too little in this one, though his screen time was remarkably well spent). This film is fun, smart, and actually heartening... Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid and a well placed phoenix truly touched the audience I saw this film with.

There are so much more laughs. The special effects were very impressive. The Basilisk had my jaw falling to the ground.Much better than the first one. This has the quality that the first one should have had. This just keeps getting better and better.7/10,7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"If you aren't in love with Potter, forget it.","I seemed to be unique in the theatre the night I attended with my wife and her niece. Judging from the laughter at unfunny things and the telegraphing of key moments by the audience's gasps before anything had happened on screen, not many in the theatre were new to Potter. Because I have not read  more than a page of any Harry Potter book or ever seen any portion of a movie I had the advantage of looking at this boring movie with an unbiased eye. The story is inane and silly, full of cliches and standard scenes. The acting is dull. There is not actually one believable character in the whole movie.  As if this isn't bad enough, the movie goes on endlessly.  Apparently if you're a Potter fan there is no limit to your stomach for it.  Enough said.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
okay...,"I have seen the first film and I feel the same about this one.  Not really a lot to it.  Just another movie to watch as far as I'm concerned.  It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't that great either.  I find myself saying the same thing about this movie that I said about the last.  It's just way too Disney for me.  I am not saying I am not looking forward to the next movie, because I am.  My feeling is the context of the film seems to drag on, and instead of being really excited of what might happen next, I find myself not being surprised at what happens at all.  I still like the overall look of the film, the actors are good, the direction and the special effects are good, but, I am only just okay with this whole genre of films.  I give it a 5 out of 10.  Maybe renting it would be an even better idea.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Superb!,"J K Rowling has a unique talent. She takes the basic structure of a boarding school story and works in elements of classical mythology, Arthurian legend and many other things. Because she taps into so many diverse sources that is one reason the books have sold tremendously well (that's an understatement) and they have been made into films which star the cream of the acting profession. It's not often you get a film which draws on old legends which also includes steam trains and Ford Anglias. Harry Potter has forever altered the way people look at a Ford Anglia. This film, though, is a bit more scary than the first one (in fact the films have got progressively scarier) and the scenes with the basilisk may be a bit too much for small children. I am also a bit arachnophobic (like Ron Weasley) and the scene with the spiders made my flesh creep. But this is still a great film. Although it's a fantasy film, children can still relate to it. When he's not at Hogwarts, Harry lives in a street of Brookside houses, namely Privet Drive. Kids can relate to this setting as it is one many of them will identify with. Many of the children's stories of yore like Peter Pan and the Phoenix and the Carpet had their real world sections in upper class Victorian or Edwardian nurseries, which is just as much a fantasy world for modern kids as Neverland or Narnia. This aspect has also contributed to the success of the Harry Potter books and films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
More coherent than the first,"A clear improvement over the previous film - this is more a story than a sequence of set pieces and the (necessary!) thinning out of the material to reach feature film length was done here much more intelligently.  The first film made the mistake of doing a proportional reduction of the material across the board, leaving too many things in there, and inevitably in a rather underdeveloped state.  This still happens here occasionally, e.g. Harry's trip to Knockturn Alley has been reduced to the point where it contributes so little that it would have been better to cut it altogether, but this is more an exception than the rule.  The final product is still rather long though and thus one might have gone a step further and e.g. ditch the spiders.There were a few occasions at the beginning of the film when I briefly flinched - some characters and set pieces were too visibly introduced to the audience, for instance Mrs Weasley's first referral to Diagon Alley was a little too exuberant to ring true.  I would have transferred that exuberance to Ginny, after all it could (for all we know) her first time there.Compared to the book, the film follows more (perceived) American children's taste, e.g. the irony is toned down (I was disappointed about the omission of the Weasley twins' sarcastic exploitation of Harry's suspected Heir of Slytherin status, although this was perhaps an obvious sacrifice to make) and the level of sentimentality increased, especially in the sugar-coated ending.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Overall a better film than its predecessor, 'Chamber of Secrets' suffers the same way by trying too hard","Watching the 'Harry Potter' film series over again after all these years, in the lead-up to the new installment, I am once again struck by what excellent cinema these stories ought to have made. Movie history is littered with incredible movies made from less-than-stellar source material - 'The Godfather', 'Jaws', 'Psycho', 'The Silence of the Lambs' - none would be considered better than low-brow bestsellers, but the movies that were based on them have become unqualified classics. Maybe because a lot of pulp novels were influenced by cinema, and thus, while short on literary quality, serve quite well as screenplays. Or maybe it's because there is no real pressure on the filmmakers to be true to the source material - changing and 'improving' 'The Godfather' would hardly cause the kind of outrage that mangling Salman Rushdie would.You see what I'm getting at. I don't think J.K. Rowling is a great author, and I don't think she writes great books. I first started reading the Potter books in 2000, as an 8-year-old; and, while I enjoyed them heaps, I wasn't in awe of them, having already read Tolkien and been awed by him instead. But I always thought that the fantastical world of Harry Potter, with its weird creatures and solid, archetypal characters, could be a roaring success on the screen after the manner of Star Wars. And while I didn't know it at the time, in retrospect, I can see why Chris Columbus started off directing the Potter movies - the choice fits with my vision of the series' film fortunes.Except they didn't do it right. Or, rather, they tried to do it too well. The Columbus Potter movies are lamed by a crippling fear of ostracizing Potter aficionados or offending parental sensibilities - they don't dare depict anything other than the most vanilla view of Harry's world. Therefore, for all that the special effects are dazzling, the actors convincing, the story well told, a certain sense of wonder evoked, the lack of panache and palpable self-consciousness of the movies keep them from being a modern Star Wars. They are, to put it bluntly, a bit flat. Which is a real pity, because 'Chamber of Secrets' is the last Potter book with a relatively simple plot that translates easily to screen.The movie takes its time in relating Harry's experiences during his second year at Hogwarts (unlike the first film, however, 'Chamber' doesn't give the viewer much sense of the passage of time; you'd have to read the book to know that the climax takes place at the end of the year), with Quidditch and an underdeveloped house-elf subplot having space to stretch a bit. If 'Chamber' had been directed by Alfonso Cuaron it could have been a magnificent film, as the simplicity of the story that allows Columbus to include little details would have allowed Cuaron to bring his inimitable style to bear upon the picture. As it is, Cuaron directed the next installment, 'Prisoner of Azkaban', which has a labyrinthine plot that becomes muddled rather than amplified by Cuaron's imagination - 'Chamber' would not have suffered in this way.I think it's time I better mention the fact that I still found the movie enjoyable. While overlong and emotionally heavy-handed, it has just the right amount of humor and sinister spookiness to be good fun for all in the mood for well-made frivolity. As is custom with the Potter adaptations, production values and professionalism are never in doubt; the best possible crew has been hired and they do their job well.The casting is, as always, excellent. Along with the returning who's who of British legends from the first movie (the late, great Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, etc.), there are new arrivals in Fiona Shaw and the magnificent Kenneth Branagh - who shamelessly steals every single scene he appears in, even ones with the peerless Alan Rickman. Rickman, of course, is the perfect Snape, exaggerating his stylish wickedness but keeping just enough on this side of pantomime to avoid being ridiculous. I cannot imagine other people find him menacing in the first two movies. He is just great fun.Bizarrely, the child actors are actually not as good in this second movie as their younger selves were in the first. Perhaps they're trying to 'act' too much. Rupert Grint, who was the best of the lot in the first movie, here begins his slide into relative mediocrity - his role consists of making the same horrified nauseous face over and over while rasping in a very high, fearful voice. Watson's Hermione and Radcliffe's Harry improved massively after this movie, which, thankfully, seems no more than a sophomore slump for their acting careers.'Chamber' does have a different tone as compared to 'Stone'. The palette is darker, with Slytherin green (for obvious story reasons) dominating the screen. It is also much scarier than the first, while still retaining the whimsicality - and the innumerable reaction shots of children grinning delightedly that have become Columbus' dubious trademark - that the first film possessed and that made up much of its charm. With no more magical explaining to do the plot is given top priority, and a sinister one it is, too.The world seems to want Harry never to go back to Hogwarts. Mysterious warnings be damned, Harry lands up controversially at school, where cats, ghosts and students alike are being Petrified by an unseen agent - only, Harry is hearing voices. And his strange talents - strange, even for wizards - are becoming public. The heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts - but who could it be? And how can we make the audience get that we hate racial discrimination? Oops. Not quite sure about the last line there.A fun movie, not a masterpiece. Guardedly recommended, if you have three hours to pass.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Even better than the first.,"Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets is everything i expected funnier, darker and scarier and even more magical than the first. It is a great adaption of the book and once again the actors did a terrific job. Everyone was back and even some new ones came in like Colin and Jason Isaac's who portrayed Lucius and play him brilliantly. The whole feel of this film is dark and creepy and the visual effects in it are better than the first and the most creepiest bit for me was the spiders as i am scared to death of them. But this movie is better than the first and i think the only negative thing in the whole movie was Gilderoy Lockhart.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Too long...,"This movie lasted about half an hour too long, imo. There just wasn't enough content to stay captivated the full 2.5+ hours, especially when you've read the books.  Where the first movie could have used an extra half hours, this one is way too thinly stretched.Some examples: - The scene with the potion to hear what Malfoy knew about the curse could have been left out entirely. - There was a serious lack of notion that events where taking place during a school year.  Only small reference was made to following classes and stuff, and the ones that were present mainly had to do with a cure for Petrification and the 'marvelous' Lockhart.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Great sequel, wonderful direction, good screen adaptation.","It's difficult to watch a movie after reading the book without prejudice or bias, so with great trepidation and anticipation I took my family to see the second Harry Potter movie. I loved it! I know it's difficult to include everything in a movie and although I missed a lot of things in the movie, like the denogming and Percy's girlfriend sub-plot, their lack of appearance in the movie didn't take away from the movie plot at all.The attention to detail made it evident that this was Columbus' favorite book and it made for a better movie.

Action-sequel with no thrill.,"Yes, it is indeed a very good movie. Both for movies in general and as a Fantazy Saga. But it has something that is missing or feels incomplete. Why didn't I feel as thrilled as when I watched the first movie? I actually felt a little bit disappointed. I think it has some problems. And the most of it has to do with the rythm of the movie. What I really liked with the first movie was rythm in it. The way it was cut and told was in fact - excellent! The way the characters were introduced, the way of telling the story with the camera which sometime really rested on the pictures. If it was a children's movie or not has nothing to do with if it was good or bad. It was indeed a really excellent handicraft. But this movie lacks the balance of the first one. Even if it is long, I actually think the movie would have been better if they made it even longer! Why? - The story and the characters are not introduced properly. The editing is faster then that in the first one and details which could have been exciting or funny gets lost or actually even destroyed because of this. It feels like that they could have done so much more with everything. In this movie I have no feeling for the characters. Not for the new ones nor even the old ones. Only a stupid owl and a Phoenix gets my sympathy. they were indeed the best with this movie!Another problem is the one of all sequels. This movie rely too much on the first one. Old jokes and ingredients have already past the ""best before date"". Why didn't they concentrate on the original stuff and characters in the second book? Now the result becomes only ""so so"". This means that if you haven't seen the old one, you can not see this one. You are not properly introduced. And if you see the second first, you also destroy the jokes in the first one. If you have seen the first one, you will feel disappointed on this one.They tried to do an action-sequel. It is still a good movie but it failed in its intentions. Because of the lack of originality and the fact that the team did a better movie before this one, if I had to be the judge, I can only give this movie a 7 out of 10. Sad, yes . . . But you still have to go and see it!",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

I will wait for it to come out on video so I can fast forward or turn it off when I like, which judging by the first two movies won't be long after it starts.Harry Potter will be FORGOTTEN in the next 10 years thanks to these movies, Thank goodness for The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, A fantasy movie that even with one movie released has become a MASTERPIECE.

"Not as good as the first, but still good","I commented on the first HP movie ages ago, without having read the books. Now that I've become totally addicted to them, I just have a little to say about this.As my summary says, it's not as good as the first, but it's still good. The story is exciting and the special effects are great. Rowling's world is beautifully recreated and the story is enjoyable.I spoke about the actors in my other review, but, being now familiar with the characters from the books, I can offer a more rounded view.Daniel Radcliffe IS Harry Potter. There's no doubt in my mind. The producer who discovered him for the role said he felt as though Radcliffe had a very old soul, and I agree. Harry seems to me to have the same trait. I'm glad Daniel will play Harry in the Goblet of Fire. I'm quite enjoying watching him grow up actually.I was disappointed to hear that Tom Felton won't play Draco in film 4. The scene in the Slytherin common room was just great. He was so icy and menacing in the way he said ""As for me, I hope it's Granger"".And again, Richard Harris will be missed. I really hope Michael Gambon (another Irishman, you may not have known) does a good job in The Prisoner of Azkaban, which I'm really looking forward to. Book 3 is my favourite, so I hope they did it justice.And it's nice to see that the title wasn't changed to suit certain audiences this time around. Let's keep it that way, shall we?",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Better than the fantastic original.,"My Take: A fantastic special effects-laden adventure that's better than the original. One of the best in the series.While I read only few parts from THE SORCERER'S STONE, I even read less in the second chapter in the series, HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS. But, like the original, this adaption doesn't harm viewers that didn't read the book before purchasing the ticket. It's very faithful to the novel like the first film, but what a surprise! This is better than the original. While its heavy faithfulness leaves less room for surprises, this one has more cinematic edge. The action scenes are more exciting, and the magical sequences are more spellbinding than ever. Fans have no doubt enjoyed it, and who am I to disagree. I loved this movie, and it may just become a favorite.For the story, I suggest you read the book instead. There's few point in writing a summary if most of you already know what it's about. I will point out the finest scenes and plot points. While this is just as filled with special effects as the first film, these effects are just as imaginative. Although the goal is to make them more magical than the effects in the first film, they haven't left the imagination behind. The wonder is there also. In sequences with the special effects, they're made more believable by the presence of wonder and awe. There's also excitement of the high order. Even if you have read the book, the thrills will get to you. Sequences like when Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and Ron (Rupert Grint) are chased by giant spiders, riding a flying car, battling a legendary killer Basilisk is especially exciting and thrilling.Once again, there's also good acting. The all-star supporting cast are back, with the addition of Kenneth Branagh as the boastful Gilderoy Lockhart and Miriam Margolyes as one of the new professors. The younger actors, including Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson (once again, the best of the bunch) and others, are back, and since they're growing up, their acting skills got even better. The screenplay is faithful, and although it's faithful to the book from cover to cover as possible, there are still a lot of surprises here and there. The production design and costumes are dazzling. Director Chris Colombus, who has worked with Steven Spielberg before (GREMLINS), has certainly learned much to give the series just the same amount of wonder, excitement and humor the way Spielberg himself could have done it.HARRY POTTER & THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS is darker, edgier and better than the first film, and you know that's saying something since I liked the first film a lot. This is in my opinion the best in the series so far, tied with the next chapter in the series HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Totally amazing...,"The film has been (finally !) released in France today... Fan of Mrs. Rowling's books, I just came from the theater and I'm really not disappointed !!

Daniel Radcliffe (oh my god this little boy has so much talent !), Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are completely fantastic... They've really grown up ! Tom Felton (Draco), Jason Issacs (Lucius Malfoy), Kenneth Branagh (Gilderoy Lockhart), Alan Rickman (Snape), Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid), Richard Harris (Dumbledore)... had made a great work too.

Beats LOTR hands down,"Having read all the HP books and seen The Philosopers Stone, I was really excited by the new film, and expected it to be good. I wasn't disappointed. It was BRILLIANT. This film is more action packed, exciting, and funnier then the first film, with the wonderful child stars giving more confident performances. Daniel Radclife, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson have really settled into their roles nicely, and the adult cast are too, terrific. Kenneth Brannah almost steals the show as the hilarious Gilderoy Lockhart. The showdown at the end is tense and exciting, and even though I'd read the book I still gasped in several places. The flying car and Dobby are just some of the brilliant CGI effects, and the Qudditch match is fast and furious. Just beware if you don't like spiders as theres one in there that would make any one with agrophobia faint!As too all these comparions to LOTR, I liked LOTR's very much, and will be going to see The Two Towers, but the HP films are so much more fun, and magical. They really touch the child in you. OK so LOTR scooped an Oscar or two, but when it comes to public affection, it's Harry whos literally on the money.

Decent Sequel,First of all If you watched the first one there's no doubt that you won't watch this one and secondly if you watch this you'll surely like this as well.

The acts have done well as per earlier and undoubtedly its again a treat for us. I just believe that it could have been edited and made a bit short. Anyways the movie is really good and its a must.

"Passable thanks to some good casting and improved special effects, but it's a slight step down from ""The Sorcerer's Stone.""","I will give Chris Columbus this much: he succeeded in making a 2.5 hour film feel 30 minutes long. Never while watching ""The Chamber of Secrets"" did I feel bored or impatient, as one scene after another fired away with the latest revelation of the ""Harry Potter"" universe. Yet as the picture went on it didn't feel like it was adding up to a whole lot. For all of the events and discoveries that occur within the film, the direction feels less inspired, the script feels less assured, and for all of the horrors that are occurring within the school, there doesn't always seem to be a whole lot of jeopardy. That takes away from what could have been a massively entertaining epic.This film picks up right where #1 left off. Harry is having a miserable time with the Dursleys, and to make matters even more confusing for him, he receives a strange visit from a house-elf named Dobby (well voiced by Toby Jones) that he mustn't attend Hogwarts because if he does, his life will be in danger. Harry manages to escape and get to school anyway (although very unconventionally), but as soon as he arrives, a series of strange events begin to occur immediately. When some students begin getting attacked by an unknown monster, Harry quickly turns into a prime suspect, and he, Ron, and Hermione work relentlessly to track down the culprit.I mentioned Toby Jones earlier, and that brings me to some great casting choices this film has. First off, Jones brings an honest, well-intentioned, earnestness to Dobby, which is a very good thing, considering that Dobby could have been easily portrayed as annoying. Also inspired (and quite funny) is Kenneth Branagh as the self-centered and incompetent Defense against the Dark Arts Teacher, Gilderoy Lockhart. Then you've also got Jason Issacs as the icy Lucius Malfoy (he holds back no contempt against Harry Potter and Arthur Weasley), Julie Walters and Mark Williams as the endearing Mrs. and Mr. Weasley, and Christian Coulson as the power hungry Tom Riddle. And don't forget the good retentions from the first film, including Tom Felton still relishing his role as the snarky Draco Malfoy and Robbie Coltrane holding strong as the semi-father figure Rubeus Hagrid.Although those performances shine, some others don't. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, nor Emma Watson are a whole lot better here than they were in film #1. Part of that problem is because the script by Steven Kloves doesn't feel as sharp. He doesn't seem to build up to the sense of jeopardy the school is in as well as he did previously. Okay, he didn't do it terrifically then either, but at least it was better. Too many scene transitions feel abrupt as well. And the revelation on who opened the Chamber of Secrets doesn't pack nearly the punch that it should because the person at fault is underdeveloped.Adding to that, Chris Columbus's direction feels less inspired. In the first film, he had an honest interest in the world of ""Harry Potter,"" and was keen to reveal all of its wonders. Here, he seems stuck on that mode, when the story calls for more ""sinister"" direction. Hogwarts still feels like a warm, confiding place to be (although the picture tone is a little yellower and drier than in the previous film), and the sense that something awful is trying to emerge from underneath doesn't get through.I also recall saying in my previous review that had it not been for John Williams' film score, it would have been a 7, not an 8. Well, in this film, there felt like there was too little of his wonderful music. There's nothing wrong with silent scenes, per say, but when the script and direction aren't always good and you don't have great music to listen to anyway, something feels lacking.Is anything better? Yes. The special effects are more polished this time around. The best example comes during the Quidditch game. The movements by the students on their brooms feel far more realistic this time, or at least, as realistic as you could possibly make Quidditch. Before, they felt jerky and computer animated. Now, they feel gradual and human calculated. You get a feel for the turn of direction, the maneuvering through the underground barristers, and the resistance of air at any given point. Also well realized are Dobby the house elf (not quite Gollum-realistic but still well-integrated into the scene), the Weasleys' flying car, and the monster in the film's final battle. These were improved despite a small slashing to the budget.Do I recommend ""The Chamber of Secrets""? For the most part, yes. There's too much talent around for the film to go wrong, and some select scenes (the Quidditch match and the climax, for example) work terrifically well. But overall, this simply does not feel as fresh as ""The Sorcerer's Stone,"" or as good. Let's hope that, by the time part 2 of ""The Deathly Hallows"" rolls around, this will remain the weakest ""Harry Potter"" film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Series doesn't disappoint.,"This second movie in the Harry Potter series keeps going at a great rate. It continues to impress me how a 160 minute movie can act like its 20 minutes.  I just want more.  It's like, hey, don't end now.  I was having fun.  The entertainment in this movie is off the scale and I think this is why people love it.  I loved to poke fun at Harry originally.  (when it was just a book)  But after having religious fantatics crying foul, I had to go for it.  So now I own all the books, the first movie and now I've watched this one.  And the score is beginning to interest me. o_OOne this this is guarrantied to do....  is make you happy. :)10/10Quality: 8/10 Entertainment: 14/10 Replayable: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Been there done that,"I went to see this movie with expectations of it being even better than the first film.  Granted sequels are never as good as the original in most cases, but with this film coming under as much fan scrutiny as any film in history has, I would have expected the film to be better.  It was very good, don't get me wrong, maybe some of the magic was taken away because I had read the book first unlike when I had seen the first one in which I had not read the book.The acting was decent, but I had this recurring image of Richard Harris having died before the release of the film and I was thinking about that during much of the movie.  Watching him onscreen he seemed feeble and ailing even during the movie and it left me wondering if maybe a different actor should have played him considering what ultimately happened.Overall, I was somewhat disappointed with the film and I can only hope that since there will be a longer time until the third film is made that there will be ample time for the producers of the new film to improve on a series that is of quality but needs some more spicing up to improve on the original film which in and of itself was very entertaining.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The lamest movie so far this year!,"Unlike the first film, I saw this movie in the theatre and I wanted my seven dollars back at the end.  I haven't read the books so I really can't say that the movies are lame because of it.  I found the movies lame because it was too neatly pressed and cleaned up for this sort of  film regardless that they were based on previously written material.  According to what I have heard, the books are loaded with great dialogue and sarcastic and witty commentary.  Both films were devoid of those aspects.  Some found the films funny and I didn't find them such.  The plot could have been written too fit an hour and a half as opposed to one and a half days.  The subject of witchcraft is not one that entices me either.  The few redeeming qualities of this movie are the performance of Jason Isaacs and the darkness and dankness of the Hogwarts setting (the art direction was brilliant). Overall, this is the longest and lamest film of 2002.  I give this dumb film 3 out of 10!Here ends my rant!",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
If in doubt: Avoid this film.,"If, like me, you found the first film no more than okay-ish, then you will fine The Chamber of Secrets suicide inducing. The acting is no better, perhaps even worse, than it was in the original film, any magical feeling has been lost, and JK Rowling replaced the original villain, Snape, with a scary voice and a big spider, who are most definitely not fit to shine Alan Rickman's cool capey thing.Every aspect of this story is easily predictable. The film even resorts to word puns that are actually worse than 'What's brown and sticky?'If you are looking for a fantasy epic, or something to treat your children, do not see this film. If you are looking for something simple to mildly entertain you, save your cash by collecting some annoying stage school children and telling them to harass a spider for a few hours while you go and watch another film.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

"Not as good as the first, but the magic is still there.","The first two movies are the ones that do the best keeping to the original magical world created by JK Rowling. This one is very accurate with the first one, I really feel like after the first two the movies go into completely different directions as new directors come in and the set is continuously changed. This is also that last one with the great Richard Harris in it, sadly.However, though it is very true to the books as well as the first movie, the story has not yet gotten into the darkness and huge plot-it's still just a story of kids getting into trouble and finding adventures at school. Also this book was my least favorite of the series, not for any particular reason other than there just wasn't much to it.Still, not to be missed, and the story only gets better from here.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

The journey continues,"The first sequel to ""Harry Potter"" is absolutely fantastic, far better than the original one. Or, I should say, despite some uneven pace and tone of the film, it is much more three- dimensional and complex, giving us what we want: theills of fantasy. Harry Potter is in the second year at Hogwarts, and now is ready to go back to the school, in spite of the advice given by strange creature called Dobby, who shows up before him to warn that very bad things would happen if Harry goes back. But Harry ignores his warnings anyway, and starts his new year at the school, only to find weird occasions that remind him of Dobby's words. And finally, he is to know that ""The Chamber of Secrets,"" about which no one (including the teachers) knows -- its existence, its location, and its terrifying secrets -- is opened by someone inside of the place, and students start to fall victims to it. Can Harry stop the danger, and regain the peace for the school? The premise seems similar to that of the original film, but the overall tone of the film gets darker and more sinister. It is possible that some of the pre-teen kids might find the film too scary at some time (especially they don't like slugs, spiders and snakes), and perhaps adults find it the same way. Don't underestimate the film's dark elements any more. But the most remarkable thing about ""Chamber of Secrets"" is its hugely improved CGIs, reflecting the filmmaker's confidence coming from the commercial success of the previous one. The match of Quiddich is again used as one of the highlights, and the newer game scene is simply great, much better than the first one. With enhanced sound effects, the fight between Harry and Malfoy looks more realistic, even frightening, flying all over the ground and stands (and unbelievably, under them). The only weak point is its new character Dobby, created all by CGIs, which still looks unnatural sometimes. Moreover, in the opening sequence, the film attempts to get laughs using Dobby not so effectively, making him a bit irritating creature like Jar-Jar Binks or Scooby-Doo. But wait a while, and see Ron's family is introduced, including ever delightful Julie Walters (""Billy Elliot"") as Ron's mother. Another new character is given by Kenneth Branagh as Gilderoy Lockhart, a new teacher (and a celebrity) at Hogwarts. Obviously he is a comic relief, and Branagh is surprisingly good, this time not resorting to his overacting tendency that destroyed Woody Allen's ""Celebrity."" And don't miss the brief scene after the end credit roll. Daniel Radcliffe is as good as before, and so is Rupert Grint (in fact, they are giving the best acting in the film), but most regrettable is Emma Watson's Hermione, who is given much shorter time on the screen. All the actors are good, but their presence seems to be rather sacrificed to establish darker images of the school. So, John Cleese is allowed to speak very briefly only twice, and even Maggie Smith and Allen Rickman are not allotted enough time to impress us. You brink your eye, and you will miss Fiona Shaw! It is, however, undeniable that the film went through great improvement, and it explores much darker side of magic, which gives more thrills to adults and children alike. But how will they keep this pace in the future? Is it possible to combine evil elements with the concept of family picture? That is my only concern, and the second sequel would show the answer.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Better than the first,"Although ""Chamber"" is better than the first Potter movie, I enjoyed the first more. Not to say that this new installment wasn't enjoyable, I just like the plot better in the first.Now about ""Chamber of Secrets."" The special effects were much better done in this one, and even more important the 3 kids (Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson) turned in much better performances than the last film. However the biggest difference was in Columbus' directing which was almost flawless this time as he crammed in even more detail. I can't wait to see how ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" will turn out since that is more complex, and it has three Quidditch games that are important to the plot.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

The Kiddies Stuff the Ballot Boxes,"Inferior to the first film in many respects except for action. Unfortunately there is very little character development and the film focuses itself on a tortured, twisted plot. Puberty has not been kind to the actors, especially Harry, who now speaks in a very deep voice.No question that the character development is the enjoyable element of the first movie that is so sorely lacking here. Yes, great CGI but nothing beyond it. The huge number that rated this a perfect 10 here are either kiddies or ballot stuffers. You will be disappointed. The movie is entertaining but drags on for over 2 and a half hours. Harry wonders why Hagrid mentions to go somewhere and then after they do, you'll begin to wonder the same. Bad pacing, bad flow.Worth seeing? Perhaps as there is a lot of shlock playing now. But don't expect a great film -- this isn't one. While it no longer is an ""intro"" to the Harry Potter series, this one suffers from the focus on CGI rather than good moviemaking. Good video rental and a film if there isn't anything else playing, but not a must see.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The little wizard casts his spell,"Few book-to-film adaptations retain the original gusto of the novel, but this is one of the rare exceptions that proves it can be done. The Chamber of Secrets manages to hit all the high points that made the novel a bestseller. Die-hard fans will delight in the fact that their favorite book passages are almost all accounted for, from the Polyjuice Potion to the famous Wizard's Duel (a personal favorite scene of mine).The storyline is fairly easy to follow, and the visual dynamics much improved over ""The Sorcerer's Stone."" It's an excellent adaptation and an exciting adventure that pits good against evil in a powerful showdown.Â All of our favorite characters are back again for a second term at Hogwarts.Â Daniel Radcliffe and Tom Felton have beautifully conformed to their roles as Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy. It's fantastic to see how these kids have grown, both physically and talent-wise. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are both memorable as Ron and Hermione. Grint in particular has some of the best lines in the film. Some of the best delights, however, come from the adult cast. Alan Rickman, while seriously underused, is deliciously sinister as the infamous Professor Snape, Kenneth Branagh makes a believable and over-the-top Professor Lockhart, and Jason Isaacs is ideal for the villainous Lucius Malfoy.There's also a delightfully creepy house-elf named Dobby, a few befuddled owls, and a tree with a bad temper. It's a wonderful, swift-moving, imaginative film with a lot of wonderful lessons for children to take heed of -- including prejudice, and choosing between right and wrong.

Tops Sorcerer's Stone Indefinately,"RATING: 10 out of 10Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the best fantasy movie to date. Suspenseful, funny, and intriguing, Chamber of Secrets is twice as good as the Sorcerer's Stone. All roles are played expertly - exactly as you would picture them if you've read the story, which is just as good. Chris Columbus was the perfect choice of directors for this movie, being as how faithful the movie is to its written version. Steven Kloves stayed very true to the story-line, along with help from J.K. Rowling herself.The actors and actresses of this movie have improved greatly in their acting skills, specificly Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson, who have come a long way since Sorcerer's Stone. The special effects of Chamber of Secrets are superb, especially in the final showdown against the Basilisk and in the Gryffindor/Slytherin Quidditch match. For any Potter fan, it's a must have.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Much better than the first one,"Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets - the much anticipated sequel to the 2001 blockbuster Harry Potter and the philosophers stone, in my view, is exceptionally better; better in every department, compared to the last one.I have not read any of the books, so the entire concept of Harry Potter was very new to me.The first instalment of Harry Potter did not impress me a great deal. I had found the screenplay too weak, the characters lacking, and the acting - unprofessional. Most damaging however, was the overall childish feel of it. However the chamber of secrets improves upon each of the aforementioned aspects; quite considerably.This time around, Harry finds himself at the epicentre of a sinister conspiracy to kill/rid all the non-wizard children. Legend has it, that there is chamber in the building, a chamber that houses a creature of immense evil. Someone has opened the chamber and unleashed the demonic creature behind it. The creature is loose in the school, petrifying non-wizards(that are semi-human) leaving its victims inanimate and frozen. The future of the school is in danger and our young wizard Harry and his friends have to solve the mystery of the chamber of secrets to save the school and put an end to this creature.The plot unveils like a puzzle that pieces together gradually and slowly, but not without many doses of charm, absolutely outstanding special effects and light and delighting comedy. However, though negligible in the grande scheme of things, the near 3 hour length of the film and the dozens of plot devices can impede on the film sometimes.. Thankfully, the editing is very fluid, so much of the length does not register.Special effects, as mentioned before, are outstanding and present in abundance throughout the length of the film. There is little footage, where CGI is not implemented. One sequence worth a special mention, is the jaw-dropping game scene, which is quite literally a white knuckle ride.Technical credits are outstanding. I can predict Harry Potter will garner many technical Oscar nominations this year. Cinematography is awe inducing. The director of photography makes excessive use of aerial cinematography. Frequently The camera gracefully descends from very high into the opening of a window. The lighting, which was also striking in the latter version, is again exceptional. Lighting the interiors and exteriors with a barrage of simulated natural lighting. Set pieces are also excellent. Sound and music are thrilling.Performances are good. Daniel(Harry Potter) has developed his acting skills considerably - relative to the previous. The supporting cast also show some improvement.In totality: Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets, is something children all over the world, and us adults, should be proud of.Rating: 9/10(Excellent)Review By Raj",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Great continuation of the Potter Saga...,"This film does a great job of expanding the wizarding world of Harry Potter, without trying to outreach itself.

One thing is certain there are more secrets and hidden parts of Hogwarts to be found, and I am sure during the remaining series we will find out more about it!This film doesn't quite carry the wonder of the first film quite as much, but it does introduce us to new parts of the school, new characters and expand the world within which it is set, without trying to do too much and overwhelm us.Can't wait to watch the next one...",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Second Potter film takes a needed leap in maturity,"The first Harry Potter movie was kind of like a freak-out test for its creators: how much material do we use from the book? How loyal do we stay to it? How do we make this all come to life? ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"" the film version of the second book in the fantasy series by J.K Rowling, shows less concern with these questions. Director Chris Columbus and his crew operate much more like a team that's been here before, that knows the fantasy world it has created and how to make it better. Not to mention the material is a shade darker, the kids another year older (which at 12-13 makes a big difference) and the special effects light years better in comparison to the last years' ""Sorcerer's Stone.""""Sorcerer's Stone"" was sort of a childish family film, one worried about being too scary, whose major merits came merely from book-lovers' excitement to see what was stuck in their heads come to life on the big screen -- something its creators could bank on. Now that the Harry Potter world has been imagined once before, the trial period is over and Columbus and adapter Steve Kloves must really put themselves to the test. They definitely succeed: ""Chamber of Secrets"" is much more thrilling and visually complex, enough so to steal our minds from some of the story flaws that bled over from the first film (something all future Potter films will endure).""Chamber of Secrets"" is inherently a richer story -- a mystery where death lurks at every turn and Hogwarts school, the wizarding school which Harry attends, is in imminent danger. When Harry arrives at school for his second year, students begin turning up petrified as word gets out that the legendary chamber of secrets, said to contain a monster, has been opened. It's still a fantasy side venture that avoids the looming conflict between Harry and the great evil wizard who killed his parents, Lord Voldemort, but there's a lot more at stake than the first story. Maybe it was unavoidable for Columbus to respond with a film more capable of frightening young children, but whereas a silly troll that might as well have been Shrek attacked Hogwarts last time, ""Chamber of Secrets"" loads up on creepy giant spiders that attack Harry and Ron, and Columbus doesn't hold back. Thank goodness.More UK all-stars join the cast this time around such as Kenneth Branagh as the new -- and foolishly egotistical -- defense against the dark arts teacher Gilderoy Lockhart and Jason Isaacs plays a sinister looking Lucius Malfoy, father of Draco, Harry's arch schoolyard nemesis. More notably are the improvements in the nucleus trio of Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson. Watson sheds some touching tears as Hermione, but the most improved award goes to Grint. He was adorable in ""Socerer's Stone,"" but now he's progressed to being a goofy, klutzy character that commands much more of the screen.A much more exciting story awaits those who haven't read the books or were not so impressed by ""Sorcerer's Stone."" Kloves' script still crams a bit too much, but nothing goes in that doesn't progress the mystery plot or deliver some sort of imaginative CGI sequence from flying cars to magical creatures. That's at least an improvement over the last film. We also have a clearly defined lesson for Harry to learn as he begins his maturing process. There's a definite sense of his growth.A tip of the hat goes to a crew that learned enough the first time around to make great improvements to the second edition. This is more the young adult demographic that these movies need to hit on.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Can it get any worse?,"Wizarding is not an easy thing to do, that's for sure. And in a way, film-making is a kind of wizardry, as the director conjures images thought and un-thought of. However, it's not enough to delight on a visual level, the feast must also contain a story well enough patched together (especially considering the long Harry Potter books) and at least decent performances from the actors. Hard thing to do, it seems.I hoped to see something better than ""The Sorcerer's Stone"", judging that people tend to learn from mistakes. Of course, that was naive from me. The action kind of kept jumping from one scene to another, without really much connection between them (not a great screenplay by Kloves). The biggest hole in plotting would be at the end, when Dumbledore says something...rather weird, if you have not read the book. Something like ""No exams will be held"", which the normal movie goer while grasp as natural and had it been our world, I'd have agreed. The natural state of things have to be clearly defined, so as to wholly integrate the world you're trying to pick up from the books in its own universe. Besides Columbus' lack of inspiration, I have to underline the fact that the teens were as bad as in the first. I did not like any of them except, maybe, Rupert Grint and I only liked him in some scenes (like the spiders-scene). The only change at Radcliffe was in his voice, definitely not his acting. Felton wasn't great either, but he's decent enough while playing Malfoy's part. It's also somewhat easier, considering his minutes in the film. The ""big"" actors, on the other hand, are very fine, no complaints against them. Isaacs is good for father Malfoy and Kenneth Branagh portrays Lockhart just perfectly!What I liked most was Dobby! Though he was not how I imagined him, he was brilliantly animated, and brought with him a bit of fun to the long, sometimes boring portrayal of Harry's second Hogwarts year. Other visual effects? The basilisk was cool enough to satisfy my needs for bloodthirsty creatures. It's really unfortunate that Columbus, a decent guy, couldn't scrap up something better than last time, but I guess it's not only his fault. Working with kids can be quite hard, I imagine and books remain books as movies always try to become...more.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
An Enchanting Journey into the Chamber of Secrets,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a magical continuation of the beloved wizarding world created by J. K. Rowling.

"Harry Potter's Second Adventure Holds Up, But Lacks the Magic of the First","As a sequel to the first Harry Potter movie, Chamber of Secrets delivers a fun and engaging adventure in the magical world of Hogwarts. The film follows Harry and his friends as they investigate the mysterious Chamber of Secrets, where a monster has been released and is attacking students at the school.One of the strengths of Chamber of Secrets is the way it continues to build upon the worldbuilding established in the first film. We get to explore more of Hogwarts and the wider wizarding world, including the introduction of new magical creatures and spells. The production design and visual effects continue to be impressive, creating a sense of wonder and enchantment that draws viewers into the story.However, the film also has some shortcomings, particularly in its pacing and script. At times, the plot feels rushed and the transitions between scenes are abrupt, which can make it difficult to fully immerse oneself in the story. Additionally, some of the dialogue and character interactions can come across as stilted or forced, which detracts from the overall experience.That being said, the performances from the cast are generally strong. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint continue to embody their roles as Harry, Hermione, and Ron, respectively, and their chemistry and friendship remains a highlight of the film. Supporting performances from actors like Kenneth Branagh and Alan Rickman also add depth and complexity to the story.Overall, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a solid sequel that expands upon the magical world of Hogwarts and delivers an entertaining adventure. While the pacing and script may not be perfect, the film's worldbuilding and strong performances make it a worthwhile watch for fans of the Harry Potter franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A wizard movie with no magic.,"This is a profoundly unsatisfying film.  The story is inexplicablyweak.  In movies of this ilk, usually there's a clash between Goodand Evil that culminates in a scene where you root for Good toblow up Evil's deathstar.Not so here.  Instead, Harry's a weak wizard who keeps gettingrescued by others.  The last, interminable, hour has Harry beingdirected into a spider's nest by a supposed friend.  All looks darkuntil A MIRACULOUS FLYING CAR saves his ass.  Okay, so nowwe hate the supposed friend, and wait to see how the supposedfriend is in league with the bad guy Malfoy, right?  Wrong.  Instead,the climactic scene is between Harry and a just-introduced giantsnake.  All looks bleak for Harry until a MIRACULOUS FLYINGBIRD comes to save his ass and flies away.  Harry now has thestrength to fight the snake.  But as he kills the snake, he's injured.He's gonna die.  All looks over until THE MIRACULOUS FLYINGBIRD comes back a second time and saves his ass all  overagain. You don't expect it can get much worse, until the last scene, in thedining hall, when all the kids give a huge STANDING OVATION tothe supposed friend that sent Harry into the spider's nest.  But waita second, supposed friend is a minor character and a betrayer toboot.  Why would everyone applaud him while beaming like idiots?And why would sappy music come in?

It had the same dark atmosphere the second book had. The Chamber of Secrets looked eerie and the scene between Harry with Harry speaking Parseltongue at the dueling club was awesome. Not to mention the superb casting. Tom Riddle looked just as handsome and evil as I imagined him to be, the movies Gilderoy Lockhart matched the one from the book, and Jason Isaac's was a perfect choice for the elder Malfoy.Overall a great film.

I loved the ghosts, monsters, and violence and I would rate this an R for scariness, not a PG-13.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Good Mystery.,"Review:
'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' is a fantasy film directed by Chris Columbus. It is based on J. K. Rowling's novel of the same name and is the second instalment in the Harry Potter film series.
This movie is said to be the worst in the series. I really don't consider that to be the case. I enjoyed this movie for what it is, a mystery film.
Its story follows Harry Potter's (Daniel Radcliffe) second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as the Heir of Salazar Slytherin opens the Chamber of Secrets, unleashing a monster that petrifies the school's denizens.
The acting is miles ahead of where it was in the first movie. Many of the original cast return and a few new characters appear in this such as Kenneth Branagh and Jason Isaacs, who are great additions to the cast. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are still not fully into their prime yet, but still put on good performances.
The runtime is a bit long, and some of the elements get lost throughout, but the overall story is entertaining and keeps you engaged. I also enjoy the mystery element that this movie brings. Finding out who opened the Chamber of Secrets and finding out who Gilderoy Lockhart actually is.
Overall, it doesn't have the nostalgia of the first one, but still holds up in the franchise.

Don't let the differences between the Book and Movie deter you.,Yes there are differences in the movie.  There will always be differences in these cases.  Both are great in their own areas.  The movie does capture the feeling of Harry Potter even though some parts of the book were omitted. Having read the books and eating them up I can say that the books offer more insight into the larger part of psychology that is developed into the characters.  The movie however does a wonderful job at depicting action sequences that normally are a little harder to imagine that are closer to the authors depiction. The movie was great and entertaining and certainly didn't feel it's length. It moves fast enough to keep the interest quota filled.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Worthy, But Still Suffers From Loyalty","Chris Columbus managed to bring the world of Harry Potter to the big screen with success in The Sorcerer's Stone. Now, Columbus returns to direct the second Harry Potter movie, Chamber of Secrets. After watching the movie it's safe to say that it has improved upon the first Potter movie but still falls in areas.The deal in Chamber of Secrets is that Harry tries to go back to Hogwarts for another year at school but encounters a house elf who is unwilling to let him go. This leads to Harry's rescue from the Weasley brothers and a real intro to the Weasley family. By the time Harry does get back to Hogwarts he has a lot to deal with, as if the troubles to get there weren't enough. Mysterious things happen to students at Hogwarts that is connected to the Chamber of Secrets being opened. From there on, the movie keeps a good feeling of interest for the audience to keep everything go nicely.Chamber of Secrets is more serious than that of Sorcerer's Stone and is a darker film. But there isn't anything in this movie that should haunt the youngsters until they're teenagers. While the darker mood isn't used to great effect it does help keep the movie going, and very smoothly at that. There's also a bit of real action in this movie, just a bit though. The Quidditch match is more in-your-face than the last and the scene in the Chamber of Secrets has a bit of an edge-of-your-seat way to it that actually works well.The acting in Chamber of Secrets is improved from Sorcerer's Stone, but marginally only. Yes, the trio has matured since Sorcerer's Stone and it does show, part thanks to Radcliffe's deeper voice. Even with the acting being just slightly better than that of the first it's not a bad thing. In fact, under the circumstances of most Hollywood sequels, this a good thing, as each person in the movie leaves the same good effect as before. A bit of maturity doesn't go a long way here, but at least it shows.From start to finish, Chamber of Secrets is a worthy sequel that manages to be better than the first in every way. However, the movie is plagued by the extreme loyalty to the book. This also creates problems for the young performers in the movie and it does show. But anyone that has a good taste for movies should be able to find at least one way to enjoy Chamber of Secrets.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002) - There's a Freaking House Elf Protecting Me!,"The second installment of the hit phenomenon involves house elves, giant lizards, a secret chamber, petrified attacks, and let's not forget that the movie is an excellent sequel to the hit movie that will define a generation of magical wonders. Now, I thought the movie was really cool of it's new plot and characters, and let's not forget that the cinematography, music, and effects is excellent like always. And the new characters including Dobby the House Elf, Tom Riddle, Gilderoy Lockhart, and Lucius Malfoy were all quite excellent in every way, and Chris Columbus' direction was exactly magical just like the first movie. And it has a script that has everything involving big surprises and mind-twisting scenes. Well, I guess this movie was as unique as the first movie, and it was pretty cool as well. Now, we are bringing the magic back, baby! ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"", in my review, ""a magical sequel, and a unique charm to the series"".",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Phenomenal Film!!,"Absolutely phenomenal film with great philosophical messages, acting, directing, producing, etc. It is a renowned and fantastic film! I highly recommend this film to everyone!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Leaves you with about as much to think about as a trip to the circus.,"A typically female, airy-fairy story - all window decoration and no real edge or power to it. Yes, if I was 8 or 9, I'd have loved this film. But I'm an adult who loves films like Toy Story, The Wizard Of Oz, The Grinch... because these films actually give you something to chew on.The Harry Potter stories are a wash of pastel-shaded, girly frills (and thrills); totally unscary and unmoving.And the stories are so badly constructed. I thought that if a decent screenwriter got hold of the HP series, he could fashion a decent structure from the amateurish rubbish produced by Rowling.But look at the cash come in.Two bits of British nonsense topping the US charts. Ha! (Let's face it - Bond movies died about two weeks into the preproduction of Moonraker - or before)",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The magic continues,"It has been done again. A masterpiece has been made.Right from the off it is obvious that a dark atmosphere is beginning to take hold of the story. The three main characters are just hitting adolescence and death is becoming more of an issue.The acting is just as superb and the three young leads have improved greatly. As with the last movie all the other characters are portrayed superbly, Dumbuldore especially.I think I should note that for me the Basalisk is the most beautifully designed creatures in the series so far. Unlike some of the other creatures such as the werewolf in Prisinor of Azkaban and Fluffy.As I said this film is a masterpiece just as the other films are and should be on the Top 250 board.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Chamber of Secrets Is Open For Business!!!,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is an incredible adaptation of JK Rowling's second book. In it, we're introduced to some new characters: Dobby the house elf, an enjoyable creature who wants nothing more than to help Harry; Moaning Myrtle, a hysterical and morbid ghost of a teenage girl who wants nothing more than to share a toilet with Harry; Gilderoy Lockhart, a moronic and grinning teacher who wants nothing more than to steal the spotlight from Harry. and Lucius Malfoy, a devilish adult who wants nothing more than to hurt Harry. The movie continues to expand on the world of magic introduced in Sorcerer's Stone and adds an incredible storyline to it all. The story is significantly better than Sorcerer's Stone and one of the most clever in the entire series to date. The kids seem to be more comfortable in their roles now and the adults continues with their brilliance, but I must admit, it doesn't seem like any of these adult British actors have the capacity to be bad actors. Lots of new and imaginative magical items make their introduction in this film in exhilarating fashion: Polyjuice Potion, Riddle's Diary, Aragog and much, much more. The film, like the first, still lacks edginess, but that's fine, because so does the book, and I see nothing wrong with sticking to the books, especially when the books are so good and after all, these movies are made for the readers more than the casual moviegoers. I don't mind creative licensing here or there, but stick with the elements that make the book good, and the movie will be good too. Terribly clever, great cinematography, enjoyable performances and much more make this installment into the Harry Potter series a gem.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Huge Improvement,"I give this one a 7 out of 10. It was a huge improvement over ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone"" ( Which I gave a merciful 5 out of 10 ). This movie wasn't geared totally towards kids like the first one was. I was impressed by the special effects. I was also impressed as to just how dark they let it get. I can actually say I enjoyed it. There were some moments in the film were it seemed to regress back to the childishness of the first film,but it seemed to always recover itself. Overall a pretty solid movie. At least worth a rental.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Good but not perfect like the rest.,"This is the an o.k. movie but I expected more of it like it was in Harry Potter and the philosophers stone and Harry Potter Prizoner of Azkaban. I am still glad that this film won 7 awards.Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe)gets a visit by an house elf (Voice of Toby Jones) that warns him not to go to Hogwarts because something bad is about to happen which it definitely is.Harry Potter,Ronald Weasly (Rupert Grint) and Hermoine (Emma Watson)try to solve the case of the chamber of secrets who has been opened by Rons little sister Ginny (Bonny Wright)because she was persuaded to do it by Tom Riddle (Christian Coulson) and Harry Potter Potter solves ti by himself.This movie was good.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Another victory in adaptation.,"Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) returns to his miserable home with the Dursleys after his adventures at Hogwarts during his first year. Before returning, he is warned of great danger at Hogwarts by a house elf named Dobby. He is urged not to go, but Harry is anxious to return back to the only place in which he finds happiness.Upon returning, Harry meets back up with his two good friends, Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson). He finds that he is more popular than ever after his second encounter with Voldemort and happily returns to playing Quidditch. But as prophesied, fear takes control of Hogwarts as students start to become paralyzed, just as years before when the chamber of secrets was open for the first time. Harry is told about the chamber of secrets and how the true descendant of Salazar Slytherin is the only one who could open it. Harry fears that it is he, who has accidentally opened the chamber of secrets because he starts to hear voices coming from the walls and his rare gift of being able to talk to snakes. Harry, Ron, and Hermione journey to save others once again in this wonderful sequel and second chapter of the Harry Potter saga.Like the original, The Chamber of Secrets has a playful, family oriented tone to it. I found this to be a weakness because the books were not this way. ""Secrets"" finds itself quite equal to its predecessor in just about every way possible. The acting, writing, and effects, all kept at par with the first. Once again, ""Secrets"" comes up short with the book, but did quite well for an adaptation from a book.The thing I liked best about the movie is that the character of Harry Potter goes more in depth. He becomes more complicated than just your average kid who likes hanging out with his friends than with a family that he considers to make him miserable. He becomes much more than that. He shows us that he thinks in detail about other's actions as well as his own and finds himself making tough decisions throughout the movie. Whereas Harry changed immensely, the other characters remained quite the same, showing no complicity whatsoever. This was disappointing but understandable due to the limited amount of time given to cover a three-hundred page book. Overall, the movie was another great adaptation of the book and shows to be another nice step towards the breathtaking movies that should be soon to follow.I recommend this film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

One word - Fantastic!,"To those who don't enjoy a story, that's full of action, adventure and glory, then don't see this film, and spend your quids, unless you have a bunch of kids.This is not to say that Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a children's film, but merely that if it is not your style (fantasy, action, light entertainment), you will most probably not like it.I'm an eighteen year old woman (19 in 19 days surprisingly enough) and I enjoy the Harry Potter novels immensely. I'm an escapist, and the novels, and now the films provide me with an exciting and adventurous place to escape to.I was not disappointed with this film at all. I thought it not only lived up to it's predecessor (Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone) but surpassed it.There was more action in this film, but if possible, more character development. As Harry, Ron and Hermione go through the year we see them grow up.The direction and cinematography were wonderful. The landscapes, no matter how computer generated, were impressive. The action sequences were exciting, the special effects amazing. The acting was superb. All the actors were convincing, including the young main stars, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson and I hazard to say, Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy. Jason Issacs as Lucius Malfoy was absolutely brilliantly evil. The words ""nasty piece of work"" spring to mind.I did not think the film was over long, or too short. The beginning started amusingly. The ending perfectly rounded off the film.I suggest this film to anyone with a vivid imagination, whether a Harry Potter fan or not.

Riddle me this!,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was released into theatre's in 2002 just one year after the first movie introduced the world to what would later become a world wide phonomianom. The Harry Potter books are some of the best works of modern day fiction and in the past twenty years have become classics that will undoubtedly go down in history and be read by both children and adults for years to come.Chamber of Secrets is a very faithful adaptation of the original book and is a perfect follow up to the first movie Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone which were both directed by Christopher Columbus. The unique visual style and cinematography used by Columbus helped create a very unique and memorable world for the Harry Potter universe some things were changed in future installments of the franchise but many of qualitys that made the first two movies so memorable remained present in future installments.Chamber of Secrets was also the last Harry Potter movie to star Richard Harris as Professor Albus Dumbledore this was also Harris's final film role before his sad passing later that same year.I remember going to seeing Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets in the cinema on opening day when I was eleven years old with my family it became a tradition to see the Harry Potter movie's together those are some of the best memories I have with my family.This is a movie that can be enjoyed by both children and adults it's story is both engaging and interesting a perfect story for anyone who enjoys reading fantasy novels.,8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Big improvements,"Well, my previous review for SS was over-excitedly done. I wrote it about an hour after seeing the movie and I really should have allowed for some recovery time. In this instance, I watched CoS YESTERDAY (which was, for future reference, the following day of its theatrical release) as opposed to letting the hyper activity rush to my mind and just come home directly afterward scribbling something incoherent. SPOILERS AHEAD!I was amazed how fast they jumped into everything. It was like, BAM BOOM BANG--you're there. Chris Columbus really sped it up and for the better. It was good for ducking out of times that could quickly become awkward, with a some sharp humor and wit, J.K. Rowling's characters came to light. From the moment Harry is rescued in the Ford Anglia to the time when he and Ron decide to fly their way to Hogwarts, I noticed that many key elements are touched on but not explored the way they are in the book itself. Ordinarily this would be very bad for a movie of this scale but somehow it made it feel all the more adventurous and real to me. The special effects were well done. I was disappointed with Dobby though. I mean, it was SO obvious he was computer generated (he's ugly to boot). The Aragog scene had everyone in the theater cringing--I felt for Ron. I really did. And the basilisk eerily reminded me of that weird squid creature from 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. The detail oriented Potterheads should be warned. THE FOLLOWING WAS NOT IN THE MOVIE: Nick's deathday party, Percy & Penelope's little romance, some funny exchanges between Fred & George and de-gnoming the garden. (You will not believe HOW MUCH I was seriously looking forward to that last one!) Alright, so this might seem like a bit much. Don't worry. Even without these scenes the plot is left in tact, mandrakes and all! Speaking of herbology, I thought the casting of Prof. Sprout was right on target. Let me tell you another thing--KENNETH BRANAGH IS GILDEROY LOCKHART! I sorely wish he got more screen time. Probably one of the most hilarious scenes has him walking down a staircase pompously saying, ""Let me introduce your new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher--ME!"" At the same time there is an image of himself in a painting, striking debonair poses, and drawing self-portraits! His inflated ego was captured PERFECTLY and I was pleased to see that many of his lines were right from the novel! Daniel Radcliffe's acting has visibly improved. I felt that things were happening TO HIM not AROUND HIM. Emma was OK, although she is in my opinion nothing to crow about. Rupert does need to practice some differing facial expressions. Anyway, Chamber of Secrets was not only funnier, it was scarier. The petrified people look dead and Mrs. Norris' hanging is rather disgusting. Christian Coulson (who is handsome), Jason Isaacs and Tom Felton were delightfully evil villains. (I got a kick out of how they made Draco and Lucius look so alike, i.e. the blonde manes.) The plot is more involved, the actors more relaxed and everything is generally loads better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Best Yet,"I definitely am quite pleased with this title. This, along with the first, got the series off to a very good start--a start that was unfortunately stopped with the third film, but that's another story.The casting in this is still flawless. Lucius Malfoy was perfectly portrayed, with a smug voice and rigid stature. Richard Harris (God rest his soul) continued to amaze as Dumbledore, soft of voice and graceful of movement but with an underlying wisdom and power. Even Tom Riddle's actor pulled it off nicely.The soundtrack is also breathtaking. John Williams manages to capture the many tones of the Harry Potter universe without missing a beat. This work easily competes with his acclaimed Star Wars soundtrack.Overall this movie was perfect, and I give Chris Columbus two thumbs up; it's a pity he won't be directing any more of them. He set up the series nicely, and unfortunately, Cuaron ruined everything in the third movie, from the set to the actors to the flow. I keep this--and the Sorcerer's Stone--with pride, and almost wish I'd never bought the Prisoner of Azkaban.Good job, Chris Columbus, and everyone involved.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Good as the first,"The Good: Kenneth Branagh (stole every scene he was in), the plot.The Bad: Bad acting by the child actors (especially the actor playing Draco), overdone Hollywood effects (eg. spells that cause people to fly 20 ft through the air), turning the character of Ron Weasley into a useless wimp. The bottom line: Despite the flaws a very good movie 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Underrated,"In Harry Potter: The Chamber of Secrets, the writers and director again stick faithfully to the book, capturing almost every detail and in the process, make another brilliant movie. The criticism this movie receives has some truth though. At 2 and a half hours long, Chamber of Secrets is one of the longest Harry Potter movies, strange considering it is one of the shortest books. Some scenes could and should have been left out, and others did not have the greatest writing. Also, the soundtrack is for the most part a repeat of the first movie (although for me, that isn't a bad thing, later movies did not match the soundtracks of the first two.) Despite all the faults, Chamber of Secrets does a superb job of capturing the adventure and mystery of the books, perhaps better than any other Harry Potter movie does.While the length and many details could leave some slightly bored or confused, if you approach this movie with enough patience you will have a lot of fun.8/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Difficult to recommend to anyone other than Harry Potter fans,"This movie is difficult for me to rate. On one hand, it remains faithful to the book. On the other hand, despite being well-acted, with some good use of CGI, the Chamber of Secrets is often frustratingly dull and never really picks up until the final fight scene but then the movie slides back down into dullness again.Those who have read the book know how exactly the plot will turn out, but I will give a brief synopsis: Harry, after escaping the wrath of his twisted aunt and uncle and meeting a persecuted house elf who tries to stop him from going to Hogwarts, heads to Hogwarts anyway and finds that a 'horror' is lurking the school, targeting certain students, thereby arising talk about the Chamber of Secrets. Harry, Ron and Hermione (inevitably) must find out what's behind these 'attacks'.There you go. That, I reckon, is more entertaining to read than what actually happens in the movie. Most of the time, it plays out like a desperately dull episode of Law and Order, with the students finding out who the 'murderer' is through several clues and happenings elsewhere. It is like the whole book played out on screen, as such, each 'attack' is too thinly spread to create the interest that the film wants to coerce out of the audience.The acting, as ever, is pretty good. The actors who play Harry's aunt and uncle are suitably evil, while 'Dudley' is appropriately mean-spirited. Daniel Radcliffe, Hermione Granger, Rupert Grint and Tom Felton do well as Harry, Hermione, Ron and Malfoy, while Jason Issacs delivers a cold turn as Malfoy's father.The CGI, may I add, is quite good. The realism in Dobby and the Basilisk is almost eerie, as is the blood that pours out of the basilisk. No doubting that this is a well-made film.As I have said above, the only time when the movie gains impetus, however, is when Harry fights the Basilisk, however, that scene comes too late to reverse the dullness that precedes it. It's a shame really, as The Philosopher's Stone and The Prisoner of Azkaban are both pretty good movies.Maybe the fact that I dislike the book affects my outlook on this film. Now to the most pressing question: do I recommend the Chamber of Secrets? No, as I find it difficult to think of anyone who is not a Harry Potter fan getting real entertainment out of this film.See it only if you are a Harry Potter fan.2.5/5 stars",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
One of the Best Book/ Movie Series(My Second Review),"I know that I have already done a review of this film but I just can't say enough good things about it.  Usually sequels are not as good as the first movie but Chamber of Secrets went beyond the magic of the first film.  When the Harry Potter books first came out I didn't even know anything about them.  I finally started reading them last Thanksgiving and I was immediately hooked.  They are so great and J. K. Rowling has such a great imagination.  I think that my favorite scene from the movie was the one in the forest with Aragog and Lockhart was so funny but really cheesy also.  I think that Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint have all grown in their acting abilities and they were fantastic, especially when Emma Watson had to act very emotional after she had been called a mudblood by Draco Malfoy(Tom Felton).  I must say that the 2 hour and 41 minutes length scared me a bit, I thought for sure I would have to get up in the middle to use the restroom.  But it seemed to go by so fast.  I was just sitting there watching it and my mom says we only have 40 more minutes to watch and it was such a surprise to me because I thought for sure we had a longer time than that.  It was like going to see a movie that was 2 hours and 41 minutes long but it only seemed like it was a hour and a  half.  That's just my opinion though.  What really surprised me was the amount of adults that were there, I thought for sure that I would be the only 18 year old there but there were a lot of teenagers and a lot of older people also.  Now that I have seen Chamber of Secrets I am really anticipating the release of The Prisoner of Azkaban.  This is my favorite book from the series right now and even though Chris Columbus isn't going to be a director I still think that it will be a great movie.  I hope that the actors stay on for the films because I don't believe that it will be the same without Emma, Daniel, and Rupert.  Well I hope that you all loved the movie as much as me. On a scale of 1-10 I give this movie a 10.  Perfect, A++++++.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Warner Bros has done it,"The first movie was the setup, and this one is the payoff. ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" leaves all of the explanations of wizardry behind and plunges quickly into an adventure that's darker and scarier than anything in the first Harry Potter movie. It's also richer: The second in a planned series of seven Potter films is brimming with invention and new ideas, and its Hogwarts School seems to expand and deepen before our very eyes into a world large enough to conceal unguessable secrets. In the new movie, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe, a little taller and deeper-voiced) returns with his friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson, in the early stages of babehood). They sometimes seem to stand alone amid the alarming mysteries of Hogwarts, where even the teachers, even the august headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Richard Harris), even the learned professors Snape (Alan Rickman) and McGonagall (Maggie Smith), even the stalwart Hagrid the Giant (Robbie Coltrane) seem mystified and a little frightened by the school's dread secrets. The conceited new faculty member, deliciously cast, is Gilderoy Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh), author of the autobiography Magical Me, who thinks of himself as a consummate magician but whose spell to heal Harry's broken arm has unfortunate results. And then there is Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs), father of the supercilious Draco, who skulks about as if he should be hated just on general principles. These characters and plot elements draw together in late action sequences of genuine power, which may be too intense for younger viewers. There is a most alarming confrontation with spiders and a scary late duel with a dragon, and these are handled not as jolly family movie episodes, but with the excitement of a mainstream thriller. While I am usually in despair when a movie abandons its plot for a third act given over entirely to action, I have no problem with the way ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" ends, because it has been pointing toward this ending, hinting about it, preparing us for it, all the way through. What a glorious movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

True to spirit of original,"Harry Potter returns to the wizard school Hogwarts for his second year of schooling, along with his friends Ron and Hermione. But danger's afoot for the boy wizard. Before the start of his second year, Harry is visited by a House Elf named Dobby. Dobby warns Harry not to return to Hogwarts, but of course Harry doesn't heed his warning. Besides, he must escape from the clutches of his cruel, nasty adoptive family.So Harry's busted out from his imprisoned bedroom by Ron and his brothers in their flying car. It occurs to me here that this is a movie that might be just a little bit far out and trippy if viewed while under an influence not quite the same as reality. Ron's flying car takes the boys back to their family's house; unlike Harry's adoptive parents, Ron's parents are both magical practitioners; purebred magicians, if you will. It is with the Weasley family that Harry returns to the school.But alas and alack! Ron and Harry miss the train back to Hogwarts! Ah, the flying car; that'll do, that'll do. Naturally, they almost crash into the train with the car, and actually do crash into a particularly nasty gigantic tree on the grounds of Hogwarts. Eats cars, you know.That's just the beginning, though. The boys, joined by their friend Hermione, learn that people are being petrified for no discernable reason at Hogwarts. Who's to blame? Is it Snape, the professor with an obvious disdain for Harry? Is it Malfoy, the slicked-back blonde bully? Or is it the newest professor, Gilderoy Lockhart? The early evidence points to Harry, of course, and Hagrid, the Gamekeeper.Harry and his pals must follow the sometimes obscure clues to find out who's responsible for this skullduggery. What's worse, the headmaster, Professor Dumbeldore, is under pressure to find the culprit. And for some reason, there's this creepy whispering voice traveling through the halls of Hogwarts that only Harry can hear - and, for some reason, he can now talk to snakes? Does all of this tie in together, somehow?Well, of course it does. The appeal isn't the end result, it's the journey. This is about as good as the first Harry Potter movie, full of the same mystical charm, although the kids are growing up a bit (the boys in particular are hitting puberty, what with their deepening voices and all). I haven't read the books, but from what I'm told the movie follows the second book rather closely.A real treat for sure is seeing all of the veddy excellent veteran British actors in the cast: Kenneth Branagh,  Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, John Cleese, Robbie Coltrane, Julie Walters, Alan Rickman, Miriam Margolyes, and Richard Griffiths.The Chamber of Secrets is about what you'd expect from a Harry Potter movie; it has style, substance, verve, and audacity. The latter is because the movie dares to be as good as the original, if not better. All too often the sequel to a hit movie tries to rest on the laurels of the first film, not venturing out on its own. While it's evident that Chamber of Secrets is part of a series, it's also an excellent standalone movie.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is rated PG for ""scary moments""; in fact, there are some gross ones, as well. Which means your kids'll love it! The movie is 161 minutes long, so stock up on the popcorn.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A very literal translation of the book,"_Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets_ is a very enjoyable film to watch. Each scene moves along smoothly, making the near 3hr running time seem much shorter. Each actor falls solidly into the character they are playing, with Jason Isaacs solidly nailing the villainous Lucias Malfoy - every scene he has is fantastic.There have been some complaints about the CGI, but it works within the film. Certainly, not all the special effects are photo-realistic, but they are close enough and certainly don't ruin the audience's involvement in the film. The mixture of CGI and animatronics works very well and brings the concept of a ""magic school"" to life._Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets_' major failing is that it sticks too closely to the book. This has been a common complaint about the film because it causes what appears to be deus ex machina after deus ex machina to save Harry from the situation he is in. The book may have the room to explain why (for example) the Weasly's flying car suddenly appears out of nowhere to save our heroes, whereas the film ignores the reason. Character motivations are also not examined, an example being Harry having the opportunity several times to unburden his problems to one of his teachers, yet always choosing to go it alone. In ignoring the deeper aspects of the book the movie tends to only reflect the superficial which can be frustrating to the viewer.Despite this setback, this _Harry Potter_ film is very enjoyable. The ending climatic scenes may not be enjoyed by younger children due to its violence, but this is a small point. Whether it will stand up to the other great fantasy adaption of this period (_The Two Towers_), well, we'll just have to wait and see...",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Chamber Of Secrets,"I consider this film to be a serious step up from it's predecessor.There is a creativity at work here that you don't get in the Sorcerers Stone. There is a great tone of seriousness and levity. It is engaging, spooky, heart warming and feels real! A true adaptation of the book.The interesting thing is that this is the longest of all the movies, and the shortest of all the books. Why is that? I cant help but wonder if this movie could have been substantially shorter. There is a point where i find myself wondering how much longer is left! Which isn't a great question to be asking during a movie.The Chamber of Secrets film takes itself more seriously, and it pays off.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Still a sense of fun...,"Installment #2 in the Potter series still retains a sense of fun and adventure. There are still some non-digital special effects, which I like, and the production looks great.Gilderoy Lockhart does a good job, as does Alan Rickman as Snape, and Maggie Smith. A bit more ""involved"" than the first film, but not too dark for kids to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Need not be kept a secret,"I'm watching the movies of Harry Potter without read the books, unusual as it might sound to be in a position of never having read the Harry Potter books. I enjoyed the first one, and I think the second slightly has the edge over it for a number of reasons. ""Chamber of Secrets"" with the same director and almost the same cast, retains very much the same feel as ""Sorcerer's Stone,"" presenting a lengthy, expansive, and beautifully imagined world at the end of Harry Potter train (or in the case stolen hovercar) journey.This time, however, the basic characters and situations have been introduced, so more time can be spent developing the interesting characters that inhabit the school, and exploring its history. When an interesting world as detailed as this has been created it is natural that there should be room for curiosity about its history and lore, and this movie takes advantage of that. We meet parents, and learn history. In addition, the cast of child actors from the previous film have now grown somewhat and accordingly are given some slightly weightier scenes to handle, which they can do. This gives us a little more hint at character in our protagonists and allows a greater sense of attachment.In addition, while it is still there, any self-reverential tone to the original has been toned down a bit â as if once over the hump of making a satisfactory adaptation of a series of books with so many fans, the filmmakers feel they can let loose just a bit more. There's more humor, with very funny scenes especially early on in Harry Potter's uncle's house with Richard Griffiths. There's the addition too of Kenneth Branagh as a not-very-nice but still somehow likable and highly enjoyable character. Dobby is a delightful computer-generated character. Moaning Myrtle too is very funny.It's a complex operation to adapt such long books to the screen, I'm sure, and as such some of the niceties of the plot can get hard to pick out for non-readers, and some problems are solved by the magic-fantasy equivalent of technobabble, but that doesn't stop of from being fun adventure. It could be possible to say that the second Harry Potter film was just more of the same â but it's more of the same of something very fun, and a noticeably better version of more of the same.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
sorely disappointing,"I saw HP 1 first, and thought, ""Ok, pacing isn't that good, but it's beautifully shot and the music is very good, fitting, etc."" Then I went back and read the books and thought they were enthralling. HP is truly a work of art. Then I went back to HP 1 on video and thought, ""Ok I see where this comes from. It's really quite nice, now that I know what it refers to.""I approached COS the same way. There was a lot of ink written about how CC had accepted his limitations and was working within them comfortably on COS, so the movie seemed like a more comfortable, smoother film. I'm sad to say that, while the film is definitely more limited, it's not at all comfortable.The pacing was just horrible, with absolutely no dramatic tension. There was a superfluous car chase scene, which I guess was supposed to add action, while the ""action"" sequence with the whomping willow was ponderously slow. To top it off, Snape's scene was cut in favor of a sequence obviously culled from HP 1's cutting room floor. The enchanted bludger was quite fun. But then we go back to our stupor, until the final sequence with the slythering monster, which is even more unfrightening than dobby.  All in all, this was a severe disappointment.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Pleasantly surprised,"Watched the movie yesterday and was pleasantly surprised. HP-COS was much better and darker than the previous installment. The graphics and special effects were well done and the CGI character of Dobby was also interesting. I haven't read any of the Harry Potter books yet, so there was no bias or expectations before watching the movie. I can now understand its immense popularity. I find it surprising that even though the world developes technologically, at movies, we still seem to prefer our wizards and elf's and jedi's and the magical alternative universe that they dwell in. Three of last years biggest hits were based on fictional alter universes, and it looks like the same this year. And take note of the increased comic book heroes being presented and succeeding.

reviewing harry potter is always wonderful,"Since ""Harry Potter: the return"" came out, italian television has decided to revive this beautiful saga for fans. Yesterday the second episode was broadcast and even if I have already seen it millions of times, every time the basilisk scares me more and more ahahaha. Apart from that, this film in my opinion reflects the book very well, it is full of details and as usual the story is fascinating and even if the film lasts so long I never get tired of finishing watching it. I am also in love with the beautiful cast, of course, and every time I watch a movie I am more and more convinced that Daniel, Emma and Rupert are perfect for the lead role. Talking about this film, I think it is one of the scariest, so I do not recommend it to children.

Overlong but fun,"The second film in this film series has the same general strengths and weaknesses of the original.. The production design and effects are excellent and the cast is uniformaly good. However the storyline and film itself is overly padded and slow paced... a flaw of trying to adapt too much of the book. While this one is less padded than the original, lacking so much of the expositionary stuff, it could still have used some judicial cutting, losing a good half hour of the running time from this 2 hour and 45 minute film would have helped tighten things up enormously. Still, the film does have its entertaining moments and the young cast is getting better with each entry.It's also a hoot to see Kenneth Brannah hamming it up as one of the instructors.

The way the story is told is kind of similar first movie, but I consider that as a good thing as it was easy to follow and kept me intrigued.

not bad but book beats it by a million,I find as I wacth these movies they tend to leave more and more out from the books and that really annoys me. I know they could not afford to make the movie any longer then two and half hour but thats why I think books like this should not be made into movies.This movie is about young Harry Potter who goes back to hogwarts only to discover something called the chamber of secrets has been opened. He figures out that the reason its open is because the heir of slytherin is there. Once again the schools safety is up to harry potter.Not a bad movie but like I said the book is way better so people just stick the books I know thats hard for some of you for some reason.,6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Plot and focus are much tighter this time, omitting some of the subplots which are delightful in the book but discursive on film. Major flaw is the overly drawn-out ending.

More than adequate sequel,"""Chamber Of Secrets"" continues pretty much where ""Philosopher's Stone"" left off. Hence we don't get the long character introductions, and are thrown straight into the action. Although not perfectly true to the book in every respect (key lines are transposed from one character to another; key events are lost or misplaced), it's a pretty faithful representation.The first half an hour is perhaps the least interesting; it seems too fast-paced and action packed, and the story only ""starts"" properly the first morning when Harry is at the Weasleys' house. After this, however, the plot unfolds at a good speed and the magical touches which director Chris Columbus brought to the first episode are still there. Kenneth Brannagh is perhaps the brightest star of this movie, putting many of the other performances to shame with his witty rendition of Gilderoy Lockhart.Ron is funnier than before, Hermione is bossy as ever and the actors all seem to have grown up and into their roles well. We get a glimpse into the harsh relationship between Draco Malfoy and Lucius Malfoy, his father - a possible hint that Draco's bully attitude stems from his own father's evil. Perhaps the only major let-downs are the parts where the script strays from the book, and some of Daniel Radcliffe's acting appears a bit forced during the final 'Chamber' scene. However, this is what makes films such as ""Harry Potter"", ""Indiana Jones"", ""Back To The Future"" etc so watchable and memorable. People don't go to the cinema to watch real life, they go to escape it.Overall, a very good sequel in a series which looks to be turning darker and asks more fundamental questions with every film.

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets: 7/10,"In the sequel that surpasses the original, Daniel Radcliffe again plays our bespecaled hero, Harry Potter. He's now a second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, but his aunt and uncle (Richard Griffiths, Fiona Shaw), with whom he lives with, aren't exactly keen on his ""talents"". Dobby, a house-elf, comes into Harry's room and tells him not to go back to school, because bad things will befall him. Harry, of course, doesn't heed the warning.His aunt and uncle won't allow him to go back, but his faithful friend Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) comes to rescue him by a flying car! So Harry goes to school after all. But it looks like Dobby was right, because soon after sessions begin, students are becoming Petrified (why not?). To the common eye, it looks like Harry's arch-enemy Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton).This Potter out-magics the original one. It doesn't waste time on ""trivial"" aspects such as character developement. To someone who hasn't read the books or seen the first movie, it would be confusing with all the magical lingo and the characters who they do nothing to improve upon. Neville Longbottom gets into more fiascos, Draco becomes more meanicing, but that's about it. No word about Seamus Finnegan. We don't know that Dean Thomas exists, but they can't make a 161-minute much longer, can they?Radcliffe is OK as Harry, but I don't really understand people saying he's the next Haley Joel Osment. He's fine for these ""physically demanding"" roles but for a serious part? Nuh uh. Grint, as Ron, horribly overacts. We understand that he's Chuckie to Radcliffe's Tommy (a Rugrats analogy), but come on! Grint is just a little too excited to play a part in a movie. Hermione Granger, a know-it-all, is played well by Emma Watson-gotta see some of the school plays she's been in!Hogwarts has a new teacher for the Defense Against the Dark Arts class-Gilderoy Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh), Order of Merlin, Fourth Class, Five-Time Winner of Witch Weekly's Most-Charming Smile Award. He's egotistical, as I'm sure you couldn't guess. Branagh performs the best acting of the movie, except it would have been better if, like the book, he had had a larger role. He coulda been a contender.Richard Harris, as aged Headmaster Dumbledore, is pretty good; unfortunately, he sounds more sickly than the first. Maggie Smith, Professor McGonagall, was pretty good for her small role. All of the other teachers, such as cold Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) were acceptable, however small their parts.Most of my complaints are also complaints for the book, also, such as all the minor characters. However, if Chris Columbus had not tried to be so faithful to the book it would have helped. Obviously it couldn't be perfectly true to the book, but when Justin Flinch-Fletchy got Petrified, for instance, the movie watching audience had no idea who it was. In the book they at least get some more insight. Many of the speeches, such as Dumbledore's at the end, as almost word-for-word from the book (I had just re-read the book before). Not that it isn't inspiriational, but it's perfectly adapted.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is very good. However, the trouble with Harry (sorry...just had to!) is it's too faithful and some poor acting.My rating: 7/10Rated PG for scary moments, some creature violence and mild language.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Every Series of Stories must Have One One Puzzling Chapter,"""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" is the second movie in a series of movies about the life of a teen aged wizard. It follows the first movie ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"".The second movie in any trilogy is generally disliked. Why? Well, simply because it doesn't leverage the rags to riches, nerd to hero story lines that succeeded in the first volume of the trilogy.When George Lucas made ""the Empire Strikes Back"", he knew that the deal to make a third movie ""Return of the Jedi"" was already sealed. In ""the Empire Strikes Back"", Mr. Lucas had the luxury to put his characters to the test, knowing he needed no happy ending. He knew the happy ending would come in the third movie.Clever trilogy story tellers will establish a hero in the first volume, make the audience doubt the hero in the second volume, and reaffirm the hero in the third volume.Thus, the second volume is always the frankest exploration of a hero's development.This film supplies a necessary episode in a series of stories.

The magician seemed to have cast a stronger spell with this one,"HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS / Starring Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson / Directed by Chris Columbus and Written by Steve Kloves / Rated PG / ***Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was once a thing of beauty, in some ways playing like a resort beach house, a vacational spot which happened to be occupied by kidlets of the magical kind. However, that time has passed, and Hogwarts School is under an attack from it's own past. For when Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) receives warning of this dark force by an extremely worried house elf called Dobby, he is determined to save his magical school, not without, though, the help of his friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson).With Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, it's clear that director Chris Columbus is taking the safe way with the beginning chapters of the film franchise based on J.K Rowling's bestselling book series. Of all the 161 minutes I had witnessed of this second movie adaptation, I do not believe seeing any piece of the material dismissing what actually happened in the original source. Columbus is a rather uninspired director and this, like Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, is a cut-and-paste job. There was no bravery in making this film, but what I did see still entertains. Even though the movie barely differs from the book, it's magic lies in the ability to entertain young and old.The real pleasure in Chris Columbus' direction is that he seems to be a brilliant artist. He paints in the corners of the screen. There are very few scenes with at least a touch of computer animation or digital work. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is beautiful to look at. The images conjured in the head of a reader while reading Rowling's original novel is magnificently brought to life on screen. Watching these images unravel themselves on screen alone makes this movie worth recommending. The scenery surrounding the majestic Hogwarts is lush and utterly captivating. This is a movie about transporting you to a new world full of strange and illogical rules, much like Alice in Wonderland or even 2002s Spirited Away. In terms of the fantastic, it's vastly superior to that other big-budget franchise called Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones but never reaches the stunning images and affection found in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.But what about the story? With all these fantastic images, the story is king, right? The story here is, I think, a little bit better than the first installment. Chamber of Secrets is a more narrative arc than The Sorcerer's Stone. Anticipation leads to a stunning climax battle with a deadly snake, the only trouble is getting there. I think it can be argued that the plot in this movie unfolds much more slowly than it's predecessor. It is a mystery tale, plain and simple, with little touches of Quidditch and other magical activity. Much of the detail in this movie is focused on Daniel Radcliffe, and really, why shouldn't it be? Radcliffe plays Potter with more elegance and confidence. He is the enemy in his own story. As his classmates claim him to be the dreaded Heir of Slytherin, Harry is even more determined to clear his name. Radcliffe shows much, much promise with his acting here.This movie, like the last, includes an array of supporting characters. The two most notable are Ron and Hermione, Harry's closest friends. Even with only two movies in her filmography, Emma Watson is probably the most talented young actress in the film world today. I hope many other producers notice her role in these two films and snatch her up for their own. Grint, on the other hand, has trouble with the script. Screenwriter Steven Kloves has Grint doing nothing but standing around, looking scared. What's more of a tragedy is that Watson is absent from all of the film's third act. The adult actors get a bit more screen time than they did last time, however. Still, the greats like Alan Rickman, John Cleese and Robbie Coltrane are reduced almost to mere cameos. The saving grace of this cast is Richard Harris in his last screen role as headmaster Albus Dumbledore. Unlike his sleepwalking role in the first film, he brings grace and presence in his role. I just wish he had a lot more to do.With Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets as a sequel, there are much new dazzling sights to see and new things to hear about. There are many nifty digital effects in nearly every scene, giving us more insight to the world of wizardry. Though aside from the technical magic, Kenneth Branagh as the flamboyant Gilderoy Lockhart is the greatest addition to the film. Much like the Wizard of Oz, Lockhart is only a cover-up, style over substance as he fails to generate any magical power throughout the movie, covering up as he goes along. There is also Professor Sprout of the greenhouses and Madam Pomfrey of the hospital wing.Even with all the ga-ga sets and spectacular special effects, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, I think, betters the original ""Potter"". This story goes a little deeper, the acting stronger and the art direction gorgeous. However, it still feels hollow in the core, that this maybe isn't the real Harry Potter we should be seeing. It isn't strong enough to stand as it's own movie franchise. Many who have not read the books I think will find very little in the film to enjoy. The entertainment is mostly in the visuals. It does remain a solid piece of enchantment for the 161 minutes, but that's all it is. The books created this vast world, complete with fully fleshed-out characters and interesting subplots. The movies follow the main story, not daring to turn the camera off the story and into the deeper interactions between Rowling's vivid characters. But then again, at 161 minutes, maybe we're lucky not to experience the full Potter.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Doesn't live up to the original's mark,"After watching Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone I had gotten really high hopes for the Harry Potter franchise. I was expecting all of them to be as simplistic and visually appealing as that movie. With that in mind I watched the second movie today and sadly, it doesn't live up to the mark on almost any of the parameters. That's not to say that it's a bad movie. It's not. But it's not a good Harry Potter movie.To begin with, the movie's CGI hasn't aged pretty well. And that's actually really surprising because the first one was so good so this one should have had a higher budget and thus more advanced VFX. But other than the Basilisk, most of the CGI hasn't aged so well. Especially that of Dobby. When he was banging his head in the drawer in the beginning of the movie, the shelves of the drawer were shaking in the opposite direction of where they should shake. And when Harry puts Dobby in the wardrobe it looked more like the wind is opening the door instead of Dobby. There are plenty of examples of bad CGI in the movie but I don't want to take it too far.Speaking of Dobby, he's had a very bad introduction. The way he is behaving is annoying. If I were to behave like that my mom would have slapped me all across the face. Sure he does get a wholesome ending, but that's yet to see how he turns out. Draco also became more annoying now, with constantly trying to bully Harry even though he can't do a thing. Myrtle spoke like a nerd Harley Quinn. I get this movie is trying to be campy, but that goes way too far.The story is a good part here. Although it's not as easy as Sorcerer's Stone, it is still very nicely detailed. Too many incidents happen in it, but yet it does not feel bloated. It feels absolutely to the point, with none of that ""side quest"" things movies often use to pad the runtime. Everything happens for a reason and it all pays off in the end. The scenes with Ron, particularly in the beginning, are always funny and memorable. Though Hermione doesn't play as huge part in this movie as Harry and Ron do, she also gets a decent screen time, although without any character arc.I'm still on the second movie of this franchise, so I can't exactly say if this is among the good movies or the bad ones. But I really hope the rest of the movies are more leaning towards the first one in terms of tone. I remember every scene right now, but I can see myself forgetting most of the parts in the next few months.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Childhood memories,"""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" is a fantastic follow-up to the first film in the series. The movie picks up where the first one left off, with Harry returning to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for his second year. This time around, Harry and his friends must face a new threat in the form of the mysterious Chamber of Secrets, which has been opened by a dark force within the school.The film does a great job of building on the characters and world established in the first film, delving deeper into the mythology and history of Hogwarts. The young cast all give strong performances, with Daniel Radcliffe once again shining in the role of Harry. The addition of Kenneth Branagh as the pompous professor Gilderoy Lockhart is also a standout, bringing plenty of humor and charm to the film.The visual effects in ""Chamber of Secrets"" are also impressive, particularly the scenes featuring the basilisk, a giant serpent that terrorizes the school. The film's darker tone and themes of fear and prejudice add a layer of depth to the story, making it more engaging and emotionally resonant.Overall, ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" is a strong sequel that successfully expands the Harry Potter universe and sets the stage for the rest of the series.

Sometimes I still have the feeling that there's a whole lot of exposition going on, setting things up for something to come later, but this feeling extends all the way through the end of the movie, which, by the way, I don't remember it being anything like that in the book. Speaking of which, if these movies weren't so slowly paced, maybe they could get more of the books into them!Anyway, the movie is alright, but it isn't great, and in retrospect, I'm beginning to feel the same about the books.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Second of the series,"""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" is the second film of the popular series about the boy wizard. I didn't find this one to be as good as the first film (""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone""), but it's still a pretty decent movie.This time out, Harry and friends begin their second year at Hogwarts, this time in a darker tone, as they encounter an evil presence that threatens the existence of the school. Just about everyone from the first movie is back, with a couple of new faces added to the mix. Kenneth Branagh and Miriam Margolyes are introduced as new professors, and Jason Issacs portrays the father of Draco Malfoy, Harry Potter's main nemesis. Everybody's terrific once again.The elements here are just as good as they were in the first movie. Except I have one quibble about it: the 161 minute running time of the film. The first movie ran only ten minutes shorter than this one, but it felt faster. This second movie felt a little slow going at times, and I kind of wished that director Chris Columbus wouldn't have put so much of it into the finished project. I know Columbus was trying to be faithful to the book, but is it really necessary for a family movie like this to go on for as long as it does? It didn't have to. Nevertheless, this is still for the most part a fun film, and Harry Potter fans will like it anyway.**** (out of five)",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
almost is not good enough,"Dobby the house elf warns Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) not to return to Hogwarts for his second year of magical lessons soon after the audience receives a taste of Harry's miserable existence with the Dursley family in the opening sequence of director Chris Columbus' Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.  Dobby, a computer generated character and one of the special effects that keeps this film moderately entertaining from start to finish, remains ambiguous in his warning but stresses that `terrible things are about to happen!'  Many audience members exit the theater wondering if Dobby spoke of the dangers awaiting Harry at Hogwarts or the trite and threadbare story awaiting theatergoers for nearly three hours of the film's duration.Screeching mandrakes, the howler Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) receives from his mother (Bonnie Wright), a conversational diary, the phoenix, the ghostly Moaning Myrtle (Shirley Henderson), and other special effects including a cinematically superior game of Quidditch make the second Harry Potter film better than the first installment and superficially enjoyable, but spectacle alone cannot sustain a film even in this magical world.  Kenneth Branagh wins the hearts of his female students and audience members in the role of Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, Jason Isaacs is notably cold and cruel as Lucius Malfoy, and the late Richard Harris as Headmaster Albus Dumbledore creates depth for his character amidst the other one-dimensional characters of the film, but these three veterans along with Maggie Smith as Professor Minerva McGonagall cannot tap their wands and make magic out of Steve Kloves' lackluster script that includes the most exciting events from J.K. Rowling's novel but fails to support these events with other necessary plot points making much of the film random and nonsensical.The young actors including Radcliffe, Grint, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger, and Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy generally showcase improved performances from their first attempts in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, but they all lack the versatility and subtlety of accomplished actors.  None of these amateurish actors attempt to find believable persons within their characters, and consequently each character emerges as a dull caricature.  Harry is the unsuspecting hero.  Ron is the pathetically helpless and bewildered sidekick.  Hermione is the brain of the operation. Draco is the representation of evil.  The script provides only one-dimensional characters, and none of these actors has the ability to create something out of nothing as more skilled performers can do, which adds to the banality of the film.Columbus' first priority for the next film in this series should be to find a screenwriter with a vivid imagination and the creative ability to bring Rowling's world to life.  The cast will miss Harris as Dumbledore and the young actors need a few more lessons in their craft before shooting begins, but with a decent blueprint this cast has the potential to rival anything the imagination could possibly create.  Improvement is a step in the right direction and the film is almost worthy of some acclaim, but as Ron discovered in Professor McGonagall's class, almost is far from perfect and never quite good enough.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Chamber of Secrets is an improvement over Sorcerer's Stone,"HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS is the second film in the HARRY POTTER film series.The story follows Harry Potter's second year at Hogwarts as the Heir of Salazar Slytherin opens the Chamber of Secrets, unleashing an evil monster that petrifies the school's pupils.How many sequels can be considered better than the original film? There are many, are they? And guess what? HARRY POTTER and the CHAMBER OF SECRETS has made it on to that list.The story follows the book nicely, but with a few things taken out of the movie for reasons. The film is directed by Chris Columbus, which this film would be his second and final time directing a Harry Potter film as he would produce ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"", released in 2004.The music by John Williams is amazingly well-done and he is a great composer. He was also composing CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, MINORITY REPORT and STAR WARS EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES at the time, so he used themes from the first film.The visual effects and production values are flawless. The acting is once again amazing. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Bonnie Wright and Rupert Grint and Tom Felton all return from the previous film. The rest of the cast returns as well and this would be Richard Harris' final film appearance as he died after the film's release.The action is amazing. The dialogue is amazing and spectacular and Steve Kloves did a great job writing this into a suitable film.Overall, HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS is good and better than SORCERER'S STONE and more. This film is just amazingly well-done and Warner Bros. managed to create a sequel to the first Harry Potter and that is one hell of an accomplishment for 2002.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Perfect example of how not to use CGI,"Whats all the fuss about these harry potter films, i cant remember being so bored whilst watching a movie the story is weak at best and the acting is a joke.And worst of all is the use of CGI, I don't mind the use of CGI in films as long as its used in the right way i.e it actually looks real and you forget about the fact thats its created by computers whereas in this film it just looks so fake especially the serpent at the end of the film.Overall a really poor movie for fans of the book only i.e kids under the age of 12.2/10",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Too Corny for Even a 22 year old kid,"Harry PotterÂ..what can I say about this movie? Well let's start by pointing out that the movie had better graphics than the first movie.  The acting was questionable for some of the kids (including Harry Potter) but not for the adults.  I guess is because I'm from New York, I just don't buy the perfect image that HP is presenting; I guess that's why people call it fiction.  The kid is too proper, to innocent to be raise with such bad parents, I just don't buy it, it seems like a lie. I have to admit that I read the book, and I found the book so much better than the movie but not in the sense that most people are criticizing it. The movie portraits the book as perfect as it could, I just think that HP was meant to be read instead of being see.  Imagination is always different for most personal and by looking at the movie you are just exposing the point of view of a few people.  This is what I consider a true children's movie, I don't think I should be making a big deal out of how HP's acting or lack off, since children don't care about that, but they did over act a little bit.  I just found the film a little too corny for even a 22 year old kid.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Where the story really begins,"This is where the Harry Potter story really begins to take off.  This movie is a little more horrific than the first story with some frightening visuals.  Think giant spiders and snakes.  The story is tight, and well told, limiting us to the world and knowledge of Harry Potter, the way it should be.  Music and sound are great.  Cinematography is beautiful and smooth.  The acting is better that what I would expect from a film centralized around a large amount of teens and pre teens.  If you saw the first, see the second.

Not a family film. Don't bring the adults.,"A trite, and painfully stretched-out, melange of hackneyed fantasy nonsense.The special effects are the usual high quality ILM fare - alas they're the same old ILM fare. Nothing seemed particularly novel or groundbreaking. (Though the morphing was fairly well done, certainly no joins visible, and the animated tree had an excellent organic feel to it.) Alas the film seemed to exist pretty much for no other reason than to tie a sequence of otherwise unconnected visual special-effects 'jokes' together.Acting was fairly unexceptional - the actors themselves were generally of a peerless standard, in their particular genre. However, it seems they were all told to just play their traditional genre. I could see the fast show residues in places, die hard ones elsewhere, and was genuinely expecting to see spilt cups of tea and perhaps reference to antiques elsewhere.John Williams needs to stop creating scores using copy-paste from his older ones too.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Better than the first one.,"I finally decided, after 24 years since the first movie came out and builded a worldwide fanbase, to watch all the Harry Potter movies. Just to see if it was worth all that fuss. I'm 56 now, so not really part of the audience they aimed at, but in all fairness I enjoyed watching the first Harry Potter. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson were so young, what resulted in some childish acting, but now one year later they already matured a lot and became better. This J. K. Rowling story is slightly lesser rated than the first one but I thought it was better. The green screen scenes could still have been better though.

I am TOTALLY green with envy at Kenneth Branagh!,"Prof Lockhart is the sort of character I would in my wildest dreams have loved to play. As the conceited, flamboyant, secretly craven rogue who's a little too outspoken to be likable, he's the sort of character I would die to perform.With that aside, I think this film should be congratulated for keeping the personality and characterization that made the first one such a popular success. Yes, the series is getting darker and sinister, and (IMHO) is losing the distinctiveness from the rival LOTR that made the first one so memorable; but the characters are still great fun to watch, have a wonderful chemistry, and the whole effect still clicks very well.Rupert Grint is still displaying a great knack for comic delivery, Daniel Radcliffe still has the balance of mischievousness and seriousness that makes him such an excellent lead. And Emma Watson is definitely maturing in the role like a full-grown expert.I thought the final climax was a bit too rushed, and forced; it was very difficult to follow all the plot complications (as I'm not familiar with the novel - which the filmmakers shouldn't assume). But this was still great entertainment value. And I think Hugh Mitchell's Colin Creevey is very cute and sweet.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Unforgivable disappointment,"Many films fail to measure up to the books on which they are based.

Short of remaking the first two episodes while the kids are young enough to pass as 11 year-olds, there is only one hope. Teach Daniel Radcliffe to act (which should be possible) and find a director who has taste, style and appreciation for the elegant magic of Joanne Rowling (which is definitely possible).

"The Harry Potter series returns with a powerful sequel that adds to the depth of the story introduced in the original film and even throws in a few new characters, all of whom fit perfectly into the Harry Po","The second installment in what is proposed to be the seven-part Harry Potter series delivers the same intensely imaginative and visually stunning wonders of the original, and is widely considered to be much darker, literally and figuratively, than the original. It is refreshing to see that this sequel did not take the treacherous path of trying to cash in on the success of the original (an unfortunate tendency that is occasionally successful, as in the case of Ace Ventura and Blade, but almost always results in a bitterly disappointing sequel, as was the case with sequels to Austin Powers, Men In Black, Halloween, Mission Impossible, The Exorcist, etc.), and the film is wisely just as faithful to the novel as the first film.I have heard and read many complaints suggesting that director Chris Columbus was not creative enough to add in his own vision to the film, changing it enough here and there to make it his, but this is completely unnecessary. Books are only adapted to film if they are at least moderately successful in their literary versions, and the more successful the book is, the less reason there should be to change anything in it. The Harry Potter novels from J.K. Rowling have been justifiably described as `publishing phenomenons,' in which case I can't see any reason why anything should be changed in the film version. The books have developed a tremendous fan base, and what these people want to see in a film version of the books is a cinematic experience that is as imaginative and fantastic as the one that runs through their heads as they read the novel.I read both of the first two Harry Potter novels after having seen the films, and both times was amazed at how faithful the films are to the source material, a little detail which has led to tremendously satisfying adaptation films in the past, such as The Green Mile, The Shawshank Redemption, Stand By Me, and Great Expectations, which was a great film despite the fact that it falters slightly in the last act. The Chamber of Secrets is an adaptation film that follows closely on the heels of a tremendously successful predecessor, and still manages to hold its own.The younger audience is sure to delight to no end in the way that our three heroes, Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger, take on the task of solving the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets (I'm surprised that this was never used by Franklin Dixon (whose real name escapes me at the moment) as one of the titles of one of his thousands and thousands of Hardy Boys novels), entirely on their own. This is an adventure tale of the highest order, which pits these three pre-adolescent wizardry students against an ancient mystery that the rest of their schoolmates and even the most seasoned staff at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry are rather apprehensive about looking into.As the Harry Potter series continues, it becomes more and more apparent that J.K. Rowling had the entire series in mind when she began writing, as much of the action and the story in The Chamber of Secrets involves and expands on material from the first film. The lovable Hagrid, for example, was mysteriously expelled from Hogwarts fifty years earlier, for reasons that he never liked to discuss, and through a story told by probably the most innovative diary in fantasy/adventure movie history, Potter is taken back in time to see exactly why he was expelled, which reveals Hagrid as the prime suspect in the film's mystery and helps to keep the audience guessing until the very end.Aside from bringing back all of the original characters, the movie also sets up the third installment by giving us a detached but fairly clear introduction to the wizard prison Azkaban, in that we hear a lot about it and see Hagrid taken off to spend some time there, which only wets our appetites to see it more clearly, which is sure to happen in the third film. One of the more interesting extensions on the original story is the introduction of Draco Malfoy's equally antagonistic father, played with precision by Jason Isaacs, who adds perfectly to the rivalry between Draco and Ron (whose families famously have remarkably opposite financial situations) by pitting Ron's father almost head to head against Draco's father. The good vs. evil plots in the Harry Potter films have so far been just about as ultimately shallow as the ones in the Star Wars films, but as was also the case with those, The Harry Potters are so imaginative and come across as such stunning visual experiences that it makes up for the basic storytelling technique.Even more than in the first film, Harry and his friends are faced with solving a tremendous mystery without any outside help, which usually comes from the lovable Hagrid, who has unfortunately been wrongfully accused and thrown into prison, leaving them entirely on their own even among a variety of helpful professors, particularly Albus Dumbledore, who also runs into some serious hardships that it's up to our heroes to fix. The plot revolves around a mysterious creature that seems to have escaped from the Chamber of Secrets (which does or does not exist, depending on who you ask and what they're too afraid to admit) which is running around the school occasionally petrifying students, crimes for which Harry Potter himself is gradually blamed.The rivalry between Potter and the vicious Draco Malfoy is just as fresh and appealing as ever, with Malfoy never seeming to let go of his hatred for Potter, a hatred which he holds for good reason and which expands upon his character's personal history, as well as Potter's. The mystery escalates to a point where the entire school is on lockdown, and the very future of Hogwarts is considered doomed, even by the head masters, McGonagall and Dumbledore. Harry Potter and his friends embark on a wonderful and tense adventure in this powerful adventure film. My only complaint about the Harry Potter films so far is that the endings tend to be a little bit too clean and tidy, almost to the point of being Scooby-Doo type endings, but the adventure is so genuine and so exciting that it more than makes up for polished endings. The Harry Potter saga is off to a powerful start, and the success of the novels certainly suggests that this will continue.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

After it was over my reaction was ""So?""Director Chris Columbus and screenplay scribe Steven Kloves should have spent more time on emotion and less on thrills, put more effort into character development and less into effects.Yes, I know this is a movie for kids and I don't expect deep philosophy, but J.K.

"With a darker mood, we have several passages of humor (usually caused by Rony), thriller, horror and drama are also present and works perfectly at the end","After Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone to collect $ 974 million worldwide, the second highest grossing in history at the time even though it was released almost simultaneously with The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, the production sequence was soon to begin. All the success of the first film left fans and executives eager for the following chapters. The potential of the stories of the orphaned wizard was huge success and the Philosopher's Stone was only ratified sure the executives at Warner. A year later, hit the screens the adventures of Harry Potter in his second year at Hogwarts School of Wizardry, director Chris Columbus bringing the original cast back and incremented other big names known to the general public.The screenplay by Steve Kloves once again does not disappoint and leaves nothing of what is contained in the pages of JK Rowling out. Many of the phrases of the books are again in the mouth of his interpreters in cinema. Kloves repeated once more the formula is also the same as books. First we have an opening sequence at the Dursleys (even better than the first one), then we have in the presentation of new Hogwarts teachers after the mystery of the film begins to manifest itself in the midst of learning new spells and Quidditch games . Until the last act, the mysteries will be solved until Harry is confronted again with his greatest enemy, that each chapter tries to come back to life somehow different. Though many scenes are very similar to the previous film, many other events are presented in the world of magic and new scenarios before unexplored comes up.The director Chris Columbus, screenwriter Steve Kloves and producer David Heyman remained with the support of JK Rowling in the development of the sequence, but they knew the story of The Chamber of Secrets had its peculiarities. We still have much of the discovery of the magical world by Harry and his friends, and a tone still remains child, as well as the general structure of the plot, but the tone of the film would be another, darker and with more mysteriouys.The cast child again does well and are noticeably safer, delivering best performances for their characters. Harry Potter Daniel Radcliffe replaced by more initiative now that he considers Hogwarts as his home (as stated in the last sentence of the first film) and will do anything to protect her from danger. He is able to break the rules to bring peace to the school and to protect his friends. Rupert Grint also feels even more comfortable to release once and for all the comic side of Ron through his remarks and facial expressions. Emma Watson is also better and more dominating character. In this movie, Hermione is more friendly with Harry and Ron, and someone becomes easier to handle. She is less obsessed with the books and is quieter. But remains loyal to his friends. Even without such effective participation in the climax to be petrified, Hermione still greatly helps friends to leave a trail qu would be followed by friends towards the Chamber of Secrets.The main adult cast all returns. Richard Harris as Dumbledore, Maggie Smith as Minerva McGonagall. Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid (also again playing an important role), John Cleese as Nearly Headless Nick, Alan Rickman as the mysterious Professor Snape. Richard Griffiths as Uncle Vernon, Fiona Shaw as Aunt Petunia, David Bradley as Mr. Filch, John Cleese as Nearly Headless Nick, Warwick Davis as Professor Flitwick levitation. Other characters who were participating in the first short film has more scenes, as Mrs. Weasley Julie Walters, and Ginny Weasley played by the lovely Bonnie Wright, the youngest of the family, who is studying his first year at Hogwarts. Gina would even have an important role in the climax. First appear Mark Williams as the father of the Weasley family, Arthur, who works at the Ministry of Magic, and the new Teacher Against the Dark Arts, Gilderoy Lockhart, played by Kenneth Branagh, Miriam Margolyes, who plays Professor of Botany , Sprout, and Jason Isaacs in the role of malevolent Lucius Malfoy, father of Draco. In smaller roles can also see Shirley Henderson as Moaning Myrtle ghostly and Gemma Jones as Madam Pomfrey, the nurse who will heal the petrified with mandrakes.Budgeted at about $ 100 million and production started a few weeks before the release of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, in November 2001, and termination to their filming six months before its premiere, the film had a short time to all post-production step. For the cinematographer, John Seale does not return and who occupies his place is Roger Pratt, who had been tasked by Columbus and David Heyman to give a darker tone to the film. Pratt, for those unaware, is the director of photography for Batman (1989) director Tim Burton and Frankenstein (1994) directed by Kenneth Branagh (who in this film plays Professor Lockhart). For this, Pratt and Columbus sought a new lighting in this film, most melancholy. The impression that something could happen at any time is very well traveled. It's clear as many night scenes and / or dark all the time. The darkest scenes and tense corridors of Hogwarts, the room of Professor Lockhart in Harry helps you answer the letters to fans when he is in detention, the scenes of the girls' bathroom, the scene that Harry is teleported inside the book Tom Riddle, and especially the scene Aragog and the other hundreds of spiders in the Forbidden Forest and the final sequence in Chamber of Secrets.John Williams returns to the soundtrack and makes it a great job, but not inspired. It basically keeps the music theme and mood of the first adventure, bringing some new compositions for the moments of tension and suspense.
The fantastic creatures are more diversified in Chamber of Secrets and mobilized a huge visual effects team, under the responsibility of effects supervisors Jim Mitchell and Nick Davis, and the talented artists at Industrial Light and Magic.Chris Columbus was put to the test by the producers since had to supervise the post-production of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone and simultaneously began an arduous period of pre-production Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. In this second film, Columbus can go directly to the narrative and adventure, and managed to engage the viewer right from the beginning, from the moment that the protagonists come to school, making the mystery surrounding the petrification of the characters at Hogwarts was developed intelligently and cohesively. The few subplots positively influence the central story. Just like in the books, The Chamber of Secrets is one of the most important of the series. Several facts we see here is a direct link to The Half-Blood Prince, the fifth book and film, exploring the past school superficially Tom Riddle / Lord Voldemort. Again, even with the more somber mood, we have several passages of humor (usually caused by Rony), thriller, horror and drama. A noticeable trend for the film series in all aspects and that served to win new fans for once one of the most successful franchises in the world.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A thrilling return to Hogwarts,"""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"" directed by Chris Columbus, is the second film in the Harry Potter series and successfully builds on the foundation laid by its predecessor. The film takes a darker turn as Harry returns to Hogwarts for his second year, only to find the school plagued by a series of mysterious attacks.The story revolves around the legend of the Chamber of Secrets, a hidden chamber created by one of Hogwarts' founders, Salazar Slytherin. As the danger escalates, Harry, Ron, and Hermione must unravel the mystery behind the attacks and the chamber itself.The film benefits from the returning cast, with Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson continuing to bring their characters to life with growing confidence.

The sequences involving the enchanted flying car, the Whomping Willow, and the climactic confrontation in the chamber are particularly well-executed.""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" successfully deepens the lore and expands the magical world, making it a thrilling and engaging continuation of the series. Its blend of mystery, adventure, and darker themes make it a worthy sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"The second Entry of this wizarding world, is far from spectacular","Now I am going to be doing a Harry Potter marathon, whilst the Televison Siries is coming out next year...I thought it would be a good idea to Rank these movies. I am not the biggest fan of the books, the movies. But I do have fun with them. And Harry Potter:And the Chamber of Secrets is for me the worst in the siries.The acting is mostly fine, but the defense against the dark arts teacher is way over-the-top in my opinion, and theirs alot of over acting in this movie, and specifically with him. He has charm, he has charisma, and he thinks he has bravery. And he thinks he's a best selling book artist, when in reality he is just annoying.Another thing I am not typically fond of is the spiders plot-line. It just doesn't make a whole lot of sense, surely Hagrid who knows the spiders, surely he wouldn't just let to teens in the woods to follow the Spiders? And they also appear and disappeare throughout the story, so I am not sure sure what their inclusion is really for, probably to layer the story. But anyway, Harry and Ron find the spiders. And Harry tells the spiders, ""Did Hagrid open the chamber of secrets"", and he's like No. And then decides to eat them. And then their gone again and out of the picture.And the stuff with Lord Voldemort, ""I am Lord Voldermort"" felt rather silly and a bit cringeworthy. But I love Tom Riddles storyline here, very well developed. And looking back on Hogwarts to find out who used the Chamber is really interesting and who could of been with Moaning Murtle that night really gives this movie high stakes and is interesting because you don't quite know what's going to happen.The actual storyline to this movie isn't bad either, infact it's really interesting, and it's a great contrast from the first film which was mostly world building, yeah it had stakes. But not as high as this one. And on the topic of inclusions, Dobby was a breath of fresh air. Being the slaves of the Malfoy family. Warning Harry about a Serious plot, and not to go to Hogwarts. Whilst his uncle is down stairs talking to a few workers. And hears to much commotion upstairs, so decides to put handle bars on Harry's window. God he lucked out.Then Ron and his brothers come to Harry's aid, and use the flying car. Which when they go to Hogwarts, leads to a good scene where they almost hit the train, pure memes that is. So they get to Hogwarts, and very late. It's almost as if someone didn't want Harry to be at Hogwarts, I just love the build-up to this story. It's very well crafted. Professor Snape isn't best pleased with them, and completely boils to the point of frustration and anger and rages at the boys due to there stupidity and lack of self awareness. They are however, allowed to stay at Hogwarts, due to a few conditions.The end fight scene is so good, and is probably the best in the Potter franchise. So full of energy and so much pase throughout it's exciting and engaging to watch. The Snake like Creatures smell and it's pace is frightening, as well as it's hight, as the tension is raised up high. And the power it has. Adds to the high stakes of the film, which this film mastered.Theirs alot more I would love to cover, however their is sadly a limit on here, but I do enjoy this film, just a couple of set backs for me that ends up being an average affair, but not bad. Just the others in this franchise are slightly better or even much better in my opinion.So, would I recommend this film?Yes, Just switch of your brain from Time to time and watch the movie pose it's magic to us, 5.5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"""Harry Potter"" is the ""Star Wars"" of the new generation","I just came back from seeing ""Chamber of Secrets"" and I thought it was excellent.  Most of the flaws from ""Sorceror's Stone"" have been fixed, particularly in the special effects dept.  The story is brilliant and it stays true to the book, yet works wonderfully on screen.  I believe that Harry Potter is THE fantasy series of the Millenial generation (kids under 20), the same way the Star Wars trilogy was for Gen X-ers.  That's not to say adults won't enjoy the film, because as a young 20-something, I am both a huge ""Star Wars"" and Harry Potter fan.The ""Chamber of Secrets"" is a much darker story that requires the viewer to pay attention to every detail.  Older kids and adults will most likely enjoy this film.  Reading the books isn't a requirement, so don't let that stop you from seeing the film if you aren't already a fan.  Since I read the book 3 years ago and forgot many details, I think I enjoyed the film more. Purists may be disappointed at certain omissions, but casual fans and newcomers with open minds should be very entertained.I'd definitely recommend seeing the first movie before this one, especially if you're new to the series.  Otherwise, you might have lots of ""what the heck?"" moments.  This film delves deeper into the wizard world, with even stranger creatures and sinister plots involving elite wizards.  The first film was basically an introduction to the wizard world, following a very straight path through one school year.  The second is more story-oriented, jumping from event to event without a real sense of time.  We do get to see Christmas again, as a sort of benchmark.  This movie flows so well, that you won't believe you've been sitting in a seat for almost 3 hours; the time really flies.I won't go into story details, since you can read those anywhere, but I'll just make a few comments.  ""Chamber of Secrets"" is very Harry-centric, meaning the Harry, Ron and Hermione team of the first film is rather weak. Both kids take a backseat to Harry in this one.  It was comforting to see the old sub-characters again, especially the Gryffindor kids, but none of them contribute much.  Of the new characters, I thought Tom Riddle was the most fascinating.  Gilderoy Lockhart was a hit amongst both adults and kids in the audience.  I felt Ginny Weasley and Colin Creevey were the most neglected of the new cast, but that doesn't affect the film itself. Moaning Myrtle is annoying, but well played.  Dobby the elf was adorable, not looks-wise, but I couldn't help falling for the poor, little thing.As for scary content, there are a couple ""jump out of your seat"" moments and a few tense moments that are amplified with very loud sound effects.  Like the first film (flying keys scene), the noise level is irritating at times, as I saw a few people put their hands over their ears.  The spider sequence isn't so bad, but younger kids might want to shield their eyes.  The battle with the chamber's monster at the end is probably the scariest scene for kids, it's reminiscent of any ""Jurassic Park"" confrontation.  There were dozens of kids as young as 3 in the theater, and none of them seemed to have a problem.  From an adult's POV, I thought the baby mandrake scene was the most disturbing, if only a bit.A few more tiny things I'd like to mention:  The music is excellent, an overall better soundtrack than the first one.  The special effects were much improved, the only real hokey-looking one involved the flying car over the countryside.  The sets are gorgeous, I just loved seeing the Weasley house and the Chamber.  The best part of Harry Potter is that it's an enchanting, intelligent experience for people of all ages to enjoy.  I'd give the film a pretty solid 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
LOVED!,"I didnt feel after watching the first movie that I had to go back, but this one I am itching to see again.  I do not even know what it is exactly, it was just so entertaining and interesting and different.  The 2hours and 40 minutes flew by, when usually I can not take going to long long movies. Also, it was defnitely an adult oriented, whereas I did not even understand a lot of things that happened.  This makes a movie great in the sense that kids can enjoy it even when they dont understand all that is happening, and adults can apprecaite it for this complexity that surrounds the story and its characters. I was very impressd with the screeplay as a result, and highly recommend the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The transition of Hogwarts - and voice transition of Daniel Radcliffe,"In 2001, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001), directed by Chris Columbus, introduced millions of children to the world of magic. In 2002, he delivered The Chamber of Secrets - a more dark venture into the world of magic.As a disclaimer, I am not a direct fan of the fantasy genre, and have not read J.K Rowling's revered books. However, as a films, I enjoy the universe.Daniel Radcliffe still plays wonderfully, but his boyish charms withered early, as his voice transitioned sardonically with Rupert Grint's. Of course, this is a physiologically natural phenomenon, but I think it attenuates the premise of the universe; that Harry is growing up.Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are still wonderful in portraying their characters to near-perfection as the quirky and over-achiever, respectively.A note on Professor Dumbledore, Richard Harris to me is the definitive character embodiment - and better than Michael Gambon who also did a great job. But Harris was far more emphatic, and far less alpha male in his expression in my opinion., Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith are still wonderful. The immersive production design from the first one only grew stronger in this, and Chris Columbus once again nails the direction.Recommended!",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
not as good!!,"my husband and i took the kids out of school to catch an early show of harry potter and the chamber of secrets.  the kids loved it but we were both a little disappointed in it.  i can't imagine how they would put more in it as it is already almost 3 hours long.  it just didn't flow as well as the first movie did.  they followed the story as well as they did for the first one but it just didn't grab me like the first one did.  the books are so detailed that it is hard to get all that in one movie, but some how i felt that to much was left out. i will take the kids to see it again if they want but i will not be as eager as i was for the first movie!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Off we go to Hogwarts!,"MY RATING- 6.3The mov has just premiered here in Portugal, but I'm not of those maniacs who went in the first day. I simply waited quietly a week til the hyped calmed down.I heard the cast and Chris Columbus saying this one was better than the first, bla bla but when I went to see it I thought `Are you kidding me?' `D ya think this is better than the first one?' I felt it was similar to what happened with `Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom', like trying to be a lot better than the first one. More special effects, more action scenes, and the story was left behind!Well we still have great acting by the kids (I believe they have a high IQ!) and from the rest of the cast including Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Richard Harris (God rest his soul), Robbie Coltrane, and also Kenneth Branagh, who is a great add as the narcisist Lockhart.Yet what is missed? Maybe the magic that the first one had, the sense of discovery of new places. Yeah, I know we have here the chamber of secrets, yet the whole mov is almost like an idiotic cat and mouse thing after the right enemy, much a la Scooby Doo. The question is- does it entertain? Is it interesting? My answer is YES, of course any kid will be pleased, and the fans will be even more happy. Now does it work in cinema? My sincere answer is NOPE. Maybe they were trying to make it similar to the book, but 2  hours and half sitting on theatre is a privilege only some flicks can have. Harry Potter is not that interesting! Maybe movs like `Ben Hur'!--Finally I'd like to say `Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' had some success here in Portugal, we also have a lot of J.K Rowling's readers. I'm not one of them, yet I have to confess this is a good entertainment for kids. It's simply not my style",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Absolutely dreadful 'Back to School',"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was special because of the Magic. Seeing Hogsworth for the first time, Harry getting out from the despair that was his Muggle life, the young wizard saving the school from Lord Voldemort.The Chamber of Secrets contains no secrets and the magic is dead.  You simply revisit Harry and his crew - you see Hogsworth for the second time, Harry is rescued from the despair that is his Muggle life and a tad older wizard saves the school from Lord Voldemort.  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is coming soon - I felt like I was sentenced early with 'Chamber'.This film is a painful 2.4 hours long.  Its the exact same film - the 3 are in trouble over and over again.  The 3 know things that they refuse to share with the school's staff.  The school's staff blames these 3 heralded students for continuous misdeeds and continuously clears them of the misdeeds as they again prove to be heros.  A scene from the book's opening is nowhere to be found - making the end wrapup somewhat hokey as well.You know about 40 minutes in that this movie is the exact same film that you saw last year with a different title.  I spent the next 2 hours fidgeting and checking my watch.  I wouldn't recommend adding this to your DVD collection when it is available.  I, for one, would rather head back to my own school in September than watch this movie ever again.

Real improvement on the first movie,"Well, I was quite pleasantly surprised with Harry Potter II. Like LOTR, I thought the first movie got off to a visually terrific start, but then got progressively bogged down for one reason or another.To an extent 'Chamber of Secrets' suffers from the same problem, but in this case the first half hour isn't just visually terrific, it's absolutely amazing. The fantasy vision just completely enshrouds you. After that it does suffer a bit from the same problem as its parent: i.e. once they get to the school, you find that without amazing, panoramic things to look at, the story tends to grind on a little (it's a 155 minute movie, after all). However this fault was less bothersome than the first time around, and there is hardly a scene which doesn't contain something unexpectedly delightful (or horrible).That's one thing that impressed me about Potter II: whereas George Lucas would just fill his second trilogy of Star Wars movies with a plethora of fantastic, whizzing objects, and hope that their cumulative effect would be to daze you into not noticing how boring the film actually is - Columbus deploys all his little cameo monsters, gadgets, objects and scenery with some loving care. The result is that you don't just get gratuitous weird things; you get pleasing weird things which look like they belong where they're filmed, rather than shoved in your face to amaze you.Though it's quite a while since I saw the original, it seemed to me there was a more adult tone to this film. Certainly there was at least one fairly substantial sequence which was skin-crawling enough to provoke a response in the average adult.The casting is just superb - again, Columbus employs people who not only can act, but are perfectly suited to their roles, whereas Lucas relegates his few good actors to bit parts and fills his lead roles with people who would barely cut it on 'The Young and the Restless'.A really impressive film that gets a solid 8.0 from me (the original got 6.0)",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Feels like a horrormovie at points and its great,"Maye its just me but when I watched this movie as a kid, I felt scared sometimes watching this movie. Its a radical change in the tone the first one had, this one feels more like a mistery movie, where there is a killer and the protagonists need to find him out. I have never felt this from other Harry Potter movie and thats why this one sticks out with me. Despite a lot of people saying that this is the worst one, which may be true, it still is a very good movie, a very decent adaptation and a brilliant sequel that presents us with more concepts from this magic world.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A decent second film in the Harry Potter franchise,The Chamber of Secrets is a decent film and a stronger film than its predecessor. From the start we are captured by the mystery and intrigue surrounding the Chamber and the story behind it. We are also treated to an amusing start with Harry and Ron trying to make their way to Hogwarts. Part of the charm of Harry Potter and making him relatable is his down to earth character and nature.Dobby proves to be a mystical and interesting addition as does moaning myrtle. The chamber of secrets storyline really delivers and we see a lot more about Lord Voldemort and the animosity he has with Harry Potter.

This movie is slightly darker than the first, but that's to be expected when there are disembodied voices and one gigantic snake.

I also can't tell you which parts are better in the book or if they left too much out.Having said that (guilty as charged for not having read any Potter book), I have to admit, that I did like the second part better than the first one. But that does happen sometimes, especially with movies, where much explanatory work has to be made (I'm talking about the first Potter of course, I think Chambers ... no wait, I can't remember the title, doesn't really matter though).

The 2nd movie in the series is a good follow up in introducing us to the world of magic,"The first movie is magical in the sense that introduces us to the world of magic - it gives us a glimpse of how a world of wizards might look and establishes the basics of magic. The second movie here extends our understanding of what magic can achieve - traveling with floo powder, making cars fly (even making them sentient), and temporarily transforming into others are just some examples portrayed in this movie. Even though we know a lot about magic at this point, there's still a lot left to unpack in order to understand the capabilities of this world.What surprises me the most is that this movie, being close to 3 hours long, somehow still feels rushed. It moves on so fast that it's remarkable. The story is right there but I believe that without reading the book I'd have a hard time following what is going on. On one hand, the (potential) confusion is good for the average viewer, as the world of magic sometimes does require a lot of explanation and in this way we can put some effort into our own interpretations by learning about magic our own way. On the other hand, I feel like reading the book is kind of like a requirement to understand the plot or the filler that connects some of the dots. Some of the key characters (Ginnie Weasley, for example) in this movie barely had any screen time even though their input into the story is colossal. For the mystery plot of the movie, trying to guess who's the culprit, the lack of screen time for the suspects ends up in us guessing just from what the protagonists determine based on insufficient evidence.Overall, this movie is still really good besides having the unusual trait of being both long and rushed. It has some of the most memorable and iconic scenes - mainly the ones that include the spiders, which may be the only scene I remember from the movie when I watched it for the first time 15 years ago - and this is also the final movie with Richard Harris portraying Dumbledore as Harris died a few months before the premiere of this movie. Our relationship with the world of magic grows deeper with this movie and it still feels like we're only in the introductory level. Can't wait to see (and simultaneously read) what's next.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
My most painful movie experience EVER!!!!,"I went into the cinema having not seen the first Potter film but after about 5 minutes, I realised that it made absolutely no difference because even a brain-dead neanderthal would find it easy to understand.The film, in my view took a while to get started and the introduction was far toooooooo loooong. Then it got to the middle part of the film, which is usually the juicy bit. It turned out to be just as bland and pointless as the first part. After about and hour i started getting very restless and soon after that i started dozing off.The film was in a word... well there are no words which aren't x-rated to describe the film.Please please please do not go to see this film, it'll only encourage them to keep on making more and more and more.Marks out of 10? well I'll give it 0.5/10 as a sympathy vote for being so pathetic.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Very Good Movie,"I have just watched the second Harry Potter movie again and I thought I should review it this time. First off, I would like to say that this was one of my favorites of the series, because it is not all happy sunshine and roses, and yet not super dark and sometimes frightening Deathly Hallows type of a movie. I like that. I will start with the acting. Fantastic by all, and great in special effects scenes. The best acting job for a woman was by Maggie Smith, or Minerva McGonagall, in my opinion. She had a straight face and never broke character at all in the entire movie. The best acting job for a man was by Richard Harris, or Albus Dumbledore, also in my opinion. All of the other acting was still good. To the dialogue. It was also great. Not cheesy, but still good enough to have a little bit of humor here and there around the film. Now the characters. J.K Rowling was very creative writing this book. She actually came up with the names for the characters from constellations and mythology, like Draco Malfoy, from the Draco constellation, and Remus and his brother Romulus Lupin, first names coming from two children in Greek mythology who were raised by wolves, and Lupin means wolf in Latin, I think, but I'm not sure. And of course, the special effects. They were awesome! A break from the completely CG world of movies today. It had some CG, but only when it was necessary. When it was not, they had extremely realistic huge figures, that at times, looked like they were real. Good job special effects guys! Lastly, the only reason I give this a 70% is because it is a little bit too long (I would have given it an 8).Overall, I give this movie a 70% because it has awesome special effects, good dialogue, and great acting, but it is a little too long.

An improvement over the first part,"After the somewhat underwhelming ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" I wasn't in a hurry to watch this second Harry Potter movie, but I finally got around to it and I'd have to say that it's a definite improvement over the first one, although there's still a lot that could be done better.The best thing about this movie is that it's a lot darker and more mature than the first one. Most of the childish humor is gone, the characters are far more convincing this time around (the children have obviously grown in their roles), and the tone of this movie is definitely more serious than that of the first one.The plot yet again sticks very closely to the book, although it's a shame that in spite of a 2+ hour running time, almost all things that were not essential to the main plot have been left out or marginalized (e.g. Lockheart barely plays a role of importance, and none of the sharp humor from the book makes it into the movie).I also think that too much time is spent on the action sequences (e.g. car ride, quidditch match) and the climax. They look a lot better than in the first movie, but they're all stretched way too long and take up time that could have been better used to flesh out the world of Harry Potter a bit more.With a bit more focus on characters and details instead of endless action sequences, this movie could have been great. As it is, it's certainly watchable, but it still feels like the director took the easy way out.**1/2 out of ****",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

AWESOME!!!!!,"This movie was totally amazing!!!! I actually read the book 5 times, so I knew what was going to happen, but I still loved it! It was really scary at times, even for me (I'm a horror movie fanatic). I was sitting in the 2nd row from the front (every other spot was taken) with my friend, and I'm telling you, it's really creepy the way things just jump out at you when you're that close to the screen!! But anyhoo, it was better than the first....it was scarier, funnier, and more action packed!! If you haven't seen it yet, I recommend you go TODAY!!

"Certainly, not as good as the first one","I was very dissapointed by this movie. Good special effects aren't everything movies are about. It was a product made for a lot of people but not for Harry Potter fans. Movies are generally not as good as the books they were adapted from, but Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was fun. This sequel wasn't. The only highlights I can point out are performances by Alan Rickman, Kenneth Brannagh and (surprisingly!) Tom Felton. Eye candy for the little ones but anyone over 18 who has read the book, shouldn't go in expecting to be blown away.

Return to Never Never Land.,"Daniel Radcliffe is back and this time he is slightly older but still the same Potter. Only this time, there is a flying car and a diary involved. Does this sound great to you? Maybe it does, but for me I needed something more.Radcliffe and his buddy Gint use the family car to fly around and leave fending for itself on the Hogwarts campus. This is much like ""Ernest Goes To Camp"", when the golf cart drives itself around and shows up almost when you least expect it. However, the car is not as funny.For me the Diary of Tom Riddle is OK. Near the end of the film when you find out who Tom Riddle is, and its not Peter Pan, it makes alright sense. Combined with the fight with the serpent near the end and you have an OK movie.Like the first one its slow in some parts, somewhat entertaining in others. Overall, its slightly above fair.

As most sequels...not as good as the first,"This may have been for the 12 and under crowd but I still love fantasy, and feel this is the reason there are too many things going on at the same time. To keep me coming back though I need more answers to the ongoing STORY. For instance why does Harry keep going back to the Mogules (S?) where he obviously not wanted. I felt with the job he did and the credit he began with in the first movie he should have his own room/office/laboratory. The first movie also lacked full information on why everyone knew him as if he was reincarnated, these could have been added here too instead of the constant mention of his scar. All in all I stil enjoyed the movie but as a young at heart adult would like more of to the storyline. I mean much effort is put into movies now so they will be watched over and over again this suggestion may help.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Read the book instead!,"This is probably my least favourite of the HP series. Gilderoy Lockhart frustrates me so much and even Dobby is a bit too childish for my tastes, despite knowing of his later heroic actions.The three leads are still not giving the best acting performance and it's quite obvious next to the superb acting of the supporting cast. Lucius Malfoy's casting was perfect, but for me, Kenneth Branagh's part should have been played by someone younger and more handsome, based on my imaginings from the book.What also disappoints me about this film, is how much was cut from the book. I longed to see Harry's longer stay with the Weasley's and de-gnoming the garden in particular.Generally not a big fan of spiders either, so that's a hide behind the pillow moment for me. I agree with Ron, that it should be ""Follow the butterflies"".An integral part of the story as a whole, but if I didn't have OCD I might start at film 3 and skip the first two as they are definitely aimed at a younger audience.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Just give up, Daniel and co!","It is never gonna work! Daniel Radcliffe has to go. My first review (philosophers stone) still applies to this one.

However it is marked at a low 2 as the main part goes to Daniel who trashes the whole film. He should smarten his act up and learn how to act. He has slightly improved since the last one and that is why the mark goes from one to two.To improve with marks- If Daniel was replaced with another actor then about 5-6 points would come in, I have no prejudice against the actor yet feel he gives weakening performances.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Great Fantasy,This continuing fantasy is the zenith of children's entertainment.  It continues to thrill audiences in a pleasant manner.  No doubt Alan Rickman continues to shine in his role.

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"Chris Columbus returns to direct The Chamber of Secrets, and he does a very nice job of taking everything he's learned from the first installment, and improved on them. Columbus seemed more comfortable this time around, being more free with his style and shot selection, crafting another well told story. He kept the continuity from the first, while incorporating a slightly darker tone, that works extremely well with what Columbus was going for. Columbus capitalizes on fleshing out this brilliant world, while giving the characters more layers, but he kept things pretty safe, incorporating a little bit more exposition. I give Columbus credit for making this more of a story-based film, with nice conflicts and mystery, but he had a tough time pacing all the events out. He allowed for a great deal of filler, and subplots, that makes the film feel inconsistent, and unfocused.Daniel Radcliffe returns as Harry Potter, and he was given some great layers, to go along with his charming character. He was given so many great character moments, making his character even more investable! Steve Kloves did a really good job writting his character again, fleshing out more of his back story. Emma Watson returns as Hermione Granger; while she has some good character moments in the first act, she seemed to get sidelined in the last two acts, sadly being used as a plot device. Steve Kloves did his best to make the best out of her character, but for this only to be the second film in the saga, I don't think it was the best idea to use her as a plot device. Rupert Grint returns as Ron Weasley, and he also wasn't given that much to do, rather than being the comedic relief. Even though our three leads had some nice character moments together, working on their great chemistry, I just would've liked more of them together! Tom Felton returns as Draco Malfoy, and this man just wants to be Harry Potter so bad! Felton puts on a good performance, that bounces really well off of Radcliffe, even though his character isn't written the greatest. Albus Dumbledore, played by Richard Harris, steals every scene that he's in! He was given more to do this time around, having some nice character development, on his noble, and wise character. Alan Rickman as Severus Snape, is another character that absolutely steals every scene that he's in. Coming off of the first installment, Snape was a tremendously intense, and mysterious character, and he continues that here. He was also given more layers, but he too, was somewhat sidelined. Robbie Coltrane favorably returns as Rubeus Hagrid, but he really didn't have much to do at all. He was soley used as a plot device. Kenneth Branagh makes his introduction into the Harry Potter saga, as the new defense against the dark arts teacher. Even though he fits the scheme well, while putting on a decent performance, his character is still pretty forgettable, and can be annoying, at times.The screenplay by Steve Kloves again, was another well written script! He does a great job of adapting this mythical sort of speech, while interweaving this brilliantly timed humor. Kloves does a really good job of creating so many memorable lines, that the dialogue never gets boring!Chris Columbus really took a step forward when it comes to the magic and effects. Columbus incorporated a surplus of magic sequences, just being an absolute blast of fun! The CGI and green screen work looked a lot better this time around, surprisingly, because it only came out two years after the first installment.Overall, I feel like The Chamber of Secrets is just a tad better than The Sorcerer's Stone, just because of the fun characters, better story, more action, and just an overall better looking film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Better Than The Original,"This was better than Sorcerer's/Philosopher's stone by far. Gone are the painful introductions of the first film, and now we just have the definately improved acting skills of the kids from one film to the next. Rupert, Daniel, and Emma are all great talents, and the Warners and Columbus are lucky to have them.I do have several complaints...I don't think that Dobby looked good enough for the size of the budget that they had. Also, the creature at the end (I won't say what it is, in case you've never read the books or have yet to see the film) was a little disappointing, but scary enough to give the impression of impending doom. The giant spider (Aragog?, cant remember!) in the Forbidden Forest was awesome, though.Not enough Robbie Coltrane! He was what really made the first movie, and despite the fact that he's not a major character in this film, his on screen time is welcomed and wonderful. The late Richard Harris delivers a wonderful performance as professor Albus Dumbledore, and his character will be missed in the remainder of the series.~ J",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Potter is back- but now with more thrills and seriousness than the first,"""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" is the sequel to ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone."" This time is his second year at Hogwarts, and something odd has been happening.I don't remember the story exactly, except that Harry is constantly warned by Dobby that something bad is going to happen. Harry finds Dobby to be a nuisance but something is definitely going on. Weird things happen after that.""Chamber of Secrets"" is the most thrilling Harry Potter so far.(There's only been one before this.) I found it to be on the same level as ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" even if it's inferior to ""Goblet of Fire."" I don't think this has as much story as ""Azkaban,"" but it has enough action and thrills to match ""Goblet of Fire."" It also works as a decent horror film, even if it won't scare too many, it's entertaining. The sense of mystery is there, as always.With each new ""Harry Potter,"" I suspect that the series will become darker and more mysterious.

quite worth the wait,"I was very anxious to see the second movie, so naturally I was also afraid of being disappointed. I absolutely love the books and just the whole world of Harry Potter and I'd hate for it to have anything that I don't like. CoS the movie, however, didn't let me down. I admit I am slightly sad that the development of the story needed so much time that there was almost none left for secondary things ilke classes, quidditch matches, things like that. However, I think Chrish Columbus and the crew did a great job adapting the book into a movie and certainly it couldn't have been expected to be word for word.The main plus of this movie, in my opinion, are the new ""secondary"" actors. Namely, Kenneth Brannagh and Jason Isaacs, Shirley Henderson and Julie Walters. They did a fantastic job bringing their respective characters to life! I also had quite a few laughs induced by Rupert Grint's great acting. Not a waste of time, not a waste of money and very much worth to wait.

Could Have Been Better,"Let me warn everyone of this first:  I am a Harry Potter, so my expectations were high.  Also note that this is my least favorite Harry Potter story.All right, now that that's out of the way, let's begin.  First of all, a warning to parents: there are some grotesque scenes in the film.  At one point, Ron vomits slugs (for a bit too long, in my opinion) and in another scene a ""snake's"" eyes are pecked out and bloody sockets are left.Last year's film, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's/Sorceror's Stone, followed the book rather closely.  This one rearranged scenes, completely omitted two major scenes (The Deathday Party, Lucius Malfoy selling illegal wizard goods in Knockturn Alley).  If this made the action more effective, I would have been all for it.  But the editing did not help the story at all. In fact, it hindered it.Another criticism:  Hollywoodization.  Scenes were overdone and pushed far beyond their needed limits.  The first film had some of this, especially in this Quidditch scene, but this one went too far.   Be warned.However, there were great moments of humor.  Though I didn't approve of Dobby's design, he was used effectively.  Kenneth Branaugh was brilliant as Gilderoy Lockhart.  But the stand-out of the class was Draco's father, Lucius Malfoy.  You could see the evil in his eyes.  His portrayal was nothing short of astounding.Additionally, the cinematography was excellent.  The CGI was a big overplayed, especially when the Chamber of Secrets was opened.  And was it just me, or did the Basilisk look like Godzilla?I think ..Prisoner of Azkaban will be interesting in the arms of a less Hollywood-ized director.Rating:  8.5 / 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Potter entertains!,"As with the first film, Chamber of Secrets has all of the visual flair that the first possessed, and--thankfully--the same key cast members to reprise their roles in this fine follow-up to Philosopher's Stone.What I think is most pleasing about this film is its controlled use of special effects. Some might say it goes overboard, but for a film about wizards, it is surprisingly restrained, concentrating more on atmosphere than visual theatrics. Sure, the eye-catching effects play an important role in this movie, but so does the plot, with some fine touches in character and friendship development.Unlike other longish films in this genre, Chamber never tires. An entertaining treat for all ages.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Here's my opinion.,"I'm sorry if this gets lengthy.I read quite a few of these reviews before I went to see it opening night in the states, Friday the 15th. This is my first comment since I've joined IMDB, and I figured I'd make my first comment one for the Harry Potter movie.I personally am a huge fan of the books. I think they're brilliantly written and are great books for children and adults. Although there are quite a few people who would disagree with me and say that they are bad for children and so on, I feel that it is better to have children reading than being on computers, playing video games and watching t.v. The books, in my opinion are all about imagination and letting yourself get lost in a magical world. Having an imagination is one of the best gifts one can have.I'll start with the Harry Potter movie by mentioning the first one. I read all of the books before the first one, so of course I was really excited. When I saw the first one, I was very pleased to see all of the things I had read about be put into a Hollywood film.  To my surprise, a lot of the things matched what I was seeing as I was reading the book, and that made the movie even better. I think the cast is amazing and unbelievable considering their age.  Also, the children are fans, so it was cool to see them put into their acting what they thought their characters should be like.  I'm sure we'll see a lot out of them in the future.Obviously, as I've said above, I loved the first movie.  Now I will state what I thought about the second movie. As soon as I walked out of the theater for the first movie, I said to my one friend that I couldn't wait for the second movie. I made my friend a fan of Harry Potter due to dragging her to the movie and lending her my books.  Due to me looking forward to the 5th book and the second movie to come out, at times that's all I could think about because there were some things that I was eager to see and read.As I walked into the theater for the second movie, I was really energetic and hyper because it was finally time to see this movie.  I was so happy as the movie went on.  Of course I noticed a few of the things that were different from the book, but when making a movie from a book, you HAVE to expect that.  I loved the movie. It was awesome to me. The basilisk was one of the things that I was most anticipating.    Continuing on, when I walked out of the theater, I almost thought that it was a movie that someone might not enjoy as much if they didn't read the book.  There were some things in there that I could imagine someone being confused about, but that still doesn't mean the movie was bad.So all in all, I loved the movie, and i think everyone should go see it. Can't wait for the third movie!!! Concluding this, I would like to say R.I.P. Richard Harris.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
I recant...it was worth the seven bucks,"Unlike my earlier comments, the second installment of Harry Potter is surprisingly decent.  Consider each reason that I type here is worth a dollar. (1) The adapted screenplay of Steven Kloves.  The adaptation stayed faithful to JK Rowling's novel. (2) The rather skin-crawling performance of Jason Isaacs.  I think this was his best role since ""The Patriot"" and the best supporting role in the film. (3) The film had excellent plotting.  I was in awe at several unexpected twists the film took. (4) England's A-List reappeared again.  Kenneth Branagh did really well as the self-centered Gilderoy Lockhart. (5) The art direction is still some of the best out there. (6) Daniel Radcliffe will be forever remembered as Harry Potter. (7) The special effects are noteworthy again.The downsides are...(1) the length, (2) the marketing to those younger than myself, (3) the book will always have the upper hand.Seven reasons make this movie worth the seven dollars.

The Strongest Of The Harry Potter Films Thus Far,"""Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets"" is a phenomenally well-made film. Although it has taken me a while to start appreciating the Harry Potter films, I can safely say that this one is the strongest of the four so far, with great action, visual effects, acting, story, and tone.The film begins with Harry Potter receiving a visit from a strange house-elf named Dobby, who warns Harry not to go back to school next year, for there is a terrible danger awaiting him there. When Harry gets to Hogwarts School For Witchcraft and Wizardry (after some perilous yet humorous encounters), strange things start to happen. There's a crying ghost named Moaning Myrtle in the girls' bathroom, the new Defense Against The Dark Arts teacher is an egotistic madman, and a mysterious part of the school known only as the ""Chamber of Secrets"" has been opened. Soon, no one in the school is safe, and the danger comes to the point where Hogwarts could even be closed. But not if Harry can do anything....The film is well-acted as well as swiftly-paced, despite the fact that the movie is quite lengthy. Lots of characters and actors from the previous film return for this installment. Overall, this film is very good and is certainly not one to be missed, wizard or not.Rating-***1/2",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
More magic from the paranormal prep school,"Java Man Reviews ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" (Rated PG) Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com December, 2002.OVERVIEWIn this, the second of a planned series of seven films, a strange creature named Dobby visits Harry Potter (Radcliffe) while Harry is at home on summer vacation with the dastardly Dursleys. The ""house elf"" warns Harry that a deadly new menace--one that turns students to stone--is wreaking havoc on his beloved Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry. With his friends Ron and Hermione (Grint and Watson), Harry returns to Hogwarts and begins to search for the Chamber of Secrets, where he hopes to locate and destroy the source of the evil. According to legend, a strange serpent stands guard at the chamber door, but Harry must also contend with a diary that writes itself, evildoers from Hogwarts' past and suspicious characters who turn up in all corners of the paranormal prep school.REVIEW: 3 of 4 Java MugsNear the beginning of the movie, we are flying over an extraordinary complex of buildings that seem to be made up of well-carved, picturesque miniatures. As the camera moves closer, however, we actually enter a full-sized room and have magically arrived at Hogwarts School, thanks to one of the many compelling visual devices employed by the filmmakers.The faculty and staff at Hogwarts remain deliciously eccentric, played by British film legends such as Oscar winner Maggie Smith and the late Richard Harris. But the ones to watch are the three cohorts in conjuring who lead us through the halls of Hogwarts to places we never thought could exist. New to the cast is Dobby, a computer generated house elf, and Branagh, a hapless teacher of the dark arts. Dobby is far less annoying that Stars Wars' infamous Jar-Jar Binks; Branagh, unfortunately, is not.Topnotch production design and cinematography combine with slick editing and well-orchestrated action scenes to provide a fast-paced, sumptuous visual feast.Can the cast and crew keep it up for seven films?

Still good but the weakest in the series,"After going back and rewatching the entire franchise...Chamber of Secrets has remained my least favorite of the 8. Too be fair: it's still decent. Like all the films in this franchise, even in its weaknesses it still has a charm, plus it and lays a lot of solid groundwork for the following films (where most would agree the franchise really picks up). However Chamber of Secrets was at a point in the series where it was stuck in the middle of a tone, not quite committing as a movie for little kids...but also not committing as a movie for adults. Again, they strike that balance MUCH better in the films preceding.Furthermore, Chamber of Secrets, more than any of Harry Potter movies, played out like a book. In a negative way. Just a lot of tangential filler scenes that could have been cut (of course if you DID cut them then a lot of hard core fans of the book would have been upset, so it's a lose lose).All in all, the sets are still great, John Williams music is still magical, and it's always fun stepping foot into JK Rowling's Wizarding World of Harry Potter. 6.9/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

"Not a great film, still pretty good","This movie is 2 and a half hours long and feels like less than an hour, this is both good and bad as I can happily watch this film over and over again but it also means its quite forgettable and fails to really make an impact. That being said this is a great sequel and many of the things that made Philosopher's Stone good is carried onto this one. Where this movie falls short in my opinion, is the plot. Chris Columbus has been called a tactless director and I can see where some of his scenes, particularly the action ones, are played so broadly that they lose all semblance of meaning. He is not particularly adept at handling the young actors, who come across as pretty bland and uninteresting. Rupert Grint as Ron is sort of annoying, overplaying the stuff that was likeable at first. Likewise, he is unable to invigorate some of the scenes, especially action scenes like the car scenes, the spider scene, and even the final encounter between Harry and the Basilisk and they come off as overlong and particularly flat. The main problem with the film is that it has been produced in a very dull, bland manner. Instead of focusing on Harry's uncomfortable realisation that the wizarding world has problems and his shock at how quickly the school turn against him, Chris Columbus seems intent on making the film a magical version of a school where kids merrily skip around solving problems, like in Scooby Doo.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"More Action, More Humor, MORE FUN!!","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was way better than the first. Although some people may have not been amused the first time and said that they wouldn't bother going to see the next, well, THEY SHOULD. The action for this film was good followed by the humorous jokes (mostly by Rupert Grint, a.k.a. Ron) but it was very entertaining. This movie not only proved to be entertaining but also proved that Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, and Daniel Radcliffe are great actors. This movie got a 7 1/2 out of ten from me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"If you enjoy the book, you'll enjoy the film; otherwise don't bother","Not a fan of the Harry Potter franchise, I really did not want to see this film.  My boyfriend on the other hand was itching to see it.  Being the generous hearted person that I am, I bought two tickets for him as a present and accompanied him to the cinema.My feeling is that if you enjoy the books, you'll enjoy the films which are basically an on-screen illustration of the book.  The success of the film depends on the viewer having seen the original or at least be familiar with the story so far from reading the ÂPhilosopher's Stone'.ÂThe Chamber of Secrets' has its moments with some memorable scenes (Ron Weasley vomiting slugs; the flying car scene and another Quidditch chase). The special effects are also good; Dobby the house elf is an impressive creation whose computer-generated animation integrates convincingly with the live action.  Julie Walters as Ron Weasley's mother and Kenneth Branagh as Gilderoy Lockhart  are perfectly cast and provide a lot of the fun in the film.  To me, where the film is lacking is in the child leads ÂI just cannot bring myself to care about what happens to them.So, having watched two of the Harry Potter films, I'm afraid to say that I'm still not a converted fan of the series.  I fail to see the charm of the stories that seems to captivate readers and viewers in the thousands and actually find the whole Harry Potter concept boring.  This feeling is accentuated by the fact that the film is over two hours long which in my opinion is way too long for a kids film.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A Great Sequel..........,"I really enjoyed Harry Potter The Sorcerers Stone (Or Philosophers Stone). It had such a magical feel to it and I was super excited watching the sequel. And now watching Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets, it was quite (although not as good as the first film) a great edition to the Harry Potter franchise. I love the continued world building, character development and the continued mysterys of the Wizarding World. Even though the runtime is quite long, it doesn't feel like it's as long as it is. Everything flows well and feels magical. Overall, Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets was a fun sequel and still brings all the hype for this franchise.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Follow the Spiders,"Harry potter and the chamber of secrets was directed by Chris Columbus, and is the 2nd installment in the series. It's harry and the gangs 2nd year Harry eager for his return, soon finds himself wrapped up in a dark mystery that has plagued Hogwarts for the last 50 years. Students are petrified, harry begins hearing strange voices and message are written in blood, all pointing to a single thing the chamber of Secrets. Chamber of secrets continues to capture everything that Stone manages to achieved, and add a even more enticing tale this time around. With the first film establishing Hogwarts, and the basic of the wizarding world, it doesn't have to waste on all that and hops straight into the story. While still have fun and laughs We're giving more of a mystery built around the history of Salazar Slytherin. Everybody still manages to give warming performance's. Harry while still a kid has an once more courage, it shows that he's slowly growing and trying to find his meaning in all this. The film gives also slight more insight on Ron and Hermione life's. It's here where we see the entire Wesley family for the first time, and the kind of people they are very much like Ron. It's was hinted in the first film that Ron clearly didn't have as much money as some of the other students. Regardless though their still a normal loving famliy, happy just trying to get by and have each other. As well with the message of muggleborns with Hermione gives an idea of the class system in the Wizarding community is like in a way hinting at the future events. The Book shop scene says enough when you meet Malfoy again along with his father whose even worst. Just the way Lucius Malfoy speaks it no wonder Draco is the way he is. Dobby at first glace comes off as rather annoying though when you learn more about him you do feel more sympathy toward his actions. The most questionable character of them all Gilderory Lockart(Kenneth Branagh). Not in a bad way he's with out a doubt the funniest in the movie. Branagh is having a blast with this role. This full of himself wizard celebrity, that along the female students just fall for him, and the boy are just like really? I mean really even as kid the second you see this guy you know he's so full of crap, it really makes you wonder how Dumbledore aloud this guy a job as a teacher let alone defense against the dark arts. The visuals still impressive for the time, managing to have that mix of cg though still relaying on it only when necessary. The quidditch matches look way better here the cg doesn't near as stand out as the first film. As well as a transformations that's pretty flawless. The practical effects of the sets and the monster like the Basilisk or Aragog. While still following a similar formula as Sorcerer's Stone. The Chamber of Secrets still has tones of charm to it, and leaves us a on a happy note wanting for the next adventure.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
It's not brilliant yet - it's just damn good,"Still under the helm of Columbus, the franchise thus far maintains its light and child-friendly atmosphere for the most part. Nonetheless, in spite of Columbus' tendency towards the childish and twee, we can see the yummy darkness begin to cast its shadow over Hogwarts.In some ways, it surpasses the first chapter. The visuals are more convincing; the acting, particularly from the children, is starting to improve; and it's a scarier ride overall. However, as of yet, Harry's story lacks emotional depth, which Radcliffe at this age isn't quite ready to let us explore, and doesn't quite live up to its strong visual effects and wondrous ensemble cast. It's not brilliant yet - it's just damn good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The sequel with more depth,"The second is more dark and dramatic than the first, and that's good. I do appreciate more character depth. The transformation spells are cool. The duel is cool.

I'll see you in chambers,"Mesmerizing... hypnotic... spellbinding.  And I awoke after each episode wanting more... sleep!Though I am not a Potter fan, I enjoy a good story. Not having read Ms. Rowling's tales, I felt the need for a synopsis or perhaps subtitles. Though the theater was filled with kids, I should have brought one of my own to make this experience meaningful. My son refuses to go for fear of spoiling his image of the books. A good strong cappuccino may have helped but a more engaging script would make that unnecessary. Sophomore syndrome? Perhaps. Or a DVD version that I could rewind after each snooze and employ subtitles.Memorable scenes? There are a few, like Harry's right arm going flaccid (if you haven't yet seen it, it's not because of that!), the attack of the spiders in which they used a traditional special effect (darkness) and Dobby, a technically captivating elf whose episodes of self-flagellation are overdone.I'm not wild about Harry as you can tell. They haven't picked up on my ""lack of diversity"" criticism from the 'Sorcerer's Stone' - unless I slept through those segments. My favorite character returned - the wizard hat - though his lines were severely cropped.Don't get the impression that I am trying to discourage you from seeing this Harry Potter film. Just do so under the correct conditions. For me, that would be with a kid, before noon, accompanied by a caffeinated beverage, subtitles and a chamber pot.

Complete Triumph,"Ok, so I figured out why i didn't like the first movie.In FACT this is the reason that anyone didn't like the first or second movie. Here is the answer: We all go into the film LOOKING for trouble. We all sit and reread the book before going to see the film, and then leave hating the movie because it was so different to the book, or because it left out a tinsy winsy joke or line. This is not fair. Being overly critical will always end in disaster. But this time, I didn't bother rereading CoS (Mainly due to how much i despise Lockheart and Colin Creevy) and I loved the film.The effects were vastly improved, and Quidditch looked more like people and less like computer graphics. There was a lot more suspense, and the talking in the walls was genuinely creepy. Tom Felton and Jason Isaacs were perfect as Father and son bad guys, and Christian Coulson stole the show with that amazing charm and good looks (and who could forget that cowleck of hair?) and even Alan Rickman looked better as Snape (has he lost weight or is it just me?) The characters are growing up, which is really good to see. Someone told me it was bad, but it shows natural growth. At least these people aren't playing 12 year olds when they are close to 30! Better acting, better graphics, better story (in my opinion) and it flowed pretty well even with the gaps from the book. I suggest that to enjoy this film to its fullest, watch it as a film, not as a book. :) 10/10~",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Very well done!,"I am a huge fan of the books, as is my older daughter, and we both enjoyed the movie extremely much. I believe it captured the book even closer than the first movie, and all the actors have really fallen into their roles perfectly. Columbus does an admirable job pruning the book into the time alloted, and I did not walk away feeling anything was missing, as the few small omissions were not essential to the plot. Branagh was great, and I was hoping he would retain more of the great dialogue he had in the book. I hope that Prisoner of Azkaban, which is probably my favorite of the first four books, is accomplished as well as the this one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

"Better by far than the first, but...","""Chamber of Secrets"" were much better than the first attempt to portray Harry Potter on the Silver Screen. Mind you, we should expect as much, since the actors have become older, more experienced and even mindful of what they are doing. However, I do miss a wider perspective on who Gilderoy Lockhart is, just like I miss the lack of exposure of Snape in the first movie. These are vital persons that would need a wider exposure in the story. Neither movie would lose in becoming a few minutes (10?) longer. The evil Lucius Malfoy, however, was great!

It has more adventure, reveals more secrets of Voldemort, and better effects. A masterpiece -- let's say it like this. However, everything is not that good. Unfurtnanetly, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the movie with more errors in the history of the movies. It counts with more than 250 errors, as seen in the web page, www.moviemistakes.com . But it is still a good movie. The book is also better than the first one, but it's a little bored at the beginning. This movie shows us Harry being warned of great dangers in Hogwarts, however, he still wants to go.

The Chamber of Secrets is a great sequel. It's fun and exciting,"The second movie in the Harry Potter series, The Chamber of Secrets, is a solid follow-up to the first. It kicks off with a strong first act, flows smoothly into an adventurous second act, and ends with the classic Harry-saves-the-day finale. It's entertaining from start to finish and keeps you hooked.The script felt better written this time around. A special shoutout to Ron's parents, played by Mark Williams (Arthur Weasley) and Julie Walters (Molly Weasley), for their great performances. They brought a lot of warmth and humor that made the Weasley family feel so real. The twist in the story was enjoyable and matched the book pretty well, even though, as expected, some details from the book, like the Deathday Party were left out.Dobby, the house-elf, really stood out for me. He added so much to the story and had such a memorable role in saving Harry. They did a fantastic job making him feel alive and expressive. His final moments in the movie were especially satisfying.Overall, The Chamber of Secrets is a great sequel. It's fun, exciting, and keeps building on the magical world introduced in the first film. A must-watch if you're diving into the series.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The second installment brings more depth and intrigue to the Harry Potter world than the first movie.,"Instead of the usual magical excursion we got in the Philosopher's Stone, the Chamber of Secrets immerses us in the mysterious history of Hogwarts, the threats of an invisible enemy, and the past sins of this world. This makes the movie more tense and dynamic. The plot in the second film really begins to show that the Harry Potter story is not just a children's adventure, but something more. The characters grow up and face more complex challenges, which allows us to better feel their journey to maturity. The moment when Harry enters the Chamber of Secrets is full of danger, and the climactic battle with the Basilisk snake is undoubtedly one of the most exciting scenes in the early films of the series. I would also like to note that this movie looks better visually than the first one, and the world of magic seems more mature and thoughtful.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Second film is a really good extension of the first,"Being the 2nd, in what will be a 7 film franchise, Chamber of Secrets was basically more of the same with another year added to the kids. The dark overtones that will dominate the later films was introduced here, as is the growing uneasiness by everyone in regard to Harry's potential power and how he will use it.All the kids raise the bar another notch in their performances. The effects, though sometimes dodgy, adequately convey the magic and wonder that Harry is experiencing. Williams is back for another stab at the score and again delivers in spades.We once again get a new professor against the dark arts, which I gather from the films, is a rotating storyline through the books. It seems to be used to introduce new characters, though it would seem in the case on Kenneth Branaghs character, it is a one-shot deal. Pity, I could see his character being one that could be explored delightfully. I really enjoyed the inclusion of Luscious Malfoy played excellently by Jason Issac's.My one on-going complaint with all the films is the lack of character exploration in regard to Snape and Dumbledore. You know there is a lot more than what we are seeing, yet the films continue to introduce more new characters that take up time that I would love to see spent on Snape and Dumbledore. Not sure if this is how the books are, but it is a disappointing aspect of the films for me.I really enjoyed this film and looked forward with great anticipation to the 3rd.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Definitely Delivers!,"No one will be disappointed with the second film of the Harry Potter movies.

Not a sequel -- but a continuation.,"Just as exciting as the first film this episode adds more humour and darkness to the story.With most of the same actors as the first film this latest edition of the `Harry Potter' franchise is just as visually exciting -- if not more so.Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint reprise their roles as the talented young magicians enrolled at the Hogwart School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Alan Rickman and David Bradley return as the professors and staff at the school and are just as good as they were in the first -- though more of the focus of this episode is on the characters of Harry Potter, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley.Kenneth Branaugh is a delightful addition to the cast as the egotistical and very inept Gilderoy Lockhart.The overall look and visual appeal is different -- though just as brilliantly executed as the first film.Once again the genius of John Williams provides the superb score that underlies the action and mood of the film.It was nice to see the film open with the very unsympathetic characters of Harry's Uncle, Aunt and cousin -- they added a strong link to the first film that would have been sorely missed were it not there.Christopher Columbus would seem to be a marvelous director of children's films -- apparently he understands the awe and amazement that a child would have if they were in situations similar to the ones that our heroes are in.This installment of the franchise is much darker and a great deal scarier than the first -- just as the book was.  I am not sure if it is suitable for all children; but if your children are mature enough to realize that this is just a film and they will not wake up screaming with visions of giant spiders and snakes -- then it will be appropriate for them.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
This is a more entertaining and intense film than the first movie and is an absolutely must see,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002) is a movie I recently rewatched for the first time in a long time with my daughter. The storyline follows Harry returning to a darker Hogwarts. There is a plague threatening the school that is leaving students paralyzed. Many believe it is because of a old curse inside a room within the school. Due to a pure blood wizard being part of the school for the first time in decades the room is now open and something has come out. Harry and friends will research the details of the old story of how the room came to be and try to save the school from whatever has come out...This movie is directed by Chris Columbus (Rent) and stars Daniel Radcliffe (Horns), Emma Watson (Beauty and the Beast), Jason Isaacs (Black Hawk Down), Rupert Grint (Moonwalkers), John Cleese (A Fish Called Wanda), Alan Rickman (Diehard), Richard Griffiths (The History Boys) and Toby Jones (The Mist).The storyline for this was a bit darker than the first film and provided far more insights on the characters and the sinister ways of those who may be against Potter. The fights are far more intense and fun to watch. The new characters were also fun, especially Dobby and Myrtle. The sequences getting to the school are always magical and the classroom lessons and school games (quidditch) are always fun. The ending is very smart, intense and the characters involved are excellent.Overall this is a more entertaining and intense film than the first movie and is an absolutely must see. I would score this a 9/10 and strongly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Chamber of Secrets owns the Sorcerer's Stone.,"I recently got into Harry Potter, after seeing the Sorcerer's Stone. The first one was really good. The Chamber of Secrets, however, was a greater accomplishment. I heard nothing but good about this movie, and I got even more than what I had expected. I didn't expect this movie to be as great as it was. I thought it would be good, but not THIS good.Richard Harris' illness was apparent in this movie, as his voice was raspier than it was in the original. Rest in peace, Richard Harris. Your final movie was great.I also noticed the kids have grown up a bit. This made the movie seem less like a kid's movie than the first.I'm not going to go as far as to say this was better than LOTR (like someone foolishly said), but Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets SHOULD be among IMDb's top 250.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A Magical Upgrade That Will Leave You Spellbound,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is undeniably superior to the first film, and let's be honest, it's hard to argue otherwise. The three main leads have truly stepped into their roles-Harry, Ron, and Hermione have gone from cute, budding actors to fully realized characters. While they're still not likely to snag any Oscars, the growth in their performances is palpable. I remember watching the first film thinking, ""Aw, look at these adorable kids,"" but now they are Harry, Ron, and Hermione.The new characters were fantastic, with every addition bringing something special to the table-Dobby included. I'll admit, I was skeptical when I first saw him in the trailers, but I ended up loving him. As for the other newcomers, Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy was the perfect picture of a slimy villain. Bonnie Wright as Ginny Weasley had a much more prominent role this time around, and she did an excellent job, truly impressing me. Christian Coulson's portrayal of Tom Riddle was nothing short of captivating, and Kenneth Branagh's turn as the pompous Gilderoy Lockhart was pure comedic gold.Even if you're not a hardcore Harry Potter fan, this movie has something for everyone. It's packed with thrills-spiders, snakes, and the ominous Whomping Willow-and delivers tons of laughs, thanks to Rupert Grint's comedic timing as Ron and Branagh's hilarious performance as Lockhart.As for the trio of leads-Daniel Radcliffe (Harry), Rupert Grint (Ron), and Emma Watson (Hermione)-they've matured since the last film. This is a good thing, of course, since Harry and his friends are supposed to grow along with the story. Harry's newfound good looks have started to attract attention, Ron remains irresistibly adorable, and Hermione has blossomed into a very pretty young lady. I was pleased to see that Hermione's appearance aligned more with the book description, complete with her big teeth, and Ron has finally surpassed the others in height, likely thanks to Rupert Grint's age.However, there was one slight disappointment for me as a die-hard Harry Potter fan-Sean Biggerstaff's portrayal of Oliver Wood didn't quite live up to my expectations. While I still think he's incredibly charming, he didn't quite capture the fiery, competitive spirit of Wood as I had imagined.For those who may feel like the film moves a bit fast, I recommend watching it a second time. It's a much more enjoyable experience the second time around, and you'll appreciate it more.In summary, Chamber of Secrets is a delightful experience that I would recommend to anyone-from gothic teens to busy adults. I can't wait to see it again with my mother, as I've already seen it twice in just three days. Even if you weren't a fan of the first movie, I'm confident you'll enjoy this one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Another great movie adaption based upon the book!!!,"As with the first film, I loved this film. It was so close to the book that all the magic I had when reading the book was brought back to life in this film.One of the first things I noticed about this film was the dark plot that was realized in full detail by Director Chris Columbus. He did such an excellent job in the first film that I knew he would do the same for the sequel.Dobby was a great character for the book series and was a great character in the film. I really enjoyed the scenes where Dobby and Harry were together, it was cute.

And of course I cant forget to mention the marvelouse Richard Harris as Hogwarts Head Marster, Albus Dumbledor, and it was an extreme tragedy when Richard Harris died a little while after the release of 'Chamber of Seacrets' on to DVD and VHS. i think it is safe to say that Richard Harris made the character Albus Dumbledor what he is today. As a fan i can say honestly that, like other fans i await the release of the rest of the Harry Potter books on to the big screen, however I don't know how thay will replace the awesome talent of Richard Harris, but they will shurly be great films none the less.

Year 2 at Hogwarts and things start to unravel at quite a pace!,"Continuing with my annual Harry Potter binge watch, it was time to watch Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets over the weekend; one of the personal favourites out of the whole franchise. The second instalment picks up a couple of months after the first ends: it's the summer holidays prior to Harrys second year at Hogwarts and he is miserably living back at his Aunt and Uncles house. Harry is visited by a house elf named Dobby who tries to warn him that for his own safety he shouldn't return to school for the following year. The start of this movie also shows us our first glimpse of the Weasley household, Ron's Parents and Draco Malfoys father. Once Harry arrives at Hogwarts, the movie has a very similar feel to the first one; We are taken through the school year at a nice pace with plenty of things happening and several instances where Harry, Ron and Hermione find themselves in the wrong place at wrong time. The chemistry and on screen friendship of Harry, Ron and Hermione grows during this movie and makes for a much better experience as you start to see their personalities much more. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets contains all the values you expect from a Harry Potter movie. Friendship, loyalty and courage are the base of the movies messages and it does a fantastic job of appealing to children and adults alike. Near enough all the cast return from the previous movie and we also get to see several extra characters who slot right into the movie effortlessly. The final scene of this movie is more effective and better made than the first movie and for the first time we get a glimpse of what's to come from Lord Voldermort. We also get some back story through a series of flashbacks which help us gain a better understanding of Lord voldermort and leave us with questions which will be answered in the later movies! I find it hard to write reviews for movies which are in a series as I don't like to give anything away, I won't say anymore now other than, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a very well made movie with a long run time which doesn't drag at all. I personally prefer this one to the first and out of all 8 movies its certainly one of my favourites. 9/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
MUCH better than the first,"I wasn't even going to go see this movie after the disaster of the first one, but ended up going with friends.  My main problem with the first movie was the omission of several scenes which are key to the plot, and Columbus seems to have sorted this out with number 2.  Ok, many scenes are missing, which are in the book, but the ones left out this time don't form part of the crucial chain in the story.CGI, and SFX in general, is much better also than in the first film, although the flying car is a bit like a 1960s kids TV programme.  The spiders and Dobby are excellent, as is the remainder of the CG aspects.  The acting could still do with some improvement, though.Overall, 8 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
definitely worth your money,"Nice and entertaining movie, a must see because of the charming story. Even though this movie is full of special effects, you really ought to see it because of the story.

Harray! A step-up from the first!,"'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' follows a similar tale of events to the 'Philosopher's Stone' movie however is superior in almost every aspect.Darker in ambiance, larger in scale, more daring, more interesting and an awesome climax. These are the ways in which the 'Chamber of Secrets' improves on its predecessor; this is largely due to the stimulus from Rowling although credit to Columbus for anchoring a darkened atmosphere and marking the whole package an intriguing piece.With Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) in preparation for his second year at Hogwarts, Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths) refuse to allow him to go following Dobby the house elf's (Toby Jones) antics at a family meeting. Knowing magic was used, they believe Harry to be the culprit. When, Ron (Rupert Grint) and his family rescue him though, he and Ron are unable to make it to Gate 8 3/4 when someone has tampered with its wall portal. As they make it to Hogwarts later than expected, dark forces return to Hogwarts once more. Once more, Harry looks to save the day and believes using Tom Riddle's diary, he can get to the bottom of the sinister goings-on.The films ambiance is - like I've already stated - rather dark, in comparison to its predecessor and parent may want to consider whether any young children should be given the freedom to watch it.Other than the above, this film will suit the majority of audiences as Columbus once more succeeds in completing another successful installment of Rowling's Potter novels, before distributing it on film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A great and interesting masterpiece,"If you were looking for a movie which dug deep into the history and legend of Hogwarts then you should look no further!! The Chamber of Secrets makes the audience know how deep the Harry Potter universe is and all the things within. it also had a good flavour to it which will make you watch this movie once you have started watching it and will surely make you a Potterhead if you love the magical world, very less movies are out there which are as perfect and as good as this one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A solid adaptation,Another solid movie from Chris Columbus. He did well with these early small books and they suited his style well. One thing I didn't mention on my previous review is how great all of the casting for this series is. Even the smaller parts like Filch are played to perfection. Yes some of the kids are still learning but I don't think they're that bad and the adults are really the cream of British actors.,9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Magical Fun, though lacking the same Energy of its Predecessor,","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a very talented cast. It's a magical adventure that takes us back to Hogwarts with Harry in his second year, with darker elements being explored, the history and landscape of the school is expanded from our very own eyes, we discover in this movie just how large and innovative this universe truly is. It's certainly not as enjoyable as its predecessor, the Philospher's Stone, was, though I like the darker themes, I felt as if it didn't gradually become more bleak, we went from the fun laid back atmosphere of the first movie, to a much more severe and complicated one here, I was disappointed with the lack of development from Hermione in this film, though Harry and Ron's character arch is further established fantastically here, Hermione isn't in it enough and her character is basically the exact same at the end of this as she was in the previous movie. There are plenty of great new characters here as well that further shows us what this universe is capable of, Dobby the House Elf, Lucius Malfoy and Gilderoy Lockhart, among many others, and terrific characters that are superbly portrayed by their actors, and they all add more depth to this amazing universe. Though it may be too dark at times and not quite as fun as its predecessor, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is still a great ride and fun for the whole family.Strange events start to occur around Hogwarts and a mysterious voice haunt Harry's head, he must investigate these occurrences while in his second year of Hogwarts.Best Performance: Daniel Radcliffe",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Better than the first.,"'Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone', being the first in a series, suffered from the problem of exposition: by having to explain the rules and denizens of an all-new world it left its own plots and thrills to be short-changed.  On its own, it just didn't pack enough punch.The second movie in the series, 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets', doesn't have that problem.  It can get rolling from the first frames right on through into the thrilling climax sequences, and benefits greatly from the familiarity.  We already know who the characters are, we've already seen most of Hogwart's School, and we have an idea of what to expect.  Director Chris Columbus and screenwriter Steve Kloves, adapting this book as closely and faithfully as they did the first one, don't let us down.  High adventure and high drama unfold on the screen.There are changes.  First and foremost are the physical changes in the young cast members, most notably in the boys.  Daniel Radcliffe (Harry), Rupert Grint (Ron) and Tom Felton (Harry's nemesis Draco) all have grown like weeds and had their voices drop into that grainy in-between range that hits all teenaged boys.  For some, especially Felton, the growth spurts help their performances (Draco Malfoy is now a lot taller and even more sinister.  He's no longer a kid playing at being nasty - he just is.).  Emma Watson (Hermione) doesn't have as drastic a change, but she does seem more comfortable in her role.  Given a part that swings wildly from sedate to obnoxious, she has reined in her extremes far better than she did in 'Sorceror's Stone'.  Radcliffe is also more confident as Harry, though a little uneven in his reactions to his surroundings.  Still, as he's in almost every scene, he handles himself quite well.  Grint, the best comic actor of the three leads, gets a few chances to show his stuff here, but like Watson, is less a part of the story this time around - it's pretty much Harry's movie.Returning from the first film are the main adult roles, as well.  Alan Rickman (Snape) is as drily dark as ever; Maggie Smith (MacGonagall) and Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid) return, but have precious little to do in this installment.  The late Richard Harris (Dumbledore) is given more depth and substance here - as he will be throughout the series - and is wonderful with his balance of whimsy and wisdom.  He'll be sorely missed, and terribly difficult to replace.New additions on the adult side include the arrogant and narcissitic Godefroy Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh, delightfully hamming up every single scene), and Draco's father Lucius Malfoy, a malevolent force of darkness (Jason Isaacs, seeming to enjoy himself almost as much as Branagh).  The best thing you can say about the adults is that they all seem to be having a blast doing these pictures, in a way that proves acting is not a chore or a burden - but a ton of fun.The events in 'Chamber of Secrets' are darker and more dangerous than the first film, as Harry discovers deeper plots than before.  There are some scenes that probably aren't appropriate for the really young children in the audience, but most of the older kids have seen much worse in lesser pictures.  The event pieces are good thrills and well-executed:  best are the flying car hurtling towards Hogwart's; the spider encounter in the Dark Forest, and the penultimate battle with the serpentine basilisk inside the Chamber itself.It's a fun ride, more focused on the plots and twists than the first film was, though still prone to drawing out the action in the same style as the book.  There's not much reason to mess with a good thing, but Columbus will probably take some hits for a lack of originality in his direction.  So what?  It's still a very enjoyable film, and should satisfy Harry Potter fans quite nicely.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Even better than the first one...The magic is alive...,"Being a huge fan of the Harry Potter books, it's so great to be able to see them come to life on the screen. And although I did think at first that my own image of the books might be destroyed by an unworthy actor's portrayal, the movies made so far have been alarmingly close to what I'd imagined the books to be like. So, it was great when I went to the theater with the expectations of the first movie, only to be shocked that the second movie has out done my expectations. We can only hope that when the reins are handed over to another director that the finished product will live up to its predecessors. Although I am over twenty, I must admit to being an unabashed reader of the Harry Potter books. I really hope that the next five movies to be made will be as true to J.K.

Didn't let me down,"I went to see this the day it came out, with some trepidation. As an Englishman living in Canada and having a Foster daughter who is fed up with me telling her how good British Movies are - this one had a lot to live up to. We have read all the books and await the next book with eager anticipation. I went to the local Cinema (sorry - Movie Theatre) and it was packed with mostly young teens and pre-teenagers. They all sat still and maintained their interest for 2 hours 41 minutes (was it really that long?). Many jumped at the frightening parts and many laughed at the funny parts (me loudest of all). There just wasn't enough of Hagrid and poor old Albus (Richard Harris)was showing that his illness was more serious than the last film - but we all loved the film and were talking about the good bits as we left the theatre. Some achievement! To translate the books and to keep the magic must be difficult but it succeeds. The film was slightly over-long and we were suffering from some discomfort because our seats weren't the best, and the ending was a bit of an anti-climax (should have had more humour, I think) - but - whatever. This is one for the kid in all of us. Get out there and see it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A great children's film.,"This is a children's film I am happy to say that I am a fan of. One of the best things about this movie is its visuals, which are superb. It looks like the film may have been treated differently than normal. But the school, the quidditch field, and the chamber itself are all very well done. Hermione is as childlishly practical (although not as cute) as the first film. Radcliffe shows loads of improvement in his acting abilities (he was somewhat cheesy in the first film, but to a certain extent it's hard not to be in a film like these films) My favorite scene is the sequence where Tom Riddle shows Harry his capture of Hagrid. The greyscale brownish look is very effective (although I think they should have cast someone besides Harris to play young Dumbledore, and perhaps dubbed in his voice later.) This film is a great cap to Harris's career, and I am sure to miss him in the later installments. This film is not as much a film for all ages as the Pixar films, but is nonetheless worth a look.8/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Nostalgia,"I love Chamber of Secrets. To me, it's the last Potter film to make me feel nostalgic towards the series. Don't get me wrong, I love all 8 films, but there's something about the campy and all around goofiness to Chamber of Secrets that makes it all the more endearing.Even though it was filmed merely months after the first film was released; Harry, Ron, and Hermione feel like they have grown so much since their first outing at Hogwarts. I guess that's the feeling you get when you watch the films within days of each other. With that said, we are jumped right back into the fold as Harry is back with his muggle family in England when a house elf, named Dobby, appears and warns him to never return back to Hogwarts. Being that it's the confident and curious Harry Potter we're talking about, of course he makes his way back to the school within a few scenes.Much like the first film, we have plenty of entertaining side missions for the trio to go on which included; a flying car, taking a potion to disguise themselves as Slytherin, following spiders into the dark forest, and of course some Quidditch. All of this makes for a brisk 2 hours and 40 minutes of wizard fun. But the film isn't short on its eerie reveals, adventurous thrills, and dark storytelling.Chamber of Secrets brilliantly balances all of that though. Seeing Harry venture into the secrets of Tom Riddle's diary is some terrifying stuff to see as a kid, as is seeing various victims picked off in Hogwarts due to the Chamber being open. And to me, it holds up to this day. There's definitely a more childish tone to it all, but these are 12-year-olds after all.This film was also a test for Harry, and particularly Daniel Radcliffe, to show if he can truly carry a film or not. Hermione is sidelined for the last 40 minutes or so and Ron is just about scared of anything they come across. If there was ever a question to that proposal, Chamber of Secrets definitely put that to rest. The first film is great, but this was Harry and Radcliffe coming into their own as character and actor respectively. From here on out it's a much darker and relentlessly thrilling take on the character, so I'll always be partial to the lighter tone Chamber of Secrets presented.+Balances goofy and gripping scenes well+Chamber fight+Unsettling reveals+Plenty of entertaining missions for the trio9.0/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Good continuation to the series,"'Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets' continue in the way pointed by the first HP film, being it has the same director and all.HPatCoS goes thorough the second year of Harry's schooling in Hogwarts, this time the menace comes from the chamber mentioned in the title. Woldemort has figured out a way of getting himself a brand new body using that place.Actors are the same as in the first film, though the kids have grown a bit older. That was the reason the makers were in a hurry of making the first two films in a row. The acting is fine and the child actors carry their load through the film rather painlessly, obviously having fun by doing it.Special effects are okay, but not spectacular in all places. The Argog in example isn't the most glorious display of CGI, though it doesn't look completely dreadful, only a bit awkward. But the overall quality of effects is okay, and the gnome Dobby is very well executed little creature.Over all The Chamber of Secrets is a good continuation to the series.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Both Much of What is Right and Much of What is Wrong with the First Movie is also Present Here,"As luck would have it, Chamber of Secrets has more of a story sweep than its forerunner, though it lacks much determination or tension. But, most importantly, it does preserve the light-hearted sense of humor and childlike buoyancy that made the first film entertaining. The humor is slightly on the mawkish side this time, and Columbus hasn't decided against tacking on another winning-is-good wrap-up, this time even more peppered with honey-baked schmaltz than last time, but the light-hearted youthful nature of the material is still intact and keeps it engaging even for those of us who haven't seen it in nearly ten years.This second annual production design festival starts with Harry reuniting with Hermione and Ron, and his arch-rival, Tom Felton's Draco, as they prepare for sophomore year at Hogwarts. Many of the old faculty return, including Dumbledore, the stringent McGonagall, and the gloomy, hostile Snape. There's a new recruit, a totally engaging Kenneth Branagh as the charming, narcissistic Gilderoy Lockhart, who is more engrossed in fan mail than teaching defense against the dark arts. But all's not sound at Hogwarts. A sinister conspiracy is looming, with someone plotting to burglarize the renowned Chamber of Secrets and let loose a monster. It's up to Harry and his mates to expose the perpetrator before Hogwarts finishes.All real inspiration motivating this hat-in-hand outing is rooted in Rowling's original ideas. The Harry Potter stories don't break new ground, but they merge time-honored fantasy blueprints into a breezy, creative and contagious concoction, but Columbus isn't poised to make any real leaps with the material, and periodically this suit-following sequel seems more like processed merchandise than a live, three-dimensional film. It pleases, meets expectations, but doesn't blow one's mind.All of the unforgettable moments happen in the powerfully dynamic latter half of the movie, including an staggeringly accomplished gathering of giant, inhospitable spiders and a likewise arresting encounter with a massive snake. These scenes, with their perfect virtual worlds and graphic effects, minify even the most imposing sequence from the first movie. The film's other significant effect is Dobby the computer-generated House Elf, who at once manages to be little more compelling and a little less grating than Jar-Jar Binks, sans minstrelsy.Radcliffe, Watson and Grint are more self-possessed and practiced than in their previous excursion, especially Grint, who has settled impeccably into the role of the more hapless, more neurotic comic relief. Branagh had been below the radar in the past few years. It's refreshing to see him burst back into the public interest with something this pleasant. The other noteworthy add-on is Jason Isaacs, who admits emits unadulterated wickedness, as Draco's father, Lucius.Indeed, much of what made the first film so charming stays resolutely primed, from the strapping ensemble performances to Stuart Craig's impressive production design. The atmosphere of invention, that early interface with the stories' vibrant characters and quirky corresponding world, is absent. In its place comes frenetic commotion. As companion pieces, Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets interlock perfectly. Not shocking, bearing in mind that many of the same people were responsible for both.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

My only complaint was not with the film but with the classification it belong to. When I watched the film there were a couple of kids around the age of 7-10 and they were terrified during the movie. Scenes with giant snakes and giant spiders are a little too much for young children. Parent who are not familiar with Harry Potter can bring young children to the movies causing endless weeks of nightmares. I hope that for the next two Harry Potters the movies become PG 13 specially for the Goblet of Fire where one of the students dies. Overall a very nice film 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
GENIUS SEQUEL,"A great sequel!
If you liked the first one then you're going to love this! There's a darker atmosphere this time around and more characters are introduced including Gilderoy Lockhart (hilariously played by Kenneth Branagh), Draco Malfoy's father, Lucius (a great performance by Jason Isaacs, exactly how I imagined the character from the books!), Ron's father, Arthur, and the mysterious Dobby the house elf (fortunately he isn't anywhere near as annoying as other CG characters in other movies, but I won't name any names... *cough*JarJarBinks*cough*)The movie sticks closely to the novel, but as in the last movie we miss some of those scenes where we start to learn a little more about the characters, especially the hate-hate relationship between Harry and Professor Snape (who was seriously underused in this movie!)All in all it's definitely worth checking out, the running time of 160 minutes may seem a little long but it doesn't seem that long when you're watching it. By the way, whatever you do DO NOT leave until the credits have ended, otherwise you'll miss a little extra treat...",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Chamber of Wows,"I had waited all summer for this movie and I was so excited when it came out!     I was very impressed with Gilderoy Lockhart! Kennith is a very good actor and he created quite the up-roar with Alan Rickman. Though Kennith performance was great, Alan  will always be the best!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Pretty Good Second Installment,"The second Harry Potter film follows Harry and friends through their sophomore year at Hogwarts, the mystical school for young wizards. As has been stressed, now that the ground rules have firmly been established in the first film, the second can focus on deeper character development and plotting. And so it does. Hogwarts, wizards, magic, and all the rest of the J.K. Rowling milieu are taken for granted. They play a Quidditch match without having to explain the rules.Chris Columbus does a great job with the actors, sets, and special effects. Again, we're transporting to a different universe with its own rules and characters. And it works well, its style reminding me of the adventure movies of the 30s, 40s and 50s.  It's a rich mix, but probably much more so for kids that adults. I have only one caution.As an unread Harry fan, I found the plotting unoriginal. Of course, Harry Potter books and movies are for kids, so let's keep it simple. My fear is that the series will reduce itself to Scooby-Doo style rubber stamp stories, one just like the other. Maybe I'd better read them first, to allay my fears.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Exceeds All Of My Expectations,"Having been a huge fan of the first movie and of the books, I had nothing but high hopes for The Chamber of Secrets.  I must say that this film exceeded every one of my expectations.All of the performances in the film were top notch, especially Rupert Grint, who played Ron.  He was so much better in this film than in The Sorcerer's Stone.  Some great new casting was done.  Kenneth Branagh was perfectly cast as the inept Gilderoy Lockhart, and Jason Isaacs slid perfectly into the role of the slimy Lucius Malfoy.  And even Dobby the House Elf, who was being touted as the next Jar Jar, was very well done.The film is much, much darker than the first in every aspect.  And the final fight between Harry and The Basilisk is a sight to behold.  Speaking of The Basilisk, the special effects in this film went well beyond the effects of the first.  They seemed much more realistic.All in all, this is a simply wonderful film that should be treasured for years and years to come.  I highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a good time.Note: This film, although rated PG, definitely pushes the boundaries(in my opinion, it does) of this rating, and I strongly caution parents who bring their child to see it, it will scare your child.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
perfect and more mature sequel and similar to Lord of the Rings sequels,"This movie and sequel is similar in development to Lord of the Rings sequels, the similar magic movie. There are more mature characters. which are ironically having the same situation in their real life outside of acting. Therefore very convincing and realistic. Although bit too amateur for adult watchers, it is perfect for it's release date and best for people who already read a book, played a game, and watched previous sequel. Bit more complicated and mature than 1st sequel, but nothing too much, too quick, or too harsh.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Maybe third time is the charm,"I think it is the third time I see this movie. I think. This time it was with my kids. We had a great time and even the basilisk didn't spoil it with his large fangs. Retrospectively, this movie grows great and doesn't get old. Maybe this is why I thought it is even better this time then last two times I watched it - every decade or so...Harry's second chapter in Hogwarts gets hardcore and as in the book, this time a death danger is upon all the pupils in the school. The story is well known and also well executed by Chris Columbus and his team. Just watch how many young actors we got from this one and how many fine veterans are also staring in this film - even for a short period - job well done.Though it is getting darker it is still OK to watch with your little ones and though it is the longest of all the movies, you cannot stop watching it and this emphasize its charm and magic best of all.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

GREAT MOVIE!!!!!!!!!,"This movie was way better than the first one! It didn't stay as true to the book as the first one, but still it was really good. Although the Basilisk, in my opinion, looked just weird. It was almost nothing like I imagined it. The actors did a better job acting and the special effects were great! I loved Gilderoy Lockhart in the movie. He was just soooo funny!^_^ If you love the books then I think you will like this movie. Bring on the third one!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Chamber of Secrets,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is another good movie in the series and picks right up off of the first. I don't personally think it had the same magical feel to it as the first but it is still very good. They do a really good job bringing the story to life and making you feel enchanted throughout. The quality also seems to be getting better after the first one and only increase as the series gets more steam. I do think this movie is more of a ""filler"" movie and not one of the absolute pillars of the series like others are. But nonetheless, a great movie and part of one of the best series ever.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Far better than the first.,"I am an avid fan of the Harry Potter books, and when the first movie was released, I was disgusted and very disapointed. When I saw The Chamber of Secrets, I was very much afraid of a similar disgrace on J.K. Rowling's masterpiece. Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised. The actors have grown-up and into their roles, giving th acting a more believable edge, and the film was much closer to what it should be. The only disapointment was not incredibly terrible - I thought that the basilisk looked not enough like a snake and too much like a dragon without legs.  But all in all, I believe that I enjoyed this movie more than I did the book itself.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

One of the More Underrated Harry Potter Films,"I don't understand why this film barely gets any love from Harry Potter fans. I know it's near three-hour runtime can tire some people out, but it my opinion it never got boring, and there was always something interesting going on. I even consider it a better film than the first, altough I'm sure that's a pretty hot take.

Great sequel!,"Daniel Radcliffe stars once again as the Boy who Lived in this exciting and magical sequel to Chris Columbus's excellent fantasy based off the novels by J.K. Rowling. Still has plenty of great visuals and exciting scenes, and continues the wonderful music score by John Williams. Although doesn't have has much of a strong feeling as the first, it still holds out as a worthy sequel.After an incident with a house elf in his bedroom, causing Harry to get into trouble by his step parents, Harry escapes with Ron and his brothers in their flying car. He then lands into more trouble when the gateway to the Hogwarts express is blocked off, forcing them to take the flying car. As Harry continues his life in Hogwarts, attacks of people start happening, leading them to suspect that a hidden chamber in the castle may be the cause of it.Filled with different subplots, but after awhile, they'll conjoin into one. The casting is still great, with all the same actors still portraying their characters well. Once again, brilliantly covers the main topics of the book, and still manages to get its own material. The thing that made the first better is how clever the story begins. Regardless, this one greatly continues the series, with references to the first, as well as finding ways for things from last year to change.Also becomes a little more modern, and less fashionable with everything. Suspense is very clever, with one thing to another, leading you to curiosity beyond everything. It becomes well explained about everything. Once again, you will enjoy it even if you haven't read the book, but for those who did will pretty much know everything.An excellent sequel, though doesn't surpass the first, not by its flaws, but by the strength that the first gave. It has its ups and downs, but overall a worthy and exciting sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
This Is a Wonderful Film !,"I loved Harry Potter and The Sorcerers Stone. I read the book first of course and when I went to see the movie, I did not expect to see so much of the magical things from the book. I was surprised and pleasantly gratified. Well, moving on, I recently went to observe the new Harry Potter movie The Chamber of Secrets. The movie was wonderful! The loyalty Harry Potter had for Professor Dumbledore, it was heart warming. The Spiders seemed very real and the flying car was something I did not expect would be in the movie. Harry was very brave in the battle between him and ""Tom Riddle'.  I cannot wait until the next movie, The Prisoner of Azkaban.Thank You,Anitra Rain",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Much better than the first.,"Direction was better, acting was better, special effects were better than the first.Funny thing about expectations is that they are often wrong. I expected the Sorcerer's Stone to be great because of all the hype. I was bored. It was very disappointing. I go to the Chamber of secrets expecting another lackluster,less than state of the art special effects,run of the mill B movie and again I'm wrong. From beginning to end the movie had my full attention. It's one of those flicks that the smell of fresh popcorn,wafting with the fragrance of melted butter won't get me out of my seat because I didn't want to miss a single scene. That's big in my ratings book. The fist Harry Potter I think I went out to blow my nose. I just didn't care what happened next. Watching Secrets I couldn't wait for the next scene. Big difference in how good a movie is. I must tell you that I have never read any of the Potter books so I don't know how true the movies relate. I felt that I didn't waste $8.75. If you have some time on your hands go see this one. It's worth it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Solid follow-up!,"A year after Harry Potter (Daniel Redcliffe) had found the Sorcerer's Stone, it seems this is the second year for the Boy Who Lived for him at Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardy. Dobby (Voiced by Toby Jones) is a house-elf that warns Harry of terrible dangers that await for the boy at Hogwart's but the boy doesn't listen to him for he goes back to the school. He is reunited with Hermoine (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grinn) but at this school year it seems some of the students have disappeared and petrified mysteriously with more weird things like bloody threat writings on the walls and a monster on the loose. Despite all this stuff, there could be a legendary Chamber of Secrets within in the school that has been hidden for years as the three must try to find it or the other students will be gone.Superb second installment of the brilliant big-screen fantasy adaptation movie series of the superb books by JK Rowling. Quite faithful to the book but missing some of the uniqueness that made the book great but it's still a fantastic and very dark movie that manages to surpass the first movie as that was an introduction to the characters. Here Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Tom Felton, and the rest of the cast from the first movie are reunited with some new characters like Jason Issacs as Malfoy's father, Kenneth Brangah as Gildroy Lockheart and Miriam Margoyles as Professor Sprout.

The Chamber Rocks!,"Chris Columbus has managed a feat rarely acheived by others - he has made a sequel that is better than the original.  ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" flies out of the starting gate (in a Ford Anglia, no less!) and doesn't stop for its 2 hr 42 minute running time (Peter Jackson, take notes!).  From the opening moments of Harry and the Weasleys in the flying car, to Harry and Malfoy battling in the dueling club (did they make parcel-tongue sound cool or what?!), to Harry's confrontation with Lucious Malfoy (which had the audience I watched the film with cheering!), ""Chamber"" is thrilling, magical, and quite funny - the latter due largely in part to Rupert Grint's comic portrayal of Ron Weasley. In fact, all the kids are great in their roles; Daniel Radcliffe plays Harry with much more bravo and daring than in ""Sorceror's Stone"", and as a result, makes a quite a good action hero.  Emma Watson's character of Hermione Granger is more laid-back this time (though she doesn't really have a whole lot to do - the boys get all the great action scenes!).  And it's quite touching to see the special relationship that exists between Harry, Ron, and Hermione as played by these actors; the characters genuinely care about each other and acknowledge each others strengths.  The only flaw - which existed in the first film too - is that the more humorous scenes in the book are not in the movie (i.e, the scenes at the Borrough, and A LOT of Gildaroy Lockhart's scenes - which leaves Kenneth Branaugh with not much to do either).  But still, the film is a great ride from start to finish - a great job done by all those involved. Kudos!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The weakest film in the franchise!,"Yes, this is probably the weakest movie in the franchise... Does it mean it's bad? Absolutely not, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets managed to deliver entertainment! The only problem is that the movies is too long, it's the longest Harry Potter movie with its 2 hours and 40 minutes.It begins well, amazing scenes with the flying car and Weasleys' house. The fun starts from the beginning, with other words. But the story is not as enjoyable as the story in the first movie. It gets too tedious, it always happens stuff but I got a little bored when the end never came.The acting are as brilliant as the first movie, if not even better. Scenery is amazing as well. But the movie doesn't seem as important as the others, it doesn't give so much to the franchise except some things about Harry. It doesn't feel lika a fill movie, more like they still want to clear the things that wasn't clear in the first movie.When the ending finally came, you won't be disappointed. It's a good ending with much excitement. Even if it's far from the best ending in the franchise, probably the worst one. But still a good one!

Excellent follow-up to the 1st movie in the series,"I really enjoyed the Chamber of Secrets movie. Its an excellent sequel! The 2 new faces that really stood out for me were Jason Isaacs (Mr. Lucius Malfoy), and Kenneth Branaugh (Prof. Lockhart).  Isaacs just radiates EVIL in his portrayal, and I don't think anyone could have played the pompous, egotistical Lockhart any better than Branaugh.  The 3 kids were all much better in their roles.  I particularly enjoyed the many facial expressions of Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley), who seems to have that skill down pat!Now that I've seen it once, I will probably go back and see it again a couple times, as I did the 1st HP movie.  There's just so much you pick up on the 2nd or 3rd time.If I had to list any ""gripes"", it would be for a few things that transgressed the novel, but, I guess you have to give in to a few of these things when material goes to the big screen ... artistic impression and all that.  Of course, loads of scenes weren't even in the movie, but they are all in my head, since I've read the novel many times, as well as all the HP books.A very enjoyable experience.  Though the movie is 2:41 long, it barely felt like an hour and a half.  Well, I hear that the DVD will have an additional 18 minutes on it, so that will be just fine with me!

Just wow!,"I liked the second book and the movie more than the first, and I reread and revised them more often. After all, the first part is so ""introductory"" in nature, because it introduces us to the hero, his story and the magical world.In the second part, we are already faced with more dynamic events. The intrigue is becoming more and more obvious, and the film smoothly turns not just into a fairy tale, but into a whole magical detective story.

Somebody teach these kids how to act ...,"Sorry, but if I have to see Rupert Grint try to act perplexed/terrified one more time, I'm going to take his broken wand and shove it up where the sun don't shine.And Daniel Radcliffe may look like the kid on the cover of the books, but the cartoon kid shows more believable emotions.  What a pity that this huge behemoth of a ""franchise"" rests on such poor actors.  Give us a couple of really good child actors and maybe it'd work.  Plenty of grown-ups disagree I'm sure, and that's OK.  Peace, people, it's just my own rather opinionated two penn'orth.The movie?  Long, claustrophobic, full of holes.

A Magical Secret Movie!,"I hated Harry Potter, but when I went to see the movie I just fell in love with it. I have read the book five times each, I have seen the movie about eight or nine times, and my room is literally filed with HP merchandise. This movie is such a compelling story full of mystery and excitement. The story starts as always, when Harry is with his aunt and uncle. He feels traped (which he later is by his uncle) because he has not recieved letters from his friends and is still treated badly by his own blood-family he has. When Dobby, a house elf, shows up in his room and warns him not to return to Howgarts, that a terror has been unleashed on mudbloods (muggle born). Harry ignores these warnings and returns to Howgarts, just to discover that a monster has been petrifing mudbloods throughout the year. When all the clues start adding up, it is up to Ron and Harry to capture the monster, bring Hagrid back, and get rid of all the rumors and evil that has been circling around his life. These is a story which all kids around the world will enjoy and cherish for decades to come. I gave this movie a 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A moderate improvement,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets moderately improves on its predecessor. The acting of the children is the clearest step forward. Radcliffe, Watson and Grint are much more natural this time around. Next, the special effects are better. There are superior practical effects (most notably, the serpent head) and no uncanny valley moments. Lastly, the writing flows more smoothly than in the previous film. Because there is less to introduce, Chamber of Secrets is evenly paced and emotional beats have more time to marinate. Furthermore, themes of racism are introduced. They might lack subtlety, but it's nice to have some subtext to digest.Chamber of Secrets makes technical advancements as well. The music is more integrated and a stronger dramatic guide. Meanwhile, the production design is elaborated with the titular Chamber feeling very large and lived in. This adds depth to the wizarding world that was somewhat absent in Sorcerer's Stone. However, despite these enhancements, Chamber of Secrets still feels a tad bogged down by its bloated runtime and its antiquated direction. Ultimately, Chamber of Secrets is a solid film but could use more filmmaking artistry to be truly exceptional.Writing: 7/10

Very nice addition to the series,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a somewhat restrained film, as Christopher Columbus makes the darker book seem much more childish than it is. Granted, the main characters are 12 years old, but it was way too light hearted.It's Harry Potter's second year at Hogwarts, and trouble seems to be brewing again. Harry is hearing voices in the walls, voices that he thinks are connected to strange happenings around the school. Meanwhile, the teachers are equally puzzled.The second Potter boasts stronger acting than before, as the lead actor Daniel Radcliffe grows in talent (and in size). He once again portrays Harry well, and continues this trend in the later sequels. Rupert Grint is the best of the trio with his knack for comedy. He offers some of the best lines in the film, but this is short lived because he gets some of the worst in movie 3 and 4. The adult actors are always in fine form. Richard Harris gives a warm and fatherly performance as Albus Dumbledore, something his successor, Michael Gambon, lacks. Alan Rickman is mysterious again even though his character was proved to be good in the first film. The standouts are Ken Branaugh and Christian Coulson as Gilderoy Lockhart and Tom Riddle respectively. Branaugh captures the essence of the character very well, making it one of the most accurate performances in any of the movies, and given his past, it's no surprise. Definitely the best part of the movie. Coulson also gives a great performance, but unfortunately telling you would be spoiling the ending (although half the world has either seen this or read the book or knows the truth about Tom Riddle). The other actors (Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Jason Isaacs, and Julie Walters) all give fine performances as well.The film is very restrained in its writing and directing. The script is the most accurate translation of the books, but there are moments where it gets slow. The climax, however, comes out of nowhere and moves along fast, which is one good thing that Steve Kloves does. The film is also an action/adventure breed, and it fits the bill this time around. The quidditch scenes are back and better than ever, although one scene contains the most obvious example of how fast the kids are growing (Tom Felton's voice changes drastically throughout the film). All in all, CoS is a fine movie for the average moviegoer, but the book lovers will find that it is a rather restrained and toned down version of the book. Due to some violence, especially the potentially scary climax (giant snake, anyone?), HPCoS might scare a viewer under age 10.8/10 --spy",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Parity,"I will spare you the boring tedium of me rehashing the cast and basic plotline of HP:CoS becaue far more able reviewers have done so already. What I shall say is this--HP:CoS is basically a darker, more forward version of the first installment. Which is a pretty good thing because I found this film to be fairly intricate and twisting (FYI, I have NEVER read the novels)--far moreso than Sorceror's Stone.A couple things that I would change would first to feature Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) in more scenes--I don't know why, but he adds so much to the table and creates an excellent foil for he other actors.I would also cut back on that 2002 version of Jar-Jar Binks, Dobby the House elf--not entirely, because its role is rather important but by a bit so that it remains a novelty of S&M rather than a drain on the senses. I'd say a decent ratiing of 8/10 would suffice.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
I give the film 2 thumbs up.,"If you thought the first movie was good than you will think this one is great. This is a great family movie. Both adults and children can follow this move with ease. This movie is not just another child's cartoon with unbelievable monsters like ""Monsters Inc.""; it is well-developed movie with great special effects. I personal have not read the book, but now after seeing this movie, it makes me want to read the whole series starting with the first one. My favorite character in this film was Dobby the mischief elf; he is mysteriously great in this film. It was apparent to me that Harry Potters (played by Daniel Radcliffe), Ron Weasley (played by Rupert Grint), and Hermione Granger (played by Emma Watson) has settled comfortably into their roles.The theme I have noticed in this film is that family is not only blood. It is apparent to me that Harry is happier with his Witchcraft family than his summer family. He feels more comfortable at the Hogwarts School.Dobby has come to the home of Harry's new summer home, to warn him of the great danger at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry discovers his ability to speak to snakes as him and his friends enter the second year of Hogwarts.

The Chamber of Secrets couldn't be much worse,"When I first read Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, I was blown away by it.  Even better than the first book, it showed all the signs of a classic children's novel.Therefore, I am quite amazed how someone can transform such an amazing story, into such a dreadful movie.First of all, lets deal with the acting.  While most adult characters were portrayed admirably, especially Gildroy Lockhard (Kenneth Branagh) and Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), every single kid in this movie was pathetic. Their performances showed the all the professionalism of a bad children's TV program.  Most of the conversation was stiff, and unemotional.Secondly, the plot.  Whilst I see the difficulty in transfering a book to the cinema, due to sheer length, they really have left out most of the parts which made the book good.  Characters come to conclusions so quickly that you could be left wondering what was going on.Lastly, the tragedy of hollywood on the film.  The book was filled with classic British homour, and to see the film be such cheesy nausiating hollywood pap, really annoys me.I'll leave it there because just writing about the film depresses me.2 out of 10",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
