"Excellent, depressing, but excellent","Man, I can not get this film out of my head. It is so rare that a movie can affect me the way ""The Pianst"" did. The last movie that did that was ""Casino"". I was really tired when I was watching the movie. It was almost midnight, so I was thinking that I'll start watching and I'll finish it in the morning. Did I? No, indeed I did not stop watching. I couldn't stop it. I just wanted to see what would happen next. I cried during ""Schindler's List"", I sobbed in this film. Everything that happens in this film is so sad. Adrien Brody does a remarkable job of acting in this film. I would very highly recommend this film. Especially if you are a history buff. Please, I think this film should be in the top 10 best films of all time.I looked on the message boards you know and some other user comments that didn't enjoy this film much, they criticized Adrien Brody's performance and say that he was boring and only showed emotions that are easy to act. Please, you have got to be kidding me. This man portrayed the total feeling of hopelessness, being alone, being hated. I one time had an audition in high school like this to see if I could improvise, and the way I imagined this feeling is like in dodgeball where you have no one else on your team and you're the only one left standing, yet on the other team there is 20 big men that are just waiting to wack that ball at you. Adrien couldn't have done a better job, I was so frightened for him and cried for him during the whole film while he was one the run.Roman Polanski as the director, he himself escaped the terrors of being a prisoner in The Holocaust, yet he lost his mother and other family members. Yes, I'm sure this film must have been hard to re create for him, but he was probably the only director that could have done this movie as brilliantly as he did. He created this story and made it so effective, I called up my mom and told her that I loved her so much because we take so many things for granted. True, this isn't the 1930's or 40's, and we are in America. But it's still frightening to think that human beings are capable of that much hate and being so brutal to another human.World War II is one of the most frightening wars in history, if you read more about The Holocaust, you get more into it and you should. If you are not interested, then watch this film. It's a must see, otherwise how else will we learn from our mistakes? The Pianist is a beautiful and extremely dark tale about a man and the struggle to survive. The ending is so powerful and moving to know that sometimes one man can make a difference in a crowd of so many and I'm not talking about Adrien Brody's character. You'll see what I mean.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
A Masterpiece. Awesome acting by Brody.,"This is a truly heart-wrenching story of one man whose family gets perished in the Holocaust and about his survival over solitude, deprivation, starvation and terror while in hiding during the Nazi occupation. In my opinion it is one of the finest depictions of the holocaust. This movie came close to Schindlers list in depicting the horrors of Holocaust. Brody puts in a marvelous and utterly touching performance. The story depicts the emotional and cultural breakdown of persecuted Jewish community as Nazi policy tightens around them. Excellent acting by Brody.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
10 out of 10,"The Pianist is an account of the true life experience of a Polish pianist during WW2, in the context of the deportation of the Jewish community to the Ghetto of Warsaw, a setting virtually absent from all films inspired on WW2.Polanski (himself a child survivor of the Krakow and Warsaw ghettos) could have described in more detail the legendary, desperate fighting of the Jewish resistance in the ghetto of Warsaw, or the horrific mass extermination in concentration camps. Instead, the film gains in intensity by displaying the war from the pianist's own point of view (through windows, half-opened doors, holes in the walls - with big emphasis on the use of ""point of view shooting"" by the cameraman). One cannot help feeling disturbed by the most enthralling scenes of the film, as the isolated pianist tries to ensure his survival in the ghetto and ruins of Warsaw, hiding and fleeing, moving from one bombed house to the next, gradually becoming a shadow of his former self, hungry and afraid (merit largely attributed to the extraordinary performance by Adrien Brody, who visibly loses half of his weight throughout the film).Does the pianist raise any sympathy from the audience? Not immediately, in my view. The pianist is more than often a drifting character, almost a witness of other people's and his own horrors. He seems to float and drift along the film like a lost feather, with people quickly appearing and disappearing from his life, some helping generously, others taking advantage of his quiet despair, always maintaining an almost blank, dispassionate demeanour. One may even wonder why we should care in the least about this character. But we do care. That is, I believe, the secret to this film's poetry.In one of the strongest scenes, towards the end, a German officer forces the pianist to play for his life, in an episode that suddenly brings a much lighter, beautifully poetic shade to the film (this German officer will be probably compared to Schindler, although his philanthropy does not quite share the same basis).This is also a wonderful tribute to Polish artists, through Chopin's music, with the concert at the very end of the film and the opening performance by the pianist at the local radio station (with the sound of bomb explosions in the background) forming an harmonious link between the beginning and end of the film (following Polanski's usual story-frame).Overall, The Pianist is one of the most detailed and shocking accounts of the treatment of the Jews by the Nazis, with the atmosphere in Warsaw well captured and believable. Quite possibly, The Pianist will remain in the history of film-making as the most touching and realistic portraits of the holocaust ever made.Polanski's film deserves a strong presence in the 2003 Oscar nominations, including a nomination for Adrien Brody's amazing performance, Polanski's sublime direction, best adapted screenplay and, obviously, best picture. This could be, at last, Polanski's long awaited, triumphal comeback to the high and mighty Hollywood.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
"A haunting film, one that you won't forget","I can remember when this film came out I was adamantly against seeing it. I had my preconceived notions that it would be some other heroic Jewish Holocaust film where good triumphs over evil and in between we would see some brutal atrocities committed by the Germans to add some flavour.How wrong I was.This is one of the best films I have ever seen and what it did to me I cannot describe in words. But in a nutshell, it moved me, made me cry, made me feel like I was in the Polish ghetto in 1940, and ultimately made me kiss the sidewalks as I walked out of the theater and thanked God that I live in the free society that I do.Roman Polanski has proved that he is a great director with films like Chinatown and Rosemary's Baby but this is his crowning achievement. I think the fact that this won the awards that it did at this years Oscars goes a long way to validate the brilliance of this film. I believe that the Oscar's are rigged for the most part and films and actresses and such win based more on their pedigree or business associations than anything else, so when it won best actor and director and adapted screenplay this year, it tells you that it should have won best picture but the Weinsteins seem to have a spell over everyone, hence a charlatan like Chicago takes top prize. Sorry for the digression here but when you compare a ""film"" like Chicago to a masterpiece like The Pianist, there really is one clear cut winner. They handed out the statue to the wrong movie.The Pianist follows up and coming piano player Wlad Spielzman from his days as a local hero to a prisoner of war to his time in the ghettos, surviving only by the kindness of strangers. I think many people have touched on this before but what makes this film so amazing and well crafted is because Spielzman is a man that we can all relate to. He is not a hero, he is not a rebel and he is not a kamikaze type that wants and lusts after revenge. He is a simple man that is doing everything in his power to stay alive. He is a desperate man and fears for his life and wants to stay as low as he can. Only from the succor he receives from others does he manage to live and breathe and eat and hide. And this is how I related to him. If put in his position, how would I react? Exactly the way he did. This is a man that had everything taken from him. His livelihood, his family, his freedom and almost his life. There is no time for heroics here. Adrien Brody embodies the spirit of Spielzman and his win at this years Oscars was one of the happiest moments I have had watching the festivities. His speech was even better but that is a topic for another time.Ultimately it is his gift of music that perhaps saves his life and the final scene that he has with the German soldier is one of the most emotionally galvanizing scenes I've witnessed. With very little dialogue, it is in the eyes, the face, the mouth and the sounds that chime throughout their tiny space that tell you all you need to know. I think it is this scene that won Brody his Oscar. This is one of the all time great performances.I think Polanski spoke from the heart here. He has taken a palette of memories and amalgamated them with what he has read and given us one of the best films of our generation and any other. I think The Pianist will go down as one of the best films of this century and when all is said and done, Chicago will be forgotten the way Ordinary People was forgotten and when people talk about the film The Pianist, they will do so with reverence and respect. This is a cinematic masterpiece.10 out of 10",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
An astonishing film,"The Pianist is the true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, at the time Poland's most acclaimed pianist whose life is transformed during the Nazi occupation of Warsaw beginning in 1939.  The film spans several years and maps his many personal trials in addition to providing the perspectives of his family, rebel factions and sympathizers.Brilliantly directed by Roman Polanski and starring an amazing Adrien Brody, The Pianist is bound to garner comparisons to Schindler's List, for obvious reasons.  However similar the subject matter, the approach is different. While Schindler's List was filmed in a beautiful, crisp black and white that offered many incredible images, The Pianist was filmed with almost muted color.  Schindler's List featured what has been argued as a complicated hero.  Oskar Schindler did save many Jews, but not without battling his own materialistic demons first.  The Pianist's Szpilman is a sympathetic character throughout.  His plight was desperate, and the demons he fought were over his own guilt in surviving a fight that eventually turns into a primal will to live.Polanski does not spare the viewer any grief with his film.  The horrific scenes between the Nazis and the Warsaw Jews were more terrifying and horrible than any horror/suspense movie I have seen in some time, possibly ever.  The humiliation and complete loss is wrenching.  In several scenes, Jews are lined up in the middle of the night and subjected to either torture or death.  In one case, a woman asks of a Nazi officer, ""What will happen to us?"" and is promptly shot point blank in the head.  The camera does not flinch or subdue any of these atrocities.A mention must be made of Brody's performance.  Having only previously seen Brody in two other films, Spike Lee's ""Summer of Sam"" and Terrence Malick's ""The Thin Red Line"" (a part that was supposed to be his launch into stardom before his part was unfortunately cut drastically) I knew his potential was great.  After his Oscar win, I viewed this movie with more criticism than I normally would have and he certainly did not disappoint.  He transcended my expectations.  His physical transformation was amazing, but more importantly, he conveyed the sorrow of this man shockingly well - in both verbal and non-verbal contexts.  It will be very interesting to see what kind of opportunities this role will afford him, and the kinds of roles he will accept.Something worth mentioning is the affect this movie had on the audience with whom I viewed this film.  Normally, when a film ends, the regular hardcore filmsters like myself will stay and watch the credits in their entirety. The rest of the audience stands up and leaves, usually to the chagrin of the remaining enthusiasts.  This was one of the few times I have seen a film at a theater where not one person stood to leave during the final credits. It wasn't until the house lights came up at the end did people begin to disperse.  Personally, I hightailed it out of the theater the second the lights came on because not only was my face a mess from crying during the film (Tammy Faye comes to mind) but I had this overwhelming need for an emotional release, so when I reached my car I sat and wept for about five minutes.  It has been years since I have watched a film that upset me to that extent. Conversely, while discussing this film with my brother, (someone who loves movies as much and has similar tastes as I do) he mentioned that while he thought the movie was excellent, he wasn't as profoundly emotionally effected as I was.  After thinking about this for a couple of days, I realized the difference: The music.  As a classical music enthusiast and erstwhile musician, the thought of not being able to enjoy, much less play the music you love is a tragic one.  Then the emotional outpouring that comes when you return to it - there aren't words to describe how intense that is.  Not having the same appreciation for this musical genre, one will be able to sympathize with the physical and emotional tribulations, but perhaps not in the musical sense.The Pianist was truly an astonishing film.  I was riveted from start to finish and so emotionally affected that I couldn't even consider writing a review until a week later.  Having said that, I am filing this away with my list of movies which include Schindlers List and Philadelphia, as films that I love but cannot rewatch for a long time after due to their intensely emotional content.--Shelly",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Adrien Brody's Minimalist Acting Packs Maximum Emotional Punch,"This wrenching yet ultimately uplifting fact-based drama won Adrien Brody his Academy Award and finally made him a star (along with his gracious yet heartfelt Oscar speech and That Kiss :-) -- rightly so, since title character Wladyslaw Szpilman is a challenging role in so many ways!  It's not easy to command the screen when your character often has to be passive, deliberately trying not to draw attention to himself to keep from falling into Nazi hands in war-torn Poland, but Brody pulls it off.  It helps that Brody is absolutely stellar at acting with his eyes, plus his body language speaks volumes; these fill in the emotional cracks, especially in scenes where Szpilman, alone and in hiding, can't speak or even move around much for fear of giving himself away.  (Brody is the youngest actor to date to win the Best Actor Oscar, BTW, having gotten his little gold man only a month before his 30th birthday.) While there's no lack of haunting scenes, thanks to the deservedly Oscar-winning work of director Roman Polanski and screenwriter Ronald Harwood, the one that always gets me is the one where Szpilman discovers the apartment serving as his latest `safe house' has a piano. We see Szpilman sit at the piano; we see him in a head-and-shoulders shot, shoulders moving; we hear piano music and gasp as we fear his love and longing for music is about to give him away -- and then we see his hands moving in the air just above the keyboard and realize, with both relief and a pang of regret, that the music is only in Szpilman's head.  Terrific as the other 2002 Best Actor nominees were, now that I've seen THE PIANIST (as well as the fascinating making-of documentary on the DVD's flip side, showing what a physically and emotionally grueling experience Brody's job often was), I'd be really p***ed off if anybody but Adrien Brody had won! (Besides, the rest of the 2002 Best Actor nominees already won Oscars -- this time it was dark horse Brody's turn! :-)",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
To hell and back.,"The Pianist is an incredible film in many aspects. Roman Polanski's account of the survival of the pianist, Wladyslaw Szpilman, is a document about how one man can overcome the worst possible situations in a world gone completely mad around him.The only fault one can find with the adaptation of Mr. Szpilman's story by playwright Ronald Harwood, is the fact that we never get to know the real Wladyslaw Szpilman, the man, as some of the comments made to this forum also have indicated.There is a very interesting point raised by the the pianist's father who upon reading something in the paper, comments about how the Americans have forgotten them. Well, not only the Americans, but the rest of the world would not raise a finger to do anything for the people that were being imprisoned and made to live in the confined area of Warsaw. The exterminating camps will come later.What is amazing in the film, is the frankness in which director Polanski portrays the duplicity of some Jews in the ghetto. The fact that Jews were used to control other Jews is mind boggling, but it was a fact, and it's treated here matter of factly. Had this been made by an American director, this aspect would have never surfaced at all. Yet, Mr. Polanski and Mr. Harewood show us that all was not as noble and dignified as some other films have treated this ugly side of war.Wladyslaw Szpilman, as played by Adrien Brody, is puzzling sometimes, in that we never get to know what's in his mind. He's a man intent in not dying, but he's not a fighter. He accepts the kindness extended to him. He never offers to do anything other than keep on hiding, which is a human instinct. He will never fight side by side with the real heroes of the ghetto uprising. His role is simply to witness the battle from his vantage point in one of the safe houses across the street from where the action takes place.Adrien Brody is an interesting actor to watch. As the pianist of the story he exudes intelligence. There is a scene where Szpilman, in one of the safe houses he is taken, discovers an upright piano. One can see the music in his head and he can't contain himself in moving his fingers outside the closed instrument playing the glorious music from which he can only imagine what it will sound in his mind.The supporting cast is excellent. Frank Findlay, a magnificent English actor is the father of the pianist and Maureen Lipman, another veteran of the stage, plays the mother with refined dignity.In watching this film one can only shudder at the thought of another conflict that is currently brewing in front of our eyes. We wonder if the leaders of the different factions could be made to sit through a showing of The Pianist to make them realize that war is hell.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
"Brilliantly Narrated, Visually Stunning!","Polanski has depicted the gory details of the holocaust without much restraint. But, the most wonderful aspect of the film is that the director has not lost focus of his story and instead of focusing too much on the holocaust horror he has weaved the true-life narrative of survival around devillish happenings.Every single act of escapade Szpilman goes through is depicted like a drop of water on a barren desert. However, the Oasis in the driest desert comes in the end and it is here that Polanski captures the essence of human emotion. I had this very strong urge of jumping into the theater screen and magically adopting a character in the movie and doing something about the helplesness portrayed so convincingly.Overall, Polanski has given a stunning visual narrative of the cold war. Survival indeed is a privilege though it is taken for granted today. Performances by Brody, Kretschmann deserve applause.Pawel Edelman's camera work is moving and he has brilliantly captured the dark sadness in the visual canvas in an effective way. The lighting is amazing. Pre-dawn shooting schedule could have helped a great deal.Hervé de Luze's editing work has ensured that the narrative does not slip away from focus. Most notable is the scene where the human bodies are lit on fire and the camera raises to show the smoke. The darkness of the smoke is enhanced and is used effectively to fade the scene out.The scene where Brody's fingers move as he rests his hands on the bars of the tram handle only goes to show the brilliance of Polanski as a film-maker.Great film that will be in the running for this year's Oscars. I will give it a 9 Out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
"Stoic, haunting tale of survival","The Pianist tells the story of such a man in war time Poland, played by Adrien Brody, who from start to finish sees his life literally getting worse and worse and worse- starts off with new rules from the Nazis, then the stars on the arms, followed by the Warsaw ghetto, and while there he could play in the restaurant, that too soon ended, as the trains arrived and took his family and anyone else he knew away.  During this he narrowly escapes, and from then on the film in a sense almost becomes not exactly a holocaust film, but more like a cross of that as the element and the basic structure of something a-la in Cast Away: this includes stretches of scenes showing Brody simply trying to keep out of view of the Germans, either in a small apartment provided by helpful Polish Christians/Jewish resistance, or as a scavenger in the abandoned sections of the ghetto, all while feeling the old rhythm of the piano in his head and fingertips.This is the kind of magnificent filmmaking that shows a director not only being as true to the story given to him (that of Painist Szpilman, based on his autobiography) but to his past as well- Roman Polanksi faced similar conditions as a boy in the early 40's, and has found the best line to show, never crossed or mis-stepped, in representing the characters and the period. There aren't any hints of tightened suspense, no clues as to where the film could veer to, it just is.  The big difference to be seen between a film like this and Schindler's List is not just in the people and situations (Schindler's List was a film about two people, Schindler and Goeth, in the foreground while the Pianist is a total first person tale), yet also in the filmmaking qualities being here surely European.  And while the accents on the Polish-Jewish actors sounds a bit too British, that is quite forgivable considering the scope of the project (thank heavens he didn't put in English speaking Germans).In conclusion, Brody turns in a superb performance, and this indeed is in with Polanski's best, a deserved of 2002's Palme D'Or.  Great music too. A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
"terrific movie, if relentlessly gritty and realistic","I remember seeing ""Schindler's list"" about ten years ago, and I remember how weird I felt for being almost completely unmoved by it. Although it showed the horrors of holocaust quite realistically, somehow it all seemed just a bit too fake and exaggerated. Characters were a bit off (I still can't decide who was more over the top, Schindler or Goeth), fake sentimentalism was all over the place, . While it was a work of art and an important reminder of true events that shouldn't be forgotten, on emotional level it just somehow failed to deliver.Enter ""The Pianist"". With no Spielberg around to put his trademark sappy material, we finally have a movie that shows the true horror and tragedy of Jewish people in World War II. The story is told through the eyes of one man - Wladislaw Szpielman, Jewish pianist who works in a radio station in Warsaw during the German occupation of Poland. Together with him we watch his world getting torn apart, witness his family being taken away, his existence being reduced to bare essentials. Brody gives a subtle yet spectacular performance, his best work yet. And never once are we reminded that we are watching a movie. Everything is shown from Szpielman's point of view, and it is all very gritty and realistic. While Spielberg's rendition of German atrocities always had a slightly staged feel to augment their dramatic purpose, here they are so true to life there impact is much greater - you watch and are being reminded in horror that this things actually happened.While being very hard to watch sometimes, this is a movie that ""Schindler's List"" was supposed to be. This movie doesn't judge anybody, or tries to explain anything - it shows historical events as a reflection of one man's fate, making a powerful testimony that stays with you long after the beautiful last shot and the end credits are over.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
the best holocaust movie ever made,"last weekend, I saw Roman Polanski's The Pianist and what a movie. The grizzly reality feeling of the movie shell-shocked me in the first place but later on I recognized the pure feeling of the film: The horror what war does with innocent people truly is. the main story isn't about a war hero, but about people who don't want to die in this madness. Every aspect of the film is really done for an reason and in his place and you don't feel this as entertainment.the music is what hit me the most. the classical tunes had such an enormous impact on me and portrayed the feelings of the main role of the pianist. The fact that there are no hero's in a war movie is for me more than a welcome benefit. No war in the world should have hero's who can't die. Everybody in this movie can die, every second of it. The scary moments are real scary.bottom line: ten times as realistic as the also brilliant Schindler's list. and twenty times better than Saving private Ryan for the lack of hero's and there is no patriotism at all.ten out of ten, best movie of 2002",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
6.3/10 - Wanted to Like This More,"The Pianist must be one of the most acclaimed and well-known depictions of the Holocaust in cinema, ever. Directed by Roman Polanski, it follows the true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman - a Jewish pianist in Warsaw, Poland, just as the Nazi occupation begins there. It depicts the worsening state of him and his family through the Holocaust, and his struggle to survive throughout it.I can appreciate the sentiment of the film, showing how even well-known artists and people with status were stripped by the Nazi regime of their human rights, how things slowly escalated until even the artists couldn't think of art outside of dreams, maybe. How it all came down to surviving, and even the luckiest people that somehow managed to survived were deeply scarred by the horrible things they've seen. I'd say that Brody gives a very solid performance, and the film does manage to accomplish what it tries to do, in a way. The problem is, well, that it doesn't do much beyond that.There were scenes with shock value, sure, and thinking that everything we saw in the film is pretty close to how things went down can make one shiver all right. But the plot, especially in the second half of the film, didn't have much meat at all. The film crawled its way forward, the saturation goes down with each scene, but never did anything special to compensate for the slow, slow pacing and lack of interest I had in the main plot. The cinematography is okay, the dialogue is okay, the performances are okay. The moments that moved me were mostly that - moments - and mostly on the first half of the film. For a 2.5-hour film, it could've done more. Especially considering how widely acclaimed it is.So, if I had to sum it up, I'd say that I do appreciate certain things in the movie - the way it depicts the fall, the terror and the utter shock that Jewish artists have felt as they were torn apart from their seemingly-safe world, for instance. The shock value is definitely there in certain scenes, but the overall experience was pretty slow and lacking. I wasn't immersed, and I think that the film ends up feeling just...well, not bad, but not really good either. The first half is pretty good; the second half is mostly meh. I'm feeling something like a 6.3/10. Really wanted to like this more, but I guess it wasn't meant to be.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
"Move along, no story here","If you think that movies that deal with Nazi atrocities are inherently worthwhile, then you might think that this movie is inherently worthwhile. If, on the other hand, you expect a movie, whether it deals with Nazi atrocities or not, to actually tell a story, then I'd say there's a good chance you *won't* find this movie worthwhile.What does this movie give us? Well, it gives us a string of Nazi atrocities, very realistically depicted, and it gives us what I suppose is supposed to be a main character, but it gives us precious little else!  Most of main character's screen time is given over to him being acted upon by circumstances and by other people, but very little of him being pro-active, himself.  And even his passivity might be interesting if we knew what he was thinking or feeling.  But we are never given that information.  We never know what it is that he really wants.  Or how he feels, say, about the fact that his family was shipped off to their probable death, but he was saved by a fluke.The picture is certainly well-made from the stand point of art direction and cinematography, but story-wise, it's a shambles.  As far as I'm concerned, Roman Polanski owes me big-time.  Thank you.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Unforgettable,"My husband and I decided to watch this on netflix one night as we had heard it was good. Neither of us had any expectations and figured if it won a couple of Oscars it must be decent. I had no idea it was an absolute masterpiece.This may be one of the best movies I have seen to date. Days after I saw this movie I cannot stop visualizing the images and feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. The cinematography is breathtaking. The beauty of pre-devastation Warsaw is sharply contrasted with the bleakness of the ghetto, and it would be understatement to say how haunting the visuals of Warsaw after the bombings were.The acting here is tremendous. Brody (who I had really not seen in anything else significant prior to this) carries the entire movie on his wan shoulders. He conveys so much with pain, anguish, hope, and loss with just his eyes. It is quite the actor who causes the viewer to feel the pain he is experiencing as a character. This was an extremely well deserved acting Oscar.This movie is extremely depressing considering the subject matter but it is told and portrayed with grace and power by Polanski. So many scenes are powerful and haunting. To me, in many ways this is a perfect movie.

Harrowing Performance by Adrian Brody,"Some reviews I've read here, have found this movie too detached, lacking urgency. I believe, that impassive quality reflects exactly what Polanski wants to say this extraordinary jewel.By showing Wladyslaw Szpilman as a survivor but not a fighter or a hero--as a man who does all he can to save himself, but would have died without enormous good luck and some kindness from a few non-Jews--Polanski is reflecting, I believe, his own deepest feelings: that he survived, but need not have, and that his mother died and left a wound that had never properly healed.Adrian Brody's performance was utterly mesmerising. I doubt that we'll see him act like that - EVER.Little wonder he was awarded Best Male Actor at the Oscars.Polanski too was awarded Best Director - ironic Brody was the youngest recipient of an Oscar and Polanski was the oldest until Clint Eastwood won it several years later.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
I'm physically upset,"I knew Roman Polanski's talent but was not prepared to this descent to Hell, described in painstaking detail. I'm physically upset after watching this film. The sense of disgust is real. How awful. How awful.I could not help identifying myself with the Jewish Poles in Varsovia. I couldn't help thinking that the paralytic old man thrown down the window could be my grandfather. Couldn't help thinking that the kid savagely pulled through the wall could be my brother. Couldn't help thinking that the girl asking the SS-guard the wrong question and being killed just for that, could be myself.The film describes beastly destruction of any dignity, and yet the struggle for surviving despite everything, even if rationally you realise that, perhaps, it would be even better to end it all at once. It describes the dishonesty of people profiting of this situation to make business out of your misery. It describes your need of believing the words of men NOT of their word, if they promise you life. And affection and courage surviving despite all this.This film could make a good pair with ""der Untergang"" with Bruno Ganz, which is also such a masterpiece that you may risk feeling sympathetic with the Nazi.

Tour de Force,"There have been so many fine films that deal with the Holocaust. Each shows the atrocities of the Germans, their random cruelty, their ruthlessness. This film has all that, but it also has Adrien Brody. This is a film that gets us inside the human being, the person who must run, whose iron will propels him forward. The thing is, though, he is not necessarily a hero in the traditional sense. We sense the fatigue of his character as he runs from situation to situation, just trying to stay alive. There are good people around him, many are good Germans. While we watch people shot in the head, beaten to the ground, mutilated, we see him moving aimlessly toward something (the thing is we don't know what that something is). He hears rumors about the Russians liberating Poland but he can't let up for a second. He watches as the underground makes sacrifice after sacrifice, their building burned, their people sent up in flames. He sees himself as a coward. He thinks about being dead, but his will to live drives him on. The title, of course, is him--the pianist--a nationally known classical pianist, suddenly dehumanized. We see his weaknesses and his strengths. We also get a more balanced though terrifying view of the situation in the Polish ghetto.

Lacks a bit of character development and not as powerful as I expected it to be,"This is a well crafted movie that deserves some praise, but I still felt the film is a bit overrated. I guess it's cause I was expecting a phenomenal and amazing movie, but what I got was a pretty good movie. It just wasn't as powerful or compelling as I thought it would be. Adrien Brody was almost perfect for this role, his transition from being a prideful musician to a broken down man was done really well. This film just wasn't all that challenging, the plot is basically based on a true story of Władysław Szpilman(Adrien Brody). And his struggle to survive during the Holocaust. The thing is the whole thing seems a bit conventional a lot of aspect of this movie just seemed to narrow at times and straightforward which isn't necessarily a good thing and lack depth. The film also seemed to drag a bit because of the direction it kept going, it's a good movie and I agree with some of the positive feedback this film has been getting. It just isn't a powerful or amazing film I was looking forward to seeing, not one of those movies I feel I need to see again someday after it's finished. It really isn't a masterpiece like come critics claim it to be.7.8/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
gripping though flawed drama,"`The Pianist' is a bit like `Schindler's List' as seen from the inside out.  The one flaw in that earlier film always seemed to be that, by choosing to make a Gentile  Oskar Schindler - the protagonist in his film, Spielberg turned the Jews themselves almost into background players in their own story.  That doesn't happen with `The Pianist' since the hero in this case happens to be himself a Jew  the real life Polish pianist and composer Wladyslaw Szpilman - who managed, through strength, determination and the assistance of a number of brave and caring individuals, to survive the horrors of that darkest and most inexplicable chapter in 20th Century history.This is not to say that `The Pianist' is a better film than `Schindler's List'  far from it.  For while this latest work from Roman Polanski is a fascinating tale of survival in its own right, the film lacks the moral and psychological resonance that made Spielberg's work such a universally acclaimed masterpiece.  Because Schindler was an outsider looking in, he was forced to make the kind of moral choices that Szpilman never really faces in the situations in which he finds himself.  In fact, the one time that the protagonist is confronted with such an option  having to decide whether or not to betray his people by joining the Jewish police whose job it is maintain order in the Warsaw ghetto  Szpilman flat out declines the offer. This may, indeed, be the way circumstances played themselves out in real life, but this elimination of any kind of psychological depth makes `The Pianist' seem frustratingly superficial at times.Although the film isn't as rich and powerful as it might have been, `The Pianist' is still exceptional on a lot of different levels.  First of all, Polanski and his screenwriter, Ronald Hardwood, both of whom won Oscars for their work here, capture the brutality and sadism of the Nazi regime with frightening candor and almost `reportorial' objectivity.  As in `Schindler's List,' people in this film die in very believable, very graphic ways. Particularly interesting are the early sections of the film in which we witness the gradual steps leading up to the eventual deportation and extermination of the Warsaw Jews, beginning with the curtailment of Jewish civil rights, then to the branding of them with stars of David on their clothing, then to their imprisonment in the Warsaw ghetto, and, finally, to the inexorable walk to the gas chamber.  `The Pianist' doesn't take us that far on screen, but we sure sense the presence of those death camps in the loss of Szpilman's entire family.  `The Pianist' brilliantly recreates this shameful era in recent human history and does so without becoming sentimental and pretentious in the process.Adrian Brody won the Best Actor Oscar for his performance here, and he is very good indeed, especially given the fact that the role calls for him to be more of a reactor to the events around him than a catalyst.  Polanski and Hardwood have provided this fine young actor with a veritable tour de force assignment that he executes with a great deal of skill and aplomb. Unfortunately, a number of the other characters - particularly those who go out of their way to help him - remain stubbornly enigmatic throughout.`The Pianist' is an honorable addition to the list of fine films that have attempted to come to grips with the subject of the holocaust.  But, for my money, the best still remains `The Shop on Main Street,' the Oscar-winning Best Foreign Language film of 1965.  This superb Czech film does what `The Pianist' is never quite able to do, which is to find a way to involve us in the momentous moral dilemmas that undoubtedly faced many of the people involved in this life-and-death event.  `The Pianist,' by making its tale strictly a story of survival and not a study of human psychology, fails to illuminate much of what we really need to know about that time. And about ourselves.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

Intense biography about a Polish pianist named Szpilman during the Nazi invasion on Warsaw.,"This is an emotional tale and very decent drama about a pianist named Szpilman from a luxurious life until terrible ending in the Warsaw ghetto and other events. Polanski directs perfectly a brooding portrait about the holocaust with his personal knowledge and own experience on his tumultuous childhood . Adrien Brody is excellent in a complicate and suffering role. Besides, other splendid actors, such as Frank Finlay, Jessica Meyer, Emilia Fox and Thomas Kretschman as a good Nazi officer who helps him. It contains evocative and adequate cinematography by cameraman Pawel Edlman, Polanski's regular. Musical score by Wojciech Kilar with brilliant piano sounds. Academy Award for best director Roman Polanski, Actor: Adrien Brody and adapted script by Ronald Harwood based on Wladyslaw Szpilman memories.Adding more details over largely described on the movie referred 'the Warsaw ghetto uprising', the events happened on the following way: In 1939, after the invasion of Poland, Reinhard Heydrich chief of Gestapo began to place all Polish Jews in ghettos, where they could slowly die of hunger and disease. The campaign was to be administered by the Waffen-SS the party's military formations that fought as integral units in the armed forces. The Warsaw ghetto was the largest of these segregated areas established by the Nazis in Poland. In 1940 Heydrich, using the excuse that the spread of typhus had to be contained, set up a special section 11 miles in circumference enclosed by a brick wall 10 feet high. The cost was paid by the Judenrat, the Jewish Council of twenty-four-members, which was in charge of Jewish affairs inside the ghetto. In 1940 more than 80.000 gentile Poles living in the infected area were ordered to leave, and the next month about 140,000 living elsewhere in the city were moved in which the 240,000 still live in the ghetto. Some 360.000 Jews, a third of Warsaw's population, were herded into a 3,5-square-mile area. Meanwhile, Gestapo agents removed all Jews from the economic and cultural life of the city, from factories,shops, theaters, and libraries. On November 15,1940, the ghetto was sealed and its twenty-two entrances closed. No one was allowed to leave or enter, there was to be contact with the outside world. The situation soon became critical,Jews fought for jobs in the ghetto, including work with the labor battalions organized by the Nazis. Those unable to find work tried to exist by selling jewels,clothing, or anything else to obtain food. From 300 to 400 died daily in the Warsaw trap. More than 43.000 starved to death during the first year. Children crazed by hunger crawled through the sewers to the non-Jewish sectors of the city to smuggle in a bit of food. People were no longer moved by the sight of men and women falling dead on the streets. The Nazi authorities began intensified measure on July 22, 1942. As a memorial to Heydrich, Heirich Himmler ordered all Jews except those already in concentration camps to be deported .The ghetto and all labor camps would then be destroyed. Mass deportations to the gas chambers of Treblinka began. In two months 300.000 Jews were eliminated. The Judenrat was ordered to deliver 6.000 Jews daily for deportation. Each day thousands were driven by guards through the gates. Young Zionists, pioneers training to go to Palestine, mobilized first to be followed by members of the Polish workers party . On July 28, 1942, the Jewish Combat organization consisting about 1.000 men and boys was formed. All resolved to kill as many of their tormentors as they could before they died. The Jews fighting from rooftops, cellars, and attics,Poles outside the ghetto now began to send in more revolvers, grenades, and dynamite. In 1943 the guerrillas divided into twenty-two groups built an intricate network underground cellars and tunnels ,linked with command posts . In April 19,1943 German troops moved in on the ghetto to send all who were left to Treblinka in a final action. First came the armed trucks, tanks, and armored cars. The ghetto fighters poured a hail of bullets, grenades and bombs, the fighting went on for twenty-eight days. The guerrillas fought to the last. Many committed suicide at the moment before capture. The Germans dragged survivors from the cellars and rubble. Fewer than 100 escaped, the last 60000 Jews had been exterminated or killed in the explosions and fires. Polish sources reported that the fighters had killed 300 Germans and wounded 1000. From Warsaw Jewish resistance moved to swamps and forests.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
"Good, but imdb voters are overrating it","The Pianist is far from Roman Polanski's best film or his `most personal work,' as the back of the DVD case says. In fact, it's easily the least personal film I've seen from him; any director who has enough clout to secure the funding for the production could have made this film and had it turn out just as well. As a director, it is a small achievement. Likewise, the screenplay writes itself; in fact, it did write itself, as it's based on a true story. I must admit I have a bias against films dealing with WWII and especially the Jewish experience in Europe. Affecting the audience is as simple as snapping one's fingers. Or, more specifically, executing a Jew. Whenever the audience starts to get a little comfortable, all the filmmaker has to do is have a Nazi shoot a Jew in the head. It's all too easy. Any film with that subject matter is automatically deemed important in the minds of critics and audiences, which makes it difficult for anyone to propose any criticism against it. Truth be told, The Pianist is a very good film. It's well done, and, while I don't think it's Polanski's best work, he does a good job. But it's too easy, I think, to overpraise something like this. It was very entertaining that this movie caused so many upsets at the Oscars, but, after seeing the film, it doesn't surprise me. This is the kind of movie that impresses the Academy most, because it's easy. The three awards it won were not deserved, at least in my opinion. If I weren't so familiar with the Academy and their thought processes, it would really shock me that Polanski beat Scorsese, who made an original picture with verve and passion, and that Brody (I haven't mentioned him, and he is good) beat Daniel Day-Lewis, who, as I've just said above, creates a character that will live forever. As for the screenplay, Ronald Harwood (and/or Polanski) could have made the film much more than just one of ten thousand tales of survival. There are a lot of moments when more substance could have been found. I like how Szpilman has to constantly watch the action while locked up in a room, yearning to be able to do something about it, but always relegated to the spectator's role. They do do well when they introduce the character of the Nazi soldier trying to make good by helping Szpilman, but they don't do very much. Of course, I think part of the point is that this man appeared and disappeared without much pomp or circumstance. In fact, it would have been more powerful if they had never revealed that Szpilman discovered who this man was. Of course, that might have been disrespectful.I have now seen all five Best Picture nominees from last year, and I would rank them as follows: 1) The Hours; 2) Gangs of New York; 3) The Pianist; 4) Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers; 5) Chicago. That I rank the actual winner last shouldn't raise eyebrows, because, to tell you the truth, I don't rank The Pianist and The Two Towers that much higher. The first two were original, intelligent, and challenging. The last three were much simpler, and it's no big surprise that they are more beloved. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Spilzman? What a beautiful name for a pianist...,"In March 2003, Roman Polanski's ""the Pianist"" (2002) pocketed three Oscars including best actor (Adrien Brody) and best director (Roman Polanski). One month earlier, the ceremony of the French Oscars showered the movie with praise by attributing to it and his author similar prizes. Earlier in May 2002, the festival of Cannes crowned it of the most prestigious prize: the deservedly Golden Palm. Already in 2002 and chiefly throughout 2003, awards rained on Polanski's deeply moving piece of work and rightly so. It is a true return to form for him after an uneven career which started after the spooky ""the Tenant"" (1976) and wildly oscillated between duds (Pirates, 1986, Frantic, 1988) and palatable but not peerless works (Death and the Maiden, 1994, the Ninth Gate, 1999). ""The Pianist"" helped to rekindle the flame that made such treasures, hallmarks in their own domains (the wonderful ""Rosemary's Baby"", 1968 in the fantastic or the fabulous ""Chinatown"", 1974 in the film noir) and could be a stalwart success in the movie with the Second World War as the backdrop. It is perhaps Polanski's most personal film to date and the one he has always wanted to shot, surely to exorcise traumatic memories haunting him since his childhood. Like his main protagonist, Wladyslaw Szpilman, he experienced the horror of the ghetto of Warsaw.To get his demons out of his head, he preferred to adapt for the screen Spilzman's memories, a genius pianist and a man who bit by bit lost his family and friends on whom he could rely, a man who was deprived of his piano and thus of his ""raison d'être"". As Stefan Zweig says: ""to read is to live"", well for him ""to play is to live"". Even when he has the opportunity to play, he has to refrain himself. See the scene in which he has settled down to his flat. Before leaving him, the owner says to him: ""please, don't make noise"". Polanski makes us share his craving for playing by putting his main protagonist in front of the sacred instrument ans plays us the music in Spilzman's head without the latter touches the keys. He was also a man who saw sorrow, pain and the unthinkable (the sequences in which German officers and soldiers kill Jewish people give goose pimples because they're precisely unthinkable). Throughout his sufferings, chance didn't totally relinquish him: he was rescued at the last minute by a Polish policeman (and a fellow of his brother) who stopped him from going up in the train of death to Auschwitz. At this moment, he was saved from death but he lost his family. Then, he had to rely on his courage to survive and enjoyed the help of some fellows even if they absconded (the woman Spilzman made the acquaintance at the beginning of the film and her husband who found him a flat). At last, the German officer at the end of the film, was his ultimate glimmer of hope.Roman Polanski shot his film with a classic but startling directing for the sake of detail and realism. It has a linear but inevitable progression which has the look of a downward spiral: the tightening of the restrictions on Jewish people which become increasingly harsher (the armband to distinguish the Jewish from other peoples, then the delimitation and the encircling of the ghetto, the Jews chased away from their neighborhood and deported to the extermination camps) and the least sign of certainty is nearly automatically blighted: ""we have work certificates at last"" sighs Spilzman's father. Alas! Hopes blighted since just as he pronounces these words, a German officer asks them with other people to go outside. Some of them are killed while the others (including Spilzman's family) have to wait on a large square with thousands of others. Polanski also relates notable events with a minimum of means (the fight and shooting sequences are often perceived from a balcony or a window).The second part of the film strongly recalls Polanski's murkiest hours extracted from his masterworks. For example, in his flat, Spilzman tries to be as quiet as possible and while searching for food in his kitchen and drops crockery. The noise makes his neighbor intervene and by giving the alarm in the building obliges him to flee once again. At this moment, we find one of Polanski's trademarks: the eerie neighbor who has a harmful influence on the hero and contributes to his or her fall (the Castevet in ""Rosemary's Baby"", the offbeat inhabitants of the building in ""the Tenant"". In another extent, when Spilzman has to lurk in the destroyed ghetto (the distant shot where we can see him trudging in the ruins of this apocalyptic landscape deserves to rank among Polanski's most notable shots in all his filmography), Polanski really places us amid a ""in camera"" in spite of the sprawling scenery.The filmmaker should also be thanked for having chosen Adrien Brody in the main role. He works wonders in a part which seemed to be tailor-made for him, a far cry from his cardboard character in M Night Shyamalan's ""the Village"" (2004). He can act several persona in himself: a smart young man as well as a dirty and bearded tramp. His angular face, his acute and melancholic countenance stay with us for a long time. As for the German officers, they are often caricatured but ultimately Polanski eschews the trap of Manicheism which seemed to pervade the whole film thanks to the last sequences with the sympathetic German officer. Not all Nazis were beasts...Interspersed with either unbearable, either excruciating or either moving sequences and with striking shots, ""the Pianist"" has its place on the podium of Polanski's towering achievements. See it any costs! Unfortunately it would seem that the flame began to flicker again given the lukewarm critics ""Oliver Twist"" met this year. The slump again? Only time will tell...",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
It's a captivating film.,"Polish musician Wladyslaw Szpillman tries to cope with life in Naxi occupied Warsaw.I only recently watched Schindler's list, and was so moved, IMDb recommended The Pianist, and I was not disappointed, this was an incredibly powerful, moving, but upsetting movie.It charts the sequence of events, first the Polish Jews are moved from their homes, robbed, and placed into ghettos, made to wear a star of David, then finally moved into Concentration Camps.It just amazes me to think how and why these atrocities actually happened, still in living memory for some, surely one of the most shocking times in human history. You see the violence ramp up as the film progresses.It's an incredibly well made film, it looks terrific, people look very much of that time, surely a consideration the casting director used.Several things that always stayed with me, someone begging with a corpse laying on the ground that was one moment, another being the elderly man in the wheelchair, harrowing sequences.I thought Adrien Brody was excellent as Szpillman, a very understated performance, totally sincere, incredibly believable.

Polanski's New Spin on an Old Classic,"Before seeing ""The Pianist,"" I thought there couldn't possibly be a movie about the Holocaust that could tell me something I didn't already know, or make me feel an emotion I haven't already felt a hundred times before about the topic. But director Roman Polanski proved me wrong.There's a scene in ""The Pianist"" in which Nazis invade a Jewish apartment building and ""clean out"" its tenants. They pick up an elderly man confined to a wheelchair, carry the chair to the edge of the balcony, and casually tip him over the edge to fall to his death on the pavement below. The moment shocked me in a way that nothing in Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" did, I think precisely because, unlike Spielberg, Polanski isn't interested in manipulating his audience into feeling something. The strength of his movies has always been that they unfold with a detached, objective point of view and let audiences draw their own conclusions. The scene described above is so shocking because Polanski does nothing to embellish it and therefore never draws attention to the fact that you're watching a movie.The rest of the film is like that -- it's harrowing and unpleasant at times, but it also rewards the viewer by saying something about a historical event when I didn't think there was anything left to say.Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Warsaw Fact...,"Around 30% of Warsaw's population was Jewish in 1939, about 375,000 people; with refugees, the population of the ghetto rose to 450,000 - over 80,000 perished in it; deportations to Treblinka began in July 1942 (Yad Vashem).I would rather have seen this film in the languages of those it portrays using actors from the countries and regions where these despicable, heinous and unforgivable events took place.

Over-rated story of survival,"I don't know what to say about this move other than it really didn't movie me. Sure Adrian Brody is excellent as the Pianist of the title who hides out in Warsaw as the city is destroyed around him, but I never really connected to the story. I never really cared. I'm not sure if its poor film making or simply the fact that for me this seemed as been there and done that. Many of the things that I dislike in the well financed movies concerning the Holocaust came into play, in particular the fact that everything looks so nice as to be unreal. I also have the sense that the film is insisting that I like and respect it simply because of the subject matter. Its not that simple you have to give me characters and a good story before I care. Unfortunately while Brody is an excellent actor however I never connected to him. I never had a reason to care other than what happened was truly remarkable, which means this movie meant nothing to me. This film is a major disappointment",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
"Less 'cinematic' yet more affecting than ""Schindler's List"" ...","To think that I avoided ""The Pianist"" for about 10 years because I expected a new ""Schindler's List""! And I don't even mean that negatively.I've watched Spielberg's film several times and know too well how painful Holocaust movies are, and while ""Life is Beautiful"" was a tragicomic fable and ""Sophie's Choice"" more of a character study relating a traumatic experience, I knew ""The Pianist"" would be on the same level of ambition and seriousness than Spielberg's film, if only because it was directed by Roman Polanski, a Holocaust survivor himself. I knew the movie would feature shocking arbitrary executions and poignant separations, so in a way, ""The Pianist"" was already having an impact on me without watching it. But this is not the only reason why I didn't feel the urge to watch it.Part of the blame is to be put on the film itself although it was inevitably going to be compared with its 'glorious' predecessor. Speaking of my own experience, I was mislead by ""The Pianist"" and the movie trailers. I thought it was the story of a man who played music for the Nazis and his survival, and therefore found in the present's horror and gloominess a heaven of escapism in the inner, universal and timeless beauty of music. Wladislaw would have the state of mind of one of Schindler's factory workers with music as the same weapon as Guido's humor and optimism in ""Life is Beautiful"". Of course, I realize now how my preconceived ideas totally underestimated Roman Polanski and I hope this review redeems my 10 years of abstinence.First, one must give to Spielberg what is Spielberg's and to Polanski what is Polanski's. ""Schindler's List"" is a better directed film but ""The Pianist"" is a better told story. And while the directing of Spielberg betrays sometimes the harshness of its subject by too much 'mise en scene', Polanski's ability to hook our hearts to the fate of Wladislaw Spillman, magnificently portrayed by Adrien Brody, and his family is beyond words. Indeed, we feel like part of this family. While the epic scope of ""Schindler's List"" provided a sort of moral aura to the victims, making the film a martyrdom's remembrance, ""The Pianist"" is simply the chronicles of a banal horror. And Polanski keeps an intimate, almost unnoticeable directing, to better convey the feeling that we're watching normal people whose lives are dramatically affected by an absurd War, and it's their very normality that emphasizes the cruelty of the Nazi treatment.The film opens in Warsaw in September 1939 so those with a minimum of historical knowledge understand the implication. Wladislaw is playing Chopin in a studio when the first German bombings are heard, his family wants to leave but later, they learn in the radio that France and Britain entered the War. Relieved, they celebrate the news with a toast, and the relatively cheerful ambiance contrasts with the usual demonstrations of grief and pain. Of course, we know the worst is to come, but Polanski takes his time to get us immersed in the war's ambiance and letting us observe the progressive decline of the Spillmans, directly mirroring the atmosphere that probably prevailed within all the Jewish families.Through the Spillman's perspectives, we get a more accurate idea of the nightmare endured by Polish Jews. When they're all parked in the Warsaw ghetto, before the inevitable evacuation, we witness gut-wrenching, intolerable, and acts of brutality, so unbelievably gratuitous and horrific, we never doubt that they're based on true stories, and that war, definitely, inspires the worst from humanity. In war, there's no room for dignity, for charity, for understanding, for God I would even say. As for violence, there is no scale, soldiers throwing off a balcony an old grandfather on a wheelchair because he couldn't stand is a horrifying sight, but maybe I expected these kind of moments so much that I was more shocked by the part where the soldiers made people dance together. Sometimes, humiliations are more impacting than random and arbitrary killings.And again, the talent of Polanski is precisely not to have overplayed on the directing department: no 'Black and White', no special effects, no 'little girl in Red', just basic colors, as to sustain the feeling of a present, more real then more horrific. ""Schindler's List"" might be a better film for some, but it's still a film, while ""The Pianist"" is a survival story, raw and real. Not a hero, not a victim either, the main protagonist will sometimes count on his courage, sometimes on his good luck, sometimes on the help of good-hearted and understanding people, from any sides. There is a light of hope in the film, through music, at a time where humanity reached its lowest point, music was here to remind people, to remind Nazis what a waste the War was, a feeling incarnated by Adrien Brody's sad-looking eyes.Again, don't expect a hero à la Oskar Schindler in Wladislaw, ""The Pianist"" shows the boldness of a period where cowardice was sometimes guided by survival instinct, where the desire to live could be more necessary than the desire to fight, because surviving left more voices to speak about the atrocities. ""The Pianist"" reveals those hidden subtleties that couldn't be truly expressed in epic movies. Some Jews didn't fight back precisely because the horrors of Auschwitz, Treblinka, Buchenwald had to be known, and ironically, this was one of the reasons that accelerated the exterminations' process. And some like Wladislaw had to hide not to make the sacrifices of the others unnecessary, those were tough times and no one is allowed to put a judgment... not us, anyway.And this is why ""The Pianist"" is more affecting than ""Schindler's List"", and if one has any doubt, let's not forget, that Spielberg was born in 1946 while Roman Polanski is still a war survivor who lost his mother in a Death Camp.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
One scene of Szpilman Plays the Piano for the German Officer,"One of the most poignant and memorable scenes in ""The Pianist"" is when Szpilman (played by Adrien Brody) plays the piano for German officer Captain Wilm Hosenfeld (played by Thomas Kretschmann) in a ruined building. This moment is a powerful intersection of humanity, art, and survival amidst the horrors of World War II.Emotional Intensity:The scene is charged with emotional intensity. Szpilman, emaciated and broken, is given a rare opportunity to play the piano after years of hiding and struggling for survival. The music he plays is a haunting reminder of his lost world and the cultural devastation of the war.The interaction between Szpilman and Captain Hosenfeld highlights the complexity of human nature. Hosenfeld, a German officer, shows compassion and a sense of humanity by allowing Szpilman to play and later helping him survive.

This is the most raw movie Ive ever seen.Very realistic and raw scenes and script that describes the Nazi invasion very accurate.
Very hard to watch film, especialy for more sensitive people. I personaly dont get sensitive with movies and I handle violence scenes , but this is not about violence, its about war rawness and unbelievable documents. (Dead kids rotting on roads, Nazi killing random people, execution , etc.)

Beautifully tuned piece of cinema,"Far from the first motion picture to deal with the Holocaust and unlikely to be the last, this is nevertheless a stunning piece of film.  Brody portrays the title character (based on an actual person) who plays piano on Polish radio until the Nazi invasion of his country makes it impossible to continue.  Through his eyes, the audience witnesses the continual, seemingly-unstoppable dehumanization of Brody and his family and the virtual destruction of Poland.  The journey that this character takes, undoubtedly enhanced by director Polanski's own recollection of his early life, is almost incomprehensible.  Since so many films have been released on this subject, one can't help noticing the similarity to other movies and the familiarity of the situations depicted in the opening scenes.  However, the utter craftsmanship of this film and the casting (nothing short of perfection down the very last role) set this apart until the story's uniqueness kicks in.  Brody is nothing short of magnificent.  His face reflects (naturally and without mugging) the soulfulness, humiliation and deprivation of his character.  Polanski does a superb job of recreating the world of WWII Poland.  Every detail of the film is exact and mesmerizing (helped greatly by casting non-name actors who inhabit their roles with great feeling and authenticity.  There is no opportunity to play ""spot the star"" except for the most seasoned filmgoer.)  What happens to Brody is so startlingly, stunningly jaw-dropping it seems surreal at times.  Amazingly, Polanski is able to occasionally inject the faintest touches of black humor and irony to this, which makes for some very intriguing viewing.  That is not to say that the film is easy to watch.  Already a master (for decades) of creating feelings of unease, paranoia and fear in the viewer, Polanski sets into motion a film in which the audience can hardly breathe for fear that their own noise will result in the discovery of the frequently hidden Brody.  The film is notable for making sounds such as marching boots, idling cars and faraway voices seem more terrifying than anything Hollywood has ever had to offer in all of its multitudinous thrillers and horror films. If there are any faults in the film, they are few.  Perhaps some of Brody's experiences seem repetitive at times and the depiction of Germans sometimes approaches caricature.  However, all is forgiven as the story reaches its heart-stopping moment when Brody is attempting to open an all-important can of food.  Here the film reaches brilliance.  Clearly, the film is not going to appeal to the shallow or the disinterested, but to those who have a fondness for striking, deeply-felt and lovingly-told stories, this one is hard to top.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
"""That's what we have to believe""","The Pianist is a movie that often gets bundled together with Schindler's List as being ""about"" the holocaust. But this is a misunderstanding, a simplification even, of this picture (and of Schindler's List). It relates to the holocaust, but it is not the story of the holocaust – it's the story of one man. Władisław Szpilman was an artist, with great talent in his hands and his mind, and in him is represented something very precious in humanity. He also appears, as many such people really are, someone to whom the music mattered far more than current affairs. As such, he provides a unusual view on atrocity, that of someone who, rather than actively fight against it, for the most part tried simply to exist in spite of it.This somewhat passive yet dignified stance is ably reflected in Roman Polanski's direction, which has always been characterised by an excruciating intimacy with his subjects and a certain detachment from the world in which they inhabit. Here we see Szpilman glimpsing the war through windows and doorways, yet often himself or his hands in close-up. But Polanski's boldest strokes of genius are in his creation and presentation of the ghetto and its inhabitants, especially as regards how he draws our attention. The soldiers giving a cigarette to an elderly Jewish man and the couple fighting over a can of stew are foregrounded. Seconds later, a corpse lies innocuously in the background. When Władek's father is accosted by two Germans, we see a couple of Polish women hastily get out of the way. When the shot changes to reveal the officer's back, the focus is suddenly on his gun holster – it draws our attention to things that give a little extra breadth and context to a scene.Central to The Pianist is Adrien Brody's portrayal of the title character. It's an incredibly sedate performance, with everything below the surface, utterly commanding of our attention despite its understatement. His emotions seem muted – when reunited with a friend the merest ghost of a smile plays across his lips, but by now we know the character and understand that this is a deep and sincere expression. Brody virtually carries the movie alone, and one of the unfortunate things about The Pianist is that not one other performance stands out at all, and the inadequacy of some of the supporting players does hurt the earlier scenes a little.But perhaps the greatest thing about The Pianist is in the fine construction of its story. Although most of it is based incredibly faithfully on Szpilman's own memoir, the adaptation by Ronald Harwood gives it a certain dramatic course. There is one intensely poignant scene, and one of the few entirely fictionalised episodes, in which Szpilman is being sheltered by Dorota, wakes to the sound of her cello-playing and, just for a moment, he can imagine what life would be like if she had been his wife. Finally, the scene where Hosenfeld asks Szpilman to play for him seems to be the key to the whole thing. It's as if every moment, every narrative line, points towards that scene. We've seen Germans forcing Jews to dance for their entertainment, which makes us first question Hosenfeld's motives. We've seen Szpilman's desperation to be reunited with a piano, his fingers making keystrokes in the air. In retrospect, this all seems a set-up for that encounter. In effect, The Pianist becomes a tale of a harrowing time, filtered through the beauty of a musical performance.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Touching,"Then why the fu****g coat?I'm cold.Rate movie, not the director.I know Polanski did something bad, but let's be honest he is great director.This movie is so touching.9 / 9.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
A mirror to our own conscience,"Generally, I skim through the user comments on IMDB taking great pleasure in seeing what others have to say about the film I've just seen. Today, though, I feel astonished and disappointed by some of the things I've read.The holocaust occurred for many reasons; social, economic and political. However, what fuelled it was a colossal failure of the basic human qualities of compassion, empathy and understanding. It's a nauseating paradox, repeated throughout human history, that when people are regarded as fit only for slavery and destruction it is their persecutors who are made truly subhuman by their actions.I'm not attempting to label the authors of some of the posts here as Nazis or fascists but I am deeply concerned that a film dealing with this issue can provoke such truly thoughtless comments. Of course, it's possible to accuse The Pianist of failing in its ambitions if it cannot convey to every viewer at least a fleeting sympathy with the characters. Perhaps, though, it succeeds by highlighting the lack of comprehension that makes obscenities like the Holocaust possible even today.Maybe some people viewed the film as simply entertainment, in which case I can see why the plot or characterisation might not be to their liking. The Nazis just keep on behaving like thugs, the Jews sit there and take it and the central character doesn't finally go on a revenge killing-spree, liberating Warsaw single-handed. And getting the girl, of course. If you want formulaic movies with sympathetic heroes and a nice, untaxing storyline there are plenty to choose from. I just don't see how anyone could watch this film without understanding that it's about as close to the truth as it could be without passing into the realm of dramatised documentary. Yes, it is based on a true story and sorry - real life has a habit of occasionally deviating from the popcorn norm.So, sorry to pick on the following. Genuinely, it's not personal - your comments are simply the most recent.musidora - If you found it hard to relate to the selfishness of Szpilman perhaps you might consider that many, many Holocaust survivors report an ineradicable guilt, even in the face of all they endured, because they owed their own survival to putting themselves first. For example theft of food in concentration camps was common. What do you think you would do in the same situation if the price of your life, or your child's, were a crust of stolen bread?kylan-1 - You wrote: `He just stands there with a dumb look on his face and fumbles around'   `So whats the big survival story here?'Seriously, if you were malnourished, cold and being used for slave labour do you think you'd be feeling chipper enough to be a modern-day Spartacus?jmrex - You wrote: `How can anybody enjoy watching a chronicle of how lacking in spirit these people were? It sickens me.'It really is hard to understand how a whole people can sometimes kneel before its oppressor, seemingly without putting up a fight. How can people be so passive in such extreme circumstances? How can they just stand by while their neighbour is murdered and quietly wait their turn? Well, the same thing happens every time the human race decides to turn on itself. From Poland to Cambodia to Rwanda you can see it repeated. Plainly, it's something that happens when a society is reduced to its component individuals and the moment of rebellion seems to each an impossibility. If anything is sickening here, it's your comment, jmrex. If you truly find the concept of human despair something inferior to you in some way then let's put another point on the scoreboard for the Nazis. If all you want to do is simply enjoy a film and leave it feeling better than when you entered the cinema then look for something different next time. The audience leaving the screening I saw were subdued and said their goodbyes to one another with choked voices. That doesn't make any of them better people than you but I think it shows a maturity that you haven't yet reached. I wish you well on your journey there - you'll find the view much better.Bhagwan Thadani  - You wrote: `The entire movie was so ""outre"" that I actually laughed when a German officer pulled out his Luger and shot a Jewess to death for asking ""Where are we going?"" How ridiculous can this myth of the Jew suffering at the hands of persecutors become?'Please tell me you're not serious. That you know this really went on. I simply cannot understand how anyone with even a passing knowledge of the Holocaust could really think this an exaggeration or regard it as a `myth.' Perhaps you should find the time to talk to some of the people whose families were reduced to a handful of individuals or even just a sole survivor. Maybe if you heard from someone who was there, still carrying the tattoo on their arm used to mark them like cattle, how their mothers, fathers, siblings and children were murdered you might begin to understand how woundingly misinformed you are. The Jews, gypsies, gays, dissidents and other victims of the Nazis were slaughtered both systematically and capriciously. If your life is worthless to someone with power over you then it is a matter of no consequence all to them to end it for the slightest reason.While blindness to the suffering of others, whoever and wherever they may be, remains a part of the human condition the subjects of movies like The Pianist will be not only moving but a salutary warning. It could happen to any of us unless we appreciate the lessons history offers.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Sobering Depiction Of Warsaw Under German Occupation,"The first thing that should be said is that this is most definitely more than a Holocaust movie. Although that dreadful event stands firmly in the background, this movie is really about one man's struggle for survival. The one man is Polish Jewish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman. Adrien Brody played that lead role, and he played it well. Szpilman comes across as both pitiful in his desperation to survive but at the same time as noble in his desperation to survive. Brody portrays him as a man with great dignity. It was a challenging role, because as the movie progresses, there's less and less dialogue for the simple reason that almost everyone except Szpilman has been taken by the Nazis. Brody ends up playing long stretches without voice, but it doesn't stop him from rendering a brilliant portrait of the man, whose friends and family are gone and who simply tries to live day by day hoping for a way out of this madness. Just as haunting are extended scenes in which director Roman Polanski simply shows us a devastated Warsaw - not just the Jewish ghetto, but other parts of the city as well. The scenes of rubble, the scenes of innocent people being gunned down in the street by German soldiers - sometimes just for sport, without any other obvious reason, the scenes of burned out buildings. It's all haunting.For all that - and all that was very good - there was something about the story that didn't really click with me. For some strange reason I found it difficult to follow and I did think that at almost two and a half hours it was a little bit too long. As much as was accomplished in that running time could have been accomplished in two hours flat. It's a good movie, but just failed to reach the level of greatness that some have assigned to it. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Amazing movie,"I believe this movie to be one of the most excellent movies of our times. It has several aspects that make it especially great. Firstly, the music, the most important feature of this movie, in my opinion. Chopin nocturnes and polonaises are perfectly chosen and arrayed to create an unforgettable atmosphere. In one scene, they even take time to play the whole piece of music, without interfering. Secondly, the actors in the movie: none of them are/were really well known, but WOW! (for lack of a better word). Thirdly, it's one of the few movies, where you can actually watch the credits (forever) and wish the movie wouldn't end.Personally, I think it's a perfect 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
It's like Schindler's List only I care,"I don't go as far as saying holocaust movies are vanity projects of directors showing that they too can make an epic.But where Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" was somewhere way in the distance and ages ago,""The Pianist"" puts you in the action with the old trick of having a main character you care about.Bit by piece we get to see the downfall of the Jewish community in well,everywhere.Originally they just get discriminated and won't get to do anything to be anywhere,but are still members of society who usually don't get killed.Then it gets ugly.The ghettos,the incredible lack of everything,the random executions,I knew they existed but never have they seemed so sincere on behalf of the makers.What to say about an old man eating what appears to be liquid corn straight of the road?Eventually we learn yet again that the holocaust in fact,really made no sense.We're talking about Western Europe here,and it isn't even a long time ago.People were somewhat educated,thought for themselves when the Gestapo wasn't watching,and still most of them just went along with this crap.I was fearing a ""Night Of The Living Dead""-style ending,but this is based on an autobiography so that would have been impossible.Five years of hate packed in about two hours,and it works.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
"""...10 minutes into the film, I was captivated.""","""Crap, I rented the History Channel."" That was my initial reaction when I was met with a 20 second long, low-detailed, roll-footage type introduction to The Pianist. I knew I didn't need another lecture on the ""horrific Nazi death camps"" and one more dull lesson on World War II weaved into what Hollywood puts out as a ""movie."" However, about 10 minutes into the film, I was captivated. As the story began to unfold the life of a large and happy Jewish family living in Warsaw at the beginning of World War II, I started to see traces of genius in Polanski's newest creation.For one, each character had a personality so tangible that the viewers can point out resemblances in their own personal lives. This had a stunning impact on me. It just isn't the same when a story is always about that ""someone else."" However, Polanski did an awesome job in making that ""someone else"" personal. One of my own favorite characters was Henryk (played by Ed Stoppard), the brother of the ""pianist"" (Wladek Szpilman-played by Adrien Brody), who had a stubborn, intellectual, street-smart whim to him that I can identify in a few of my own friends. Of course, Brody was a great actor as well. His passive, stoic response flowed from a seemingly natural-born personality that was so fitting to his character. His personality was never out of place or awkward but well-blended into the climate set by Polanski.Secondly, the director had an excellent charm with the mood of the cinematic. It's interesting to point out that the sky had nearly always been dark and dreary. The clouds and the overall attitude of the film were grey and overcast. They resembled harbingers of a coming storm. It was symbolic, and also foreshadows the coming doom that few people expected and even fewer had hoped to avoid. Polanski, himself a Pole who escaped the grips of death in the camps, spared few shades of darkness in painting the Nazis. Next, it must be noted that Polanski was a master at contrasting mood. A tragically horrifying scene could be followed by a scene with Wladek playing the piano beautifully in a bustling restaurant. By doing this, Polanski noticeably heightens the blow of the calamity and as a result, made the movie so much more spectacular.Also helping to set the sinister mood was the music, which was stunningly beautiful yet overwhelmingly poignant. From Chopin's ""Nocturne for Piano in C Sharp Minor"" at the very beginning to Chopin's ""Andante Spianato and Grande Polonaise for Piano, Op. 22"" at the very end, the bittersweet sweet aura of the movie cannot exist without the music. One of the best classical soundtracks of the past years may be from this very movie. The piano genius, Szpilman, represented all the talents wasted away by Nazi rule. Lawyers, writers, politicians, and musicians alike were the subjects of those mass graves and human ovens, and the trills of the keys made it so real, so heartfelt. It was something one needs to experience to know the truth of.I encountered only a few moments of discontent when watching this movie. One of them was that some of the characters seemed quite random and generally impromptu. Itzak Heller for example, the Jewish Police recruiter, seemed to appear out of nowhere, yet the family speaks of him as if he was an old friend. Other parts of the story I felt needed a little bit more elaboration as well. What annoyed me the most was that the director seemed to part with the rest of the family in the middle of the film without ever mentioning them again. However, since this is not a spoiler, I have no need to go into the details.No, I have yet to see a movie that is perfect in every aspect. Though in this human world of flaws and opinions differing from mine, I forfeit my dissatisfaction at the beginning of this film to admit that this has been one awesome experience. It has not only changed my view on Polanski as a director, but also the entire period of the Holocaust in general.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

I feel dumb that I did not watch this brilliant film earlier.,"Fortunately my wife convinced me to see this film on TV several nights ago; initially I was reluctant because I thought that it would end up being too tough for a overly sensitive softy like myself-how wrong I was! Polanski's film was not what I had expected; in all the publicity surrounding his return to films, I had failed to grasp the substance of the film. In hindsight this surprises me because for many years I have been curious as to why film makers had not focused on the extraordinary events of the Warsaw Ghetto and its eventual destruction by the Nazis. I have always thought that this event was one of the most powerful of a string of events that have been overlooked by film makers for years. The enormity of all that happened from '38 to '45 seem to have prevented people from mining the history of those years. It is conceivable that producers feel there is a fatigue clause at work here, meaning that there is possibly a feeling by producers that the public might be tired of non-military war films. Another possibility concerns the Jewish people themselves-a concern that they do not want this terribly painful history to be mined simply to provide fodder for film makers. Whatever the reason, there is to my mind a noticeable absence of films about these monumental but painful events of the mid twentieth century.Even given the drawbacks associated with watching a film on the small screen, this movie immediately gave the impression that it had the touch of genius about it. Polanski's superb direction; Brody's superb acting and Edelman's brilliant cinematography impart the stamp of excellence on the film. I am a film viewer who watches films as collections of images so Edelman's work knocked me out! The beauty of the clarity and darkness of the camera work was wonderful to watch. POlanski's shot selection of course allowed Edelman ample canvas upon which to paint in those wonderful grays and muted colours that were eventually seen on the screen.Diane and I have the tape of the film and it will definitely be watched many times in the future. In short, the film is as good as the awards that it justifiably received.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Important and fascinating piece of work that I was made for all the right reasons.,"Roman Polanski is something of a genius for being in the middle of world history. Even if he had never made a film in his life his autobiography would still have been fascinating and history packed. I won't try and summate it in detail, but it involves an escape not unlike the one presented here on film! Having turned down Schindler's List (for reasons much noted elsewhere) he decides to make this as his tribute to the anti-Jewish horrors of WWII. Interesting.Despite the awards (all deserved) this is not what you might call a ""fat"" film. It has one main theme: ""self preservation"" in a world gone mad and that limits my sympathy and involvement. Indeed the protagonist (Adrian Brody) has something that people can envy even in his darkest hour - a great musical talent.The question I ask myself is how much of this lifesaver influences his decisions? While many gave up or joined in the resistance movement, Brody watches from the window: very much a curious and non Hollywood approach. Brave but not to everyone's taste.The real Warsaw Ghetto was featured in the great Granada documentary series ""The World at War"" (quite frankly the most amazing piece of historical television ever created - if you can rent it do so) and nothing can be as shocking as the real pictures. However this is a close second.The early scenes of family life are like the scenes from the Titanic, we know what those on screen don't and we feel like calling out and warning them! In many ways the information is soft peddled and tokenised. We do not see the actual horrors of the death camps and even post war the survivors look too healthy to be believable. The only bum note in the entire movie.Although I had nothing to do with the making of this film I am proud of it. I am proud that millions of people have been educated and will continue to be educated about the horrors of war and what man does to man. But I didn't really enjoy it very much and I have no desire to see it again despite having some wonderful pieces of cinematography.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

not really a polanski fan but...,"From the opening moments of this movie Polanski layers on the symbolism with a trowel. Gunshots and bombs disrupt Szpilman's piano playing, they have to hide their money in his father's violin, the nazis throw their neighbour out the window for no reason god oh god will it never end- and  that's just the beginning. Once the Szpilman's move into the ghetto Polanksi dispenses with the trowel, grabs us by the back of our necks and suffocates us face down into the bewildering grimy b-movie that was the Jewish experience of the second world war. His characters step over dead bodies on the sidewalk, and weave their way through crowds of parent-less children and distraught wives. There is always someone crying or wailing in the background. The nazis are brutal and grotesque with inane grins on their faces as they commit bizarre atrocities. The ghetto is a constant nightmarish gotham but, unlike Spielberg, Polanski refuses to couch this in artistic black and white, instead forcing us to view it all in the cold light of day. The colours are muted yes, but this has nothing to do with lens filters and everything to do with the layers of dirt that cover the city- a literal reminder of the s*** they have to live under everyday. Under Polanski's direction, every aspect of daily life is an exaggerated contribution to ghetto hell, the soundtrack is turned up way loud so that even chewing food and eating gruel is an interruption to intellgent thought. Polanksi is unashamedly symbolic and why not- he's got a point to get across and by god he's going to force it to its absolute limit. This is a movie deliberately directed at the west-- Polanski redefines the horrors of the ghetto by giving his characters the hearty english accents of childhood classics like The Railway Children. By doing this, he forces the viewer to frame Polish Jews inside the gentle 'civilised' culture we associate with the educated British accent, rather than a Polish or Jewish accent which most western movie makers portray as, at best, lower class and at worst, comical. And in the middle of this chaos is the relentlessly transcendent Szpilman. But this is no heroic champion of the people, he doesn't run guns, or operate an underground railway, he saves no one's life except his own, he doesn't fight the Germans he runs from them. This is a man who is persecuted by everybody: ghetto-ised by the nazis, starved and left to die by a man who is supposed to help him, and then, eventually, abandoned by the world. He wanders through the surreal ruins of the town like a man on an alien planet. Unable to find food or water, limping, thin as a rake a bearded Jesus-like figure. He is the ultimate victim - frustratingly passive, seemingly unaware of the political, always watching from behind a curtain, only ever active when its almost too late, if at all, operating on instinctual levels of self-preservation that have nothing to do with skill or bravery and is ultimately self-centred. He is a mundane every-man who is, literally, yellow- his cowardlyness physically manifested as he suffers from jaundice.So what makes us accept his salvation against the millions of others we know who died during WWII? Largely it's his phenomenal talent on the piano that gives him an excuse to bow out of the fight. His obsession with music gives him a voice even when he can't use it, and a way of escaping the muck of war. He spends his time in hiding imagining piano pieces rather than plotting revenge. Intelligent audiences today understand that vengeance is never simple, that every act of violence has a consequence, even if you're the good guy fighting the bad guys, nobody is ever completely bad or completely good.. In the end, his final saviour is a nazi soldier. We would never have believed this soldier's grace possible if it hadn't been for Spzilman's lack of hatred in the movie. Some might call him a wimp for his inability to fight the Germans, but it's his refusal to sink to the level of mindless fighter that leads to his salvation.This is the first movie of Polanski's  that has managed to thoroughly pull me in- usually he doesn't do it for me at all, maybe because he's so deliberately unsubtle? Whatever it was that he did differently it worked this time- I was so involved- longing for Spzilman to do something, fight someone, or at least for god's sake find some food.  That beautiful, delicate, completely expressive encounter with the piano and the nazi somehow encompasses the point of the whole movie in a way I can't explain and don't fully understand. Polanksi takes us on a journey that peaks at the moment where it is the most gentle- very unusual and something that doesn't always work. But somehow, here, it does.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

"The best of it's kind, and the best of Roman Polanski","They say that the best story you can tell is a true story, and considering World War 2 is one of the greatest historic devastations of man kind, you can understand why there have been so many instalments about this tragic, dark time in human society. Until now, I always thought 'Schindler's List' (by Steven Spielberg) to be the best of the WWII films, but then I came across 'The Pianist', directed by the highly acclaimed Roman Polanksi. The creator of 'Chinatown' and 'Rosemary's Baby' has truly out done himself with this incredibly powerful, visually compelling piece about the Jewish ghetto in Warshaw.The Pianist follows the story of piano player Wlad Spielzman and his constant struggle for survival in the German occupied city of Warshaw, which I have already mentioned. What started out as few new rules (the wearing of arm bands, the saluting of passing German officers on the sidewalk), became a vast series of evacuation orders, transporting, herding, and holding Jewish people as if they were animals. After managing to escape the latest ship out, Spielzman flees to the dead, empty roads and streets of Warshaw, living off only the kindness of strangers.One of the great things about this movie is that the main lead is neither a hero, or a blood thirsty rebel our for revenge, he's an ordinary man who's just trying to stay alive. This I think allows the viewers to really relate to him in some way, making them really care about what happens to him as he wanders the streets of Warshaw desperately look for means of support, food and shelter. It also adds a sense of realism, because when I think about it, if I was in that same position, which I'm very thankful that I wasn't, I wouldn't speak out, or stand up against those who clearly have the power over my life. I would remain silent and still, because under these conditions, being brave is just another word for being stupid.Adrien Brody's portrayal of a man who had his freedom, his livelihood, almost his whole life stolen away from him is so heart- breaking to watch, I'm very glad that he received an Academy Award for that performance (I was a little surprised when I found out that Adrien was the youngest person ever to receive an Academy Award, I mean 27 isn't that young is it?) Roman Polanksi's images of war do not focus as much on the spilling of blood as you may see in other modern war movies, however there were a few scenes of grittiness that added some dramatic effect. I personally enjoyed the pointless shooting of Jewish randoms, where they line up every marching Jew and take a bullet to the heads of a selection of those unlucky bunch. Steven Spielberg showed the same thing in ""Schindler's List"" and it had a considerably powerful essence to it. But back to my earlier point. ""The Pianist"" does not focus on bloody, visually enhanced images of war, but rather on the depriving treatment of the Jewish community. The insulting of not being able to sit on public benches, the demeaning humiliation forced by German soldiers for amusement, all add to the heartbreaking sense of helplessness which also creates more dramatic effect.One of my most favourite parts of the movie is the end, or close to it anyway. The scene when the German soldier finds Spielzman in an abandoned house trying to open a can of pickles. After explaining his story and finding out that he is a pianist the soldier asks him to play something, just at top of his head. After a considerably long silence and a beautiful piano solo, the soldier spares his life and hides him in the attic, secretly supplying bread and jam to him. The most enjoyable thing about this scene is that it really reflects the symbolism of the pianist's extraordinary musical gift, because in a dark time such as this, music is the only pure thing that still remains, and in the end it is the thing that saves the pianist's life.This is arguably the greatest of the WWII films. It's intelligent direction and efficiently powerful images are very hard to match and Adrien Brody made history with his wonderful portrayal of the deeply effecting piano player, Wlad Spielzman.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
"Poetic, Emotional and Haunting",My Rating : 9/10This movie stayed with me for a long time. It is emotionally gripping and the director has done justice to the brutality of the period it is set in.

"An Excellent Movie, Of Course","I don't have much to say on this movie, other than that it was very good. Adrien Brody is a fine actor and this is probably his finest role (though I'm partial to ""The Jacket"").My only real concern with this film ,and it shouldn't be seen as a slight against it, is that it seems that making a film about the Holocaust makes a film automatically better. I'm not sure if it's because it evokes emotions or what, but this film, ""Schindler's List"" and others quickly rise to the top of the list of good films... World War II in general seems to do this, but the Holocaust even more so. It's an odd phenomenon.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
An extraordinary look at one man's survival...brilliant performance by Adrien Brody...,"Words are inadequate to describe the flawless flow of events in this absorbing account of Polish Jews facing extinction in the Warsaw Ghetto of the '40s during the Nazi reign of terror.Surely the most deserving Oscar award in years was bestowed on Adrien Brody who captures his character completely and carries the film with his amazingly real performance. He is at the center of vision throughout most of the action--so perfect in his role that he makes the story an unforgettable experience. His confrontation with a Nazi officer who discovers his hiding place and then asks him to prove that he is a pianist by playing the piano, is just one of the memorable highlights. This scene alone was justification for Brody's Oscar.Roman Polanski's direction is masterful throughout, never allowing the story to bog down in sentimentality but keeping the focus on survival and some of the horrific things that happen along the way.An inspired piece of filmmaking that is stunning to watch because it is so real and moving.

The Pianist- Destruction Hits A Memorable Chord ****,"Surprise Oscar winner Adrien Brody is magnificent in Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist."" (It was thought by the experts that Daniel Day Lewis would win the award for ""Gangs of New York."") Polanski's win was a surprise since the conventional wisdom had Martin Scorsese for ""Gangs"" winning the directing award as well.This tremendous holocaust film deals with the destruction of a family. The scene where a family had its wheelchair bound member tossed from a window and then shot as they ran was eerie and never to be forgotten.As a marvelous piano player, Brody captured the role with depth and a strong conviction. The scene where the family is placed on a train for their ultimate destiny can and must never be forgotten as well. From that point on, the focus of the picture becomes one of survival as Brody is able to elude the Nazi barbarians.A strong film in the tradition of ""Schindler's List.""

Roman Polanski's 'The Pianist' is an unforgettable portrayal of human resilience in the face of war atrocities,"""The Pianist"" (2002) is a powerful, emotional and unforgettable film that tells the true story of pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman's survival during World War II. Director Roman Polanski creates an intensely realistic portrayal of the Warsaw Ghetto and the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime, while Adrien Brody gives a mesmerizing performance as Szpilman. The film is a masterful depiction of human resilience and the will to survive in the face of unimaginable horrors.Polanski's attention to detail and commitment to historical accuracy is evident throughout the film, from the realistic sets to the use of period-appropriate costumes and props. The film's cinematography, score, and sound design also add to the film's visceral impact, creating an immersive and emotionally charged viewing experience.Brody's performance as Szpilman is nothing short of extraordinary, capturing both the physical and emotional toll of his character's experiences. He conveys a range of emotions, from fear and desperation to hope and determination, with subtlety and nuance, earning him a well-deserved Academy Award for Best Actor.""The Pianist"" is a harrowing and deeply moving film that offers a sobering reminder of the atrocities of war and the importance of resilience, hope, and human kindness in the face of unimaginable horrors.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

Institutional Dehumanization,"Unlike many other reviewers, I will not compare this film to ""Schindler's List"". Although both films take place during the same era and are based on the same European Holocaust that occurred at the time, they are very different products with their own, unique perspectives and emphases. Each one is to be valued in its own right. Each one stands alone in its importance.Director Roman Polanski escaped from the Jewish ghetto of Krakow, Poland during World War II when the Nazis invaded his country. My mother and my maternal grandparents were born within an hour's drive from Krakow but were fortunate to leave Poland for the United States before the war. They caught the last boat out and landed in New York on Black Monday, October 28, 1929. After that date, it would have been impossible for them to leave Poland before the Germans invaded ten years later in 1939. Most of my grandfather's family remained in that area of southern Poland and were never heard from again after the invasion. Although centered in Warsaw, this film allowed me a glimpse of the brutality that my own family members certainly experienced in Poland during the war.Perhaps because of the personal connection, I found myself periodically turning the movie off in order to rest from its overwhelming intensity. There were times when I actually couldn't even breathe as I watched, undergoing a mixture of very strong feelings including anger, rage, sadness, disgust, and horror. If I experienced this reaction merely from watching the events unfold on a screen, how did the actual victims of such horrific violence and degradation feel as they actually lived through it?I commend Mr. Polanski for his very skillful and meticulous efforts in recreating the traumatic ordeal that he himself managed to survive. Among other dire conditions, the constant need for fundamental food, water, warmth, and sleep was very successfully conveyed from start to finish. I had already been a Polanski fan from ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""Chinatown"", among his other works, but now my admiration for his brilliance is sealed.Although the entire cast is excellent, the outstanding work of Adrien Brody as Wladislaw Szpilman, the pianist whose memoirs served as a basis for the film, was appropriately acknowledged with his Oscar as best actor. Like Polanski was in real life, he is forced into the role of powerless observer as he directly witnesses the worst atrocities imaginable. He plays the part perfectly, and his very expressive face, which does not always require words, surely helps him to accomplish the task at hand. Brody's highly controlled emotions do not explode until he sees his entire family being boarded onto the boxcar. Instinctively, he knows that he will never see any of them ever again as he wanders in a state of complete confusion and despair through the dangerous and deadly streets of Warsaw. Among all of the superb cast members, Thomas Kretschmann must also be recognized for his noteworthy performance as the German officer who spares Szpilman's life in appreciation of his talent as a musician.Aside from Kretschmann's character, Polanski was determined to recognize the noble and courageous efforts of non-Jewish Poles and Germans who risked their very lives and those of their families in order to save their fellow human beings. Again, this is based on Polanski's own, direct experience during the war. For all I know, one of the rural villages where Polanski found refuge could have been my own grandmother's tiny hamlet in the Carpathian foothills, not far from Krakow.What is most shocking and disturbing to me is how easy it is for a political regime, such as the Nazis in Germany during World War II, to dehumanize and humiliate an entire segment of the population, in this case a very sizeable one. After seeing this film, perhaps we can begin treating each other with the basic decency and respect that we deserve in spite of any differences that may divide us. Is it possible?",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
A depressing and soul-stirring experience.,"There have been some great Holocaust films made in the past such as Schindler's List but what Roman Polanski, Ronald Harwood and Adrien Brody brought to The Pianist make it one of the best Holocaust films ever made.The Pianist follows Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Jewish piano player, who tries to survive in the Polish ghetto during the Holocaust.There are very few films that leave me speechless by the end of it and The Pianist is no different. I remember just sitting as the credits rolled and thinking how lucky I was avoid such a brutal and inhumane period of time. The way Roman Polanksi directed this film is absolutely excellent. This is a very emotional experience that will bring you on the verge of tears because of how sad it is. Polanksi shows Nazi occupied Poland in such a brilliant way. I loved the ugly colour palette this film had as it reinforced how dark and depressing it was during that time. The way innocent people were shot for the smallest of things also showed the ruthless nature of the Germans and how difficult it was to survive. There is an absolutely fantastic shot at the end showing a whole row of destroyed buildings where I couldn't believe how cruel humanity was.I remember seeing Adrien Brody in films and TV shows like King Kong and Peaky Blinders but his performance in The Pianist is truly mesmerising. It's no surprise that he won an Oscar for it. I don't think I've ever felt this sympathetic towards a character in a film for a long time. Brody captures the helplessness and vulnerability of Szpilman perfectly. I cared for him all the way and really wanted him to survive and it's mainly because of the range of emotion Adrien Brody is able to bring in his performance that I was able to do that.The Pianist is one of the greatest Holocaust films I've seen. It shows Nazi occupied Poland in a very honest and realistic way without sugarcoating any of it and conveys the struggle a Jewish man goes through as heartbreaking as possible. It's a definite must watch!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
A Musical War Materpiece,"This is one of the best War films ever made. Despite Roman Polanski's actions, this film's direction makes you feel like you are part of the world. Truely a piece of art. The movie may not be for everyone, expecially those who are very sensitive to violence and murder. But knowing that everything that happened in this film is true... That's just devistating. The messages to never give up and keep moving forward is amazing. The absolute pointlessness of what the Nazis did is so unsettling. They killed just for killing. The acting in this film is phenominal, from the body language to words spoken. Everyone involved did an amzing jobs with this film. Polanski's actions were wrong, but his directing and storytelling was undeniably great in The Pianist.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Beautiful,"It takes a lot of guts to make a film about arguably the most tragic event in human history. The director must put the film together with care and respect towards those depicted in the film. The writer must pay attention to the details of the events and bring them across in the most respectful nature without exploiting the events for cinematic gain. The actors must have the utmost care for the characters they portray in order to properly tell such a tragic story. Roman Polanski's The Pianist hits all these marks. The film is adapted from the memoirs of a famed Polish Jewish pianist named Wladyslaw Szpilman. It chronicles the events of the Jewish exile into the Polish ghettos and their eventual relocation to the concentration camps. Szpilman, however, was not taken to a concentration camp and had to spend months hiding out from the Germans as they destroyed Warsaw, Poland. It is a very difficult story to portray, as well as watch, making it a harrowing yet memorable piece of art.I would never have known you could make such a despicable event such as this into such a glorious work of art. But Roman Polanski does it. He directs this film with such gracious beauty that shocks and mystifies the viewer. It is a film you can't take your eyes off of, no matter how much you want to. It is strange to call this such a beautiful film, but it is. It isn't beautiful in the sense that we often associate beauty with. It is beautiful in its portrayal of such tragic events through such a subtle and meticulous lens. Polanski directs every bit of this film with the utmost respect towards the subject matter. He stays so far away from making this an exploitation film and instead makes into into a work of art where the tragedy we witness on screen is almost hypnotic in its depiction.And to add to the emotional brilliance of this film, Adrien Brody does a fantastic job as Szpilman. His portrayal earned him an Academy Award for best actor and it's not difficult to realize why. He goes through such an dramatic transformation throughout this film, both physical and mental. He begins as an esteemed Polish pianist who is very likable and very homely. He has a loving family and a great career. But as the destruction of Warsaw caves in around him, so does his whole life. When he is separated from his family he must look after nobody but himself. It is very difficult to watch his tragic physical and mental deterioration. You think he's lost it all until the end of the film when you realize just how much he retains. Szpilman is not a pianist just to add a different kind of aspect to the film. He is a pianist because this supports the entire idea of the film. He shows just how important music and art is to the world, even in such tragic times. His ability to play the piano so well saves his life, as well as renews it. It is a fascinating thing to think about, even though it is something very subtle in the film.All this being said, The Pianist didn't strike as many emotional chords with me as I thought it would. I'm not sure why, but I was more mystified with the quality of the film, rather than emotionally moved by the events. They are undoubtedly tragic and still difficult to watch, but I didn't feel a lot of emotion boiling up inside of me while watching this film. I only felt a sincere amazement by how well the film was put together and how great Adrien Brody was. I am in no way saying this isn't an emotional film, but it just wasn't as striking to me as it would be to other people. I feel like more could have been done with this film, but at the same time I feel like there was just enough in this film to give it its consistent subtle beauty. I wasn't quite as drawn in by this film as I thought I would be, but it is undoubtedly excellent.The Pianist is a beautiful film. I wasn't moved by it enough for it to earn a spot in one of my all time favorite films, but it is a film experience I will never forget. I will always remember just how well constructed this story was and how successfully beautiful of a film it was. This is an unforgettable film that shows what dramatic historical filmmaking is all about.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
he was pleased to tell the story,"Roman Polanski, clearly was keen to make this film, having himself born in Paris in 1933 and then with his parents returning to Krakow three years later.

It did not have as big a budget as he would have hoped for but the film is done well enough although it is rather long without too much happening.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
A Perfect Film,"This will be the first IMDb rating I'll make as I have more to go, but this is a perfect movie. Adrien Brody's acting is spectacular, and the movie would have been different if someone else played this role. This film was heart-breaking, in which I cried 5 times throughout and then uncontrollably right after. I never cried that hard about a movie before. This movie hits some part of yourself and is a film that would make anyone feel on the inside like you want to crumble and your heart just shatters. I feel like it would be hard to compare this movie to ""Schindler's List"" because although they're both talking in the same time period/era, the plot of each movie don't correlate with each other at all. ""Schindler's List"" talks about Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) who saved hundreds of Jews during WWII. (It's been a while since I've seen it but I remember crying so hard my nose bled three times throughout) But then again, The Pianist talks about an individual who lost everything and struggled to stay alive.

He sees a lot and he has to deal with many difficulties and surpass a lot of obstacles in order to survive.I liked this movie very much because it is based on true events and it presents very well the true face of World War II. The direction which was made by Roman Polanski, it was for one more time simply exceptional and he created another masterpiece. He succeeded on making us understand how his main character was feeling and made it easier for us to follow his story. The interpretation of Adrien Brody who played as Wladyslaw Szpilman was simply amazing and he deserved the Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Emilia Fox's who played as Dorota and Thomas Kretschmann's who played as Captain Wilm Hosenfeld.

Tear-jerker,"Tear-jerker. Although that dreadful event stands firmly in the background, this movie is really about one man's struggle for survival. The one man is Polish Jewish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman. Adrien Brody played that lead role, and he played it well. Szpilman comes across as both pitiful in his desperation to survive but at the same time as noble in his desperation to survive. Brody portrays him as a man with great dignity. It was a challenging role, because as the movie progresses, there's less and less dialogue for the simple reason that almost everyone except Szpilman has been taken by the Nazis. Brody ends up playing long stretches without voice, but it doesn't stop him from rendering a brilliant portrait of the man, whose friends and family are gone and who simply tries to live day by day hoping for a way out of this madness. Just as haunting are extended scenes in which director Roman Polanski simply shows us a devastated Warsaw - not just the Jewish ghetto, but other parts of the city as well. The scenes of rubble, the scenes of innocent people being gunned down in the street by German soldiers - sometimes just for sport, without any other obvious reason, the scenes of burned out buildings. It's all haunting.For all that - and all that was very good - there was something about the story that didn't really click with me.

The scenes are realistic and the pace of movie is pretty steady but fluent and the whole effect does get upon the viewer. The end part was specially touching. It depicted that we remain the same old good and bad humans and Germans were no different. Probably, it's an excellent way to let the society feel the pain that humans can bring to one another. Adrien Brody has been on his lifetime best and let's all thank Roman Polanski for this creation. The spirit calls for introspections and resolve. We remain humans as long as humanity exists.

"You feel the fear, you feel the despair, you feel everything","The pianist shows very impressively how people lived respectively suffered at that time. Unimaginable suffering and injustice is done to the people. Life is restricted for no reason. Access to cafes, a visit to the park or sitting on a bench, supposedly self-evident things are forbidden.In retrospect, these restrictions seem almost trivial. The movie shows how the lives of Jewish people gradually become worse and worse. Of course you know where it's going, but that's what gives it even more intensity. Always in the middle, Wladyslaw Szpilman, who tries as far as possible not to attract attention. What other choice do you have if you want to survive. Those who resist or breathe too loudly in the wrong place die. With all his strength and willpower, he lets everything wash over him.Bombing of the immediate neighborhood, up-close shootings and starving people represent everyday life. People are arbitrarily humiliated and harassed. People are grasping at any straw for a bit of hope to get out of this hell alive.The movie does not spare cruelty and shows it consistently. Downplaying would also be the wrong thing to do here. People live in constant fear and you can feel that at all times. The movie primarily follows the lives of the people up close and gives rather little insights into the regime itself. In the ghetto itself, you see how people deal with the events in different ways. Desperation, fear, pure hatred and those who just try not to stand out.Overall, the movie addresses a part of history that must never be forgotten. Of course, you cannot image how bad it really was for the people, but the movie impressively conveys a feeling for it. But through movies of this kind, you always recall these chapters of history in your mind and they make you think about it.Definitely watch it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

Powerful movie!,"Central to The Pianist is Adrien Brody's portrayal of the title character. It's an incredibly sedate performance, with everything below the surface, utterly commanding of our attention despite its understatement. His emotions seem muted - when reunited with a friend the merest ghost of a smile plays across his lips, but by now we know the character and understand that this is a deep and sincere expression. Brody virtually carries the movie alone, and one of the unfortunate things about The Pianist is that not one other performance stands out at all, and the inadequacy of some of the supporting players does hurt the earlier scenes a little.But perhaps the greatest thing about The Pianist is in the fine construction of its story. Although most of it is based incredibly faithfully on Szpilman's own memoir, the adaptation by Ronald Harwood gives it a certain dramatic course. There is one intensely poignant scene, and one of the few entirely fictionalised episodes, in which Szpilman is being sheltered by Dorota, wakes to the sound of her cello-playing and, just for a moment, he can imagine what life would be like if she had been his wife. Finally, the scene where Hosenfeld asks Szpilman to play for him seems to be the key to the whole thing. It's as if every moment, every narrative line, points towards that scene. We've seen Germans forcing Jews to dance for their entertainment, which makes us first question Hosenfeld's motives. We've seen Szpilman's desperation to be reunited with a piano, his fingers making keystrokes in the air. In retrospect, this all seems a set-up for that encounter. In effect, The Pianist becomes a tale of a harrowing time, filtered through the beauty of a musical performance.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Hugely overrated,"I despise the term overrated (partly because of its often use on IMDB) but this movie is the dictionary definition of the term. How did it win those oscars? Why it is in the top 250? I don't know.Polanski's tribute to the holocaust is a largely pedestrian affair that suffers from a lack of style and tautness. The inclusion of many scenes in the movie is mysterious considering the fact they hold little relevance to either the holocaust or the Brody's character's story. The film therefore feels bloated and self-important. Polanski does not treat the subject matter with any opinion or style- and just shows us what happens before casually strolling onto the next scene. Polanski would argue that this is because the subject matter does not need any style or opinion added to it, which is fair enough. However the problem with this is, that it is extremely dull for the audience.The ""powerful"" elements of the movie are few and far between, bluntening their impact. Also, towards the middle of the film, there seems to be a genuinely scary lack of substance and we get treated to lots of long shots contrasted with close-ups. What this is supposed to tell us, is also a mystery.While the movie must be commended for its treatment of the subject matter and Adrien Brody's excellent performance, it feels more guided rather than directed. Its casual attitude to the violence seems mundane rather than shocking and there is nothing here that Steven Spielberg didn't do better in Schindler's List. Essentially dull, rather than powerful, only the last 45 minutes make this film memorable. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

Cinema is his Passion. The Pianist is his Masterpiece.,"Helmed by a Holocaust survivor himself yet presenting an objective take on the disturbing subject matter, The Pianist is the most personal film renowned director Roman Polanski has made in his decades-spanning career for it is crafted with meticulous care n attention, told with immaculate simplicity & also happens to feature one of cinema's most extraordinary performances.Based on the memoir of the same name & set in Warsaw during the Second World War, The Pianist tells the story of Władysław Szpilman; a Polish-Jewish musician who after avoiding deportation to Nazi labour camps tries to elude capture by living in the ruins of his city. The plot details his miraculous survival against all odds which wouldn't have happened without the kindness of few compassionate humans.Directed by Roman Polanski, The Pianist does bring back the horrors of the Holocaust and never shies away from depicting the barbaric treatment millions of Jews underwent during Nazi occupation. But it's not a tale about someone who caused an uprising or put his life on the line to save others but through one person, it tries to capture what most people under same circumstances were trying to do: survive, no matter what it takes.Polanski does manage to infuse his own history into the story but never lets that distract his own vision for the picture at hand, and there in lies the true beauty of this survival story. It's arguably the finest film that he's made & certainly the most artistic. Adding more strength to the feature is the brilliantly-written screenplay that keeps the focus on our protagonist at all times & resonates the brutality that millions underwent through his own life story.Coming to the technical aspects, every single element only ends up enhancing the entire experience. Production Design team does a superb job in recreating the war-torn city & set pieces are refined to smallest of details. Cinematography makes impeccable use of camera in capturing every frame plus the cold colour temperature encapsulates the whole film with a bleak mood. Editing paces its 149 minutes of runtime with precision. And classical music is beautifully incorporated into the narrative.Another thing that seals the destiny of The Pianist is the exceptional performance by Adrien Brody in the role of Władysław Szpilman that simply exceeded every expectation. Perfectly capturing not just the feeling of hopelessness, loneliness, grief & living under constant fear but also the desperation, survival instinct & passion for music, what Brody delivers here is one of cinema's most memorable performances that still ranks as his best and his Academy Award win for this role was deserving in every manner.On an overall scale, The Pianist marks the career high moment for Roman Polanski & Adrien Brody, is an emotionally devastating & powerfully moving cinema that's worthy of all the accolades it has garnered so far, and is amongst the finest examples of historical drama in existence. It certainly isn't going to be an easy sit for most but you'll be a better person for having done because some films, no matter how difficult, deserve to be viewed, and Roman Polanski's magnum opus is definitely one of those cinematic treasures. Strongly recommended.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
A Masterpiece,"A true masterpiece of a film, and Adrien Brody is the master actor such as I've never seen before. Until now I'd only seen him in the odd mafia flick, but in this he was sublime. All the actors gave amazing portrayals, but for me Brody stands out perhaps because of the extremes he was required to go to in this role. I'm not sure if Brody is a piano player, if he's not, then he may be the best actor I've ever seen. The viewer becomes invested in the characters of this film, but Brody is our guide through it all, and his character is the most developed of them all in this film. Others were scant where they could have been more full, maybe. The production quality, the settings, dismal depressing & terrifying scenes, all seemed nearly too real, one can easily lose themselves in this movie, immersing so fully it is nearly a shock when the ending comes & one is thrust back into the modern time and body. I had no idea this movie existed until today, nearly 10 years after its release. I watched it on a lark, not expecting anything of this level certainly.

So much suffering, so many places to accuse, incite, and provoke, were all avoided by Polanski using the simplest means of classical narrative techniques.

This is something that I know many directors are becoming increasingly difficult to do.

More than just a Movie,"How often do you see a movie that is capable of touching your Heart? how often do you see a movie that will occupy your thoughts for a good while? Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"" is one of those rare breed of movies that can actually do that. It's undoubtedly one of the most impressive movies you will ever see. From The Solid Direction Of Roman Polanski to the Flawless acting of Adrien Brody This Movie without a doubt can be called a Masterpiece. The Movie is based on The true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, who in the 1930s was considered one of the most accomplished Pianist. But the movie is not about his fame, Nor his Glory as a pianist. It's About A Polish Jew, who fought against all odds, Faced situations that he never even imagined and Finally Survived by losing almost everything and everyone he loved. It shows not only a tale of horrific surviving, but also the emotions that many people had to face and fight in order to live. It makes you wonder how people who really faced and Fought against those odd and lived, makes you ask yourself what would i do in that situation? The Cast is great, Whether it is a important character like Fox as Dorota or Minor character such as Ronan Vibert as Janina's Husband. But Adrian Broody Truly proved his worth as an actor in this film, i mean he was so into the character that he will make you believe that he really is Szpilman, He lost over 14 kilograms and developed a unusual body language for some scenes, and an actor of his level deserve much more recognition, but it's a fact that people nowadays prefer flash and looks over true art, however if you are one of those who can appreciate a true masterpiece you must have a look at ""The Pianist""",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Stamped with authenticity,"There may have been better written films about the holocaust - but this is without the most authentic and touching account I have seen since Claude Lanzmann's epic documentary ""Shoah"" - as you might expect from director Polanski, himself a child survivor of the Krakov and Warsaw ghettos.Here he eschews melodrama, and the pornography of violence to present of film which is full of love, life and hope amidst terrible events.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

All this, with the amazing acting and amazing soundtrack, create for a very depressing film. Also the cinematography is excellent. I do find that the middle Chunk of the movie, wasn't all that great...and I find it really hard to say anything negative on a movie about such a touching subject, but as solely a film stand point. The middle section is extremely repetitive and slow which ends up making it quite boring. The climax does turn it around but only very last minute, still a great ending though.

Five Not So Easy Pieces.,"Haunting adaptation based on the life of Polish Jew Wladyslaw Szpilman (portrayed by surprise Oscar-winner Adrien Brody), a somewhat sheltered young man who just takes life as it comes to him and of course has an uncanny knack for playing the piano. Timing is bad though for the titled character as the Nazi occupation of Poland is imminent and exile to death camps is a definite possibility. Brody and his family (parents Maureen Lipman and Frank Finley and siblings Ed Stoppard, Jessica Kate Meyer and Julia Rayner) quickly realize that things are going from bad to worse as life starts to spin out of control. Instructions in the newspaper foreshadow future hardships as the Star of David patches are demanded of all Jewish peoples to wear and then the dreaded ghettos follow. The film then becomes heart-wrenching, but a change occurs that allows Brody to be spared from the death camps. Now he must try to avoid the Nazi Regime and find an unbending will to survive against all odds. Help does come from fellow Jews and non-Nazi Germans. Emilia Fox makes a lasting impression as a woman that Brody falls in love with early on and then shows up again later in an important part. Thomas Kretschmann also stands out as a Nazi officer who has a change of heart during the film's latter moments (he is also linked to Brody because of his love for the piano). ""The Pianist"" is a film that fashions itself after Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"". This production is better in spots than the earlier movie, but as a whole it is not quite as impressive. ""The Pianist"" has a more exact focus and ends up being more of a one-man showcase for Brody in its second half. ""Cast Away"" meets the Holocaust would probably be the way to describe ""The Pianist"" when all is said and done. A brilliant adapted screenplay by Oscar-winner Ronald Harwood brings the novel to life. Roman Polanski finally struck Oscar gold for his unbelievable direction here (his work is on par with Scorsese's in ""Gangs of New York"" for the most part). He quietly became the oldest winner ever in the Academy's history in that particular category. All the supporters have well-calculated parts, but Brody's character is the most dominant of course. However, Brody never does reach the level of Liam Neeson in ""Schindler's List"" or even past Oscar-winner Roberto Benigni in ""Life Is Beautiful"". In fact his character is not near as complicated as the film would like. He is trying to survive and his motivation is life. A case can be made quite easily for either Daniel Day-Lewis in ""Gangs of New York"" or Jack Nicholson in ""About Schmidt"" to have taken home the Best Actor Oscar instead, but that is in the past now (it is better not to go into Brody's acceptance speech at all). Also Brody did very little playing of the piano himself (he had a double for the much more difficult pieces) which pales him to past Oscar winners like Holly Hunter (""The Piano"") and Geoffrey Rush (""Shine""). Overall I do think ""The Pianist"" is an excellent film. I do think it is one of the stronger screenplay- and direction-driven films of recent memory. Polanski ends up being the real star here and it is his vision, tone, ability and film-making skill that does make ""The Pianist"" one of the best movies of 2002. 5 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Hard watch but beautiful story,"Adrien Brody does a stellar job in this World War Two film. It tells of a Jewish pianist who finds himself under siege by Nazis and struggling to survive amidst the apocalyptic situation he finds himself in. The film is beautifully shot, written and acted. There's some very hard scenes to watch, inherent of these kinds of films. There's very sudden and unexpected violence. You'll see some pretty helpless moments where you just want to reach into the screen and intervene. The film could be triggering for some, particularly those who are Holocaust survivors. But that's just a testament to how expertly done the film is.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
I love it!,"One of the most exceptional movies about the Holocaust, The Pianist, features an outstanding performance by Adrien Brody, whose nuanced and gaunt portrayal left me speechless and still does so. The movie's impressive set design and passionately acted extras showcase the brutal sufferings of innocent lives in a powerful and purposeful way without resorting to cheap thrills for the audience.Wladyslaw Szpilman was not a hero or a fighter but a survivor whose salvation depended solely on luck. The film's believability and realism stem from its ability to convey this truth. Although the movie can be emotionally draining and heartbreaking, it is worth the sacrifice. The story of the talented Polish pianist is inspiring and serves as a reminder of the resilience of the human spirit.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
"The Pianist may not be a perfect film, but it's easily one of the most powerful movies I've ever seen.","The best thing about The Pianist is a few key moments, which are, in my opinion, some of the most powerful, and best scenes of all time. Some of the images shown here, and what they imply, are just so incredibly horrific and depressing that I can't get them out of my head. This is not only because of what they're actually showing, but also because of the very realistic and grounded way they're presented; most are captured in a single long take and a lot of these sequences aren't shown in detail as they're shot from a distance. At times absolutely nothing is even shown, and instead a single sound effect can be incredibly powerful.Despite a few specific key moments standing out, that's not to say that the rest of the runtime is uninteresting. The plot is unpredictable at every turn and the script isn't afraid to kill off lead characters. There are also many moments with absolutely no dialogue and complete silence were the minor mannerisms in the characters carry the scene, which is elevated by the absolutely excellent performances. The story takes place over a long period of time and the protagonist ends up in many different locations; the way in which he ends up in all these areas though, is very rarely shown. He'll often be somewhere, for example a concentration camp, planning to escape, then the scene would immediately cut to him outside of it, not telling you how he got there until a few minutes later when it's mentioned in a conversation. This is a very unique way to pace a film, and it mostly pays off; I really like that you have to play close attention to follow every plot point and that the script doesn't hold your hand or spoon-feed you. On the other hand however, this does mean that some elements of the story do end up feeling a bit rushed and underdeveloped in the second half as some plot points go by so quickly that it's hard to get attached to them. It is definitely impressive though that despite this film being an entire two and a half hours long, my biggest issue with it is that I wanted it to be longer, as it's really never boring.Roman Polanski may not be the best person, at all, but his work on this film is undeniably excellent. There are plenty of extremely impressive long takes and the direction is fantastic, managing to change from a close up, to a wide, to an over the shoulder in a single shot, without you even realizing. The cinematography really makes you feel as trapped as the lead character and the production and costume design are also absolutely flawless, perfectly presenting the time period. The choice to barely use any music throughout the entire runtime built tension very well and stopped any scene from becoming overly melodramatic. The technical aspects of this film are mostly stellar, the only two exceptions being one otherwise amazing scene with somewhat cheesy sound effects and a very strong overabundance of fade to black transitions, which got really annoying after a while.Overall, The Pianist has some of the best scenes in film history and, despite a few flaws, is one of the most powerful movies I've ever seen.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
The Pianist,"The natures of a Pianist, are more vivid In this society than thought to be known.

One thing that can definitely be grasped by watching this film, is that although a strong, emotional and confident film.

Warsaw Concerto,"Despite the title Adrien Brody doesn't actually get to play the piano much during this film depicting the monstrous institutionalised bullying on an industrial scale that characterised the German occupation of Poland. The second half of the film also largely abandons dialogue for sound effects (what dialogue there is is in German).Growing steadily more gaunt and dishevelled Brody staggers through a Warsaw transformed into a ghost town scattered with corpses while subject to the casual brutality of uniformed thugs who plainly regard it all as a bit of a lark and coping with the hostility of native anti-semites.Director Polanski (90 next August) keeps on going from strength to strength. Originally an actor in the war films of Andrzej Wadja, here he finally addresses head-on the childhood traumas in occupied Poland which obviously lay behind his other films (like Brody the young Polanski was used for target practise by Nazis.When they finally appear the Russians actually get pretty short shift, and considering their recent activities in Ukraine, the observation about the Poles that ""No one thought they'd hold out so long!"" must currently be giving Putin sleepless nights.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
The Pianist,"Follows a Jewish pianist (Brody) trying to survive in the Warsaw ghetto during WW2.A film broadly of 2 parts, the first covering the arrival of the nazis and its impact on the Jewish community most particularly Brody and his family. This is full of tension brought about the German atrocities and as the family descends further and further into hell. In many ways this is the most harrowing part of the film in that there are so many vulnerable family members to worry about as they move from disbelief and outrage to fear and some form of resignation.The bulk of the film though is a slow but fairly tense passage following Brody hiding and surviving alone in the empty ghetto, his life without food and warmth punctuated by moments of terror.The film is tense and like Schindler's List you do have this dreadful sense throughout of disbelief that this could have happened by people to people. Brody is very good in the lead and overall it is a considerable achievement - important to be sure. I just found that some passages took long to make their point - sorry.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Disappointed,"I went to see this movie with pretty high expectations. Polanski has quite a reputation. I felt the film was dull, lacked artistic imagination and its trite presentation of history really disappointing. Apart from the scene with the suitcases, I found the whole thing banal, way too heavy handed and very clichéd. If you are interested in the subject of the film, I recommend you read the following couple of pages from a memoir of the son of a Holocaust survivor at the web address below. In the five minutes you will take to read it you will learn more about this period of history than in the three hours of watching this excruciatingly dreary film. http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg=18&ar=1",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Far from cheerful viewing but an impacting and engaging film that helps keep history relevant,"Wladyslaw Szpilman is a musician living with his family in 1930's Warsaw. The rise of anti-Semitism starts to erode their civil liberties, making them have permits to work, requiring them to wear armbands that identify them as Jewish and generally treating them like second-class citizens and lesser people. This gradual slide becomes increasingly serious as all Jews are ordered into one small area of the city, where whole families are given flats with one or two small rooms to be shared among six or seven people. As the murders and control of the Jews continue, Szpilman is left to try and survive while the war rages across Europe.I didn't bother to watch this in the cinema despite the Oscars and rave reviews simply because I could never get my head in the right space to spend my time on a subject that was never going to be an easy watch. With it coming onto television recently though I decided it was worth a look and easily got into it, which the emotional power of the story doing enough to carry it along for the duration. At times it does feel like watching war porn, as Polanski wheels out one more shocking atrocity after another and occasionally feels like he is involved in a game of one-upmanship with other Holocaust movies (so we don't just have a man thrown out a window, but a disabled old man thrown out a window). This was a bit of a problem for me because I wanted more to the film that just the horror shown to me. However the film does do more than that and generally does enough to be as impacting in the study of Szpilman as it is in just yet again reminding us of the terrible things done in Europe barely 60 years ago.On both levels the film works while never being something you should try and watch expecting it to be a fun night in. Staying away from the front line of the war, the film focuses on the effects on the innocent, specifically Szpilman, who struggles to just stay alive. Up till this point the film had been a bit obvious, with bad things happening while the Szpilman's argue over what to do etc, with the film relying heavily on the shock and horror of what was happening. The rest of the film is more about him being left alone and hidden within Warsaw, which although slow is still impacting and engaging. At this point Brody also steps up and becomes much better than before, showing so much with just a horrified look but still containing enough of a character to be more than just our eyes. The rest of the cast are all good but generally it is Brody that carries the majority of the film. Polanski directs with a very good eye for the breakdown of this world and it looks totally of period and convincing.Overall then, not a film to come to if you are hoping for a cheerful night in but one to watch to gain a wider appreciation of the atrocities that can so easily be allowed to take place. Ethnic cleansing and wars continue even as I sit writing these words so those that think this film is just an unnecessary wallow in past horrors would do well to take a minute and think. At times it could have been better but it is impossible to ignore the power of the story and the impact of the delivery.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

"Amazing, vivid and unforgettable Movie!","What a fabulous movie! Very very touching and realistic. One of Adolf Hitler's first major foreign policy initiatives after coming to power was to sign a nonaggression pact with Poland in January 1934. Poland had received the former German provinces of West Prussia, Poznan, and Upper Silesia under the Treaty of Versailles after World War I. Britain and France deployed their force in poland. However, neither Britain nor France in 1938 was militarily prepared to fight a war against Nazi Germany.During that time, people were in exigency and crisis. This film shows that exact situation. People were inconsequential. I saw how people endured the situation, how they were killed by Nazies .Certainly I'm going to give this credit to Roman Polanski and Ronald Harwood for making this film so realistic. Haven't seen such a worst situation before this. What is crisis? You will come to know after watching this film. This film shows exactly how it was in real.A poor hungry old man threw a bowl of food from being eaten by a poor woman. The poor old man licked the road in order to eat the food that came out of the bowl. The man was deranged though. This one is my best part of this movie. Another best part is, a young boy was selling caramel for 20 zlotys. A caramel for 20 zlotys! Can you believe this? Situation materialized it. Wladyslaw's father intended to buy a caramel. However, he had only 10 zlotys. So he collected other 10 from others around him. Worse part is, he divided the caramel into 6 pieces and distributed to other members of his family. Very very pathetic and regretful. There are so many tremendous moments that touched my heart but I can't mention them all simultaneously.I'm impressed seeing the survive of Wladyslaw.Every film doesn't have a great ending, nevertheless this film has a great ending! Of course the Nazies were vanquished in the end.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
"A very good war film that centers on the brutalities and travails of war, but lacks the ambition of a genre masterpiece.","A very good war film that depicts the throes of war to a tee, but lacking the nuance that is evident in Spielberg or Cauron's works. Polanski seemed to opt for a less realistic approach in directing this movie, and characters seem more aware that they are in a film than in Schindler's List or Children of Men. In other words, despite the direction being incredibly deft and skillful, it can feel stiff at certain points of the film, and the set pieces artificial and unnatural. The pacing is very well done here, but the fast pace bereaves time for character building. As a result, despite the plethora of violence and moments of despair, they don't land as hard on an emotional level. The side characters/victims are not fleshed out enough, and there's a feel of spectacle for spectacle sake, where scenes play out for an overt intention to fish out visceral reactions. Without ample build up, I find it rather void. There are also quite a few plot contrivances in the film, which point to its main goal of achieving mainstream appeal. The story is decent, and I do not consider it a weak asset despite how simple it is. The protagonist's journey is wild and gripping, but it is not consistently interesting enough to considered very memorable - there aren't quite enough iconic moments or sequences that leaves a profound mark. The reaction between two certain characters at the end of the film could have used a bit more development, especially for one person whom we only come across at the end of the film; a better approach would be to do a dual/ interspersing narrative to introduce that character before that critical scene, such that it holds more weight. Speaking of characters, I feel like there are not enough bad important characters in the film, as opposed to a few good ones that exist. Perhaps it is intentional, with which the film conveys the message that warfare itself is the evil menace while humanity is inherently kind. Still, if there is more contrast presented in certain individuals, those ""noble"" characters would make a bigger impact in both the story and the audience, since it would accentuate the film's ""message"". Lastly, the film's core theme isn't entirely new either. I don't see any new ideas presented in the film other than the cruelty of war, and the struggles of suppressed ethnic groups under tyranny. The protagonist is a lovable character, carried by an amazing performance by Brody, but it is also rather one dimensional that sees little character growth by the end of the film. The Pianist is after all a standard war film, a very well rounded, crowd-pleasing one at that, or at least it feels like one. It does not seem to try achieve much more beyond that.As for the positive aspects, there isn't much that people haven't said already. The cinematography is fantastic, especially the scenes filmed at night. Brody's performance is electrifying and pretty much carries the whole movie. Like I said, the pacing is very well done, and although I find the first hour of the film rather dull, it never feels like it drags at any point, thanks to Polanski's expert direction. The wide appeal of the film means that it is a good recommendation for people who are new to war films. Overall, I don't think it is a 10/10 masterpiece that many hyped it up to be. I think Schindler's List and Children of Men are both far superior films. Yet, it certainly is an enjoyable experience if you are looking for a more palatable war film (there is a fair bit of violence though, so I wouldn't consider it too family friendly).",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
The Worst Pseudo-Playing Ever!,"How did Adrien Brody win best actor when he couldn't even convincingly ""fake play"" the piano? Every time he sat down at the piano, I rolled my eyes and felt so embarrassed for him: here goes again the utterly ridiculous head sways and the faulty positioning of the hands on the keyboard! The scene in which he plays for the Nazi guy was the most hilarious: The Nazi is supposed to be ""inspired"" and ""touched"" by his playing, but because Brody looks so awful, all one can think about is how truly awful it must have sounded while filming; there was no suspension of disbelief.

Another thing I noticed, and liked, in the film is that some Nazis (specially Captain Hosenfeld) were presented in a positive way that I have not seen in any movie about the WW2 before, it just proves that some of them contained humanity. Also, needless to say but I will say it anyway, the acting game was at a spectacular level.

A similar ground in different sides...,"Had to be top achievement of Adrien Brody, and I never doubt the pinnacle of his performance for this. Set again the old ages of the 20th century this film made me recall Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" ringing in my head. It was as heartrending, fearful, expressive and disastrous as the characters of Spielberg's film experienced, though in a different view of course. This film again showed us the misery of innocent people experienced in the hands of vile Germany. But then it left me a room to think in my head that not everything of Germany is as vile as the mainstream thinks. It's the same lesson I picked when watching Schindler's List. And the suffering of the protagonist opened once more parts of life you never thought would happen to anyone. And there are so many things you would never thought of letting go or letting it happen before your eyes and conscience. Such burden and misfortune one has to carry just to survive, Adrien's character lived up to that. We saw it, the struggle and transformation. It was the beauty this film carried, no wonder that for me an Oscar is not ample enough to appreciate the brilliance of human experience excellently told to the mass.Funny it is when my brother's girlfriend recommended me this film and after watching it, I can't get over it. I was even impressed to myself when I shared it to my officemate that she told me how vivid my recollections where. I can't explain it, but probably because of my craving for a beautiful story made me grasp the film in just one go. Just like ""Joyeux Noel"" an opposite of this film, though with same worldly issues and situations, strengthened my attachment to them.There so much to tell about this film and I'm really looking forward for the book the film is based.

It distinguishes itself from Polanski's other masterpieces because it has the heart his films usually do not possess.

Polanski's Most Personal Film,"If I'm being honest, I think Polanski winning the best director Oscar for this film is sort of like Scorsese winning his Oscar for ""The Departed""; both awards feel a bit like consolation Oscars. What do I mean by that? Well, I don't believe that this is the best film Polanski has put out; in fact, I wouldn't even put it in his top three. It is a good film, however, and with all the amazing movies that Polanski produced during his career I'm glad that he found a bit of recognition, even if it is for a film that isn't as polished as some of his others.Polanski himself said that his was the most personal film he's ever made, and there's good reason for that. Polanski was in his preteens when WWII washed over Poland, and he, like Wladyslaw Szpilman, survived the ghettos while their families were less fortunate (Polanski's mother was killed in Auschwitz). ""The Pianist"" shows a side of the holocaust that we rarely see, for it's not from the perspective of the camps which we see most of the film, but from the perspective of one who has escaped the camps and is still forced to live in a prison of isolation and degradation.As a whole, I think the story told in this movie is wonderful, and since it is based on a true story, it's hard to criticize it too much for structure, but at the same time, I do feel that this movie starts to drag in the second act. Most of the truly disturbing stuff happens in the first half of this film. The parts where Szpilman is separated from his family, the purging of the ghetto, the moving to concentration camps... all of that stuff happens within the first hour and fifteen minutes, and the last hour of this movie is mostly focused on Szpilman trying to stay quiet in apartments, trying to figure out what's gong on outside, and struggling to get over sickness. By no means does the story ever get boring- it's still fascinating, but the horrors of the first half of this movie are far more memorable than those in the second half.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Fantastic,"A very depressing and emotionally draining experince and it works incredibly well for the movie. Every actor does a fantastic job with the main actor pulling of one of the best acting performences of all time. The constume and setting design is perfect and that pared with the acting makes it very easy to get invested and sucked into the setting. The colour pallet changing depending on the state of warsaw and the weather was a subtle addition but added a lot to the experience. The Music was great to.Now im not sure if the story in this movie about the pianist himself was entirly 100% accurate, I think it probably very accurate but I thought the same thing for schindlers list but apperantly it was actually pretty unaccurate of the portrail of Oskar Schindler.

The true emotion of war,"Among the many world war movies and series, ""The Pianist"" definitely stands out in an extraordinary position. It was hard for me to watch in the first hour due to the raw natural emotional nature it showcased. This movie did a superb job in making the viewer grasp the feeling of anxiousness, fear, the unpredictable nature of the world war and the immense brutality the people faced. There were so many emotional scenes. The fact it had many silent time slots, did a great job in showcasing the emptiness and dullness to the viewer.

"Okay, but stands under the constant shadow of ""Schindler's List,"" and is even more unabashedly sentimental","Although I found ""The Pianist"" to be a commendable and fairly well-made effort, I did not find it to be a masterpiece. It certainly has the ""feel"" of an epic but compared to other WWII/Jewish movies (particularly ""Schindler's List"") it fails.I was shocked to see that the film had generated some fairly bad reviews on RottenTomatoes.com. I can understand where these authors are coming from -- ""The Pianist"" is a fine movie but uneven and not as great as it seems to think it is.At best I can compliment the good parts because some of them really are touching, but more often than not it's just too purposely sentimental to warm up to -- I never thought I'd say this but even Spielberg's version was less sugar-coated!Don't get me wrong, it's not glamorized and there are some brutal deaths, but it's just a bit too black-and-white and emotionally controlling for me to call it a masterpiece.3/5",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

powerful,"This is going to be a difficult review as difficult and disturbing the movie ""The Pianist"" was. Even though our world is saturated with crime and violence I still had close my eyes for some of the scenes in this movie. At one point I thought that it was too much. I have seen many, many movies about the WW2, but a have never seen violence in such a blunt way. One has to be in a lot of pain to be able to make such a movie, which is pretty much the case with Mr. Polanski.The movie tells the true story of a man who survives the holocaust by pure chance, luck, stoicism, and the good will of few good people. Or maybe everything was just a fate. Don't expect to see a hero or fighter kind of story. No, he is just a man fighting for his own survival. This is not a thriller.I knew that there would be a scene where the pianist is supposed to play for a German solder so I was looking forward to seeing it. I wanted to see the direction of the scene, the acting of them both (the pianist and the officer), and of course, hear the music. Well, it was a breathtaking experience. See it for yourselfP.S. At the end I think that the Russians a very much in debt to that genre-movies dealing with the WW2. They used to make such a great movies about the war, but not anymore. I think it is about time to see a high budget Russian WW2 movie, a film about those who carried out the entire war on their shoulders.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

My rating: 9,"The piano which is my favorite musical instrument. After is the violin and the sax. Which is second I can not say. Music – a form of freedom, playing music – of liberation, composing music – special case of the creationist providence.Away from the fact that I saw this movie long time ago I probably will never forget it. A chased piano player in the contrast of the war and the ruined buildings is an image of contradiction which dives in the mind and lay there for a a very long time. The only one ability of man to succeed in expressing and protecting him is something very special. And what if the circumstances are force marjorie? Is it creativity the only one string deep in us that love is pulling to sing its humble messages?Really wonderful movie but not for everyone.

Very hard to watch film, especialy for more sensitive people.

Polansky has embraced the neo-noir style more than any other modern director and it's poignancy has resulted in the pinnacle film of his career. Polansky also relies on the actors to instruct the audience as to what is important and why.

Very gripping,"I had the DVD of this film for over 3 years and never watched it, because I never really had the time in between my hectic schedule to watch this film, but when I did read the reviews of the film on IMDb, it grabbed me so much that I finally decided to watch this film at mid-night (after my entire days schedule). I must say that it was WORTH every minute (late at night).Every single actor in the film had a realism in their character which is very uncommon in many international films. It seems that the director 'made sure' that the film grabs you inside the TV/Screen and puts the viewer in the space and time of Warsaw massacre. Having said this, the props were well selected and felt real.The story telling and the chronology was well synchronized along side the classical composition of Szpilman.This film is not about the Holocaust but about one man and his will to survive the evil that prevailed during the times of Hitler. This film also goes to show 'why should an innocent Jew suffer from the higher level of political war that prevails on this earth'. He just want's to be left alone and continue with his normal life. He has nothing to do with the war, but with his survival and his life. ""Why should he die, if he is not guilty"".In conclusion, this film conveys a message to all of us that we do not need to fight with opponent to win anything, but we need to find way's out of the trouble and war that has 'nothing to do with us'. This is a lesson we must all learn from this film.I am proud of Szpilman and many more who followed his footsteps, because they are the real winners of the war.MUST SEE THIS FILM.My score: 8 out of 10Regards, Neil Bhatia",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
"""The Pianist"" exudes authenticity","It's a Warsaw Ghetto World War II survivor biopic of Wladyslaw Szpilman set from 1939 to 1945. The film begins with 28-year-old Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) playing live on Warsaw radio in September 1939 when the German invasion begins. He is already well-known in Polish cultural circles. We meet Szpilman's family; he appears to be the oldest child. Wladyslaw is somewhat aloof; his brother Henryk (Ed Stoppard) is much more politically aggressive. His parents, Samuel (Frank Finlay) and Edwarda (Maureen Lipman), are upper class and hardly know how to respond.""The Pianist"" follows Szpilman's pivotal experiences over the next six years. The family first lives in the ""Little"" part of the Warsaw Ghetto. Szpilman is separated from his family and becomes a slave laborer before escaping the ghetto and living with the help of non-Jewish friends in increasingly difficult circumstances. In the last months of 1944, he is even saved by a German officer (Thomas Kretschmann) who learns Szpilman is a skilled pianist.What is remarkable about ""The Pianist"" is that it does not portray Wladyslaw Szpilman as a hero. He is primarily passive and survives on the generosity of others. He sees many heinous atrocities and sometimes tries to help others, but mainly reacts when danger is imminent. ""The Pianist"" exudes authenticity because of this approach.Although I wish Polanski had faced a criminal trial in the United States, he is a brilliant director. The pacing and visuals are excellent. Adrien Brody is superb.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
good movie,"This movie is beautifully shot and features some great acting. It has a nice mix of romance, drama and action scenes. The piano music fits the story nicely. I could not help but compare ThePianist to Schindler'sList, which i think is slightly better, as it has a more complete plot. ThePianist's plot is a bit thin; we get to see how the Jewish Pianist experiences the war years in Poland, chronologically. There's only a very thin connection between the things that happen and the fact that he's a pianist, which imho is not so satisfactory.Don't get me wrong; it's a good, sad, movie: see it if you can.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

Writhing In The Mud And Coming Up Clean,"The Pianist is a great film and shares a similar space with Schindler's List in war movies. Adrien Brody does a great job in expressing the struggles of losing loved ones/friends to undeserved violence and living in poor quality conditions, with his body deteriorating as the war continued. The supporting actors are great as well and really tie up the family unit nicely. It is their great portrayals that make it all the more depressing when they are stripped from him and he is thrust into minimal contact of any value. My favorite aspect of the film would have to be the sets. They are well crafted and create a gloomy and hollow atmosphere that starts with warm colors but fade into cool tones. I also think the sets have a slight ""theater/play"" aesthetic that makes it distinct from other war films. This film is a testament to enduring the harsh hands of man and unfair choices but ends in the warmth of a new life. This film makes for a wonderful headstone of a man that has deserved his day of play.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

Never again,"Soundtrack for this review: El pianista del gueto de Varsovia by Jorge DrexlerIt is hard to review this movie. It is not easy to evaluate this movie in terms of its acting, its quality, its directing, with an armchair attitude that ignores the crudeness and harshness of real life. It is hard to say phrases like ""Roman Polanski, perhaps due to its own experience, captures perfectly the feeling of everyday life of Polish Jews during the Second World War, its sadness and despair but also the tiny moments of hope"", however true that might be.It is very hard to rate this just as a movie, and not as a reminder for the human race of what are we capable of. I'm often reluctant to watch Holocaust movies because I know beforehand that they will have very hard to digest moments, and they are almost an act of masochism, two hours of intense suffering. But they are necessary, they are real stories that urge to be told, and need to be heard so that they don't happen again.In a world where islamophobic parties are winning votes in Europe, where Americans proudly wave a flag that is the symbol of slavery in front of their president, these movies are indispensable. We cannot allow ourselves to fall into the collective madness that Germany fell into between 1933 and 1945. We should have learnt by now that technology has allowed the State to mobilize way too many resources, and the extermination of an entire group of people is only a button away. Not to mention the fact that these things still happen in more remote corners of the world, where they don't destabilize global geopolitics.So it would be too frivolous from my side to evaluate Polanski's direction or Brody's acting, as if this was fiction. The feeling I have after having watched The Pianist is not the one of a film critic that passively observes reality from behind his desk, but an active one, the imperative of making sure that nothing like this ever happens again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

"""The Pianist"" is a brilliant composition with Polanski as the virtuoso composer","""The Pianist"" is a film that is impossible to dislike. In fact, it may be impossible to love it as well. It's a traumatic and difficult biographical account of one of the many unbelievable Holocaust survival stories. What makes ""Pianist"" stand out, however is the traumatic realism, the way that the story evolves to strike an emotional chord in regards to the Nazi's crimes and the unique role of music in the film.""The Pianist"" is the Oscar-winning best adapted screenplay from the autobiography of Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody), an accomplished Jewish pianist in Warsaw right as World War II strikes. The film plays out as several scenes following a timeline from the initial invasion to the Warsaw ghetto to Szpilman's many hideouts in the city throughout the war. While the true sense of time is skewed and thus the true agony of Szpilman's isolation unrealized, the timeline clearly shows how the Jews and everyone in Warsaw for that matter had their lives transformed.What makes this film so effective is the way Oscar winners Ronald Harwood (screenplay), but mostly director Roman Polanski, go right for your heartstrings. The Nazis are portrayed as cold-blooded killers. There is no emotional build-up or excessive suspense in the film's violent moments. It is sudden and mechanical, leaving you wondering how anyone could do such a thing, when the fact of the matter was that's exactly how it happened: many times arbitrary, heartless killing. The whole effect that Polanski has created with the violence being viewed by Szpilman and his family through windows, isolated from the mêlée, is very effective in the way that it connects with how the viewer is very much isolated from the true nature of the violence. Polanski conditions you to be afraid every time Szpilman looks out the window that violence might occur, which is exactly what Szpilman was: very curious about what was going on, but truly afraid. The effect is brilliant.The films third Oscar winner, Brody, doesn't give an emotionally moving performance per say, but his performance is award-worthy in its realism through exquisite use of non-verbal skills and his natural demeanor. You can tell how the war has transformed him as a person through each stage--from day one to the final moments of the film.If there's a weakness to the film, it's the fact that it doesn't spend enough time grasping Szpilman as a pianist. There is no sense as to how important his playing is or why he plays. Instead, the focus is more on the unfolding the events of WWII. While the idea the film presents of him being a pianist simply because that's what he knows to do is effective towards the end, a greater understanding of what playing the piano means to him would have been ideal in the beginning.""The Pianist"" is a tremendous achievement in terms of successfully telling a often repeated story in a way that is uniquely effective. It focuses on the aspect of the Holocaust that speaks to perseverance, basic survival in a life of fear that plays out outside your window. It is a tough film, but it's a good one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Adagio,"Heavy subject matter frightens people. Few dared say an unkind word about Philadelphia (AIDS!) when it first came out, regardless of the fact that it was dreadful. Folks seem similarly reluctant to find fault with The Pianist (The Holocaust!), though it's a far superior film.Being a survivor himself, Polanski is to be applauded for his clear-eyed depiction of life and death in the Jewish ghetto, but his matter-of-factness had a curiously distancing effect on me. I felt uninvolved. It was also a brave move to omit subtitles from the German dialogue, but getting the gist of what is being said is not the same as understanding and once more I felt left out.Further, many of the events leading to changes in Szpilman's situation remain unclear. On other occasions, Polanski labours his point and I just wanted him to move on to the next episode. He's a very good director, but he won the Oscar amidst a very weak field (and I include Scorsese's work on Gangs Of New York) - remember that this is the same body of people that anointed Ron Howard 'best director' a year previously.Impressive at times, but uneven and occasionally sluggish and frustrating.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

This is rather unique for Holocaust films since most Holocaust films take place within the concentration camps, but this film doesn't have a single scene in one.Adrien Brody's performance is genuinely one of the best I've ever seen, seeing his body deteriorate on screen is difficult to watch as he struggles to survive, but makes it all the more immersive. The production design and sets are perfect in my opinion and also play a huge role in immersing the audience, I really felt as if I was in the heart of Nazi Germany watching this film. The direction and cinematography might be boring for some but I really loved Polanski's use of perspective in this film, many shots are set up from the perspective of Szpilman looking out his apartment window as gunfights occur down on the streets which I thought was a great artistic choice.I can't recommend this film enough, it's a must watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

Of course, director Roman Polanski is the sustaining unrelenting force throughout the entire 2 hrs. 28 mins. filmic journey. (In his interview with Charlie Rose on PBS, Brody mentioned that he was expected to lose 30 lbs. in weight to inhabit the lead role's emaciating period, besides prompted to diligently play Chopin on the piano for 6 months, 6 days a week.)This is much more than just another Holocaust movie (neither ""Schindler's List"" or ""Sophie's Choice""). It's Polanski's own: he gave the film quite an emotionally restrained treatment, almost felt like a documentary with doses of stark photography, not without hints of poetry at times. Have patience, there is action, suspense, and you shall be rewarded towards last part of the film, with teardrops for sure. Actually, occasional smiles and a chuckle were afforded. It is taut human drama complete - even though we know of the outcome, we still worry and startle, relieve and sigh along with Brody's character at his brush with danger throughout the film. The audience is very much in the first person alone and lonely with Szpilman on the screen. And when joy arrives, it's truly touching.The story is based on Szpilman's book (written 4 years after the war) with screenplay by Ronald Harwood (Cry the Beloved Country 1995, Mandela - TV 1987, The Dresser 1983.) The soundtrack included many Frédéric Chopin (1810-1849) piano pieces: Nocturne, Ballade, Prelude, Waltz, Polonaise and Mazurka. Wojciech Kilar provided additional music, and Hervé de Luze on film editing - both have collaborated on Polanski's ""Ninth Gate, The"" 1999, and ""Death and the Maiden"" 1994. Cinematography by Pawel Edelman, who was in many film projects by Polish writer-director Andrzej Wajda. Production designer Allan Starski and costume designer Anna Sheppard were involved in Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" 1993. It's worthwhile to visit the official Web site:  Kudos to everyone involved on this project - such integrity and strength, and to R.P.

"Well done, but...","""The Pianist"" is a good movie in every way - acting, photography, directing, whatever. But in the end it is just another Holocaust movie. Tormented Jews, German cruelties, a kind Nazi, all the usual stuff. It breaks no new ground, offers no new insights.

"Hope, miracle, a silhouette","A movie about survive. In dark nuances, with Shoah as scene, in the steps of gorgeous images, a story. A pianist, few miracles and music. A long trip in a large desert.

And it is a Polanski in which Adrien Brody is brilliant. For the art to discover each color of silent fight. For the strange occasions in which death is expected answer. But the final is a town in ruin, a Nazi officer and a piano. A kind of gift as birth of new time.

Morally ambiguous,"Seeing the Pianist movie really bothered me, partly because 10 years after Schindler's List, it seems like so much less of a movie.  It's not groundbreaking.  The production quality isn't better.  The leading man acts with a deer-in-headlights expression.But I was mostly bothered by the anti-hero Szpilman.  He's a selfish person, concerned only with his own survival.  Other people give him a lot of assistance, not because he deserves it, but because he's talented.  Is this good?  I don't know.  It seems good that the people of Poland risked and sacrificed much to protect a gifted musician through the Holocaust.  But I don't find Szpilman likable.  Especially after reading ""1952"" at the close of the movie -- I just wanted to bop him in the nose what a jerk.It also bothers me that Hollywood -- or rather, the Academy -- seems to overreward piano playing characters.

His love of music, and not being able to play personally touches the audience. As music is his life and passion, not exercising that talent only drives sorrow to the extreme-degree.

Brilliant and very touching movie,"This movie is really excellent! Some people here on imdb said, that it's the best movie about the Holocaust, and I have to agree, at least considering all the movies I know. Schindler's List is surely a very good movie, and Spielberg was in my opinion very careful and not very Hollywood-like when handling the topic. But this one seemed to reach a bit deeper.The best scene for me was when Szpilman played for the nazi captain. I don't want to try to find some explanation or so, but this was really ... what it's about to be a human, and what you can't take away by all this cruelness. Some friends said, they found the movie depressing, but I think it's quite the opposite.Some remarks on the reception here in Germany: all the reviews were very good, the cinema I went to was sold out, and the audience obviously was very touched by the movie, staying in their seats until the very end of the closing credits. Unfortunatly, it seems like The Pianist is by far not getting the media attention that Schindler's List had some years ago. So, I assume there will be far less people seeing that movie, though I think it's the better one ...",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
"well done, even if it didn't quite equal ""Schindler's List""","In what I assume was Roman Polanski's most personal movie ever, he tells the story of Polish-Jewish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) doing everything possible to survive the Nazi occupation. As is the case with all of Polanski's movies, there are some very harrowing scenes, namely when the Nazi planes first start bombing the city, and when Szpilman has to hide. As Szpilman, Brody really brings out the most in the character (no doubt his sad face helps with that).I will say that the movie doesn't quite equal the profundity achieved by ""Schindler's List"". But maybe that's not a fair comparison, since Polanski probably wasn't aiming for that.

It's like my own personal experience when facing stress, hiding myself in a physiological or physical safe corner, facing the temptation to live like this for the rest of my life, and finally force myself to get out to face the outside world.

"Fantastic, Roman Polanski beats Steven Spielberg","""The Pianist"" is one of the best movies i've ever seen. After seeing the ""Ninth gate"" i didn't expect much of Roman Polanski, but the pianist is truly great and should certainly be on your ""movies-to-watch-list"". The movie has it's gentle parts in which the main character Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) plays Chopin. But it also shows the horrors of the second world war. While Szpilman tries to save himself people around him are being killed and starved to death in the Warsaw ghetto, including his family. Adrien Brody, by the way, performs absolutely brilliant. Polanski confronts war, suffering, despair, hope and the choices of Wladyslaw Szpilman, which are based on the book and life of Szpilman, in this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Beautiful film but OH! - so very hard to watch,"I wanted to see this film when it in the cinemas - but thought it might be difficult to watch.When the DVD was released, I bought it but still found reasons to leave it till later.Finally I viewed it in two halves. It is a magnificent piece of work - desperately sad, perfectly acted and made with infinite care.It is profoundly unsettling to ponder on the behaviour of humankind. Why are some capable of such monstrous inhumanity while others behave with unbelievable selflessness to total strangers in need?The few reviewers who thought this film lacked action and was boring, can I respectfully suggest they stick to less demanding fare in which no thought process is required at all.For others who have not yet seen this film - please do so - but be prepared to be very moved by it.Adrien Brody will surely never surpass his brilliant performance in the role of Wladyslaw Szpilman. Roman Polanski has made the movie of his career. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
absolutely stunning,"Polanski, unlike any other filmmaker, has a way of getting into your very core and evoking unconcsious emotions that seem to manifest themselves for days after. The Pianist is the type of film that initially strikes one as powerful, but perhaps so much so that its core essence requires time to settle and be processed. As several days have passed, I find my focus of attention ever more on the film and the ingenious manner in which it was designed. Really, few words will do the film justice but if I may say visually stunning and existentially powerful, perhaps that may be a meager start. The film is less a story of the main character's nightmarish struggle for survival during the unspeakable occupation of the Nazis in Warsaw; it is a pure visual study of hell observed primarily through the character. My God, how Polanski orchestrates this feat of cinematic power is hard to discern but his consistency in doing so is nothing less than pure genius. From the character's hideaway in an abandoned flat and the brutality of German soldiers always occurring at a distance as a panoramic backdrop to the character is an element I've never really seen done on this type of scale. If I may say Polanski has succeeded in creating a new cinematic dynamic, that wouldn't be an exaggeration. In the present climate of Hollywood silliness and superficiality, The Pianist is a rare achievement that rates it among the best films of all time, if not for its incredible usage of technique, but for its utter message of human evil and the struggle for survival against that evil which we, as the present generation, must always remember and never forget.

An incredibly touching tale of survival,"Divisive director Roman Polanski has had a polarizing career both behind camera and in a personnel sense yet whatever one may feel about the man or the filmmaker there is little doubt that his most effective and most profound movie is 2002's The Pianist. A true life war tale of incredible determination and bravery, Polanski's telling of accomplished Poland pianist and Jew Wladyslaw Szpilman ranks as one of cinemas greatest War set tales thanks to an incredibly realistic feel and a raft of award worthy acting turns.Justifiably winning Polanski a Best Director Oscar, The Pianist sees the veteran director at his highest creative peak, an artist moulding with his material perfectly to create a vividly alive look into the atrocities that faced Warsaw's Jewish community and all others of similar creeds during Hitler's reign of terror. Polanski's Warsaw is brimming with stark images, from bodies strewn in the streets of the Jewish ""ghettos"", snow covered buildings in the harsh reality of a European winter and the strange comforts of an upmarket café as people go hungry outside, it's unquestionable that the setting of The Pianist is a character unto itself and part of the reason the movie works to the extent it does. It's interesting also to note how many a time Polanski films some of the movies most confronting scenes (wheelchair bound elders thrown from windows etc.) from a wide shot perspective, giving us the viewers a feeling of witnessing these events from far, powerless to stop what is happening yet not to the extent of being unaffected by it, much like our protagonist Wladyslaw Szpilman.It would be remiss now with a decade hindsight of Adrien Brody to not remark on the power he displayed here as Szpilman. Brody inhabits Szpilman to an extent you quickly forget it is an actor you are watching, whether he is brave, scared or as time wears on dangerously gaunt, Brody delivers the Oscar winning turn that seemingly set him up for an illustrious career that so far has sadly failed to eventuate. It's impossible to say with full assurance that it's Brody's fault completely that he has failed to get close creatively to what he delivered here in Polanski's effort or if it is filmmakers that have failed him in their material. Whatever the case may be regarding Brody's disappointing post-Pianist career there is no taking away from his ageless performance here in an ensemble that all play their parts to perfection from Frank Finlay as Szpilman's aging father through to Thomas Kretschmann's small but pivotal role as German captain Wilm Hosenfeld.A heartening tale of survival, an indictment of the horrors of war and the evil within humanity, The Pianist is not always an easy watch but it's an important one. A truly stunning tale of the will to survive and a tension filled 2 and a half hours thanks to Polanski's no fuss professional turn behind camera, this is true life based storytelling at its finest and a worthy film to sit alongside other revered War based film classics.5 bits of caramel out of 5For more movie reviews and opinions check out -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
What's not to like about this movie?,"The marketing departments of the different production houses always know how to make a huge hype about a movie. That's why I always try not to see a movie immediately after it gets many international prizes. I don't want to be disappointed because my expectations were just too high.For 'The Pianist' I didn't make an exception and I'm glad I didn't. I just saw it for the first time on DVD and I can only say that this is a true masterpiece. No, not because it got so many awards, neither because Roman Polanski directed it and certainly not because this is a movie about the Jews. I think this is a modern classic and a true masterpiece simply because I was blown away by the story! It shows how the Jews had to live in the ghetto with so many people on so little space, how the Nazi's randomly shot people and humiliated them, but also that not all Germans were such horrible pigs.Roman Polanski made an authentic movie about what happened in the Jewish ghettos and he did an excellent job if you ask me. He didn't portray the war and the Jews the way Spielberg did with Schindler's list. He shows us what happened by following Wvadyslav Szpilman - a young and famous pianist - from the last days before the beginning of the war until the war is over. Don't expect any images from the concentration camps like you saw in Spielberg's movie. The complete story is situated in Warsaw - in the Jewish Ghetto and never leaves it.Roman Polanski did not only create a great visual experience with this movie, it's the music that gives this film an extra and subtle, even poetical touch. There are many scenes of war and destruction, the special effects are very realistic and were never intended to glamorize the movie. Every scene is frightening and realistic, but it is the beautiful classical music that makes all the depicted horrors a little less hard to chew...I can recommend this film to everybody and I'm convinced that every one should see this movie at least once. But I think that the people who are interested in the history of the Jews during the second world war will love this movie the most. I guess that everybody who saw Schindler's list and loved it will love this one as well and I just can't say which one of the two was the best. I rewarded this movie with a 10/10. Don't hesitate to watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Speechless,"This movie left me speechless, but I'll try to write some words down though. ;-)I'm quite a picky person when it comes to cinema, and I -almost- always find something to criticize, except for a very little group of movies (this far, 8 movies out of 600+ that I've seen..) that I found flawless. ""The Pianist"" is among them. You don't say.I knew that Polanski is a great filmmaker, for sure, but I'd never expected him to take the whole thing so seriously, putting SO MUCH dedication into creating such a fine piece of art.Polanski has avoided all of the traps common to movies in its genre (the first one coming to one's mind being ""Schindler's list, though to me those are very different movies), and chose to make no compromise at all. No heroism, no cheap emotionally manipulative scenes, no off ""dramatic"" music, nothing to try to grasp the attention of the immature modern film viewer. He decided to make ART, and more than that, he decided to do that with such a heart, and such dignity, that even without the truly mind-blowing filming savoir-faire he used in ""The Pianist"", the movie would have been excellent. But he obviously wanted more, doing his best to serve the story told. I guess he's been preparing this movie with great care, and for a long time.Polanski has set, with ""The Pianist"", a new standard in cinematic excellence. The use of the camera eye is the best I've seen so far since ""2001"" and ""Barry Lyndon"", and goes even further than these movies in its ability to create a sense of ""being there"". Kubrick left this path for further movies, exploring different (and most of the time very interesting) possibilities. Cronenberg shows the same kind of ability sometimes, but he's focused on a very different aspect of the human's mind (that's the least to say).The focus here is more timeless, it's difficult to put into words, I mean it's not possible to actually EXPLAIN what Polanski has achieved with ""The Pianist"" unless, maybe, someone very talented writes a whole book about it *LOL*. No, this is art, pure art, and relies on the honesty, humanity and total dedication of a *human being*, who just happens to be one of the best filmmakers around. What the film does, that ""2001"" did not, is telling a straight story. It had to, considering the humanist goal. But it also creates this beautiful cinematic poetry, powerfully evocative, that was the signature of ""2001"" and ""Barry Lyndon"", and more recently of Lynch's -more ""arty""- ""Mullholland drive"". I'd say that ""The Pianist"" reconciles humanist storytelling with cinematic audiovisual poetry, in a way that will be very difficult to outmatch.Maybe that the problem of the movie, which I don't consider as a flaw, is that in the context of modern cinema, ""The Pianist"" may seem weak and flat to the fast movies young addicts created by the movie industry. Those will find in ""Schindler's list"" a more familiar tone, where heroism and human values are portrayed in the Hollywood manipulative fashion that Spielberg masters oh so well. It's a pity, as ""The Pianist"" is a far more authentic and honest work than anything Spielberg will ever be able to achieve. Polanski doesn't want to manipulate us in any way in ""The Pianist"" (though he showed in the past that he's very good with cinematic manipulative tools, think about ""Rosemary's baby""!!), he wants - IMO - to offer us an opportunity to make our own journey through the events shown, leaving just the right amount of space needed for some meditation. He doesn't try to teach us a lesson, he wants us to consider what is being told and make our own opinion about it. This absence of manicheism (no good VS evil here) is one of the most beautiful demonstrations of moral integrity in the history of arts.Oh, well, if your favorite movies ever are Aliens, The Matrix or Gladiator, don't even try ""The Pianist"", you'll be bored to death. Wait for some more years, until your taste adjusts, before meeting this masterpiece.My personal award: on par with any masterpiece of the 7th art, including the very best of Kubrick, Kurosawa, Lynch or the Coen brothers (only to mention a few).",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

Sometimes sole description of real-life events can be more dramatic than fiction,"Szpilman's life is just hard to watch. Nazis make him not only hungry and sick but also humiliated and wretched, taking away his family, talents, personality, and even humanity. Military officers force Jews to dance on the street with strangers, whip workers 'to celebrate New Year', and mount & burn dead bodies and leave that heap of ashes as it is. Hopelessness and fear in Jews' eyes leave audience with deeper sorrow and anger against Nazis because these scenes display how Nazis view Jews, not human .. with inferiority. However, against all the difficulties and unfair & unjust treatment, Szpilman always strives to live and go on. His struggles though sad and inhumane because he has to walk away from his family tells that the life as hell is still more worth than the death, the end. After realizing this, his life looks even beautiful.I want to give more credits to screenwriting than directing. With phenomenal life real-figure Szpilman had to live and barbarian historical background, WWII, the director does not need to do much. The scriptwriter does a great job summarizing Szpilman's whole experience during World War II into 150 minutes, no embellishment, very straightforward but still captivating. It is not easy to take a few key events and concentrate on those. Many films adapted from the books often make mistakes of trying to put everything in one basket, a very small one with time limit. The narrative is also very well balanced between simplicity and complexity, many dynamic turn of events but still not distracted from the main story line.The director appropriately combines first-person pov with third-person pov. He follows protagonist's journey, and we can see his growth, realization, and feelings on the way. At the same time, through media such as window, people talking, and turn of the camera, we can also realize what happens in surrounding society and world, holding Nazi accountable for war crime. Cinematography emphasizes human's empty effort for power and greed. Among bombed-down buildings full of debris, Szpilman stands alone, so small like a speck in a distance. In reverse, he stands alone after everything is destroyed, showing his strength, perseverance, and resilience.My favorite scenes are two both when Szpilman plays piano in the air but in different places. The first one is at hiding place, trying to remain quiet not to get caught. The second one is at the wrecked hospital at the abyss of misery. Those two scenes symbolize the whole movie. Szpilman torn between reality and ideal has lost pleasure of playing piano which makes him who he is and his hope. Ironically, playing piano even in the air raises his hope amidst disasters and desolation.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
The Pianist (observation and comment),"What a film!The character played by Adrien Brody was so magnificently and accurately projected. Compared to other films of the era, the actor projected the character with dignity. Even when it was so difficult to remain rational in an irrational time, the character was humble and focused. The characters played by the other cast members were just as smart and outstanding, some times challenging to understand as to why 'Henrick'would react in the way he does to some of the brutes the Germans inflict on ""Jewish prisoners."" Despite his reactions it was also refreshing to know that he would refuse to join the 'Zander Commanders', which he could but he declines to the offer. In times of such difficulties people would do anything to sustain their life even if it is for a second, yet 'Henrick' would refuse to abide by that nature of human traits. Some one said once, 'temptation is a true measure of character.' Even though by joining the 'Zander Commander' he could have benefited himself and his families' stay in the camp would have been improved for the remaining of their days before they were gassed should he join, but he was clear and firm that he wouldn't join'em. It was also comforting to learn that some people in the Polish civil society remained rational in such trying times, such as hiding Szpilman in their flats. Why would they take risk in hiding a Jewish man in their house?I have seen many films projecting a certain time-frame in the history of mankind, this film by far outplays them all. Like 'The Diary of Anne Frank this too is based on true story that really took place in the last century. The Jewish people have suffered tremendously thru out history, especially in Europe. The story projected in this film tingles a normal human to a state of sadness to a point of making one question that such people (Germans/NAZIS) did exist at some point in contemporary Europe. Since I have seen this film I grew very interested in learning why people hate others to such a degree? I have yet to come to the understanding of the concept of hate, but I am learning. Some experts say that hate is a result of fear embraced by self doubt that the hate-monger espouse due to fear he/she may not be able to compete and win over the person/s they wish/intend to eradicate.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

Amazing.,"Wow.Let me start by saying that I despise Schindler's List. I loathe it. Spielberg basically turned the Holocaust into a theme park ride. I must also tell you that I don't like Spielberg.Now I must inform you that I am slightly biased. I am a Jewish Polanski fanatic. So to see this film is like to see a masterpiece in play. The most interesting and arguably, the best facet of the film is when the Szpilman familly is discussing what is going on, basically a round table discussion. It shows the exact emotions of most Jews, and non-Jewish poles during the Holocaust with textbook accuracy. Especially considering that Polanksi was a Holocaust survivor, this gives perfect perspective of the Warsaw ghetto.There are also some who say that the fact that Szpilman(sp?) was a pianist had very little to do with the film at all, but in fact, the piano was one of his few motives to survive throughout the whole film.Please, PLEASE, stop saying that there shouldn't be any more films like this. I think people should stop making Holocaust-related films when everyone believes that it actually happened. I personally know human beings that denied it even happened. Venal.So here's the math: Great plot + great premise + wonderful director + great sets + Chopin The Pianist = one of the best films ever made.

a film of poignancy and precision,"I was in Brussels last week and my brother and I went to see the Pianist. Neither of us new anything about the movie or the subject matter - we simply wanted to see a different film than the one his children chose at the cinema. Imagine what your reaction would be to this film with no preconceived notion of the subject matter.I am not Jewish, or Polish, or German. I was born 10 years after WW2 ended, and so one might think have no vested interest in being so deeply moved by the film. As most Canadians, I have grown up with the overpowering influence of the Americans and of their Hollywood versions of history. Perhaps because of this - or in spite of it - I found the film gripping. I thought Adrien Brody's performance mesmerizing. I felt Polanski served the subject with almost a dispassionate view of events unfolding - whose characters couldn't stop the madness from escalating and whose audience found ourselves forced to be spectators (again) 60 years after the fact.The superlatives are already in place on this board - but there were 2 scenes which I find I revisit because of their poignancy and their precision: one is where the family is being rounded up from the ghetto, and he turns to his sister Halina and with a finality so powerful, says, ""I wish I knew you better."" The other is when he received the packet of bread and jam from Capt. Hosenfeld, and he tastes the jam. In an instant, with only a subtle change in his facial muscles, you sense all that Szpilman had been without. I will now purchase the book, and when the distributors in North America finally show this film, I will go to see it again and take every thinking person I know with me.Sadly, when the film is made about September 11 (and knowing the way the Americans work, there are probably several versions being penned as we speak), I only hope that a man like Polanski can be relied upon to make a truthful, balanced account of yet another instance of man's capacity for committing atrocities.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
"Great Film, Ok it is better than Chicago","I will say it The Pianist should have won Best Picture. But I am not putting down Chicago, I think both movies are great films. The Pianist is a holocaust movie, which is different from the 1993 masterpiece about the Holocaust, noneother than Schindlers List. The Pianist differs from Schindlers List because it spends all of its time in the Warsaw Ghetto, while Schindlers List spent time in the Ghetto and Labor Camps. We get a different point of view what it was like for the Jews. The Jews that stayed behind were forced to do some labor work for Nazis but their were Jews who were hiding in the Ghetto that fought back against them, though they didnt succeed. You dont see any fighting back in Schindlers List at all.Adrien Brody delivers a great performance as a jewish pianist named Szpillman (not sure about spelling). Not Sure if its an award winning prformance but still a great performance. It maybe but I wanna watch the movie again. One thing I am sure about was that Roman Polanski (Director of the brilliant Chinatown) deserved his Oscar for Best Director, it was brilliant direction by a man who is close to 70 years old. The Pianist is a very well written movie but the screenplay is not award winning, I thought Adaptation should have won.This is my overall paragraph and I have alot of overalls to say. Overall, As much as i loved Chicago, The Pianist should have won for its powerful message and portrayal of what one man went through in the Ghetto during World War II. Overall, I prefer Schindlers List but The Pianist is a great film and will be remembered for years to come. Its a great achievement for Polanski. 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Wow.,"""The Pianist"" was a breath of fresh air for me. It has been a long time since I've seen a film this refreshing. I regret not seeing it sooner and if you haven't seen it, I recommend doing so.Painting a ultra-realistic portrait of one man's life during the darkest period in the 20th century, Polanski masterfully and easily shows what he can do with the right kind of brush I have always enjoyed his films; ""Rosemary's Baby"" being one of my all time favorite movies. But ""The Pianist"" is very different. It is quite serious and disturbing while not being gratuitous. The violence shown here is very sickening but it is never overly graphic. It is not exploitative, as it well shouldn't be. It is heart wrenching to say the least. Adrien Brody confidently commands the respect of the viewer in what has to be the role of his career. He definitely deserved the Oscar he got for this one.In short, every human being alive should see this film. It is unbiased, extremely effective and completely genuine. I never doubted for a moment that Roman's heart wasn't in it. Totally timeless and classic. See it!!!10 out of 10, kids.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Humanity at its best and worst,"It must not only be seen because of the subject that can never be studied enough but because it is perfect in every sense. EVERY SENSE.It is perfect in terms of cinema for the performance of every professional involved in this film.It is perfect in terms of subject treatment because for the first time we get a beginning of an answer to the puzzling question ""how could so many see themselves being slowly tortured and slaughtered, let the horror surround them, without more reaction and hysteria, with so much faith?""In the Polish ghetto, Polanski answers. For the first time, we see the everyday life as an everyday life and not as a drama for the drama necessary to a movie. The film serves these humans' story and not just the contrary.Polanski's film does not want us to cry only. he wants us to wonder, explore and discover. It is dreadfully efficient. He shows that Art that is love is the one link that brings one back from barbary to humankind. Each second of it means a future lifetime for the pianist.Polanski brilliantly illustrates the old idea of Art saving humanity in recent times when it was needed more than ever. In that sense, he helps to save us all. THANK YOU.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
"Incredible survival story, and incredible demonstration of the power of cinema.","No other medium in the world has the power to illustrate for us what life would have been like in certain periods of the past but the cinema. One of the most important periods to not let go forgotton is the massacre and repression of Jews in Germany and occupied europe. If war and racism led to people to be killed like dogs and worse, simply for belonging to a certain group, then everyone should know about it, in my opinion, to keep history from repeating itself, and to make sure they didn't die for nothing. Don't turn your back on it - stare this movie in the face and look at what racism and intolerance can lead humans to do to other humans.Scene after scene of such penetrating truth and honesty encapsulate in cinematic episodes the horrors committed by the Nazis, the state of desperation of the Jews and many other aspects of this horrible ordeal, based on the personal memoirs of the main character, famed Polish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman.It was based on the memoirs of Szpilman, which means we know he survives the war, and it was marketed with this in mind, as a survival story. And this, of course, is the main attraction to this movie: not to put oneself through experiencing the horrors of war, which i nevertheless believe is important, but of finding out how in heck a Jew living in Nazi occupied Poland could have survived, and as such it is a remarkable story of hope and courage against unbelievable odds. And not one calculated by a Hollywood studio to manipulate you - this stuff really happened, and to the character portrayed in this movie by Adrian Brody. Some of it also happened to Roman Polanski himself, which made this a very personal project for him.As i mentioned at the beginning, this movie demonstrates the power of cinema, and one of its central themes is the power of the arts, particularly music, to affect people, to make them feel.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Very moving and realistic...,"........I don't have much to add onto what the others here have said-one of the things that struck me was how believable the passing of time. People have slow lives. People have to wait. Refugees hiding in an apt like he was are not exactly racing around to 77 different places in 4 days-they sit, they wait, they hide, they fear that the Nazis will come at any moment, and of course they wait some more. Wars take time. Being forced into a labor camp took time to get thru, slow agonizing months, weeks, days of it. Polanski knows this and shows it. If you want a Michael Bay style MTV jump and cut type editing kinda flick, go elsewheres. This subject matter and this era deserves, merits nothing less than what Polanski gives it.**** believable as anything, kudos to them all for the oscar wins.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Stupendous story told through an equally impressive film.,"That first scene where Wladyslaw Szpilman (Brody) plays in the recording suite, in Warsaw, for the Polish radio station sums up not only the entire film but Szpilman's dedication and attitude towards his music and his ability to play music. He is sitting there, live on air, as bombs rain down on the city before one hits the building he is in. People are starting to panic behind a soundproof window but it is a suspenseful panic because whilst we in the studio can see the panic and stress the disc jockey is going through, we are tantalisingly put on hold in terms of the horror of the attack. Then a bomb hits the studio room we're in and we wake up to what's happening, as does Szpilman. He must stop playing after previously continuing.The next time Szpilman plays the piano in a war zone where his life is threatened will be the crescendo for not only the Second World Wartime journey of horror Szpilman must endure, but also for the last time danger is that close to him as is a piano. There are scenes in the film where he is so close to a piano and yet playing it would result in his quick demise; but he is strong enough and powerful enough to be able to remember the music and play on through his mind  that adds extra importance to that near-the-end wartime scene when he must play with 'danger' watching on.The film begins and ends in Poland, during the Second World War and we are taken through the various stages of horror imposed by the invading Nazi Germans during their assault on most of mainland Europe. The film's opening third acts not too much like a documentary that might shovel the message: ""The Germans were evil people"" down our throats and not too much like an over the top experimental art film. I read that the film is European produced which should come as no surprise because its aesthetic is very much that of realism, the dominant European aesthetic. So we learn of one family's struggle through the days of the Nazi rule and the film presents us with a hierarchy of Nazi invoked violence. There are the initial scenes of humiliation as a man must walk in the gutter for the crime of being Jewish but there is also the equally awkward to watch as I'm sure it was to shoot scene at a cross roads when Jewish strangers must dance together. From here, the levels are cranked up further and further and it's not long before stone cold violence is being presented to us.But The Pianist is much more than a realistic take on Polish struggles at this time with a few scenes inter-cut to show some atrocity. The film is a breath of fresh air and suggest to me that Roman Polanski has viewed previous Second World War film efforts and corrected them where he thinks corrections should be made. Not a fan of Saving Private Ryan for its lack of mentioning other Allies? Well, Polanski takes time out here for his characters to mention the British and the French over the radio they listen to. Squeamish enough to look away from heavy violence in Second World War films but maintain an interest in the subject anyway? Well here, Polanski shoots his action and his violence in such a way that just these scenes alone go a long way in helping label him an 'auteur'.These scenes and shots are littered throughout the film and contain a certain point of view thinking behind them. For instance, when later on in the film there is guerrilla fighting between Germans and ghetto inhabitants, we always see the action from Szpilman's perspective that is to say the camera never cuts to ground level to show the violence or to try and sell it as entertainment. All we know is that one side is over there, one is over here and they fight; another touch being that for most of the time we do not see the rebels or where they shoot from but we do hear the gunfire. Likewise, when a German soldier is hit the camera never cuts to that level to confirm us the kill  everything is done in point of view format from the window and is kept that way. This gives a scene when Szpilman is actually on the ground level and close to a corpse of a woman he saw get shot a few days ago an extra bite because now we are closer to the kill, it is our first proper look at the result of a gunfight that has been and gone  our conscience and awareness catches up with us.And this tactic is used by Polanski more than once. When a crippled Jew is thrown from his balcony, we see it from the Szpilman's window but when Jews are executed by way of the gun, we are helplessly trapped on that ground level and must witness the atrocity, partly because Szpilman is not there watching from afar in his home or from a window. The added disturbance for these kills is that the cripple cannot defend himself and the fact the officer must reload his gun  also notice how each Jew lying down has their own way of dealing with the inevitable: some keep their face down on the floor but others look ahead giving everything added tragedy. The Pianist works on many levels of storytelling and informs as well as shocks without relying on neatly plotted stories  it is a war fought between superpowers told from the point of view of someone who is not a superpower, and the result is brilliant.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Great film,"Polanski does a superb job of recreating the world of WWII Poland. Every detail of the film is exact and mesmerizing (helped greatly by casting non-name actors who inhabit their roles with great feeling and authenticity. There is no opportunity to play ""spot the star"" except for the most seasoned filmgoer.) What happens to Brody is so startlingly, stunningly jaw-dropping it seems surreal at times. Amazingly, Polanski is able to occasionally inject the faintest touches of black humor and irony to this, which makes for some very intriguing viewing. That is not to say that the film is easy to watch. Already a master (for decades) of creating feelings of unease, paranoia and fear in the viewer, Polanski sets into motion a film in which the audience can hardly breathe for fear that their own noise will result in the discovery of the frequently hidden Brody. The film is notable for making sounds such as marching boots, idling cars and faraway voices seem more terrifying than anything Hollywood has ever had to offer in all of its multitudinous thrillers and horror films.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Amazing...,"An adaptation of the autobiography of the same name by Jewish-Polish musician Władysław Szpilman, Roman Polanski's 'The Pianist' is one of the finest biopics I've ever seen to date.

Some people are legendary, some stories are legendary and some films are legendary. All of the three trump cards are available in this film! For me, it's a film that made me the character, I felt like Szpilman every moment, I was hungry when he was hungry, I was scared when he was scared. And I cried when he cried. What A Freaking Life, and What A Bloody Way To Show It!!!Adrien Brody's performance as Szpilman is one of those performances that shine even in the darkest night. It's a performance that is haunted!

Brilliant and ultimately redemptive,"It's hard to watch this film and not think of the situation in the Middle East today. What is worse, being stuffed into cattle cars and sent to death camps or being blown up by suicide bombers (or bulldozed by machines of steel)? For me the answer to this strangely relevant question is the former. I know that the old Jewish Defense League that I recall from my college days, whose slogan was something like, ""Never Again,"" would agree and so would most of the population of Israel. I think the terrorist Islamic groups ought to be required to view this film and/or some others like it on what happened to the Jews in Europe during the time of the Nazis so that they might have a better appreciation of why they will never be able to overrun Israel and why the United States continues to support Israel even while questioning some of Sharon's policies.Director Roman Polanski tells the familiar horror tale, this time with a concentration on the Jews of Warsaw and in particular on the famed pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman. (The screenplay by Ronald Hardwood is based on Szpilman's memoir). Polanski spares us none of the brutality or the sadomasochism that is an inevitable interpretation of the events. He has the Jews meekly acquiesce to the increasingly horrific Nazi demands, and then has them just lie down when told to and accept a bullet through the skull.(Actually the vast majority of the Jews were not shot, of course, since the bullets were too costly and needed elsewhere. Indeed, as long as I am doing an aside, the stupidity of the Nazis in wasting their resources in genocide contributed to their losing the war. Small irony. But of course that was a war they could not win anyway. If by some magic they could have gotten the Jews--especially Jewish physicists--to work for them, that would have been their only chance, which once again demonstrates the self-destructive nature of Hitler and his followers.)Polanski shows us the Jews who collaborated with the Nazis and he even has a Jewish boy in the compound as they await the cattle cars selling candy at inflated prices, and then later a Nazi who talks to his Jewish workers about trading goods and says, rubbing his fingers together, ""That's what you're good at, isn't it?""It is interesting to compare The Pianist with Vittoria De Sica's The Garden of the Finzi-Continis (1971), an entirely different sort of film, but one with a similar theme and some similar scenes as the Jews, this time Italian Jews, are loaded into the cattle cars. The experience in these films is always the same for me in at least one respect. I want so much to shout: ""Do something! Don't let it happen! Charge them with the sheer mass of your bodies, if nothing else. Better to die fighting than to die like cattle."" But of course I was not there. We think we know what we would do, but unless we are confronted with the actual situation, we don't know. And of course we have hindsight.At one point, Szpilman and his brother are talking as they eat their thin soup and their bread. The brother tells him that the cattle cars are going to Treblinka but they return empty and that there are no cars containing food that go that way. He concludes, ""They are exterminating us.""Polanski's point is that the Nazis were able to actually commit their ghastly mass murders (and the German populace to excuse them) because they had come to believe that Jews were not human and that they were only killing vermin. The Jews had been demonized, which is the first step toward genocide. We declare that our enemies are not human, and that allows us to kill them with moral impunity. I had a new thought while I watched this time, thinking: a respect for animals and a belief in animal rights might serve as a moral buffer so that when one group of people hate each other and begin to turn the other into animals, they will still have a step to go before they can begin the mass murders.It is in the second half when Szpilman goes into hiding that Polanski's film distinguishes itself. Here the focus is entirely on Szpilman and his need to survive. The cinematography of the Warsaw streets, the apartments he lives in, the snow, the gray buildings, the people below in the streets, the hunger, the music that he hears in his mind but cannot play, the burned-out buildings, and then the scene in which the German officer says, ""Play something"" and he does. It is here that the film becomes magical and a testament to the best that is in humans. Note that the pianist has become in his beard and his persecution a Christ-like figure who never raised a hand against anyone. He is the Christ who turned the other cheek. And note that it is his ethereal talent as a great musician that saves him. This is Polanski's message and the reason he made the film. The best that is in humans can rise above the brute that is in humans.See this for Adrien Brody, who gave it everything he had, and then some. His performance will haunt you. Polanski's clear, Hollywood-like, almost Spielbergian direction, tells the story a bit too brightly at times, and a bit too simplistically at others, but he has planned well so that in the end we see that he has told it brilliantly. See this because we need to be reminded of what can happen when we give way to hate and prejudice.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

The Cinema of Roman Polanski; A survivor's tale.,"The Pianist (2002) was Roman Polanski's most personal film to date and an acting tour de force for Adrian Brody. The movie takes place during World War II. A brilliant pianist is forced to live like an animal during the war. Since he's of Jewish heritage, his family and others that have been ""branded"" with the star of David are forced to life in concentration camps and ghettos. But this film is not about this topic, that has been beaten to death already. The PIanist is about surviving and keeping one's head together just so they could live another day. Adrian Brody was quite impressive as the Pianist. He conveyed emotion and acting on a level that I never thought he could have ever attained. Roman Polanski's direction was razor sharp and he creates an environment that felt so authentic and real.In many ways the Pianist also reflects upon the life of Roman Polanski. He has been in the same situations before and has experienced life in the ghettos and camps. Just like the title character, Roman Polanski is a survivor and he can still make films with the best of them.Highest recommendation possible.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
"Brody, Polanski Most Deserving","For maybe the second time in the past twenty years, I am thrilled with the Best Actor winner.  I found Adrien Brody's performance to be pitch-perfect. It reminded me a little of Gregory Peck in ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", who also won.  They shared a quiet intensity, an understated dignity and do not chew on the scenery in an attempt for attention.  Brody's win might signify a maturity among voters, a willingness to honor an actual performance on the screen.  So many people had Jack or Daniel winning, and I congratulate the voters on seeing what Adrien Brody brought to the movie.  Let's face it, with Eminem, Pedro Almovodar and Polanski/Brody winning, it might have been just an atypical year, and next year they can get back to giving awards to non-actors like Julia Roberts and Helen Hunt..I can't honestly say that I've seen another movie like it, even though there have been a slew of movies on the subject.  Several scenes are very intense, but you have to know that going in.Congrats to Roman, too.  If it were up to me, he would have won Best Director for ""Rosemary's Baby"" in 1968.

"A decent, but unspectacular Holocaust movie","The Pianist is a by the numbers movie about the life and times of a pianist trying to live through the Nazi occupation of Warsaw. A beautiful musical score predictably results. The pianist himself is an altogether unsympathetic character - we want him to live because we don't want to be cruel, but otherwise we wouldn't have any particular attraction to this man. The movie itself is strictly, for the most part, paint by numbers. Nazis are bad, Jews are innocent yet determined survivors. Well, more to the point, Nazis are bad, though deep down inside they appreciate fine culture and some of them have good hearts. The Soviets, on the other hand, are uniformly bad and stupid, it seems.The lessons of the Holocaust must never be forgotten. However, the pivotal lessons of the Holocaust are not ""Nazis are bad Jews are innocent yet determined survivors."" Those sort of lessons are historical details along the lines of ""The Magna Carta was signed in 1066."" The real lessons of the Holocaust center around what happens when we stop looking at each other as human beings and start looking at each other as cartoons or stereotypes. This is a by the numbers movie specifically because it does what most movies do - it starts with existing cartoon/stereotype views and builds characters around them to tell a story. A better movie would have begun in that place, but then used the power and magic of film to challenge our preconceptions and our stereotypes to truly convey and reinforce a message of hope for humanity.Your life will not be any poorer if you never see this movie, but you won't feel that you wasted your time, either, if you do.

Scary parallels to present Iraqi war. Adrien Brody is jaw-droppingly amazing!,"I just saw ""The Pianist"" at my local theater. It is Saturday, and the British and American armies and air forces are in day four of their invasion of Iraq. I couldn't help but notice the parallels between the German invasion of Poland in the movie, and events just now unfolding. In 1939 the Germans had their own ""documented"" grievances against the ""aggressive"" Poles. Later it was revealed that the dead German bodies produced for the German newsreel footage justifying their invasion of Poland were just some corpses the Nazis rounded up, and dressed in German and Polish uniforms. Point to make is that 69% of the Germans--- otherwise law abiding, Christian, decent people, probably felt the same grim determination modern day American and British peoples feel toward Iraq. No one is cheering the deaths, but they are nonetheless sanctioning them, in the name of some political agenda. Saddam as Hitler? Yes--- but Bush and Blair as Hitlers, too? Sadly, it seems so. ""The Pianist"" gives a human face to the real victims--- and I am fearful that many innocent Iraqis may get a double dose of what this movie points out--- first from their own government, and now again from ours.""The Pianist"" portrays the fate of Polish Jews during world war two. The movie is a true masterpiece, surpassing most other movies that have undertaken the story. I attended the movie reluctantly--- I did not feel like sitting through another retread of the same old theme, and the same old victims and villains. Great reviews tempted me, however, and I am glad I went. Adrien Brody, the star of the movie, is amazing. His performance was breathtaking. Really. I hope he wins his Oscar Sunday night.

Incredibly well-made,"The story revolved only on Szpilman who was trying to understand how the world he lived in was falling apart. We see how the protagonist evolves from a well respected artist to a nomad who fights for his own survival. The film also shows details on the life of Jews before being brutally murdered by the Nazis. It was a very sad and tragic film compared to Schindler's List because of some gruesome events of the Holocaust. Since the film was set up in Warsaw, Poland it helps the viewers to delve more on the life of Szpilman. The music and sound effects that were used on the movie was also natural and added more emotions to the story. However, There are lots of disturbing scenes in this film that will make your stomach roll. The movie is not gory but the events will let you question how evil a man can be. All in all, The Pianist because it was based on real events of the life of Wladyslaw Szpilman. While watching the movie you will realize that you are actually not watching a film about a hero but rather a survivor. Adrien Brody's method acting makes this movie one of a kind.

Brilliant,"The Pianist reduces the human being to its most basic instinct: to survive. Along the way, through excellent directing and acting, the audience is taken on a emotional roller-coaster ride. The joy of family and the love each shares. The cruelty of the dark side of human nature. The things one is willing to do and go through in order to survive. The fear of life and death. The fear within each of us that keeps us wanting to stay alive. Depressing but very real, a lot of emotion is expressed in The Pianist. At the end you will leave with a heavy heart because THIS is something like you've never witnessed before: we're too comfortable in this modern age, we have yet to experience the horrors of being war victims. But also, this movie will sharpen those humanistic qualities within us that has been washed away by the worries of money etc. in the contemporary life.

Just Brutal,"A Polish pianist tried to survive and hide during the gruesome years of WWII. Another film that I've wanted to watch.Right of the bat this movie was incredibly brutal and realistic in showing the horror and abuse that happened Poland. There were a lot of bodies, from old to young, and people getting shot at gun point. Also, poverty and struggle was also on full display. I went from shock to disbelief at the inhumanity I was witnessing.Most of the violence was shown in the first half, and the second half became more of a survival trip. The pianist barely held on to his life, and I felt pain for the character, being from one of the best pianist to rag.There were little background music to the movie. The only background music were piano songs during the transition of scenes. No music at all when the horror was on the screen.By not being shy from showing the violence, the movie emphasized the injustice and inhumanity that the Nazi brought to the Jewish people. However, even more surprising was that there were still some heart during this gruesome time.My issue was that since this is a survival story, audiences didn't get to learn too much about the main character, other than the fact that he was a pianist. It made sense for this type of movie, but I wished there were more to feel with the character even more.Overall, a brutal and powerful movie. 8.5/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

It brings home the horrors of Nazi treatment of Jews - as well as some Jews' treatment of others, like no other World War II film.Adrien Brody and the rest of the cast are superb. Adding to their performances is a sparse score, mostly major works of classical music, that serve profoundly to punctuate the mood at all the right moments. The cinematography is likewise apt.The history is related unsentimentally, through the eyes of the main character, who watched unspeakable horrors and documented it in a memoir from which this movie was made. By its honesty, the film becomes personal, and thus not only evokes, but demands an emotional response.This film will move you to tears, so be prepared for a difficult emotional journey.

The best Polish film in years,"I was not a big fan of Polanski's work before I saw 'The Pianist.' I wasn't crazy about 'Rosemary's Baby' or 'Chinatown,' or any of his early his that some of my friends watched millions of times. I kind of liked 'Repulsion,' but that was it, and I'd only seen it once and have not felt like giving it a try again since. But watching Roman's latest release felt like something so much different, something more than any of the 'good' films I have enjoyed watching in the past weeks, years maybe. Throughout the whole two and a half hours, I was never for a single second bored or distracted, my thoughts could not drift away from the story that was so majestically unwrapping in front of me, making me a solitary witness of Wladyslaw Szpilman's wartime fate.The entire room was silent from the first moment, when on screen appeared pre-war movie chronicles, showing Warsaw on a sunny summer day, with people crowding its streets, parks, theaters and avenues, lined with 19th century apartment buildings, similar to the ones you can see in today's Vienna or Prague. And then the viewer's quickly taken indoors of the building where the Polish Radio station used to be, inexisting today, into the recording studio where the well known pianist, Wladyslaw Szpilman, is on the air, in the middle of a concert created by that most Polish of all composers, the quintessential exiled patriot spilling his heart out in memory of his lost fatherland, also one of the most talented pianists of all time, Frederic Chopin. Chopin's music will return later in the film, and in the grandiose closing scene the surviving Szpilman will be shown once again, playing his music in front of a full-house audience in the Warsaw Philharmonic, barely a year after the end of the war. It has been pointed out by the all-knowing Polish film critics that such a 'structure' is typical of Polanski's works, as many of his movies begin and end with a very similar scene, the story coming back to the point where it had started. Is it something that comes out unnatural? Artificial? Awkward? Certainly not, and having witnessed the whole terrible madness and turmoil of war, the viewer barely notices the resemblance between that elegant, solemn concert at the end of the film and the more 'private,' intimate moment of Szpilman's opening performance so brutally interrupted by bombings. But the critics w i l l  analyze that, so let them do it. that's how they earn their bread.But what annoyed me most about one unfriendly review of 'The Pianist,' published in one of Poland's most popular weeklies, 'Polityka,' was the unprofessional tone of the writing, which all in all sounded more like some piece written for a school paper by a cross young boy  envious of a friend's successful performance in a school play. The author just could not resist painting himself as a lone ranger daring to criticize a medium-quality film (or, as he puts it, an unfulfilled work made of a very promising story), while everyone else in Cannes was on their knees complimenting the director on his latest production. Very strange, because in my opinion a critic at work would better use their eyes and hearts and souls rather than their personal feelings, especially the pride and envy that devours them, when finally, after years of repetitive and imitative trash we have been given a truly great movie. And what do the critics do? They ignore completely the authentic and deeply moving power that radiates from the screen, and put down the absurd statement that Adrien Brody's acting is 'surprisingly emotionless, as if the whole story was happening next to him, without his participation.' And all that under a huge still of the actor walking by himself on a deserted ghetto street with scattered personal belongings of the people just driven away to be executed, with as desperate a look on his face as it's only possible, including red eyes screaming desperation, beautifully raised eyebrows and a half-open mouth- the face of a weeping, deeply disturbed man.And in the end I'd like to add that, again in spite of what the critics say, this film is not a cleverly made string of tricks that Polanski turns on us, nor is it a line of very convincing 'real-life scenes' from the ghetto, shown more like stills on a projector than a film production. It is in fact a rather fast-paced story, only as fast as needed to give the viewer an honest picture of what war was like in Warsaw, or, for that matter, any other big town in Poland (Polanski himself spent much time in the ghetto in Cracow when he was a child). It has scenes of fighting: we learn about the outbreak and defeat of the Ghetto uprising in 1943, and the great Warsaw Uprising in August 1944, at the same time as Szpilman, already in hiding outside of the ghetto. We see examples of bravery and sacrifice, but also of spite, swindles and denunciation. But also we see people passing through Szpilman's life, touching him for a moment, then disappearing, then emerging again, by chance, people he has known, people he loved, befriended, people who helped and who used him to get their own. And finally the incredible character of the German officer, wonderfully placed by Thomas Kretschman, to whose kindness the artist was to owe his life, illuminates the story with a lighter, poetic shade of raw feeling. And, very important information for all my American friends: it's all in English, except for a few passages in German which I believe are accompanied by subtitles!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

A must see!,"I was deeply touched by this film about a Polish pianist trying to escape the horrors of the Warsaw Ghetto.Other than many Holocaust movies, this one has no humorous intermezzi to interrupt the gruesome reality displayed. I consider this to be an interesting directorial choice. In a way it makes it even harder to watch, but that's what makes it more realistic than other films about this subject. Reality in the Warsaw Ghetto was torture, period.Film will always be an entertainment medium. Therefore the director needs to be extremely careful not to turn a serious topic like the Holocaust into something ""entertaining"", for example by bringing up a lighter subject every now and then, allowing the viewer to relax. Polanski did a fantastic job in using the medium without jeopardizing the contents of his film. No emotional scene was cheesy, no scene appears ""staged"", no over dramatized acting, no tearjerking violins. And the result: an even more emotionally moving piece. A message that doesn't seem forced, and yet there is one.On a side note: I venture to say not every Nazi was intentionally doing evil. Many jumped on the bandwagon not knowing what they got themselves into, unable to quit once they found out. Watch carefully, especially towards the ending, and you will discover an interesting character.""We are here not because of ourselves.

The Hollow-caust,"As a lifelong fan of movies and of Roman Polanski, I approached this movie with high expectations. I have seen a number of Holocaust movies, of varying quality: the great Schindler's List, the very good Triumph of the Spirit, and the absolutely despicable Life is Beautiful to name a few. I would have to place The Pianist in the middle somewhere.This beautifully shot and produced film unfortunately has no plot or story. The main character is a bland person in every way, with the exception of his musical abilities. And it is clearly due to these musical abilities that others are constantly helping him in the movie. Certainly not due to his personality or character, of which he has none. Adrien Brody stumbles through this picture like some carrot-beaked scarecrow, evoking no compassion from the audience for his fate, a fate that is considerably more fortunate than millions of other Jews in the period.Polanski created a wonderfully visual and accurate portrait of the time and place, but Brody created a mere shadow of a human being as its central character.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Blows away that Disney-Holocaust Spielberg melodrama.,"The longer the 2nd WW is behind us, the more films and books fill in our perception of that event. The most important aspect to The Pianist is: it blows away that Disney-Holocaust Spielberg epic. Polanski is very modest here, and that suits him and the film. The fact that the things we don't see, but only suggested with, are even more horrific than the horror we do get to see is a fantastic approach. It is seldom we can see a picture where one has to think, an fill in, instead of being fed. But there is a downsize: the story stays very close to the book, in fact, it adds nothing new to it, except for the stunning images. With the same imagination we use in the film, we can read the book and get the same result.But then again, the longer ago the event is, the more important nowadays it is for people to go and see this very solid and integer picture.

Polanski's Best,"It was a fine movie that could have benefited from some tighter editing. Brody was brilliant in the lead role, and Polanski has easily made the most harrowing movie of his career.I haven't read the book, but one thing that fascinated me about the first 1/3rd or so of the movie was that life in the ghetto was almost being told from a child's perspective. Certain things had an emphasis that I wonder if they came from the book or from Polanski's memories of being a child in the middle of the Holocaust. For example:Szpilman keeps running into a somewhat deranged woman whowanders the ghetto in a fur coat, looking for her husband.There's an old man entertaining a group of children.The way the adults dove for food that hit the ground.Many shots of the ghetto seem to be taken from close to the ground looking up, not so much at Szpilman's eye level.There was also good use of sound throughout the movie, but I note that it was not nominated for a Best Sound Oscar.The movie is interesting in that, here and there, there's an attempt to humanize a Nazi, something pretty much unseen in Holocaust movies since the late '70s miniseries The Holocaust (the Michael Moriarty character, while he invents ways to more rapidly exterminate Jews, feels very guilty about it). The music-loving commander near the end of the movie, who sees the end and would rather not go out of his way to kill every Jew he stumbles over.The main flaws in the movie were a tendency to let scenes drag a little (particularly towards the middle) and not really indicating what a celebrity Szpilman was pre-war (if that was the case). According to the movie, he seemed to be the last person to perform on Polish radio before the Germans took over. For nearly half of the movie, he's no where near a piano (for obvious reasons), but, when he is, he seems like he's a talented but fairly pedestrian classical pianist. Is surviving the war what made him great?",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
"The Pianist - Sometimes, the Greatest Revenge is Survival","The Pianist is Adrien Brody's role of a lifetime. He will most likely never encounter a script or role as good as this one. The director Roman Polanski, has a good grasp of the emotional devastation caused by the Nazis in WW 2 Poland. This film depicts one survivor of the horrors that were present in the city of Warsaw during that unfortunate period.The survivor is a talented pianist, played by Brody. Szpilman, the pianist portrayed in this film, is living like an animal, under the boarding of a piece of furniture in an officer's office. He crawls under it to sleep at night, and only comes out for food and water during the daytime, as well as playing a piano that is in the office. It is this talent that keeps him alive, and out of the concentration camps that killed millions during this horrendous conflict.My ten-year old son asked me why I didn't care for silly vampire and zombie movies that so many kids love. I made him watch this film. After the movie, he said zombie and vampire movies are nothing compared to horrors of that situation. I'm glad he got the point.By the way, how did Chicago beat out this film for Best Movie? Did Weinstein have that much pull in Hollywood at the time? I guess he did.

Music was his passion. Survival was his instinct.,"""The Pianist"" is doubtless well crafted and technically and artistically sound albeit naive and conventional. The film parses into one hour of a stereotypical and exploitive regurgitation of the horrors of the Nazi reign over the Warsaw ghetto, where every German soldier is more evil than Satan and every Jew a pathetic victim, and one hour of Brody living like a rat foraging for sustenance amid the Warsaw ruination. Only in the very end does the film introduce a bit of irony and a sympathetic Nazi after countless missed opportunities to breath something fresh into what is just another in a very long list of films about the infamous ghetto (Families torn apart, summary executions, etc.).  Brody delivers a fine performance as a pianist and the film's centerpiece but is not required to perform the range of emotion deserving of a little gold statuette. Overall, the film is worthwhile but shows us nothing new and exploits rather than honors the memory of those Polish Jews who died in the conflict.

Adrian Brody's Terrfic in this wartime Biopic,"This is an excellent movie/biography of a famed Jewish and Polish pianist during the occupation of Poland (specifically Warsaw) from 1939-45. Over the course of the filming Adrian Brody lost an astonishing amount of weight while he realistically portrayed a Jewish man that suffers horrific indignities while imprisoned in the Warsaw Ghetto. Roman Polanski the director spliced some incidents of his own childhood (as he lived in Krackau during the Nazi occupation) and those of the real Pianist, along with some other experiences of Poles and Jews in the Polish Ghettos at that same time. This picture was filmed in Poland in some of the oldest existing apartment blocks to provide some realism, and the movie relies very little on special effects during the German invasion or that of the Soviet/German fighting and destruction while the city was nearly destroyed. It was very interested to see real (although brief) footage and faces of Warsaw peacetime before the Sept 1 1939 invasion. No doubt many of those people did not survive the years of occupation, genocide and war and were the real people that this movie tries to portray. Thomas Kretchsmann is memorable as the real life German officer who has some interaction with Brody's character and was celebrated later in life for helping some Jews survive Nazi occupation.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
A masterpiece,"I don't use the word `masterpiece' very often, maybe only once or twice when writing my thoughts on a movie.  `The Pianist' was a masterpiece.  I have rarely been so taken into a movie, its atmosphere, its reality, as I was in this one.  It also brought to life a portion of history with which I thought I was familiar but whose horrors and day-to-day miseries have never been portrayed quite so clearly.  I was very glad the film was in color, as opposed to black and white, for the simple fact that I wanted to see what the people were going through as if I were seeing it myself.  I like black-and-white for artistic reasons, but color was a good choice for realism.  Adrien Brody's performance was very touching and real.  You could almost feel his fear, his suffering, and his physical pain, mainly from hunger.This is one of those movies that made me think about how blessed I am and how blessed I have been in my life because I have never had to experience anything nearly as hellish as the life that was portrayed in this movie. I can only imagine the feeling of desperation these people must have had day after day.  The brutality and sheer insanity of war was once again quite vividly portrayed; everyone should pay attention and learn what beasts human beings can really be.There is a line in the movie that was very understated and not particularly necessary to the plot, but the scene where Szpilman tells his sister that he just wished he could have gotten to know here better and she simply replies `Thank You' with such emotion in her voice, brought tears to my eyes.Very rewarding and a must see.  Roman Polanski tops everything he has done, and that's something to behold.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Haunting WWII film.,"Revisiting this film I found it really holds up very well. The film opens with invasion and the coming occupation of Warsaw, a family must now decide whether to flee, and if so where to go? Our main character is a middle-class musician, cultured, well dressed, handsome but his world is now turned up side down. The early scenes of the city apartments being emptied, of glass smashing, radio falling silent and distress are all really well directed and acted. We next move now to the Warsaw ghetto and the casual brutality and contempt the occupiers now display to the inhabitants. Our main character is still able to work as a pianist but his life now is looking increasingly precarious. The family fortune dwindles, money has little value anymore. You really have to give high praise to the costumes, props and locations, I really felt myself there living it. This is an English language film but you don't really hear any English accents which at least helps. It has a bit of a desaturated look but it's still very much something shot on film and not at all like some digital films we get now. The story is very much that of the pianist, everything that happens we see through his eyes. The thuggery and terror brought by the Nazis is revolting and shocking. There's a tiny bit of CGI but mostly it's all in camera and I have to give the production values very high praise. At times I did slightly loose track of what year it was, maybe that's deliberate. I also found our main character very passive, there's no mad heroics, no impassioned speeches from him, he's probably too shocked for anything remotely like that. As I said it's very much his story, we have no sense of who's winning or losing the war, no cut aways to generals looking at maps or giving out orders really. There's some great physical acting in here too, our main character's appearance change so much as he lives a more and more hunted and animal like life. He is truly just a survivor in an increasingly dangerous landscape. We see some acts of defiance and resistance, his life though is terribly lonely and he carries with him his love of music throughout his life on the run.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Another gem from Roman Polanski,"Polanski has always been a great director and his art and genius is unmatched. There are very few directors who can match him and he is a force to reckon with. In this movie, Polanski provides ample proof of the horrors of holocaust. Adrien Brody confirms that he is an actor with more than just good looks. The movie also won the Best Director Academy Award for Polanski which was long due. The biggest strength of this movie is that it does not try to take any sides. Only a great director like Polanski could have made such a heart touching and sensitive movie. The movie once again confirms why good cinema is so essential for our society and it needs to be treasured for the coming generations.

Finally he escaped from the workshop, where selected Jewish people were working under control of Nazis, and decided to hide himself.

The movie does not merely portray on military fighting or any serious battles but it focuses mainly on the life of Splitzman (played by Adrien Brody) who was known to be the most famous pianist in Poland at the time.His life headed for the worse after his family was taken away and he was forced to work hard labor for the Nazis. Though later he escapes and was hidden by some generous Polish people, his life became a nightmare after everyone in town left due to the effects of the war and he was left all alone to face & hide from the Germans with whatever strength, leftover food and luck he had...till the Russians came.The best war related kind of movie since Schlinder's List.

"Another Movie About the Massacre of Jews in the Second World War, With an Outstanding Performance of Adrien Brody","Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) is a Polish Jewish pianist very famous in Warsaw. When Germany invades Poland, his wealthy family and him are sent to the Warsaw Ghetto. Them they are sent to Treblinka, but Szpilman escapes in the train station. He struggles to survive, hidden in the most different places and depending on friend's sympathy to stay alive. He survives the war and died in the year 2000. This movie is a super production, very well directed by Roman Polanski and having an outstanding performance of Adrien Brody. However, this sad story does not present anything that was not showed before, like, for example, `Schindler`s List' did some years ago. There is a good movie (`Uprising' (2001), TV), showing better the events of the Warsow Ghetto uprising, but the intention of `The Pianist' is to show the true saga of Szpilman. I can perfectly understand that Jewish persons, who are majority in the cinema industry, have a great interest in keeping alive the atrocities of the Second World War. But these movies are very repetitive, showing horrible dramas of the most different survivors, or persons who died. However, there are so many other massacres of races to be explored through the human history and unfortunately they are not showed in movies like the murder of Jewish in the WWII. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): `O Pianista' (`The Pianist')",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
"Dark, epic and moving","In this dark, epic and moving film, the suffering of Jews in the Warsaw ghetto is brought to life. Brody's performance, for which he won an Oscar, is breathtaking. With understated and fine-tuned acting, he portrays Władysław Szpilman, a talented Polish Jewish pianist who struggles to survive during the German occupation of Poland. The characters were very realistic, because they were not just good or bad--the Jews had mixed reactions toward the violence in the ghettos, the Poles helping the Jews escape had varying motives (some slightly dubious), a Nazi officer aided Szpilman near the end of the movie. The slow infiltration of anti-Semitism is portrayed realistically--first, Szpilman's family must wear stars of David on their arms, a seemingly harmless requirement. However, the Nazis' demands quickly escalate and soon the family is forced into the Warsaw ghetto. What began with a star on a coat sleeve culminates in Szpilman's family being taken to the ghetto, and then later to a concentration camp. My favorite scene is when Szpilman is confined to an empty apartment with a piano. Unable to make any noise, he sits down and runs his fingers along the keys as if playing. We hear the music, but see only his fingers making patterns across the keys. This scene is brilliantly directed and in a way symbolizes the Poland that Szpilman once knew, now forever changed by the Holocaust.http://bitesizemoviereview.blogspot.com/",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Brilliant film about the Holocaust,"Mesmirizing performance from Brody. Gorgeous camera-work from Polanski that perfectly captures the desolation and destruction of wartime Poland. Perfect pacing in terms of storytelling. On top of this, an achingly beautiful subplot that highlights the sorrow of a man who is stripped of his ability to express his innermost feelings through music, a craft which he has dedicated his entire life to. The soundtrack music that we do hear is rightfully tragic. Not only does this rank up there with Schindler's List as the most brilliant film depicting the events of the Holocaust, it is simply one of the greatest films ever made of any genre. Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Perhaps Polanski's masterpiece,"Every time I listen to Chopin or Paderewski, every time I read Gunther Grass or Grazyna Borkowska, or I see a film like `Schindler's List' (qv) or this one - `The Pianist' - I catch myself saying `poor Poland'.A country that has been squashed uncomfortably between two erstwhile powerful nations, Germany and the then U.S.S.R., and that has even managed to disappear as a nation from the map, but has managed to maintain its national sense and feeling and identity, obviously imposes one's  respect. There can be, I feel, no denying that Poland was probably the nation which most suffered in the Second World War. And including the more than two million Jews who then lived there. All attempts at genocide are deplorable, whether it be the massacres of ex-Jugoslavija in Bosnia and Kersovo; whether it be the annihilations in Timur; whether it be the endless conflicts in Sierra Leone, Liberia or the Congo.It should be fairly easy then to understand why I rate `Schindler's List' as one of the best U.S. films - though almost entirely made in Europe - very high on my list, and why Roman Polanski's film runs nicely alongside. The fact that there is but just one decimal point between these two films on IMDb's `Top 250' listing does not surprise me in the least, and in fact I might - I repeat - might - even reverse the two on my own list. Yes, both are great films; both scoring around 8,7 on my own personal rating.Roman Polanski has, for me, always been a rather up-and-down director, such that `Rosemary's Baby' is a fine horror film; but his adaptation of Arturo Pérez-Reverte's novel for his film called `The Ninth Gate' (qv) was rather poor, not to say unacceptable. However, with `The Pianist' he has put together what must be his own personal masterpiece. Resorting to British, French, German, Russian and of course Polish commitment in the making of the film, and is thus a pan-European production, he managed to assemble some of the best possible means for making a tremendous film. And it is tremendous: from the scene setting to the interpretations of the the actors. It was all so terribly real; the Warsaw ghetto seizes your heart; the summary executions freeze your blood.Adrien Brody as Wladyslaw Szpilman, on whose autobiography the film is built, is most certainly excellent, not just for his acting of the character, but also for his piano playing: Brody himself descends from a Hungarian mother. Szpilman not only composed for the piano, but also composed numerous songs. He died only a few years ago, nearly 90 years of age. Maybe he was not the greatest perfectionist in interpretation - that kind of thing is for people like Dinu Lipatti, Vladimir Horowitz, the Russian Sviatoslav Richter, or even the great master Wilhelm Kempff. But he was another real person in the midst of the carnage of Warszawa (Warsaw). Brody's feeling for this part was really extraordinary; a highly commendable performance.Fortunately the rest of the film's making was up to his standard, such that, without any doubt, Polanski's `The Pianist' is one of the great cinematographical classics of the last couple of decades.Wojciech Kilar's music combines nicely with Nocturnes and Waltzes from Frydryk Chopin, the Moonlight Sonata by Beethoven, and I think I caught a piece by Franz Liszt, though I am not sure.Brilliant photography and scene-setting rounds off a well-produced film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
"Stoic, haunting tale of survival","The Pianist tells the story of such a man in war time Poland, played by Adrien Brody, who from start to finish sees his life literally getting worse and worse and worse- starts off with new rules from the Nazis, then the stars on the arms, followed by the Warsaw ghetto, and while there he could play in the restaurant, that too soon ended, as the trains arrived and took his family and anyone else he knew away. During this he narrowly escapes, and from then on the film in a sense almost becomes not exactly a holocaust film, but more like a cross of that as the element and the basic structure of something a-la in Cast Away: this includes stretches of scenes showing Brody simply trying to keep out of view of the Germans, either in a small apartment provided by helpful Polish Christians/Jewish resistance, or as a scavenger in the abandoned sections of the ghetto, all while feeling the old rhythm of the piano in his head and fingertips.This is the kind of magnificent filmmaking that shows a director not only being as true to the story given to him (that of Painist Szpilman, based on his autobiography) but to his past as well- Roman Polanksi faced similar conditions as a boy in the early 40's, and has found the best line to show, never crossed or mis-stepped, in representing the characters and the period. There aren't any hints of tightened suspense, no clues as to where the film could veer to, it just is. The big difference to be seen between a film like this and Schindler's List is not just in the people and situations (Schindler's List was a film about two people, Schindler and Goeth, in the foreground while the Pianist is a total first person tale), yet also in the filmmaking qualities being here surely European. And while the accents on the Polish-Jewish actors sounds a bit too British, that is quite forgivable considering the scope of the project (thank heavens he didn't put in English speaking Germans).",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

How not to handle the Holocaust...,"I have to say that my viewing of the Pianist was hampered somewhat by a visit to the Imperial War Museum in London where I saw images of the holocaust that were so disturbing I had to hold myself back from choking.I was intrigued to see how Polanski (he raped a fourteen year old girl by the way-but thats not why I disagree slightly with the film) handled the horror, and I was confused.Yes, this was about the Jewish repressionm torture, and eventual execution but the film felt like a general refugees story with some 'Look at the evil Nazis' set pieces.  In this respect I thought it was disrespectful to what I had seen actually happen in the stock footage from the war.THe characters were only established as Jewish because the Nazis were killing them - where was evidence of culture and heritage?  This would have made the destruction of this hertiage all the more tragic, but no, we didnt see it, so they could have been anybodies - the tragedy lay in the Nazis illogical motivations to eradicate the Jewish people, did it not?Choosing Brody was a mistake too- yes, his acting is brilliant, but if that wasn' a case of the casting director saying,  ""Look, he has a big nose, he's quite trendy at the moment too isn't he?, he looks Jewish (stereotype!), let's hire him"", then I don't know what is.'Private Ryan' managed to personalise this entire issue in one character and was emotionally sucessful, with Schindler's list presenting the same events from this film much more emotionally.  We did not know the victims - but we weren't supposed to, the alienation made created helplessness in the audience: with 'The Pianist' we're meant to identify with the characters, but unfortunately we couldn't, because they were cardboard cut outs, and so their tradgedy becomes almost farce, and therefore innacurate and unworthy of acclaim.I think it has become fasionable to praise this film, so make up your mind after you've seen it whether you like it or not.  Please.The formal elements are excellent though, with the editing a big achievement, keeping the pace gradual and interest inducing.  The music was good, and the ending quite touching, I also enjoyed the subjective POV shots during the combat sequences - the sense of space created was sublime.Narratively though, contrived and underplayed.

Nothing redeeming about this drivel...,"Having read a fair amount about the Warsaw Ghetto, this movie seemed to trivialize it to me. I know that I am not stating a popular opinion, but I found that this film, which put so little into character development and so much into plot, was a failure. *We already know the plot*. So what is the point of the film? Nothing, in my opinion, it adds nothing to what has already been established, and pales in comparison to reading memoirs from the people who were there. Even in terms of plot, there are jagged edges in this film and it is generally an unsmooth and uninteresting ride through material that has been covered ad infinitum by better writers. Rarely have I been this bored in a movie. The violence, I felt, was extremely Hollywood--it was meant to portray the evil Germans against the good Jews. Not that I am a Nazi, but such a ridiculous simplification annoys me. More interesting is how an entire nation (Germany) could allow this to happen--a point which goes entirely unaddressed as we watch three hours of another Jew in another awful situation. A member of the Einsatzgruppen who was killing the Jews was as much a person as Szpilman, with emotions and responses just like his.  The fact that they are destroying other humans does not mean that they themselves are not human, although this fact is ignored in this movie and others by portraying them as monsters.  Isn't there some psychological (and as a result, cinematic) ground to break here?  I feel that most people are familiar with the experience of the Jews--if we must revisit this part of history again, why not try it in a different way?  I hope I don't offend anyone with these comments, because I don't mean to marginalize the suffering that happened, but I feel that with distance we get clarity about a situation. Since no large group (to my limited knowledge of the world) still misunderstands the holocaust, this type of emotional drivel is pointless and gets the public riled up over something long dead, without adding anything new whatsoever.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

I cried several times during the film, and it was difficult to make it though the end of the movie. I can easily understand now, why Polanski received an Academy award for best director, and Adrian Brody for Best Actor. The role of Wladyslaw Szpilman would've taxed and challenged the talents of any elite male actor in Hollywood, and yet Adrien Brody accomplished the task better than anyone I can imagine. He translated the character's hopes, loves, and especially his horror and despair in such a genuine fashion, that it's amazing that it comes from a 20-something year old actor.

non-heroism,"It's 1939 Warsaw. Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) is a Jew and a pianist on the radio. He falls for Polish girl Dorota. The Germans invade and the Szpilman family expects to live through another war. However, their lives slowly deteriorate as government decrees force them into the Jewish ghetto. Itzak Heller tries to recruit Wlad and his brother Henryk into the Jewish police but they refuse. As his family is put on trains, Wlad is pulled out by Itzak. Wlad joins the resistance and smuggles in material. He sneaks out and finds friends who help to hide him. He witnesses the Germans battling their way into the ghetto from his hiding place. He finds help from Dorota who is now married and pregnant. From his hiding place, he witnesses the start of the Warsaw uprising.Roman Polanski delivers a depiction of a survivor of the Holocaust. He is more or less passive for too long until pushed. He survives due to kindness of others. He does not fight not due some moral stand but rather a lack of proactive heroism. It's a rather disengaging trait although I can see Polanski's point of view. The other annoying aspect is his surprise and constant reaction to the shocking inhumanity. None of this makes him less realistic. In many ways, he's a very human character and flawed not in any evil ways. It doesn't make him an easy, or appealing character. The world is well constructed. The most compelling scene is actually when the family is stuck waiting out in the sun for the train. The train has been done every time but to wait in a holding pen is more unusual. This is a great Holocaust movie but the leading character is unusually not so appealing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
What makes a movie that's relevant to a war bad..,"What makes a war-related movie problematic is when it inaccurately portrays historical events, perpetuates stereotypes, or manipulates emotions to create a false narrative. When filmmakers take liberties with facts, they risk distorting the truth and misinforming audiences. Let's delve deeper into this issue.Firstly, historical accuracy is crucial. War movies often draw inspiration from real conflicts, but they should strive to depict events as faithfully as possible. When filmmakers alter facts for dramatic effect, they risk misrepresenting the sacrifices and struggles of those who lived through those times. Audiences deserve a truthful portrayal, even if it means sacrificing some sensationalism.Secondly, the portrayal of characters matters. In war movies, there's a tendency to simplify complex situations into clear-cut heroes and villains. However, real life rarely adheres to such black-and-white distinctions. A nuanced approach that explores the motivations and inner conflicts of both sides can lead to a more thought-provoking film. When movies demonize the ""bad guys"" excessively, viewers may feel manipulated and lose empathy for the characters.Thirdly, emotional manipulation can backfire. While drama is an essential element of storytelling, excessive emotional manipulation can undermine a movie's impact. When filmmakers intentionally make viewers feel guilty for empathizing with the ""bad guy,"" it risks oversimplifying the moral complexities of war. Instead, a well-crafted film should encourage critical thinking and reflection.Fourthly, war movies should avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes. Whether it's portraying soldiers from a specific nationality or ethnicity in a one-dimensional way or relying on clichés, these choices can reinforce biases. Filmmakers should strive for authenticity without falling into harmful tropes.In conclusion, a war movie becomes problematic when it sacrifices historical accuracy, oversimplifies characters, manipulates emotions excessively, or perpetuates harmful stereotypes. By adhering to these principles, filmmakers can create powerful narratives that honor the past while engaging and educating audiences. 🎥🍿",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

Masterpiece with one flaw,"""The pianist"" by Roman Polanski is a masterpiece that graphically depicts the horror of the Nazi time in occupied countries, especially, of course, for Jews, and gives you a better, for more vivid, idea of how it must have felt for the affected people in those days, more so than any history book. It does so without relishing in unnecessary gore - don't get me wrong, the scenes depicted in the film are harrowing enough, but there are certainly much more graphical accounts of the holocaust and you never feel that the film ""indulges"" in those pictures for the sake of it. But you get a real sense for how, little by little, the Nazi's pulled the rug under the feet of the Jews, making life a bit more difficult for them every day to the bitter end.There are many other good things to say about the film, which are already said so I don't want to repeat this any more. My only problem with this film is like with some other biographies or epic narrative that stretch a period of time, especially if centred around one characters is that there is a certain lack of interpersonal drama here. Szpilman, the main protagonist is the cornerstone of the film but we get to know very little about anyone else in the movie and therefore, we feel that we don't even get to know Szpilman really well, for there is no better way of characterising a human being than through his interaction with others. He doesn't even seem to be close to anyone. He has some family and some admirers but always seems a bit aloof. To the people who save his life, he expresses gratitude but rarely concern, personal interest or asks if he could help.Apart from that, it is a great movie that deserves much of the applause it gets.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

Unlike many reviewers, I have seen many films dealing with the Holocaust. I have not become immune to the subject and frankly, Polanski does start to touch on the horror and the random acts of inhumanity. However, the pianist character left me cold. A man who is almost completely devoid of any character. Neither a hero or a villain, but just a dull, cold fish. He barely shows fear and certainly aside from two moments when he looks upset (family taken off and little boy beaten to death) is robotic. I saw no Oscar performance here, found the constant leaping from subject to subject disorienting and had no time to really get to know anyone in the story but the robot.

Why not a few more minutes of film after the war to learn a bit more about what drove him? What were his darkest thoughts? How he looked back on all of it? How does he now view Germans, Polish people?Of course for Szpilman himself this was an incredible chain of events that led to his survival.

The viewer is just sort of air-dropped into this nightmare. The piano angle was interesting also, but again context lacking as far as the society he lived in. In other words, if you're going to dehumanize the German people, not just the military, show us how it happened. This could have included no more than old footage of Hitler rallies etc and then focused on a typical German family caught up in it all. The movie would have benefited from a prequel showing all this.That said, the movie presents an interesting and creative take on what it would have been like as a persecuted Jew in that war as well as others who died in it. Polanski was very smart I think in casting someone no one would ever mistake for not being Jewish to really bring home the message to the viewer that this person, the pianist, had no place to hide and was like a hunted animal. I recommend this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
The Pianist (2002) Best WWII film?,"Many films involving the Second World War seek to explore the war itself, the direct confrontation and the death of soldiers. However, some others seek to explore the victims of war and how they managed to survive, this is the case with The Pianist. This film develops its characters and story very well, you can notice a clear difference in the protagonist's mentality over time and how he gradually took the war more seriously. Nothing seems forced, wanting to show the viewer in every way how bad the consequences are. Things happen naturally and the deaths are raw, they are not heroic, they are exactly the way they occur in real life. It is one of the best films of the 21st century and one of the best involving the Second World War.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Must see,"It was a very dramatic and true story. There were many hard scenes where I and my wife had really difficulties to digest all this. It was really experienced by the pianist. Congrats to Adrien Brody for this magnificent role and his merit for this great work was the Oscar. Director Roman Polanski who created another masterpiece won also an Oscar. I am happy that it has got totally three Oscars because we should never forget what happened to all the Jewish in the II World War.  8/10.Check this out and I highly recommend you to see the mini-series ""Band of Brothers"".",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
One of my all time favourite movies,"My girlfriend recently asked me to give her. List of my favourite 15 movies of all time. So I did, this film was one of them.It is a true story about a Jewish pianist who struggles to survive over a six year period (1939-1945) during the Holocaust in Poland.Three of those years he forced to live in a ghetto, then the final two years has goes into hiding as the remaining Jewish population is being forced to go to extermination camps.He survives because of the generosity of some trusted non-Jewish friends as they bring him food and medical care.When I look at my list, it is filled with stories about absolute tragedies such as Room with Brie Larson, Theory of Everything with Eddie Redmayne, La Vie en Rose with Marion Cotillard. Perhaps those stories inspire me the most.Regardless, this is a great film, it deserves your attention.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
good,"It's a great movie that shows how bad a person can be when given the opportunity. The movie shows what doesn't tell us anything. It shows that children,people are mercilessly slaughtered for no reason just because they are Jews. And those who do this job enjoy it. I think there is such a monster in all of us, who feels anger towards others who consider ourselves superior. But it is not absent in our human values, pity ,compassion, we all have such feelings.The film is taken from a real event.. The main character is based on the Pianist book written by Szpilman. In this regard, many of the events experienced and shown have been handled first-hand.I watched the first hour of the movie with my mouth open. For a moment, when it really happened, not as a movie, I thought someone stopped and took it on camera, the atmosphere, that environment, the gun scenes, the deaths, the hunger were perfectly reflected.Especially the cruelty of the Jews, the Jews, broke my heart.It's definitely a movie that needs to be watched.

We had to answer questions about the film and all of us got nearly 100% since we loved it so much! It really gave us a deeper look on what happened in the past and we're thankful this film was made as we now take war much more seriously.

This film is not outstanding but..,"I have to agree with a number of comments about this film being somewhat standard and numbing. Indeed much of the film goes by and leaves one in that state. However, the beginning and end do transcend that, which is all to the good. Brody gives a fine performance; the music is beautiful as is the photography and the setting.Unfortunately, the other actors are given short shrift and they are one feels, also capable of giving fine performances,had their characters been more fleshed out. Having seen many of Polansky's films, I must say I don't recognize his artistic style here as I've come to know it over the  years. That in itself is not necessarily a negative, however he has made some gripping films and this one just doesn't quite live up to that standard. There are some fine things about this film and I do not dismiss it, and indeed would recommend it to others with some caveats. The film is rather too long for what it is and could have been 20 minutes shorter with no harm done. The thing that most impressed me about the experience of watching this was that I had just watched another holocaust film, albeit one about the holocaust of Cambodia, The Killing Fields. This film has all the emotional tension after repeated viewings that it had the first time, this is what I wanted from The Pianist but it wasn't there. 'The Killing Fields' conveys the nightmare scene of Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge and shows how it got there. It also shows very well the drama of people being caught up in the maw of evil beyond their ken. Having watched this extraordinary film first, I found myself  feeling a little detached from the plight of those in this film and it felt like nothing in the movie really reached out and grabbed me the way the subject normally would. I would also say that while I felt 'bludgeoned' by the impact of 'Schindler's List', it also did not reach out to me in the way that 'The Killing Fields' does. It seems that while some movies are greater than the sum of their parts, some are less. This one was less and thus somewhat disappointing, albeit still worthy of watching. I give this film 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

I love Adrien Broody (Wladyslaw Szpilman) and his acting, he showed the feelings exactly like being completely alone, hopeless and hated. He lost everything that he had and lived in hiding. He was never a hero but a fighter for living. Near the ending Szpilman discovers the apartment that his latest 'safe house' has a piano. We see Szpilman sit at the piano, we see him shoulders moving, we hear piano music and gasp -- and then we see his hands moving in the air just above the keyboard and realize, with both relief and regret, that the music is only in Szpilman's head.Thanks to the deservedly Oscar-winning work of director Roman Polanski, screenwriter Ronald Harwood and the whole cast.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

A Jewish classic pianist's career was upended in 1940 in Germany because of.....well, we all know the answer to that. This movie's telling of the methodical NAZI takeover and extermination of the Jewish people is brutal and chilling in detail. It portrays the crescendo of evil inflicted upon those people as their rights slowly were stripped away through the eyes of Wladyslaw Szpilman. This sugarcoats absolutely nothing. It sears many horrific scenes into your brain at the lack of any ounce of humanity by the NAZI's.

He had a sex with a wet and willing minor. Who would not? Worse of all they wanted to lock him up for five years, he would serve sentence in the same jail where sentence is serving murderer of his pregnant wife, Manson. USA, helooooooo? What is it with you?

A Haunting Symphony of Survival,"Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"" is a harrowing and poignant exploration of one man's resilience amidst the brutality of war. Released in 2002, this film is a cinematic tour de force, weaving a compelling narrative based on the real-life experiences of pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman during the Holocaust.Adrien Brody delivers an Oscar-winning performance as Szpilman, capturing the vulnerability, despair, and ultimately, the indomitable will to survive in the face of unimaginable adversity. The film meticulously unfolds Szpilman's journey from the height of his musical career in pre-war Poland to his struggle for survival in the Warsaw Ghetto and, later, as a hidden observer of the city's devastation.Polanski's direction is both sensitive and unflinching, immersing the audience in the stark realities of war-torn Warsaw. The film's cinematography by Pawel Edelman paints a haunting portrait of the city's destruction, emphasizing the contrast between the once-vibrant cultural hub and its desolate wartime incarnation.The screenplay, adapted from Szpilman's memoir by Ronald Harwood, avoids sensationalism, offering a nuanced portrayal of human resilience, the randomness of survival, and the moral complexities faced by individuals during such dark times. The pacing allows for a deep emotional connection with Szpilman's character, and the film is a testament to the power of storytelling in conveying the human experience.The score, featuring the haunting compositions of Chopin performed by Janusz Olejniczak, adds a layer of melancholy beauty to the film, complementing the narrative without overshadowing its somber tone.""The Pianist"" stands as a powerful reminder of the atrocities of war and the strength of the human spirit to endure. Its impact is enduring, leaving audiences with a profound sense of reflection and empathy. While not an easy watch due to its intense subject matter, the film's artistry, coupled with Brody's exceptional performance, cements its place as a cinematic masterpiece that resonates long after the credits roll. A rating of 9 reflects the film's excellence in storytelling, acting, and its ability to evoke a deep emotional response.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

I found ""The Pianist"", surprisingly, to be rather lacking in characterisation, and found the soundtrack in Spielberg's work, as well as juxtaposition of colours (with black/white), and use of motif, to be much more powerful and moving than Polanski's.

Survival may simply depend on little effort and the deeds of others.,"Surviving death when it seems inevitable is a great feat, especially when your survival depends largely on the kindness and deeds of others. No one could provide a greater testimony to this than Wladyslaw Szpilman, acclaimed pianist and Holocaust survivor. Wladyslaw and the members of his immediate family would find out first hand how racism and prejudice could destroy a seemingly simple existence. The Pianist is a film about a Holocaust survivor and all the good fortunes that took place in order for him to avoid the same fate as the members of his family - death. Roman Polanski, director of The Pianist, does an excellent job of providing his audience with a sense of being through his use of music and color in a number of scenes throughout this movie.For Wladyslaw music was the means by which he would drift from the reality of his situation and return to some place of peace. When Wladyslaw serenades a German Officer, Wilm Hosenfeld, the emotion and the passion by which he plays implies that he believes this is his last performance. It may be argued that Polanski employs the audience to grasp the true gravity of the Holocaust and all that Szpilman survived when he uses deep focus technique to show the disaster in the foreground and in the distance (miles of death and destruction). I believe that Steven Spielberg uses some of the same filming techniques in his depiction of the Holocaust with his film Schindler's List.As if to keep the audience at a comfortable distance from the characters and the tragedy, Polanski does very few extreme close shots. He tries to keep his audience and his characters at a comfortable distance once the attack on the Jews begins. The lighting is primarily low key to imply a grim existence and not until the end does Wladyslaw color become more vibrant and the lighting around him shift to high key (final scene).The uncertainty, the humiliation, the hurt from losing family members, the resolve of being a survivor and finally the settling in to a new existence are all brought to the surface with Wladyslaw's musical piece at his safe haven for the German Officer, Hosenfeld.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Discrimination of all kinds must end,"THE PIANIST is a film that takes a dark and disturbing subject matter - the persecution of the Warsaw Jews by Nazis in the Second World War - and turns it into a spellbinding, enthralling journey of a movie. Roman Polanski could easily have made this maudlin and sentimental like Spielberg's SCHINDLER'S LIST, but he thankfully avoids that temptation and the result is the much better movie of the two.This film contains a documentary-style realism in its depiction of the various atrocities carried out by the uncaring Germans. It gets dark and darker as it goes on, and yet the viewer is unable to tear his eyes off the screen because it's all so well-realised and realistic. Adrien Brody plays the eyes and ears of the viewer in a subdued manner, yet delivers his greatest and most believable performance as a result. The story has a lot of darkness and violence, but Polanski's expert camera-work and endless style stops the subject matter ever becoming depressing; instead there's enough tension to keep you involved and wanting to find out what's next. Things build to a suitably touching and poignant climax that doesn't disappoint.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

Powerful performances,"Powerful performances. Adrien Brody is very good in this. Well obviously he is, he just won the Best Actor Oscar. I think he can be compared to Tom Hanks in Cast Away- even in scenes of silence there's just something about the actor's movements and expressions that keeps you engaged. There's another scene near the end that defines the entire performance, the entire movie for me: After all the trouble Brody went through trying to survive, he is almost killed by the people who would save him. He is wearing a coat that a German officer had given him earlier, and when Russian troops spotted Brody they thought he was German. They shot at him and almost killed him, but they finally found out he was Polish. The Pianist is certainly a shocking and even depressing film, but like most movies that aspire to provoke thoughts and emotions, the audience takes out of it what they bring in to it. Surely Szpiellman wasn't just a lucky guy who survived in times of inhumane brutality. It was through the kindness and compassion of others who helped him, if only because they found themselves inexplicably moved by his music.My rating: 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

"Without creating melodramatic moments to draw tears from the audience, ""The Pianist"" is a sad film capable of carrying out unimaginable atrocities of human being","The plot is based on the autobiography of Wladyslaw Szpilman (1911-2000), one of the 400 thousand Jews who lived in Warsaw and who were summarily massacred when Germany invaded Poland, in 1939. Confinement of his family and his Polish peers in the city's so-called ""Ghetto"", suffered in the face of racist norms imposed by the Nazi army, escaped the consequent extermination and survived as a dying man in the rubble of the city until the end of World War II, in 1945.Written by Ronald Harwood based on Szpilman's autobiographical book, The Pianist begins precisely at the moment when Germany invades Poland and begins enacting anti-Semitic laws: at first, Jews are prohibited from walking on the city's sidewalks (in this case, Warsaw) and to sit on benches in the squares. They are then forced to wear sashes bearing the Star of David on their arms and are later 'deposited' in the Warsaw ghetto. It is in this context that we meet the pianist's family: cultured and relatively wealthy, the Szpilmans believe that Germany will soon be defeated, since France and England have just declared war on Hitler. Thus, it is with great terror that they end up submitting themselves to the constant humiliations imposed by the Nazis as they fight to remain united - and these humiliations seem to have no end, since the German military seems willing to carry out new atrocities at all times, as in the scene where they interrupt a family's dinner and, to avoid the trouble of carrying an invalid down the stairs, decide to throw him out of the window.Another sequence of scenes depicts the horrors of that time. A boy in despair calls out for his father, who is in his lap, dead for many hours, given the livor mortis already marking his skin. Jews are humiliated in the public square by Nazi soldiers. A boy is saved by the protagonist when trying to cross the ghetto wall, being beaten until he passes out. The worst scene, however, takes place on a night when several Jews are killed without any mercy, leaving their bodies disgraced in the middle of the street. We see Polish Jews being uprooted from their homes, their jobs, and ultimately their own families.The direction of ""The Pianist"", by the way, is exquisite: over the 148 minutes of projection, Polanski manages to perform a feat that is extremely difficult in productions of this type, making the spectator feel the slow passing of the years without, with that, the narrative becoming whether episodic or artificial. And more: by portraying Szpilman's journey, the filmmaker competently illustrates the difficulties he faces to stay alive, since food was a luxury item in times of war - so, whenever he arrives at a new hiding place, the protagonist is obliged to look for something to eat and drink, even if it means plunging your face in a bucket full of human waste.Meanwhile, Adrien Brody gives an absolutely unforgettable performance as Szpilman, embodying with incredible reality the physical and psychological decay of the character over the years: from his initial sophistication to his transformation into the animalistic figure seen at the end of the war. Passive to the extreme, the pianist is not a hero in the usual sense of the word, since his posture in the face of difficulties is never that of someone willing to fight for his ideals or even for his life: throughout the duration of the film, Szpilman is led from one end of Warsaw to the other by friends and allies, but he never questions the plans presented to him. Incidentally, the impression is that the subject keeps himself alive more by inertia than by persistence: when he is trapped for two weeks in an apartment without food, for example, he does not even try to find a way out of the problem, limiting himself to lie down on a couch and agonize until someone comes to help you.Present in virtually every scene of The Pianist, Brody carries the film with impressive strength - and, unlike the character played by Daniel Day-Lewis in Gangs of New York, who draws attention because he is an atypical figure, Wladyslaw Szpilman is an absolutely ordinary man, not having mannerisms or other characteristics that transform him into a unique personality, which certainly made the actor's work even more difficult. Szpilman's loneliness after being separated from his entire family is heartbreaking. He spends much of the film alone, wandering within the confines of the ghetto, fleeing destruction and slaughter and seeking an unlikely salvation. Adrien Brody's interpretation is superb, building a gentle, sensitive character who bravely resists all his misfortune. He relies on the help of friends to survive, but his greatest source of strength seems to be his music. This becomes clear again when he sits at the piano, unable to play it, and his fingers play the notes of Chopin's Grande Polonaise Brilliant in the air. Apart from the physical transformation, the beard, the dark circles under his eyes and the fourteen kilos he lost while preparing for the role, the actor conveys the character's feeling of loneliness with a simple look. It falls to him much of the task of proving to the viewer that the film is not just one of many on the subject.Another scene, possibly the most beautiful in the entire film, occurs when the musician is discovered in his hiding place by a German officer. Upon saying that he is a pianist, the Nazi asks him to play something on the old piano that the place houses. His interpretation of Chopin's tempestuous Ballad No. 1, a work with nuances ranging from melancholy to the densest anger, moves the officer and he decides to help him. Szpilman says everything that needs to be said through his music, and the wandering, almost spectral figure he has become is filled with an impressive vitality as he sits down at the piano to turn pain into music.Technically, the film does as well as it does in its content approach. The locations where the ghetto scenes were filmed were extraordinarily well chosen, including choosing regions of Warsaw that preserved the original wartime architecture. The photograph is dry, hard and makes no attempt, at any moment, to create colors that attenuate the sense of the indescribable catastrophe that is seen. Pawel Edelman's photography helps a lot to compose this scenario of calamity, as well as the total delivery of Brody, who goes through severely different physical phases in the period in which he is pursued, the way the film deals with his level of despair and others impresses men, an artist with the intention of shining is reduced to just a man who seeks to survive, who sneaks through small houses, hunting for crumbs and pieces of bread, crumbs and leftovers from past meals, who finds old loves now with other peers and who doesn't know if he will live another day or if he will find his own again. All this despair is easily translated to those who watch, and Wladek's destiny seems to be to suffer. The war actually only arrives in the final forty minutes, and he is invaded by despair, having the little refuge he had being bombed. The art direction (the work of Sebastian T. Krawinkel) is impressive, carefully recreating the Warsaw ghetto and also the ruins that the city was transformed into throughout the war - and the scene in which Szpilman sees the results of the bombings by the The first time is impressive, since the destruction of Warsaw ends up serving as a reflection of the character's own degradation.Visual effects are used in the right measure, without compromising the film or hiding a lack of ideas. Roman Polanski's direction full of intimacy is also very sober and does not bet on fuss or virtuosity, which would spoil the gravity and strength of his story. It is worth remembering that Polanski's parents were sent to concentration camps during the Holocaust and to deal with the story of Wladislaw Szpilman is to find yourself again with a painful part of your own history.Finally, in addition to the careful reconstruction of the story, the plot has a plot that grows as it unfolds, avoiding the most obvious solutions in order to shed light on the protagonist and the unfolding of events. Adjacent situations, which could serve more as a distraction than an advance, such as the German general who sympathizes with the pianist's drama, already at the end of the war, or even the artist's relationship with his music, end up being wisely circumvented in decisive passages. Thus, his message gains the strength it needs to emphasize its importance and pertinence, making it current and impossible to ignore. The Pianist is a class, of respect, art and life. To be seen, understood and reflected.Without worrying about creating melodramatic moments to draw tears from the audience, ""The Pianist"" is a sad film without, for that, needing to be emotional. The sadness provoked by this story does not come from moments artificially created through the use of the soundtrack or carefully written speeches, but rather from the frightening realization that human beings are capable of carrying out unimaginable atrocities - and the fact that the protagonist of this production is a pianist only adds to this fact, as it sets up a stark contrast between the creative beauty of the Arts and the insane monstrosity of War. On second thought, the protagonist of this film could perfectly well be a filmmaker. And, in a way, it is.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
not that special.,"I really don't see it. What's so great about this movie? I mean when the ghetto is on fire it just looks like crap (for one thing).

"Sadly, I've seen this same story many times before","I'm just going to bite the bullet and say something that is potentially quite ugly and offensive, so I'll apologize in advance for how this makes me sound. I've seen enough of the Holocaust. I know it was probably the ugliest and most horrendous moments in humanity's history. I know that Nazis did unspeakably awful things to Jews. I know that life for anyone Jewish was unbearable, for however long they could keep their lives. But over the years I've seen so many films on the subject, my emotional reserves have been used up. I couldn't muster a tear for Wladyslaw Szpilman's struggle, and almost feel like I've become desensitized to scenes of Jews being carted off to concentration camps or shot in the streets. My brain still sees the horror and hates that this was reality, but my heart has been drowned in similar shots in countless movies to the point where it can't continue to break every time I see it. In fact, I just watched a couple of similar films based on the true stories of Jews fleeing the Holocaust within the last month, so perhaps it was just bad timing.I think the other reason that The Pianist didn't connect with me as well as any number of similar stories is the passive role that Szpilman plays in his own story. In many ways he is merely an observer of what happens. His story is about fleeing, watching, and others helping him. Once his family is removed from the equation, we don't form much of a bond with anyone else we see suffering. I'm not suggesting he did anything wrong, in fact his story is quite impressive. However, when I've seen films about people inside the concentration camps, or forced to endure heinous acts of cruelty, it's hard to be as impacted by a guy who is hiding. I hope this doesn't make me sound too much like a monster, and I certainly didn't hate The Pianist. In fact, I was looking forward to hearing him play more, because the actual music was marvelous. It's impossible to be bored by a movie like this, because there's always some new horrible thing around the corner. I guess my standards for movies in this genre have just been raised too much, and it will take something truly original or outstanding to hit me with the power of Holocaust movies that came before.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
even Horowitz couldn't play the g minor ballade perfectly under those conditions,"I have heard Rubinstein, Ashkenazy, Serkin, Horowitz and Gilels play at the height of their powers, in well-heated concert halls, well fed and surrounded by love and support -- and not one of them ever played, or need to have played, a completely note-perfect concert. It is absolutely not possible that anybody, after four years of not practicing, in air so cold you could see their breath, starving and frightened, hands curled in pain and exhaustion, could play a note perfect rendition of Chopin's G Minor ballade. The scene would have been far more moving if he had given a moving performance in spite of mistakes and slurs and missed passages.

The Pianist,"It was since the time the movie was released and won Oscar I wanted to see this movie. At last I got the time and occasion to see it.The story is about a famous young Polist Jew pianist in Warsaw, Germany during World war II (1939-1944) Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody). The Jews  including his family and he are subjected to atrocities by German army and subjected to move from their palatial upper class living to smaller quarters, and the journey continues till they are boarded to a train leading to gas chamber. Wladyslaw manages to escape the train journey and finds refuge at different places in most trying circumstances. Many a times nearing occasions of death and being caught; Wladysalw survives the War in the end, when he is rescued by the invading Polish army.Director Roman Polaski, who himself is a Polish Jew, had suffered and experienced similar circumstances during WW II. This is one of the most grandeur scale movie the Roman has directed till date. The set are magninomious, and the details of War and its impact on Warsaw city is depicted with utmost reality. The ghetto of Jew neighborhood with a segregating wall in between is chilling, so are numerous scenes when innocent Jews are shown being killed without any reason.Though this is a movie of a pianist, its main theme is to show the world (one more time) the atrocities Jews faced in Germany during WWII. This time  the master is at work. It just happens that the protagonist is a pianist, it could have had been anyone. It does not matter  because the purpose seems evidently clear  to show how Jews suffered during WWII.Adrien Brody does a great job in bringing a real character and his fears, desires to life. He lives the role in body and skin. He acting is a treat to watch.The cinematography is superb. It is obvious the movie must be very well funded.One question that intrigued me throughout the movie was  Why were Jews segregrated and killed by Germans? I tried to google it, and most of the blame goes to Hitler, who wanted to eliminate a few races. I also read that Jews are most arrogant, clever, intelligent and shrewd blood sucking money making machines, who are very mean in their business. I may need to read some what more on this before I can make my own conclusion.There is nothing new or great about the theme, but a good movie by a master Roman Polaski. It surely had to won accolades in US, as Jews rule the business world  especially Hollywood.(Stars 7.5 out of 10)",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Perfect!,"This film is totally amazing. I love it and it's got such fine details or everything in. O.K i don't like seeing people dead in the streets and stuff, but it really was like that and I think Polanski has done an amazing job of making the film of someones personal experiences. I cannot fault anything about this movie and the devotion Adam Brody must have put in to play Chopin is fantastic! Being a musician myself I cannot express how hard and stressful it would have been to learn to do that in such a short time. I think that Roman has made a perfect movie here and there is not one thing that he could do to better it. The quality of the acting from all the cast in particular Adam Brody is absolute perfection. It really makes you think you are there living the nightmare with them, and this is what good films are all about. They make you emotionally attached and I am so glad I was not living in the war. It really makes you look at what you have and feel grateful for what you have been given.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Great,"I loved this film. I also was concerned it was going to be another ""Schindler's List"". I find it difficult to express in words why I disliked Schindlers list. Its not a bad film, in fact it is very well constructed and quite moving. But I guess I just could not escape the feeling that it was begging the audience for sorrow and feelings of guilt. Maybe even commercially trading on the murder of millions of Jews? I felt that it was a one sided political message. Anyway I was worried that the Pianist was going to be of the same ilk. How wrong I was. There are no political overtones, it is simply a stunningly crafted human story of one man's survival through the horrors of Jewish oppression and WW2. The film is tragically beautiful. The soundtrack is haunting, and the acting superb. The story is simple and well crafted and the cinematography is gorgeous.

See the Pianist - Especially Now,"A movie about the atrocities committed during WWII could not be more timely to watch than now, at a time when George Bush is comparing the ""War on Terrorism"" to WWII - odd since depending on what your politics are you might think that lately the US is acting more like the Nazis in this film than the rescuing Russians, with the common people of Afghanistan, Iraq and the US, like the Pianist, being caught in between as the inadvertent, non-politicized victims of the ideological/political war between the government of fascists and fundamentalists. Roman Polanski does a tremendous job of portraying the brutality and ugliness of war, and the beauty of human individuality when mercy, kindness, and love are demonstrated in the face of it.    If all the political leaders with their agendas today were forced to sit in a room and watch this together, I wonder what they would say afterwards about it. Polanski had made a movie that will haunt those who see it forever -- a cinematic revelation that wisely reminds us--""Those who forget the past are condemned to repeat it."" It makes me hope that if perhaps if more love, kindness, mercy and understanding were demonstrated in politics today, we might be able to get further toward global peace.

Everything about this movie looks authentic, with what appears to be a cast of thousands.It is quite inspirational, and the music alone is worth the price of admission.

No Hollywood studio would ever have dared touched this one...,"A film usually is a great film because of the emotion it evokes from the audience. It is usually great because it shows us the 'reality' of life during troubled times. This film does both, and more. Yet, you almost never are moved to anything more than the verge of tears. You don't ever feel sorry for any of the characters including Szpilman. It is extremely existentialist, with a eerie Beckett-esque feel to it through out. The scene of the soup-snatcher and of the old Jew man being thrown off his wheelchair from his balcony high above the pavement couldn't have been written better by Beckett himself. The whole idea of the music playing in your head is so enchanting, yet you don't ever feel depressed but instead smile and hear the music in your own head. The scene of Szpilman playing the piano yet not playing it, is something that will continue to haunt me for a long time. Brody is Szpilman, every character is their own person, no one could have replaced them and none could have done another role. The music pieces are brilliantly chosen from a wide collection of the work that Szpilman played, so is the cinematography. This film would have been so easily about Szpilman's heroic life, instead it's about his music, and his survival to play that music, nothing more, nothing less. It's not about the Jewish cause, it's not about the life of his family members, it's not even about his love story. It's a very rare film. And by the end of the film, you're left with a sense of incompleteness which must have been Szpilman's life but his music seems to fill that void for him and for us as well. I wouldn't say it's a must see, because that would be a term you'd associate with a Hollywood blockbuster, this is a must know.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

WW2,"The Pianist is a powerful and moving biographical war drama film directed by Roman Polanski and starring Adrien Brody as Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish-Jewish pianist who survived the Holocaust in Warsaw. The film is based on Szpilman's memoir of the same name, which recounts his harrowing experiences of hiding, starving, and witnessing the atrocities committed by the Nazis and their collaborators. The film won three Academy Awards, including Best Director for Polanski, Best Adapted Screenplay for Ronald Harwood, and Best Actor for Brody.The film begins with Szpilman playing live on the radio in 1939, when the German invasion of Poland interrupts his performance. He and his family are soon forced to move into the Warsaw Ghetto, where they face hunger, disease, humiliation, and violence. Szpilman manages to escape deportation to the Treblinka death camp with the help of a Jewish policeman, but he loses contact with his family and friends. He then begins a desperate struggle for survival, moving from one hiding place to another, with the aid of some sympathetic Poles and Jews. Along the way, he witnesses the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and the Warsaw Uprising, as well as the brutal suppression of both by the Germans. He also encounters a German officer named Wilm Hosenfeld, who spares his life and helps him find food and shelter.The Pianist is a masterful film that depicts the horrors of war and genocide without sensationalizing or exploiting them. Polanski, who himself survived the Krakow Ghetto as a child, creates a realistic and immersive atmosphere that transports the viewer to the time and place of the events. He also avoids any overt political or moral commentary, letting the images and sounds speak for themselves. The film is not only a testament to Szpilman's courage and resilience, but also a tribute to the human spirit and dignity that can endure even in the most inhumane conditions.Brody delivers an outstanding performance as Szpilman, conveying his emotions and thoughts with minimal dialogue and subtle gestures. He portrays Szpilman's transformation from a confident and talented musician to a broken and terrified man with remarkable authenticity and sensitivity. He also lost 30 pounds for the role, adding to his physical resemblance to Szpilman. The supporting cast is equally impressive, especially Thomas Kretschmann as Hosenfeld, who shows compassion and remorse despite being part of the Nazi regime.The film also features a beautiful and haunting score by Wojciech Kilar, which includes some of Chopin's piano pieces played by Szpilman himself or by Brody. The music adds to the emotional impact of the film, as well as to its artistic value. The cinematography by Pawel Edelman is also stunning, capturing the contrast between the dark and gloomy interiors of the hiding places and the bright and colorful exteriors of Warsaw before and after the war.The Pianist is a film that deserves to be seen by anyone who appreciates cinema as an art form and as a medium for telling stories that matter. It is not only a historical document, but also a universal story of survival, hope, and humanity.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

Polanski's Best?,"This is debatable, but The Pianist may be the best work Roman Polanski has ever done -- although this may be one of his most un-Polanski-like films. Unlike Chinatown, Rosemary's Baby and The Ninth Gate, here evil eventually has to give way in the face of good.The film is also timely.  There has been in recent years an upswing in anti-Semitism.  Jewish studients in US and Canadian colleges report verbal and physical abuse by faculty and other students.  European nations ignore the rise of anti-Jewish violence in their own countries.  Arab press and websites praise Hitler, deny the Holocaust and call for a war of genocide against Jews. (How can one both praise Hitler and deny the Holocaust is beyond me, but I have read the articles!)The Pianist is based on Wladyslaw Szpilman's autobiography.

No Schindler's List,"No one can deny the utter horrors of WWII against Europe's Jewish population and it is an important history lesson that should never be forgotten. Nevertheless, not all of the stories from this era translate very well into film and this is no exception. Polanski is so full on with the horrors that many of them fall into cliché and the result is that there is no emotional response left from the viewer for the rest of the film. For example, there's a woman who's had to kill her baby (how on Earth would they know?), there's a man who eagerly scoffs food of the filthy ground..and so on.. It seemed Polanski felt the need to cram in far too much. For heaven's sake he even crow-barred in Shylock's line from Merchant of Venice about being Jewish AND being human at the same time; how 'convenient' that the pianist's brother had the play on him! Nevertheless, there were some painfully wonderful moments such as when the pianist is in hiding in a room with a piano which he isn't allowed, for obvious reasons, to play. You have to see the moment to appreciate it. Unfortunately it is a moment which is all too rare. The part at the end, where he is made to play by a German officer would have been much more emotionally charged if we felt that this officer was a genuine threat. In summary, this film is too crammed with misdirected emotion to be as tear-jerking as Schindler's list.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Polanski's best,"Roman Polanski's The Pianist, one of the best films of 2002, has a singular, almost claustrophobic view of the Holocaust in Poland.  Where Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List was notable for its scope, its expansiveness, The Pianist views every atrocity through the eyes of one man, the celebrated Polish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman, whose memoir provided the material for the film.  What he sees, and what he becomes during the Nazi occupation of Poland, is at the heart of this inward-looking classic.The film begins in 1939, while Szpilman is playing a polonaise -- the most Polish of musical compositions -- for Polish radio.  German bombs begin to explode outside the studio; a final one literally blows Szpilman off of his piano bench.  His primary reaction to the interruption of his playing is annoyance: like his fellow Jews in Warsaw, he has no idea of the horrors to come.The horrors that do come, come slowly.  First, Jews are banished from upscale eating establishments and city parks; then they are required to wear an insignia of the Star of David, identifying them immediately.  For Szpilman, however, protected by his fame as a musician, these progressively demeaning acts have little significance: like the bombs near the radio station they are annoyances, indignities that can be tolerated.It's difficult to imagine how they could be brushed aside so easily, but we are reminded that they are imposed over a period of time.  With time as a shield it's possible to live in denial, casting a blind eye to the growing dehumanizing of the Jews, as well as Gypsies and other ""undesirables.""Finally, however, there can be no more possibility of denial.  The Warsaw ghetto is constructed, and it is gradually populated by all the Jews in the city, packed together in subhuman conditions.  Not long afterward, the undesirables begin to be taken to the trains leading to the death camps.Up to this point, Szpilman has been hardly more than a casual onlooker, but it becomes clear that his celebrity will no longer protect him or his family.  Having disdained the offer to become a Jewish collaborator, he is pulled back from a train leading to Treblinka by a collaborator who admires his music.  The rest of his family go to the camp, where they all die.From this time, Szpilman lives through the war in solitude, shuffled from safe house to safe house thanks to the desperate heroics of the Polish Underground: once again, his musical genius has saved him where so many perished.  The austerity of his life is heartbreaking.  He can only watch through a window as the vainglorious Warsaw ghetto uprising occurs and is brutally put down.  One of his safe houses is directly across the street from a Warsaw hospital that has been commandeered by the Germans; watching the hospital through a window, he learns that the war on the Russian front is going from bad to worse.Although the physical aspects of his life hardly change from day to day, routinely tedious and necessarily silent, Szpilman's inner life undergoes a metamorphosis.  At the beginning of the movie we see him sporting the cool arrogance of his social stature.  As time passes, he is turned almost solipsistically inward, finally becoming little more than a passive observer, who allows the circumstances of his world to enter in, but has gradually lost the capability to project himself outward.  He has seen too much; he has heard far too little, especially of his beloved music.Szpilman's transition requires the most deftly understated of acting performances, and Brody delivers an unbelievably touching portrait of a man regressing from an upper-crust social existence to a life parceled out in the tiniest of morsels -- not only of food, but of human companionship. Polanski's deliberately narrow vision is the perfect vehicle for viewing this life: there's no artifice, and there's nothing remotely hinting at melodrama.  The Germans go about their business of execution and capricious slaughter coldly and efficiently: in one scene a group of German soldiers make their Jewish prisoners dance to their bullets; in another, the soldiers drop a wheelchair-bound man from an upstairs balcony before marching the remaining Jews in the room downstairs to be shot.  Polanski depicts the horrors with a cold eye: a Holocaust survivor himself, he is painfully aware that the Holocaust had very few heroes, and most often survival was the best that could be hoped for.The film's defining moment occurs with the Russians at the gates of Warsaw. Szpilman, foraging for food in a bombed-out town house, encounters a German captain (Thomas Kretschmann).  Fortuitously, there is a piano in the house. When the captain asks Szpilman what he is doing, he replies that he is a musician.  ""Play something,"" the captain orders.  Szpilman does, beautifully as ever.  The captain is moved, offers his overcoat, and returns more than once with food.It's difficult to adequately explain the subtlety and the power of this scene.  It captures not only the arbitrariness of Szpilman's existence, but also the moral ambivalence of the Holocaust itself.  Once again, Szpilman's musical talent has saved him.  His survival is a matter of luck rather than heroism.  We see as he is playing that he is literally playing for his life, and it is only his good fortune to have been discovered by a music lover who appreciates his talent.On a higher level, the concert is a morality play whose subject is how the sentimental, music-loving Germans could have perpetrated such horrors as Szpilman has witnessed during his years in hiding.  There is no excusing their evils, only wonderment at how it all could have happened in the first place.  To Polanski's credit he doesn't offer an answer to this vexing question.  Very likely, like almost all of us he has none.This doesn't mean that he doesn't make the effort: this is a brutal film, whose imagery shows with a grim meticulousness how cruelly human beings can treat other human beings.  But it is also a film about hope, and about the almost-inexhaustible tenacity of the human spirit.  Wladyslaw Szpilman came as close to being broken as it is possible to be, yet he survived, not with flourishes or heroics, but with a simple, amazing resilience of will. This is certainly one lesson about the Holocaust that needs to be remembered.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
unforgettable. beautiful. heartbreaking.,"This is one film that i simply can-not forget, as much as i may want to forget some of the traumatising and absolutely horrendous scenes showing us the brutality, i can't: and that's what is so haunting about this film, and the main point of this film to be honest, the scenes showing us the horrific brutality that innocent people went through SHOULD stick with us, so that we are aware of how much pain innocent people had to go through, hence why i'd describe this film as unforgettable.This film had been sat in my watchlist for months, i knew that it had great reviews but i had assumed that it would be one of those films that only show you half of what had actually happened, or one of those films that focus too much on their own storyline but not on the reality, and when i watched the film, i realised how incorrect i was, this film was so haunting and chilling, and the acting left me with goosebumps and in a flood of my tears.An unforgettable film, very emotional but breathtakingly chilling.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

Best holocaust movie!,"As a holocaust survivor I was particularly moved by Polanski'srealistic picture of life and death in the Warsaw ghetto.  The only flaws I noticed were in the German uniforms: soldiers did not routinely wear brand-new shiny helmets (with little swasticas) in the cities;  they usually wore soft army hats. There was no distinction in  the movie between Wehrmacht (army) and SS. The SS uniforms (at least the officers') were black. Their caps had a skull and crossbones on it. And towards the end of the war characters like Capt. Hosenfeld were not uncommon.  I ran into several Wehrmacht (not SS) characters running from the Russians, who were sympathetic and could barely wait for the war to be over.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

Brody is just amazing here, losing a ton of weight and just captivating as his family is rounded up and shipped off to the Nazi labour camps and he escapes, spending years living in the ruins of Warsaw.Adrien Brody won best actor Oscar for his role, I was just remembering his Oscar speech, its really amazing too, you might remember him kissing Halle Berry. 08.11 (2)",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Superb movie,"Truly excellent movie, better than ""Schindler's List"" in my opinion. The fact that you can see the horror of the holocaust through the eyes of a normal family makes everything more believable. Polansky wisely decided not to include a love story (not even hinted at)and the Warsaw ghetto looks exactly like you can see on the history books. Superb acting and directing, some scenes of this movie you will probably never forget: after being arrested by the SS, a group of jews stands in line and are told to be ready to move. ""Where are you taking us?"" a woman asks shyly. The answer is a bullet through her head, shot by the SS officer Whenever the SS raid a house, you are actually inside the house yourself, looking for a way to escape...

Different than what I expected:  Spoilers,"Reviews of ""The Pianist"" had led me to expect that Adrien Brody's real life character, Wladyslav Szpilman, had survived the Holocaust because the Nazis valued him as an entertainer. Strictly speaking, that is true in the sense that one particular high-ranking Nazi hears him play near the very end of the film and does not betray him. However, the film is mainly about the Szpilman's survival within the Warsaw ghetto, his escape from the ghetto while the dispatch of Jews to the death camps is underway, his existence in hiding with the help of a Polish couple, the destruction of much of Warsaw by the Nazis during the uprising and, penultimately, his retreat back to the ghetto to hide until the Russians arrive. In short, 99 percent of the film has absolutely nothing to do with Nazi patronage and the 1 percent is the mercy extended to him because of his talent by a single Nazi commander. It is nonetheless a brilliant film, and Adrien Brody certainly deserves all the praise he received for his role as Szpilman. However, because of his unsavory reputation in the U.S., Roman Polanski received insufficient attention as the director of this film. Polanski's achievement is at least equal to Brody's and I believe that he would have received an Oscar if he weren't persona non grata in the U.S. and in Hollywood.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

So over-rated...,"Simply put, I was NOT impressed by this movie.  For as much hype as it got, I expected a well done, bleak and depressing, nazi era film.  Well it wasn't.The characters are cut outs of the traumatized people we are supposed to feel intimate with.  The storyline moves along too fast, and we get no chance to develop an attachment to anyone.  It's as if Polanski assumes we will automatically feel a sadness and connection to anyone persecuted by the Nazi's.  Well in real life, of course.  It's as if we are hurried along just so the director can get us to the point in the movie where we watch Adrian Brody's character suffer, starving and freezing.  None of the relationships felt authentic, but they had all the trappings to make them look that way.By the end of the film I was left feeling like there could have been so much more.  I don't think I missed the point on this one.  So many people fell head over heels for this film, but personally I think it's a shallow love affair.  And yes, I probably sound angry.  That's because I was hoping this film would be all that it seemed.  You won't really be wasting your time seeing it, and you might like it, but it's not a gut-wrenching depiction of Nazi-era cruelty.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
I'm short of words for this film. A real Gem!,"My second review. The first being Chinatown it is evident that I'm an ardent fan of Roman Polanski. It is a textbook made film, but let's look at it this way. The Pianist is divided into three parts wherein the character development takes place in the end. The first part is when the pianist is in a highly impressive state and is made familiar with the happy tunes that he plays in that part. This is probably the best setup I've ever seen in any of the films. While the atrocities of World War 2 play in the film the character formation still takes place which is easily visible. The second part transits itself well with the first, when the pianist is separated from his family which is one of the best obstacles put by Roman Polanski. Here, the trauma and the hardships increase changing the piano tunes dramatically well. The sympathy with the character is felt every time there is a cruelty in a war happening. Typical Roman Polanski, isn't it? The third and the last stage of character formation is again the total sympathy with the protagonist, but here the development of character is his efforts to survive the war which is not evident in the first part. Brilliant Screenplay, classic piano pieces and their use in the film in the right context. Great acting by Adrian Broody. No wonder he received an Oscar for his brilliant role. Excellent footage editing and use of supers in the film. Unusual start with the black and white footage transforming to the first shot of the film where Adrian broody is playing a piano. Watch this film 2 times, that may really give justice to the film. A real gem! A salute to Roman Polanski! A 10/10.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Seen by accident ....,"We had a chance to see either 'Chicago' or 'The Pianist', and how fortunate we were to have chosen the latter.  Having seen most of the well-known Holocaust films, this one is unsurpassed.  The viewer cannot help but get caught up in the atmosphere, and I found myself virtually living the part played so perfectly by Brody.  With the abominable treatment being handed out by the aggressors going from bad to worse, one felt desperate for some sympathy or an act of kindness to come out of somewhere.  Eventually, we were not disappointed.              The discerning film watcher's experience will remain incomplete until this masterpiece has been seen.

Long Time Coming,"This is what you wait for if you're a movie buff. An eagerly anticipated film that gets great reviews and a number of awards across the Northern Hemisphere...that is actually worth waiting for. And if said film happens to be made by a personal favourite director ('Rosemary's Baby,' 'Chinatown' & 'Repulsion') fallen on hard times ('Pirates,' 'Frantic' & ugh 'Bitter Moon') so much the better.What I really liked about this film was the wonderful simplicity with which Polanski tells the story, while at the same time displaying his mastery of cinematic technique. Much like the pianist of the title, he hits the right notes throughout; from the opening scene where Germans bomb the radio station where he is performing, through the tribulations of his Jewish family, to the 'Schindler's List'-esque Warsaw ghetto scenes and on to the final grim struggle for survival, this is a tour-de-force for the aging director.The plot builds steadily to the final section of the film, where the pianist wanders, frightened and shaking, among the ruins of a bombed and burning Warsaw, still trying to dodge the few retreating Germans still in the city. He is finally caught by one, a general, in the ruins of a formerly grand house...a scene that is sure to go down as a classic.I saw this film on the day it opened in Australia and the cinema was packed. There were the usual packed-cinema sounds; coughing, munching of chips, slurping of drinks, muted conversation. By the time the film had reached it's devastating conclusion, the cinema was silent...high praise for any film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

I usually don't enjoy movies like this, like Schinldlers list i though was boring. This movie, was not boring. I think it was the way that i felt like i was the main character.

The Moral Neutrality of Music-Survival Through Music,"Roman Polanski has created an extraordinary pastiche of one of the darkest chapters of Western history and the nadir of Polish communal life.  ""The Pianist"" follows, achingly and closely, the struggle to live of Warsaw piano virtuoso Wladislaw Szpilman.  The pianist is played by Adrien Brody who seems to have inhabited his character's body and soul. An incredible, indelible performance.Before Germany sent its legions into Poland on 1 September 1939 Szpilman and his family lived a comfortable bourgeois life in a Warsaw in which an endemic, genteel anti-Semitism rarely intruded into the safe world of the Jewish intelligentsia.  Szpilman enjoyed success both as a concert hall and radio performer.  Indeed the very bombs of a Luftwaffe raid forced him to flee the studio as Warsaw was reduced to submission.Rampant anti-Semitism emerged with the occupying German forces finding little need to whip Poles into paroxysms of previously barely sublimated hatred.  Decrees forbade Szpilman and all Jews from even the simple pleasure of sitting on a park bench.  Of course such restrictions were as nothing when all the Jews were ordered into a newly created ghetto, an area of Warsaw that could not possible accommodate the influx of uprooted families with any degree of acceptable sanitation or simple decency.Even worse was to come as Polanski unflinchingly shows both planned and random acts of German homicidal depravity, aided and abetted by Jewish police armed only with truncheons and the ephemeral and decidedly temporary power allowed by the Germans. The violence depicted is sickening, realistic and necessary to the story.Szpilman is saved from transport to a death camp right at the Umschlagplatz (the rail departure point) by a supervising Jewish police accomplice of the Germans.  His family, shoved into a cattle car, departs, never to be seen by him again.  All were murdered - father, mother, brother, two sisters.Szpilman's solo odyssey begins when he knows that he must escape the ghetto where plans for an uprising are slowly jelling.  To Polanski's credit Szpilman's desire to escape and live rather than fight the enemy to the death is presented non-judgmentally.  Szpilman in the film and in his book upon which it is closely based waxes with occasional fits of ambiguous feelings but, overall, his will to live, perhaps fueled by his single-minded desire to play the piano again, controls.  Who has the right to judge him?One desperate situation after another leaves an emaciated and fever-racked Szpilman, kept alive by Poles who detest not only Hitler's brutes but the obscenity of murderous anti-Semitism.Nearly at the end of his rope he is discovered by a German Wehrmacht (Army) captain who asks his occupation.  The officer motions him to a beat up and out-of-tune piano to prove his skill.  Upon doing so, Hauptmann Hossenfeld, somewhat blandly played by Thomas Kretschmann, succors the weak pianist with food and clothing. Hosenfeld purportedly aided other Jews but in the film it seems that if Szpilman didn't turn out to be a pianist, the officer at the least would not have helped him.Szpilman survives for the liberation of Warsaw by the Red Army and he resumes a brilliant career as a pianist, composer (of pop songs too) and member of a chamber music ensemble that tours Europe and the U.S. He died at age 88 two years ago.There is no false sentimentality in this film.  The violence of the Germans is in the viewers face and gasps from the audience were heard today more than once.Szpilman as a fine artist had no greater right to survive than any other Jew.  But his success, visibility, ability to write and commitment to tell his story made his escape from the death-dealers of the Third Reich well-known.  Supposedly, over a million Poles have seen this movie to date. That is good for while the Polish nation was marked down as inferior by Hitler and while much death and privation was visited on Poland the sad reality is that very many more Poles accommodated the occupiers than hid and fed the desperate Jews.  And too many in Poland  today deny the extent of both the Holocaust and the willing assistance of Poles in its execution.Some have suggested that the music of Chopin, Bach and Beethoven which is part of the film is really simply a leitmotif to the story of an individual's will to live.  I don't agree.  For Szpilman, music was a counterpoint to Nazi brutality, a living heritage that he could not allow to be silenced by the conquerors.Music is, of course, morally neutral by itself.  Szpilman's deep love of music is easily matched by the knowledge and devotion to Bach and Beethoven by one of the greatest monsters of the Nazi regime, Heydrich.  What is important, as Polanski proudly and powerfully shows, is that those who are decent and who love music must win out if culture is to have meaning and relevance.I was bothered by one aspect of the film and I'm curious if any others were too.  A roiling debate over the past four or so years in Germany and to a lesser degree amongst American historians is the issue of the role played by the Wehrmacht, the Army, in actually committing crimes against humanity. For decades many Germans have argued that the soldiers more or less were at worst bystanders rather than initiators and principal perpetrators.  That role was assigned to the black-uniformed SS.In this film, virtually every murderer and abuser wears the ""feldgrau"" army uniform BUT in the end credits all are identified as SS personnel, save one: Hauptmann Hosenfeld.  This is curious.The mounting evidence is that the army committed very many atrocities in Eastern Europe against Jews and subjugated peoples.Roman Polanski's stunning vision of his native Warsaw is a haunting classic that will inform future generations of sober and stunned viewers. Polanski has performed a deed of epic moral hygiene in bringing Szpilman's saga to the screen.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Polanski's dormant talents blossom in this screen adaptation,"Mr. Polanski has been investigating other realms for a few years now, with some head-rearing during The Ninth Gate and Bitter Moon, though the grand genius has been muffled in those tales. Here, Mr. Polanski's unique cinematic vision erupts in dangerous imagery as only he can bring it to the screen. The scene where the man in the wheelchair is thrown from the window loudly echoes Trelkowski's fall(s) in The Tenant. Polanski functions at his best when working with an 'outsider' tale and here has a protagonist who is an outsider in every sense, from the first frame to the last. Alone in the studio with his piano, a sole individual inside his tight family, and alone in Warsaw, Adrian Brody's portrayal of Wladislaw Szpilman's true outsider offers Polanski the method to achieve his strong telling of the solitary individual. I will never forget the bent-over death contortions of the female fighter in the streets, Brody's pain at losing him family on a train bound for Treblinka. Mr. Polanski, thank you for your work, and for your dynamic telling of a little-understood period of history. Bravo!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

"Absorbing, but overrated","I was expecting a lot more from this film, and I don't think my impression of it was degraded by the high claims made of it. While it was an atmospheric, impious piece I didn't think it was as good as people are saying here. Brody's performance did what the role required, he displayed fear and so on quite effectively, but felt his character lacked any subtlety. One moment he's a panicked but handsome man, then he suddenly falls ill, grows a beard, and becomes a stumbling wreck. And then everything goes back to normal.Furthermore, the portrayal of the brutality going on around Szpilman, I felt, was nothing special. Of course the wanton disregard for life, the lining of of people to be shot and so on are all very moving topics, and the camera angles through broken windows and so on worked very well, but I can't see how people think this film's portrayal is so superior.It's definitely worth watching, but it's pretty straight-forward.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
This movie was an insult,"What was the motivation behind making this movie?Was it to teach people about the crimes that the Nazis committed in WWII? Probably not, The Pianist came out in 2002, so there were already hundreds of movies out there that depicted the Holocaust.In my opinion, if you want to do another Holocaust movie, it should be because of one of two reasons: 1.) You want to tell a really interesting story that happens to be set in this time and location. Or 2.) you want to do a character study. Maybe show both sides of the medal, and try to analyze what could make people do horrible things like this.The Pianist was neither of those two. The plot is as simple as it gets, a Jewish musician tries not to get killed and to flee from the Nazis. That's pretty much it. So what we get is basically a loosely connected series of scenes, where 1-dimensional Nazis do terrible things to 1-dimensional Jews. It's very important to understand, that there are psychological mechanisms behind what the Germans did in WWII. If you just depict them as flat monsters who just love to do horrible crimes, the viewer just thinks ""Yeah well, I could never do stuff like that."" Guess what, under the right circumstances, you could. There are two German movies about that subject matter, called ""Das Experiment"" and ""Die Welle"". Watch them if you haven't seen them.The characters being as flat as they are also makes it hard for me to get invested in their fate. Don't call me heartless, I'm just complaining about the way the movie was made, I'm not saying I don't care about the real people this happened to.And this brings me back to my opening question of why this movie was made, and to what made it an insult for me instead of just a bad movie. The Holocaust is a sensitive issue for many people, so it's not hard to touch something in the viewer by just showing Nazi crimes. And the people who made this movie knew that. The Pianist had ""Oscar"" written all over it, and because it neither tells an unusual story, nor explores the characters, that's just what the movie is: A cheap way to win everyone involved an Oscar. And they use a horrible event where real people died to do that. That's what makes it insulting for me.It's competently made, it's not ""terrible"" to watch or anything, but the circumstances make me hate The Pianist instead of just discarding it as another movie I didn't care for.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

I've seen a lot of WWII movies and this and Schindler's List are the best, so far.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Breathtaking,"It's rare to see a film of such quality. Polanski has been directing marvelous films for decades, with effective editing and his seemingly unique cinematography. When a brilliant director goes to work on a very personal project, it is almost invariably a certainty that their heart and soul will be put into making it. When a film is made about a major historic event, in particular when countless films have been made regarding it already(and one would be quite hard pressed to find an event that has had more films made about it than World War 2), it needs to make a point or to offer something that we have yet to see. A new perspective, an idea that hasn't been explored before. Benigni gave us Life Is Beautiful(La Vita é Bella), which had one such idea, a beautiful, sweetly naive one. Polanski offers another, one that is at least as heart-warming and life-affirming. He brings the history to life, and does so with such effective direction that the film holds you in an iron grip. You feel compelled to refrain from watching more, yet you cannot look away. Such pain, horror and despair is depicted without flinching, without holding back, without censoring the worst parts out. You see all the cruelty of the Nazis, the degeneration of the health, lives and dignity of the Jews, and the slow but inevitable destruction of Warsaw. All from Szpilman's point of view. That was part of what made this so strong and affecting; he was there. Every single one of these situations, countless of times that he could have been killed... he was there. And at the end of it all, when you hear this man's beautiful music being played, one can't help but think; if war, hate and the rest of the world's evils are a result of the flaws of human beings... then the fact that this man, this creative being, this artist, made it through seemingly impossible odds, and came out of so many potentially lethal situations alive, must surely be proof that in spite of aforementioned evils, in spite of how hopeless it all may seem at times... there is still hope and beauty. It may be beaten down, it may be injured, but it shall never truly perish. The plot is well-written, and develops nicely throughout. The pacing is perfect, there's not a boring or overly fast moment to be found. The effects and design are flawless, it's all extremely authentic and realistic, as are most of the scenes. The cinematography is amazing. As my father commented while we watched: ""You really feel like you are him(Wladyslaw)."" A beautiful film, that takes you through arguably the worst historic event of the latter half of the previous century. I recommend this very highly to anyone who believes that they are strong enough to sit through it. It's most definitely not pleasant. Not to be missed. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
One man's struggle for survival; one people's tragic history; one story about war and humanity- an all-time masterpiece,"Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) was a renowned Jewish pianist in Poland. As the Second World War broke out, Jews were forced to move to the Jewish ghetto. Later, Szpilman's family were sent to a concentration camp but he managed to escape, and his hiding began. He went through fear of being found, starvation, thirst and any horror you can imagine. He survived. He once again worked for Polish Radio and became a soloist, and regained his human dignity.The true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman is intense and poignant, the film itself is outstandingly directed by the brilliant Roman Polanski (Chinatown) and he realised Adrien Brody's amazing potential. Brody's performance is simply stunning, just perfect. Captain Wilm Hosenfeld (Thomas Kretschmann) as the surprisingly sympathetic Nazi officer who, not only did not arrest Szpilman, but was so overwhelmed when listening to him play the piano, as though Captain Hosenfeld at long last heard the most wonderful sound, not the sound of bombs and gunfire, and gave Szpilman food and his coat. This other side of one Nazi soldier was just astounding. It's all about humanity.Being a survivor of the Holocaust, Roman Polanski vividly depicted the era of mass destruction and genocide in the motion picture, the scenes are truly graphic and yet downright realistic, therefore shocking in every way. Adrien Brody also has Polish ancestry and he made Szpilman once again come to life. The movie itself is splendidly made, and words simply cannot describe the impact it has made upon me. Polanski and Brody are absolutely triumphant. This is even better than 'Schindler's List', in some people's opinions. I give this film 10/10. Do not miss it.P.S.

"Based on a true story, The Pianist recounts the experiences of Wladislaw Szpilman, a brilliant Jewish concert musician in Poland during World War II.","Based on a true story, The Pianist recounts the experiences of Wladislaw Szpilman, a brilliant Jewish concert musician in Poland during World War II. Szpilman's extraordinary story of persecution, family tragedy and, ultimately, survival is brilliantly rendered in what is arguably one of Roman Polanski's greatest achievements as a film-maker. The Pianist does not flinch from re-creating the appalling horror of what happened to Polish Jews in the Warsaw ghetto, or avoid their eventual fate in the Nazi concentration camps. Nevertheless, this is not a dramatised documentary or a grim history lesson, instead The Pianist focuses very much on Szpilman's personal journey and what we see and feel is through his eyes. More by luck than good judgement, he becomes a fugitive and escapee in occupied Warsaw, where his terror and isolation are only offset by the help of friends and his memory and belief in the music he has performed. Adrien Brody (Bread and Roses, Summer of Sam) has already received considerable critical acclaim for his mesmerising performance as Szpilman and he is ably abetted by an impressive ensemble cast. British writer, Ronald Harwood, provides a sensitive and measured script; Pawel Edelman's photography provides luminous, unsentimental images and, of course, there is the music which is a major character within the film, setting tones and atmosphere. Above all, though, this is a Roman Polanski film and, considering his own World War II experiences in the Krakow and Warsaw ghettos, this may be his most personal and heartfelt film. Certainly, The Pianist is one of Polanski's most perfectly realised movies and, deservedly, won the Palme d'Or at this year's Cannes Film Festival.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

A Jewish musician trying to survive the German occupation of Warsaw,"Released in 2002, ""The Pianist"" is Roman Polanski's account of the real-life Hebrew pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) whose family was banished to the Warsaw ghetto with thousands of other Jews after the German invasion.

He's dependent on others while hiding out and, like they say, sometimes help comes from the most unexpected sources.Like 1993's ""Schindler's List,"" ""The Pianist"" is a thoroughly realistic WWII drama that addresses the Holocaust with flashes of violence and atrocities, only marred by the stereotypical boorish depiction of practically every member of the Wehrmacht. Needless to say, you have to be in the right mode for a movie like this and you have to be willing to invest a solid hour before things get interesting; by the final hour you'll be hooked until the end; that is, unless you have ADHD and consume only cartoony ""blockbusters.""Some have complained that Szpilman's a lousy protagonist for this type of movie because he never does anything heroic and essentially waits it out. Answer: That's why it's called ""The Pianist"" and not ""The Warrior Jew"" or ""Rambo 5: Kraut Killer."" He was a simple musician who did what he could to survive, but that's not all he does; he also smuggles weapons into the ghetto, which are used later in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. When he eventually hides out in various apartments he doesn't have a weapon. What's he supposed to do, run into the streets and take on German soldiers by himself with a club or a kitchen knife? Even going out with a machine gun would've been foolish and suicidal. Szpilman's a survivor who does some minor heroic things. For those who demand a more standout hero, look no further than Captain Wilm Hosenfeld (Thomas Kretschmann); he's the hero of the story.The movie effectively shows the pianist's view of the war, which is the window through which the viewer observes the historical events. ""Schindler's List"" shows the Holocaust through the eyes of a Gentile who observes the machinery of the Holocaust from the top and views both Nazis and Jews from a position of safety. Oskar Schindler naturally had a more panoramic, birds-eye view of the Holocaust whereas ""The Pianist"" shows the Holocaust through the eyes of a Jew who observes the machinery of the Holocaust from the bottom and sees both Nazis and Jews from a position of danger. The former is a better film for understanding the machinery of the Holocaust while ""The Pianist"" is a better film to watch if you want to know what it was like to experience the Holocaust first hand as an ordinary Jew.The movie runs 2½ hours and was shot in Poland (including Warsaw where the events in the movie take place) and Germany.GRADE: B+",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
I stop watching the movie after 5 minutes,"I want my 5 minutes back!.The same old (...) let's say ""thing"". In a middle of the war, he continue to play on the piano, when in real life, a ordinary person will run like a dog race. He even give as a smile on the staircase when he meet that lady, while behind him the bomb explodes. ""how touching""! lol don't care about the rest of the movie, i had enough.

Heartbreaking portrait of survival in the face of evil; brilliant on all counts,"THE PIANIST (2002) **** Adrien Brody gives the performance of his career as brilliant pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish Jew, who miraculously survived the aftermath of the Nazis' relentless takeover of the Warsaw ghetto, where he hid for years and ultimately the only surviving member of his doomed family, at the height of WWII in Europe.  Filmmaker Roman Polanski delivers his most intimate and compelling work in years (Polanski himself is a Holocaust survivor who experienced intense loss) filtering his own life experiences into his dogged protagonist with all-too painful and assertively unflinching portrait of an exceptionally gifted musician in an unending nightmare replete with graphic violence that comes without warning, hope in the least likely forms and ultimately triumph in the face of evil. One of the best films about the Holocaust and one of the best films of the year as well.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
And the award for best picture goes to...,"... Chicago. Oh dear. What a travesty. 2003 continued the trend for the politics to rule the Academy Awards, giving the most prestigious gong to the boring Chicago over this, possibly Polanski's last great masterpiece. Not that he won't make more films, but that this is his finest since Chinatown, a genuine return to form. And with the current stigma against him in the US, he had to seek out funding from four (count them) countries to ensure this worthy, important film got made.It is the kind of story which has it all - heartbreak, loss, love, death, prejudice, malice, violence, hope, despair, humour and triumph. And that is because it is the story of a man, a real man. An acclaimed, well-known Polish pianist, Wladyslaw Szpilman is our guide to the ghettoisation and subsequent extermination of the Warsaw Jews in World War II, evading capture because of his connections, but watching his family go to die. He survives by joining the Jewish uprising, then hiding in apartments and then ruins in war-torn Warsaw, fleeing from conflict, an outsider watching the dehumanisation of his kin from the inside.Comparisons between this and the earlier Schindler's List are obvious, particularly in the early evacuation scenes, but rather than one being better than the other, they are merely companion pieces, each approaching different aspects of similar material, shot through with restraint, respect and brilliance. However, while the facts of Schindler's life are open to question, this feels much more real. Szpilman's position is purposefully ambiguous - while he is a man stuck in a desperate situation, seemingly doomed if he does not act, he does not have the bravery others have to stand up and fight. Indeed, at times it seems he dismisses the brutality of others to pursue his own ends - such as when his brother is arrested - but this is merely because there is the sense that everyone is doomed, and if you stop to help someone less fortunate, you may forfeit your own life. His bravery comes instead from his sheer refusal to give up and become a number, another Jewish corpse. By the closing act of the film, you come to realise that he was a man who had respect and a career, even prominence, stripped of everything - his dignity, his clothes, his home, his family, even food - but finding a way to survive, until it blows over and he can once again play the piano. By the end, it seems that this is the only place where he succeeds as a person - he did not relate well to members of his family, he has no lover, he passes from person to person, in passing friendships. But when he plays the piano, people listen and he can express all those things that he otherwise could not in life.This is by far the most handsome film Polanski has made, every shot filled with detail and beauty in one form or another. Sticking to his ideal of only putting the camera where best to view any given scene from, there is no visual baggage or fancy editing at work, simply old-fashioned, straightforward, immersive storytelling. By shooting from a detached point of view - many scenes looking down on action in the streets below, or through cracks in blasted windows and roofs - you not only get a sense of being a spectator to the events, but feel Szpilman's interaction or lack of in those events. This, along with the editing, gives the film a good sense of pace. The first hour goes by quite quickly, filled with anecdotal and historical information, as events in Warsaw go from bad to worse in a matter of days. Then as Szpilman becomes more alone, time begins to drag on, filling the emptiness of loneliness with readiness to move and hide if trouble comes calling. And then finally, the end is insight - the Russians are coming to free Warsaw from the Nazis - and you know it is just a matter of time until that release comes and normality returns. This is truly the work of an auteur, and it is testament to all involved that a film running at two and a half hours feels as though it could have been longer and you would not have minded.All the actors acquit themselves well, but this is Adrien Brody's film. Delivering on the promise he showed in smaller roles in The Thin Red Line and then Summer of Sam, Brody does a wonderful job with Szpilman, conveying a range of emotions simply with his eyes. Special mention should also go to Emilia Fox stepping up from British TV and making a good job of it and Thomas Kretschmann, who, after all the horror of the film, makes a genuinely touching and human Nazi. His scenes with Brody are among the most affecting, though they share very sparse dialogue, conveying everything through silent actions. Top prize has to go to Kretschmann's face as Szpilman plays the Piano for the first time in nearly four years, followed by Brody's weeping relief, not only at having his life spared but at being able to play, for what he must have thought was for the last time in his life.That Brody and Polanski won major awards for their work on this is highly deserved. That the rest of the crew were overlooked is shameful, particularly looking at the films that took their place. However, that is a minor note (no pun intended) and this is a major film (I'll stop now), well deserving of attention. It is thoroughly satisfying and thoroughly cinematic.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Great Film for Musicians,"As a musician, I have to say that this was one of my favourite films. Perhaps only because I enjoy history as well, and this was so well done. I have seen it three times now, and every time I am again in awe of the main character's courage and strength. If you've ever seen The Legend of 1900 and enjoyed it, you should be happy to hear that this movie is similar in nature and scope. The strength of the story and plot line is admirable, especially considering that much of the movie is set with one character and little to no dialog. This movie really takes you into a war-torn place and makes you understand how it feels to be truly alone in the world - without even the comfort of music. Compared to other holocaust movies, I would still rank it near the top, even close to Schindler's List in it's mood.

"The best war movie ever,Best movie on Holocaust..Heartbreaking and Shocking..","Roman Polanski is one of best directors ever to exist,the atmosphere he creates in his movies is so deep and influential. 'Rosemary's Baby', 'Repulsion', 'The Tenant' and 'Chinatown' are all movies which have a great sense of mystery and dark addiction about them but when you mention 'The Pianist', it is his masterpiece.Roman Polanski rejected offer to direct 'Schindler's List'.Though it was a great movie as well,but after 'Pianist' we came to know what he was really thinking.The tale of Wladyslaw Szpilman is told in a flowing and natural way that creates an atmosphere no other War movie can.The story moves like a storm and there isn't a frame you can skip.You cry, you feel pain and you start to feel as a part of miseries of people trapped in Warsaw Ghetto.No other movie has been able to portray the Holocaust better than 'The Pianist'.Even people who want to know what Holocaust was, should watch this mesmerizing experience.Any review of this movie is incomplete without mentioning Adrian Brody.The worries, the hideouts, the hunger and the misery of Szpilman is naturally depicted to you by his powerful performance which earned him a deserved Oscar.The scenes when he is dragging A Can of food around the place he is hiding really brought me shivers to the feelings of a prisoner of war though I have my own experience of GULF WAR in 1990 to relate it with when I was just 10 years old.The realistic atmosphere of the movie is not to be missed by anyone.'The Pianist' is one of the best movies ever made and the best war movie ever and to consider that it is based on a true story of survival, makes it much more Powerful movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

Stupid,"It's really unbelievable that a movie as stupid as ""The Pianist"" can win major prizes and make the IMDb top fifty. (Whenever I catch myself thinking that big no-no, that there must be a Jewish conspiracy in the entertainment industry--as depicted in ""The Protocols of the Morons of Sodom""--I must remind myself that plenty of awful gentile movies have also won Oscars and palmes d'or and whatnot.)It's not so much that ""The Pianist"" is boring or unwatchable. In fact, it's entertaining enough as you watch it--those actors who look more like schoolboys from some prestigious English boarding school than starving Polish Jews, the mean Nazis, those duplicitous, red-cheeked Polacks. Among the many other stupid things about this movie that I've forgotten since I saw it is that everybody is always speaking in English. Now there must be hundreds of holocaust/evil-German movies out there and in most of them all the Germans and their victims speak English! Come on! It's just ridiculous. Let's have a little authenticity, Roman.In short, if you've read Primo Levi's subtle and very readable memoirs about life in the camps in Poland, ""The Pianist"" will seem one-dimensional, banal, and even as evil as the occupation and persecution it purports to denounce.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
An okay film about the same old story...,"I enjoy Polanski's work in general, and I do appreciate this film; but I'm tired of film director's becoming social/political commentators.  Moreover it seems as if this tired concept of ""not forgetting"" about this gruesome episode in European history has an application only to the Jews--all the films made about the Holocaust since WWII haven't prevented genocide of other peoples in Eastern Europe, Africa, South America, etc., so what are these films accomplishing?  Seems like all they do is make a lot of people very rich and line mantles with awards by trivializing the misery of some very brave people, via a medium that is popular at best, because they sure as hell don't stop humankind's atrocities.  Good people don't need melodramatic claptrap to tell them that genocide is bad then, now, or ever; and those who are evil will never get the point anyway no matter how many movie screens it dominates or videos it sells.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

But why is he a pianist?,"First, I have to give a disclaimer. I am not able to give full justice to this movie. It depicts events that exceed the horizon of my understandings. I've seen the Warshaw ghetto, and the concentration camps that are mentioned, and I can only say that I am not capable of understanding whether the cruelty shown does compare with the historical events. It is the discussion heard in the context of ""Schindler's list"", when Jewish critics said that the holocaust cannot be shown in adequate picture. I cannot comment this; but it should be mentioned.The movie did lack, and I am still trying to understand if it lacks it deliberately, one thing that I can comment about: The joy of music. I spend considerable time listening to classical music, mostly piano concertos, and I find it pretty hard to believe that Brodys character is supposed to be a pianist - apart from his slim fingers. He is a pianist like some other man is a bank clerk, it is his job; but he neither seems to miss it, nor does it seem to influence his thinking or feeling. Maybe it is too romantic to believe that the joy of music would survive under the circumstances he experiences, but the topic is dropped without much ado. When he picks up playing piano again, he just plays like he has never missed it or never seen anything that might influence his way of playing.Now, I was watching all that movie mostly to see his reunition with music, and I was surprised how little the scene did tell me. Why does he never play wrong notes? Why is there no different emotion mixed in the music, which is, after all, one of the most emotional piano music ever written? There are young polish pianists like Anderszewsky that could have provided such emotions, maybe only subtle; but I firmly believe it could have been done. For reference, see how Helene Grimaud played the Beethoven concerto on the eve of 9/11/2001. For me, Brody was playing a heartless man. Maybe this is how Polanski intended it to be.For the remaining aspects of the film many good things have been said. It is, after all, only rarely depicted how much the polish people had to suffer. Warshaw was completely destroyed by the German army days before it was liberated, this is too often forgotten.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

"Polanski delivers a personal masterpiece, and a masterpiece that is personal","Disclaimer: Considerable discussion of the plotThere are not many of us who could have our spouse and a number of personal friends visiting murdered by a group of cult members and it not be the biggest personal tragedy of our lives.Such was the case for Roman Polanski in 1969, when a group of those following cult-leader Charles Manson brutally murdered Polanski's wife Sharon Tate, who was eight months pregnant with the couple's first child, and a number of the couple's friends at Polanski's Hollywood home (Polanski was travelling at the time).As tragic, and horrific as this was, it followed an even more troubled childhood. Polanski, and his Jewish parents were living in Poland at the outbreak of World War II. He would ultimately separate from his parents as he escaped the Ghetto to seek refuge with Catholic families in the countryside. Meanwhile, his parents transferred to concentration camps where his mother would meet her death in a gas chamber.After a career of filmmaking that spans nearly fifty years, Polanski has arguably created his best work ever with The Pianist. The film, a true story, begins at the beginning of World War II as Germany has begun bombing Poland, and follows pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman, and his quest to survive his persecution as a Jew under Nazi rule.The film follows as his rights are stripped away from him and his family. First the family loses its sense of security, then their possessions, then they're forced to move to a ghetto where they live in poverty and terror; ultimately his family and friends are shipped off to concentration camps where we all know they will meet their death. Szpilman however manages to find ways to avoid this, first by staying on to perform slave labour in the dismantling of the newly vacated ghetto, and later by going into hiding in the underground supported by a network of Polish nationals. There is nothing heroic about what he does, he just does what he can to survive, and every step of the way there are many who don't survive.Polanski's direction of the film is excellent, yet subtle to the end. Messages are not spoon fed to the audience. The pace is borderline slow, yet captivating nonetheless. Because Szpilman manages to escape before being sent to a concentration camp, the film ends up being less about the Holocaust, and more about what happened to its victims before the camps.The Pianist is the first of two films (The Quiet American being the second) I've seen recently that in their timeliness have added texture to how I view the World and how it deals with Iraq. Early in the film, Szpilman's family take consolation in the fact that Britain and France have declared war against Germany in response to its invasion of Poland. They assume that it will be a matter of weeks before they are emancipated from their newly found oppression. I don't want to get particularly political in a movie review, but the film does do an excellent job of portraying just how much damage can be done by a dictator once he gets going, and that while these may end up as faceless newscasts in on our end, there are real victims on the other end that rely on the rest of the world to oppose the tyranny that affects them.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Adrian Brody is most certainly one of the greatest actors of all time.,"I am posting this message to compliment Roman Polanski on bringing us a factual account of the plight of the Jewish people in World War II.  It was a time of sorrow and despair for these people and it was depicted so vividly because the cast of this film played their roles to perfection.Adrian Brody, who played Wladyslaw Szpilman, is an extremely talented actor, and the only one who could have done so well in the title role.  I was so pleased when he won an Oscar for his performance as no one could have ever been more deserving.  The suffering Szpilman endured just trying to stay alive was beyond our imagination.Darien Wawer, the little boy who died at the wall is a wonderful child actor.  His role portrayed the terrible tragedies that occurred daily to both young and old.  His acting ability is amazing and he played his part very convincingly.So many people helped Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrian Brody) through these difficult years, and one in particular won the hearts of many viewing this film.  That person was Captain Wilm Hosenfeld (Thomas Kretschmann). Apparently a high ranking German officer, Hosenfeld found Szpilman just in time to save him from starvation.  He not only kept this secret, but he brought food enabling Szpilman to survive.  It was heart breaking to learn that Hosenfeld was captured after the war and died in a Soviet prison camp in 1952.  Szpilman was unable to find him and help him.  Thomas Kretschmann was very inspiring in this role.  He is a magnificent actor and I will watch for him in future films.The piano solos performed by Janusz Olejniczak were so beautiful, and the music stays with you long after the film is through.  I have viewed this film many times, and I have come to the realization that throughout the coming years, no one will forget the names of Wladyslaw Szpilman and Captain Wilm Hosenfeld.  We will always feel sorrow for the ones who perished and thankfulness for the ones who survived.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

"a powerful, harrowing film depicting one of the darkest eras in history composed of the memories of two men who experienced it first-hand","""The Pianist"" is a movie of the most appropriate kind. It tells a dark, harrowing true story, coming from the minds and memories of two people who experienced it first-hand. The movie is based on the autobiography of Wladyslaw Spzilman and was directed by Roman Polanski, who both escaped from the Jewish ghettos in Poland and went into hiding until the Second World War had ended. ""The Pianist"" is a composition composed of their memories and experiences and what results is a truly terrific, highly-detailed depiction of one of the darkest moments in human history.The movie depicts the life of Wladyslaw Spzilman (Adrien Brody), a Polish pianist who like all other Jews in Nazi-controlled Europe was forced into a ghetto during World War Two. After being separated from his family, Spzilman climbed over the wall and went into hiding with and sometimes without help from German sympathizers.Director Polanski, who lost his mother to the Holocaust, obviously not only used his own memories of the ghetto and the war, but collected enormous research in preparation for filming, because ""The Pianist"" depicts some truly harrowing situations such as this moment where a German officer, out of boredom, orders about twenty Jewish prisoners to line up. At random, he selects about half of them, orders them to lie flat on their stomachs, and then one by one walks by, shooting them in the head along the way and then letting the others go on. Like in Steven Spielberg's masterpiece, ""Schindler's List"" (1933), ""The Pianist"" does a tremendously great job at depicting the evil of the Nazis and the joy of their murders and torture.But also like ""Schindler's List"", Polanski does not simply display all of Nazi-controlled Europe as evil and prejudiced and murderous. Because like in real life, there were a great many people who did not look upon the Jewish people as less than human and delved into danger, risking their own lives and security to help them. The basic message is that prejudice and hatred exists, but it must be controlled and not be allowed to take over.Adrien Brody, who is seldom off-camera won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Spzilman and that's an absolutely commendable reward. Brody maintains the illusion that he's the real Wladyslaw Spzilman, never succumbing to the tendencies to go over the top with his performance or underplay his hand. He does not become too heroic or too somber. Brody personifies the terrible feeling of loss, but also the dwindling flame of hope and the will to keep going.Now there are some flaws to the movie. Roman Polanski does sometime go a little over the edge with his directing. Sometimes his montages of the ghetto and the city go on for a little too long and there is one sequence in particular where Spzilman plays Frederic Chopin's Ballade No. 1 in its almost full form. And while the music is beautiful, we must remember, this is a film we're watching, not a concert. And the movie does run for about twenty minutes too long, but other than that, this is a more than recommendable Holocaust movie. And again, its true power comes from the fact that it composed of the memories of two men who went through similar experiences and were fortunate enough just to survive the war, although the real Spzilman had to live out the rest of his life without what he'd lost and Polanski continues to do so today. And that is true not just of them, but of millions.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Very good movie about a man with a passion,"This was a very good movie. The director was Roman Polanski, he does a great job of showing the characters emotion.

8.5 on IMDB.
85% on Metacritic.
7 Oscars nominations; 3 Oscars wins (bee actor, director, adapted screenplay).This movie is excellent from start to finish. Adrien Brody 100% immersed himself in the role and it was so believable he won an Oscar. The plot, screenplay, cinematography, editing, etc., it was all great and done right. I have not read Wtadystaw Szpilman's memoir, but I got the feeling that the movie stuck to the source faithfully. They stuck with the pianist's perspective from start to finish and only once deviated from it, as in, every single scene in the entire movie with the exception of one, is shown directly from Szpilman's perspective. The only exception is the scene where Szpilman's fellow musician sees a ""certain someone"" and later tells him about it. It was still a great scene.Adrien Brody - excellent work from start to finish. Oscar-worthy. The supporting cast did fine too.Conclusion: a must-watch. Well-made from start to finish. Deserved the best picture win. Highly recommend. Re-watcheable.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Good and gratefulness evoking,"I thought that this will make me sadder. My first though to be frank. I have seen my fair share of ww2 movies and documentaries that might have left me more speechless and shocked and sad.It is a great film but I do agree with people that express the opinion of this being a story of survival of one man during ww2.The scenes are amazing in terms of realness, the city in ruins and whole vibe of the filming very realistic. The progression of development of war and jewish situation also shown in a way that one realizes how slowly they have been devalued and de-humanised. The german soldier that at the end helps the pianist and later on being killed is for me just a portrayal what war does, to both sides.There are numerous films that show more ww2 monstrosities in terms of being in touch with the dimensions of this tragedy in time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Materpiece,"The main reason why I watched The Pianist was the fact that it is about a pianist. I myself play the piano. But after seeing it I realized that it has far more reasons to watch it.The different thing from most other movies about war is that it is just about one single person. The struggle of one man. That's why you got more details about war and how people really felt. It allows you to be a witness of the fight of this very man, his feelings, his fears and his happy moments. Sometimes you feel happy for him because he got a new home and people that support him, and in the next minute you want to cry because of this terrible things that are happening to him.You can say about Roman Polanski whatever you want. But he did a masterpiece with this movie. It also was so good because Polanski has been through this horror. He lost his family during World War IIand that gives the film even more deepness.Maybe the title of the movie scares some people. They just thing it's about piano playing and music. But this is the worst reason you can have of this film. The main story is about a pianist, that's right, but it's about his survival because of music. His love and passion for music helped him to never stop hoping. And this is what this movie is about. It's about a person that lived through all that horror without stopping to believe.Never judge a film because of the title. Watch the Pianist and I'm sure you'll will think about things in a different way.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

One of the best Holocaust films ever,"Holocaust movies are always tough to watch for me, and I confess my lack of capacity to be objective on this respect. Trying to re-tell the un-speakable in the format of popular entertainment is impossible, and I have a hard time avoiding the emotional aspects and mastering my personal feelings. 'The Pianist' is one of the best movies in the genre. The comparison with 'Schindler's List' is immediate, as both films look at the Holocaust from the angle of the tragedy of the Jewish people with personal or family connotations for the directors, as well as they bring the perspective of the True Human Beings who risked their own lives to save the lives of individuals threatened by the Nazi death machine. In my opinion both films are very good, some of the best cinema two great and different directors of our times have ever made.'The Pianist' is a good film by all criteria. Although some editing cuts would have helped in avoiding repetitions, it never ceases to be shocking and emotional. Adrien Brody gives a great performance, and the camera work is great, with a classical touch reminding us that Poland gave some of the greatest cinema artists of our times. 10/10 on my personal scale.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Jarring Holocaust Piece of a Man's Determined Survival,"This was improbably my first Polanski, not surprisingly my first Brody, but certainly not my first World War Two/Holocaust picture.  I have to admit I knew little going 'in' to this except holding foolish thoughts like 'how many more times are they going to make a movie on this topic?'Polanski blows that preconception apart.  He provides a startlingly fresh approach to the genre which includes _Schindler's List_ and to a lesser extent, _Saving Private Ryan_.  Like 'SPR' _The Pianist_ uses technically proficient shots of horrific violence.  Unlike 'SPR' these sequences are sporadic and always come like a jarring physical blow.  Much like some of the more successful practitioners of some forms of metal and punk music, you can come off being far more brutal and shocking if you're not so thick with the dissonance.Yet much of _The Pianist_ power comes in the form of traumatic psychological violence.  Like _Schindler's List_, this is the story of Jewish survival at all costs during the Nazi Pogrom.  However unlike 'SL', this is not the epic broad-stroke of an entire population's suffering but largely the tale of a single man and his efforts to stay alive.  Not to say that either this or 'SL' is significantly better than the other, they are to disparate in their approach to be fairly judged tete a tete.  But _The Pianist_ accomplishes a few things 'SL' couldn't by narrowing its scope somewhat.  Not that Polanski completely throws away the horrible effects such atrocities had on a wide range of people.  We learn that it takes the fellowship of his people, the kindess of the underground German resistance, and a few other more unlikely supporters not to mention no small amount of sheer luck for Mr. Szpilman to survive.Brody is terrific as Szpilman logging more screen time than just about everyone else combined.  I hope to see him again as soon as possible.  Now to go see more Polanski immediately.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
"Poetic, Poignant, Beautiful","This film moved me. I have been a sucker for films based around Nazi Germany and World War II, but this was the only film that truly devastated me to the brink of tears. Perhaps I was in the right mood for it. This is the kind of movie you watch curled up in a heavy winter night with a warm cup of coffee and absolute silence. It is a treat for the soul.The most admirable aspect of the film is The Pianist's will to live on. His courage and refusal to give up reminds us of the common courage in everyday people. In the film, the Pianist himself is not the victim of most brutalities, he is more of a witness to what goes on around him. More than a fighter, he is a survivor. He never truly wishes to die, he wants to live on. I will never forget the scene in which he he sits in an empty hospital, playing the piano in the air, trying to drown out the horrors of the shooting around him. Striped Pajamas, Schindler's list, Book Thief... none of them come close to the utter majesty of this film's cinematography. 10/10 for this movie.

Passafist Dissects The Pianist using Castaway,"Hollywood Sucks!  I have just witnessed a cinematic masterpiece, a film that is about characters and events, that's lyrical and beautiful and all I can think of after it is how much of a tool Tom Hanks is.  Why is it that after experiencing Roman Polanski's THE PIANIST I can only think of Robert Zemeckis's CAST AWAY?  It's a really an eerie feeling, but go with me for a little while.  Maybe my ranting will begin to make sense.THE PIANIST is the powerful and lyrical life story of Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrian Brody, Summer of Sam), a Jew living in Poland during World War II. It follows him from a peaceful life as a piano player on polish radio, to the ghetto's of Warsaw, to hiding in empty apartments, and all the while dreaming of life as it once was.  CASTAWAY is the story of Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks, The Money Pit) a FedEx employee that gets trapped on a deserted island and in the end talks to volleyball.How are these two stories similar?  They're both about men trying to make through unbelievable circumstances and how they must do it alone.  One takes the Hollywood approach, where everything is ambiguously tied up at the end. The other takes a more lyrical approach, where a man returns to what he does best.  The Pianist takes the lyrical approach and in the end is more successful a story.Brody is fantastic.  For much of the film he's teetering on that thin line between madness and sanity.  Nothing more telling than the scene, in which, Szpilman, whom hasn't eaten in days, finds an unopened jar of pickles.  In his attempt to open that jar he is confronted by his worst fear, a German guard standing before him.  In a Hollywood film, this scene would be about Szpilman breaking free and running away.  But in the PIANST it about him longing for that can of pickles.  When he picks it up off the floor he holds onto it for dear life.  If his life is not taken by the guard he's got to eat so he's not letting go.  It's a small moment that is really powerful.I contrast that with Tom Hanks teetering on that thin line as well.  He has a friend, he talks to a volleyball.  But this relationship is far different. This relationship is about giving the actor something to talk to.  The most dramatic moment in this film is when he losses the Volleyball. Problem is the film suggests that the volleyball is a character and not a need, like food. This moment is so huge it spoils what should be a moment of discovery for the character. The moment when he can go on without his crutch, but all the audience cares about is a stupid volleyball.The final moments in THE PIANIST are also small but have strong impact. Moments before the credits roll we see Szpilmann sitting in an open field, wondering what to do next.  It then cuts to him doing what he's always done. He's beaten those who have tried to keep him down.  It's encouraging but the music doesn't have to swell, and the violins don't have to play.  It's a small intimate moment.  The scene does not force emotion, but there is much there.  It plays with life the way life really is, when the battle is over, we may have changed but we still sometimes go back to what we are good at. He one tha battle and he can play again.CASTAWAY puts the hero right in the middle of a literal crossroads.  What should he do next?  The camera circles around him, and he walks down a road. But while  Both moments are very similar, this moment is over sentimental.  It forces emotions and it fails to move you, you don't really care what road he choses.  It kind of diminishes his battle.  He has nowhere to go and I'm sure none of us want to follow.In film sometimes plot is inconsequential.  I would have loved to have been trapped on an island with Wladyslaw Szpilman as much as I didn't care about Chuck Noland on an island, and well he'd probably wind up gassed in a polish concentration camp had he come up in that time.  That's what is great about Brody's performance, he is in every  scene of this movie, and fills the screen with a character of depth and strength.  Hanks fills the screen with a character of no depth and mostly surface strength.It's amazing that I could compare two completely opposite films and explain how one fails and the other one works.  But I have found a new film I can call a favorite and another film I can never rent again.  One is powerful, the other dull and yet they have two characters that can be very similar.Do yourself a favor and rent THE PIANST, you won't be disappointed.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Brilliant and yet sad......,"I went see The Pianist tonight feeling a bit curious and expecting the usual Saving Private Ryan spread. Man, I was wrong. This Roman Polanski directed film effectively conveys the horrors of The Holocaust that the Polish Jews have to endure during the German Occupation in Warsaw, Poland WW2. Jews; young and old, are shot for no reason, abused, and ridiculed. Caught in the middle of this nightmare was Wladyslaw Szpilman (brilliantly potrayed by Adrian Brody) a young and talented pianist and his Jewish family. They, like other Jews, were forced into small ghettoes and are sealed off from other parts of the city. There, they live their lives in poverty, waiting to be deported to concentration camps. In a heart wrenching scene, he was separated from his family and was forced to survive on his own in the ghettoes of Warsaw. From that point of the movie, it started to run a little slow. Even so, Adrian's performance shows him constantly hiding in the shadows, waiting, watching, fearing whether the next day would be his last. He doesn't talk much in this part of the film but the facial expression and body language tells it all. The other actors that supported Szpilman like his family also convey the sense of looming fear and dread that is also present in the other Jews in the film. This really and I mean realistically, gives us the impression that the Holocaust is much more than just the slaughtering of 3 million Jews (FACT;from the start and end of WW2).Some points of the movie are interspersed with haunting piano solos. Being a music appreciator especially piano acoustics, the music from the film further conveys the suffering endured by our pianist. There is one piano solo that still resonates in my eardrums, but you will have to find out for yourselves.Roman Polanski's beautiful cinematics truly captures the emotions and horrors of the war. A noted scene would be when Szpilman walks through the battered city ruins of Warsaw, a look at this scene reminds me of the blown buildings of Hiroshima after the first A-Bomb was dropped.One of the best films of the year, its going to be in my DVD collection later this year. Its a shame if the Academy does not recognize the talents of Adrian Brody and instead giving it to others like Daniel Day Lewis for Gangs of New York. Still, its very tacky to give it to actors who potray psychopaths. 9/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Roman Polanski Renders 'The Pianist' Like A Melancholy Poetry!,"Truth can be and often is stranger than fiction and so it is with the true story of pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish Jew who through sheer nerve and luck managed to escape the clutches of the uber-efficient Nazi death machine.Szpilman before the war was a nationally renowned musician. At the start of the film, he's playing Chopin on Polish radio just as World War II begins and bombs drop all around the radio studio, knocking it off the air, and knocking Szpilman's life into a downward spiral. Little by little, Szpilman and his family are subjected to the Nazi process of separating the Jewish population of Warsaw from the rest of the inhabitants. Starting with restaurants and parks being closed to them, they are forced from upper middle-class security into life in the arm-banded ghetto to their final journey on the train where they herded as less compromising compatriots into the rolling pens of death. Just when the audience is on the verge of becoming numbed by the grim life in the ghetto, the pianist, through quirks of fate, is spared the death camps, only to go into hiding in abandoned apartments, trusting sympathetic Poles to protect him in a world where an act of kindness can be a death sentence. Szpilman becomes a voyeur to the horror he witnesses through windows and half-closed doors that lead to a world that has become a death trap. Battles rage, Nazis march, and civilians are mowed down as he watches helplessly. Just when the Nazi brutality against the Jews seems unbearable, a music-loving German soldier treats the pianist kindly while Jewish victims prey on each other.The Pianist is rendered with a melancholy poetry by Roman Polanski. His depiction of life in the Warsaw Ghetto is a series of disturbing images framed with a sense of urgency. However, these images don't need any melodramatic embellishment. And in this way, Polanski ensures he is not cheapening the story by appealing to our pity. What he has this film ask of us is to bear witness that such things happened in a civilized place, to never forget that they can and do happen still. And yet amid the usual roster of sadism, there are notes of unexpected poignancy that tug at your heart strings. The scene where Szpilman climbs over the wall and is walking through a veritable waste land of destroyed buildings is a powerfully quiet, cold image of death.The muted heroism of Szpilman's survival flashes as a fragile and determined pulse in Adrien Brody's magnificently understated performance. As Szpilman, he brilliantly echoes the film's tone of stunned disbelief, as a series of events transforms him from an elegantly dressed, highly cultured musician to a scavenging, debased shell of a human being. His performance is a marvel of wary tenacity and unquenchable humanity.The Pianist is an emotionally devastating film that will linger in the minds of all who experience it; the notion that war is the absence of art in our dealings with one another will remain as timeless as a well-written phrase.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
"Brilliant, well-wrought film with a profound message.","Brilliant film - in my opinion Polanski's greatest, or at least one of them.

It is time to correct that mistake.Brody's performance in the title role is deeply moving.  He is extremely well-cast, and carries a good part of the movie on his own, or nearly so. The integration of the German soldier is well-wrought and unexpected despite a persistent, terrible sense that the pianist's ""luck"" cannot hold out.Ten out of ten to this film; it is as near flawless as it is possible to be.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
A story that needs to be told and retold,"The story of the Holocaust is one that  needs to be told and retold. Tragically, it could happen again, to another group of people, to us or to our children.  History too often repeats itself...For me, ""The Pianist"" is one of the most moving and powerful films of my lifetime.  Each person brings to a film a different life experience.  I have been to Warsaw and seen the ghetto; I have been to Auschwitz.  I will never  forget the sadness I felt.  It had to be a horrifying and hopeless time for Polish Jews, and for those few who were able to survive the Nazi occupation.  The story of Wladyslaw Szpilman mesmerized me; I was close to tears throughout much of the film.Polanski's filming of Szpilman's story is honest and unsentimental.  All aspects of the film, especially the music of Chopin, add brilliantly to the whole.  The actors are well-chosen - family members, friends, strangers who helped.  Thomas Kretschmann as the German officer is perfect.Yet it is Adrien Brody's performance that triumph's in ""The Pianist"". He portrays Szpilman as a man of many layers and moods - first smug and self-satisfied, next mystified and unwilling and unbelieving, finally strunggling to help his family survive.  When he is cut off from those he loves, his music, his life, Brody is especially powerful.  He shows us Szpilman's hopelessness, boredom, frustration, longing, fear, his desperate will to survive.  I could not keep my eyes off his expressive eyes (and eyebrows). I will always cherish this compelling film depicting both our humanity and our inhumanity.  I was ecstatic when a surprised Adrien Brody won Best Actor at the Oscars.  Roman Polanski's well-earned win was also deserved.  And for me, it WAS the best film of 2002.

A World War classic. Must watch war drama.,"""The Pianist"" is biographical war drama film, based on the the perils faced and evaded by a Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Jewish pianist in Poland, amidst the Nazi conquest and rule over Poland during WW 2.
There are but very few movies which have been able to depict the atrocities faced by the Jewish community under the Nazi rule with a realistic portrayal of those times. ""The Pianist"" is certainly one among those. Even though this movie focuses on Szpilman's evasion from a otherwise certain holocaust with some luck and good helpful acquaintances, it skillfully shows some of the most moving scenes depicting human hunger, helplessness and hardships faced by the Polish Jews.
The acting performance is top-notch by the cast, especially Adrien Brody as Szpilman. The focus on the main story theme, without getting didactic and a gripping screenplay makes this movie a master-piece of the genre.

Briliant FIlm!,"THE PIANIST does have merits of its own even though it doesn't really bring much to the table originality wise . Actually the food allegory is appropriate though slightly confusing . Early in the film we see the terrible conditions in the Warsaw ghetto as its Jewish population are effectively walled up from the rest of the city and left to die . Cut to a restaurant interior as Wladyslaw Szpilman entertains the guests by playing the piano as the patrons grow fat by gorging themselves on food , fine wine and cigarettes as their fellow Jews fall dead in the streets . With a little editing you might find yourself thinking this part was directed by David Irving instead of Roman Polanski ! One thing THE PIANIST does do well is include the apocryphal tale of the Jews discussing their fate at the hands of the Nazis with no one wanting to believe for a second that the lone voice stating the Nazis are deporting them to be murdered may in fact be talking the truth no matter how unbelievable and horrific the truth may beLike I AM LEGEND the story suffers from the fact that the protagonist has no one to speak to for large portions of the narrative but there's so much incident on screen such as the Warsaw uprising it's not a major problem . You could make the point that Szpliman then becomes a spectator to Polish history rather than a character in his own right and you'd possibly be correct but these scenes are very well choreographed and filmed that it shouldn't be made as a criticism . There's also the introduction of "" A good German "" that we've seen before in films such as MUTTER'S COURAGE but Hosenfeld is so well drawn and acted by Thomas Kretschmann it's very difficult not to feel sorry for his fateIn truth THE PIANIST follows the usual structure of holocaust movies but unlike some movies of this particular genre certainly deserved much of the critical acclaim hoisted upon it .

A Very Polish Jewish Holocaust Story,"My husband demurred going to see ""The Pianist ""as he ""didn't want to see another Holocaust movie."" Besides that every survivor's story is unique, besides the beautiful cinematography where color looks like browning black-and-white photos, and the tremendous performance and physical transformations by New Yorker Adrien Brody (and it's nice to finally see a real Jewish nose on a Holocaust movie star), Roman Polanski does have a different perspective to give.This is the first time I can recall a specifically Polish Jewish viewpoint, even though other films have also dealt with the Warsaw Ghetto's creation, uprising, and destruction. While Wladyslaw Szpilman's personal story is no way identical to Polanski's similarly accidental personal survival of the Holocaust, the film is suffused with what are clearly Polanski's vivid memories, particularly of pre-war Warsaw, the round-ups, and then the post-war city-wide devastation.The Szpilman family's urbane integration into secular Polish society is made clear at the outset; Wladyslaw is flirting with a non-Jewish colleague and the Nazi restrictions mostly interfere with his dating routine at first. Strong family ties, even among adult children, are beautifully portrayed.But what is most startling throughout is the sympathetic view of Poles, unlike any similar movie. We hear frequently from Poles who are saddened by the restrictions, only see one glimpse of a Polish anti-Semite, and we frequently see Polish resistance fighters and their sympathizers, though they come out of the woodwork mostly due to Szpilman's fame. The infamous, compromised Jewish policemen in the Ghetto are given harsher treatment by the filmmaker.My ignorance of classical music made me miss a key point in one scene as I didn't know what piece he was playing and wanted to know if he was playing a Polish or German composer, though I inferred from the closing credits that it was probably German.But that was evidently a fictive scene. As I saw the film in Kew Gardens, Queens, settlement of many survivors, an elderly man on the line said, in a strong accent, when he was 15 in Warsaw after the war he'd met Szpilman, who recounted his story to him, and that the German who saved him did so for him as a human being, not a pianist.  Would that have been more moving?",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Watch this movie!,This was truly one of the best movies I have ever seen. The Pianist left me speechless when I left the theater. Adrian Brody was brilliant as Wladyslaw Szpilman in his true life struggle for survival during the Nazi invasion of Poland. Not since the Diary of Anne Franke has a story of a Jewish family or an individual that is hiding for their life been so emotional.

The pianist,"The film's shot is sober and thoughtful, stroking the pianist's melancholy face, nervously watching the corpses strewn across the street and calmly watching life crumble in an instant. Life is so sweet and so fragile. There are many unforgettable scenes in the film, and there are real existential life and death plays. There are many characters in the movie, who show various behaviors in the war and profoundly show the complex expression of human nature in the war. The war destroyed the world, but the complexity and change of human nature are highlighted in this impasse.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Survival of the human spirit,"Adrien Brody got the role of his life in The Pianist. It is not difficult to be moved when you see the imminent horrors of you and your family's possible death sentence for reasons you grasp but somehow silently protest to and however lost you are in such situations, you will try to keep your composure and be dignified as a family. As the main character moves in artistic, educated circles, he was able to survive through the help of caring friends and connections. But that is only for a limited period, then rough reality sets in, lack of food, sickness, being locked from the outside of an apartment, bombings, hiding , whatever you might do in order to survive. Thomas Krenschmann is highly credible , definitely he shone in his short albeit crucial role as the high ranking officer who due to his love of music sheltered Adrien during the end days of the second world war . One can't help but agonize with Adrien as he suffers , suffers, suffers and suffers.

A Terse Statement,"I did enjoy this movie and its depiction of semi-actual events.  However, the length and editing of this movie made me feel as if I'd actually been living for five years during WWII; normally, this immersion in the environment would be wonderful, but in this bleak, depressing scenario the effect was to make me exhausted.  The editing depended heavily on close attention to detail and scene, as Polanski is certainly not given to fast editing (thankfully); however, the presence of several spurious scenes ultimately led me to feel tired upon completion of the film. A great movie -- I give it a 9 -- but it could have been better had the movie not felt like an epic crossed with an opus.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

I am not a fan of war movies that were directed by Americans because I find that they tend to glorify themselves or romanticise war, or even both. It makes me sick because there are no winners in war, only survivors, the wounded and the dead.

"Stunning and deeply moving film about war, atrocities, hope, and survival.","The piano performances in this film were VERY memorable.  There was a fine level of detail - such as a flawless performance of Chopin's Ballade in Gm using a purposefully out-of-tune piano that was fitting for the scene of a burned out section of the city.The stark reality of the war and the Holocaust was presented with no reservation  - as one person mentioned above, just as if it were simply being reported by the author. And because of some of the more horrific moments - even as beautifully as this film was shot, I might find it difficult to watch ever again.  Very powerful.Besides the beautiful score, I felt the cast, cinematography and directing were superb - best I've seen from just about any film in a few years.

"Out of a horrific time, a beautiful work of art","Roman Polanski's The Pianist is without a doubt one of the greatest films ever made about the Holocaust, and easily one of the top five films of the year.The story is essentially Adrien Brody's quiet, good-natured classical pianist struggling to survive the horrors of the Holocaust. We watch him and his loving family as their hopes for liberation are slowly crushed, and, in an extraordinarily moving sequence, how he is separated from them, their fate left a mystery to him for several years. The rest of the film concerns Brody alternating between hiding and running from the Germans, witnessing pieces of the war, glimpsing and, to an extent, collaborating with the Jewish rebellion in Warsaw. It is a quiet, slow-paced film, often musicless but occassionally accompanied by beautiful classical pieces. Polanski's direction is subtle, disciplined, and impeccably well-timed. Brody's performance is also subtle, and he says very little, but compare his demeanor and facial expressions at the end of the film to how he looks at the beginning, and you see a profound change. Brody strikes all the right notes for this part, delivering a quiet performance of resounding power.As far as the subject matter, you need to look to Polanski himself to truly understand why this film is significant. There have been several films made about this subject, most notably Spielberg's brilliant Schindler's List, but none quite capture the same tone that this film does. Polanski was himself a Holocaust survivor who survived not unlike Brody's Szpilman. He was not heroic, he did not defy the Nazi regime as Oskar Schindler did, but he hid, viewing the horror from an objective distance and avoiding it at all costs. Spielberg put us in the thick of the horror; Jews were shot and killed right before our eyes, the blood splattered in front of the camera. With Polanski's film we watch the horror unfold at a distance, from fourth story-windows we see tiny Nazi soldiers shooting tiny Jews in the street. There is a realism and urgency to what we are watching because we are seeing it as Polanski and Szpilman did, and we wonder if perhaps one of those soldiers may look up and see us.The Holocaust was a horrible event most of all, Polanski reminds us, because heroism could not save the majority of Jews. Szpilman could not confront the Nazis head on, or he certainly would have died. Instead he hides in corners, watching and recording the events of a dark time in the world's history. The ultimate catharsis, for Polanski and for the late Szpilman, comes in the final scene, when the pain and suffering of the Holocaust is transformed into beautiful art, and Polanski places us in the audience, close enough to be touched but far enough away to feel as if we're really sitting in the same room. Playing piano was Szpilman's catharsis; filmmaking is Polanski's. The Pianist may not be Polanski's ""best"" film, but by watching it we see a glimpse of his soul, letting go of the demons left by the Holocaust.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Somber look at a very prevalent period of history,"I watched this film, as I'm sure everyone else did with the feeling of knowing what would become of a lot of the characters involved before it even began, Yet it still managed to keep my attention, yet in my opinion this is the best made film available on Netflix as of right now. It aims to do exactly what it did and it presented me with conflicting emotions on what I felt was a very consistently tense feeling throughout the film as there is always a looming danger, it also pieces together the beginning of the war to the end and the downfall of the reich and the personal struggle of a man through one very real and unfortunate story of resilience and struggle that ultimately left me wanting to wipe the film from my memory and be able to watch it over from the start, great film and would recommend it to anyone looking for a very real and gritty outlook on the reality and brutality of being a Jewish person at that moment of history",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

Its so unusual in today's world dominated by big budget franchised run of the mill commercial tripe movies, for an actor to totally become their character.

The cruel side of the German army, their decline, etc were are similar to us through history books and the front runner films. The shot was Szpilman walks through that dilapidated or the collapsed buildings make us cry at some point because Polanski created that situation unto the most.

"Manipulative the first hour, lineal during the rest","In a general way, this movie can be divided into two parts, that differ in temporal terms, as well as in substance ones. The first part, shorter in time, seemed to me to be similar in content to those save the whales spots that Greenpeace makes you watch in school to generate environmental conscience. Not that I have a problem with Jewish folk, nor the whales, in fact I find extremely appalling both genocides, but the truth is that the victimist discourse that tries to bring the public into tears by making them feel impotent in front of the images is a very wasted one, particularly if the topic in discussion is the Jewish Holocaust (not to mention the whales). It would have been interesting to see Polanski driving the narration in a more objective way, showing the cause and the effect (in other words the reason why the Germans invaded Poland and persecuted the Jewish folk, as well as the persecution itself), and not only the effect, especially if proceeding that way the victimization of the Jewish is out of question (there's no way to be an apologist of the Holocaust, but there could have been a little sketch of the poor excuse for a twisted logic there was behind the invasion that would ""explain"" the behavior of the German soldiers in the movie), but would have avoided to fall into the coarse cliché it did. The second part, that entails a sudden twist in the narration, characterizes for being quite faster then the previous one (justifying its longer time), becoming a sort of adventure movie, well-driven most of the time, but that tended to be superfluous and implausible (fact that, by the way, has in this movie a wider tolerance rate: facts that in other movie would have tasted false or fictitious, in this movie were forgiven, due to the fat that it was ""based on a real story"") by times; in which the ups and downs of the pianist are told in a lineal way and without focusing that much on the external events, closing the public's perception: as opposite as in the first part, where one was witness of the ""pathos"" of the main character's family and the entire ghetto; in this one, one only gets to acknowledge only the facts concerning him. On the other hand, by the same time this perception is closing, one can feel a relief concerning the effectist discourse mentioned above. In deed, by this time they start to enter the scene the pro-Jewish characters, that seem to appear as life savers in this sea of anti-Semite people. But this relief comes a bit late into scene, as the public is already determinated by the previous scenes. From the technique aspect, we find the strong side of the movie: the photography is just splendid (keep an eye for the scene where the pianist finds himself before the destructed Warsaw); as well as the piano playing scenes, which are not only of a visual interest, but also provide us of an exquisite hearing pleasure (While many may complain about Chopin and say he is some sort of Gustavo Adolfo Béquer of the music, in the way that he didn't compose for art, but in order to get dates; they cannot deny that he is just more that a deployment of mere virtuosity à la Malmsteen, but that the music has a feeling and beauty that surround it). Regarding the acting, we must say it is well over the average but it isn't something out of this world, nor something like that. In the case of the secondary characters it's not that easy to tell, as there are so many and their performances are too little to define an opinion. Nevertheless, despite these last favorable points, I must continue to think that Polanski could have made a greater effort in this movie, since just by it self, or in comparison with his previous work, is quite unsatisfactory.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
The kind of movie I thought they had forgotten how to make,"Connoisseurs of fine film, here is an epic for you. Be warned, the first half is exceptionally violent, although the mood shifts to one of suspense in the second half.  Although this site jointly recommends ""The Pianist"" along with Schindler's List, Spielberg's movie is more Middle American than Central European in flavor; Polanski has a much firmer hand on the material, he understands all the ramifications in a way that others cannot.  Superb ensemble acting, especially from Frank Finlay and Emilia Fox.  Fine pyrotechnics and stunt work (with one stunt in particular, I cannot figure out how they did it).  As a spectator, you really feel you are in the midst of the Warsaw Ghetto, among suffering people about to die.  Good to see Polanski back on form, any shortcomings are incidental (the pianist's friendship with the decent Nazi soldier at the end of the movie seems a little too good to be true, although is apparently based on fact).  This film is Polanski's gift not just to the Jewish people, but to the Polish people.  It is a movie for those, like me, who admire the Jewish people for all they have achieved and who take due note of all the unspeakable horrors they have endured through time, which must never be forgotten.

It serves as a stark reminder of the human capacity for both cruelty and compassion. The film explores themes of resilience, survival, and the power of art in the face of adversity. Szpilman's love for music and his unwavering spirit become sources of solace and hope in the darkest of times.The cinematography and production design of ""The Pianist"" contribute to its authenticity and emotional impact.

Awesome!

But all such considerations are irrelevant when one experiences The Pianist.The power of this film lies in its ability to once again shock viewers familiar with the Holocaust and cinematic accounts of it such as Shoah (1985) and Schindler's  List (1993). Once again, and seemingly for the first time, it leaves one astonished not only at the brutality of humanity is capable of, but also of the miraculous ability people have to survive the deepest psychological wounds of incomprehensible trauma.Adrien Brody's performance is a wonder, especially since he seems to appear in every scene, if not every frame, of this epic tale.Oscars, please, for Brody and director Roman Polanski, and a lesson to ""Gangs of New York"" director Martin Scorsese in how to forge a grand-scale, historical drama into a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

[Not commented upon was the betrayal of the Polish partisans in Warsaw by the Russian army.  This grim story will require another movie.]In any event, this movie must be seen. Luckily, it is as close as most of us will ever come to evil on this massive a scale.  (At least, that is my hope.

"Excellent effects, authentic display of Nazi-violence, but lacks otherwise","(no spoilers) This movie displays very detailed the cruelty and inhumane treatment particularly of Jews in Poland during the Nazi regime.  The special effects in the movie are as brilliant as you would expect them to be after having seen movies like Saving Private Ryan, for example.However, when it comes to a logical and interesting story-line the movie really would not have suffered from improvements. I mean, displaying Nazi cruelties has been previously well shown in other WWII movies (Schindler's list for example) and alone it doesn't represent anything original and neither does it add up nicely to an interesting plot. Although it might have been very important to Polanski to stress the war crimes committed, a pure listing of horrifying events does surely not make a good movie, it rather fills you with disgust.The pianist's love towards music, the emotions during the loss of beloved ones and during separation in addition to those horrifying scenes of cruelty and in general more plausible acting rather than a mere run-and-hide movie would have made this movie less boring (if you can describe horrifying scenes as boring).During the first 45 minutes I wondered if I actually wanted to watch this movie at all.

Polanski's personal horror story,"""The Pianist"" tells the story not only of Szpilmann,but also of Polanski himself.A lot of the scenes are directly from his youth in the ghetto of Warsaw.This makes this movie even more impressive.Although the entire movie is very good,I personally was the most impressed by the first hour or so(until Szpilmann's family is put on the train to the concentration camp).this part is truly about the absolute horror of the holocaust and it shows the terrible circumstances in which the Jewish people had to live.Adrien Brody plays brilliant and deserves the Oscar he received,he is almost in every scene the main character!Still,there are a few things that annoyed me in this movie.First of all the fact that the Nazi's speak German but the Polish people speak English(!?),this is really a shame since it takes away a lot of the realism of the movie.Roman Polanski should have said:Up yours! to the producers and big bosses of the studio's and should have let everybody speak in their native language.It is not consistent,or how we would say in Holland:He who says A,must also say B. Another thing is the,what I call,""overkill""-scene.This is the scene in which a couple of Jews are to lie down on the ground while a Nazi shoots them in the back of the face.The last Jew is a friend of Szpilmann and what I feared for happened.The gun of the Nazi is out of bullets when he wants to shoot him,so he has to replace the cartridge.This to me is too Hollywoodish and was not needed in this movie,it is too much sensation and gore! The last bad thing happens at the end.Szpilmann sees the Russians come into the Ghetto in which he hides.He comes out to celebrate,but he's wearing a Nazi coat that he got from a moderate,""human"", Nazi(if there are any).The Russians of course think he is the enemy,so they start shooting,I figured that they would kill him so that Polanski shows that this is the true horror and unnecessary factor that is war.But no,Szpilmann runs through the Ghetto like Arnold Schwarzenegger and he is not hit by one of the many bullets.This is again too much Hollywood,it is not realistic.Although there are a few flaws in the movie that are a shame,(especially the English speaking Polish people)it still remains as one of the best and most impressive Holocaust movies ever made(to me Schindler's List is better,probably because it was made first,so that any other holocaust movie doesn't look like a real add-on).This movie is a definitely not unnecessary and it is very important as a historic piece of art.   9/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
"Pianist is the study of human nature, facing the society and himself.","Don't let the narrative and the picture fool you. This is not another World War film, defending the Jews, or another `Hollywood' high budget combat movie. In fact Jews are symbolized here as innocent people and they can be anybody who has been discriminated in the world, throughout the history. The story is responsible in confronting you with Wladyslaw Szpilman's life style and persona. The point is not the war or the racial and religious issues, indeed it is the study of people. Pianist is a profound look at the man's psychological behavior within his society and himself. It challenges human emotions during the hardest times of life. After watching this film one may realize the hope, fear, sensation, egotism, and enterprise that every person has toward life. The protagonist is not a hero, rather a survivor. He sought to stay alive and he made it, by sacrificing everything that he had. He left his beloved family, and decided to run away instead of following the fate. His home town is destroyed and his people are being tortured and murdered in front of his eyes. Yet nothing stopped him in reaching his goal. The protagonist is in a war, but this war can be in the midst of anything, not only the enemy on the other side of the wall. The conflict can be within him and his soul, him and the society, culture, ideology or another individual.Pianist is a must see film for all the people, regardless their gender, race, and nationality.

A Very Emotional and One of the Polanski's best movies.,"An Excellent And Emotional Movie and Story(which i was amazed to find out that its a true story) of a polish-Jewish pianist who survives the World War II,along with an excellent and Oscar Deserving performance from Adrien Brody and great work to show his story from director Roman Polanski.The Movie is about a Jewish Pianist who works for a local polish radio,but World War II breaks and when Poland is invaded by the Nazi Germany, he is separated from his family and must survive the war on his own,hiding in unknown houses due to help from some of his friends.It Shows how he is determined to survive the gruesome war,along with keeping his never-ending dedication to music and love of playing the piano.Some of the scenes are really gruesome,and you feel for the character throughout the movie.A Great and emotional portrayal of Pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman by Adrien Brody, who got an Oscar for this performance,and probably he deserved it due to excellent acting of the character who is the heart of this movie.He acted excellently throughout the movie,specially in the last scene, when he plays the piano to save his live after getting caught in hiding by a German SS Officer.Roman Polanski marked himself as one of the best directors of all time with this film, by showing the portrayal of this character superbly, also having a big part in Brody's Oscar Winning performance, along with showing the ruthlessness of the Nazis and the destruction of war in this movie perfectly. He made this into probably one of the best war movies of all time and one of his best till date.The Story which is true events which occurred to the real Szpilman, written by his good friend Jerzy Waldorff is excellently written and well done to Ronald Harwood for writing an excellent screenplay and he got rewarded for it by winning an Oscar for it. The Background score in the movie is beautiful from Wojciech Kilar and Frederic Chopin and the music of piano in this movie is heart-warming.This is surely one of the best war movies ever, Brody's best acted performance of the character and one of Polanski's best.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

The Incredible,"The Pianist
The film named ""The Pianist"", is directed by Roman Polanski. It is an incredible movie that gently establishes the terrible story of the man who was struggling for survival in the horrors of WWII. The film is based on the autobiography of Polish-Jewish musician Wladyslaw Szpilman and portrays the brutality and destruction of the Holocaust while demonstrating the strength and endurance of the human mind.The horrors of the Holocaust are shown in ""The Pianist"" without pulling back, without praising the horrible events that its victims suffered. This is what makes the film unique. The graphic and realistic portrayal of brutality and suffering in the film makes it a heartbreaking symbol of the cost to humanity of war and genocide
The directing skill of Polanski is excellent, bringing the audience to the shocking and miserable environment of wartime Warsaw. The amazing switch between images of peace and chaos is magnificent. The captivating portrayal of Adrien Brody as Szpilman, the pianist, gives him sensibility, durability, and unimaginable level. His acting portrays the emotional details of survival, from terror and hopelessness to brief moments of hope and strength. Such a great actor with amazing acting skills.The fundamental message of ""The Pianist"" is that art and music can be encouraged regardless of the situation. Through unbearable pain, Szpilman's piano playing offers solace as a sign of tenacity and hope.It is a timeless reminder of the overcoming of humanity's determination over struggles because of its outstanding performances, brilliant direction, and powerful plot. ""The Pianist"" is a genuinely emotional and insightful film that will stay with you even after the ending credits have played. Let me conclude with my favorite quote from the movie,""If you prick us, do we not bleed?If you tickle us, do we not laugh?If you poison us, do we not die?And, if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?""The Pianist (2002).",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Music is stronger than any weapon,"Traditional World War II-era films focus on the battlefields, whether in Europe or the Pacific. In 2002's 'The Pianist,' we instead see what it's like to live as a civilian under German occupation, focusing specifically on the story of a Polish Jew who must do everything he can to survive over the course of the later years during the war.'Pianist' is really made what it is by Adrien Brody, whose Oscar-winning performance earned much praise from critics and audiences alike. Brody portrays Wladyslaw Szpilman, a pianist who plays on Poland's national radio broadcast. Close with his family, Szpilman eventually must learn to survive in the ghettos of Warsaw and beyond as he fights for his life against the Nazi forces. The story is a real one, which makes it that much more remarkable, but as powerful as it is on paper, it's a tough task to bring it to life onscreen. Fortunately, Brody is able to breathe life into the role, bringing the emotion and rawness needed to make it a respectful telling of the story.As a film itself, 'Pianist' doesn't feel lofty or overproduced. Instead, it accurately depicts the grittiness and horror of war, but still feels somewhat simple. The use of ambient sound over dialogue in long stretches of the film heightens the emotion and forces audiences to really pay attention to what they're seeing unfold on the screen. This is likely what helped Roman Polanski take home the Oscar for best director, despite his high profile personal issues. But the most powerful scene comes near the film's climax - a moment when Szpilman almost literally play for his life. This scene is by far the defining one in the film and will be remembered for years to come.'The Pianist' is a serious account of a dark part of history, but it tells a story that showcases how music can transcend parties, nationalities and allegiances.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Add onto your must see list.,"This film I can't put into enough words how hauntingly beautiful it was. Everything was done perfectly. Was captivated and moved deeply.

Both wonderful films, this one you get to see everything from the other point of view which I much prefer. I chose to review this film because my grandmother lost about half or more of her family during that gruesome time. It nauseates me to think this sick thing happened.

Roman Polanski has done an excellent job bringing this terrible and shocking era to the screen.However, as a humanitarian, I do have something to say about what the film means to me as regards the world in which we live and it is this: People can be compared to rats. They rarely think for themselves and all they want is an easy life. A person, any person, can rise from the hungry masses and having a way with words, promises that if they follow them then they can lead them towards a better food source. It's as simple as that.

"Strong survival story, without black-and-white approaches","As stories about vast sufferings such as genocide, holocaust, ethnic cleansing etc. are mostly revealed by sufferers-survivors, then they tend to be subjective and individualistic, full of hatred and grief, without so-called big picture, ""we"" are always good/right and ""they"" are always bad/wrong. Both the author of the autobiographical book (Władysław Szpilman) and its screenwriter (Ronald Harwood) have avoided the above and created a warmhearted, yet realistic and reasoned story about a Jewish family's fate around the events related to Warsaw Ghetto. The narration runs smoothly, we see people with different attitudes and characters among the Jews also, and not all Nazis were humiliators or ruthless killers... True, intellectuals such as musicians perceive the world in a different manner, they have more compassion and eagerness to understand rather than condemn, but still... The atmosphere is realistic, provides additional historical knowledge, and great choice of music plus talented aggregate direction makes The Pianist enjoyable to watch even if you the Szpilman's story (as I did not, the twists were additional value to me).The cast consists mostly of European actors (apart from Adrien Brody, but his father is of Polish Jewish descent), and Nazis were played by Germans. Of course, Brody is the greatest of them, besides, he spends most time on screen. I think he fully deserved his multiple awards, including Academy Award for Best Actor. But also the rest of the cast fitted into the atmosphere well - both by looks-wise and performance-wise.Altogether, The Pianist is a masterful panoramic narration and I liked it even more than Schindler's List.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

A haunting portrayal of survival and resilience,"""The Pianist,"" directed by Roman Polanski, is a powerful and haunting depiction of survival during one of history's darkest periods. Based on the true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Jewish pianist in Warsaw, the film captures his harrowing experiences during World War II.Adrien Brody delivers an exceptional performance as Szpilman, bringing depth and humanity to a character who endures unimaginable hardships. His portrayal is both subtle and compelling, earning him a well-deserved Academy Award for Best Actor. The film's cinematography and score are equally notable, enhancing the emotional weight of Szpilman's journey.While ""The Pianist"" excels in its technical and narrative execution, its somber and unrelenting depiction of the Holocaust can be overwhelming. The pacing at times feels slow, and the film's focus on Szpilman's isolation may leave viewers longing for more insight into the broader historical context.Despite these minor shortcomings, ""The Pianist"" is a poignant and impactful film that offers a deeply personal look at the resilience of the human spirit amidst the horrors of war. It's a significant cinematic achievement that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
A masterpiece,"There are some films that are so powerful and remarkable that they remain in the collective memory. This is one of them... not because it is a film about the Jewish holocaust, because there are a lot of films about that, but because of the raw way in which it approached it, without artifice or heroism. Directed with absolute mastery by Roman Polanski - himself a Holocaust survivor, with many harsh memories of the time, some of them used here - the film seeks to mirror the personal account of the difficulties experienced by Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Jewish pianist who worked on the radio when the Poland is invaded by Nazi Germany.I have not read the original account written by Szpilman, who would die at a time when the film was being made, but I give credit to Polanski's efforts. The director wanted a faithful, realistic and sincere account, and managed to turn his film into a historically faithful and credible portrayal of the facts and events that took place in Warsaw during the German invasion, including the occupation of the city, the forced relocation of Jews to the ghetto and transport to the extermination camps, the harsh living conditions experienced by those who lived in the ghetto and the way in which the Polish resistance and confined Jews collaborated to oppose the invaders, in a work that reached its peak with the Ghetto Revolt, suppressed with extreme violence, as we know. The pianist's story unfolds among all these facts, making Szpilman the eyewitness of all this. In the midst of absolute barbarism, dissonant notes that help us not to see reality in black and white: a Jewish police that collaborates with the Nazis by oppressing their ethnic brothers, a Polish housewife who does not hesitate to denounce that Jew that hides in the apartment next door, and a German officer who, against all odds, is willing to help him, even giving him his military coat, so he won't get cold. War and life have these things.Adrien Brody, still young, achieved with this film the most striking and powerful interpretation of his career to date. He's a great actor, he'll have a lot of opportunities to do something as good or better, but I have to admit that it's going to be difficult to give us something so powerful and intense. Next to him, we have good performances by Frank Finlay, Emilia Fox, Michal Zebrowski and Thomas Kretschmann, among other actors, all of them two or three steps below Brody.Technically, the film makes the most of the chosen filming locations in Warsaw, where filming was concentrated. The sets and costumes are loaded with detail and realism, transporting us to the time and historical context with a truly enviable rigor, worthy of a documentary. To this work, we have to associate impeccable and beautifully thought out cinematography, where light and color gradually disappear, as all the action progresses and the atrocities become more and more evident. There are also some very well executed CGI effects that take us through a city devastated by bombing and fighting. The tension and harshness of the events keep us stuck with the film until the end, and the brutality and destruction of the war are the icing on the cake. The soundtrack brings together a series of magnificent melodies by Chopin, a composer who knew how to explore the harmony and nostalgia of the piano as almost no one else knew how to do after him. Ironically or not, this Polish composer was anti-Semitic (like many people in his time), which did not prevent pianists of Jewish blood like Arthur Rubinstein from poring over his scores to the great delight of music lovers...",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

As for the main character himself, I can't say that he was a coward... he just couldn't take up arms. And to be completely honest, I'm not Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya either ... most likely, I would also be very scared. Shpilman did not become a traitor, but it should also be noted that he did not ask anyone for anything ... those who helped him did it voluntarily, they just wanted to keep his talent and his beautiful music. The film, in my opinion, turned out to be very truthful, most likely that's how it all happened.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Why the best movies of the year hardly ever get an Oscar?,"Well, I am kind of used to that the best movie of the year never gets an Oscar recently (save for Forrest Gump and American Beauty of course). Most flagrant mistakes of the Academy are their choice of Titanic over As Good as It Gets in 1998 and awarding Chicago over the Pianist in 2003. And the worst thing is that the Schindler's List which is in some points similar yet worse than the Pianist was awarded. Well there is no justice on earth.Anyway, the strongest point of this movie is the story. The survival of a jewish top pianist through the dreadful WW II in Warsaw, Poland. Of course, there have been numbers of movies like that but this one is so beautifully crafted that it leaves trails in your memory forever. After seing a movie like this one must be assured that the atrocities of WW II must never be forgotten.Couple the wonderful story with a great acting and cinematography and there is a masterpiece and you bet this one is.

Interesting Story of Survival,"Polanski does a solid job here in this story of not quite specifically the Holocaust but that event serves as the background for one person's struggle to survive through unimaginable challenges.

Harrowing tale,"Roman Polanski's The Pianist has earned recognition as one of the best films about Holocaust ever made. And for a good reason. Based on the memoirs of Wladyslaw Szpilman, it tells the story of him and his family trying to survive through the World War while at first harassed and then outright hunted by the Nazi government. It is the tale of Holocaust seen through one human fate. And while Szpilman's experiences were not the worst ones imaginable – if such things should even be measured – they are among the more unbelievable, showcasing his resilience, will to survive, and at times sheer dumb luck.Szpilman is played by Adrien Brody, and this is by far the best performance he has ever given. The role fits him like a glove, or perhaps it would be better to say that he fits the role like a glove, it's hard to say. Nevertheless, it's him that pulls you into the movie, into the journey through years filled with naught else but hardship, destruction, smoke and sorrow, with only brief moments of elusive hope. One of the more well-earned Academy Awards, I must say.Polanki's Academy Award for Directing was also well-earned in my opinion. Polanski's films have always had certain flair to them, an unmistakable style, but in this he has left out all of his usual lightheartedness and channeled all of his talent into making you see what it was really like to live through it all. And he succeeded. The pacing is iron tight and professional, the whole film looks amazing, all the scenes are poignant and interesting, all the dialogues work magnificently, all the characters are identifiable and memorable.

Thought Provoking,"I saw this film several nights ago and find myself still thinking about it several nights later. I will not bore other readers with a rehash of the plot, but I will say that this is certainly the most challenging film of about the Holocaust I have seen. Roman Polanski has delivered an amazing portrait of the horror and the beauty of human life. Polanski justly deserves every bit of praise and award he receives for being so honest and so skilled at delivering movie to the world. The role of randomness, fate and just blind luck in the survival of Szpilman, and by extension everyone who perished or survived those years, has humbled and horrified as a human being. That he survived to write out his story is amazing when you consider how many times he might have made the wrong turn, or said the wrong thing, knocked on the wrong door and met his end. That he survived and was able to write his story with unflinching honesty and without gloryfing his own actions is even more remarkable. How many of us could be so honest and not be tempted to cloak ourselves in heroic actions? Many people have commented on Szpilman apparent lack of heroism. They seem bothered that he was just a man who was pushed into freedom and helped along by many acts of kindness, as if this was a character flaw, that he would be more worth a movie if he had been more daring and noble. In an odd way it was his passiveness in the face of danger that in part gave him the chance to survive and then to tell his tale to the world. Szpilman, as a friend said to me, is an everyman, neither sinner or saint, hero or villian. None of us who have never experienced anything remotely akin to his situation can predict with honesty how they would behave if confronted with the same choices.  We would all like to think we would behave bravely, nobly and honestly, but we can never be sure what the deep desire to live would lead us to do in our human need to cling to life. I would also like to add my appreciation for Adrien Brody's remarkable performance. It was so subtle that it appeared not to be acting. This was a performance of remarkable depth. He deserves an Oscar, although I doubt he will receive it. Subtle and understated never is well appreciated. I recommend this movie to anyone who has an ounce of taste and love of filmaking as an art. This will be something that will stay with you long after you leave the theater.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Intelligent and Powerful,"""The Pianist"" is the kind of assured, confident movie that only an older director can make.  Sure, directors like Wes Anderson and Quentin Tarantino have exhibited prowess beyond their relatively young years, but the allure of a seasoned professional is unmistakable and inimitable.  He knows you'll be impressed through sheer storytelling magic, and won't jump through hoops to get the audience from point A to point B.I have read Michael Medved's deliriously inane comments on film and film criticism, and he wrote Roman Polanski's best work since ""Chinatown"" off as simply a ""Holocaust drama.""  I disagree.  Yes, the main character is Jewish in the nineteen thirties and forties, and the Holocaust is used as a backdrop, but this is a simple story of survival.  Ronald Harwood's screenplay does not go into tons of exposition about who the Nazis are or what they're doing there, and doesn't use insulting little title cards to sum up the situation at the beginning of the film.  It respects the audience's intelligence.  We know what the Nazis did, and it doesn't labor the point.Polanski is gentle, yet masterful, letting the story flow instead of yanking it one way or the other.  It uses a minimum of dialogue, and doesn't try to convince us of what is wrong or right.  It expects us to know better, and therefore doesn't enforce a kind of ham-handed moral high ground that would be easy to trip over in a film like this.  It accepts everyone involved as human beings instead of faceless and soulless killing machines in gray.The centerpiece of the film is Adrian Brody's performance as Wladyslaw Szpilman, the Polish piano player who watched his family get packed on a train heading to a concentration camp.  With Polanski's spare direction and Harwood's lack of dialogue, Brody is the only thing to focus on.  One should not underestimate how daunting of a challenge this really is.  Actors have broken under lesser pressure, and something like this requires whoever plays the part to immerse himself wholly in the role; to become the character instead of looking like an actor going through the motions.  Brody more than rises to the challenge.  The soldier from Malick's ""The Thin Red Line"" and the punker from Lee's ""Summer of Sam"" vanish.  Brody is Szpilman, it's as simple as that.  The feat is superhuman.""The Pianist"" is everything a great movie should be.  The direction, writing, acting, and everything else are exemplary.  All so much so that they become invisible.**** out of 4",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

"The Pianist, a good film about the Second World War","There are a lot of Second World War survival films which show the experience of Jews, but The Pianist is different. The Pianist tells the story of how Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish Jew pianist and composer, survived the Holocaust by hiding in Warsaw, with help from the Polish resistance. Although Szpilman does all he can to save himself, he is not a hero because he would have died without good luck and the kindness of a few non-Jews (Remember the unexpected assistance he receives from a German officer, a Nazi music lover, in the final days of the German occupation). So much of the film concerns this character alone, so it seems emotionally distanced. However, we are reminded of the war, the brutality of the Nazis and a lot of atrocities, and we also learn something new from the perspective of a unique survivor. The horrors of that experience contrasts with the delicacy of the music which performs the pianist.I like realistic films, and I think The Pianist is an important one because it put us in the Warsaw Ghetto, presenting a devastating moment in history that we, fortunately, did not live in. This film makes you think about war and its consequences. The fact that Wladyslaw Szpilman survived is not a victory when all his loved ones died. Please, just think about the suffering, the impotence and the grief of this man. Everybody could be a pianist.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

The first time I saw this film, my mind was filled with the horror of the story - and my alarm at some of the fairly unpalatable comments others had posted.This time too, I find myself almost overcome with emotion but now because of the music, which somehow seemed incidental to me before. The scene where a ravaged Szpilman plays Chopin (Ballad No. 1 in G Minor, Op. 23) for the German officer left me shattered. The beauty and sheer elegance of the piece simply annihilates darkness for as long as it lasts and its memory provides a benchmark for the human spirit when the last note has faded. Even in the midst of the incomprehensible darkness of the Holocaust there was still light, even if it was only able to shine in the hearts of people able to remember its warmth.I consider myself an informed music lover but I believe this is the first time in my life I've ever truly understood its deepest beauty. For me this confirms The Pianist as a truly great film. It's certainly not unflawed but if a definition of Art is that which provokes genuine realisation in its audience then Polanski has here become an artist.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Excellent!,"At first one's impression of this film when reading about it's content, which is about a Jewish pianists real life accounts of the holocaust, is you've seen a lot about this so why see another.  Yet this film is really compelling and by having it focus meticulously on one individuals struggles, makes it even more gripping.  Sure one may have read all about the atrocities in their history books, but actually seeing a mass group of Jews herded into a windowless train car and then locked in is really shattering.Director Polanski spreads this and other disturbing scenes throughout the film at unannounced intervals.  This is much more effective than just bunching them up into one section.  It truly gives you a very real taste of the daily tension and fear that the people must of felt.Some critics have already christened this as Polanski's best film. Before seeing it you would have to wonder if these people had really seen all of Polanski's pictures.  After all this man has done alot of great movies.  Yet after seeing it I would probably have to agree.  The lighting, pacing, editing, acting, music, camerawork, and set design come together in a flawless chemistry.  Not just a a particular point, but throughout.  It also has a couple of really amazing shots.  One is a long shot showing row upon row of bombed out buildings.  It is really breathtaking especially when you fathom in how they were actually able to do it.This is a very solid film that is well worth you time both as a educational and informative work.  There are parts of this that should stay with you long after it is over.  It definitely merits the best picture Oscar.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

Probably I've never been touched by a movie like this one.It's not only a biography of a great pianist, it's a documentary about a whole era, a documentary about thousands of people that suffered years ago, that lived, suffered and died, about their everyday lives and their everyday experiences.I've read much about the second world war and I thought that I knew how it was like and how people suffered, until I saw that movie, it made me see with my own eyes what my brain couldn't imagine, the film took me back in time and space, I was in Warsaw feeling every Jewish lived there that time.Also the movie portrayed the life and experience of Wladyslaw Szpilman flawlessly, in times I was feeling him, I was somehow suffering while I'm lying in my bed crying over someone that has already died 16 years ago.The soundtrack fits the events perfectly, the visuals are not impressing but that actually helped concentrating on the emotional aspect.I have never thought that a film could touch me this way, made me think about my real life now and thankful more than ever that we are living in peace and not suffering, it also made me think about all the people that suffers in our days, having a more clear picture about how wars and suffering could be like.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
"MASTERPIECE of Hollywood, I'm SPEECHLESS!!!!!!","The movie The pianist, is the masterpiece of Hollywood, I watched this movie a month before just because it's name was fascinating, but this movie proved to be a masterpiece of Hollywood. I will regret not saying that this movie is the BEST movie that I ever watched in my life. I watched this movie without German being translated into English, but still that movie fascinated me so much that I rated this movie 10/10, which I usually do not do. I can say that it is a big mistake not to watch this movie. Anybody who understands what a movie is and can feel what a movie can be like will find that this is the Best movie ever. The acting in this movie is impeccable, the direction is exceptionally outstanding, the presentation of movie is magnificent, and Script so exquisite that it makes you lost inside the movie and make you feel respect and admiration for the movie makers and also the performers. There are many scenes in the movie that alone deserve Oscars, but unfortunately, this movie received only 3 Oscars, it is a pity that people were not able to understand the movie, as I cannot imagine something better than this.The scene in which a hungry man eats the food from the road, and the woman beating him is worth 10 Oscars. The squabbling between the brothers, the slapping of Wladislaw's father by the German soldiers, Snatching the newspaper from his sister Halina, Cruelities of the Germans on the Jews and throwing the man out of the window, making people run and shooting them, killing of the young child stealing food from the forbidden area, Wladislaw's struggle for his survival and being caught by a German officer, Killing of old laborers, Stuffing of people inside the train and removing them, Wladislaw's supporting the young Jews and polish by hiding armors in the food and then throwing them off the wall, drinking of contaminated water in the destroyed hospital, eating rotten potato etc. are some of the scenes of the movie that, HONESTLY, WILL MAKE YOU EMOTIONAL AND SO MUCH IMPRESSED THAT YOU ARE LEFT SPEECHLESS, HOW TO PRAISE THE MOVIE, THIS IS THE MOST OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE OF Hollywood, IN MY VIEW THIS MOVIE DESERVES 100,000 Oscars.This movie is no way less than Titanic, however it can be more than TITANIC.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
one of the greats,"Over this past weekend two emotionally moving events happened.  First, I saw ""the pianist"": Second, I went on a church retreat.  Now I have been going to my church retreats for a number of years and they are almost always the highlight of the month, let alone the weekend.  But I would have to say that the pianist moved me more then the retreat.  I know this is pretentious but I just wanted to say it to emphasize the greatness of this film.In my mind, if Shindler's List was ranked #7 on AFI ""100 years, 100 movies"", then this movie would have to be ranked somewhere between #1-6.  Of course I don't think Shindler's List is the #7 movie of all time and I doubt ""The Pianist"" is in the top ten, either (though maybe the top 20), but that is beside the point.This movie highlights what very few movies dare to say.  This is that it is not enough mearly to survive, but to survive as a human being.  This point is stated multiple times throughut the film (i.e. ""I'm cold""; when Szpilman expresses his emotions through a moving score with the German; how Szpilman eats the Jam plain without the bread like a small child; etc., etc.), and is really what makes the film great.  Brody really expresses how close to an emotional zombie Szpilman comes, without (in the end) eventually becoming one.  I think the reason that the film came across so powerfully, without being sentamental, was that Polanski was there.  I know this has been said before and will be said again, but I don't think it can be under-emphized.  P.T. Anderson makes great films about ""the valley"" because he lived there, Spielberg makes great films about family relations because he was very hurt when his partent divorced, Quintin Tarintino makes great films about low-lifes partially because for many years he lived and interacted with lowlifes as a video clerk in L.A.  Polanski was able to make a great film about the holocost becuase he was there.And to all of you who have previously said that Brody flatlines on his acting I feel you have unfortunelty mistaken bad acting with suttle acting.Overall this is maybe one of the greatest films of all time10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
"Too much of a bad thing? Read, I'll explain...","I liked this movie. It was good but, it could have been great (ie Schindler's List, Life is Beautiful) The reason it was not, I felt, was it was excessive. After seeing that many innocent jews executed, killed in battle, or beaten on the street, one just becomes desensitized to it. By the end of the film, I don't believe I felt, or was capable of feeling, anything. I guess the fault lies not entirely with the film. I suppose with the excess of violence this generation is exposed to everyday, Polanski probably felt he needed that much killing in plain sight to tap our emotions. Yet past movies depicting the holocaust have done a much finer job of imprinting how terrible a tragedy it was, and that's why they are great.But maybe I am wrong - Maybe Polanski was not trying to make a great (in the sense I've been using the word) film, but a simpler story about one man's amazing survival.

Not the best but still damn good...,"If I was an inch more sensitive I would've cried my eyes out. This film is heart-wrenching, a real weepy about the true story of some polish pianist whose name I cannot spell nor pronounce, who was left all alone in the Warsaw ghetto during WW2. Adrien Brody is sublime as the pianist. A man inspired by music to survive, a man who hid and tried to live even though his family had been taken cruelly by the Nazis. The film is slow and some scene of the Nazi brutality is shocking and sad. One man, a disabled inferiority who tries to protest about what the Germans are doing as they storm his house is shocking, and the pianist sees it all. The poor man is lifted in his wheelchair and is thrown over the balcony of the high rise house he lived in. that is one of the more brutal scenes, and the film is well made as all the brutality is shown from the pianist's point of view, and to know that this guy witnessed all this is very disturbing. Roman Polanski shows flair in his fantastic directing and the overall film is well worth watching. The only problem is that the ending is rather ridiculous, whether it happened or not. The part where he emerges from the derelict house which one friendly German has helped him hide in in a German coat and is then promptly shot at (not hit) by a Russian liberation troop is made farcical when they say ""Why are you wearing that coat?"" and he replies ""I'm cold"" - that is quite ridiculous and this rather silly emphasis on the liberation isn't powerful enough. I think they should have left this out and had the scene fade to the scene where the pianist's German helper is being held in a POW camp thing. Another reason is that The Pianist is nowhere near as good as Schindler's List, no questions... It is good and deserves some good recognition and viewings from everyone. It is good and deserves an 8",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

Excellent and realistic,"The pianist is a historical drama directed by Roman Polanski. It is based on an autobiographical book written by Wladyslaw Szpilman. Adrien Brody played the of the talented Jewish pianist, Wladyslaw Szpilman. Adrien Brody won Oscar for this movie. Also the movie won awards in almost all categories.It's a story about the struggle of the pianist to survive the Nazi occupation of Poland during world war 2. Wladyslaw Szpilman was the greatest piano player of Poland in 1930's who lived in Warsaw. Movie is centered about the transition period of Jews at Warsaw after the first attack of Germany in 1939. I have no words to describe the horror of that holocaust due to German attack but the movie shows it and you will feel the horror while watching it. Little hopes of the Jews during that hard times keep the movie alive.The director Roman Polanski was also in Poland during the attack. He also had unforgettable memories related to world war 2. There were many rise and falls in his life which were a source of inspiration for making such movies.The movie is not made just for the entertainment of the audience. It's a slow paced and a bit long movie but the emotional attachment and sympathy with the characters will keep you engaged till the end. There are lot of things to learn from this movie as it exposes the harsh realities of world war 2.The struggle and the efforts made by the pianist in that hopeless situation is a true source of inspiration for each of us.

An Underrated Genius,"Perhaps because he generally works in a direct, naturalistic style and in a variety of genres, Roman Polanski could quite possibly be the most underrated filmmaker working today--which makes a film like `The Pianist' all the more startling. It's unexpected filmmaking, a complex yet measured account of Jewish life in wartime Warsaw, both in the ghetto and outside of it, filmed, as always, in Polanski's clean, simple style with beautiful camerawork (by Pawel Edelman) and evocative lighting. Though it may appear cold and methodical, Polanski's passion is subversively striking. Based on pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman's memoir (unread) and adapted in an admirably economical fashion by Ronald Harwood, his story probably serves as a counterpoint to Polanski's own: the end titles reveal Szpilman remained in Poland until his death in 2000 whereas Polanski has essentially exiled himself from his native land and there's a sense of wistfulness in his recreation of the time; Warsaw is displayed as a peaceful urban center disrupted only by the advent of Nazism and, with one notable exception, the Poles are depicted as concerned citizens given to either helping or at least ignoring the Jews. Although it's as brutal to watch as `Schindler's List' (there are some short images that are truly troubling) the comparisons are not quite apt: whereas `Schindler's List' concerned itself with the Holocaust as a topic in and of itself, `The Pianist' seems intrigued not only with that subject but also with art's critical importance in a crisis society: not only is it a savior in troubled times but it's the bridge that bonds victim and barbarian; Polanski seems intent on providing a no-fuss definition of art that can have meaning to any audience. Adrien Brody plays the title role, subtly moving from cocksure artist to emaciated blank canvas for the director to project his fears and wonders. Absolutely outstanding, the work of a true cinematic genius.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

If it appears boring to you, then you are lost, for you remember not, nor have interest in history and are bound one sad day, to repeat it.This movie is not happy, nor should it be, but the horrible truth it speaks (yet only of one life here) needs to be poured like salt over our minds as we watch true atrocity; to keep the wounds raw, so as not to forget; ever.I give it 10/10 for keeping the brutality of history alive in our hearts, thereby adjusting our perspective on life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

One of the best holocaust films made,"The Pianist stars Adrien Brody as the titular character Wladyslaw Szpilman, a famous pianist living in Warsaw, Poland, during the second world war. While it has standard holocaust fare about the Jews being mistreated, you can't help but feel anger and sorrow at the sights of children being shot and piled up in the streets. The story revolves around how Wladyslaw tried to survive in the war torn city by hiding behind cupboards, living in the ruins of bombed houses or in apartments in which he was not allowed to make a single noise for fear of giving himself away.Roman Polanski is in another world in this film. He himself was a victim of the German Nazi mistreatment and harassment as he lived during the war and he makes us feel as if we are too. He deserved the Academy Award which he received for this film. Only he could convey all the intense feelings of fear and depression of the Jews. The scenes were stark and violent at times and at others would bring a smile to your face. There is a marvelous scene in which Wladyslaw is in an apartment secretly and cannot make a single sound as the Germans will then hear him. He sees a piano in the same room and sits down to play it. We see his shoulders and head moving to music and hands moving as if he was playing and we even hear the music in the air. As we start to think that they will surely hear and start to fear, the camera shows that his hands are merely moving above the piano keys and we realize with relief and regret that he is not in reality making any sound, as the music is all in his head.Adrien Brody is simply superb in this true story, playing a man who spends most of his screen time being quiet and not making a sound. His body language and facial expressions convey enough emotions to carry the entire film. He rightfully deserved the Academy Award, which he won at the age of 29 making him the youngest actor till date to win the award. He touches your heart and stays there. His role is definitely one i wouldn't be able to forget for a long time.While the film is about the atrocities on the Jews, and for most of the part shows the inhumane and degrading conditions in which the Nazis make the Jews live in, the film doesn't make one want to run home and turn on Inglorious Basterds while throwing darts at a dartboard with a Hitler portrait on it. This effect was deliberate as it shows that not all who serve under the devil are demons. Roman Polanksi must be lauded for this open minded view considering that he himself was treated deplorably by the Nazis.The story is simple yet will capture you and is one of the most classic true stories and the cinematography is memorable. Its the score that really stands out, especially the parts of the piano. The music is haunting and expertly performed. The acting of the rest of the cast, while it doesn't really stand out, is acceptable. The film is high on emotions and if you haven't seen any holocaust film before then is the right place to start. Watch it for one of the most legendary roles in the form of the pianist and for the unforgettable piece of world war 2 history.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

Calmness reflects the message!,"I've been a fan of Polanski since my teenage years. Sure, he might have his personal issues, but when it comes to directing, he's pretty much spot on every time! He sticks to his guns and doesn't let the big studio heads sway him.This film is a straightforward tale about a Polish Jew and classical musician who made it through the war thanks to a mix of resilience and luck. Polanski didn't turn it into a thriller or try to ramp up the tension or emotions; he simply shares Szpilman's experiences and what he went through. With Szpilman portrayed by Adrien Brody, who is also Jewish, the director made an excellent choice - I think it's one of Brody's finest roles! He captures Szpilman as someone who took music seriously from a young age, knows his talent, and has a bit of a detached view of the world around him. He often reassures others that things will be okay.I've seen some critiques of ""The Pianist"" saying it feels too distant and lacks urgency. I actually admire Polanski for that choice. That calmness reflects his message. By depicting Szpilman as a survivor rather than a fighter or a hero-someone who does what he can to stay alive but relies heavily on luck and the kindness of a few non-Jews-Polanski highlights that in war, survival isn't about being a certain nationality; it's just a tragic game of chance.

Brody is magnificent, I hope he can keep his face more-or-less anonymous.Another great statement to show the dangers of war and hatred!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Powerful Masterpiece! 8/10,"Review: I know that I'm a bit late with this movie, 13 years to be exact but now that I've watched it, I must admit, it is a powerful masterpiece. The movie is about a talented, Jewish pianist who uses all of his resources to escape from German soldiers during World War II. After splitting up from his family, he is left to fend for himself in a Warsaw ghetto, whilst fighting for food and cover. The acting from Adrien Brody was superb, especially when times were extremely hard for his character and the storyline was put together very well by Roman Polanski. I was a bit skeptical about the length of the film before watching it but it really didn't seem that long because of the detailed content and amazing cinematography. The ironic ending was shocking and surprising, which added to his amazing journey were he really hit rock bottom. I still find it hard to believe that it was a true story and it was one of those films were it takes some time to get out of that mode after watching it. Anyway, I'm not going to praise it anymore because I think you can tell that I really enjoyed it. Its hard to find a fault with the film so it has to get the thumbs up from me. Brilliant!Round-Up: I don't think that Adrien Brody, 42, has put in such a perfect performance since making this movie. I liked him in the Grand Budapest Hotel, Detachment, the Darjeeling Limited and Cadillac Records but his performance in this movie was excellent and he deserved the Oscar for a leading role. Personally, I like his acting style and he can comfortably switch genres with ease but the lack of good scripts are holding him back. He as proved that he can take on any challenge that is put in front of him but he hasn't hit the peak that he reached in 2002. Anyway, the movie was made by the acclaimed director, Roman Polanski, 82, who has been surrounded by controversy after being convicted of statutory rape on a 13 year old girl. Polanski then fled the USA to avoid prison so his movie making career was put on hold for some time. He's famous for making Rosemary's Baby, Chinatown, Frantic, Bitter Moon, the Ninth Gate and Oliver Twist but his real comeback movie had to be this one. He also won a best director Oscar for this movie but he lost out to Chicago for the best picture. Polanski had his own personal experience with Nazis during World War II were he sadly lost his mother and was separated from his father for some time so this movie came from the bottom of his heart and you really can see it on screen.Budget: $35million Worldwide Gross: $120millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their war/drama movies about a talented Jewish pianist who is on the run from German soldiers. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
A Movie that Overcame Comfort,"Was it really two and a half hours?  I wanted the movie to go on.  Maybe a more personable ""Schindlers"".  Strikingly potent story that kept me involved at every moment.

When life is a terrible and beautiful reality.,"A real, cruel and ruthless face of humanity. A story that marks you to the surface and will hit you without fear, a round vision of what is called war, death and life.This movie is a vivid reflection of what we can not be again as rational humans. His real story is so moving and at the same time sad, that there we see what an artist or ordinary person had to face in the midst of ruthless war.Like him, many other stories were silenced by the bullets and massacres that those ""superior"" beings, in their delirium or anger, exercised.Beautiful, sad, but real.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
The Pianist,"Facing the suffering, rubbing shoulders with the God of death several times, history is heavy like a hysterical crying person, whimpering and lamenting, but no voice can be heard. The interlude between William hosenfeld and schipperman flickers in the suffering notebook as unimportant but precious.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Oscar Bound,"""The Pianist"" is poignant, disturbing and chilling, yet, somehow remains encouraging and hopeful.  The great lengths at which one will go to survive, or at which others will assist in survival while risking their own lives is encouraging and hopeful, reminding us to be mindful of one another and accepting of each others differences.The acting is sensational!  I would declare an Oscar nomination is in store for Adrien Brody. The transformation he undergoes is nothing short of brilliant!  He is subtle and natural.  At times there is literally no dialogue and in the silence there is greatness achieved.  Jessica Kate Meyer is also exceptional as is Ed Stoppard, Maureen Lipman, Frank Finlay and so many others right down to the extras that were cast.This film is graphic.  You want to close your eyes, but it forces us to recognize that we cannot close our eyes to hatred and the destruction of humanity.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Broken and freed,This movie to me is the near perfect encapsulation of someone being broken down to their breaking point and then after each trial and after each encounter shifting and adapting to the situation they are presented with. The man from the start of the movie The pianist is still just that a pianist and watching him struggle through this war torn land that was once his home was a shocking and brilliant spectical to watch. The feelings of dread in the middle of the movie and the moving score all made better during the scene with Chopin only helped the movie to be one of the finest I have watched in my lifetime.,10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

"Haunting, Timeless, Unforgettable, Uplifting...One for the Ages","Although not nearly as epic and emotionally devastating as ""Schindler's List"", Roman Polanski's deeply personal ""Pianist"" is by many measures a greater film and a work of true cinematic art. Haunting, cold, and austere where other films are sentimental and clichéd; true to the horrors of human existence where other films play for shock and gore; poignantly quiet where other films are overwhelmed by a swelling music score; darkly comic where other films don't even dare speak a word; and universally compelling where other films are specific and preachy (though a fact based Holocaust tale, this could have been anyone's tale of triumph over the horrors of man's brutality towards each other and could speak to a tribal warrior in Somalia or Palestinian separatist just as much as it does to a Jew from Poland). This is a film deeply rooted in the ethereal realm of the timeless artistic representation of man's struggle against adversity and our innate will to survive.I can't remember the last time I watched a film and was so transported into the world the director created (I think only ""Mulholland Drive"" has done this for me in recent years) and yet was so aware of the artistic nature of it all. I don't think I've ever sat through a film before and thought during so many scenes ""this is one for the ages."" My personal favorite scenes are the shot of the snow covered street running through a bombed out post-apocalyptic Warsaw and the eerily poetic shot of the German officer standing by the car on that very street at night underneath the full moon while the sounds of the piano playing from a bombed out building break the serene silence.The seamless editing and style of direction are purely European old school, and work wonderfully to keep the viewer entranced and spellbound by the state of Poland during WWII and the state of man's soul during times of tribulation. Polanski, working possibly from his own memories of his childhood in Poland during the Holocaust as well as by the actual accounts of his protagonist, gives this powerful tale its heart through the details (i.e. the family sharing the caramel while waiting to be taken away to the death camps). I can imagine sitting through this film a dozen times and still not catching everything. Half of the time I wasn't even sure what some of the details meant (like when he was playing piano at the ghetto club and one of the patrons asked him to stop playing so he could hear the sounds some coins made when he flipped them on the tabletop). Polanski clearly respects his audience as well as his characters and story. Sometimes we have to figure it out for ourselves what was the purpose of a certain scene or certain piece of dialogue (like when the German officer remarks that Szpilman, which only people with knowledge of foreign languages would know means ""player,"" is a very appropriate name for a pianist). It's this kind of attention to detail and respect for characters, setting, and audience alike that separate the good films from the great ones, and the movies from the works of art. This is a great work of art, and one of the greatest films of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Absolutely mesmerizing,I lived through this period. Americans were unaware of the atrocities in Poland until the end of the war. This movie grips you and the suspense never ceases. I can understand now why Jews fight with such fervor for their right to exist. Polanski and Brody are magnificent. 10 is my vote.,10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
An Ode to the Triumph of the Human Spirit,"The Pianist is one of the most beautiful movies ever made. It describes the life of Polish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman, a meek, ordinary man living in Warsaw when World War II starts. His life up until then is a bed of roses: he's a young, attractive man, and he plays piano over the radio. People know him and admire him.The war changes everything and all of a sudden Szpilman, a Jew, becomes one of the many victims of Nazi Germany. What the movie depicts is the complete breakdown of his ordinary life and his struggle to survive in the Warsaw Ghetto, hidden from the authorities.Directed by Roman Polanski, the movie is evidently brutal in its depiction of cruelty, or rather the banality of cruelty. Polanski shows horrible acts in the most, non-dramatic fashion: wheelchair-bound people being thrown off windows; children being beaten to death; people being shot for asking questions. He shows Szpilman and his family breaking apart: they go to the camps, with the certainty of death; Szpilman manages to run and becomes a wanderer in the empty Ghetto, surviving thanks to the good will of people, and to his own resourcefulness. Hidden in an apartment, he witnesses the world from a window, waiting for the end. From here he witnesses the Uprising, a heroic but failed attempt by the Jews to fight back the Nazis.Bleak as the movie is, The Pianist also has a lot of humor, even some comic relief, as well as an emphasis on the brighter side of human existence. It's quite easy to create misery and draw pity from a viewer. But Only great art knows that life is never simple or reducible to one view. Darkness and light, ugliness and beauty, despair and humor always exist hand-in-hand. No scene shows that more accurately than the ending, in which Szpilman is saved by the most unlikely of people.Adrien Brody is magnificent in this movie. Although he's not an actor I like, because he seems to take a personal glee in choosing horrible movies to star in, he nevertheless gives life-defining performance here, as the embodiment of the human will to survive against all adversities. Thomas Kretschmann, in his short role, was unforgettable too.After decades making masterworks, Roman Polanski was finally rewarded with an Oscar. Not only that but he was rewarded for one of his best movies. Ronald Harwood, who adapted Szpilman's autobiography, also deserved his Oscar, as well as Brody himself. On a final note, Pawel Edelman, the director of cinematography, contributed to making this movie the wonder it is, in his composition of every shot. His work in this movie should put him alongside great DPs like Roger Deakins and Robert Richardson. Great movies are a synthesis of many aspects, and few movies bring them together so seamlessly and perfectly as The Pianist.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
A portrait of Poland at the WWII,"There are very few films of the Holocaust that aren't huge in scope, and often cover the tragedies of that time. ""The Pianist"" isn't as bloody or deathly as ""Schindler's List"" but it definitely shows that survivors came out of it due to pure luck, and that life is very fragile. Adrien Brody as the pianist, Szpilman, lives in the Warsaw Ghetto and after his family is taken to concentration camps, he must survive on luck and his own willpower. He works manual labor and hides at every opportunity. The film is very tense, because his fate is often uncertain, and his allies are often thwarted for their immeasurable help in hiding him. Brody gives an impeccable and heart wrenching performance, starting out with his family and trying to remain light about the situation, but eventually he becomes frail and hollow inside. The film is a shocking depiction of the war, as it should be, and comes from the uncommon perspective of a direct survivor. Haunting and absolutely horrifying, ""The Pianist"" broaches its subject with thoughtfulness and care.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
They haven't got Oscars for nothing! Totally worth it!!,"It's so sad yet so beautiful. It's totally worth watching for what actually happened during WWII. The length of the movie is not even a concern because you yourself want to know what's coming next. It's brilliantly well written and amazingly adapted by Roman Polanski.

I must mention separately about Adrien Brody's performance. He played the character really well and was detail accurate.
Also I learnt from this motion picture that Piano hits different when you're sad. So try it next time.

WWII Horror Encapsulated,"The Pianist is like a semi-biographical picture for Roman Polanski (he felt an affinity with the story and characters), even though the film itself is very much based on a real man who suffered the true horrors of Nazi Germany trying to exterminate the Jewish population from the face of the Earth. Roman didn't pull his punches with criticising war itself; and everything the concept corrupts and perverts.It's kind of a given this film is NOT for the faint-hearted, because the theme of ostracism from society and being wiped out kind of goes hand-in-hand with these intimate WWII movies. The Pianist is like an even more gut-punching journey than the likes of Schindler's List (if that's even possible). Whereas that movie focused on one man's struggles to save a group of Jews throughout the war, The Pianist focuses on one man just struggling to survive from the get-go, having to make do with circumstances rather than some kind of grand intervention or great helper to ease the pain. It's a survival story: and The Pianist is determined to make sure no viewer finishes the film untouched.The film's 'war scenes' (where people get shot) feel pretty goddamn real and impactful, and their more grounded choreography is a far cry from Hollywood's sometimes overly-choreographed scenes in WWII movies, and that might have something to do with The Pianist having those humble European production values that can easily outshine their Hollywood contemporaries. Needless to say, this film does everything right, desperate optimism (through survival), harrowing scenes and all.The Pianist (5/5 stars) is a must-watch through and through. But you MIGHT need some counselling afterwards.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
Power of Music,"I love films that glorify the power of music or even the power of movies, and what they can do for people because it's something that I have been directly impacted with. Movies and music have both gotten me through the hardest of times no matter the genre. A film has the ability to give the audience an escape route from their normal life. Now The Pianist shows this on a much different scale and exemplifies it in a different way, but I love the idea of the power of music or film so it's safe to say I really liked The Pianist.It tells the true story of a Jewish man from Warsaw Germany in the midst of World War II and the numerous life threatening struggles he went through along the countless amount of helpful and hurtful people he ran into. Adrien Brody stars as Wladyslaw Szpilman and plays him beautifully. I use that word because the film deals with the touchy subject of World War II, and in particular, the Holocaust. But there is a certain beauty to the way the film presents the subject. I especially like the way the Germans are represented, in that not all of them were as brutal as Hitler. In fact there are several generous Germans throughout that give Szpilman a hand. With that being said, it is devastating to see the hundreds of bodies you say laying in the streets of Warsaw, and without being paid really any attention. It still shocks me just how inhumane people can be to other people, and what the human race is capable of. A film like this can serve as a reminder to that, and is one of the better war films I have seen.It was also fascinating to watch the piano side of this character's story. For most of the film, he had to hold all of his emotions in while playing for people during this enduring time. The piano served as such a great juxtaposition for the terrible and beautiful side of the war. The film also looks fantastic in terms of the set pieces and the way Germany is represented. Polanski really nailed that aspect of it. It's also worth mentioning just how good Thomas Kretschmann is in his small but pivotal role. Overall, I thought The Pianist was a heartbreaking but beautiful film.+Piano juxtaposition+Set pieces+Germany is represented realistically8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"

Absolute brilliance,"I rarely ever spend my time posting a review for a movie but after having watched The Pianist I feel compel to do so.This is easily the best movie I have since in a long time.  Definitely the best Holocaust movie.  Easily the best war movie.  The directing and acting were brilliant.  Some of the scenes are so memorable.  The piano works by Chopin are ever so beautifully rendered.It is a shame that a movie like this one is only showing in limited release in a city like Toronto while Maid in Manhattan, Just Married, and other Hollywood junk are showing everywhere and breaking the box office.Best Picture Best Director: Roman Polanski Best Actor: Adrian Brody Best Cinematography",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, Music"
