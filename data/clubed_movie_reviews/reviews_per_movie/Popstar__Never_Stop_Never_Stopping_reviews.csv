Made My Face Hurt,"The excessive world of modern pop is so soulless and pretentious, it's ripe picking for drama. The mental breakings of stars like Mariah Carey, Britney Spears, Michael Jackson and others show an inherent flaw in how human beings are turned into oblivious money-making commodities, and then unceremoniously spit-out when their glimmer dies. Popstar, the brain child of the YouTube-turned-SNL stars The Lonely Island, touches on these things enough, but mostly it's just fantastic jokes. A timely and lightning-fast musical mockumentary, I could barely catch my breath from laughing. The story works as a parallel to the careers of the three Lonely Island guys themselves. Conner4Real (Samberg) is an international popstar who has grown beyond the popularity of his two Style Boyz partners (Taccone, Schaffer). While it uses that parallel effectively, it never becomes overbearing. Instead what shines are the original songs, a staple of these guys past endeavors, including their groundbreaking ""SNL Digital Shorts"" segments. Each one is an instant classic (i.e. ""I'm So Humble"", ""Things in My Jeep""), played ridiculously as if they have influenced real musicians, many of whom make hilarious cameos. For those of you old enough to remember the comedy classic ""Spinal Tap"", this format may seem somewhat familiar. However, a distractingly blatant rip-off this is not. It uses its 30-year separation as a way to point out the modern massive difference between actual artistic influence and silly cultural nostalgia that permeates the musical landscape. And while it doesn't quite reach Spinal-Tap-heights of greatness, if you're looking for a perfect friends-night-out, this is a comedy you will be happy to visit and revisit over and again.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
He just never stopped,"This is my review of Popstar Never Stop Never Stopping (spoiler free)**** (4/5)Cast: Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone, Akiva Schaffer, Sarah Silverman, Tim MeadowsPlot: The life of superstar musician Conner4Real (Samberg) appears to be a charmed one, filled with groupies, screaming crowds and sacks of cash. But trouble is on the horizon in the form of a scheming rapper (Chris Redd), a disastrous merchandise deal and a swarm of killer bees.The spirit of This is Spinal Tap looms large over the latest comedy from the Lonely Island Crew. Like Rob Reiner's masterpiece, it's a mockumentary and a fun one at that with laughs coming out of the whazoo. It follows three likable idiots as they navigate the choppy waters of the music biz. There is even an update of Tap's 'Sh*t Sandwich' scene, as Conner4Real (Andy Samberg in possibly his funniest role ever) checks out reviews of his new album: rather than showing a star rating, Rolling Stone awards it the poop emoticon. Happily, rather than coming off as a pale imitation, Popstar: Never Sop Never Stopping squeezes laughs out of its tale like juice from a plum. However if the music industry was silly in the 1980s this certainly shows how silly it was but it's even daft now, and Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone and Akiva Schaffer gleefully go to town sending up its absurdities. Conner4Real is an ear studded jackass, whose humongous entourage includes an eyebrow specialist, a scarf caddy (that's a real thing) and a guy who punches him in the nuts to remind where he came from.Weirdly he has an army of personalized holograms that caper around the stage. Conner is a narcissist who uploads daily videos to Youtube, and who his best friend Owen (Taccone) to wear a deadmau5-like helmet that emits a terrifying light beacon and makes an ominous sound that is likely to deafen anybody that passes by. However Conner, is an attention seeker and there is nothing that he won't do to get attention – a trait that is consistently hilarious – and, given Miley's twerking and Kanye's tweet-based rants, it is all too plausible today. Hot Rod, which is the Lonely Island's film about a wannabe Evel Knievel, was at times hysterical, but lumbered with a weak narrative that really let it down. Popstar's set-up is simpler and more effective and won't fail to make you laugh. It turns out Conner4Real used to be just Conner, a decent guy who formed a boy band with Owen and his other buddy Lawrence (Schaffer) just because he wanted to see what it was like to be famous. When he got a taste for fame, he became a monster: Owen became his Dj-slave and Lawrence retired to a farm to whittle woodcarvings but unfortunately he hates that job but anything to get away from the monster.The story, as Owen attempts to reunite The Style Boyz which was the name of Conner's boy band, hat bit is surprisingly engaging. What they have added to the film are the inspired cameos peppered throughout the film mainly from the worlds of music (Arcade Fire, Justin Timberlake, Seal) and comedy (Will Forte, Bill Hader oddly with very long hair), and finally both (Weird Al Yankovic). On a weird note there is also a penis, which if reports are to be believed, belongs to an A-list director. This is Spinal Tap, of course was pinned around several gloriously bad songs, but they were enjoyable much like this the music is stupid but it's enjoyable even if some of it is offensive. But This is Spinal Tap lampooned around different genres of music. And Lonely Island certainly know their stuff because they know their way around a big juicy hook, which is what a song needs as anyone who has watched their Saturday Night Live videos can attest. Highlights here include Finest Girl, a sex jam with relentless references to the assassination of Osama Bin Laden, and Equal Rights, a paean to gay marriage filled with assurances that the singer is heterosexual. The tunes in this movie are whip-smart, quick-witted and stupendously dumb but that's a good because the hook makes them catchy that you'll be singing the hits well after the credits roll.In conclusion this is a quick-witted and well written comedy that will make you laugh out loud and even produce tears from your eyes. This is certainly a Lonely Island movie and probably one of the best of their movies it's completely relentless even the greatest comedy kings and queens will love it.Verdict: An absolute blast, with a frenetic strike-rate and songs that will worm their way into your ears for days. Like Conner, this comedy's for real.8/10 incredibly funny",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Enough hilarious highlights in an otherwise okay movie,"The big question heading into ""Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping"" was whether The Lonely Island trio of Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone and Akiva Schaffer could make their brand of pop music humor work in a format that lasts longer than three minutes. Not surprisingly, it's in different three-minute clips that ""Popstar"" works best.""Popstar"" is a music mockumentary following a pretty standard faux biography structure: Conner4Real (Samberg) is a huge star who made it on his own after many of years of success as a member of the Nasty Boyz, a trio with his childhood best friends, Owen (Taccone) and Lawrence (Schaffer). The story predictably follows his rise and fall, narrating it with a host of cameos from actual music celebrities playing themselves as well as supporting characters.Conner is an over-the-top caricature of the dumbest celebrity you can imagine, and Lonely Island makes sure that there's no element of his music or rise to fame that you take seriously. Ripping into pop music culture, however, isn't the movie's focus. It's a film about a music group because its creators' gimmick is musical comedy. The goal, presumably, was to create outrageous characters and scenarios, not create stinging satire.""Popstar"" opts for the machine gun style of comedy, unloading jokes in rapid succession knowing that if at least a majority of them stick, they've done their job. Ostensibly, that strategy works. A number of gags land and feel like rather original jokes, too. From a wolf attack to a wardrobe malfunction to an argument in a limo that's besieged by naked body parts, the sequences constructed with the intention of being funny often are, it's the wedged-in jokes that aren't centerpieces that fall flat.Surprisingly, the comedy songs used in this movie aren't the highlights. Conner's single about equality in which the lyrics are all about how he's not gay even though he's singing about LGBTQ rights is pretty standard for Lonely Island. Fans of their music will be pleased, but the comedy really comes from the joke-writing and the occasional quick-witted dialogue exchanges.Nothing about the plot is surprising or particularly clever, however, and knowing exactly what direction they're going to take the story within the first 10 minutes weighs down the ceiling for what ""Popstar"" could be. If more jokes missed than hit, this flaw would be abundantly apparent and have caused the whole movie to collapse.The Lonely Island brand of cleverly packaged immature humor won't be a hit with everyone, but it definitely salvages ""Popstar,"" at least enough that I can highly recommend the clips.~Steven CThanks for reading!

"Good, but drags it's feet at times","Look, I love Andy Samberg. But, his comedy just didn't carry the movie far enough for it to be good. But, I will say this movie is good to just watch with friends and not pay much attention to. But sitting down to watch it is just eh.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Very offensive....very funny and perceptive.,"I am not in the target audience for ""Popstar"", as I am a guy in my 50s who has no interest in rap or anything written after about 1985. So, the fact that I enjoyed this is something...isn't it?!In many ways, this film is very much like ""Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story"" as well as ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby""....along with a heaping helping of pop music and rap. Just like Ricky Bobby, Conner (Andy Samberg) goes from the top of the game to total loser very quickly...and only by learning humility and appreciating his friends can he once again be on top. And, like ""Walk Hard"", it's a mockumentary about the music industry...and it's very crude at times and has some genitalia. It is NOT a film for kids, that's for sure!Overall, it's a clever an perceptive film...making fun of the stupid antics MANY modern musicians engage in as well as tickling your funny bone in the process. Enjoyable and worth seeing...provided you are an adult and have a relatively high threshold for the offensive.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Cameos, Cameos, Cameos!","I truly was expecting more out of this movie. Based on Andy Samberg's strong recent outputs in Brooklyn 99 his performance was a little light in this film. Although packed with cameos, it was a derivative and scripted. I do admit certain parts had me chuckling. The song parodies are still strong and a highlight of the movie, but the plot was easily discernible. I realize that heavy plot twists were not expected in an offering of this type, but a good story is still a good story and it lacked in this aspect. Any Lonely Island fans might enjoy the music and a few light guffaws. I still prefer Samberg in ""Hot Rod"" over this film.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Great movie if you love Lonely Island!,"If you understand Lonely Island you will love this movie. It may not be for everyone, however I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. If you don't know what Lonely Island is google them and watch them on youtube. This movie perfectly set the stage for a world were the lonely island crew had massive fans, but in reality their fanbase is rather small.Still the movie has massive laughs, the references are on point, and some of the songs are actually pretty good parodies of other genres.I give the movie a solid 9 out of 10. If I wasn't a Lonely Island fan I would still give it at least a solid 7. It's entertaining and fun, and a nice divergence from the Super Hero dominated world we have today.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Good for a laugh or two,"This is a good movie if you care for comedy music, I guess. It has its funny moments but a lot of it is also dull. It's not trying to be a great film, it's just going for laughs. Not all of the jokes land but a good amount do. It's not the funniest movie I've ever seen but it's definitely not not funny.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Different Comedy Experience,"The movie was set up with a familiar plot that shouldn't really blow anyone out of the water. it also had a unique reality TV type way of shooting the film, but this movie is really meant for one thing. The off the wall humor. However the problems with the film shouldn't discourage people who want laughs! The movie had quite a bit of off the wall humor. Although the movie doesn't have you busting your gut through the entire showing it has it's moments. So if you like The Lonely Island, or Andy Sandberg's humor, go see the movie! In addition I will say I found the music in the film quite entertaining. The ""So Humble"" song that's at the beginning of the movie and in the trailers is still stuck in my head, and I don't mind.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Just not that funny,"Comedy is very personal. That said I didn't find this laugh out loud funny at any point.I've enjoyed Brooklyn 9 9, the spoof videos of Andy Samberg, and Spinal Tap (which this is oft likened to). I saw a lot of similarities to All gone Pete Tong, but that was a much funnier film.This felt like it ticked all the boxes, but will probably be found funnier by a younger audience as condescending as that sounds. There just wasn't a great deal there, and what there was felt pretty forced/lame/cliche.Hell, give it a whirl. It wasn't terrible, but it could have been a lot lot better.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Very entertaining,"For a satire like this to work, it needs to have its heart in the right place. I was hesitant when watching the trailers, but fortunately the film doesn't lose track of the bigger humanization with these characters and it wears its heart on its sleeve. But perhaps that's also why it didn't go as far as it could have gone, and when all is said and done, perhaps plays things a little too safely. Still, it's vastly entertaining and the performances are aces. Andy Samberg excels at the comedy but also on making the lead a very likable protagonist, no mater his flaws. It's very easy to root for him. As a whole, definitely go seek this out and recommend it to your friends. Very underrated film that deserved to be bigger.",,Anonymous,Music
It's ok,"It's a comedy movie, so you're supposed to laugh a lot right? Well I giggled (not laughed) maybe two or three times in the entire movie... so I'd say it pretty much failed as a comedy movie. Nothing against Lonely Island and their novelty music, but it simply didn't make me laugh, and thus failed for what it set out to do/be.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Excellent Satire,"Great movie!! I absolutely love the way its a documentary with such famous musicians and rappers adding to the satire. The story is so true and attacks the song writing skills of today's music. If you have a good beat, throw in a bunch of catch phrases with a cool voice, add another famous singer to back up with a couple of lines and you got a new hip hop/rap song. I was completely entertained and recommend this movie for anyone to sit back and enjoy great comedy. Love the fact JT dominates the nerd entourage cook and has the ability to be humble and have fun with this movie. The swearing can be a little intense but the movie stays true to the creators. Hope everyone else enjoys as much as my laughter filled evening.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
The Vidiot Reviews...,"Popstar: Never Stop Never StoppingThe reason Canadian singers move to the States to work is because they're sick of being paid in bags of loonies.Mind you, the performer in this comedy is only parodying a Canuck crooner.When his latest album drops like a lead balloon, b-boy turned pompous pop star Conner4Real (Andy Samberg) is left reeling.Desperate to become relevant for his singing instead of embarrassing stage mishaps, Conner begrudgingly reconnects with the crew (Akiva Schaffer, Jorma Taccone) responsible for his early hits.But can the reunion withstand the constant call for Conner to remain solo?A rockumentary in every sense of the made-up word, Popstar's style, including endless celebrity interviews and raunchy road antics, lives up to its designation. But that doesn't mean that every joke in this hipster comedy works – in fact, very far from it.And as always, when an old band reunites, casinos across the country get excited.Yellow Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Great movie about a lovable idiot and his friends,"Let me start with this: the movie is NOT, nor was it ever intended to be an SLN skit. I've seen a lot of reviews around the net comparing it to their digital shorts, but it's a huge mistake and if you went to the cinema expecting an extended digital short, you have only yourself to blame for the disappointment. Another type of complaint is that it's not critical enough of the pop industry, but it's also a false expectation, it was never intended to do that. If you know The Lonely Island even a little bit, you have to know that they are true fans of the music industry in general and they don't drag people. Hell, Andy didn't do it when he was supposed to, just watch his roast of James Franco. He said he wasn't comfortable with insulting people and Akiva and Jorma share this sentiment. As Kiv said in an interview: they don't throw shade, they throw sunshine.So now that I cleared up that what this movie isn't, let's see what it is. It's a fake pop documentary about popstar Conner4Real, played by Andy Samberg. It's fake in the sense that obviously Conner is not a real person and the shenanigans he gets into are over the top TLI style, but other than that it's an actual documentary with famous people commenting on the events every so often. I don't want to spoil anything so I'm gonna be vague: the boys make fun of the ridiculous situations and circumstances that goes with being someone in the center of a lot of people's attention, they point out the absurdity in the popstar lifestyle, but that's only the comedy aspect of the movie. Underneath that, this movie is about a lovable, sometimes childishly oblivious and out of thouch with reality kinda guy, who never had a normal life, so he doesn't know how to deal with it when things don't go his way and we follow his journey to learn and grow as a person. Conner may be a fictional character, but he's not a caricature, neither is anyone else in the movie. The characters might be a bit over the top sometimes which provides the comedy elements in the movie, but the friendship between Conner (Andy), Owen (Jorma) and Lawrence (Akiva) is real and touching and THAT's what this movie is about. While obviously it's a comedy, there are a few real, emotional moments in there that made me tear up. I won't tell about the story more, but I have to mention the music briefly: the songs are amazing (though I'm not a big fan of Hunter's bits) and Conner performing ""Finest girl"" on stage is just hot damn!In conclusion: I really liked the movie, I think the boys have every right to be proud of it, and if you don't go into this with false expectations you'll enjoy it very much too! Mark my words: it's gonna be cult classic!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Not my flavour of comedy,"Hmm, I think I'm missing something here or I'm late to the party because I don't get it. I'm only familiar with The Lonely Island's viral music videos like ""I'm On A Boat"" to which I'm not really a fan of either. I know this comedy trio isn't a complete write-off though because people like Jimmy Fallon and the Saturday Night Live crew were behind them and they've been about since the mid-2000s. However, it really isn't my kind of comedy.It's a musical mockumentary which suddenly gave me flash-backs of David Brent but superbly involved music superstars like 50 Cent, Usher, DJ Khale, Naz and Ringo Star, either getting performances from Seal and Michael Bolton. P!nk, Akon, Adam Levine, Mariah Carey and even Simon Cowell, in fact there's so many it's quite impressive and hard to keep up.We follow Connor4Real (Andy Samberg) who has to come to terms with the looming fact he's no longer the brand name of the pretentious music industry. The film documents his split from the original line-up of The Style Boyz and his relationship with remaining member DJ Owen (Jorma Taccone) and fallout with ex-member Lawrence (Akiva Schaffer, who both direct this movie.)There's small parts galore which are borderline cameos excluding the musicians, Sarah Silverman, Joan Cusack, Maya Rudolph, Imogen Poots and even British Inbetweener James Buckley with the only other people worth mentioning is there manager Harry played by SNL regular Tim Meadows and Chris Redd who played the limelight stealing rapper, Hunter, echoing David Brent again.It's a total parody of the current pop music world and while it has some great satire it failed to make me laugh out loud and I don't remember anyone else in screening did either. It's dragged for a short 87mins runtime but what I was impressed with was the silly songs and the set pieces that were were spot on.I can only imagine fans of The Lonely Island will find this amusing I would recommend those to watch it and I'm interested to hear what they think. I can't knock their performances but for me, it was a waste of time and not something I would watch again. Just isn't my kind of comedy.Running Time: 1 The Cast: 6 Performance: 6 Direction: 6 Story: 5 Script: 5 Creativity: 7 Soundtrack: 7 Job Description: 0 The Extra Bonus Points: 043% 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Music
"A Little Formulaic, But Admittedly Funny.","Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping never looked all that appealing to me, but I must say it was surprisingly better than I expected. Seeing the trailers I thought the film was another in a wave of ultra dumb comedies, but up front, it's really not. Popstar is a little formulaic, but is admittedly funny, and finds a way to even be witty. Even more impressive, although not all that surprising is that some of the songs in this movie are actually pretty catchy, albeit mock-ups.For those who love This is Spinal Tap and other films of that nature, this film is a little derivative. That being said, it's not as if this is just a rehash of other better films, that entire genre does require modernizations every few years. Because this film is spoofing not only the musicians of today, but everybody in the entertainment world. That being said this film does list as another Judd Apatow film and does have some formulaic moments that appear in all of his films.The most notable ""Appatowism"" in this film is the overdone comedy trope of today, where the film lingers on jokes far longer than they should, under the illusion that lingering over a joke makes it funnier. It's kinda like when a goofy kid makes a great joke everybody laughs, and then the kid gets confident and keeps pushing the joke until everybody around is just wishing he'd shut up and go away. That being said, the film doesn't live off the annoying lingering joke, and succeeds at being genuinely funny, all the time. It's not the funniest movie this year, and it may not even be hilarious, but the film is consistently littered with raunchy funny jokes, that often deliver.The film was marketed poorly, in my opinion, because it came across as an ultra dumb comedy, and in reality isn't half as dumb as it comes across as. The film occasionally wanders into the dumb comedy area, but often finds it's way back into the land of witty comedies, making it somewhat of a mixed bag. For instance, the songs are catchy, they are witty reflections of our pop stars, but they are also a little too on the nose, making them come across as a little dumb. That being said, underneath the thin exterior of a dumb comedy is a really witty reflection of our current music industry, and the pressures, idiocracy, immaturity, selfishness, and chaos commonly associated with it.Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping is filled with cameos from famous musicians and comedy actors, some of which even lend their singing talents to the musical pieces. At times it feels like the entire music industry is in this film, as they play along on a mockumentary making fun of them. However, the film is never really mean spirited, or all that damning it just grooves along, spoofing everybody from the musicians to the fans. For those who like the lonely island, you'll love this movie, and for those who are seeking a funny comedy, regardless of rating this is also a movie you'll love, but there should be a note, this movie really isn't for kids or the weak spined.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
It's alright,"It's an okay film Andy Samberg and the rest of the Lonely Island are just so dam charming that this film was always going to have some semblance of quality. The sheer number of celebrity appearances is a testament to how well regarded the band is.There are a lot of points in the film where I feel they really rushed the jokes as the majority of them hit the mark, I feel they where trying to replicate Hot Rod in the sense that the film was cheap therefore the low brow jokes weren't out of place however with the amount of money that went into Pop star you kind of feel they could have written better. Plus the mockumentary style wasn't a good choice.My favorite cameo is Justin Timberlake, whenever I see him act it is always well aware of his roots as a musician and he perfectly sells every scene he is in.Watch with friends as you will have fun riffing of one another and enjoy the silly songs.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
I was expecting more,"When I started watching it I was hoping for something hilarious yet something that I could write more than few sentences about. Well, it wasn't that funny and it wasn't that smart either. The cleverest thing was how the main character Conner is exactly what we think certain kind of celebrities are like.I mostly wanted to watch this movie because I like The Lonely Island's music, and also Will Arnett was in it. Arnett's part was small, but I expected that. But there wasn't as much music as I would've hoped for. How many songs were fully played? Maybe four.Mockumentary as a style of story telling is getting a little boring, but how else would they have done this though?Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping was an okay movie.

A surprise hit in a unique genre,"While we've seen plenty of mockumentaries before it's not every year we see a new one. It's a genre that goes mostly unexplored, especially in mainstream cinema. From the trio of The Lonely Island (Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone, and Akiva Schaffer) we get Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping. Popstar follows Samberg's Conner4real, a Justin Bieber-like performer with A-list celebrity status, from his time with the boy band The Style Boyz to his solo career. On the verge of his negatively received new album and a world tour Conner must cope with the potential decline of his career and his celebrity status. The film works as a hilarious satire on the music industry while also being a parody of the concert tour documentaries we've come to see from various artists such as Katy Perry, One Direction, and The Jonas Brothers. Comedy veterans Sarah Silverman and Tim Meadows make supporting appearances and Chris Redd has fun with a potential breakout role as Hunter the Hungry, a fellow musician who's on the way up while Conner is on the way down. Not every joke in the movie hit, but the ones that did had me nearly falling out of my chair in laughter. The Lonely Island are known for their super catchy and occasionally raunchy songs and Popstar delivers in that department. So much so you'll likely have the songs stuck in your head in the following days. Popstar is an overall fun time at the theater. Also, be sure to be on the lookout for the plethora of celebrity cameos Popstar sprinkles within it's 87 minute run time.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping never really starts.,"This was always going to be divisive. A satirical look through the pop star telescope, where we have a fictional story filmed in the style of a documentary. Whether you view it as just a film or a slight dig at pop stars and bands like Justin Bieber or One Direction, it's undeniably entertaining. However, it's just that. It never really dives from the glossy surface to the depths of intelligence. A band entitled ""Style Boyz"" started off with a successful career, until the lead singer is thrown into the limelight and commences a solo career. We follow him on his new album release and tour and get an insight to the lavish lifestyle and pressure of a pop star. The key ingredient to this film is the inclusion of comedic band 'The Lonely Island'. Love them, hate them, don't care about them...but you cannot deny that their hilarious song writing is crazily infectious. I mean, I remember when they created a song called ""Jack Sparrow"" with Michael Bolton (who I'm glad is in this as well), and I still sing it to this day. In fact, I'm going to put it on right now. We've got songs about equal rights, terrorism and a great closing track. Clearly assimilating the current craze of having politically themed songs that aren't necessarily explicit. Throughly enjoyed the songs though. ""Keira Knightleyyy""! Performances were fine, with real cameos of musicians and media moguls embedded in the documentarian narrative. That's all well and good, the problem is...I didn't laugh. I smiled at a scene involving a swarm of bees, that's about it. For something that is supposed to be ""insanely funny"", I was rather underwhelmed. Clever but not hilarious. I also found the main plot to be ludicrously formulaic, which is a shame for a rather fresh idea. As soon as the pace kicked in, the film ended. Over far too soon. I can categorically say this was underwhelming, considering the mass adoration for this. However, it is enjoyable and would watch it again. Next time, have more Michael Bolton, he wins at life.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

don't forget to do the Donkey Roll!,"This is a silly gut-busting delight, the kind of movie that I'd see with my dad if I saw more movies with him - it's basically what I'd call ""Son of Spinal Tap"" and like when you got the ""Son of"" movies of old (Song of Kong, Son of Frankenstein, whatever) it's not up to par with that, but then that's among the funniest comedies of all time. The ""Lonely Island"" team may take on some targets who are almost so obscenely ridiculous in real life - ie Justin Bieber's comments after leaving the Anne Frank house - but they have an excellent instinct for taking on these targets in the pop music world of today, which is just about unlistenable in many respects, and throwing on the silliness and vulgarity but the vulgarity works because it's from a place that's not really mean.The main character of Samberg's, ""Connor 4-Real"", is one of those lovable self-obsessed idiots of the movies who works because he is so unaware of how dickish he acts to people around him. There are times where the improv approach as it's an Apatow production by the way goes on a bit too long, mostly in the second half of the movie (the first half fires on all cylinders and largely in part due to the songs and music videos with themes like ""I'm so Humble"" and f***ing a woman as if it was killing Bin Laden!) But on the whole I found a lot of really sharp actors around Samberg - Tim Meadows, Sarah Silverman, Justin Timberlake, and many other 'real' people (and a helluva running cameo from Will Arnett, the highlight of the movie for me as a ""CMZ"" chief editor ala TMZ) - that makes it consistently funny.And it's the kind of dopey modern satire I like if it has to be done this way at a big studio level: keep the gags and jokes coming, even if they involve penises (and this movie has one of the better ones), and if there's a gag that falls flat there's one in a minute that will keep the pace back up, whether it has to do with ""10 seconds to Mars"" (it's a band, not a fact) or unexpected celebrities like Seal and the Rza. Call it a semi-guilty pleasure but I had a lot of laughs here, and more than some other SNL movies I can think of.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Not quite as bad as I was expecting, far from anything great","So, again, I had zero expectations to enjoy this movie. I expected 87 minutes of dragging, over-the-top stupid humor, and ultimately a burning desire to see credits rolling, but to my pleasant surprise, I actually did not hate this movie. Now pump the brakes... I did not love it. It is not my underrated comedy of the year, it simply was better than I expected. When you see Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer, and Jorma Taccone tagged to a film, you should already expect 'Saturday Night Live' satire and humor. 'Popstar: NSNS' simply was an SNL skit expanded to a feature film length, much like its previous successors when popular SNL skits were turned into films. The satire of the pop music world was clever and hilarious at moments and it definitely had those moments that made me laugh at how much the film tore apart notable pop stars in the music world. Now that is the extent of the positives for this flick. Once the film reaches its climax, it loses its steam and quickly becomes a snooze- fest. The comedy quickly reaches too far to pull laughter from its audiences, meanwhile I was already out the door.Again, not a total failure as I was anticipating it to be. It had its fair share of moments where it vultured a laugh or two out of me and the ever susceptible topic of pop culture and its superstars were ripe for the picking to create clever and relentless jokes of which I enjoyed. But nonetheless, it was a 50/50 movie with a teetering edge in the positive direction due to the satire comedy.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Popstar is 4real,"Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping is written, directed and starring ""The Lonely Island"" trio, Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone and Akiva Schaffer. ""Popstar"" centres around a former boy band member and his struggles after the commercial failure of a record. So just by the way I described that, you're probably thinking, ""Huh... Sounds like a melodramatic film about an egotistical celebrity figuring out his place in the world"" and well guys I have to tell you, ""Popstar"" is one of the funniest satirical films I've seen in years. Initially I was hesitate about this film but also had high hopes due to this being a ""Lonely Island"" film and I've loved their material in the past from SNL, to their music and films, such as ""Hot Rod"". My hesitation stemmed from the lack of jokes hitting in the trailer so it had me pretty nervous but I tried to relax as I realized I am in the hands of 3 gentlemen who can really nail comedy and boy they did in this film. I'll try to describe this film as much as possible without spoiling anything as everything you see in the trailer is practically in the first 20 minutes of the movie. Now what made this film so great was like I said, the satirical play they did on a celebrity's life, it took situations and scandals thats happened to some famous actors, musicians, etc and runs with them trying to make it as wild as possible. One thing that really elevated this movie and I loved, was how authentic this film felt, it practically rips the Justin Bieber documentaries apart, all while including many celebrities talking about Conner4real and how he changed the face of music. You really buy into this film due to that and how serious each celebrity cameo plays their part, that it makes you feel like you're actually watching a real life documentary on a living and breathing artist. Like I said this film contains many celebrity cameos, so many that I won't even name because I feel like I would be ruining it. Now this movie isn't all good, as with most comedy, some jokes didn't land but luckily when a joke fell flat they didn't stick around too long as this is a very fast paced film clocking in at an 87 minute long run time, also when the jokes hit they sure do hit with side splitting laughter. Another problem is its story, when you get past the cleverness of the joke writing, the core of this story is very cookie cutter and a little too basic, but then again this is a comedy and I shouldn't be expecting anything revolutionary from its story, all I care about is if it can make me laugh. This is definitely a social commentary on the way we view and treat celebrates today, heck this universe even has its own version of ""TMZ"" which is hysterical. There is so much social commentary that by the end, you kind of sit back and reflect, so I really have to commend this film for being deeper than it needed to be. At the end of the day this really was just another goofy comedy but what it did with its creative writing and satire, it made it better than it ever needed to be and for that reason, ""Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping"" gets an 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
This movie is dope,"""Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping"" is a satirical comedy film that takes a hilarious and over-the-top look at the music industry through the eyes of fictional pop star Conner4Real, played by Andy Samberg. The movie follows Conner as he navigates the highs and lows of fame, from his rise to stardom as part of a boy band to his struggles as a solo artist trying to stay relevant.The film is raunchy, irreverent, and filled with absurd humor, poking fun at various aspects of celebrity culture, the music industry, and the nature of fame itself. Through its exaggerated characters and outrageous scenarios, ""Popstar"" offers a sharp commentary on the pressures and absurdities of the entertainment world, while delivering plenty of laughs along the way.While the movie may not offer deep insights or profound commentary, it succeeds in its goal of providing pure entertainment and escapism. The catchy songs, celebrity cameos, and comedic performances keep the audience engaged and amused throughout the film, making it a fun and enjoyable watch for those looking for a lighthearted comedy that doesn't take itself too seriously.Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping is a wild and witty satire of the music industry that invites viewers to sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride.

Style Boyz for life!,"'Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping (2016)' is an absurdist satire of popular music artists that mostly nails its mockumentary aesthetic. It feels like something that would surprise drop on a streaming service, despite obviously being an outlandish comedy that's every bit as absurd as you may expect something from The Lonely Island to be. For instance, there's a gag in which Bill Hader's guitar manager is introduced and then given a backstory in which his hobby is to flatline like in the movie 'Flatliners (1990)'; it's bafflingly random, surprisingly funny and never mentioned again. There are several moments like this, but the movie has a solid throughline and most of its jokes serve its surprisingly cohesive story. It's not groundbreaking or anything, but the narrative actually does what it ought to. The characters have generic but appreciated arcs and the loose plot is surprisingly satisfying overall. The main reason to watch, though, is the fact that it's genuinely funny on more than one occasion. Even when a joke doesn't provoke a laugh, it usually works on some level; this is the sort of film you smile all the way through. With a slew of charismatic cameos from both comedians and real music artists alike, the affair keeps you on your toes throughout and often catches you off guard, causing you to laugh at the sheer unexpectedness of a particular moment. It's a good time from beginning to end.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Seal Stole The Show!,"My personal objective of seeing the best 100+ films of each year is quite a daunting & laborious obsessession. However, discovering films such as Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping makes it absolutely worth the while. This mockumentary that exagerrates the quirks of the popstar life, is absolutely HILARIOUS and is a shoe in as one of the best comedies of 2016.The comedic success of Popstar is rooted from its parody of a popstar's celebrity status, made outrageous to the nth degree. Its themes then relishes on idiocy and unfiltered, sometimes raunchy comedy, perfectly suited for its cast that features Andy Samberg & Chris Redd. From the brainless & offensive songs, to the ridiculuous on-stage & publicity stunts, the films gimmicks are original, hysterical & impressive in their embellishments. Also, the enthusiastic supporting cast of famous comics & artists adds to the fun, as their limited screen times steal the show.With jokes that are unafraid to be dumb, silly, and gross in all the right ways, Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping is comedy gold. It is constantly
laughable, with well executed cameos to boot. Sure, the riches to rags storyarch is easily predictable from the get go, but with tear-jerking laugh out loud

Popstar is not a good movie,"Popstar is just another method by which Hollywood controls the people. Stupid, vulgar, unoriginal, incredibly immature (oh how we instill terrible values in our youth!), lowly, mean spirited, and rarely, if ever funny. Even the content that garnered a reaction from me seemed to do so unintentionally. The copious amounts of positive reviews on here make me wonder if IMDb manifests its own conspiracy...Underlying the ""comedic"" subsistence of the film is a message: the pop music industry is built upon formula, not talent, not originality, NOT the genuine desire to guide the people's consciousness-- or moral compass-- toward higher mentalities. Unfortunately, ""The Lonely Boys"" follows the same formula, in effect overshadowing some enlightened realizations with yet more unenlightened ones.No good. Don't believe the positive reviews unless you're an impressionable, susceptible 12 year-old. In which case, don't watch the movie at all!",2.0,Anonymous,Music
Reliably Funny,"One of the things I loved to do when I was a kid was hook up my old camcorder to the TV and face them towards each other. The effect would create a swirl of constantly moving frames that would eat into each other like reflections on either side of a fun house mirror. Popstar is kind of like doing that. It points the camera at fictional pop superstar Conner (Samberg) but it might as well be pointing it directly at the music industry, creating a post- modernist spiral of superficiality that is at once hilarious and distressing.Taking cues from modern music vanity projects (though from Justin Bieber: Never Say Never (2011) especially), Popstar follows music icon Conner as he prepares for a world tour and awaits the reception of his newest album. Conner was formerly a member of The Style Boyz a Beastie Boys inspired trio co-developed by Lawrence ""Kid Brain"" Dunn (Schaffer) and Owen ""Kid Contact"" Bouchard. These days he's dubbed himself Conner4Real and replaced the embittered Lawrence with a constant stream of social media updates. Owen is still around though he's been relegated to the status of iPod shuffling DJ on Conner's world tour.Popstar is arguably one of the most savagely entertaining music industry satire to come out in the last few years. While constantly focused on the low-hanging fruit of celebrity personal branding, product-placement, reality TV inspired banality and faux savoir- faire worldliness, audiences can't help but respond with heaps of constant laughter. The laughter becomes louder when The Lonely Island crew cuts deep into Hollywood's insincere sanctimony and egoism such as when Conner releases ""Same Love"" inspired ""Equal Rights"" which reiterates Conner heterosexuality one too many times.The film is littered with an obscene amount of musical celebrity cameos ranging from Danger Mouse, and RZA to Michael Bolton and Weird Al Yankovic many of which play themselves and give sit down commentary on how their music was inspired by Conner's ""superior"" abilities. This in itself is a funny premise but the movie takes it to the nth degree allowing celebrities to savagely mock themselves and each other with the absurdity of A$AP Rocky hawking school lunchables. Let's face it, any movie that begins with holographic versions of Adam Levine dry humping himself while Conner sings ""I'm so humble"" in the background is clearly setting a mocking tone.That said there are some jokes that just don't work, the most egregious of which is Popstar's parody of TMZ, CMZ. The set-piece hopes to coax laughter out of sycophantic shrieking and Will Arnett's need to always have a straw in his mouth. This along with tour sponsorship being handled by washing machine manufacturer Aquaspin are more bizarre than funny.Yet with the sheer amount of visual humor, clever dialogue, goofy- comic setups and a richly layered meta-text, you can't help but enjoy a movie so crudely and gleefully nutty (in more ways than one). The musical interludes are boat loads of fun; Lonely Island's ""Finest Girl (Bin Laden Song)"" being the real showstopper. Andy Sandberg, Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone are clearly at the top of their game and with any luck, still have a few more witty tunes to churn out in the future.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
10 minute sketch stretched to 80 minutes... but I enjoyed it,"Considering how much I like the comedian Andy Samberg, it's kind of surprising that I've mostly seen him in smaller trivial movie roles and ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine"", but not ""SNL"" which is his main body of work on screen.So the catching up may begin with ""Popstar"" which gives him a big movie role. In a rather little known and commercially flopped movie but still!Co-written with ""SNL"" buddies Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Tacco, all three forming a rapping boy band. The most successful one goes solo later and this is mostly his story about going places, then falling down and rediscovering the charms of having your true buddies with you, always.The result is mockumentary-style modern music business fable, hitting on all the main clichés and having a surprising amount of real life stars cameoing, mostly as themselves commenting on the main character's career. More on that later.Like many projects by famous American screen comedians, ""Popstar"" has some good ideas and ambition but doesn't really reach out to any refreshing new ground, relying mostly on the charms of the cast and their ability to improvise.They try quite hard and steadily, to lampoon the American new pop music industry – where mediocrity rules and promotion is way more important than the product – but end up mostly imitating or rehashing the stuff they are supposed to laugh at.So if you like Samberg, you will be at least somewhat amused by the result; if you don't know or care about him you can quite safely miss this movie.Judd Apatow is credited as one of the producers. His ""extended family"" has actually produced similar lampooning comedies in the first half of 2000's. Some of them are actually good and still watch-worthy: ""Anchorman"" (about 1970's TV news business) ""Walk Hard"" (about music business) and ""Talladega Nights"" (about NASCAR racing). So if you don't dislike Will Ferrell or John C. Reilly or Apatow school of modern rude but sweet comedy, you should check them out.Just to let you know: ""Popstar"" really has amazing amout of real life stars in small roles, playing themselves mostly.Including Questlove, Carrie Underwood, NAS, Usher, 50 Cent, Ringo Starr of The Beatles, Simon Cowell, Adam Levine (Maroon 5), Akon, Mariah Carey (insisting she's the most humble person she knows), Pink, radio host Big Boy, DJ Khaled, A$AP Rocky, RZA, T.I., Pharell Williams, Seal, Snoop Dogg, Weird Al Yankovic, Michael Bolton, The Roots, Katy Perry, Justin Timberlake, Danger Mouse, Jimmy Fallon, Arcade Fire. Also popping in are some cool comedy people like Sarah Silverman, Will Arnett, and Bill Hader.Yes, it's a good 10-minute sketch stretched to over 80 minutes... but I still quite enjoyed it.

"It's funny, cleverly mocking the pop culture and predictable","We got lucky to see the advanced screening of Popstar. It is a very straightforward and predictable story. But that is intentionally so, taking a dig at the pop movies. It parodies every aspect of pop media, the TMZ, the paparazzi, the entourage, the egos, the commercialization etc.The cleverness and comedy is not in the story. It is in the telling of it. It is what happens along the way. It is one of the funniest movies you'll see the whole year. The acting by the Lonely Island group is spot on with their comedic timing. The whole ""The Office"" themed documentary style also bodes well with the theme. And at last the music. The whole idea behind the movie, according to Andy Samberg, was to 'showcase the music they created, so they made a movie around it'. Now I won't go as far as to say that the music will win Emmy's but it sure was catchy and funny! It is a one time watch movies that will not disappoint.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Incredibly spot on satire,"If you like the previous songs and videos of the ""Lonely Island"" than you will love this film, if you didn't, than you might want to spend your money on something else. This movie was a brilliant on the nose satire of the way of life being lived by a lot of the stars that cameo in this very movie. The jokes walk a fine line between being stupid (but still funny) and clever wit disguised with a ""stupid joke"" coating. All in all it was a good movie, one of the best new comedies I've seen in a while, and I would definitely recommend it. It can be difficult to create a comedy movie because it's hard to keep a joke going for an hour, Popstar does a great job of this task.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Hilarious although crude... Too many celebrities,"It's no Hot Rod, one of the most underrated skit movie comedies of all time in my opinion but this does a pretty good job if you don't want to use your brain. The crudeness (nudity) is pretty funny but of course with the shock it's a bit cheap. Also an unnecessary and stood weed scene... But hey there's a lot of money there to push it to the kids...The film brings in the music of Lonely Island which is a plus, even though like their actual music only half the songs are funny and only half the songs are good.. but they can be very good and very funny and there are a couple of absolutely hilarious tracks.Also the celebrity cameos. I know it's a documentary style which often has celebrity friends, but it mostly doesn't work ( Mariah Carey and SJ Khaled excepted) and seems more like a Samberg popularity flex. Social media and Trump has shown that celebrities are lame and only have political beliefs to further their popularity and keep their corporate overlords happy. Happy to see less and less of them.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A brilliant satire - this generations This Is Spinal Tap,"In 2007 a small-scale comedy with little hype and eventual disappointing box office returns and reviews appeared on our cinema screens, that film was Hot Rod.Featuring the trio of comedians that would eventually become a popular singing group known as Lonely Island, Hot Rod introduced Andy Samberg, Jorma Tacone and Akiva Schaffer to the world and while initially it seemed like the gangs feature film foray may've been a mistake, in the years to come Hot Rod has become one of the great cult films of recent memory and a beloved comedy staple that continues to be enjoyed today.On the back of Hot Rod's eventual success and the heights they've reached with Lonely Island, it's a shame that many cinema-goers failed to jump on board with Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping as what we have here is a mockumentary look at modern day music and fame that could very well be our modern day take of This is Spinal Tap.It's a big call, and one that is perhaps overly optimistic but Popstar with its clever mix of industry lampooning, cast of colourful characters, downright hilarious faux songs and high percentage of joke success (even though the often immature and low common denominator humour will absolutely not be for everyone) certainly stands as one of recent memories best mainstream comedy films and a further win for the Lonely Island collective.Recruiting a star studded ensemble that features cameos from a huge collection of stars both from the movie industry and music scene, led by Samberg as the self-absorbed Connor, the film offers the trope a great playground to deliver their large swag of jokes that are on consideration a lot deeper than you'd gather at first glance and with a near endless stream of content coming at the viewer, as was the case with Hot Rod and key to its lasting success, Popstar is a comedy that will likely continue to find wins on repeat viewings thanks to the various hidden jokes and references that may take keen eyed viewers a while to fully discover.In a genre that has largely been floundering of recent years, Popstar against all the odds stands as an against all the odds shining robot headed beacon of the mainstream Hollywood comedy factory and a likely new favourite to many that will discover the film on home formats, just as Hot Rod did when Rod Kimble found his audience at home after an initial lacklustre reception.4 sick turtles out of 5",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Twizard Rating: 93,"You'd think the mockumentary genre was played out by now. If you asked me before I watched this movie, I'd probably think so too. But the humor that the boys of the Lonely Island have concocted is not only completely fresh and well thought-out, but will prove to be ahead of its time some day.One-third of the comedy team, Andy Samberg, stars as Connor4Real--a Justin Bieber-esque pop icon--who's former hip-hop group broke up when he decided to start his solo career. Experiencing the downward slope of his fame and his slow decline to ""has-been"" status, his ego is too big to realize or admit it.Along the way, we get documentary-style interviews from real-life ""contemporaries""--such as Usher and Mariah Carey--who give commentary on Connor's career.The movie is filled with at least a half-dozen songs, which are all catchy enough to be on the radio. But upon further attentiveness to the lyrics, they're laden with totally crude and offensive- -yet hilarious--content.So many jokes are completely off-kilter and have no ounce of necessity, but we're glad they happen. The humor, both subtle and broad, showcases the comedy trio's range. They use the Seth MacFarlane rapid-fire approach, but in a way where the jokes are much more uniform and cohesive. And if one doesn't work--or merely goes over the audience's head--there's another right around the corner to make us laugh and forget about it.It finds a nice balance between antics and story. But the Lonely Island have made their brand by successfully fusing political incorrectness, awkwardness and silliness. And the trio has taken it to the next level here. They have such a tight grasp on not only what's funny, but what's topical and realistic--making everything that happens in this movie feel like it could actually happen--or is actually happening. It's a great feeling to completely trust your filmmakers.The movie is directed by, and featuring, the other two members of the Lonely Island, Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone. Together, with Samberg, the three of them have established such perfect chemistry over the years, that they probably don't care if you're not laughing at all because it's obvious they believe in their work and make themselves laugh, all while having a great time doing so.The humor may seem very easy to think up, but is in fact, pretty inventive. Some jokes may prove to be a bit more esoteric for those not in the industry, but there are plenty that aren't.Usually a lack of laughter comes from something not being funny. But there's an ode of confidence exuding from this film that you feel like, if you're not laughing, you just don't get the joke.Ever so slyly, the movie's main theme is a mockery of the self-absorption and self-aggrandizing of today's media and society--especially within the millennial generation. But it's never preachy. In fact, for those most caught up with what's hip, the jokes may not come of as jokes at all.Samberg has so much conviction in his role. It seems as if he truly believes every naive thing that he says and does. His character is so over-the-top, but Samberg makes him so real that it's never over-exaggerated.While a tad predictable, that's not the point. Popstar never tries to be any other film. So many times have we seen American comedies give their best shot at shamefully replicating--or reinventing--a Judd Apatow/Adam McKay/Todd Phillips/Seth Rogen style of comedy, and lose their own vision. But these guys take their own vision and have their way with it. Samberg and the Lonely Island have influenced comedy a lot in the past decade or so. And now they're changing the rules all over again.Twizard Rating: 93",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Spinal Tap for the You-Tube Generation,"The Lonely Island (Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone, Jorma Taccone) take their song-writing and music video talents to the next level with this brilliant send-up of pop music and the changing music industry in the internet age. It is not that Christopher Guest is too subtle or Weird Al is too old-fashioned; but with declining attention spans and deluge of digital entertainment options... they are.Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping is able to capture and imbue the same deadpan satire with in- your-face subtlety. The best satires are a reflection of the current state of culture, music, technology, fandom, and yes vulgarities of society. So while some may dismiss ""Popstar"" as another 90 minute crude-as-craft Apatow vehicle, peppered with cameos to re-grab the attention of the AD/HD crowd, it is much more than that.In 2005, The Lonely Island viral video ""Lazy Sunday"" was the tipping point for the now ubiquitous You-Tube, and is credited by some for its subsequent $1.5 billion valuation and acquisition by Google. The ensuing battles over copyright take-downs, creation of Hulu, and IP ownership was not lost on it's members. The immediacy and vulgarity of Samberg/Apatow's trademark humor are layered over the archetypical music parody plot, which is simple, superficial hilarity.But for those looking closely are themes of privacy vs. social media, corporate overreach, obsession with celebrity news, the absurdity of today's ""music""... all with back-handed whimsy. Managing to mock their own audience without them even realizing they are also being critiqued. While Samberg is the lead, the other members co-star and direct, with all three credited as the writers. The Lonely Island boys know how to goose the Millennial audience to remain relevant, while servicing their own influences (namely Christopher Guest and Weird Al Yankovic).And therein lies the real fun of this film. You can choose which level you want to enjoy it on. Deadpan satire? Sure. Social commentary? Definitely. Mindless fun with crude humor, poking fun at pampered, self-important pop-stars (possibly from Canada)? Absolutely. Oh, and it also reminds you that friends are good.

Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping (2016),"Directed by Akiva Schaffer & Jorma Taccone. Starring Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone, Akiva Schaffer, Tim Meadows, Sarah Silverman, Chris Redd, Imogen Poots, Maya Rudolph, Joan Cusack. (R)The ""This Is Spinal Tap"" rock mockumentary style is updated to the modern age when dance pop and hip-hop dominate the charts; Samberg plays Connor4Real, an industry superstar dealing with the fallout of the release of his heavily-hyped album to dismal reviews and sales. Raucous, fast-paced comedy throws everything it can at the dartboard and sees what sticks, be it incisive satire, sly insider jabs, deadpan one-liners, knowingly dumb gags, or gross-out vulgarity. As a result, sloppy at times and uneven overall, but it's admirably relentless and generates more than enough laughs (even the shameful kind) to ultimately succeed in style. Serving as actors, producers, writers and directors, it's Samberg, Taccone and Schaffer's show--they of Lonely Island fame--but they share the wealth with their co-stars, including a galaxy of celebrity cameos from both the film and music industries, often playing themselves. As it is with Lonely Island, the songs are often ridiculous but still catchy enough to get stuck in the head (notably ""Finest Girl (Bin Laden Song)"").72/100",7.0,Anonymous,Music

watch it for yourself but its 90 Min's you will never get back,I will get straight to the point I am a fan of Lonely Island and all genres of movies but this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. Not one bit funny. Cheesy jokes and very cringe worthy. Not as bad as Meet The Spartans(as worst movie of all time) but nearly on par. I am easily pleased when hungover with comedies but this made my life hell watching this. This is my 2nd review only after Meet The Spartans which came out 8 years ago. I don't like to complain but I am passionate about how I feel about this shocker. I will watch this movie again as I did for Meet The Spartans to give it a second chance. Everyone deserves a second chance right but I am expecting the same outcome for Meet The Spartans.,1.0,Anonymous,Music
"Great Soundtrack, Funny Movie","This movie is pretty good. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing and is loaded with very catchy songs. Most of the songs don't really make sense but that's kind of the point throughout the entire movie. The songs are also filled with a lot of irony, specifically ""Humble"" where he's humble-bragging throughout the entire track. Some of the scenes and jokes are absolutely hilarious. I would have rated this movie a bit higher but there were a lot of jokes that felt forced or flat to me. It was definitely hit or miss from scene to scene but there were a few moments I needed to pause the movie because I was laughing so hard. 3.5/5 stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Funny and forgettable.,"Popstar: Never Stop Never StoppingDirected by Lonely Island's own Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone, Popstar is a faux-documentary comedy about the rise, fall of Conner4Real. Originally apart of a boy band, Conner4Real leaves his group to go solo only to get full of himself, similar to other real life pop stars. The film pokes fun at real pop stars throughout the film.Conner4Real is played by SNL and Lonely Island's Andy Samberg. He plays the silly, ignorant and sometimes stupid pop star. There was no real acting done since Andy was playing himself. I didn't like That's My Boy, or Hot Rod, and the only film I liked him in was I Love You, Man where he played a small but memorable role.Jorma Taccone plays Owen, Conner4Real's best friend and one third of Styleboyz which is their boy band. The other third is Lawrence the last of the Lonely Island, Akiva Schaffer. Owen is the friend that never left, where Lawrence plays the one who left. This adds a bit of conflict for a film that really is just a conglomerate of music videos.The problem with the film is that I had already seen many of the funny moments on YouTube. I know a majority of movie-goers don't follow the Lonely Island and it shows in the box-office. I counted three times the film made me laugh, but I imagine if I had not seen the publicity and went in blind I might have laughed more.Verdict: I can't say don't see the film. It is going to offend an older audience, 100%. It's funny, and that's what a comedy is supposed to do. For that I recommend watching it.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Great spoof movie,Obviously if you don't like goofy movies you're not going to like it. But it you love the lonely island this movie is a 10. I loved it. It's a laugh out loud funny movie if you like their style of jokes. I'd watch it again.Makes fun of a lot of people inside and out of the music industry. Most of the new songs in the movie fit very well as it pertains to following a story-line. An R rated happy go lucky movie. If you want to leave the movie theater with a smile on your face rather than disappointment of the world's tragedies I can't suggest this movie more. It's a 10/10 for me. Average audience I'd say a strong 7/10. No stupid over used Seth Rogen jokes in this movie. Thank the LORD!!!,10.0,Anonymous,Music
Pretty silly and fun,"The scene in the new comedy POPSTAR: NEVER STOP NEVER STOPPING that made me laugh the most was when the out of touch POPSTAR played by Andy Samberg autographs a penis. If this set up sounds like something you might get a chuckle out of, keep reading. If not, you may go back to whatever else you were doing.Okay...that should have gotten rid of the contingent that this is movie is NOT for. For the rest of you degenerates, I would highly recommend POPSTAR: NEVER STOP NEVER STOPPING as a laugh out load jokefest that skewers just about everything in modern POPSTAR-ism.Andy Samberg stars as white rapper Superstar Connor who is living off the enormous popularity of his first solo album. When his 2nd album tanks, Connor tries everything in his power to stay on top. And those things are pretty silly, crude, funny, grotesque, inappropriate, foul...you get the point. If that type of humor appeals to you (and it does to me), then you'll enjoy this.Samberg co-wrote this film with his THE LONELY ISLAND compatriots Jorma Taccone (who co-stars) and Akiva Schaffer (who co-stars and directs). These 3 grew up on Saturday Night Live and this film has the feel of a variety of sketches tied together, fairly successfully, into a film. Samberg brings the right amount of cluelessness, selfishness and charm to the role of Connor which gives us a character that we can root for and against. He is ably assisted by co-stars Schaffer and Taccone as well as a litany of comedy and musical guest stars - mostly in cameos. The likes of Maya Rudolph, Bill Hader, Sarah Silverman, Tim Meadows, Joan Cusack, Will Arnett and Kevin Nealon all join in on the fun as well as musical stalwarts Carrie Underwood, Usher, 50 Cent, Ringo Starr, Adam Levine and Mariah Carey, to name just a few. They all come on the screen with great energy and play along just right.Is it a ""classic"" comedy? Well...no. But it's a pretty good one that gave me enough laughs - including the penis joke belly laugh - that enables me to strongly recommend this film. If you're looking for a 90 minute escape, then you will be well rewarded by POPSTAR, it's well worth seeing.7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Hilarity From Beginning to End,","Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping is a terrific movie with a very well developed plot and a top notch comedic cast. If you are a fan of the Lonely Islands, then this movie is not to be missed, and it is exactly what you would expect from the trio's first feature length project. It is a laugh riot from start to finish as we follow Connor separating from his group Style Boyz, trying to make it as a solo artist. What follows is a consistently funny, always energetic and never tedious ninety minutes that is a pure delight. There are many great songs featured throughout, which we have come to expect from the group, they really went above and beyond for this project.I was a little underwhelmed, I was very excited for this film, and was hoping it would be a nine for pure comedy gold, but it ended up being an eight for me. I really just felt that the plot could have gone further, I would like to have seen Connor in more ludicrous situations before making peace with his best friends. I felt the screenplay really had the potential to go anywhere, but it played a little safe.The cast is phenomenal. Of course, Andy Samberg is stellar as Connor 4Real, a snobby, arrogant, lovable artist that the versatile comedian nails. As well as that, Jorma Taccone, Akiva Schaffer, Sarah Silverman and Tim Meadows shine in main roles, while there are also a ton of priceless cameos throughout that I will not spoil, but each one is well casted and simply hilarious.Ridiculous fun from beginning to end. Stellar cast, comedically brilliant and boasting some excellent original songs, I would highly recommend Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping to anyone looking for a good comedy.A member of boy band Style Boyz tries to make it as a solo artist, however, it proves difficult to break away from what originally made his famous.Best Performance: Andy Samberg",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Is it constantly laugh out loud funny? No. Is it worth a watch? Yes,"You have to go into this movie knowing it's satire. There are so many reviews interpreting this as a serious movie, and it is not. Basically, this is a ""mockumentary"" sort of movie about the fictional character Connor and his solo act ""Connor4Real"". The mockumentary format can be a bit offputting to some, so keep that in mind. I got used to it pretty fast, though. Most of the jokes were met with that slight ""heh"" and exhale you do when something is funny, but not funny enough to warrant an actual laugh at. There were a few scenes where everyone in the theater lost it, though.This plays out like a long SNL/Lonely Island sketch, and for some people that is good, and others it is bad. If you enjoy the Lonely Island's previous work, you'll most likely enjoy this. Check out their official Youtube channel; they've posted some clips from the movie if you want to see the kind of comedy in it.If you have some time to spare, go see this movie. If you have to make time to see it, I would wait until it is released on DVD or streaming. My reaction to it is an ""Eh, it was good"".",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Andy Samberg made this?!,"Andy Samberg is a funny guy. I've always enjoyed his Lonely Island videos on Saturday Night Live and I like the fact that he gets outrageous and over the top. This movie is absolutely terrible, and I really looked forward to seeing it. It's not funny in the least, it's incredibly pedestrian, and very, very dull.What was he thinking when he made this? The humor is like something out of a network sitcom and the script is dated and totally predictable. It clearly had a huge budget, and there are cameos from a lot of pop stars, and every single one of them is wasted. I think I laughed only one time in the film, and it was during a satire of TMZ.Don't waste your time or your money on this. Twenty minutes into the film I realized it wasn't going to go anywhere and I found myself getting more and more impatient for it to be over. I finally gave up and walked out after an hour, which is something I rarely ever do.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
"A bit formulaic, and miss-marketed, but fun","Popstar may be a bit overstuffed at times, but it is able to remain consistently entertaining throughout and at times quite funny. Andy Samberg leads a brilliantly over-the-top performance as Conner-4-real and truly carries the film on its comedic level. Tim Meadows and Sarah Silverman also provide some great supporting performances, as well as Joan Cusack as Conner's mom. The film can be a bit formulaic at times, as previous tropes are poked fun at, as they have been before, and at times the film can seem to be scraping the bottom of the barrel for some original moments (besides the songs). The film can be quite funny at times, with some lovely and clever satire, as well as some truly stupid, but fun moments and hilarious cameos. In the end, Popstar is not a total success, but it is able to carry itself more often than not, and prove to be a showcase of talent from all involved- especially The Lonely Island themselves.

Decent Critique of Pop Music,"While this movie is not as great a satire as ""This Is Spinal Tap"", it take a look of deserving jabs of the pop music scene. When people want an example of why I hate the popular music scene, I will give this as an example.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Cute comedy,"This silly, guest-star-laden comedy follows a former boy-band star turned solo star turned failing solo star. Andy Samberg plays the self- involved, narcissistic star as he lets a big head eat away at his career.The song parodies are wonderfully accurate parodies of banal, pretentious pop music, and there are some very funny scenes, particularly one involving wolves.But the movie always feels rather slight. Samberg's character has little depth, so his fall from grace feels less like the tragedy of hubris and more like a jerk getting his comeuppance, which means you never really care about the story. It's a very jokey, superficial film, so when it's funny you enjoy it but every time the humor weakens you think, why was I watching this again.While not as funny as Samberg's series, Brooklyn Nine-nine, it's definitely fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping,"Fans of Andy Samberg's film Hot Rod have waited a long time to see something that matched the humor and feel of that classic comedy. The Lonely Island has brought its unique brand of comedy to the small screen with SNL skits, and Popstar is a classic return to the big screen. While bizarre and goofy, it was filled with funny moments, especially to those who have seen all the music videos of The Lonely Island. With many references to previous skits, it will be enjoyable for fans of the show, but I could see how those unfamiliar with The Lonely Island will find the movie somewhat dumb and lacking in humor. I found Popstar fairly funny throughout, with a few laugh out loud moments. I will admit the story line was stretched and ridiculous, but it was never meant to be taken too seriously to begin with. I would probably see this again, and would recommend it to those who are familiar with Andy Samberg and Company's previous works.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

"Clever, funny and fun","I wasn't quite sure what to expect going into 'Popstar: Never Stop Stopping'. When it comes to Andy Samberg I find his music very funny, but his comedy styling and acting are not so much to my taste. So I was pleasantly surprised to find myself having a very good time with this film. Right from the start it was genuinely funny and the music was catchy and hilarious in only the style that 'The Lonely Island' can achieve.There are an enormous amount of celebrity cameos, all of which are cleverly done and seem like the person really bought into it. The story, while a playoff of Justin Bieber obviously, is actually really investing and well structured.When it comes to comedy I find it's almost always a case of simply asking yourself, how funny was it? In the case of 'Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping' though it feels like there were more layers to it than that. You can appreciate the music, the story and the send up of Bieber. I don't think this did overly well at the box office (was it marketed very well? I never heard about it until well after it was released) which is a shame. I would recommend giving this one a look.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Awful music genre to me so not a movie I enjoyed.,"Although I like almost every comedian in this movie and also a couple of the ""real"" music stars that are featuring in Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping I'm disappointed. I thought it would be better to be honest, but the music is so bad it's cringing to listen to. I know it's supposed to be funny, and there are a couple of funny scenes, but the choice of music is really painful to listen to. I guess this movie must have cost a lot when you see all those ""stars"" featuring but that doesn't mean quality. The story is boring, and the fact I love Andy Samberg normally, certainly as Peralta in Brooklyn Nine-Nine, doesn't change anything to me. He's always funny in what he does, but in this case the music didn't help. Maybe I would have liked it more if it was another genre of music, but this kind of music is the one I hate in real life so watching a long movie about it didn't help.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Exactly what you imagined when you picture a feature-length SNL Digital Short,"I love ""The Lonely Island"". I am a huge fan of their music and I think they brought something fresh and original to the stale format of SNL. I highly enjoy the antics of Andy Samberg no matter in what format, and I think that a lot of the time their humor is intelligent, satirical and highly tongue-in-cheek.But, as in the case of some of their shorts, songs and highly reminiscent of a Seth Macfarlane sketch, whenever there is spare time in the script they overuse their jokes and run them way too long.Now imagine a Digital Short at feature-length. For every genius moment that was thoroughly enjoyable (the amazing last number ft. Bolton and Usher and the singing fish, the Mona Lisa and Ben-Ladin songs, the wedding scene...so much when you break it down) there were another two that were all fizzle.I wish there was a minimalist editor's cut of this film where an outside editor would be able to trim all the fat and leave us with the good solid meaty substance that is definitely present... But seeing as there is no such thing, I cannot help but render Pop-Star a one-time watch with re-watches of clips on Youtube. Sad.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"A fun film, but also very sensible.","The title clearly says it is a parody of 'Justin Bieber: Never Say Never'. I haven't seen that, but this film was so fun. Just like another 'Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story'. If you like the combination of music and comedy, this is for you. I think the writing was the best thing, even the lyrics of the songs. The directors did their part very well, but in the end it was the actors who saved the film. Andy Samberg was splendid.The film was narrated in a documentary style like a series of interviews which also includes behind scenes, I mean unedited clips like the live recording. It is the story of three members of a famous band in America. When everything was going well for them, the split happens unexpectedly. So the main singer decides to go solo and sees some success. But he struggles through his girlfriend and their marriage plans, and also he finds some issue with his manager. You know the makeover begins, how he comes back to his normal life was the remaining film.It is not anybody's biography, but you should still watch it. The storytelling is not preoccupied with the drugs and sexes, though there are some amounts, which makes it is good viewing for the adults. Don't think it is some silly comedy, lots of things from it makes sense. You can enjoy the music and at a time you would have some laughs.

His elaborate stage performances are a big highlight, spinning the band's notoriously loony lyrics (the ""Bin Laden Song"" production must be seen) into a heavily-funded, bombastic concert experience that's pitch-perfect. Lampooning the inherent idolatry of pop music is like shooting fish in a barrel, so it's intrinsically shallow fun, but the laughs are pretty consistent.

A Solid Coming-of-Age Story Disguised as a Satire,"Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping is a parody of the modern music industry, and it follows a young pop star, Conner4Real, as he reaches fame and suddenly begins to plummet.For starters, Andy Samberg is really good as Conner4Real. He captures the self-centered obliviousness of the character without making him feel too fake or over-the-top. He's a super fun character, and it's clear that Samberg is enjoying him too. Jorma Taccone stands out as a particularly good performance as well, as the sidekick friend character who kind of awkwardly lives in the background.The comedic aspect is great. The main source of this is in the songs that Conner4Real performs. They're all great. They sound generic, but the lyrics both fit the character who wrote them and prove to be hilariously offensive. And even the comedy outside of that is great. Again, Samberg really has a good time with this one, and the writing for him proves to be just the same.And yet, despite the comedic and satirical aspect of the film, it is still at least partially a coming-of-age story. Samberg's character really isn't that unbelievable, and when he starts to fall it takes on a more serious tone. It's not a weird sudden tonal change because the movie is both serious and comedic all the way through, it just gets more serious towards the end. In some ways it is kind of generic as far as coming-of-age stories go, but the characters are solid enough to carry it, so it wasn't a problem.Overall I really enjoyed Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping. It's a solid comedy and an equally good coming-of-age story. In the end I would definitely recommend this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

A decent pop satire that plays like a 45,"This mockumentary of the glossy pop world has popped up on many ""best of streaming"" lists over the years. So it's always been on my radar despite the fact that I'm a long way from being a teenager listening to the latest rap masterpiece.Luckily my age, tastes and gender proved irrelevant to my enjoyment of ""Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping"" as its takedown of mediocrity, hype and personality supersedes the context. Frankly there's a lot of low hanging fruit here with the central character being a walking, talking stereotype of someone who's found success too fast and too young. But that fruit is sweet.What I particularly like about the movie is that it is fundamentally about money and how that changes everything. When a golden goose is born everyone around the goose tries to keep it as happy as possible, pandering to every stupid wish, just to make sure that the goose keeps laying. But maybe that's not much good for the goose?That said this is no ""Spinal Tap"". It's more light-hearted and perhaps the excesses it's portraying aren't as destructively hedonistic as those in the rock world. Here it's more about being spoilt and unreflective and less about drug overdoses and groupies. Which is no bad thing - sometimes you need the light rather than the dark.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A lot of fun,"Amusing mockumentary in the vein of Spinal Tap. Andy Sandberg stars as vapid pop star Conner, who came to popularity through a hip-hop group he founded with his two best friends (the other two members of Lonely Island and the directors of the film, Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone) but who has recently gone solo. Taccone has stayed on as his DJ, but he mostly just plays music through his iPod at concerts. Schaffer was infuriated with Conner's behavior and has gone rustic and become a farmer. The film is very silly and a lot of fun, with plenty of great gags, hilarious songs, and entertaining cameos. I do think it runs out of steam as it nears the end - it has to wrap up the plot and becomes semi-serious, and it kind of harms the momentum.

But Connor abandons the band to form a solo career and is forced to see his celebrity status crash after the project fails.The film was put down to its short running time, inappropriate remedies and a story lacking in any real substance which saw the film bomb in the Box Office, making just over £9 million from its £20 million budget. Maybe it's my immaturity, but I think the movie is a stroke of comedic genius, it features big names such as 'Ringo Star' and 'P!no' who are caught up in this world of Conner4real. The songs are fuelled with obscenities and stupidity with purpose; the ideas in the concept and the script are transferred to screen perfectly, we as viewers are not meant to take the film seriously, it is an event, a performance, one for us to laugh at and enjoy.It's a unique picture, with interviews and songs, the acting isn't at the forefront of the piece, it is humour in abundance, some say overload, others think it is 'what it says on the tin'. The film's title is an explicit indication into what to expect with the watch Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping is an exaggerated long-winded name acting as a trope of the real life group that is The Lonely Island, the music isn't even that bad, but it's lyrics and on-stage performances are what provide the jokes.

May have been too smart for demographic,"To paraphrase the old cliché, pop music in the digital age is never about about the music, man. ""Popstar"" rips into an admirably broad set of pop music conventions and events including, hysterically, U2's force-feeding of its album to Apple users, awareness - raising songs about popular topics as a way to boost cred and sales and, most notably, the pervasiveness of music-by-committee. As the spot- on named ""Connor4real"" says: ""it takes a village to make me look dope."" As that quote suggests the writing lampoons modern hipster vernacular as well as it does modern entertainment dynamics. Beyond the opposite of tone deaf writing and subject matter, the film delivers more Easter eggs than the famed Bunny. This may partially help explain why it was only lukewarmly received. There's so much insider baseball, somewhat obscure references, meaningful cameos and stuntcasting it may have just overwhelmed the 12 to 24 demo that largely came to see it. Also this reliance on such of-the-moment comedy fodder may mean the movie won't age or travel well. In short, best to see it soon before everyone forgets the Bieber / Anne Frank incident (remember that? well, Justin was...).",7.0,Anonymous,Music

I think Andy also is an underrated actor and jim carrey should be the model he chooses to follow as far as a career path. But I think Pete Davidson may have thought that and ironically he is now caught in the same vortex of andy where after snl -- look for more raunchy comedies.,7.0,Anonymous,Music
"The Lonely Island get a funny movie out of Popstar: Never Stop Never Stoping, even if the joke runs out too soon","The best movies about show business are usually done as mockumentaries. Somehow, the style feels more real when ironically, nothing about the characters are real themselves. A lot of it comes down that the people making the mockumentary probably understand the most about troubles and tribulation on what goes on behind the curtain. They know that the biggest stars are the craziest people around. They've figured out how unforgiving that show business world can be. They especially know how hard life can still be with the fame (or without it). Though there are plenty of regular feature films that have parodied the show business world fine enough, the mockumentary style somehow makes it look more unsentimental.At the top of my head, the best movies about entertainment are A Hard Days Night This is Spinal Tap, and the lesser-known Waiting for Guffman. All three portray the world of show biz with some really funny characters (or in the case of the Beatles, exaggerated versions of themselves), and a relatable story on the hardship of trying to make it and how they manage to continue onward. Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping is a modern day look at the music industry.The mockumentary is a look at the fictional band Style Boys and their frontman Conner Friel (played by Andy Samberg). Conner is a musical prodigy and has always counted on his friends to support his dreams. After years of working together and making a mark on the charts, they break up when one of the members Lawrence (played by Akiva Schaffer) is not given credit for a song nor is even thanked when Conner wins an award for it. His other friend Owen (played by Jorma Taccone) stays on and moves into the background as Conner's DJ, while Conner reinvents himself as a Justin Bieber-like singer called ""Conner4Real"".His first album Thriller, Also is a hit and advances him to massive stardom. His ego (and low intelligence) pushes him to make reckless choices and surrounds himself with yes-men who only encourage more bad ideas. His second album Connquest is met with critical bashing and a bad publicity stunt that causes massive blackouts (I can't tell why, it's too funny). He attempts to continue a world tour with opening act rapper Hunter the Hungry starting to gain more popularity then it's main star. The movie is filled with interviews from real life icons like Simon Cowell, User, Carrie Underwood, Seal, Pink, Arcade Fire, and even Ringo star.When you really get down to it, Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping is a film version of Andy Samberg's parody band Lonely Island. Though comedic, Lonely Island has generated real hits, real concerts, and has even been nominated for an academy award. Andy Samberg clearly understands the world he comes from, as he makes some sharp criticism about the music industry. All the songs featured here are very funny, catchy, and oddly sound like something that I would hear on the radio.What Samberg also understands is how guys like him could make it in the world. Though obviously exaggerated, I can't help but think that some real life musicians are as naive as Conner is here.As funny as the joke is, I'll admit that it does start to run out of steam sooner then it should. Though running short at an hour and twenty minutes, it still felt way longer then it should be. Perhaps if we saw some more fake musicians that Conner is up against, we might have seen some justification to go on longer. Though this will probably play well on the digital market, it barely makes it as a movie.I'll give this seven Lonely Island albums out of ten. The joke is funny, even if it's not as substantial as it wants to be. Most music fans and those that have liked Andy Samberg will probably enjoy this parody. I'd say give the Lonely Island music a listen too first and them maybe check this movie out.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"""Not Gay""","Scenes in this movie had me laughing harder than I've laughed in a long time. Other scenes fell way short. In its entirety, it is worth it to wade through some jokes that missed the mark to enjoy some spot on satire and comedic excellence.The parts that shine in the movie are the songs. Not Gay had me rolling. The portrayal of how pop culture latches itself onto the social issues of the day, regardless of personal beliefs is hilariously accurate.Samberg shows an amazing ability to be a self-absorbed prick and yet somehow still likable.Too often comedies will sacrifice the laughs to try and draw up a meaningful conclusion to the story, but this movie accomplishes both without sacrificing either.Surprisingly enjoyable. 8/10",7.0,Anonymous,Music

I like how Connor and a few others are basically yes men that just go along with anything even if it's a fail or outrageous. A hype movie that you'd think would bomb yet has plenty of appreciation.

I'm not a fan of Samberg but I have to admit I really enjoyed this and this was much better than I expected.,"""Ever since I was born, I was dope."" Conner (Samberg) was part of the biggest boy band in history. After the break up he decides to begin his solo career. After some success he is excited to release his new album. When it is released tomixed reviews.he tries everything he can to remain on top, but things don't go as he planned. This is a movie I had very low expectations for. I am not a big Andy Samberg fan and really only liked when he did the songs on SNL, that said I did laugh and liked this a lot more than I expected to. This is essentially a mock-umentary about a Justin Bieber type guy who is so disconnected from reality that it leads to hilarious outcomes. The songs in this are great, my favorite was the one about gay marriage. For someone that is not a fan of Samberg at all I have to admit I really enjoyed this and even though it started to drag and get repetitive this was still much better than I expected. Overall, somewhat of a fake documentary based on the guys that do the SNL songs, much better than I expected. I give this a B.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Reviews are all over the place,"...but in our house..the score was a solid 10 from all of us.What is puzzling to me...if you are not a Samberg fan, nor a fan of Lonely Island, why in the world would you go see this, and then score it low?There are dozens of choices out there; movies are $10+. Why, if you either don't like their humor or, worse yet, don't ""get"" their humor, why would you spend your money?For those of us who are fans (and some who didn't really know what to expect) the movie was nothing short of brilliant Pitch perfect in most spots; laugh out loud funny in the rest. Just really well done.The cameos are a hoot, the plot is serviceable, but the star is the music. Those Lonely Island songs are hysterical.Oh - and the helmet worn by Jorma as Samberg's DJ should get a billing of its own.I am puzzled by posts from people who question that ""30 seconds to Mars"" joke. If you honestly don't get that joke (and believe it was in the trailer) then please, save your money. If you didn't think that was funny (or you didn't get it) I'll just say, kindly, don't go. This is not for you.And for those who are whining about it being filthy and disgusting - - oh my gosh, it's Samberg and it's rated R.

It's Good for a Few Laughs but POPSTAR Hasn't Got a Lot of Substance,"It was only a matter of time before the Lonely Island guys came out with a music mockumentary; I just expected it to be about Lonely Island. Nope. Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone, and Akiva Schaffer instead bring us into the world of fictional international pop icon Conner4real (Samberg). The movie is constructed as a behind-the-scenes/concert film for Conner as he prepares to release the follow-up album to his massive hit solo debut. Conner was originally a member of boy band/hip-hop trio the Style Boyz but broke off on his own when his ego became too much to handle for the trio's writer, Lawrence (Schaffer). Now Conner tours the world with the band's third member, Owen (Taccone), as his DJ while Lawrence has retired to a quiet life of farming and subpar wood carving. Conner's second album debuts with such controversial hits as ""Equal Rights"" and ""Bin Laden"" and becomes an instant flop. Unable to cope with failure and surrounded by useless sycophants, Conner life begins a downward spiral and Owen believes a Style Boyz reunion would be the best thing for everyone. Unfortunately, Conner and Lawrence didn't exactly part on the best of terms and getting the two of them in a room to talk, much less reunite for a performance, is going to be near impossible. POPSTAR: NEVER STOP NEVER STOPPING is an improv- laden mockumentary in the same vein of THIS IS SPINAL TAP but never achieves its level of awesomeness, but it has got its share of laughs.I enjoyed POPSTAR for what it is but watching it has made me realize how much I miss normal scripted comedies. Improv films can be real hit-or-miss and this one is no different, but I'd say the scales tip in favor of the funnier bits. There aren't a whole lot of hilarious moments that'll be with you too long after the movie is over, but you're bound to get some chuckles from it if this is your type of comedy. Personally, my favorite gag comes about halfway through the movie when Conner's manager Harry (Tim Meadows, excellent as usual) is breaking some bad news to the singer over some breakfast mimosas and Conner has a rough moment, asking the documentarians to kill the cameras for a minute. The video cuts out but we keep the audio as their tender conversation quickly turns when a wandering bee becomes a nuisance and quickly escalates to a battle of life and death. That was probably the one time the movie got a solid laugh from me. The rest is a bit of a mixed bag but fans of Samberg and the Lonely Island material from ""Saturday Night Live"" shouldn't be disappointed. There are plenty of new songs created for the movie and Conner4real and some of them are pretty good, but there's nothing on the level of ""J*zz in My Pants"", ""I'm on a Boat"", or ""Motherlover"". This is why I was hoping it'd be a mockumentary about Lonely Island: great music catalog.Since it's a ""documentary"", it's filled with cameos from music artists who've got a sense of humor and contributed interview snippets including RZA, Mariah Carey, and Ringo Starr. You can also expect the usual cavalcade of comedic talent filling out the rest of the case, such as the aforementioned Tim Meadows as Conner's manager and Sarah Silverman as his press agent. There is plenty of talent on display here; Samberg and company pulled out all the stops to surround him with high quality cast-mates. So even if the comedy isn't your style, you can spend the duration of the movie tracking the endless stream of cameos. Otherwise, it's exactly what you would expect for a Lonely Island mockumentary. If that's your thing, you'll probably find a reason to watch and I'm sure you'll enjoy it fine. If not, this movie isn't likely going to win you over. POPSTAR is what it is and to me it's a fun piece of throwaway entertainment that might've aspired to SPINAL TAP levels and fell short. The Apatow style of improv that's permeated comedies in the last ten years is good for a quick laugh but most of the movies of this sort are quickly forgotten and I'm sure POPSTAR, as amusing as it can be, will probably fall into that category.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
They can't make comedies anymore.,"I don't know what it is but I call it the Family Guy and Ricky Gervais effect. People try to act and sound like the Family Guy characters or in the UK like Ricky Gervais. It is a kind of way they speak, they keep a joke going on too long and add words that don't need to be there for comedy affect. They talk over each other because they think it looks 'more authentic' as in the way real people speak. Pitch Perfect 2 being a perfect example of this. Comedy now is just a cringe fest. It is not funny at all. If you look at comedies pre 2008 they are some great really funny, well done classic comedies.I wish that Family Guy had never happened because it has single handedly destroyed comedy, even The Simpsons try to copy it and it is the worst, most un-funniest show that has ever been on TV.",1.0,Anonymous,Music

A Popping' Good Spoof,"Negative reviews understandable if pop and/or music film performers evoke (hooked) some adoration, even idolatry, from ""fandom"". This film is a straightforward parody (spoofing) of the commercialization & selling of a star to a wide-eyed gullible audience. From writing (and selling) dumb lyrics; a shallow persona; an attending entourage (Conner4Real - yes, that's our star's stage name) possesses amongst his 30+ personal attendants someone to watch over his pet turtle. Most ludicrous was his hook up with an appliance manufacturer, Aquaspin, to have his songs play when you open the dishwasher (etc.) door. Again spoofing how we buy into anything the ""worshipped"" attach their names to. The TMZ (called CMZ here), celebrity gossip scene spoofs were spot on. Finally, were all the film's 10 second celebrity guest spots giving commentary on our show star's sorry state of affairs as his career rises and falls and maybe rises again - watch and see. These guests spots included as follows: Underwood, NAS, 50 Cent, Ringo, Levine, Carey, RZA, Seal, Fallon, and more.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

"Definitely more hit, than miss.","'POP STAR: NEVER STOP NEVER STOPPING': Four Stars (Out of Five)A pop music spoof, starring Andy Samberg. Samberg plays a former boy band member, that will try anything to remain popular. The film was directed by Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone (who also costar in the movie), and it was written by Samberg, Schaffer and Taccone (the three also worked together on'Saturday NIGHT LIVE'). The movie also costars Tim Meadows, Sarah Silverman, Chris Redd and Imogen Poots. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, but it still bombed at the Box Office. I really enjoyed it.Conner4Real (Samberg) is a world-famous pop-rap recording artist. He used to be a member of the popular boy band The Style Boyz, and the group had a horrible falling-out. Most of Conner's fans really want the band to get back together though. When Conner's second solo album bombs, Conner becomes desperate to regain his popularity. He refuses to make amends with his old group though.The film plays out like a spoof of Justin Bieber documentaries (or similar movies). I've never seen any of those films, so I can't give a comparison, but I think this movie is hilarious (mostly). It's definitely more hit, than miss. Conner4Real is too unlikable a character though, so I didn't really want him to succeed. Even so, Samberg is great in the role; and the ending is pretty satisfying (to me). So I mostly liked the film, because it is really funny.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/BdhMQkH1n2k",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Blah,"I can certainly see why this was a failure at the box office. It's not very good and more importantly, it's not very funny, though it is not without a chuckle now and then, but that's about it. I like Andy Samberg and he has proven he can act and be very funny, but his character is so obnoxious here it is hard to care much about him. By the time he shows a nicer side, it's too late to care and it's also predictable as hell. The idea of a boy band singer breaking out on his own is a good one, if the writing is wittier than what's offered here. There is an onslaught of cameos mostly from the music world in this. Some are very game, such a Seal in particular, but most fly by too fast to make much of an impression. I did like Jorma Taccone as another in the boy band who sticks with the Samberg character despite increasingly poor treatment. Much of this is pretty stupid and it is vulgar as sin and I'm no angel, but it's hard to believe that a group this offensive could make it as big as presented here. I don't think the dumb title helped with the box office either.",4.0,Anonymous,Music

"Pop, Lock, and Jab At Hollywood. Popstar is Clever, but a Bit Over The Top","You see them on E network. You read about them in the popular tabloids. The life of a star is on display for everyone in this world and we eat it up like pies in a fair contest. Heavy are the heads of those who wear the crowns of stardom and many will do anything to keep the light on them. This weekend, Samberg and his crew release a movie that attempts to poke fun at the silliness that is music artist drama. My review is on Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping. Let's get startedThe GOOD:  Clever presentation.  Lots of jabs at Hollywood trends  Lonely Island Songs Filling The AirThe first thing I loved about Popstar was it's clever presentation in the form of a documentary, or in this case a mockumentary. Popstar is a tale about Conner, a former pop sensation who is trying to go solo in an attempt to keep his fame high. To help promote the album, the arrogant, naïve boob hires a crew to capture his life on tape to portray to the masses (the audience). In this format, we didn't just get to see Conner's screw-ups, but observe the thoughts of those involved in his entourage. Various celebrity cameos riddle the interview scenes, making hilarious comments that show the fickleness of the Hollywood scene. This dual approach kept things interesting, and provide a variety of comedy styles that shows some people still have originality.Popstar's plot also allows for opportunities to jab at Hollywood stars, who enjoy a few too many benefits due to their status. I can't tell you how many times I smiled when they threw a celebrity under the bus, or parodied an incident that some dopey star has done in the past. You know that what is being done is stupid, and Samberg's overacted antics only make it more ridiculous. But it's satisfying to hear someone bash a celebrity for acting so juvenile. While I can't say they hit everyone, Samberg and company cast a wide net to cover a lot of musical entertainment follies while also extending into the obsessions of the general public. Yesyou the audience also get to be jibed as they emphasize just how absurd fans can be about everything and hurtful they can be thanks to the Internet. And what better to way to poke fun then a Lonely Island musical number in all itsinteresting qualities. The vulgarity and aggressive nature of their songs remains just as colorful as their albums.THE BAD: Offensiveness  Banter gets old  Overacted at partsDespite how much fun the movie is though, someone is sure to take offense to some of this movie's more assertive jokes. The opening number about Not Being Gay is sure to rile up some community's twitter account that will black ball Samberg. I agree that there are some moments that cross the line, but audience members need to put their big people pants on and realize most of this is a joke, or don't see the film. Still Samberg and his crew need to watch where they travel to in terms of their comedy, especially when it further stains the image of America to foreign countries.As I mentioned earlier, the comedy is very diverse and spans a number of styles that keep it fresh. One of those happens to be the banter routine, where Conner and some poor schmuck get caught in a rousing game of idiot tennis. Much like the T.V. shows that plague cable these days, Popstar has plenty of these moments, where the characters go round and round on an issue. Some of these arguments are pretty good, especially with the writing. However, there are other times where these banters are annoying, or a bit too stupid to be enjoyable, (which happened around the third or fourth time), as they rant on and on (much like this review). This was especially true in the TMZ parodies, which was a farce that needed to be two minutes and dropped like a scalding cup of coffee.And much like the banter, sometimes the acting itself goes too far into the overacting territory. One certainly sees the SNL roots at times, particularly in Samberg's moments of overemotional whining or screaming. Some may like this silly style of acting, but when it is drawn outwell that's when I lose interest. Even the supporting actors trail in this territory, but fortunately the writing bails them out and we move on with the film. There are even a few stunts that didn't fit well into the movie, depriving the more emotional parts by hamming it up with a cheesy interlude. Fortunately, much of these weaker parts are short-lived and the low running time only further helps.The VERDICTI was pleased with this movie and for the most part found it entertaining compared to half the comedic crap that comes out of the woodwork. Popstar's creative presentation and diverse comedy style will surely bring a little something for everyone. Sure there are moments that things get out of hand, and there are lots of moments I wish were cut out or edited down to say the least (especially more mature male organ parts). However, Popstar indeed stands out and certainly deserves a chance for those wanting a laugh. Worth a trip to the theater? Heck no, it lacks pretty much everything I praise for a movie. But I encourage a rental when you get the chance.My Scores:Comedy/Music: 8.0Movie Overall: 6.0",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Real Talk,"Members of Lonely Island got their big break at SNL. Andy Samberg in front of the camera while Jorma Taccone & Akiva Schaffer made cameo spots and wrote for the show. There they launched those funny digital shorts which in turn lead to a musical career doing highly popular pop / rap parodies complete with great music videos. Then came 2016's 'Popstar'.Presented as a mockumentary, it follows guys Conner (Samberg), Owen (Taccone) and Lawrence (Schaffer) who form the Style Boyz and find success in the music industry. Its when Conner features on a hot track he gets a boost in stock, but won't admit that Lawrence actually wrote his verse. The Style Boys split and Conner goes onto a successful solo career as Conner4Real. Of course you see where this is going. The rise and fall of his career, mistakes made, money, ego, fakeness, etc.A lot of the reviews here are from fans and/or bandwagoners. This pic failed for a reason.

Musician Seal gets the best of it involving wolves. You want brilliant satire? Watch / listen to 'I'm On A Boat' for the fiftieth time instead.

The Longest Lonely Island Music Video,"Spinning out from the success of The Lonely Island and SNL, Andy Sandburg, Skiva Schaffer, and Jorma Taccone began to try their hand at filmmaking. After their hit comedy, Hot Rod, the trio reunited for their second feature film, crafting a musical comedy reminiscent of their real-world boyband. Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping, utilizes the satirical parody music of The Lonely Island, but pairs it with a mockumentary filming style to capture the over-the-top madness of stardom.Leaving his boyband behind, Connor4Real embarks on a mockumentary journey of his new solo career, while unknowingly attempting to cope with his friend group break-up. Through his journey of stardom, Connor consistently makes mistakes and accidentally causes misfortune for himself and those around him. While the right choice stares him in the face throughout the film, he has to discover his inner peace before he can be the man he wants to be. With not much else to the story, a never-ending list of cameos attempts to make up for the slower parts of the film.Though predictable in its story of highs and lows, the film succeeds with its parody music, poking fun at pop culture and 'tacky' thoughtless songs that somehow rise to fame. The writing trio does what they do best by creating truly humorous songs, that work on their own as well as in the narrative of the story. As the basis for The Lonely Island, the comedic hip-hop makes for the funniest and most clever moments of the film. While the story is forgettable, Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping is memorable for some of its catchy songs, which stick in your brain long after the credits role.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Criminally Underrated!,"I didn't expect much, nor hear much, of the film when it was released in theatres. I watched it a few years back and it instantly became on of my favourite comedies.

Pretty much every song in the film is catchy, hilarious and can get stuck in your head for days. I wasn't expecting giving it a 10/10 but when thinking of a score, I couldn't think of a single thing that made me want to give it a lower one. I love this movie and wish it got the recognition it deserves for how funny it is!",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Peak Lonely Island,"The entire film is like one big amazing Lonely Island song - the greatest one they ever did. It never stops being funny. It actually hurts, how brilliant this film is.

"If you're into this humor, then watch immediately","If you're into spoofs, satires and mockumentaries that are funny as he*#, then it's time you threw on Pop Star: Never Stop Never Stopping. Anyone I've texted about this movie has replied with the same answer of, ""It looked so stupid."" But, that my friends, is why this movie is so smart. It mocks real life events in the music industry, pop culture, celebrity culture, the news and so much more. It's perfect.Just like Naked Gun, Airplane, and Scary Movie, Pop Star is the perfect mix of satire, realism and just flat out comedy. Of course it's dumb. So are humans and the real world we exist in. That's why it works so well.The best (my favorite) stand-up comics are always the ones commenting on the real world and how they fit into it. Andy Samberg knows how to create a character that seems completely absurd, but in reality, isn't that far off from reality at all. It's amazing to see and this movie is laugh out loud, cry tears type funny. Embrace it and let the good times roll.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Simply Classic,"After watching Dave Chappelle's the Closer about a week ago, I decided to randomly watched this again. I try to make my reviews for people like me. Maybe, your the rare person who likes and dislikes the same things as me and that's always nice. Hopefully, I'll help you find a few gems as I review more things. So anyways, I hated The Closer and I just can't watch this movie without laughing so hard I have to catch myself so my neighbors won't complain. It's just my type of humor. I still listen to the songs: "" Incredible Thoughts"" ""I'm so Humble"". I just don't know what else to say but that this is one of my favorite movies and one of my most underrated movies. I'm not going to say people "" just don't get it"" or this or that. I know this is not a movie for everyone but for me, this is a pure classic. Remember, ""Be good to each other, peace"".",10.0,Anonymous,Music

The Lonely Island Are Back!,"If you are/were a fan of The Lonely Island then you're going to love this. This movie has all 3 of the original members, and they're all great, the songs are back this time even more crazy. Andy Samberg is a comedy genius, especially when it comes to working with The Lonely Island, this movie was amazing a must watch of Sambergs if you ask me.The humour is fantastic, the chemistry is spot on and the story, it has a mockumentary feel to it and it works in the best way possible. Such an underrated movie i wouldn't change any of it, superb job for everyone involved.I'd highly recommend this movie to everyone, not only TLI fans, I think this movie would make anyone laugh no matter what you like.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Comedy for acquired taste,"Popstar Never Stop Popping appeared to be a parody of many artists and popstars mockumentary style concert type films in music. This film shows a very realistic view point of how artists go through fame and shows the ups and downs of the music industry. The budget as relatively low but they made the film very much watchable and unique with all the cameos and extra stunts. One can tell they did their research and Adam Sanberg put a lot of effort into the making of the film. Having doubts of how exactly the film would, Never Stop Popping exceeded my expectations and was a lot better than expected. The film is quite short which works well in its favor as it does not overstay its welcome (meaning it doesn't drag on). The parodying of TMZ was another unique and funny aspect of the film. This film flopped which is a shame but nonetheless not surprising. Recommended for those who enjoy Lonely Island or are seeking a concert type comedy. As a rewatch 08/05/18' Popstar feels better and moves more smoothly on a second watch. Highly recommend as this film is quite overlooked but then again is for an acquired taste in comedy and music of sorts. Enjoy and don't take the film too serious. Further rewatch 04/29/24' great watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Funny all the way through.,"Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping is a musical mockumentary directed by Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone. The film stars Andy Samberg on the lead role as the popstar and co-stars Sarah Silverman, Tim Meadows, Imogen Poots, Joan Cusack and Maya Rudolph. This movie is basically a satire of the celebrity life (Justin Bieber much ?) and the way that famous people react to falling from grace among other things. I personally really liked this film, it was incredibly funny all the way through and Andy Samberg does a fantastic job on the role here. He's actually really funny and we're once again reminded of his talent. The soundtrack is also unbelievably amazing, all the songs have a really catchy beat and funny lyrics that just replay on your head for a long time after hearing them. It does drag on for quite a bit unfortunately even though it is only 86 minutes it felt like much longer. Also the movie is filled with clichés but I guess that is not the point of the film because it was never trying to shy away from them or be something ground breaking. It is just a fun flick to watch when you have free time and I appreciate it for that.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

A Smart Mocumentary.,"Review:
'Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping' is an American mockumentary-comedy film directed by Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone. I can't even count how many times I have watched this movie and it never gets old. I watch it for reasons any normal person would watch a movie, entertainment alone. However, I watched it more closely this time around because I wanted to give an impartial review, based on the movie's criteria and not what my own personal sense of humor is.
The film follows a solo music artist by the name of Conner4Real (Andy Samberg) as he falls from fame and reconnects with his childhood friends.
This movie was so smart taking the documentary route, because the three guys from ""The Lonely Island"" are not the best actors in the world. Taking this approach, they didn't need to be - it felt like a crew was just following these people around and weird shit was happening. They have so many cameos in this movie too. I'm not going to say who because some of the people they got is so surprising, again almost all the cameos are playing themselves and can't really act, so this format works on all aspects.
Everything in this movie is to the moon and it's fantastic. The soundtrack is incredible and funny. They got so many guest artists to feature in this soundtrack, such as Akon, P!nk, Emma Stone and Linkin' Park to name a few! It's something that is going to be offensive to some, if you take it the wrong way. You really need to go into this knowing who ""The Lonely Island"" are and what type of comedy they possess versus what their views are in real life. They look at comedy as making fun of political views, so when we watch the music video for ""Equal Rights"" and Conner is being very offensive in the video starting throughout that he is ""not gay"", it's Andy Samberg making fun of 'Toxic Masculinity'.
Overall, if you're a fan of ""The Lonely Island"" you should check this one out, because they all wear their hearts on their sleeves in this movie and you can tell they cared about that outcome. You might not be able to see where I am coming from because this is such a raunchy and eccentric film. That just means you don't know Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone, Akiva Schaffer's comedy and might just want to stay away from one.

Spinal Tap Comparisons Are Inevitable But This Stands On Its Own,"Lonely Island was my introduction to Andy Samberg and his comedic prowess. He was a bright spot on SNL as well. I do feel that he is markedly underutilized in Brooklyn 99. That show itself is preposterous. Thankfully, there are movies like Popstar which give Samberg a chance to to do what he does best - act as if he is a genuine moron in a hilariously natural way. This movie is a work of satire that can't be overlooked. It is quite balanced in its critique of the music industry today. The mockumentary style and the fact that it focuses on mainstream music is obviously going to draw comparisons with 'This is Spinal Tap' but I would say cut it some slack. We all know how music has changed over time. What has remained consistent though, is the narcissism and un-hinged lifestyle of the stars. Sure, there are more things to buy now and the superstar man-child can just break more stuff when he's sad for the most stupid reasons but in essence it is all same old same old. On the sidenote, if you've to compare this movie then do it with Samberg's own - 7 days in hell. I think he is onto this mockumentary genre and is determined to perfect it.Popstar has its heart in the right place when it comes to the message - true friendship and simplicity matters at the end. There are moments in it that are similar to the Spinal Tap, for example when the band hits a low or when Nigel and David bury the hatchet and start playing music again. There are a lot of funny dialogues and shenanigans. Serving dog poop pancakes to test honesty among 'friends' being one. However, it does not take us into the unfamiliar zone. It doesn't tell us anything about the so called gods of pop music that we don't already know. How many times have we heard that music business is tough? As the band manager succinctly adds ""The highs are high and lows are really low"". Probably, that's the real irony of media that it parodies itself (the TMZ bit) within a satire and doesn't come off as anything shocking. Maybe that's the point of Popstar in showing him a little too honest with his fans on his Snapchat or Instagram but the fans still going crazy over his lameness. Well, who am I to complain? I can probably watch it a couple of times with friends just for the laughs.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

A blast of a movie without a single dull moment,"Really well-crafted and we'll-acted movie with a big heart and spot on parodies of popular hip hop. It's tricky to make a feature with tons of cameos that doesn't feel like a played out and overlong SNL sketch, but the Lonely Island boys manage it by keeping the emotions sincere instead of snide. Even the devastating parodies of the Beastie Boys, Macklemore, Insane Clown Posse etc come off as more loving than mean because there's such obvious genuine enthusiasm for the genre, including its glorious ridiculousness. The songs are hilarious, the cast is great-loved the pitch perfect supporting cast of Tim Meadows, Sarah Silverman, and Chris Redd. I'm a sucker for comedy that comes out of human foibles instead of insults and degradation, and this movie really delivered.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Comedy Gold. The Spinal Tap of a new generation.,"Satire can be tough to pull off. That said, Samberg has done it with this film. I can only imagine when they were writing this screenplay. They must have been rolling on the floor. It's a glimpse into the life and personal tribulations of a vapid popstar with marginal ability, major ego, propped up by his associations and past success.In spite of being insanely funny, from Conner's blissful ignorance, to his absurd lyrics, this film does have heart. Conner's journey is interesting and endearing. Though he is vapid and ignorant of reality, the truth sets in and hits him hard. There's only one thing worth making a film about: The human heart in conflict with itself. Popstar does that.Fair warning: The film cab be crude, but that is part of the period's humor. There's nothing too offensive for most adults, perhaps not for kids under 12 or 13 (though kids these days know more than we tend to give them credit for). All in all it's done with as much class as possible.Highly recommend checking this out. The cameos are great, and it does a great job following Conner's journey. The music is pretty solid, as well. This is the Spinal Tap of a new generation. Brilliant.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Amazing,"I'm not sure why the average score is at 6.9, because I enjoyed this movie a lot! Although some jokes were a little predictable because of the trailer I still thought this was over all an amazing ""mock- umentary"". Every song was catchy no matter how ridiculous the lyrics were, I understood surprisingly many references, such as DMZ (TMZ) and the Justin Timberlake and Michael Bolton nod backs to The Lonely Island's previous songs.Even though the movie is pretty exaggerated I think there's still a lot of truth in it, like having fake friends, how the media is portrayed and how stupid the public can seem when they blame celebrities for things that was obviously not their fault (Seal getting bit by wolves).Speaking of celebrities, I loved all the appearances, THERE WERE SO MANY! Usher, Emma Stone, Jimmy Fallon, 50 Cent, Ringo Starr, Simon Cowell and so, so many more, really impressive.According to the IMDb page they made around 10 million dollars less than they had for their budget, which is a shame because of how great all these characters were and that I would really love seeing a sequel with even more of dope songs and see where these characters go next.Lonely Island, never change <3",8.0,Anonymous,Music

"This is a funny comedy, that stays away from low hanging fruit","This movie never elevates beyond comedy (and slight satire), but it's really good at what it is. It's a funny movie. It's just a well crafted comedy.While the characters are all caricatured, they're still rooted in some sort of reality. They're dumb, but they're not Zoolander-dumb, they're not like characters from a kids movie. The conflict is actually quite believable, and it's never taken too far. The same goes for the reconciliation. It's easy to believe in. The most silly part of the movie is probably the songs, but they mostly work within the universe that's established.What I like the most, though, is how this movie tries to deliver solid jokes that stands on their own legs. It doesn't succumb to non-sequitors, sudden nostalgic references or slapstic. All of these forms of comedy has their use and place, but they're often overused, and a method of getting cheap laughs. This movie stays clear of those, making it all the better.The fun had by the people making this movie is also obvious, and you can't help but share the joy of it all. The cameos are fun, and well done.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Instant Classic,"Spinal Tap move over. This is the music mockumentary for today & will be held as the standard of which all that follows. I must confess that I'm not the biggest Andy Samberg fan, but I have always liked the Lonely Island. (Which reminds me, you couldn't find something for Chester Tam to do?) This movie is the culmination of all the years of learning and hard work. An instant classic that bombed at the box office, but will absolutely become a fan favorite for years to come. It's on HBO right now, so prepare yourself for multiple viewings & enjoy some of the best lyrics you will hear from any actor, possibly most rappers. Fans of Flight of the Conchords will not be disappointed. OK, that's enough knob slobbering, but I felt compelled to write a review because I was that impressed with this movie. Plus, in a few years I can look back and confirm if I was a bit ahead of my time, or I smoked way too much indica before I watched Popstar.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Fun and entertaining,"This film tells the story of a famous rapper group, and one of them, called Conner, goes solo. Conner achieves much success, but his career hits a series of lows when he releases his second solo album.The fun thing about this film is that at times it runs like a mock documentary. A lot of famous stars are interviewed, all proclaiming how amazing Conner is. That itself is so funny! The events portrayed are just so funny! I'm particularly amused by Seal making fun of himself. The songs Conner sings are at times so bad that makes me laugh out loud. I enjoy all the famous cameos too. I really enjoyed watching it, because it's so entertaining.",,Anonymous,Music
