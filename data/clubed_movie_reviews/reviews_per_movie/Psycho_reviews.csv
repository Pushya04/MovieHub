The Perkins Factor,"No matter how many times one sits through this Hitchcock classic, Anthony Perkins always manages to surprise you. It is a sensational performance - for which he didn't even get an Oscar nomination - I have no way of knowing how much preparation he dedicated to the creation of Norman Bates, maybe no more than usual, but the details of his performance are astonishing. Never a false move and if you follow the film looking into his eyes, you'll be amazed as I was. The madness and the tenderness, the danger and the cravings. A mamma's boy with hellish implications and yet we see, we feel connected to the human being, we are not horrified by him but of his circumstances. In short, we kind of understand him. That alone puts him miles and miles away from other cinematic monsters. From Richard Attenborough as the real life Christie in ""10 Rillington Place"" to the hideous, unredeemable Christian Bale in ""American Psycho"". Here Hitchcock and Herrman create an universe that Anthony Perkins inhabits with the same kind of electricity, nerve and shyness that Norman Bates projects throughout the film. Janet Leigh falls for it if not him. She, like us, sees the boy trying to escape his dutiful son's trap. He is in my list of the 10 most riveting characters ever to be captured on film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Anthony's Norman,"Getting into Hitchcock's Psycho, 57 years after its original release is like assisting to a masterclass of sorts. We can now identify what made this little lurid tale into a classic. Hitchcock himself, naturally, but now we know the first director's cut was a major disappointment and that Alma Reville - Hitch's wife - took over, re edited and the results have been praised, applauded and studied ever since. Janet Leigh's Marion Crane created a movie landmark with her shower scene. Bernard Herrmann and his strings created an extra character that we recognize as soon as it reappears under any disguise but, what shook me the most now in 2017 is Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates. His performance has evolved with the passing of time and its effect has remain as chilling, as moving, as funny and as real as it was in 1960. It's interesting to watch Gus Van Sant's 1998 version with Vince Vaugh as Norman Bates. If you look at the film, shot by shot with Berrnard Herrmann's strings - it's pretty fantastic. - Play it in black and white if you can. The problem and it is a monumental problem, we wait for Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins, if the casting of Anne Heche was really bad - not a hint of Janet Leigh's humanity, the casting of Vince Vaughn was incomprehensible. Not just not credible for a moment but annoying, very annoying. Anthony Perkins brought something profoundly personal to Norman Bates and as a consequence we connected with his sickness. We felt for him. Okay, sorry, I didn't mean to go there but I felt compelled to because I saw again Psycho (1960) ad Psycho (1998) at 24 hours from each other and realized that the main flaw of the 1998 versions is the absence of Anthony Perkins.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Curtains...,"An opportunity presents that can't be ignored, to escape from a world that's been making you bored, with dollars galore you ride out of town, pestered by a copper, who keeps hanging around; you seek to find shelter, somewhere to hide, the motel of Bates is the one that you've spied, there's a curious fella who's friendly, polite - you pay him for a room, and will stay for a night; after saying goodnight you retire to room, then into the bath for a showery flume, but before you're all clean you get into a lather, as the curtain is shred, by a bit of a slasher.Still a wonderful piece of filmmaking all these years later.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Hitchcock and Herrmann,"Robert Bloch wrote the original work, Joseph Stefano adapted it into a tight screenplay but it was Alfred Hitchcock with the extraordinary complicity of Bernard Herrmann who transformed this lurid tale into a classic, horror masterpiece. The score propels us into the moment before the moment arrives provoking the sort of anticipation that verges on the unbearable. The fact that the key scenes have become iconic film moments: copied, imitated, emulated and parodied, have not diminished its impact, not really. The anticipation, underlined by Herrmann's strings, creates a sort of craving for the moment to arrive. That doesn't happen very often. No amount of planning can produce it or re-produce it - otherwise how do you explain the Gus Van Sant version - so, the only possible explanation is an accident, a miraculous film accident and those do happen. Everything falls into place so perfectly that even the things that one may argue are below the smart standard of the film, are needed, the film without every frame is not quite the film. Try to turn away after the climax during Simon Oakland's long explanation. You can't. I couldn't. Partly because you know you'll soon be confronting those eyes, that fly, the car...",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Always holds me from beginning to end...,"...from the first time I saw it at age 14 until today whenever I run across it.This is the rare example of a much-ballyhooed film that is truly deserving of all the hype surrounding it. It would have been nice to have experienced the film without any knowledge of the plot twists. Unfortunately, for most viewers, the big surprises are not possible since so many of the scenes are part of our popular culture.There were, however, so many unexpected surprises.The opening scene with Janet Leigh and John Gavin in the hotel room was amazing and (pardon the cliché) so real. Hitchcock and Janet Leigh did a brilliant job of pulling us into Marion Crane's story, that of a woman in love with a divorced man who might as well be married considering his heavy financial obligations that leave him unable to marry in a practical sense even though he can in a legal sense. He doesn't even have a proper home - just a room in the back of the store he owns.Marion is then seemingly set up as the center of the movie as she thinks she has found a solution to her problems - a felonious one. Then the focus is skillfully shifted to the Norman Bates character as the ""protagonist"" victimized by his insane mother (or so it seemed) and then the focus is shifted once again to Marion's sister's search.The movie was adapted from a novel so some of the original audience would have been familiar with the plot of the book. In the novel, Norman Bates was a middle-aged man. I think it was a brilliant stroke to have the Norman of the film as a man in his twenties, a boy who never grew up in a man's body. Anthony Perkins is so identified today with his role of Norman Bates that it was surprising to see how endearingly he played him in the early scenes. And he did one of the best stammers I've ever seen in a movie when he was being questioned by the private detective (Martin Balsam) who is also searching for Marion. I also wasn't expecting to see how protective the local sheriff and his wife were of Norman when they were being questioned about him and his mother. You could tell they didn't want somebody (Norman) whom they thought had been dealt a bad hand to have anymore publicity and scrutiny than he already had.This film is mentioned in the documentary ""Moguls and Movie Stars"" as an example of how films were becoming more like TV as the 60s began - spartan art design and a script that was bold in the amount of sex and violence it had, even if the vast majority is implied. You have to be impressed by the versatility that is Hitchcock. Making movies in England? No problem. Making movies in the American studio system? No problem. Modernizing to deal with the evaporation of the production code? Again, no problem.Weird factoid - for you TCM fans out there Robert Osborne is credited as ""man"" in Psycho, although I don't remember him ever mentioning it. The only person it could possibly be unless he never comes close to having his face on camera is the parson as the sheriff and his wife are exiting church. See what you think.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Movie At The Crossroads Of Time,"What can you say about a film that's been talked about to death? Just this: If you've never seen it, you owe it to yourself to do so, not because it's a way of paying homage to the one true master of modern film, but because it's so fun to watch.Janet Leigh plays a bored office drone who decides to steal some loot from her boss's obnoxious client and parlay it into a new life with her all-too-distant boyfriend. All is going more or less according to plan until she stops in at the wrong motel, where she befriends a friendly if somewhat nerdy desk clerk only to find it causes problems with that clerk's possessive mother, who as her boy explains, ""is not herself today."" I'll say she isn't, and so would Leigh's Marion Crane, who maybe should have put up that ""Do-Not-Disturb"" sign before taking a shower.You can feel the decade literally shifting out of '50s and into '60s with this one. Even the opening shot, where the camera looks over a Western U.S. city in the middle of the afternoon and zooms in on what looks exactly like the Texas School Book Depository overlooking Dealey Plaza. Norman Rockwell touches abound, like the decor of the motel, but look at what's going on around it. People dress well, they still wear fedoras and jackets, but in their tense conversations and hooded gazes you can feel the culture just ticking away like a time bomb waiting to explode.Most especially, there's Anthony Perkins, who plays motel clerk Norman Bates in a very oddly naturalistic way, complete with facial tics and half-swallowed words, not the polished image one expected to see then. Just compare him with John Gavin, who plays Marion's boyfriend in the standard-actor-of-the-day way. Perkins manages to be so weirdly magnetizing, even in small moments like the way he stumbles on the word ""falsity"" or notes how creepy he finds dampness to be.He shines in bigger scenes, too, like his tense chat with Martin Balsam's boorish but diligent private detective character, Arbogast, who along with Perkins and Leigh delivers a landmark performance. The way both actors play out the awkwardness in their conversation makes you literally sweat. Then again, you're always uneasy around Norman. You definitely feel wary of him right away, but you find yourself liking him, too, even when he's busy covering up ""Mother's"" misdeeds. Not since Bela Legosi played Dracula did you get a horror movie with such a compelling central figure.If you are sampling the many other comments here, be sure to look up Merwyn Grote's. He makes an interesting, compelling case for how director Alfred Hitchcock used his television series as a template for ""Psycho."" Certainly ""Psycho"" looks more like early 1960s television than any of the more sumptuous fare Hitchcock had been bringing to screen at the time. Not only is it in black-and-white, not color, but the sets; a ramshackle motel, a mothbally old house, a couple of cheap looking bedrooms, a bathroom in a used-car dealership, are deliberately low class.It's thrilling to see Hitchcock move so effectively outside his normal element, and move things along with such clinical detachment and low-key technical finesse. Thrilling, too, to realize this is one of his most accomplished products; made by a man who was experienced enough to know how the game was played, and daring enough still to break the rules; indeed, start a whole new ballgame.Is it the best Hitchcock movie? It's definitely one of his best, right up there with ""The 39 Steps"" and ""Strangers On A Train"" and ""Sabotage"" and ""Shadow Of A Doubt."" He only once again came close to making as good a film, with ""The Birds,"" while Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins never escaped the greatness they helped create here. Poor John Gavin had to quit the biz entirely, and became an ambassador.Often imitated, parodied, referenced, and analyzed to death, ""Psycho"" still isn't played out nearly 45 years after it came out. You owe it to yourself to pay a visit to the Bates Motel; Norman has a room ready.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Greatest Horror Film Ever,"When you look up the phrase ""Horror Film"" in the dictionary .. a picture of Janet Leigh screaming in a shower should appear next to it. Undoubtedly, Psycho is the greatest horror film ever made, bar-none. The story is incredible. The acting is near perfection. The cinematography is godly. The soundtrack is perfect. It's hard to find anything wrong with Psycho. Perhaps the only imperfection I can find with Psycho is the inability to stand the test of time. One of the reasons the shower scene has become so notorious is that it's not only filmed to perfection, but because the elements of sexuality and murder are so surreal. In 1960, seeing a nude women being murdered in a shower was something that no-one had experienced yet, and was quite shocking. Nowadays, seeing Jason double-spearing two lovers having sex is nothing uncommon. I envy those who experienced Psycho in 1960 in the theaters .. those experienced the full terror of Psycho.Aside from this though, the movie is flawless. I won't even go into to how incredible the cinematography is. One thing I think people seem to forget about the movie is the incredible soundtrack. Sound is such an important element in movies and Psycho is undaunted when it comes to sound. The only other horror movie that even comes close to using sound with such perfection is Halloween (1978).The movie is perfectly casted as well. Janet Leigh as the beautiful Marion Crane, Vera Miles as the concerned sister, Lila Crane, and of course the unforgettable performance from Anthony Perkins as the eerie yet charismatic Norman Bates.I would recommend this movie to any horror movie film fanatic. I would especially recommend this movie to any horror movie fan not desensitized by Friday The 13th, Nightmare On Elm Street, or Scream .. if such a fan exists.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
An intelligent thriller/horro,"As with most very old films, Psycho is unlikely to have the same impact on a modern audience than it had upon its first release. So those who are watching it expecting the 'masterpeice' they are often told it is, prepare to be disappointed. Having said that, if you take Psycho of its pedestal as 'one of the greatest films of all time' (though through a historical perspective and in terms of influence, the title is richly deserved' and watch it treat it for what it is, a psychological horror, than the film remains very enjoyable. The acting performance put on by Anthony Perkins is highly believable and at times chilling and, if you have not been exposed to the shows twists and ending already, they still have the potential to shock and surprise even the most seasoned horror fan. On the subject of horror fans, it is worth a watch on that merit alone or for any fan of cinema, to see the film that has shaped cinema today more than almost any other film",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Two Words: Hitchcock's Best (...and you know that's no small feat!),"Yes, everything you've heard is true. The score is a part of pop culture. The domestic conflict is well-known. But nothing shocks like the experience itself.If you have not seen this movie, do yourself a favor. Stop reading thse comments, get up, take a shower, then GO GET THIS MOVIE. Buy it, don't rent. You will not regret it.""Psycho"" is easily the best horror-thriller of all time. Nothing even comes close...maybe ""Les Diaboliques"" (1955) but not really.""Psycho"" has one of the best scripts you'll ever find in a movie. The movie's only shortcoming is that one of the characters seems to have little motivation in the first act of the movie but as the story progresses, you realize that Hitchcock (GENIUS! GENIUS! GENIUS!) in a stroke of genius has done this on purpose, because there is another character whose motivations are even more important. Vitally important. So important that you totally forget about anything else. I was lucky enough to have spent my life wisely avoiding any conversation regarding the plot of this movie until I was able to see it in full. Thank God I did! The movie has arguably the best mid-plot point and climactic twist in thriller history, and certainly the best-directed ending. The last few shots are chilling and leave a lingering horror in the viewer's mind.Just as good as the writing is Hitchcock's direction, which is so outstanding that it defies explanation. Suffice it to say that this movie is probably the best directorial effort by film history's best director. I was fortunate enough to see this movie at a big oldtime movie house during a Hitchcock revival. Janet Leigh, still radiant, spoke before the film and explained how Hitchcock's genius was in his ability to 1) frighten without gore and 2) leave his indelible mark on the movie without overshadowing his actors (like the great Jean Renoir could never do). ""Psycho"" is clearly its own phenomenon, despite all the big-name talent involved.Hitchcock does not disappoint by leaving out his trademark dark humor. His brilliance is in making a climax that is at once both scary and hilarious. When I saw it in the theatre the audience was both gasping in disbelief while falling-on-the-floor laughing.One more thing...Tony Perkins. Janet Leigh got much-deserved accolades for this film, but it is Perkins who gives what remains the single best performance by an actor in a horror movie. He is so understated that his brillance passes you by. He becomes the character. The sheer brillance of the role is evidenced by the ineptitude of the actors in Gus Van Sant's 1998 (dear God make it stop!) shot-for-shot ""remake."" Though the movies are nearly identical, Hitchcock's is superior mostly because of the acting and the atmosphere (some of the creepiness is lost with color). This is made obvious by the initial conversation between Leigh's character and Perkins, a pivotal scene. The brilliance of Perkins in the original shines even brighter when compared with the ruination in the remake even though the words and the shots were exactly the same. The crucial chemistry in this scene lacking in the remake gives everything away and mars our understanding of upcoming events. The fact that Perkins could never escape this role - his star stopped rising star as it had done in the 50s - proves that he played the part perhaps too well.I keep using the word brilliant, but I cannot hide my enthusiasm for this movie. It is wholly unlike the overblown, overbudget, overlong fluff spewing all-too-often out of Hollywood today. ""Psycho"" is simple, well-crafted and just the right length.Eleven-and-a-half out of ten stars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I Didn't Think It Lived Up To Its Reputation,"""Psycho"" has gone down in Hollywood history as one of the greatest of horror movies, and even if you've never seen it (which I hadn't until today) you still feel a certain connection to the movie just on the basis of its reputation. That in itself can be a problem, because you're expecting a lot when you watch it for the first time. Unfortunately, for me at least, this didn't quite live up to its billing. It was a good movie, Alfred Hitchcock did a good job of directing with a number of what are today recognized as typical ""Hitckcock-ian"" touches, particularly with some very effective camera work, and basically the cast, headed by Anthony Perkins as motel owner Norman Bates and supported by Janet Leigh, Vera Miles, John Gavin and Martin Balsam (I would say in that order of importance to the story) did a fine job. Still, I was expecting something more.First, I would call this more of a suspense movie with a touch of slasher movie thrown in than a horror movie, although that's admittedly through a modern lens. There are really only a couple of scenes that were ""horrific"" - one being the famous shower scene and one being the revelation of Norman's mother near the end of the movie. Otherwise you get a mystery - with the end surprise being fairly clearly telegraphed to anyone who was paying attention. The suspense starts with Marion (Leigh) stealing a large sum of money from the real estate agency where she works and running off, eventually coming to the Bates Motel to spend the night. Since the murder in the shower is the classic scene of the movie, you don't expect it to come as early as it does, and you don't expect that so much of the movie is going to revolve around Lila (Miles) and Sam (Gavin) as they search for Marion. Somehow, I expected to see more of Janet Leigh. Still, there is good suspense even if the surprise about Norman's mother is pretty clear from even a mile away.What knocked this down a bit for me, though, wasn't the obvious solution to the mystery. It was the seeming need to offer a very in depth psychological explanation near the end of what Norman was all about. Maybe there was a sense that movie-goers in 1960 would need such an explanation. I found what was virtually a closing soliloquy (and a very long one) by Simon Oakland playing a psychiatrist who's called in to examine Norman to be tedious in the extreme, and largely unnecessary; filled with psycho-babble. Norman could have been explained - if an explanation was felt necessary - much more succinctly.One can't diss this movie. There's really very little wrong with it, except that its reputation makes it very hard for it to live up to when you watch it. Undoubtedly, when watched with late 20th-21st century eyes (well conditioned to the point of being almost oblivious to slasher-type violence) it comes across as a bit dull, frankly. Equally undoubtedly, it didn't come across that way to audiences in 1960. Still, I found it to be a little bit of a letdown compared to what I was expecting of it.

"Good, but overrated and unintentionally funny","""Psycho"" was definitely a decent film, no surprise as it was made by the great Hitchcock at the top of his game. But the film was just too predictable and had too many laughs where they were not supposed to be.I mean seriously. I can't speak for the crowds in 1960, but if anyone watches this for the first time today, it's pretty obvious where this entire picture is going after we go to the motel for the first time. The title itself is clue enough (he's a ""psycho"" after all) but really, I can't see anyone not guessing the big 'secret' of this flick way before the ending.The film's main characters are cast superbly. Janet Leigh looks great and sexy, keeping the film from being too boring because she's so beautiful and good on screen. And of course Anthony Perkins does a pretty decent job. He doesn't give the awe-inspiring heart-stopping performance that fans of the flick seem to think he gives, but he is very good indeed.The ingredients of the movie are put together very nicely, with the music and editing utilized for the maximum effect. Hitchcock definitely shows why he's known as such a great talent in these respects, putting it all together beautifully.Unfortunately, the film suffers from too many laughs where they aren't supposed to be. When Norman first indicated he's a little ""psycho,"" it's very funny watching him and his serious face as he gives clues he's such a nut case. With ""Mother,"" whenever ""she"" talks (and yells), it's just too funny not to laugh at it. Even the scene when Norman carries ""Mother"" form her room is funny, as she talks her nonsense as he carries her out with her legs dangling.And the ""shocking"" cellar scene almost plays like a comedy skit nowadays. When ""Mother"" is turned around in the chair, what you see just looks too funny not to laugh, and when Norman comes in, combined with his face, the way he was dressed, and the ""Psycho music"" at full bombast, I couldn't help but crack up for ten minutes at the hilarious combination of all this. Sorry to say, what was supposed to be such a frightening scene, is just too comedic to truly scare anymore.It's unreal to think ""Psycho"" was voted one of the scariest films ever made. Who does this movie actually scare?And the cop at the end, with his long-winded speech that sums up the whole picture (conveniently with the rest of the cast sitting and listening intently), is just too blatantly pandering that you just want to say, ""ok, I think we all get it now!"" You almost expect the cop to turn to the crowd in the theater and say, ""ok, does everyone understand now?""Even the very last shot of Norman is kind of funny, with the expressions he is making. The skull kind of saves the scene, but still.""Psycho"" is still recommended viewing for any old school movie fan, just to see Hitchcock's work. But the challenge is not to laugh at many certain scenes. The ""Making of"" documentary on the DVD is pretty decent (if not somewhat long winded itself) but the omission of deleted or rare scenes is definitely noticed. Janet Leigh is still very sharp though, and still looks great.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Perkins Is Remarkable,"Most modern-day horror films make the killer to be an absolutely inhuman, grotesque, unimaginable monster in order to scare the audience out of its wits.  Most of the time, however, these stereotypes create a generic murderer a raving, ranting, clearly demented psychopath.  One of the few memorable cinematic killers that does not adhere to these restraints and cliches is, of course, Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter, whom manages to effectively cause the audience to recoil without such drek as the aforementioned devices.Anthony Perkins' skillfully crafts his performance as Norman Bates, avoiding a ranting, raving, drooling, murder-happy, manic characterization; instead his performance as Norman is subtle, creepy, cool, and unsettling.  He is brilliant; from his quiet conversations with Marion Crane amidst the stuffed birds, to his weasling wimpiness when confronted by Arbogast, his performance is so exact that it chills the viewer, all without the unnecessary disturbing images prevalent in more modern films (read The Cell, Henry: Portrait of A Serial Killer).Perkin's fine performance, a tight script, and Bernstein's classic score make Psycho a film that is now and will always be remembered as one of the pinnacles of the horror genre.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Hitchcock makes a masterpiece,"I am a big fan of Alfred Hitchcock.  I have seen all of his movies, and think all of them are excellent.  This one, however, is at the top of the food chain.  Psycho is brilliant.  Hitchcock gave this film excellent direction, and the acting was superb.  Especially Anthony Perkins playing the role of Norman Bates.  He always talked so fast, like he was nervous and anxious all the time.  When he talked to Marion Crane about his mother, it gave me chills down my spine.  ""She just...she just goes a little mad sometimes.  We all go a little mad sometimes.""  At that era, I don't think a better person could have delivered that line than Anthony Perkins.  What makes this movie so great is its originality.  Sure, there have been lots of films about ""psychos,"" but this is pretty much the first one.  The script was excellent, the acting was excellent, the direction was excellent, the cinematography was excellent, the music was excellent, the scenery was incredible, especially that dark old house where ""Mother"" lived.

Perkins Irreplaceable?,"Hitchcock was very fortunate to have cast the young Anthony Perkins in the leading role.  At the time there were some other young aspiring actors who might have qualified for the part, namely:  Michael J. Pollard; Jack Nicholson; Bruce Dern, Dean Stockwell, Victor Buono and Dennis Hopper.  However, it's hard for me to imagine anyone other than Perkins playing Norman Bates with complete authenticity, it's seems the role was simply made for him and only him.  Could you possibly imagine anyone other than Nicholson in the role of Randall P. McMurphy in ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" or Dennis Hopper as Billy in ""Easy Rider""?  Keep in mind the introverted, insecure Mama's Boy was not really PSYCHOpathic as Hannibal The Cannibal was in ""Silence of the Lambs"" - a cold-blooded killer with no conscience - but rather criminally insane, plagued by schizophrenic delusions and seriously in need of multiple reality-checks.  Anthony Hopkins did a wonderful job as the vicious Hannibal, and also as Corky, the schizo-killer ventriloquist in ""Magic"".  I think he just might have pulled off a convincing Norman, but don't believe he was available back then.  Oh well, so much for speculation...Perkins did a great job.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
This is what good movies are all about.,"This is one of the best movies ever created and Alfred Hitchcock is one of the most intriguing film makers ever to live. (in my opinion) There's just so much to say about this film I hardly know where to start.I first saw this movie about five years ago and wasn't impressed at all. Of course, I was about ten years old at the time. I didn't think that the famous shower scene was anything to frightening and the characters seemed a little boring. A little less than a year ago, I became very interested in the history of the film and not so much of the film itself. I read articles, reviews, anything that I could get my hands on. Then, Psycho was shown on AMC and I immediately thought that it was a masterpiece. Shame on me for not appreciating it sooner.The film as a whole is spectacular, but I like to break it down into little sections. First, I was very surprised and impressed with the actors that played Marion Crane and Norman Bates. Janet Leigh isn't given to much exposure to the film since she is killed off in about the middle of it. I thought that she did a good but not great job. On the other hand, Anthony Perkins blew me away. Both Norman and Anthony are very interesting. Norman's life that is set up and shown to us is so well depicted that I can't imagine anybody else playing the part. All of the characters including Arbogast, Lila, and Sam are so well created.Obviously, the plot is so unique and odd that you can't help but smile at it. A young woman on the run after stealing $40,000, and then accidentally falls into the wrong hands of a psychopath. It's great! The best thing is that nobody has ever done anything quite like it, and they won't be able to because then the magic will be gone.Even though the ever so famous shower scene is said to be one of the most chilling death scenes in history, I think that it may be a little overrated. I love it as much as the next person, but it's not all that scary. Who said it was supposed to be scary? Nobody, I know. But the majority of the Psycho audience gathers it to be very frightening. I do still think that it is one of the greatest and shocking scenes ever.The setting is very well set up as well. The Bates motel and house is so cleverly created that it brings a special atmosphere to the audience. It has something about it that you just can't forget.Finally, that music played throughout the film is one of the most spookiest sounds I have ever heard. Great job to the music composers and to Hitchcock for this scary addition to the movie.I think it's safe to say that everybody has heard of Psycho, but not everyone has seen it. For those of you who still haven't seen this amazing flick, go see it! It's a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Hitchcock Masterpiece.,"Marion Crane steals $40,000 from her employer, running away from suspicions and her own guilt, she checks into The Bates Motel, a quiet, out of the way establishment, run by Norman Bates.Oh boy, this film is quite something. Hitchcock truly was the master of suspense, but he proves he could do horror to, Psycho is the perfect fusion of Horror and Suspense.What audiences in 1960 must have thought when they say down to watch this for the first time, when you think what had come before, this film truly was a game changer.Pacing is sensational, it doesn't hold up for a second, the suspense element is tremendous, first time viewers are in for several shocks, when the big moments come, they are hammered home.There are several sensational scenes, but that shower sequence, that rates as one of the greatest movie moments of all time.Anthony Perkins delivers a performance which is nothing short of remarkable, he's so soft and gentle initially, but the switch up, is incredible. Why he wasn't Oscar nominated is beyond me.The music, as big a character as Norman Bates himself, even on the opening sequences it's powerful and alarming, but the score that accompanies the killings, talk about hairs standing up on the back of the neck.One of my top ten greatest film of all time.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"A film that you see once, and never forget...","I am a huge fan of Hitchcock, and have really liked all of the movies of his I have seen so far. My top 5 favourites are Vertigo, North By Northwest, Rear Window, Rebecca and this masterpiece. Before I saw this, I considered Vertigo as his masterpiece. After seeing this movie, I think Psycho outshines Vertigo.Psycho is a film that you see once and never forget, and one of the few movies out there that has left me traumatised. The infamous shower scene is without doubt one of the most terrifying murder scenes in any film. When I first saw that scene on the 100 Greatest American Films, I was so terrified and I admit it I have never recovered. I had a similar experience watching the Disney film Sleeping Beauty with Maleficent enticing Aurora to the spinning wheel, and Mrs Gulch turning into the Wicked Witch in the Wizard of Oz.The shower scene isn't the only effective or chilling scene in the film- in the events leading up to that scene I was biting my nails. The scene with the old woman in the chair also made me jump out of my skin. The whole of Psycho is terrifying, suspenseful and shocking. Two elements made this so. One was Hitchock's direction. The great director proves how truly great he is by directing Psycho in a masterful way, and manages to deliver the shocks when needed. The other is Bernard Hermann's music. What a creepy score! I loved his score for Vertigo and Miklos Rozsa's for Spellbound, but the high violin motif in the shower scene is the main reason why that scene in particular is so effective. I admit it, when I hear that motif, I start screaming. There is just something about it that makes your blood run cold.Other pros are a good plot, a well constructed screenplay and beautiful black and white cinematography that is perfect in conveying the creepy mood. And the ending did surprise me. The acting though was exemplary, with Janet Leigh giving one of the deservedly most memorable female performances in a Hitchcock movie, and Vera Miles also giving a stellar performance. Stealing the film is Antony Perkins as Norman Bates, he didn't just play creepy, he WAS creepy, his face, his voice, his mannerisms.. in short it is one of the most chilling performances of all time. All in all, a Hitchcock masterpiece! 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Hithcock masterpiece in his most accomplished and perfect movie,"This famous film with known story tells about Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) , she works in a Phoenix (Arizona) office, when his employer trusts her some money . Seeing the opportunity to take the cash and beginning a new life along with her fiancé Sam (John Gavin) . Larcenous Marion leaves Phoenix and heads with her car towards California where her lover with debts is owner a store . When is caught in a storm and pursued by a policeman , she leaves the highway and enters Bates hotel . The hotel with twelve rooms (and 12 showers) is managed by a strange young (Anthony Perkins) who seems to be submitted by his overbearing mother , she's living at a creaky mansion nearly hotel. Then, rare things start to happen . Later on , a detective named Arbogast (Martin Balsam) , her sister (Vera Miles) and Sam (John Gavin) are looking for Marion , asking for help a stubborn sheriff (John McIntire).¨Psycho¨ was not only Hitchcock's biggest successful movie , but was a phenomenon in its own right . The picture is a magnum opus in the terror genre and its immediate impact and its future influence was enormous and cannot be over emphasised . It's the quinta-essential shocker that created an authentic sub-genre about psycho-killers and continuing until nowadays . The shower image is one of the most studied , copied and analysed sequences in cinema history and has obtained a notoriety what exceeds of the movie itself . Terrific performance by Anthony Perkins in an immortal role as Norman Bates and sensational Janet Leigh with Oscar nomination included that was the only one in her long career. Inventive and superbly constructed plot , filled with delicious black humor by writer Joseph Stefano based on Robert Bloch's novel. The highlight of the film is , of course , the shower scene , it was made with 70 cameras to shot the 45 seconds of footage and the creepy sound effects were realized by stabbing a knife into a melon . Magnificent credit titles by Saul Bass , he's usual on Hitchcock films .Excellent black and white cinematography by cameraman John Russell , as Hitch thought it would be very gory in colour . Bernard Herrmann's legendary musical score copied and endlessly imitated , aids to create a thrilling atmosphere . Film is directed with exquisite taste and intelligence by master Hitchcock who makes an impeccable control of every scene and maneuvers your emotions , infusing with a deliciously macabre wit , it makes ¨Psycho¨ far superior to the several movies what tried duplicate , or imitate it ; these are the following ones : ¨Psycho II¨ (1983) by Richard Franklin , ¨Psycho III¨ (1986) by Anthony Perkins himself and for cable television : ¨Psycho IV¨ (1990) by Mick Garris. Hitchcock's Psycho belongs to his best period in the 5os and 60s when he produced his finest works , perfecting the art of suspense in a series of masterpieces : ¨Dial M¨, ¨Rear window¨, ¨Vertigo¨, ¨North by Nortwest¨, ¨Birds¨ and specially ¨Psycho¨ , all of them are still studied and copied today . Rating : Indispensable and essential classic movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Hitchcock At His Very Best,"Psycho is the all time greatest movie ever made in movie making history. It has this special style that could only be achieved through the eyes of Alfred Hitchcock and the excellent actors in the film.  There is this mysteriousness that presides over the movie, and that is what adds to the overall feeling from Psycho. Hitchcock's eye for great suspense really does the trick for this movie. He also chose to go Black and White in this movie, instead of color for his own stylistic purposes (and to hide the redness of...yeah.) The B&W really makes the movie more ""scary"". No one can forget the Bates Motel or the mysterious house on the hill behind it with ""that person"" in the window.  Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates also has his best performance of his career in this movie, bringing the character of Norman Bates to life. Even 40 years later, no movie is able to stand up to Psycho or make a larger impact on world culture.  Truly the best movie of all time, definitely a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Legendary, in both a good and a bad way","Not much to be said about this that hasn't been said before.  Only the second Hitchcock film I've ever seen, and so far there isn't a single positive thing that's been said about him that I can disagree with. Calling someone 'The Master' is terminology that I would usually frown upon as being too dismissive of other greatly talented people, but after witnessing the directing, the cinematography, the subtle performances, the inimitable atmosphere and the quiet genius of this masterpiece, I find myself forced to agree.  The notorious shower scene manages to be shocking, brutal and understated all at once, and its infamy on the pages of motion picture history is well-deserved.  Anthony Perkins is subtly explosive, like a match waiting to be struck.  He plays Bates with a boyish, grinning charm that generally belies his chilling insanity.  Also worthy of mention is Bernard Herrmann's incredible score, possibly one of the best I've ever heard.In a curious way, the one thing I find disagreeable about this movie is, indeed, its legend.  I cannot imagine how much I would have enjoyed it had I not known any of the plot twists beforehand, and could have gone into it unknowingly.  Still, perhaps somewhat paradoxically, the legend is completely due, because this film's merit becomes obvious when you consider that first-time viewers of my generation (I'm 21 years old), who have become inundated with the blood, gore and overblown special effects of today's blockbusters, can still find its subtle ingenuity chilling and scary in equal measure.  Beautiful. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Best In Its Time,This movie is the best movie by Alfred Hitchcock ever.  That is hard to do to.  Because he did all the good scary movies back then such as Rear Window and The Birds.  I loved it I own the movie and parts 2 and 3 I like the shower scene.  Another good thing about this movie was that it had a good back ground the motel off the main highway and the creepy old house on the hill behind the motel this was scary for its time but not now.  However it still is a real good movie a classic.  The remake was ok but it can't match to this one.,,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Still one of the scariest films to date; Hitchcock's best film,"Psycho is an extremely suspenseful, scary and wonderful film. For being filmed in Black and White, it also has an artistic feel to it like all Hitchcock films. The acting, dialogue and filming in this film are fantastic, something that feels it shouldn't be out of 1960 but is. At the end, (which I won't spoil) I was absolutely shocked, to say the least I didn't see it coming.Psycho is easily Hitchcock's best film and if you haven't watched it I would highly recommend.10/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Look at the movie as a whole,"Okay, I'll agree that the shower scene is one of the scariest in movie history.  Hitchcock did an amazing job with that.

One of the best movies ever made!,"**Please excuse me for some spelling mistakes**This is the BEST HORROR/THRILLER/SCARY MOVIE IN THE WORLD! I just love this movie! Since I am a true movielover I do not mind that it is in black and white at all. The actors were great and still today it is a bit creepy when the thievish Marion Crane chooses the wrong place to spend the night on (and the wrong shower, ha ha ha). Perkins is SO perfect as Norman Bates and the voice of mother really made me shiver. The movie is filled with classic lines that I won't forget even if I'll isolate myself for 20 years. For those who can't stand old movies, or are'nt any real movielovers this will be a sleeping pill. But for us with a good taste it will be a very good experience. Don't get me wrong, i mean ''The Blair Witch project'' for example is scarier than ''Psycho'' but ''Psycho'' is creepier and better than any other thriller!Watch out for the remake from 1998, it really sucks!!!!!!10 out of 10 OF COURSE!!!!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"""A boy's best friend is his mother. ""","Without a doubt one of the most influential films of all time. Timeless classic.Whether this is a true slasher film is debatable, but it's influence on the genres of horror and suspense/thriller is undeniable.This masterpiece uses amazing black and white cinematography and a very low bodycount (yes, that's correct, a very low bodycount) to weave a fascinating story of a woman caught in a criminal web of her own doing who stops off at the wrong motel on a wet and rainy night. She meets the inn-keeper, a fragile and soft spoken young man who is emotionally and verbally pushed around by his overbearing mother.What follows is a tension filled and horrifying tale of psychological suspense. I have heard others comment that this film is not really ""scary"", and I beg to differ. Nothing to me could be more terrifying than the reality that people like some of those presented in this film truly exist in our world. It takes a lot more than fake blood and overly-gory special effects to impress me, and the sad thing is that today's ""horror"" films and even some claiming to be suspense films rely too much on the supernatural or just plain disgusting to achieve their affect. None of that for me thanks.One of my true pleasures is to see someone view this film for the first time. Moments in the film tend to shock or surprise people who think they've seen it all. Those who have seen enough knock-offs (and there are a TON of them) may figure out some of the story's plot before it is revealed, but only because so many films have shamelessly ripped this one off.

"Technical excellence, at its best.","Ever wonder what the movie history would be like, if the ""genius"" of Hitchcock, were never brought to silver screen? Aside from the story line, the cast, and the acting, the highest point of this film, to myself, is the camera direction. Being a past film and tv school grad', all I can say is, this one is a masterpiece. The angles and the way he let's the camera, lead or suggest to the viewer, the next scene,is alone, among the best direction of any movie. To see what Im saying, when next shown, turn the volume off, and just let the camera , under his direction, tell you the story.

"Timing, Hitchcock made it special.","In reading the comments of some, I think that to have seen Hitchcock's Psycho when it opened in '60, is to fully understand its impact today. It was a masterpiece then and remains a masterpiece today. Superior direction and camera work, and as one person commented, the film was released at a time when [psychological] monsters in the form of the ""boy next door,"" was not explored in films. Yes, Psycho started slow by today's standards, but the style back then was to move from the pleasant familiar to the darkest of horrors. Hitchcock understood how to create atmosphere and mood. His shower scene, while some today wonder what the hoopla is all about, set a standard of horror in an ordinary setting. How many films have copied this scene? I remember as a kid, fearing showers and hotels after seeing this flick. Hitchcock reportedly said that it was a good thing he didn't place Crane on the toilet (sic), or people would have a phobia about toilets. Ironically, in Psycho 3 (?), a character was killed while on the toilet. The remake of two years ago sucked--big time. Hitchcock's Psycho not only had the master at the helm, but it was also a matter of timing in cinema history. Those elements cannot be duplicated.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Hmm;,"A lot of people have different opinions on this, mines rather mixed. There is only one bit of this movie i didn't fully understand (and I may sound completely dumb for mentioning it, it's probably something rather easy to understand!) but in the film, the male hotel keeper carry's his mother down the stairs after asking her to hide and you can see him carry his mother down stairs but later on in the movie the policeman says he dressed up as his mother and acted like her etc? If that's so, who was the women that he carried down the stairs?

Best horror movie of all times??,"Sorry, but I've never understood why ""Psycho"" is considered by so many people to be the best horror movie of all times (I give it only 7/10). Very influental it is, yes. Maybe also I've just seen a bit too many dozens of mass murderer movies based more or less on ""Psycho"", that the original doesn't feel so special anymore?I think that a good movie must stand time and can be watched many times over and over again. Why should one want to watch ""Psycho"" again? The plot is so easy to guess even when seeing the movie first time that I find there not too much excitement.What's the plot and idea of this movie? Some nut just goes killing innocent people, because he's crazy, and that's the whole story. Period. Scary? Well, as much as irrational violence is scary.I also find it disgusting that in many horror movies psychotic people are often portrayed as the cause of all evil, when most of them are only very sick and mostly not particularly harmful to anyone. What is really scary - in real life or on a film - are people basically having everything ok and a good mental health, but still often doing horrible things, including irrelevant violence. Most violence in the world is done by such ""normal"" people.I think that Hitchcock has many better movies than ""Psycho"". For example ""Rear Window"" is a true classic in its minimalism, though maybe not particularly scary, at least in the way modern horror movies playing mainly on special effects are. Anyway, there you have just an ordinary guy, could be your nextdoor neighbour, who cruelly kills his wife etc., Now that's a scary idea, and the plot makes you think too.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A True Classic.,"I feel that this movie is superior to Alfred Hitchcock's other films and that it, rather than ""Vertigo"", should be considered his masterpiece.

Just seeing how disturbed Norman Bates is, is a very creepy thing.  Hitchcock filmed this without one imperfection.  He used a lot of mirrors in Psycho, and I personally think the scariest scene in the entire movie is where Marion's sister goes up to ""Mrs. Bates"" room, and she thinks she sees someone behind her, and turns around, but its just herself in the mirror.  Another very interesting thing about Psycho was all the bird references.  Marion's last name is ""Crane"" Norman even says to her ""You eat like a bird"" and Norman's office is filled with stuffed birds.  Psycho's shower scene is by far the most suspenseful moment in the history of film.  I think so anyway!

Alfred Hitchcock's Cult Classic !!,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho,"" released in 1960, remains one of the most influential films in the history of cinema, setting new standards for the thriller genre with its groundbreaking techniques and psychological depth. From its iconic score to its masterfully crafted suspense, ""Psycho"" has left an indelible mark on filmmaking and storytelling.The film introduces us to Marion Crane, played by Janet Leigh, who impulsively decides to steal a large sum of money and escape from her mundane life. Her journey leads her to the secluded Bates Motel, where she encounters the enigmatic and unsettling owner, Norman Bates, portrayed brilliantly by Anthony Perkins. What unfolds is a captivating story filled with unexpected twists and turns that keep viewers on the edge of their seats.Hitchcock utilizes innovative filmmaking techniques that were revolutionary for its time. The stark black-and-white cinematography enhances the eerie ambiance, and the carefully composed shots create a sense of unease that permeates the film. The famous shower scene, with its rapid cuts and haunting score, is not only a pivotal moment in the narrative but also a striking example of Hitchcock's ability to manipulate viewer emotions.The score, composed by Bernard Herrmann, is another standout element of ""Psycho."" The shrieking strings evoke tension and terror, perfectly complementing the film's startling moments and enhancing its psychological impact. Herrmann's music has since become emblematic of horror cinema, signifying dread in the most minimalist yet effective manner.The performances are outstanding, particularly Janet Leigh, whose portrayal of Marion Crane invites sympathy and connection from the audience. Anthony Perkins delivers a haunting performance as Norman Bates, straddling the line between charm and menace, and leaving viewers questioning his true nature.""Psycho"" delves into themes of identity, morality, and the darker aspects of human nature, inviting a range of interpretations and discussions. It challenges characters' motivations and decisions, presenting moral dilemmas that resonate throughout the narrative, leading to a haunting exploration of the human psyche.Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" is a timeless thriller that combines suspense, psychological depth, and innovative storytelling. Its influence on the horror genre and cinema as a whole cannot be overstated. Even decades after its release, ""Psycho"" continues to captivate audiences, proving that true horror often lies in the complexities of the human mind.

Filmed in black and white, everything in this movie--the music, the dialogue, the scenery, etc. is perfectly in sync and is a big reason this movie is a classic.  One bad thing is that I read somewhere that one of the goofs in the movie is when Janet Leigh is killed in the bathroom and staring at the camera, you can see her adam's apple moving.  I had never noticed that, but after reading that I noticed it the next time I watched it and it sort of ruined the illusion for me.  Oh well, that was about the only thing wrong with this movie.

"A classic. Hitchcock's greatest film. Everything is perfectly done and the film has the most famous scene in movie history you know the scene ""The Shower Scene"".","Hitchcock's 1960 classic Psycho has it all to start with romance, embezzlement, disappearance, secrets, voyeurism, a dead corpse, a split personality of a man who thinks from time to time he's his dead mother and of course death in the most famous scene of all time the scene of Janet Leigh getting stabbed to death in the shower. The first time I saw Psycho as a kid and seeing the shower scene it terrified me so much I actually became afraid to take a shower I had great fear of getting stabbed to death even in my own home. As any child would do myself included they grow away from the terror of scare scenes as age increases, but recently I have looked at the famous shower scene from a different perspective. Many are unaware but it took seven days to shoot the shower scene, seventy camera positions for the forty-five seconds of very famous footage not an actual bare breast or plunging knife is to be found in the final cut, just illusion through montage. Now I begin my discussion on montage for those who don't know it's meaning or importance. Montage is a distinct type of editing that brings more drama to film and it links shots of film together and the editing separates and makes a film different from other forms of art. Montage was developed from the Soviet Union. Montage was used in very distinct ways in Psycho mostly crafted from Russian editor and director Eisenstein whose editing technique clashing of images or more properly known as a graphic match in film. Actually both similar terms can be explained first clashing of images create conflict just as in the shower scene the images flashing quickly of the knife and Janet Leigh's body symbolize the action and drama of the film while tied to the music of the Psycho shower scene. The term graphic match is very symbolic to show that life goes down the drain. To explain in the shower scene as Janet Leigh is stabbed and her body slides down with the shower curtain breaking the camera does a very close angle shot of her eye and then the camera slowly but surely makes it way to the blood and water flowing down the drain to symbolize death. This is a great example of graphic match it does exactly what it says by taking two unlike objects as in this case an eye and a drain of a tub to compare the action and drama that just unfolded in a scene with blood and water going down the drain symbolizing death while the eye open and an open drain show that life is no more. Finally enough about the famous shower scene everyone should know by now the story and technique behind it and how it was done to perfection, but I end my discussion of the scene I don't what you to think that your in a cinema history class! Hey don't forget how great a film Psycho is it has several other good reasons for it's classic ranking besides the shower scene with montage to start the intelligent directing of Alfred Hitchcock he simply was the master at keeping people in suspense and Psycho is full of suspense from start to finish. Also another interesting moment is to notice Hitchcock as the pedestrian outside the office in the very first few minutes of Psycho it was common for Alfred to make small appearances in his movies. And Anthony Perkins was great as the best and most liked Psycho character of our time the famous Norman Bates. The character had such intelligent wit and yet evil twisted means. So make reservations to the Bates Motel you will enjoy this classic of strange happenings at a rundown motel. I added this movie to my video library just this year and I recommend that anyone add Psycho to a personal movie collection of their own.

Hitchcock at his scariest,"""Psycho"", the Hitchcock masterpiece of 1960, is still a scary ride. TCM presented it on Halloween night, which was an appropriate way to add to all the horror being shown on television.As the film opens, we are treated to Saul Bass' titles that herald some of what one is expecting will come in the film. Then, one hears the magnificent opening bars of Bernard Herrmann's music score and one realizes this is not an ordinary movie. The crisp black and white cinematography by John Russell, as well as the intelligent editing by George Tomasini, surpass any doubt this was one of Alfred Hitchcock's best work. Of course, the film owes a debt to Joseph Stefano who adapted the Robert Bloch novel, in which the movie is based, with great flair.""Psycho"" works because of the wonderful cast assembled for the movie. Anthony Perkins was an actor who could play anything. His range was enormous, as he shows in the film. His Norman Bates shows a man that appears to be in complete control of himself. We watch him as he begins to unravel when confronted first by Arbogast, and then by Sam Loomis. Mr. Perkins' performance is one of the best he ever gave in his film career.Janet Leigh who plays Marion Crane is perfect as the small would be criminal who happens to be in the wrong place, at the wrong time. It's a tribute to Ms. Leigh's talent that she underplays Marion because she is battling with her own conscience as she realizes the enormity of what she has done. Alas, she was not going to make good on her resolve.The supporting cast is also interesting. Martin Balsam plays the private detective well. He is instrumental in cracking Norman's confidence, but of course, it comes with a high price he must pay for trying to shake the sick man. Vera Miles and John Gavin are seen as Marion's sister and boyfriend.""Psycho"" will remain an exercise in horror by a man who knew how to scare us, Alfred Hitchcock!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"55 Years Later And ""Psycho's"" Horror Continues","Below are 2 quotes from actor Anthony Perkins who had played the pivotal role of Norman Bates in Hitchcock's ""Psycho"". I think these quotes are sure to be of some interest to anyone who is at all familiar with this film and its legacy to the genre of horror.(1) ""Hitchcock thought of Psycho (1960) as a comedy. When it first came out, it was greeted with screams of laughter. People laughed all the way through, so much so that he declared it was the first time he had ever been out-thought by an audience. He knew it was going to be funny, but he didn't realize it was going to be that funny.""(2) ""Not many people know this, but I was in New York rehearsing for a play when the shower scene was filmed in Hollywood. It is rather strange to go through life being identified with this sequence knowing that it was my double. Actually, the first time I saw Psycho and that shower scene was at the studio."".... Well, there you have it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Cleaning Up After Mom,"During the Mid Eighties I attended a science fiction convention in Manhattan and the feature attraction there was Anthony Perkins. There was Mr. Perkins, the celebrated Norman Bates of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho among all the Trekkies and Doctor Who fans, etc. I think he looked on it as an opportunity to promote the succeeding Psycho films.Tony Perkins was clearly ill at ease among the Sci-Fi crowd. People like the Star Trek cast members know what to expect at these gatherings and act accordingly. Perkins did not really know how to handle the banter, he was in my estimation a serious guy who must have thought he was in a freak show. I asked him about appearing in Friendly Persuasion with Gary Cooper and I told him that that was my favorite role he did. He looked grateful that someone knew he did something besides Norman Bates.But for better or worse, Norman Bates became his career role and it's what we remember Anthony Perkins for. He does create an indelible impression on the screen with Alfred Hitchcock's direction as the shy mother fixated man running a flea bag motel in an area where a new super highway has taken all the potential business.Psycho has a simple plot. Janet Leigh on an impulse embezzles $40,000 in cash from her employer and goes on the run. She winds up in the Bates motel run by Norman and his mother. Later on private detective Martin Balsam goes after her as well. And finally John Gavin as Leigh's boy friend and Vera Miles as her sister go looking for the both of them.Simple enough, but Alfred Hitchcock creates a mood of terror and suspense that lingers long after you've seen the film. My favorite shot of the film is not Leigh's legendary shower stabbing, but of Martin Balsam being knocked down and falling down that flight of stairs and then being stabbed to death. The camera work showing Balsam falling backwards is the most terrifying part of Psycho.Though Anthony Perkins did so many other good things, the average cinema fan will tell you 99 out of 100 times that Norman Bates is the role he remembers Perkins for. So Perkins went with the flow.It was repetitious for him, but a treat for fans.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
film isn't as good as the novel,"When I read the novel, it really creeped me out. Not long after I watched the film and was disappointed. The only thing I liked in it were the story (which is absolutely the same as in the book), b/w cinematography and acting from Anthony Perkins. Shower scene and the scene when Bates runs in his mother's outfit were hilarious. What makes the film good is its story. Thanks to Robert Bloch, not Alfred Hitchcock! And come on, Hitchcock is overrated. Most of his films are very theatrical and acting in them is not credible. Billy Wilder and Orson Welles are much better directors, in my opinion.

You'll be frightened every time you use a motel shower.,"This is one of the most stunning movies my eyes have ever gazed upon. Anthony Perkins was electric in his performance as a deranged motel owner. I feel the direction was quite magnificent. I was amazed every time the camara pointed up the path to view the house on the hill where Norman Bates lived. The suspense was immense, at the beginning where Janet Leigh is about to steal the money and then sees her boss when she's leaving town to what would be a terrifying death.

Hitch's masterwork,"PSYCHO truly is an excellent film, a movie which, along with the same year's PEEPING TOM, managed to kick start a new genre of psychological thrillers which continues to this day. It's perfectly made, with an excellent story (thanks to the reliable schlockmeister Robert Bloch), a great script adaptation, and assured direction from Hitchcock.It's hard to know what stands out here the most: the brooding cinematography, in which features such as the Bates Motel become characters in their own right, or Anthony Perkins's most famous role. Perkins encapsulates Bates perfectly, making him a bogeyman far more frightening than the OTT fantasy creations of a Freddy Krueger or Jason Vorhees.Watching it today, it's tough to imagine sitting through it without knowing the various twists beforehand, but they must have been mind-blowing to newcomers. And one of the things I like best is that the film is already great, and thrilling, even before the action shifts to the Bates Motel. Add in a great Martin Balsam performance and you have one of the greatest masterworks of 20th century cinema, in my humble opinion.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A Classic in Every Sense of the Word,"To cinema lovers everywhere, Alfred Hitchcock was a god.  And while he may not have created the heavens and the earth, he did create something possibly more amazing: Psycho.  Hitchcock once said that he did not care about the acting so much as the technical elements of the film, but he pulled uniformly outstanding performances from Janet Leigh, Anthony Perkins, Martin Balsam, and Vera Miles.  But, as many other reviewers have noted, it was not the actors that made Psycho one of the pinnacles of cinema; it was Hitch himself.  His skillful use of lighting, effects, editing, and camera work have never been evidenced better than here.  Hitchcock's magic was that he could take such a horrific story and make it so beautiful that you the viewer are entranced by it, not able to wrest yourself away for any reason. Psycho is the only movie I've ever seen that grows scarier each time I watch.  The titles are a work of art in and of themselves, the photography is absolutely amazing, and Anthony Perkins's subtle, nuanced portrayal of Norman will almost have you rooting for him.  Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho is truly a classic in every sense of the word, and in every sense of the film to which it can be applied.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

10/10,"This movie is a classic for a reason. The lack of special effects, CGI and stuff used in movies now does not stop 'Psycho' from sending a chill down the spine. Unlike movies like 'The Exorcist' that relies on swearing, disfigured face and the infamous pea-soup vomit (which, by the way, makes the movie much less scary when watched today, but it is understandable why it was such a classic horror flick in its day) to produce its scares, 'Psycho' relies on its actors and their performance - which is why it still holds up today. There isn't a single boring or unwanted scene, and the plot is fast-paced enough to hold our attention, and at the same time, not overwhelmingly so. This is a movie that still remains a classic even though sixty-odd years have passed since its release.

After 38 years it still delivers the goods.,Alfred Hitchcock is still my favorite director and with Psycho he proved that a great director can make a great film for less than one million dollars.

"Hitchcock: ""To me Psycho was a big comedy.""","I agree with the fact that it has been of (most) importance for the movie industry because of some new elements it introduced. But besides that and the good directing, it totally lacks of brilliance. The actors were OK, but not worthy of all the praise they were given for it... Just take a look at what they have achieved in life: Anthony Perkins: 1 Oscar nomination (for supporting role), Janet Leigh: 1 Oscar nomination (for Psycho, which tells us a lot), and I won't even mention Vera Miles simply because there is nothing to mention. These are no great actors, not in any other movies, and neither in Psycho. Then we come to the story, the part of the film I really did not like. There's simply nothing brilliant about it, it's merely a plain story. Also, it was a little too obvious, referring to the fact that Norman's mother was already dead. This should have been worked out better, just like the shower scene. OK, the idea was brilliant, but I just can't believe, even back in 1960, that people find this shocking. It was such a let-down, I had expected so much more of this scene... It really looked like a big comedy. I know that many of the Psycho fans will disagree with my opinion, but let me just quote Hitchcock to add force to my opinion: ""To me Psycho was a big comedy. Had to be."" Then I wondered, how come it still has become a classic? Well, allow me to again quote Hitchcock: ""Even my failures make money and become classics a year after I make them.""",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Awesome work of art!,"Alfred Hitchcock takes over an hour and a half in his movie masterpiece, Psycho, to set up the audience for the dénouement scene, i.e. the scene in which Norman Bates' mother first reveals herself. The truth about her is so unexpected that it startles the first-time viewer into immediate and involuntary contemplation concerning the nature of the relationship between her and Norman.The first-time viewer is virtually coerced by Hitchcock to start thinking and theorizing in order to satisfy the viewer's own inherent need to make sense out of what is happening in the movie. It is reminiscent of some of William Faulkner's best work, in that it conjures up all sorts of unshown images in one's mind.The most amazing aspect of this great movie consists of its utter believability from beginning to end. These bizarre events could all really have happened! Go see this movie on the big screen. Don't talk to anyone who has seen it about its many secrets. You are best advised to discover those secrets for yourself, in due course. You will be artfully manipulated and mesmerized by the unexcelled genius of Alfred Hitchcock, in a way that is only rivaled by the likes of the great Orson Wells.If you have heart trouble, don't go to this movie.

There are hundred of thousands of reviews on this movie and almost everyone rates it high for once I feel special.,6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Very boring.,"This movie is so bad that I almost would've thought that I watched the wrong movie if it hadn't been for the opening credits. Are all these positive reviews fake? Has no one that has seen this movie also seen a good horror movie? Are people really that easily manipulated? I don't know. I'm going to try to avoid any spoilers in my review of this mess, as people seem to care about it, but honestly there is so little to this movie that there isn't really anything to spoil.The first hour of this movie is extremely boring. Everything is dragged out to pad the runtime. The entire opening scene doesn't even have anything to do with anything that happens after. Towards the middle of the movie, there is a scene in a shower that is so poorly edited and acted that it left me laughing hysterically. I'm pretty sure the scene was supposed to be scary, but honestly I can't see anyone being on the edge of their seat from a performance like that. After that scene, a detective character shows up, and he is kind of interesting, but he dies after less than 10 minutes, so it's kind of pointless. The movie remains mildly entertaining after that, but it's not amazing or anything.The main thing that makes me hate this movie is the closing scene. The truth about the villain is revealed in an exposition dump that lasts like 5-10 minutes. The reason why I don't like it is because this could've been a very interesting plot point that could've been developed over the course of the movie, but is instead just relegated to a plot twist. If we had spent the movie following a villain like that, it would've been really interesting, or maybe even scary. You could say that they didn't do this because they were focusing on the victims, but this movie has no character development. No one grows over the course of the movie, and you don't learn about the personalities or backstories of pretty much anyone.The filmmaking is ok. It's competant. Nothing special. The only interesting shot that stands out is one around a staircase. That's it.Overall, this is a really boring, pointless, and meandering movie with a wasted concept. The only reason why anyone is praising this is because people like Alfred Hitchcock. Or they're just easily scared? I don't know. I really don't recommend watching this one.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Far better when I saw it on the big screen.,"I was fortunate that the local film society had a viewing of PSYCHO on the big screen. I'd seen it on TV a couple times...I liked it but didn't love it.

It still isn't quite as good as the cinematography in THE THIRD MAN...but it is close!While I could summarize the film and write a lengthy review about what I liked, I won't. After all, there are over 1600 reviews! But I did think it's about as good a Hitchcock film as you'll ever find.By the way, if you like the film, try finding PEEPING TOM.

My favorite film!!!,"Although it is extremely difficult to pick a single film as one's favorite, this would be my pick if I were forced to choose.  No, it is not because it is the most shocking or original film ever made (as if there could be).  In 40 years, the film has lost much of what made it revolutionary in 1960.  It is simply a fantastic screenplay that keeps me on the edge of my seat at all times.This is Hitchcock's best work as a director in my opinion.  Though he rarely made a bad film, most of Hitch's films are commercially-directed. I think of North By Northwest, Suspicion, Notorious and The Man Who Knew Too Much as examples.  Though each is a fantastic film, they are not terribly stimulating too watch and have minimal artistic merit.  Psycho, by contrast, is a true work of art.  No one could have expected it to be a hit at the time and was a great departure from Hitch's 1950s films.  There are no Cary Grants or Jimmy Stewarts here.  Just minor stars like Anthony Perkins and Martin Balsam.The two aspects of Psycho that set it apart are its cinematography and score.  There are no panoramic views typical of great cinematographic works. In fact, the whole film has the feel of a B movie.  One need only watch the famous shower scene to understand what I am talking about.  It is perhaps the most breathtaking 2 minutes ever put to film.  Hitch's close up shot of Marion's eye is still jolting today.  Imagine watching the scene on the big screen in 1960!  I guess what truly sets this film apart is the score. Perhaps no film is as tied to its score.  Bernard Herrmann may be the best there ever was at his profession.  His scores for Vertigo and Marnie are also top notch.Just watch this film.  If you've never seen it, it will provide a unique and surprising experience.  If you've already seen it, watch it again and enjoy Hitch at his best!  If you love Psycho as I do, check out Polanski's Repulsion, the French film Diabolique, and Hitch's first talkie Blackmail.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Exasperatingly detailed, steely-cold precursor to the 'slasher'...","Alfred Hitchcock has no sympathy for the victims in ""Psycho"", and he views them dispassionately. This relatively low-budget film is in silvery black-and-white, eerie and beautiful, with gliding camera-work and clever production touches which warrant repeat viewings, however it is much too merciless towards its characters to be a black comedy. It's also not much of a murder-mystery (we have an early idea of what's going on), yet the suspense in the third act is mounted with cunning precision. Mostly, Hitchcock seems curiously fascinated with plot-exposition and details, although the picture is still quite chilling. Anthony Perkins' tightly-controlled performance as Norman Bates is hypnotizing: his boyish good looks can be taken either way--gangly or crazily disconnected--and his eyes, which are frantic, dart around like an impatient child's (it's the role of a lifetime). I didn't much care for Simon Oakland's psychology report at the end, but the final shots and the voice-over are masterfully pulled-off. *** from ****",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A mind is a terrible thing to lose,"The psychological threads of the film are so complex as to be nearly inexhaustible; this feature alone contributes to its place in film history as one of the great celluloid efforts of all time. Like any genuine work of true genius, it may be enjoyed on more than one level. Alfred Hitchcock forced film-goers to confront head-on just a few of the shadowy corners of the human psyche: the Oedipus/Elektra complexes, jealousy about sexual [or perceived sexual] rights, guilt, and self-hatred [as in Norman's cross-dresssing], to cite just a few examples of neurotic behavior. Perhaps the most frightening interpretation of the film is that one is responsible for one's actions and cannot, ever, alter the designated course a particular act has set in motion. Here, it is Marion Crane's decision to steal the $40 grand from her employer in order to race to Fairvale to be with her [illicit] lover, Sam Loomis. The opening vista, a bleak mountain and desert landscape over Phoenix [note the metaphor for both the geographical location and the town's name], is replete with the futility of the lovers ever forging a permanent bond with one another. The film is a terrific essay of human desperation and its stray threads: the hunger for sex, for a safe haven, for an ascendant place in one's tiny universe. The barrenness of the emotional landscape is shiveringly mirrored in Bernard Herrmann's shrill, spiky score, which speaks of the desolation of all humankind. Both murders are violent acts of mutilation and hatred, one thinks, not only for the victims, but also for the perpetrator. Fittingly, the killer's ""cleansing"" ritual takes place in a swamp, the normal repository for all kinds of secrets and unclean, dangerous organisms lurking beneath the stagnant surface. Finally, I found most interesting the title on the record label on the turntable in Norman's room: Beethoven's Eroica Symphony [No. 3]. This majestic, noble work bears no resemblance to the music one would justly associate with the tormented mind of young Bates. One can only guess that the boy's impressionable mind was at one time quite normal and receptive to elevated experiences such as a hearing of this great work of Beethoven's, but that jealousy, perhaps having been spurred by an intimacy with his mother, drove the boy to madness. Guilt, one of the human being's great purgatives, finds no outlet here, as we see in Norman's feral smile at the film's end. Hitchcock's use of mirrors works wonderful psychological tricks upon us, forcing us to wonder if what we see in our real and fancied mirrors, is real.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Psycho,  The most overrated horror.. NO suspense movie of all time.","Well,   what can I say about this film.   It's merely okay and the black and white makes the film seem completely dull and frankly quite boring.  I don't understand what all this talk about the color being artistic but I found it repulsive.   The acting in the movie was very mediocre, especially from the stiff John Gavin,   the ever so proper Vera Miles,  and the so serious Martin Balsam.   Try watching the new Psycho and you'll find that these characters can actually have personalities. As for Janet Leigh, well she was good,   but Anne Heche seemed more innocent,  more human,  and more sympathetic.   As for Anthony Perkins,    he's also so monotone, barely ANY emotion,   and I struggle to understand why people rave over his dry performance.  As for the ""mother twist"",  well that was good but there are twists in about every horror film now a days and they are usually more entertaining than this joke. And then there is the shower scene which everyone says is so scary?  Where have they been ,  I could pick out a dream sequence from any A Nightmare on Elm Street sequel that was done more creatively and powerfully.  It was a simple knifing in the shower for god's sake,   isn't watching the opening of Drew Barrymore in Scream ten times more chilling and exciting? Give me a break,  when I went to Universal Studious they said the shower sequence was one of the most famous scenes of all time.  Well,  give an audience an opportunity to watch either that or the astonishing death of Piper Laurie in Depalma's Carrie,  or the thrill of the finale chase in Halloween,  and well see what brings more reactionary emotion of the audience.  Well,  what can I say about a movie that I will never understand?  When people made the new Psycho some thought it was stupid because of the story--and so I know I'm not alone.   It's just that these old foggies are so hung up on old movies that they are blind to see that modern movies provide for much more entertainment.    Some old horror films like Rosemary's Baby are excellent,  but this is not.  As for Bernard Herrmann score,   it's overplayed,   can't he think of anything new to compose? Compare Pino Donnagio' lush score from Carrie opposed to this and see what's more creative and effective.  What can I say besides people, this movie is simply average and that it might of have been good back then, but it's simply OK now.  Do we still rave about the type writer just because it was original back then?  I have spoken and I guess that Blockbuster Video agrees with me that the movie is too much of a joke to be placed in the horror section.  It's in the Drama suspense category,  and certainly a thrilless and dated film to belong anywhere else.  Psycho remains as the most overrated film of all time and the new Psycho is a much better improvement.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

And forget about the famous (and too much copied) shower scene, or the detective's murder; the most horrifying scene is the one at the end where Norman Bates sits alone, thinking  his mother's  thoughts, and then gives to the camera THAT look- it has me scared sh**less every time I see it.

This is one to watch again and again.,"Alfred Hitchcock's crisp efficiency is not unlike that of Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), the dutiful son who cleans up after his mother in the landmark thriller ""Psycho.""  Not only is this a masterfully directed suspense chiller, it actually set standards by which all fright films since have been measured.  The cinema has produced some great scores, but Bernard Herrmann's music is incredibly enhancing and simply unforgettable, one of the best ever (and it did not even get an Oscar nomination for Best Score). The more I watch ""Psycho,"" the more I prefer the first half, with its sense of dread and a fascinatingly cool Janet Leigh (Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress). Hitchcock, of course, never won the Best Director Oscar, but was nominated for ""Psycho,"" one of 1960's biggest box-office hits.  Shockingly, Anthony Perkins, in a career-making role and one of the most famous performances in screen history, failed to win a Best Actor nomination -- probably because the performance was too edgy and disturbing (which is what made it great).  Some scenes are dated, of course, but this film almost never falters.  It gets a ""9"" (and a very high nine at that) from me.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I guess it's never too late to thrown in your own love and admiration for a classic film...,"I have to admit that I have a terrible habit of getting around to watching classic movies when it's really late in the game. I guess my excuse is that I'm only 23, and most of the so-called ""classic"" movies of the 20th century were made well before I was even born. I'm ashamed to say that I fell in love with both ""Jaws"" (1975) and ""Halloween"" (1978) just last year; this year, just about a half-hour ago, I had the great pleasure to see Alfred Hitchcock's classic 1960 suspense-thriller ""Psycho.""A lot has already been said about this film, so I won't comment too much on what it's actually about, and instead I'll only comment on significance and my reactions to it. ""Psycho"" has a plot based heavily in reality: adapted from the novel of the same name by Robert Bloch, the book and film were loosely based on the crimes of real-life Wisconsin serial killer Ed Gein. ""Psycho"" finds its story revolving around Marion Crane (the late Janet Leigh), a lowly Phoenix, Arizona, secretary who embezzles $40,000 from her boss and hits the road, later stopping in at the isolated Bates Motel, and meets the owner and sole employee of the establishment, Norman Bates (the late Anthony Perkins).The rest of the plot is well-known to anyone who has seen the film, so I won't describe it. Plus, to really describe the rest of the plot in any sort of detail at all will ruin the shocks and surprises that the film has in store for the viewer (most notoriously, the infamous ""shower scene,"" which has to be seen to be believed, and experienced). The ""shower scene"" itself is one of the chief reasons to see this picture; it's shocking, Bernard Herrmann's theme slices away at your eardrums, and it's one of the iconic death scenes - one of the most iconic scenes, period - in movie history.""Psycho"" is a phenomenal piece of film, from a master filmmaker and an equally talented cast and crew; it's a true cinematic landmark. Most importantly, and the reason why I now hold this film to the high degree that I do now, is that ""Psycho"" is partially (or is it entirely?) responsible for influencing entire generations of filmmakers, particularly those in the horror genre. ""Psycho"" has almost single-handedly influenced, and given rise to, the slasher sub-genre of horror, which of course gave rise to, and is populated by the likes of, Leatherface (from ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" series), Michael Myers (from the ""Halloween"" series), Jason Voorhees (from the ""Friday the 13th"" series), my personal favorite movie slasher Fred Krueger (from the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" series), and countless other imitators. ""Psycho"" would itself become fodder for the slasher genre nearly two decades after its release, when it was followed up by three vastly inferior sequels, with Anthony Perkins reprising his signature role as Norman Bates in all three films.""Psycho"" has also been the subject of a lot of psychiatric and psychological analysis, for those interested in understanding the criminal mind and how it functions. As a criminal justice major in college, in my studies I've across several opportunities to study ""Psycho"" (but never did) and exactly how it influenced the slasher genre and why it's fascinated criminology experts in the decades since its release, thus having even greater influence outside of the film community and American pop culture.Alfred Hitchcock proved that he was a cinematic genius with ""Psycho,"" since I understand that it is arguably his best and most popular film. At least now I've finally had a chance to see a movie that I've heard so much about and never previously got the chance to watch.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Hitchcock is the most-daring avant-garde film-maker in America today,"A seminal classic of horror by master Alfred Hitchcock, with some of the most memorable iconic scenes in the history of Cinema. Tense, horrific and a superb lesson in filmmaking, it offers well-constructed characters, a lot of revealing dialogue and a huge regard for details.
Hitchcock's classic ""comedy"" featuring the world's most famous mother's boy is one of the most influential films ever made; every serial killer and slasher movie owes something to this, one of the true greats of cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Great Cinematic Poem,"The strings of Bernard Herrmann combined with the screams of Janet Leigh, the knife of Norman Bates and the cuts of Alfred Hitchcock makes the movie moment that penetrated pop culture like no other.My impression is that Psycho is perceived as purely a great piece of craft and entertainment, but in my mind what makes Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho such a singular work is the deep and personal poetry it contains.Hitchcock was completely fearless in his ideas at this point. He makes his most radical and innovative film. The movie is heightened from his famous thrillers to a pure and modern horror movie. The visual universe is now dirty and grim as opposed to beautiful and glamorized. The icy and sophisticated blonds are gone and there are no traces of sympathetic heroes.Everyone who has seen an interview with Alfred Hitchcock knows that he hides behind an inflated and parodic character. In his interviews he is very secretive and doesn't revel anything about himself. The opposite is true in his films. In his movies he is often completely open and naked. He exposes the most shameful truths about himself and his life. In Psycho he does a personal examination on a level beyond anything I've ever seen. He puts himself in the space where he is the most vulnerable. He offers a ""peeping hole"" into the darkest corners of his personality. The movie is extremely revealing, but in very subtle ways. One has to work to find the treasures of Psycho.Psycho is like a novel in the way images are often suggested and has to be completed in the heads of the audience. The sexual and violent scenes are never explicit. This makes the movie even more disturbing than it ever could be if we had seen the images, and this was also the only way Hitchcock could convey what he wanted to convey and still get past the ridiculously strict American censorship laws of the time.Sexuality is always a theme in a Hitchcock movie, but he never explored it as profoundly or intimately as he did in Psycho. The shower scene for example feels like a rape as much as it does a murder(the feeling intrusion, the nakedness and so on). Norman desperately desires Marion Crane. He is sexually satisfied by killing her(it might be a stretch, but I see the knife as a symbol of the male sex organ). This scene is all about the childish shame of Normans sexuality. Norman, or the mother side of him, tries to suppress his sexuality completely. This is one of the examples of the openness of Hitchcock in this movie. His catholic upbringing would suggest a lot of shameful sexuality in his life as well. Something he has in common with his biggest contemporary director hero, Luis Bunuel. Bunuel are one of very few directors who explored his own sexuality with anything close to the amount of honesty of Psycho.Psycho is such a rich movie. It is filled with details. I believe you could watch it fifty times over and still find something new the fifty first time you watch it. Pay for example attention to all the little symbols and metaphors scatterd all over every single frame. Notice all the fascinations or ""fetishes"" of Hitchcocks that he put into it. The stuffed birds and the way they mirror Normans mother. The way food and eating connects with murder and sex. The peeping hole as a symbol for voyeurism and the movie camera. The cellar as a symbol of the suppressed and the shameful truths about Norman Bates. I really want to go into all these details, but like I said, there are too many and too much to discuss. It wont fit into the format of an IMDb review...If you don't see the same things I do in this movie, please watch it again. Even more than the magnificent ""Vertigo"" Psycho has the ability to grow immensely on a second viewing, and continue to grow on the third, fourth, fifth, sixth... In my heart it has grown to be one of the absolute best films in movie history.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Anthony Perkins,"WOW. I'd heard a lot (like all of us, probably) about this movie but I hadn't actually watched until last night.Anthony Perkins' performance was so good!His face transformed so many times.He looks both like a nice boy and a scary one. His nervous ticks and air of sweetness and menace! *clapping*.The fact that Perkins could never escape this role proves that he played the part perhaps too well.And that ending, I wasn't expecting that! Marvellous.This is my first review, I'm sorry if I made a mistake!",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Too unconvincing to be true,"I never was a great Hitchcock fan and this movie did nothing to change my mind. It's indisputable that he makes very good movies from the formal-technical point of view and that he knows how to create a suspense and (or) horror atmosphere with great mastery and skillfulness but the stories he tells us are too fanciful to be real (despite the fact that they are presented as real)and when he dives into the psychological pathology of his characters he becomes much unconvincing. For instance in this movie the psychiatrist's explanation which takes place in the final scene doesn't seem to me to have great scientific rigor, looking more like pure fantasy. Nevertheless it's true indeed that this movie (like others he has made) keeps us stuck to our seats and wrapped up in the story unfolding from the first to the last scene. Only later and after the movie ends do we emerge from that spell to realize that all that has very little juice in terms of psychological reality. This movie has however also a remarkable feature in the performance of the great actor who is Anthony Perkins who makes and excellent character very well adapted to the role that the movie's director gave him and with great and talented sobriety.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A Chilling Classic.,"The first time I saw Psycho, I watched the first 20 minutes and stopped the tape. I thought it was boring. But, alas, I rented it again a few weeks ago and I didn't like it. Didn't like it at all. I bloody loved it! Psycho is a freakin' masterpiece! It is easily Alfred Hitchcock's best film, and it is definitely an unforgettable chilling classic. Anthony Perkins was brilliant as Norman Bates, I will certainly look out for more of his work in the coming months. Janet Leigh was also very impressive, she was a real gem of Psycho.So, don't make the same mistake I did, watch this classic today, and I guarantee you'll never forget it.Rating: 10",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Greatest Film of all Time,"Films like Psycho should be remembered throughout history.  A work of technical and psychological brilliance, I am stunned that someone could find this film boring and not frightening.  This was undoubtedly the scariest movie ever made.  Only Hitchcock could make this film a classic. With only two murders, it is infinitely scarier than any of these slasher films with a murder every two seconds.  This movie was not about the murders, although that was what you were lead to believe by the first murder.  This film was, for lack of a better term, a horrifying character study.  This film will go down in history and be remembered forever for it.  It should never have been remade, and one can only hope that perhaps someday they will re-release it into theaters.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Hitchcock the master salesman,"Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) steals $40k from work, and runs away. In a stormy night, she stops at the isolated Bates Motel where she meets creepy Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins).This one has Alfred Hitchcock as the master salesman. It's the biggest show in show business, and he's the master of ceremony. He pulls out all the stops like the secrecy and the refusal of entry to late arrivals. It helps to have the most iconic movie scene of all times.Janet Leigh isn't just a damsel in distress or a shrinking violet. She is a woman with a dark side. The fact that she's an A-list star used to mean that she'll last until the end of the movie. When the super creepy Anthony Perkins joins her, it was set up for a prolong creepfest. Then comes the most well made important scene in history. The second half does have a little struggle to reclimb that peak, and I didn't like all the pontificating at the end. But those are tiny problems in a great movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The one thing that was really intriguing was the character of Norman Bates, who would make an interesting study in probably any field.

"""A Standard Rave""","Strange what the passage of time can do to a film. I remember seeing portions of ""Psycho"" when I was very young on local TV; when our household became cable-ready a few years later and AMC showed actual movie classics, Hitchcock's film was regular on the rotation. I remember being shocked and impressed by Janet Leigh's shower demise and Martin Balsam's staircase tumble, but not too wild about the actual narrative. When you're less than 10 years old, you take for granted a lot of the nuances of film-making that only make sense when you're older.And ""Psycho"" is almost entirely nuance and technique. From Anthony Perkins' legendary performance as the quiver-lipped, boyish Norman Bates to Bernard Herrmann's piercingly authorative, all-strings score to Hitchcock's intersection of characters (where misunderstandings and misplaced responsibility are the norm), the film is a masterful blend of all the elements that make for quality cinema. And for all its pop-culture influence (as it was one of the first 'psychological horrors' put on screen), ""Psycho"" remains extremely subtle and surprising, even if you know all the plot turns in advance.See Marion. See Marion embezzle $44 grand from her boss. See Marion on the run from her own guilt. See Marion make a fateful stop at the Bates Motel. See Norman. See Norman talk about his abusive, domineering mother... (I needn't go any further.)Since there is really no creative way to write about a film that has already been so extensively written on, I offer some of my personal favorite moments: The head-on shots of Marion (Janet Leigh) driving away from responsibility, listening to dialogues taking place far away, her facial expressions our only indicator of emotion. The judgmental look of the used-car salesman. The way Norman leans his head forward in the parlor, becoming somber and defensive over the word 'someplace.' The shriek of strings as the shower curtain is pulled back. Norman's awkward reaction to Private Investigator Arbogast (Martin Balsam)'s casual questioning. Arbogast's oblivious, seemingly slow-motion ascent of the staircase. Mrs. Bates' closing monologue, delivered in an acrid voice whose tone will literally make your skin crawl.And there's a lot more. As much as it's been said already, I will have to concur that ""Psycho"" is probably Hitchcock's masterpiece (I haven't seen all of his films), a near-seamless blend of story, character, irony, and technique.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Probably, the most terrific thriller made. A film that terrifies even 50 years after it's made.","Probably, the most terrific thriller made. A film that terrifies even 50 years after it's made.To pigeonhole this as a thriller would be wrong as per me. It has a murder mystery, a psychological thriller, a huge amount of drama, and even a family backdrop. With all such elements, it would be wrong if I were to categorize this as merely a thriller. Yes, it is filled with thrills and for the 110 minutes of running time, there is hardly any dull moment.I have seen this movie, a number of times before and each time it had a terrific impact. Also, I have always found something new, maybe a new frame, new shot or a new background sound. The discovery does not seem to stop. This I attribute to the many elements that are involved in this film.From placing the camera, composing the shot, revealing the right emotion and making the audiences wait till the shocking aspect is revealed, Hitchcock is at his best in this film. This is indeed one of the more simpler stories he dealt. Yet, he made it so impact full that it continues to surprise audiences even today. Thanks to the music by Bernard Hermann, whose contribution to the film is very important. I cannot imagine this film without the music and I believe that it's because of the music, that the resonance was acquired.If it's the shower scene that is most talked about in this film, I believe there are couple or more scenes that are under rated yet very impact full. Now, I do not want to reveal those and give away some details. I can simply say, I was terrified by the climax shot where the mother is shown, more than anything else.The cast is perfect equally, Anthony Perkins does a wonderful job as Norman Bates. He is cold blooded and yet looks so deceptively humane as an extremely caring human. This film and ""The Trial"" are perhaps the most important films in his career.It is the first psychological thriller of it's kind as I read in various other sites and perhaps it is also the most violent films made. Though the violence comes for less than 10 minutes, it haunts so brutally, as if it was there all through the film.It's a definite 5/5 for one of the finest films of all time by one of the greatest directors.http://braddugg.blogspot.in/",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Works because of the performances,"Reviewing Alfred Hitchcock's famed black and white opus Psycho from a 21st century perspective gives the film less credit than it deserves. For it's time, it was revolutionary. Now, it is just a well acted, yet somewhat dated horror film. The editing in the shower scene has become a cliché in pop culture, but one cannot deny the original brilliance of the scene. The movie really only works as well as it does because of the performances of Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins. Perkins never really had another role he was better in, save Mike Nichols' Catch-22, a personal favorite. After Hitchcock died, he later starred and directed in numerous Psycho sequels before Perkins' eventual death. Hitchcock's killing of Leigh at the onset is also quite ground-breaking. It was mirrored in Wes Craven's Scream with the Drew Barrymore character, as well as in many other pictures.Psycho also created the character of Dr. Sam Loomis, a name later used in the other revolutionary horror film, John Carpenter's Halloween. Overall, the movie doesn't age as horrible as some other select black and white 50's-60's horror films, but nevertheless it does age a reasonable amount, leading to many cringe worthy and laughable scenes, most likely due lackluster performances by the rest of the cast, low production values, and shady effects and ""skeletons.""",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"""A Psychiatrist Doesn't Lay The Groundwork ... He Merely Tries To Explain It.""","A respectable 30-year-old spinster steals $40,000 from her workplace and takes off on a solo car journey to nowhere.  She makes the fateful mistake of staying overnight at the Bates Motel ...There is a difference between a great film, where the cast and technicians seem inspired and the project is carried along on the energy of its ideas, and a merely good film, in which the cleverness is calculated, and the tricks are consciously inserted.  ""Psycho"" is merely a good film.But what cleverness!  The incidental music of Bernard Herrman, Hitchcock's composer of choice, has a discordant, staccato leitmotif in the strings which repeats constantly, building almost hypnotically towards the shrill climax of the shower scene.  Hitchcock deploys a battery of subtle devices to keep the viewer feeling vaguely uneasy.  Sexual frankness was a shocking thing in a mainstream movie in 1960, and the opening scene (showing Marion's ""extended lunch hour"" with Sam) is so sexually honest that it cannot have failed to disturb contemporary cinema audiences.  Faces are lit from below or the side, creating an inchoate sense of foreboding.  Owls and ravens, traditional omens of evil, preside silently over Norman's parlour. The windshield wiper which fails to clear the rain is a symbol of Marion's guilty conscience.The film's abiding mood is one of creepy uneasiness, and this is reinforced at every turn by Hitchcock's system of visual imagery.  There is, of course, the Old Dark House, but far less obvious techniques are also at work.  As Arbogast mounts the stairs, the camera retreats disconcertingly before him.  The tines of the rakes in Sam's store are raised like bony, clutching fingers behind Lila's head.  Marion's unblinking eyeball is compositionally echoed by the circular plughole, the water draining out as her life force ebbs away.In the long dialogue scene between Norman and Marion (""We all go a little mad sometimes""), the rhythm of the cutting is exquisite.  Sometimes we see the speaker, sometimes the listener, as the rapidity of the cuts forms a counterpoint to the text, and emphasises the discomfort of the characters (Marion wary but self-possessed, Norman outwardly affable but painfully shy).The cinematic axiom, ""Show it, don't tell it"", is beautifully illustrated in the scene in Marion's bedroom.  The camera closes in on the bundles of banknotes lying on the bed, then pans to the packed suitcase, telling us without the need for words that she has decided to take the money and run.Then something puzzling happens.  The film seems to lose all belief in its own precepts, and the rich visual symbolism is abruptly abandoned.  Lila opines, ""I'll feel better when all this is explained,"" but she is wrong. The explanation is a huge let-down.  We get Dr. Simon, a psychiatrist, lecturing us at tedious length about Norman's condition.  ""Show it, don't tell it"" flies out of the window.  Maybe Stefano, the scriptwriter, realised that the running time was already over two hours and the thing needed its loose ends tied up rapidly.  Perhaps the flat, prosaic ending is the price Hitch has to pay for the slow painstaking build-up in the early reels (it is almost half an hour before Norman makes it onto the screen).  Whatever the reason, I for one found the closing section very disappointing.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
a masterpiece of audience manipulation,"Psycho is one of the great movies because of the way it manipulates the audience.

""" I think I must have one of those faces you can't help believing.""","Another favorite. I'm pretty sure this film is to blame for my early and unending love of thrillers and horror films (only the good ones though). As usual, the photography is my favorite part, as well as the editing, since both aid each other extremely well. I'm not even going to touch the shower scene, that's been analyzed to death (but I do love it). My favorite part of the photography is when she's asleep in the car, and the cop comes and talks to her through the window. The close ups in that scene are amazing. A+ acting too, perfect amount of tension. I also like when she's driving and all the bright lights are blinding her from the other side of the road. I'm so pleased they decided to film this is b&w.There are a couple other things I'd like to mention too. First, this film totally flaunts the code, right from the opening scene. I normally wouldn't have noticed it as a casual viewer but bearing in mind film history, this is the beginning of the end of the code (finally!). Second, the score is absolutely brilliant. About 90% of my music collection is film scores and I've been a fan of Bernard Herrmann since realizing he did a great number of soundtracks for Hitchcock films (North by Northwest is great, and some non Hitchcock films like Mysterious Island are good too).

My favourite film of all time!,"By far the greatest work of The Master of Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. When I watched this film for the first time aged 16, I was sucked in by the plot, the characters, Bernard Herrmann's score and the terrific acting. I went in knowing one thing about the movie, and that was that there is a shower scene. It was the first Hitchcock film I'd ever seen and it was the first mystery/thriller I'd ever seen. Now I am a big fan of both Hitch and the genre.The best aspect of this movie is the fantastic acting. What can you say that hasn't already been said about the performance of Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates except that it's a tragedy he wasn't nominated for an Oscar. His delivering of the script, his shyness and sudden twists is one of the best acting performances I've witnessed. But that doesn't take away from the rest of the cast. Janet Leigh is wonderful as Marion Crane, and supporting talent from John Gavin, Martin Balsam and especially Vera Miles, make for a film you can watch over and over.This is the first film I ever saw where afterwards, I wanted to know everything there was to know about it. I watched all the making of documentaries I could find, I wanted to watch all the sequels (Psycho II is also very good by the way) and I even chose the film as my specialist subject in a quiz we did in my college.I recommend this film to everyone. It's full of twists, turns and surprises that keep you guessing right until the end, and I mean the very end. You can't take your eyes of the screen.

Colour films had been around for quite some time when the film was made. Hitchcock decided to make it in Black and White for a reasion. You have to agree that it makes the film very scary.

Incomparable,"The plot of Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film ""Psycho"" is by now the stuff of legend; Marion Crane (Leigh), a secretary in Phoenix is desperate to marry her boyfriend Sam (Gavin), only Sam is still paying off debts from his previous marriage. One Friday a man comes into her real estate office with $40,000 in cash to purchase a house for his daughter. Instead of taking the money to the bank as her boss directed, Marion packs her bags and leaves town with the money, presumably to give to Sam so they can finally make a life together. After driving for a day and a half, she ends up stopping at a motel only 10 miles from Sam's home. The Bates Motel, operated by one Norman Bates (Perkins) is a creepy place shrouded with mystery, particularly the mystery that is Norman's mother, a driving force that looms over the property and controls Norman himself. When Marion does not show up for work on Monday, her sister Lila (Miles) comes looking for her as well as a detective, Arbogast (Balsam) hired by Marion's employer. Unfortunately they all find that as one mystery begins to unravel, another one, more quizzical and shocking is ready to take its place, and none of them are safe from the danger of the Bates Motel.I'm pretty sure that there isn't much more to say about this film that hasn't already been said; ""Psycho"" being one of the most studied and analyzed films in film history. (I myself took a class in college that examined parts of the film frame by frame, and have read books analyzing the film) However, I have to wonder if the sensation of the film and the fact that it is an instant classic, regardless if someone has seen it or not (truthfully, I have heard people say, ""Oh, that is such a classic."" And then later admit that they haven't yet seen the film at all.), sometimes waters down its mastery and the impact this film had (and continues to have) on the film industry as a whole. If you ever get the opportunity to see the art exhibit ""24 Hour Psycho"", wherein the artist slows the film down to make the running time span an entire day, or if you were to read the excellent book Shower Scene in Hitchcock's Psycho: Creating Cinematic Suspense and Terror by Philip J. Skerry, you can see how incredibly impeccable each frame of the film is. If you were to lay out any scene in the film and look at it frame by frame, you would have some incredibly compelling photographs, and that was exactly how Hitchcock intended his presentation to be.Aside from being a work of art, it is well known that ""Psycho"" changed the way that moviegoers attended the cinema. Because of the big event that occurs halfway through the film, Hitchcock could not have people continuing their normal practice of strolling into the theater whenever they felt like it. If any of these people came to see a Janet Leigh picture, they would be pretty confused at that point. So Hitchcock, ever the showman (and his own greatest publicist) announced that no one would be admitted into the theater after the movie began. This was HUGE for its time. Besides changing the attendance factor, it was one of the greatest publicity stunts of its time. If people weren't going to go to the film before, they sure were going to check it out now. I'm sure that ""Psycho"" doesn't have as much of an impact to people who grew up on slasher films or other horror films, but despite the fact it was released 45 years ago, its secrets are now the stuff of general film knowledge, and personally, the fact that I have studied it clinically, when I went to see it at the classic movie house two weeks ago, I still found that my heart was racing and the hair was standing up on my arms during the very last scene of the film. Even more of a testimony to its impact is the fact that a friend that I attended the film with, who isn't much of a film fan, much less a classic film buff not only said that he was so tense during the film that he was on pins and needles, but that he wanted to see it again, and soon. Why does this film have such a forceful impact nearly five decades after it was first released? I'm sure that one of the several hundred books written about this film and Hitchcock's filmography could give you several reasons at length. But a simple answer may sum it up best for now: It's simply a damn good movie. 9/10--Shelly",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Ordinary and mundane meets extraordinary and insane,"A day in the life of Marion Crane is expertly documented. Note every detail, every nuance, everywhere. Marion' morning is humdrum. Everything then changes - in an impulsive decision. Then, the game of consequence begins and ends in a living nightmare. Yet, Hitch manages to distort time and reality.

Masterful,"Where do you even begin with a film like Psycho. Everything about it is so masterfully done that there is very little that can be said. In addition, anything that could be said has already been said by others. Regardless, I will now tell you how I feel about Psycho and why I think that it is one of the best movies I have ever seen.Where this movie really shines, is in building tension. Not a single scene or moment goes by where you aren't kept wondering what's going to happen and how it's going to happen. As soon as Marion leaves in her car, the tension starts to build. And not until the words, 'The End', appear on the screen, does that tension ease. There are, of course, stand out scenes, such as the infamous shower scene, or the staircase scene with Arbogast. However, what to me is even more impressive, is Hitchcock's ability to keep the viewer on the edge of the seat for the entire run time.Everything about this film is simply sublime. The music, the sound effects, the acting (especially Anthony Perkins as Bates), the locations, and perhaps most importantly, the pacing. The steady stream of clues and new mysteries keep you guessing throughout the film, making sure that there isn't a dull moment.If you haven't seen Psycho already, make sure you do. It is one of those rare films where I can't think of anything to change or add. And to be completely honest with you, I believe, as do many others, that this is one of the finest pieces of cinema ever created.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A woman tries to attain money but ends up in a bad situation.,"For a black and white film, this was extremely well done. The lighting and contrast was perfect and really set the mood for a good film. It wasn't too bright or too dark and it outlined characters faces and the blood during the ""violent"" scenes. The camera was great when shooting at different angles. Especially in dramatic scenes, the camera would focus in and out of the scenes to add more flare to the subject and take long shots. I felt like the meaning behind the movie wasn't that strong because it was just a ""horror"" film. Behind it, though, there was definitely a hint of mistrust and deceit. It kind of showed that psychos are everywhere , no matter where you go and that you should be very careful in going to new places and with strangers because they could not be who they say they are.

One of the Best from One of the Best,"""Psycho"" is a masterpiece of both filmmaking and storytelling, and it's also probably one of the most influential films ever made (no hyperbole needed). While Alfred Hitchcock's career is stuffed to the gills with thrilling, horrific stories (""Frenzy"", ""The Birds"") and intriguing mysteries (""Vertigo"", ""Rope""), this film is sort of the best of both worlds; it starts off as one thing and morphs into something entirely different. ""Psycho"" has some of the best subversions of expectations I've seen brought to screen, and that's only looking at this movie from a storytelling standpoint; from a filmmaking standpoint, this film is a technical marvel, and that infamous shower scene is to this day being touted as one of the best edited minutes of cinema history (if you've got the time, check out the documentary ""78/52""- about the seventy-eight setups and fifty-two cuts used in the scene).

Not that it isn't great, maybe I'm one of those 1 out of 100 people not to be fazed by this film. As the title of the film suggest, I anticipated the twist and it the part which is supposed to 'blow your mind' was way too predictable for me. But top notch direction again.

"good direction, paved the way for modern slashers, low production values","This is a well directed and extremely well-scored movie. Unfortunately, while the movie is interesting for its place in cinematic history, (just look at the accelerated editing in the shower scene) it really isn't at all scary, or even all that interesting today. The production values for the movie are amazingly low, and it often shows (it was filmed on the cheap on a hitchcock presents TV lot). The script is weak and reeks of an exploitation film. The acting is good, though not great. Bad material handled by a great director that's worth watching if youre interested in cinema or too old to enjoy a gory, though better film.

Psychoanalysis: Peek Beyond the Curtain to Discover a Cinematic Landmark,"""Well, a son is a poor substitute for a lover.""Have to bump this one up to 5 stars. After this rewatch, as part of my ongoing Hitchcock marathon, I can now confidently say that Psycho is my favorite film of the master and that it sits firmly in my top 20 films of all time. The number of memorable quotes, indelible images and iconic scenes is quite frankly insane (wink, wink), and yet, Psycho amounts to more than the sum of its exquisite parts.There really is no other film like it, from the unique way it is structured, to its visual inventiveness, and the complex psychology of it. Indeed, Psycho's bold and successful experimentation when it comes to both the arts of storytelling and filmmaking must be applauded. However, this is not just an ""important"" film, merely a piece of academia to be studied by film scholars. The reason these creative visual techniques and the revolutionary story structure are still studied after all these years is, after all, because THEY WORK. So even if you don't care about actively analyzing Hitchcock's technical and narrative innovations, Psycho will still take you on a cinematic joyride, as it is just an utterly engrossing and immensely entertaining film.The synopsis of the film: Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) embezzles 40k from a rich client at the bank where she works and subsequently goes on the run with it. This is, of course, the greatest red herring in the history of cinema. Everything that's going on with the cop following her and the used car salesman, then the storm hitting, checking in at the Bates Motel and Marion's drawn-out conversation with Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), which then seems to make her change her mind. Through this meticulous, slow build-up, Hitchcock demands our full investment in Marion's predicament, but of course, none of that matters anymore after THE SCENE.The shower scene in Psycho. Probably one of the most well-known (and most referenced) scenes in film history, and I got nothing to add. The screeching violins and the quick editing, conspiring to make every 'film cut' feel like a 'knife cut', it's just so very, very good. I can't imagine what it must have been like to see this in theaters in 1960 (which goes for the whole film really).The subsequent scene, while not as iconic and formally inventive, is just as effective in conveying some crucial story and character elements. As we see Norman methodically cleaning up the mess, his mind racing while still acting calm and collected, we realize he's been here before. In a minutes-long wordless sequence, we get to see every painstaking detail of the cover-up, up until the dissolution of the car in the swamp (another great visual moment), and it all feels oddly satisfying. On an unrelated note, I feel like Vince Gilligan must have watched that scene A LOT, because it reminded me of those extended wordless set pieces he used to create in Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul, where we just watch men at work, usually executing some complicated scheme, the intricate details of which are only slowly revealed to us.Back to Psycho. It's as if another film begins during that clean-up scene, as the story definitively shifts from Marion Crane to the film's real protagonist, Norman Bates. We realize now that we have been taken for a ride by that sly Mr. Hitchcock with the whole money theft storyline, as the true crux of the film slowly comes into focus: what is going on with Norman Bates? What about that domineering mother? What other unspeakable events have taken place in that motel and in that large gothic house towering over it? The answers are more horrifying than we could have imagined, revealed (partly) during the masterful climactic sequence, through some memorably ghoulish imagery.My only small gripe with this film upon first viewing was the part right after that, with the psychiatrist explaining everything we just saw at a rapid-fire pace, as if he was tasked with wrapping up the film in a couple of minutes. This time around, the exposition dump didn't even bother me, because A) although it still feels like a somewhat clunky bit of storytelling, I also feel the explanation is necessary to fully unpack the film's final twist and its inherent complex psychology and B) I knew what was still coming: one final high note to end the film on. And sure enough, we get that deranged voice-over as the camera slowly zooms in on Norman's/Mother's face. One final lurid image to be imprinted on the viewer's mind, with Norman's creepy face and smile superimposed on Mother's skull.Anthony Perkins' portrayal of Norman Bates is, of course, another key to the success of this film. I truly believe he gives one of the great performances of all time here. He imbues what could have been a stereotypical 'horror movie villain' with creepiness, charm, vulnerability, intelligence, loneliness and desire, all at once.Obviously, there is so much to unpack psychologically with this film, it makes your head hurt. Once Norman Bates' true nature is revealed, the murder retro-actively becomes an incredibly layered act: on a surface level, it is of course Norman killing Marion, with the act of murder possibly being a metaphor for rape (Norman is clearly shown to be attracted to Marion physically). But as explained by the psychiatrist, it is in fact Mother taking over, triggered by Norman's arousal and (sexual) desire, and it is really her who kills Marion. Finally, I felt as if it was also Norman killing Mother (again), represented by Marion, as she is also having an affair with a married man (surely this is no coincidence). I won't dive into any more of the complex psychology at play with Norman Bates, as this character is already one of the most studied subjects in 'Psychoanalysis' (pun very much intended).One could say that Psycho invented 'elevated horror' before horror itself even existed as a real genre. In addition to having a complex and layered main character, the film boasts a stunning cinematography and maintains a tense atmosphere throughout, while relying on prolific visual techniques to evoke visceral reactions from the audience. Today, that's basically what we would refer to as 'elevated horror'.In conclusion, Psycho is one of my favorite films and a landmark in the history of cinema. If Hitchcock's radical formal inventiveness alone isn't enough to ensure it of that status, consider that Psycho remains one of the most daringly creative films of the 20th century on a narrative level as well, in the way it so boldly broke the established conventions around story structure and incorporated complex psychology into a 'simple horror story'. Not to mention its 'killer twist'. Finally, add to that Bernard Herrmann's iconic score (I can't believe I almost neglected to mention the film's legendary music in this already overlong review!) and an all-time great 'horror villain' (albeit an unconventional one) performance by Anthony Perkins and you have, with Psycho, not only one of the most influential films of all time, but also a film that still holds up today as one of the best ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Iconic, Should be higher than 38 on here.","Alfred Hitchcock is known for Psycho, we all know that, but there is a reason for it, the way it was shot, the script, the shower scene violin music (which by the way I use for when my family calls ) but most importantly because of its change to the whole cinema industry due to its tension and the fact that it shows that a horror doesn't have to be the slash and gore films that had come out before it.There is a reason this film has stood the test of time seeing as it came out over 60 years ago and it is still considered one of all time greats.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Visually impressive, but doesn't hold up.","While I know I'll anger a lot of thriller fans, here's my two cents: this is one of the least enjoyable Hitchcock classics. To clarify: if you compare Psycho to North by Northwest, Strangers on a Train, Vertigo or Rebecca, I can't see how any self-proclaimed film fan wouldn't conclude that it falls considerably short. Even other Hitch classics I don't particularly love or hate (such as The Birds, Rear Window or Marnie) trigger a wider emotional response than the pretty simplistic shock effects which are all Psycho has to offer. Of course there's some great cinematography, but it isn't backed by any involving factors other than sheer horror, or the kind of hammy pseudo-psychology Hitchcock already tried his hand on in Spellbound.My reasonably kind rating of seven out of ten is mostly motivated by its historical importance - even if you take into account that Peeping Tom, which I think is a far superior film with a similar theme, relentlessly flopped earlier in the same year - as it opened the mainstream public's eyes regarding the horror/thriller genre. But if you've seen Psycho once (which, in fact, any film fanatic should), to me there's no real reason to watch it again.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The movie that redefined a genre,"Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho was the movie that revolutionized horror forever. This is a must-see for anyone who calls themselves a connoisseur of horror. And while not the scariest film ever, or even in the top tier, it still provides a marvelous psychological aspect, and some genuinely terrifying moments.Psycho also has one of the most famous horror sequences, and even movie scenes in general. Is there anyone who hasn't heard of the shower scene? This scene is famous for a reason. The eclectic shots, switching so frequently that it almost looks like still frames create an atmosphere of realism. This seems like a newscast, a real event. And that's what is so scary about this movie. It seems completely real, as if these events could happen. Hitchcock caters to the imagination, his brand of fear rooted in emotion, not visuals.Hitchcock's classic black and white tale of passion and horror was revolutionary for the time, and consequently has spawned a slew of imitators. None of these emit the intensity so easily shown in Hitchcock's Psycho. There has even been a remake, a travesty to the original. In the spirit of honor, the 1998 film with Vince Vaughn should change it's name so it won't be associated with this 1960 gem.Hitchcock was, and actually still is, a force to be reckoned with in this league. He is a force of nature. New horror movies come and go, and, aside from a very select few, are forgotten in a matter of months.

A Classic,"Psycho is considered by many critics and audiences as the best horror film ever made. I don't think it is that but it is still impossible to say that it is not a great film and is one of the best horror films ever, maybe top five, but not one. Alfred Hitchcock is on the other hand the best director ever to grace the cinema. He has created some of the best films ever and has never made a bad one. Some of his best are the original The Man Who Knew too Much, Psycho, and North By Northwest. The plot to Psycho is amazing, every thing seems more real than you would expect from this kind of film. The screenplay is also great. With very good characters and dialogue. The screenplay is also very daring doing very new things. The performances are also great. Anthony Perkins in particular is amazing but everyone give great performances. Janet Leigh is probably second best in her Oscar nominated performance. She brings her character to life very well, but Perkins doesn't. He just becomes that character, and that is one of the best performances in history.

I realised it's all the little things Hitchcock does that makes him the ""master of suspense"", even in the first act before the Bates Motel is even remotely part of the film, it's still so nail-biting watching Marion make her escape, but when it culminates in THAT scene, christ.
I do feel as though the second act is a little too slow and predictable, however, but the third, and ESPECIALLY that final scene, bring it home so well.

A Secretary for some rich company. So when she is asked to deliver money to the bank she takes the money. But the money never got there. As the day went by she had so much stress on her mind. So she left town and that was the last anyone had saw her. So on that night it was raining hard so she stops at a low down hotel called the Bates Motel. She then meets the owner of the Hotel Norman Bates. Who lives in a House above the hotel. For awhile the 2 talk with Norman having a crush on her. Then somtime later Maron is taking a shower when she is attacked by a killer.For days the town and Marons sister tried to find her. But no luck.I won't ruin the rest.,,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Hithchcock's masterpiece,"""Psycho"" still remains a classic after thirty-eight years.  It had been imitated by so many slasher films such as ""Halloween,"" ""Friday the 13th,"" ""A Nightmare on Elm Street,"" and ""Scream.""  Not even the pointless 1998 remake can beat Alfred Hitchcock's original.  Anthony Perkins delivers a sincere performance as the mama's boy, Norman Bates who runs a motel.  Janet Leigh also turns in a good performance as the embezzler Marion Crane who checks in and gets stabbed repeatedly in the famous shower scene.  Even the Bernard Herman score is very suspenseful.  The only slasher film that comes close to perfection is ""Halloween.""  Remember: the key is suspense, NOT blood and gore.  My evaluation: **** out of ****.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Owes much of its quality to Bernard Herrmann's score.,"Ofcourse Hitchcock is a great director. But try watching this movie without Bernard Herrmann's score and it will lose almost everything about it. Hitchcock wanted to shoot the shower sequence (most memorable but over-exagerated scene) without any music. Big mistake. Mr. Herrmann thought so too. And now it has become a masterpiece. Talking about the shower scene being over rated; my favorite scene in the film is where the lady is driving at night and it starts raining and she turns on the wipers and she keeps looking at the rear view mirror and then she finally ends up at the motel. That whole sequence is brilliant film making that owes much of its brilliance to Herrmann's score. You feel her anxiety because of her feeling of guilt for what she has done, and we as an audience have a feeling that there isn't something that pleasing awaiting her at the end of the road. How do we know that? Pay attention to how the fast pace of the string ensemble comes to an abrupt change with pizzicatos and low resonance bows, once we see the sign of the motel. And notice how the cue leads up to that part; pure genius at work here, ladies and gentleman. If it weren't for Herrmann's musical score, this film would be just an average movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Saw it in 1960,"I saw this movie in a packed house in 1960 without any knowledge of the plot--and judging by the reaction of the audience when the shower scene occurred, no one else had knowledge either.When the scene began developing, there were gasps. When the curtain few open there were screams, and they continued during the stabbing. A state of fright literally hung over the theater. When Ms. Leigh slid down slowly, dying, people were still gasping and crying out. They were there! They had witnessed a real murder! Nothing in any previous movie had prepared the audience for this kind of shock.It was years before I could take a shower and not re-experience that state of fright again.Maybe you had to be there to understand this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Horror classic that lives up to its reputation.,"The best way to approach Psycho would be with no previous knowledge at all. As it is, the shower scene has become one of the most notorious film shots of all-time, and the secret of the Bates family is no longer quite so secretive.However, even with this in mind, this is an amazing classic : the original horror movie.  Hitchcock has always been the master of suspense, and Psycho is just about his most sinister ever.  From the Gothic setting - the imposing mansion on the hill - to Norman's boyish manner and tortured intensity, Psycho delivers.And if it doesn't make you scream (or at least think twice before talking to that self-effacing stranger), nothing will.  Psycho truly is an incomparable portrait of a mind twisted into homicidal mania that fully deserves the accolades it has always received.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Would utterly fail in lesser hands,"One of Alfred Hitchcock's most well-known films. Regarded as one of the very first examples of the slasher genre. Still one of the most beloved thrillers ever made and an all-around classic. The shower scene movie.And yet, if that's all you know the movie from, you're missing a lot. The shower scene was scandalous back in its day, much like the rest of the film in general, but it doesn't encapsulate the film all that well. It happens near the middle of the film and a lot happens after it. Sure, it is the most striking scene in the film, but I would personally put more weight on the overall performances of Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates and Janet Leigh as Marion Crane.With these two powerful actors Hitchcock manages to tell a truly haunting and nerve-wracking story. Because, to be honest, nowadays the movie would be a bit boring and a lot predictable. The viewer is never truly confused as to where the film is going. But in a way that even enhances the experience. Because you can so clearly see why these characters would make these decisions given the amount of information they have.Add in some masterful camerawork, some really insightful use of surroundings and shadows, the two main actors and a one of the creepiest scores ever produced, and you have a masterful film in your hands.A must see film for all fans of horror and still a really, really good experience all around, despite its age.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Hitch's best,"What else can I add about this film?  One of the more famous settings ever (the motel), one of the most famous movie names (Norman Bates), and of course, probably the most memorable killing on film (shower, anyone?). There's no real point in summing up again, but, what the hay.  Leigh embezzels money and skips town.  She ends up at a remote motel and has dinner with the owner (Perkins).  Though long winded, the scene in the parlor stays captivating with the dialogue and the subtle music softly in the background.   They both discuss the things wrong in their lives, his biggest problem, his domineering ""mother"" (and I always wondered if people who haven't seen the film thought of when every critic always put quotations around mother).  She retires for the night, and while unwinding with a shower, is brutally knifed by some woman.  The mother?  You'll find out if you haven't seen it.  The rest of the film deals with Perkins trying to cover up the crime, as others come looking for Leigh.  I say it's Hitchcocks best, but that's mostly based on the fact that I didn't like his other movies (""Frenzy"" was ok).  Performance wise, you couldn't ask for much more, as Perkins is terrifically understated as Norman, the role that pidgeon-holed the rest of his career.  He pretty much carries the film as the others, good actors no doubt, have little screen time.  A sequel followed 23 years later(!), one I went for more being a kid of the 80s. Part III was good as well (Perkins directed nicely), but IV was a lame made for cable film.  There was also an awful remake in 98, check it out at your own risk.  As far as the beginning of it all, it can be slow in spots, but is a well told story and one of only a few films before the 80s that I liked.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"One of the scariest, and best horror films of all time!!","Psycho is a pure classic, that along with Halloween is the scariest movie ever made. Anthony Perkins stars as the famous Norman Bates, who in fact is a psycho. Now how he comes in the story is this: Janet Leigh plays Marion Crane, she steals $40,000 from her boss, flees the town, and buys a new car. She decides to stay at a hotel, cleverly named The Bates Motel (Vacancy). Run by a timid, yet sweet man whose name is Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), now this man, is attracted to this woman, asked her for dinner, she declines. Now for the most famous scene in a horror film, she decides to take a shower, while he watches. He hears his mom calling him, so he goes up and sees what's wrong. While Marion Crane is taking a shower, the mother comes down and brutally stabs her to death. After all this, and people start to notice that she is gone, her sister and her boyfriend, decide to check out this motel. They hire an investigator to look into it. He finds nothing wrong with the place. What happens to him? Well you'll have to see the movie. Anyway, the sister and boyfriend, investigate and find out what Norman Bates really is. The film is extremely well-acted, not to mention directed by the master himself, Alfred Hitchcock.

Best Horror movie of all Time,"Psycho is the one true horror film, it's better than other great horror movies like The Shining, Halloween, The Exorcist, and it's better than Hitchcock's classic The Birds. This is the movie with the shower/murder scene that is possibly the most referenced scene in movie history. Everything about that scene is classic, from the camera angles, to the music, to the blood running into the sink(which was chocolate syrup since the movie was in black and white).This is a very difficult film to write a review on. What I can say is take the advice given by Alfred Hitchcock at the showing of this movie when it was in the theater. His advice was to not even enter the movie if it had already started, because it can only be seen from the beginning. That is exactly how this movie is meant to be seen. Despite being in black and white, this movie is still a shocking experience. I think it should have been a crime to do what Hollywood did, they made a remake of this. When Hollywood does a remake of such a classic film like Psycho, then you know that they are very desperate to make money.Everybody should see this, it is almost a perfect movie and is still shocking today.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

One of the Greatest Ever Made,"Psycho (1960)**** (out of 4)There's really no point in giving a synopsis for this film. If you don't already know what this movie is about then you really need to stop reading this right now and go watch the movie. I've seen this movie dozens of times over the years from VHS to DVD to Blu- ray and I've seen it at least five times on the big screen and for my money this is Alfredy Hitchcock's greatest film and one of the greatest ever made. I know VERTIGO, a brilliant movie, gets all the love and respect but for my money this here is his greatest film.Where do you start with a movie like this? Everyone knows that the budget was slashed on the director and it certainly helped the film because had this been in color or had it been lavished with a big budget then it just wouldn't have the same feel. The movie has some of the most historic moments in film history that everyone knows about. These moments are of course the shower sequence as well as the ending. Both certainly deserve to be mentioned whenever you discuss brilliant scenes but for my money the greatest sequence in the movie is what happens before the shower sequence and it's the discussion between Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) and Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) as they discuss what is basically holding them back.The performances between the two actors are just so flawless and this scene is so important because it tells us everything we need to know going into the second half of the movie, which is pretty much after the shower scene. The first portion of the movie we're worried and caring about the Crane character but we get the shock of what happens and then our sympathy immediately turns to Norman and him helping his mother. The way Hitchcock pulls this off is rather remarkable but the shocks keep happening with one terrific twist after another leading up to the ending.What's always amazed me about this movie is how your initial viewing is nothing but pure shocks and gasps but then on repeat viewings, even when you know all the secrets, you can enjoy it just as much because you can then enjoy the film by watching a master handle the material. You can watch for the clues and see all the winks that Hitchcock is giving the viewer. No matter how many times I watch this film I can simply sit back and enjoy it on so many levels. It's a movie where you brain knows what's going on but the film is just so great that you can enjoy everything and wish that the character's fate changes somehow.Everything from the performances to the score to the cinematography are flawless. This is without question one of the most impressive movies ever made. It's certainly a ground-breaking picture that has its legendary director at the top of his game. PSYCHO has been copied countless times over the past fifty-five years but nothing has come close to its impact.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Best Directed Film Ever,"I love Psycho so much I can't begin to describe what it means to me. The trouble is it has been over-sold in the last twenty years or so that it is known as the film with THAT scene in the shower. There's so much more to it than that. It is arguably the most influential film ever made, and the best directed one at that. Without it, there would be no Jaws, no Godfather, no Star Wars. Psycho may not be the greatest film ever made, nor the scariest film ever made, but is probably the best crafted thriller and a fine example of cinematic manipulation. Psycho continues to influence filmmakers. Look at the Psycho references in 2005's Houseof Wax (preservered mother, twin sons/ split personality, scary house on the hill.) Psycho is simply Great.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Classic,"I was first introduced to Alfred Hitchcock when I was very young, however, it was not until now that I knew what a monumental influence he had on film. In my college film class we had the chance to view Psycho and i have to admit at first, i was not extremely excited about it. However, I was hooked in the first five minutes of the film and I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. I love psychological thrillers that make you wonder and think ""outside the box"" and i think this was one of the best i have ever seen. I think that Alfred's choices for the movie, (director, characters, etc.) were great. I thought all the characters did a fabulous job. The story line and plot were very creative too. I felt like i was being surprised every five minutes. I also like that this is an old black and white film.

We All Go a Little Mad Sometimes,"I can't decide whether ""Psycho"" or ""Rear Window"" is Hitchcock's best film. My answer on any given day is usually dependent on which one I've most recently watched.There's no need to go into the performances, or the shocking story, or the Bernard Herrman score (one of the best ever in film history). All that's been covered. Having just watched this film again in honor of Halloween weekend, I was struck fresh by the movie's frankness, which had to have been beyond uncomfortable for film audiences at the time. Supposedly film executives on screening this film were shocked more than anything else by the shots of the toilet in the hotel bathroom. If that was enough to shock, then what about references to transvestites, sexual arousal and release, and the blood-splattered bathroom that Hitchcock shows Perkins cleaning up in rigorous detail? The movie is so honest about the human body, its more unpleasant urges and physical qualities, that when the camera follows a swirl of blood down the shower drain, you half expect to see a big clump of hair sticking out of it. And to think this film came out at the same time as Douglas Sirk was making his films, in which women are as carefully painted and polished as china dolls.The true test of a great film is how well it stands up to the test of time, and whether or not you can revisit it and find something new in it each time you do so. By that measure, ""Psycho"" is truly one of the greats.Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Movie Out of Time,"It took me 48 years to see this movie. Not a fan of the horror genre, I generally avoid them. But there have been a few that I've see that are really good. Psycho is a good film but time has passed it by, it is a movie out of time and just does not carry the punch it did in 1960.Technology advances degrade much of technique used in this film. Audiences today are too sophisticated to be drawn into a film like this. Modern horror movies depend heavily on special effects and not on the subtleties used in Psycho. Being released in black & white is an advantage and helps give the film a feel of being the classic it is.Anthony Perkins is superb in the role as Norman Bates. Other than Martin Balsam and Perkins though, the rest of the actors deliver only average performances. The lines are rigid and often lame, again the effect of time passing the method by. Perkins however can take the worst role and give it smoothness.I'll not reveal any spoilers but for a movie so referenced and so often used in comedy and serious pieces, it is impossible to see this movie today without knowing what happens to the main characters.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Set the standard,"1960.  Alfred Hitchcock is, for his time, king of the world, with a string of hit movies, a hit TV show, and even growing critical respect (from ""auteur"" critics like Andrew Sarris and Francois Truffaut).  Flush with all of this success, did Hitchcock continue making the glossy entertainments he excelled at in the 1950's?  No.  Instead, he made a low-budget film which was obviously influenced by B-movies (notably the ones made by William Castle) and what he had learned on TV.  The result was PSYCHO, and it's safe to say movies were never the same again.Many articles have been written claiming Spielberg and Lucas have been responsible for the decline of movies today, and have been responsible for more cheap rip-offs than anyone else.  It seems to me Hitchcock and PSYCHO have inspired (if that's the right word) more rip-offs than Spielberg or Lucas put together.  Not just the obvious ways, like the many horror films which pay homage to it (DRESSED TO KILL, HALLOWEEN), or the films which have spoofed it(HIGH ANXIETY).  There's also its influence in narrative(speeding things up, instead of taking time to tell the story), its reliance on fairly thin characters, sparse dialogue, and of course, that music.  Someone more qualified than I could go at length at how Hitchcock's technique here has echoed throughout moviemaking today, but that influence to is undeniable.  I guess to sum up, PSYCHO does what Spielberg, Lucas, and every blockbuster film have been accused of doing; making a B-movie on the scale of an A-movie(of course, Hitchcock had a lower budget, but he did have stars like Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins, and well-known actors like John Gavin, Martin Balsam, and Vera Miles).As the rip-offs shouldn't put you off the Spielberg and Lucas films, nor should the rip-offs put you off of PSYCHO(I haven't seen the remake yet, but I still want to).  No matter how many times you've seen it before, the shower scene still packs a wallop.  So does the climax in the basement, and the final shot of Norman.  Perkins avoids the mistake most movie psychos (pardon the expression) make today by hamming it up; although you suspect something, you're prepared to dismiss him until you find out the truth.  This isn't my favorite Hitchcock (that honor goes to NORTH BY NORTHWEST), but it's a classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"a classic, but hardly Hitch's best","The first time I saw this film I was quite disappointed.  So much of it has become cliché in the four decades since its release, including the famous shower scene, Perkins' oedipal relationship with his mother, and even Bernard Herrmann's unsettling score.  I had known the identity of Perkins' ""mother"" even before I saw the film and had to be told by a sibling that the audience was not supposed to be aware of this up to the last.  It was like knowing the punch line in advance and not really getting the joke once it was actually told.  It is, to be sure, a tribute to Hitchcock that this film has become so much a part of North American popular culture, but the downside is that the element of shock that so affected audiences back in 1960 is almost entirely lost on a later generation of viewers.  One thus has to imagine what it would have been like to see it during its first run in the movie theatres.Had I been there at its opening, I think I would still have judged this film to be inferior to the string of excellent Hitchcock offerings preceding it during the previous decadefrom ""Strangers on a Train"" to ""North by Northwest.""  Why?  So much of his previous work had relied on the use of suspense to draw the viewers into the plot.  A good thriller builds this up carefully and deliberately until the final climax at or near the end of the film.  Good suspense leaves much unstated and works its way subtly into the imagination.  It's what you don't see that's the scariest. Think, for example, of the murder in ""Rear Window.""  You hear a crash and a short, shrill scream followed by ominous silence, but you're not really sure what's happened until much later.  Here, on the other hand, Hitch kills off his heroine brutally near the beginning of the film, leaving little if anything to the imagination, and largely putting aside the issues we had been misled to think the plot was building up to.Moreover, despite Hitch's tongue-in-cheek claim that he had intended it as a comedy, there is little of the director's famous humour so much in evidence in the immediately preceding film, ""North by Northwest.""  There is not much humour to be found in shock, while there is great humorous potential in suspense.  He should have stuck with suspense and left shock to a lesser director.I alluded to Herrmann's score.  Without it, I think this would have been judged a far less effective film and less the classic it is generally reputed to be.  Imagine Leigh driving along the highway without the composer's jittery music in the backgroundor, perhaps more accurately, the foreground.  In such scenes it is the music that almost entirely creates the suspenseful atmosphere.  Without it there is nothing of the sortjust Leigh driving and looking in her rear view mirror.  Period.  Not very scary.Is it a classic then?  It is, insofar as it influenced a whole generation of movie-goers and film makers who sought to imitate it.  But on its own merits, I don't think so.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Hitchcock has yet to disappoint me.,"I consider myself relatively new to Hitchcock's films. Before Psycho, it was The Birds and Vertigo. Vertigo got me hooked, so I decided to give the 1960 Psycho a day in court after seeing the 1998 remake. I now see why a remake was such an infamous move, at least remaking it word for word and scene for scene. Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho stands rightfully so as one of the greatest horror/psychological flicks of all time. Alfred Hitchcock's direction as always is on point and the acting is wonderful, especially the Norman Bates character. A truly deranged individual. If you pay enough attention, you can piece together the ending before it actually happens, but even then it's still shocking based on Hitchcock's amazing shooting style. I give this a 10/10.

It's a movie about a woman(Leigh) who is out driving on a rainy night(after stealing a lot of money) and she stops at a motel where the owner has a mother, but is very lonely and befriends her. When she takes a shower, the figure of an old lady walks in and stabs her to death in the shower(this is remembered as the famous ""shower scene"").

"Overrated, underperformed B-movie","Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" has gone down in history as one of the most psychologically disturbing thrillers ever made. I strongly disagree. I started this movie fully expecting to be disturbed and scared, but finished it feeling robbed. The problem with this movie is the hype. Had it not been hyped as the scariest film ever made, than it would have gone over better. But as it stands, Psycho DOESN'T stand. Back in 1960, movie-going Americans were not at all expecting this, had never seen anything like this, and were probably very shocked when they did. This movie started the endless number of slasher-type films we know today, such as ""Halloween"", and the Jason series. Of them, I can't say Psycho is any better. Hitchcock does well with the cinematography, but falls short in the suspense area. His predecessors, such as Ridley Scott (Alien), Robert Zemeckis (What Lies Beneath), and many others succeeded where he failed. The acting in Psycho is pretty good, though sometimes mechanical. Bottom-line: If you have NEVER seen a horror film, particularly of the slasher type, than you will find this a chilling film. But for modern, decensitized America, it will only be looked at as a good B-movie.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Key Scene in Depth,"In sixty years of movie watching there's one extended scene in Psycho that I count as being of unsurpassed brilliance. That's the about 7-minute scene in Norman's parlor where Marion has a bite of dinner shortly after arriving at the motel. To get an idea of its impact and significance, the setting is important. The parlor is dimly lit, casting shadows appropriate to the Gothic plot. Norman sits on one side, a stuffed raptor on the adjacent wall. It's shrewdly placed since the menacing wing-spread can background Norman when Hitch so chooses. Marion sits on the opposite side in a more conventionally lit setting, bespeaking her more conventional nature. Significantly, Hitch cross-cuts between them the entire time, never showing them in the same frame, thus emphasizing Norman's uniqueness and dominating part of the conversation.Now Norman is clearly unsure how to talk to the attractive woman alone with him in this, a private room. So he launches into a safe topic for him, but completely inappropriate to the light meal Marion is eating, namely his hobby, taxidermy. That is, how he likes to stuff birds but not the gore that comes with beasts. This tells us the important point that Norman is inexperienced socially, an aspect that fits in as the various parts of his nature come together over the movie's time-line. Throughout the tete-a-tete, Marion maintains a cautious but polite reserve as Hitch crosscuts between them. Her role here is mainly to draw the boyish stranger out.From taxidermy the dialog takes a more intimate turn. What emerges from the next topic, namely how to fill one's time, is that Norman is uncomfortable with his life with Mom. At the same time, however, he tries to casually laugh it off, one of his main defense mechanisms. Marion suggests that perhaps he should leave, that is, go away. But Norman senses something. He may be confused about a lot of things, but he's intuitive when he interjects that Marion must be running away from something, as indeed she is.At this point the conversation takes on a momentum that is revealing more and more about Norman's inner life. That's apparent when he starts talking ominously about private traps from which no one can escape—how we ""scratch and claw"" (like a bird) but never to any avail. To Marion, this is a challenge to escape the embezzlement trap she's gotten herself into. To Norman, it's a disclosure of how he views his own life, and an excuse for not doing anything about it as though in his madness he could.At this point, Marion senses Norman's problem lies with his mother and suggests that he get away from the motel and from her. Once the topic turns to Mother, Hitch frames Norman in the foreground with the ominous stuffed bird (Mother) looming over him. Now we know Norman is indeed trapped and that Marion is venturing into dangerous territory. She accelerates the danger by suggesting that he should put Mom away, like ""in an institution or something"". This triggers a sudden, hostile response as Norman associates strangers and unfamiliar surroundings with thoughts of death, as indeed it would be for him. But true to his defense mechanisms, he does an abrupt 180 and laughs off the suggestion with the supreme irony that whatever her problems, at least Mom's ""harmless"". Then in another note of supreme irony, he trivializes her problem by saying that anyway we all go ""a little mad sometimes"". This of course would include Marion by inference, who now has a sense of her own embezzlement predicament and breaks off the conversation by resolving to return to Phoenix and face the music. At the same time, Norman reverts to his usual affable façade. And the scene ends. But unbeknownst to Marion, she may have resolved one trap, but has now entered a far more deadly one.This is the central scene of the film. It's not the most dramatic, but it is the one where we gain important insight into Norman's mental processes. Now as good as the writing and direction are, it's really Tony Perkins's exquisite performance that makes the seven minutes absolutely spellbinding. Watch how quickly and persuasively he changes expression and mood. Because of his expertise, we know that something's seriously wrong with Norman, but can't be sure exactly what, while it takes the rest of the movie to find out. One moment, he's all boyish charm, the next he's glaring darkly with inner fire.Of course, Janet Leigh's superb performance as Marion should not be overlooked. In this key scene, her task is to politely draw out Norman's feelings, an essentially secondary role, but demanding in its own way. Note how delicately she balances her bites of food with proper emotional composure as this strange man reveals more of himself to her. Without doubt, this was an actress with more than just a pretty face.To me, Perkins' eccentric performance is clearly Oscar worthy, ditto the picture itself, along with Hitch's masterful direction. But industry prejudices against horror movies was just too strong then and perhaps now. Of course, it didn't help for Oscar purposes that the production was also low-budget b&w. But I doubt the audience impact would have been nearly as great had that unforgettable package been upscaled in any fashion. At the same time, a big part of the classic flick, in my book, at least, rests with that 7-minutes of emerging horror, so brilliantly understated.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Greatest Movie of All Time!,"I viewed this movie at the age of 9 years old. It has been my favorite movie ever since. Almost 20 years. The two movies that affected me most as a child were: ""The Amityville Horror"" (I've had more dreams about that house than any other thing..ever!) and ""Psycho"". After watching ""Psycho"", I never viewed ANYTHING as being 100% safe. No castles, no zombies, no monsters. Normal people in risky situations exposed before all. Everyone has skeletons in their closets. Even those who seem to be as harmless as a fly. (Such as Norman Bates). This movie not only changed the course of movie history, by killing off the apparent heroine 1/3 of the way through the film (making history) but, proved that their was absolutely NOWHERE to be totally safe. It revealed inner demons of the two main characters which reflect on the entire world and maybe the truest description of how the world really is. Deep down we all have these bad thoughts, but unlike Norman Bates, most of us can bottle them up inside and carry them to the grave.After all, ""we all go a little mad...sometimes"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Alfred Hitchcock's best...,After all these years Alfred Hitchcock decided to make himself the master of horror. Psycho is the film that terrified the generation of '60.But the weird and spectacular thing about Psycho is that it can terrify as well our generation.

THE GREATEST FILM EVER MADE,"Anything i would say has already been said but still it's worth crediting this masterpiece again. What else would you want with a movie great direction, superb acting,great set,great story With one of the best acting performances of our time Anthony Perkins created something that other actors have never been able to accomplish that is successfully he made someone you'd never suspect. Sure you might have thought him to be the one when you first saw it but he crafted a man whose emotions you would think would definitely help his mother but wouldn't join with her Hitchcock who is also the best director of all time sends a never again greatly crafted 100 K Diamond to the screen with a magnificiant  SHING!!! of the blade",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The best horror movie ever,"I have watched this film about four times now, and I can safely say that this is the best horror movie ever. The actors are the best thing about it. Anthony Perkins is superb as the shy, gorgeous, boyish Norman Bates. His twitchings and stammerings are scarily flawless, and the scene where the car stops momentarily sinking into the swamp, and he stares with a look of pure terror in his eyes, then ultimate relief when it continues are unforgettable. His ""...I wouldn't even harm a fly"" face at the end is inimitable. As for Janet Leigh, she couldn't have gotten into her part more. She looks genuinely desperate when confronted by the police officer. Hitchcock controls the audience as if he were pressing keys on a piano with this film. Everything is perfect about this film, and has become one of my personal favourites. If you haven't seen it, see it now.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of the greats,"This film is without doubt a classic.  One of very few films to maintain any sort of mystery and suspense despite its ageing.

Hitch's best,"Psycho is more than just one of the best films of all-time. It is the inspiration behind a great number of films since and will forever be THE ultimate in both plot twists and suspense. Who would have ever imagined killing off both the main character and what seemed like an interesting story only a third into the film? Well, Hitch did and even told the moviegoers at the time to show up for the beginning of the film or else miss the wonderful Janet Leigh.Psycho has it all. A great story, well two as a matter of fact. One of the greatest scores by Bernard Herrmann (how many people don't know the skreetching violin and deep tuba sounds that really make the shower scene a classic?). The acting is superb with the chilling, almost-too-real portrayal of Norman Bates by Anthony Perkins and the running scared, almost-too-clued-out portrayal of Marion Crane by Janet Leigh. The supporting cast complete the film like few other casts do. Vera Miles makes the role of Crane's sister, honestly real and more than just a plot device.This film succeeds in all aspects, including the ending which is often said to be overlong and unecessary. Without hearing the inner thoughts of Bates, however, would leave a gaping hole in the production. The double image of Bates face with his mother's scull remains chilling, even in today's glorified, Natural Born Killers-like ultraviolence. Hitch's direction and shot techniques are as innovative as those seen in some of his earlier films like Vertigo and North-by-Northwest. Next time you watch Psycho, slow down the shower scene just to see how many separate shots Hitch put together to make it so great. Quite calculated.It's a shame that a film like Psycho had to have been marred by a few sequels and a terribly awful shot-by-shot remake. Unlike a continuing storyline like that of ""The Godfather"", this story should have ended here.Full recommendation.9/10 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Interesting and Scary,"I do not enjoy seeing black and white movie, by chance my cable tv shown this movie couple of years ago then i decided to watch it.I do not really know what this movie is all about until i see the part where Bates talking to his mother and i assumed the person is really his mother. A rather strange and make me guessing as the shower scene come out and the famous tune ""ing ing ing ing, deng deng..."" It makes glue to my sit and watch the entire movie instead.At the end of the movie, i then realised the mother is already dead and Norman Bates is considered as a person with psychiatric problem who impersonated his mother. It is really shocking and make me feel this movie is a must see thriller.Then the remake appeared and of course the audience will know what happen. The difference? colour,sound.

"Marion Crane makes off with forty thousand dollars from one of her company's clients, but decides to return it after staying one night at an empty motel run by a Norman Bates.","The plot was small, but interesting and I enjoyed how the scenes were shot and cut, but considering how this is not the early 60's anymore, people shouldn't watch the movie if they want to get scared because the story itself isn't all that thrilling, not because it was badly written, but because the plot twists have been dulled due to their being so famous now. Janet Leigh, a popular name back in the day and Jamie Lee Curtis's mother, has enough screen time for her character to be better appreciated and Anthony Perkins's portrayal of Norman Bates is both amiable and creepy.

Psycho is a good thriller,"Said to be Alfred Hitchcock's most terrifying film and it sure is with its compelling story and stunning score.

""She just goes a little mad sometimes"" according to Norman Bates in his conversion with Marion. This leads to the famous shower scene and the compelling events that follow when Marion's sister is trying to find out what had happened to her. The ending of this movie is shocking and surprising.

But 50 years from now, people will remember the original and not the remake. A lot of people these days will be turned off by the movie because it's old and in black and white, but everyone should see.  It's a technical marvel, Hitchcock was a wizard with the camera. There are also terrific performances by Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins.  This movie basically started the whole slasher film genre that John Carpenter kick-started in 1978 with Halloween.

Alfred Hitchcock gives us a perfect technical motion picture, in the camera movements, cinematography, editing (how can you not get thrilled in the shower scene) and special effects, with a surprising and inspired screenplay, that keeps the viewer hypnotized the whole length of the film, a music score that matches the film perfectly, a display of the human experience, with greed, betrayal, sexuality, repression, morality, insanity, instinct, desire, violence, motherhood and passion, and outstanding performances by Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh, without mentioning the rest of the cast, which is great too.

"Well, a Hitchcock's fan's best friend is his ""Psycho"".","This is what great thrillers are all about.  It's rather hard to tell a lot about this masterpiece without spoiling some of the surprises contained in it but I'll try my best to spoil as little as possible.This is definitely Hitchcock's best picture and it's really great.  For this movie, Hitchcock took many actors that were rather unknowns and made them movie stars by having perfectly directed them.  Plus, the idea and the script are exceptional and don't have any flaws.  And if that's not enough for you, just think of all the people that are afraid to take showers when they are all alone in their houses because of the traumatizing shower in the movie.  Anthony Perkins is brilliant as the hermit called Norman Bates who lives alone with his ""mother"".It's pure genius and keeps you guessing until the end.

Among the Most Influential Films of All Time,"This film has to rank as probably one of the most influential films ever made. It's one of those films that is referenced constantly. By the way, this is a film where the less you know about it beforehand, the more powerful it is. In fact in the original advertising, Hitchcock asked viewers not to reveal the film's shocks to their friends afterwards, and also that viewers had to be seated from the beginning of the film (when ""Psycho"" was released people were in the habit of walking into movies at any point). As a result, i will try my best not to give too much away.Based on a fairly good thriller by Robert Bloch, inspired by the life and crimes of real-life serial killer Ed Gein, this movie constantly unsettles the viewer. Hitchcock knew about suspense and he knew how to manipulate an audience which he does here brilliantly. Almost everything in this film is pitch perfect and the shocks are still striking. The actors, especially the brilliant Anthony Perkins, are all superb. Special note has to be taken of the famous score by Bernard Herrmann.Whether or not you're a horror movie fan, this is a must-see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The 2nd and 3rd viewings will put interesting questions in your mind like ""Will Marion go with Norman or Sam?"" or ""What ever happens to Norman later on?"" (of course two sequels were made to solve this one)but most of all this movie should be remembered for being based on probably the greatest murderer of our time named Ed Gein (who is even more psychopath than this movie describes him as).

A must-see,"Especially if you are into thrillers. I haven't seen the shot-by-shot remake that came out, 10 years or so ago, but if you watch one Psycho, it should be this one. Actually if you watch more than one Psycho, it would be good if you'd watch the other Psychos (Psycho 2, 3 and so forth). Although they are with Anthony Perkins, I'm pretty sure they are not as good as this one though.A very eerie performance by Mr. Perkins then, with a very interesting idea (that hopefully comes as a surprise when you watch it, because it would be a shame if someone did spoil you the movie, by telling you what will happen). Quite a few things get done here and other directors have taken those ideas and used them time and again. It's a testament to Hitchcocks genius, how good his movie works and still how much tension is in it, because it hasn't aged a bit.A great movie, by a great director. I watched it recently at a cinema, but I have to admit, that I missed the small cameo Hitchcock has in his movies. That's saying something about how gripping the movie was for me.

"An important film not just as a watershed moment, but for its brutal and psychological approach to the thriller genre that endures to this day","When Marion Crane (Janey Leigh) sees an opportunity to steal $40,000 so she can free her boyfriend, Sam (John Gavin), of his debts so they can finally be married Marion takes the opportunity and rushes to California to meet him. Thoughts of paranoia, panic, and guilt haunt Marion as she travels the isolated interstate roads in a near constant state of tension and unease. When she's forced by bad weather to stop for the night at the isolated Bates Motel, she meets the manager, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), a soft spoken, timid, but seemingly well meaning man who sets her up for the night unaware of the terror that awaits her at the hands of Norman's mother.Released in 1960 to polarizing reviews but massive audience approval and huge box office, Psycho has become a pop culture touchstone with music, characters, story beats, and iconography routinely referenced, homage, and parodied. Based on the 1959 novel of the same name by Robert Bloch the books premise of creating sympathetic characters only to kill them off in situations that resembled Ed Gein spoke to Hitchcock who fought tooth and nail to get the film made against the wishes of executives who found the premise too lurid and tasteless. Using his TV crew from the TV show Alfred Hitchcock Presents and banking more on his prestige than resources to draw names the film was nothing short of a miracle to get off the ground with resistance from both executives and censors who were irked by the film's brazen disregard for production code guidelines. The movie against the expectations of all Hitchcock's naysayers created a haunting psychological thriller with a sense of style and dread that uses limited resources to great effect.With Psycho there's so many elements that come together it's hard to pick out just one, from Bernard Herrmann's iconic string heavy musical score that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats in states of tension that are the only respite from creeping terror, to the cinematography by John L. Russell that perfectly frames the shots from the most iconic to the seemingly inconsequential this is maximum effect with minimum resources. The flourishes are well done, but they'd be ultimately meaningless without a solid story to back them up. Hitchcock creates intriguing characters and atmosphere from the get go with desperate stakes motivating instigating actions and brining relatability to the characters so we care about what's going on. Anthony Perkins is the central point of Psycho in Norman Bates and his performance is pitch perfect with his mannerisms, delivery, and body language conveying a story in and of itself. From Norman's meek politeness, to his discomfort with his own sexuality, and hair trigger temper Perkins hits all the right notes to make Norman both tragic and threatening.Psycho is an important film not just for pushing the boundaries of sex and violence but also in unconventional storytelling and audience misdirection. With a storyline that isn't afraid to yank the rug out from the audiences feet to scenes that are designed to make the audience uncomfortable, psycho understands how to get under its audience's skin and take them to the darkest recesses of humanity.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The exaggerated murder scenes and the music are two of the most copied horror techniques I have ever seen, and they originated in this film, and only in this film are they artistic. What sets this film apart from others in its genre is the fact that it is not all massacre. There's more suspense than anything else; impending doom. The murderer is not even the central character. A series of strokes of bad judgment from Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), the character who really stokes the fires, sparks a sinister chain of events.

"""We All Go A Little Mad Sometimes...""","Psycho takes a lot of credit for starting the modern horror genre. Well, I must say that it deserves it. Before Psycho, censorship was extremely strict. Psycho broke a lot of rules in its day... not only did it go above and beyond with its famous murder sequences, but it also went above and beyond with smaller censorship rules. Psycho was the first American film where the audience could clearly see a flushing toilet in full frame. Psycho was also the first film to show a women walking around in her under-garments for an extended period of time. If Psycho had not come around, it could very well be possible that the idea of Jason stabbing a teenage couple having sex would have been frowned upon by the censorship boards. Psycho changed the way movies where made, which is what opened up the idea of the slasher film, and the horror genre in general.There had been horror films before Psycho, but none broke all of the rules that Psycho had. All the rules that Psycho broke became rules that everyone broke. For this reason, there have been too many Psycho rip-offs to count. Scream, Friday the 13th, Saw, A Nightmare On Elm Street, Halloween, and even Black Christmas are all pure rip-offs of Psycho's success. This could very well be Psycho's only con, and it isn't even the film's fault. Now don't get me wrong, Halloween and Friday the 13th are good films, but if you are at all interested in horror/suspense, you have to view the movie that set new standards for the genre when it was released in 1960.Today, in 2008, Psycho doesn't seem nearly as well done as it was when it was released. However, it is just as good as it used to be. The only reason it doesn't seem good is because of one thing... publicity. AFI, Youtube, Google... It's all the same. Surly everyone alive today has seen the shower scene somewhere, whether or not they have seen the movie. I had personally seen certain scenes before viewing the film itself, so a large amount of the impact was lost for me. Psycho still left a chill on my back, and worked very well. If you are one of the lucky few who haven't seen clips of Psyhco, I highly encourage that you do not search for any. Search out the movie itself.As for the film itself, it is purely remarkable. The cast is extremely remarkable. Anthony Perkins is extremely amazing in his role as Norman Bates. Perkin's performance isn't only Oscar-Worthy, it is also one of the greatest performances of all time. It is up there with Anthony Hopkins' role as Hannibal Lector in my book. Janet Leight and Vera Miles are also very good actresses, and fit the role of heroine in Psycho very well. The acting in Psycho doesn't seem dated at all.The suspense is also spectacular in Psycho. Alfred Hitchcock's brilliant directing and Bennard Herrman's chilling score work together to build up atmosphere and suspense for the film. This is done extremely well. Psycho may very well be one of the most suspenseful movies of all time. Another thing that helps with the amount of atmopshere of the movie is how real it looks and feels. Everything in this movie seems realistic to the viewer. You can relate to the people in the film, especially with the way the characters are developed.Psycho may very well be the flawless movie. It has everything to not only make it a great horror film, but a great film as well. Any horror fan should check out Psycho, simply because it set so many new levels in the genre. Any film fan in general should check out Psycho is well, simply because it is so well made. Psycho is a must view for everyone.A lot of the movies from the 50s and 60s seem very cheesy by today's standards of computer animation and slang talk. However, Psycho still fits in with the classics. This is because Alfred Hitchcock directed his movies for the audience, not for the critics. This is obviously why the critics responded terribly to it. There were very few positive reviews for Psycho by all of the huge film critics, yet it still ranks as the 21st greatest film ever made on the IMDb top list. Hitchcock was able to not only make this movie well, but he was also able to make it enjoyable.Psycho still ranks in with the HORROR classics as well. Perhaps this is due the way it inspired so many films to come after it. This may also be due the fact that Psycho plays with all of the fears that thrilled audiences just as much today as it did in 1960; The thrill of running from the police; The fear of run-down motels; The fear of strangers; The feel of taking showers alone; and of course: The fear of our mother's rage.For more horror film reviews, check out my channel on youtube: horrorreviews123",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A horror thriller that will keep you hanging onto your chair!,"PSYCHO (1960)Directed By: Alfred HitchcockBook Base: Robert Block Screen Play: Joseph StephaniMusic: Bernard Hermann Cinematography: John Russell Film Editing by: George TomasiniCast: Anthony Perkins (Norman Bates),Vera Miles (Lila Crane), John Gavin (Sam Louis), Marion Crane (Janet Leigh)Psycho is an astounding film produced and directed by Alfred Hitchcock. Hitchcock is known for Movies with surprise endings while keeping you wondering what will happen next. This film is a must see for everyone, even those who do not like horror movies.The movie is about a woman, Marion Crain (Janet Leigh)who seems to be a little on the naughty side, but honest. Marion is honest until the day she decides to steal $40,000 in cash from her employer. Marion leaves town by vehicle to be with her boyfriend who is penniless. Marion travels a long distance and starts to get tired and pulls into the Bates Motel. She has a surprise waiting for her there. The plot thickens from here. I will not go into plot detail for those of you who have not viewed the film, but the suspense is uncanny in the way Hitchcock directed the movie.Hitchcock uses music and lighting in a way that draws the audience's full attention and makes the viewers become a part of the film. The suspense in this film is beyond comprehension, in the way that a person has not lived until you have viewed this film. No film of this time has been able to top this suspenseful thriller. The fact that the movie is in black and white makes the film unusually dramatic. Viewers thought Notorious was good, but Psycho is even better. Hitchcock has plenty of surprises and keeps his audience guessing. The dramatic lighting, camera angles, and suspenseful music make Psycho one of his best.If you have seen the 1998 version of this film, it does not do Hitchcock's 1960's version justice. The camera angles and lighting are much better in the 1960 version and keep the audience in suspense throughout. The newer version has dead zones, and the suspense is broken up. The coloring in the later film does not give the audience the feeling of standing in the scene watching what is going on. The acting in the newer film is extremely poor and boring.The 1960's original screenplay, Psycho is almost guaranteed to make you hang onto your chair throughout the movie, even if you are viewing a movie on a cell phone. I would not recommend watching this film alone for sure.Reference: Hitchcock, A. (Director),(1960) Psycho (Motion Picture).",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"""A boy's best friend is his mother.""","PSYCHO is a psychological thriller with elements of horror in which tension is gradually giving way to a sort of creeps. It is based on the novel of the same name by Robert Bloch.During a lunchtime in Phoenix, a real estate secretary discusses with her boyfriend how they cannot afford to get married because of his debts. Forty thousand dollars in cash accidentally come into her hands. This is a great temptation for a young and unhappy woman. Her boss asks her to deposit the money in the bank. She instinctively takes the money and plans an escape to a new life. California is a famous destination of most of the fugitives. She has, because of the strong cuff, decided to spend the night in a small motel. A pleasant dinner with an attentive owner of the motel will be the last in her life...The story is very tense and shocking. It has offered some of iconic climax in the genre. Mr. Hitchcock did not give up from a classical narrative. He has managed, regardless of the situation and the probability to transfer tensions from one character to another. Hitch has paid attention to small details. The secret of the main plot lies in these details.A ghostly atmosphere has completely corresponded with violence, deviant behavior and sexuality. The soundtrack is excellent. All the protagonists are changing throughout the film. It is a kind of trap by Mr. Hitchcock. Compassion and understanding toward one of the antagonists in the film are certainly possible. However, a viewer loses a firm stance with regard to any kind of identification with the main antagonist. We hear a voice of the killer, we know some of his features, we are witnesses of his murder, but we do not see a clear character.Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates has offered an excellent and intriguing performance. The duality in his character has reflected through a family melodrama, violence by parents and a psychotic obsession. His unpredictability and alienation can cause a fear and admiration at the same time.Janet Leigh as Marion Crane is quite convincing in the role of an insecure and nervous woman.Both characters are in strong conflict with themselves. Norman has struggled with obsession and fear. Marion has tried to overcome her own passion and discomfort. He is completely disturbed person, who can not make decisions alone. She is an unfortunate woman who tries to escape from everyday life.The film has become unique in the combination of a sophisticated music and upcoming murder scene. Hitch has, in an intriguing way, played with the human psyche.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Schizophrenic script,"The thrills embodied in this movie make people have to marvel at Hitchcock's grasp of the rhythm and plot of the film, even now few people can reach it. Each suspense point is unexpected, and cleverly, a representative thing will appear in each suspense point to intentionally mislead the audience. Hitchcock deliberately let the audience's eyes stare at the representative things, and in the meantime, constantly creating new waves, so although there is a lot less internal thinking, the audience still feels very exciting.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Nothing less than a perfect 10/10,"Psycho is a masterpiece of suspense and horror that has stood the test of time. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, the film tells the story of Marion Crane, a young woman who steals money from her employer and ends up at the Bates Motel, run by the mysterious Norman Bates.The movie is a perfect example of Hitchcock's mastery of the craft. The film's screenplay, written by Joseph Stefano, is a work of art, filled with twists and turns that keep the audience guessing until the very end. The movie's score, composed by Bernard Herrmann, is also a standout, adding to the film's suspense and tension. Pay particular attention to the film's use of colour and light - although black and white, you'll notice things like Marion wearing white vs. Black at times, which I won't get into for fear of spoilers, and shadows galore.The movie's cast is also excellent. Janet Leigh delivers a standout performance as Marion Crane, while Anthony Perkins is unforgettable as Norman Bates. Un. For. Gettable. The film's supporting cast, including Vera Miles and John Gavin, is also excellent.Overall, Psycho is a movie that is not to be missed.

Honeymoon Hotel It's Not,"The '50s had been something of a success story for Alfred Hitchcock. He had done some great films, with some huge stars. Gary Grant, Ingrid Bergman, James Stewart, Grace Kelly and Henry Fonda had all worked for him. In 1955, he also started ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"", a TV show with millions of viewers. But now it was 1960. The director wanted to try something new.In ""Psycho,"" Anthony Perkins plays a repressed young man named Norman Bates. He seems completely dominated by his disabled mother, but still tries to manage his run-down motel as best he can. One day, an attractive young woman (Janet Leigh) walks through the front door, setting in motion a fateful sequence of events.Unfortunately, Paramount Pictures wasn't interested in the new project. In a desperate attempt to get ""Psycho"" made, Hitchcock offered to pay for the shooting himself if the company guaranteed to distribute the finished film. And ultimately Paramount said yes. Convinced that ""Psycho"" would be a box-office flop they also agreed to Hitchcock's demand for a 60% cut of the film's (unlikely) profit.Hitchcock immediately set to work. To keep costs down, he only used personnel from his own TV series behind the cameras. And he shot the whole movie in black and white on a spare movie set. With a budget of $800,000, ""Psycho"" was the cheapest film Hitchcock ever produced.Surprisingly, the picture became a smash hit at the cinemas. Thanks to his deal with Paramount, Hitchcock personally earned over $15 million from the box office. In the coming years, ""Psycho"" also became a successful franchise with three more new films, as well as a color remake of the original.

Go take a shower!,"Hitchcock's greatest film and, arguably, the most highly regarded horror movie of all time. Janet Leigh's initial appearance, in her bra and slip, was as risque as any mainstream movie could be in 1960. The immorality of Leigh's character is established right off the bat. Well, maybe. Depends on your point of view. The legendary shower scene was brilliant. The ""illusion"" of nudity is all there was. Janet Leigh was very sexy in the two ""bra and slip"" scenes. However, Vera Miles, in my opinion, was even more sexy-and she never even removes her coat! I guess it's the way a woman comes across. As to Anthony Perkins' performance-he was made for the role. I've never thought the ""twist"" ending was so hard to see coming. Only the genius of Hitchcock could have made everything tie together so well.

STANDING OVATION! - (10 stars out of 10),"The stage curtains open ...Alfred Hitchcock has had so many good movies, that I'd be hard pressed to identify one as his masterpiece. But, if I had to choose one, ""Psycho"" would probably have to be it. This is quintessential Hitchcock - without a doubt. I was born 8 years after this film came out, so I didn't have my first experience with ""Psycho"" until much later. Even though it was an older film by then, and it was in black & white, I can tell you that I was afraid to take a shower after I'd seen it!Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), a real estate secretary, is tempted to run away and start a new life with her secret lover, Sam Loomis, when $40,000 practically lands in her lap. She succumbs to her temptation, packs her bag, and hits the road. But when a heavy downpour of rain forces her to pull over for the night, she finds herself off the main road and at Bates Motel, a forgotten corner of the world. Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), the motel's owner, befriends her and they share a dinner together in which she learns of his invalid mother, and his frustration of living with her. It causes her to reflect on her own situation. She makes the decision to return the money, but a little too late as it turns out leading to one of the most suspenseful stories ever told.For the fan of thriller/horror films, this one is a must see. In fact, it is a must own. Everything that made Hitchcock stand out above the rest is present here - his camera work, chilling musical score, strong characters, and a deep plot with an ending you didn't see coming. This is truly a classic that has aged well, and that has spawned three good sequels, and a remake. Norman Bates and his motel have become a cultural icons and have influenced countless writers and filmmakers over the years.

Overrated.,"I eventually got round to watching what is probably the most famous Hitchcock movie and I have to say it was a bit of a let down. While the story is obvious to anyone who hasn't been living as a hermit their entire life, I still should have been able to engage with this movie much better than I did. Its simply not in the same league as something like Rear Window.While the movie does have a few great stand out scenes overall it doesn't have the same grip you come to expect from Hitch. The first act focuses on a woman who rips off her boss to the tune of 40 grand, she's also an adulterer so you obviously don't care for her, but then the movie does a 180 and focuses on Norman Bates. This is quite a jarring switch and seems a very odd choice in terms of narration. I would also argue that the conclusion is a huge let down. There is a minor action scene and then we are subjected to what I can only describe as a psychobabble explanation of why Norman is why he is. But unfortunately its complete nonsense, there is no such thing as a ""split personality"" and the psychiatrists speech is pure bunkum. Had they bothered to write a story about someone with an actual diagnosable DSM/ICD illness and write the story around that, then sure. But to basically invent a mental illness and have some pretend psychiatrist take up the final act talking nonsense is unforgivable. While I am sure it may impress some people who have no clue about mental health, the Norman Bates case is laughable to anyone who knows about mental health.The pros of this movie are the cinematography and a couple of stand out scenes. The negatives are the entirely fictitious mental health issues and the ropey script. This isn't an 8.5 out of 10 movie, it's not even an 8.5 in terms of Hitchcock. Its a just above average thriller that is unlikely to shock or thrill the way it may have in the 60's.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

It's frightening that our psychology is so fragile.,"Everyone needs love, respect and acceptance from others, and once this requirement is not met, the mind will be distorted and people will go to the opposite side. Many psychologists believe that being loved is a basic need, and that the ability to love is one of the criteria by which a normal person can judge. This is important in Freud's and Rogers's teachings. Rogers believes that we all have a natural need to be accepted and respected, and that when the satisfaction of such a request is conditioned, it often causes us to involuntarily meet such conditions in order to maintain the respect of important others. At this time, we tend to see ourselves and act from the perspective of others, and instead of listening to the guidance of our own inner experience, we become more and more a product of social consciousness, and this is the origin of various mental diseases.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

One of the Best Films of All Time ***** out of 5,"This is film-making at it's absolute best.Bernard Herrman's score is terrific and will stick in your head forever. Anthony Perkin's and Janet Leigh's performances seem truly genuine and real all the way through. The shower scene is undoubtedly the most memorable horror moment in film history. There's something about that scene that makes it hard to watch even to this day. Notice when 'Mother' opens the shower curtain how you can just barely make out the eyes that stare so coldly at Leigh before the knife comes down on her. And the brief moment where we see 'Mother' leave the bathroom. The entire scene is just masterful. It never gets old, never will. It will remain the definitive piece of film-making and will remain the granddaddy of all horror pictures.On another note, Psycho II and III are actually worth watching, despite what some people may say. They aren't the masterpiece that the original is of course but the filmmakers wisely don't try to duplicate it. They are very different stories from the original. They are a (especially Part II) quite intelligent continuation of the character Norman Bates. If you are interested in seeing what happens to Norman in the years to come, they are indispensable.As for the remake... I'm not sure it's worth mentioning. As a movie, it stinks because it's already been done, and it just proved that the original can't be beat. Then again, I've heard it should be just looked at as a tribute. But what raunchy way to pay tribute to the greatest horror film of all time.So, in closing, let me say that if you haven't seen Hitchcock's masterpiece, go now and buy it.

THE horror film!,"Psycho is THE ultimate horror movie. What a brilliantly told story and equally powerful acting from all concerned. This movie details the aspects of shock and the macabre to chilling effect, and surely scared the wits out of cinema-goers back in 1960! Of course back then, a gruesome murder wasn't really seen on film before, not such a gruesome killing anyway, but it's highly common today. Hitchcock delivers a heart-stopping, gripping movie which doesn't let down for a single second. It's much better that the film was released in black and white; had it had been in colour, the fear and suspense may have been lost to some effect.Janet Leigh portrayed Marion Crane with wonderful agility, but we all know the real star of the show was (and is) Anthony Perkins. Norman Bates is probably the most twisted and scariest characters in the history of film, and Perkins delivers the vulnerabilities we see in Bates to stunning effect. I have huge respect for Vera Miles, and she was also well cast as Marion's concerned sister, Lila. A very underrated actress.The suspense to Psycho starts right from the word go, what with the extremely haunting music to the opening titles, which continues in certain scenes throughout the film. An equally powerful and shocking ending too...Psycho is simply the ultimate horror movie, it hasn't been bettered, and cannot be bettered.

Simply the Best Mystery Movie of All Time,"There are rarely any movies that revolutionize a whole genre. Hitchcock's Psycho is undoubtedly one such movie.

The acting is outclass with special reference being to Anthony Perkins, the stammering motel manager and of course Vera Miles (also John Gavins acting for me). Hitchcock brings out his best direction techniques and methods in this movie. Everything about this movie just stands out, its cinematography, acting, direction, story telling.. just everything. The plot, though simple, is created with so much suspense that you'll be submerged into the movie. The climax may well be the best we have ever seen (not even comparable to climax in The Usual Suspects). For the climax alone i would rank the movie 10/10.

Whats all the fuss about,"Whats the fuss about the movie anyways? I guess in it's it may have been a hit but when i saw it last year (2004) I was not impressed.

Its a good movie but not sure why its considered a ""timeless classic"".My Dad was full of praise before we even started watching it. There was this last scene where it was meant to be ""all revealed"". I kind of guessed that Norman's mom was dead earlier and again it wasn't scary. I don't find skeletons and corpses on screen scary but then maybe its me coz I never am scared at the movies.The movie is basically good. Well directed, well acted and for its time it must have been technically sound too. But a classic? This seems a case of nostalgia and faddishness taking over in judging a movie than the movie itself.

Pure Cinema,"The hardest movies to review are the accepted classics. What can be said that hasn't already been said? And how can I write a glowing review that offers up genuine love and appreciation for the film, and not just regurgitate some propaganda that Psycho is the greatest slasher ever made? Well, here goes nothing . . .From imitation and its popularity among film scholars and horror buffs, Psycho has no more surprises left  that's a given. However, Sir Alfred Hitchcock foresaw this problem and infused Psycho (as well as his other pictures) with the more effective element: suspense. We know where, why, and when the murders take place. So what? The key to Hitchcock's famous bomb analogy is that suspense comes from the audience's knowledge of the bomb, not a lack of knowledge. We know, but the characters do not. That's suspense.I watched Psycho again just recently, and felt an unprecedented excitement as those famous Bernard Herrmann strings began playing and Saul Bass' credits filled the screen. I was watching one of my favorite movies again, and I couldn't wait to dive into the film, itself. I couldn't wait for that opening shot of Phoenix  I looked forward to seeing that look of horror on Marion Crane's face as her bosses crosses the street in front of her car while she's escaping to Fairvale. I wanted to see Anthony Perkins to appear on screen with his brilliantly subdued performance of Norman Bates, and I leaned closer to the screen and smiled when he says, ""We all go a little crazy sometimes.""Needless to say, I love this movie.What amazes me about Psycho, and I didn't consciously realize this until reading the Truffaut book ""Hitchcock"", is how the film manages to smoothly switch protagonists midway through the film (from Marion to Norman). As Hitchcock and Truffaut talk in the book, when the car is pushed into the swamp and it stops  the audience's heart stops. We want the car to sink, and we want Norman to succeed. More amazingly is how even after knowing all the revelations the film has to offer  the truth about Norman Bates and his mother  we still want that car to sink. We still sympathize with Norman Bates in that moment.That, in my opinion, is what truly separates Hitchcock's Psycho from the pack. Sir Alfred actually made us care about his killer. I can't think of any other slasher film that attempts this and succeeds. Most slashers are content to have a killing machine under a mask, but only Hitchcock has the balls to show us the face of his killer. Only Hitchcock would dare to make his killer a full-fledged characters with intelligent thoughts and complex emotions, and only Hitchcock was good enough to pull it off.As if that's not enough, in the final act Hitch plays the audience like an organ and switches our sympathies once again (from Norman to Lila)  and all the while, the audience never really consciously recognizes that their loyalties fly from character to character on a whim. We want Marion to succeed because the man she's stealing from is a prick, we want Norman to succeed because of the love for his mother and his humanness in reacting to the murder, and we want Lila to succeed because we want to know the truth behind Norman Bates' mother.One of my favorite moments in all of cinema occurs in Psycho. Watch the film while Sam Loomis is searching and calling out for Detective Arbogast at the Bates' motel. Then Hitch cuts to a slow fluid push in on Anthony Perkins at the swamp, and Perkins looks up at the camera with a mixture of emotions in his eyes. It's one of the simplest camera movements in the film. Perkins doesn't say a word - he just quietly looks on. Yet it's one of the most effective shots in the entire film. A simple movement and silent look is all Hitchcock needs.When the marketing gimmicks have all been forgotten, when all the surprises are known, and when imitators have sucked away and blatantly stolen whatever they can get to work for 45 years, Psycho still stands as solid as ever. It did not need the shock of killing its star, nor did it need the shocking revelation at the end, it didn't need the gimmick that ""audiences won't be admitted after the start of the picture."" Psycho works just as well without them because Hitchcock delivered great characters played by competent actors, and he let the audience know there's a bomb waiting to go off that none of those characters know about.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The original slasher villain,"There's a lot to say about Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960). For one thing, it would not have lit the fuse to the explosion of other unique slasher villains that everyone comes to know and enjoy at the movies. As crazy as this idea was back in the day, Hitchcock was able to push the boundaries of suspense and create a legend that practically no one can forget. Thankfully everything here is put together in such a way that it amounts to a very clever, creepy and disturbing movie.The story is about a girl named Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) who is given a huge sum of money and is expected to deposit in the bank. However, she becomes greedy and decides to run off with it. While on her escape, she decides to rest at an old motel owned by a man named Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). There she learns that Norman is under the strict rule of his mother and that he's a slight bit unsettling. However, she doesn't realize how unsettling Norman really is. Co-starring Perkins and Leigh are several other veteran actors like Vera Miles, John Gavin, Martin Balsam and John McIntire.The writing is based off of Robert Bloch's work of the same name. Bloch himself had based it off of the disturbing real story of Ed Gein of Plainfield Wisconsin in 1957. What's great though is that Hitchcock kept everything identical to the book. Every scene that is depicted gives momentum to the plot and helps make the tension that much more gripping. The best actor here is Anthony Perkins. Not only are his reactions real but also feel genuine. For example, when telling a lie and then being found out, he tries to cover his tracks. He is able to do so but speaks nervously.As for the year, 1960 had some graphic violence come into play. Not enough to shock anyone, but creative enough to let the audiences' imagination run wild. Also, just because the film is in black and white doesn't mean for any viewer who doesn't like the ""old"" films, can't be entertained either. With the simplicity of color, there are other things for the viewer to watch and notice. Having only black and white actually simplifies the viewing experience for the audience. Accompanying that is Bernard Herrmann's all string score, with one of the most iconic tunes taking place in a shower scene. If you want to know where slasher films began, it's here.Norman Bates is the original slasher villain. Audiences will be clinging to the disturbing story, the acting is great and the music is memorable.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

One of Hitchcock's best movies.,"Psycho is one of the best classics you'll ever see.It's directed by the Master of Suspense himself, Hitchcock.Psycho is about a woman who has stolen some money and kept driving till she got to a small motel, the ""Bates Motel"".There she met Norman the owner of the place. Norman is what you would call a momma's boy cause he still lives with his mother who lives in an large old house on the hill behind the motel.You don't get to see the mother yet. And you'll find out why later.But when the woman who check into the motel starts taking a shower, you're about see some twisted stuff.Psycho is a very cool movie. If you like old school thriller movies, then I highly recommend seeing this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"""A boy's best friend is his mother.""","I will do my best to relate to you a good review of this film, while not giving away all the juicy details that make this film one of the best films ever made. All I can say is wow and Alfred Hitchcock shows us why he is one of the greatest filmmakers to ever live with this low-budget 1960 shocker.The beautiful Janet Leigh (whose daughter happens to be Jamie Lee Curtis) plays Marion Crane who is dealing with a boyfriend (John Gavin) whose in need of cash and also the desire to marry this man. Crane is a real-estate secretary and a huge purchase is made in cash. Her job is to take the $40,000 to the bank on her way home. Thing is Marion decides to take the money and drive to her boyfriend in Fairvale. Before she gets there she decides to stop at the Bates Motel for the night. There she meets Norman Bates (amazingly played by Anthony Perkins) and this is where this truly great film gets even better.Janet Leigh garnered an Oscar nomination for her role which she richly deserved as I thought she does an amazing job really in caring the first half an hour of the film as we follow her and only her. The fact that Anthony Perkins did not even receive an Oscar nomination for his multi-layered in-depth portrayal of Norman Bates is beyond mind-blowing to me.The music as well by Bernard Hermann is truly one of the greatest not only in the history of horror, but of all-time films. It has been ripped off, attempted to be duplicated a number of times, but when you hear others be inspired by it you can tell exactly where the music is coming from.Screenplay by Joseph Stefano from a novel (which I have read and did enjoy) by Robert Bloch. Also starring Vera Miles as Marion's sister Lila, Martin Balsam as Arbogast, Simon Oakland as Dr. Richman and look fast for Ted Knight right near the end of the film.In my all-time list of greatest horror films this masterpiece stands only behind Stanley Kubrick's THE SHINING in my mind. There is so much to look at and dissect and go over in your mind. Probably the most influential horror film of all time.Followed by three sequels (all of which were never equal to the original), a TV movie, a yucky shot-for-shot remake and a TV show.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Good movie,"Music was so funny back in 60 😄 and it was very expected scenes

This Puppy Did Not Age Well. Plenty of Manufactured (too long) Drama...,"""Psycho"" was definitely a decent film, no surprise as it was made by the great Hitchcock at the top of his game. But the film was just too predictable and had too many laughs where they were not supposed to be.I mean seriously. I can't speak for the crowds in 1960, but if anyone watches this for the first time today, it's pretty obvious where this entire picture is going after we go to the motel for the first time. The title itself is clue enough (he's a ""psycho"" after all) but really, I can't see anyone not guessing the big 'secret' of this flick way before the ending.The film's main characters are cast superbly. Janet Leigh looks great and sexy, keeping the film from being too boring because she's so beautiful and good on screen. And of course Anthony Perkins does a pretty decent job. He doesn't give the awe-inspiring heart-stopping performance that fans of the flick seem to think he gives, but he is very good indeed.The ingredients of the movie are put together very nicely, with the music and editing utilized for the maximum effect. Hitchcock definitely shows why he's known as such a great talent in these respects, putting it all together beautifully.Unfortunately, the film suffers from too many laughs where they aren't supposed to be. When Norman first indicated he's a little ""psycho,"" it's very funny watching him and his serious face as he gives clues he's such a nut case. With ""Mother,"" whenever ""she"" talks (and yells), it's just too funny not to laugh at it. Even the scene when Norman carries ""Mother"" form her room is funny, as she talks her nonsense as he carries her out with her legs dangling.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Hitchcock's masterpiece is the greatest thriller of all time.,"Psycho is a movie with an incredible twist-turned plot that throws the audience's perspective of the film way out of proportion. It is Hitchcock's best, without a doubt. His nervous and jittery Norman Bates is outstanding. If you can guess the ending of this timeless classic, you are considered a genius in my opinion. I have watched this movie a number of times and still find it enjoyable to watch again and again, I also learn something new about the film every time I view it. Look for the various mentions of birds in the film (i.e. Marion Crane, stuffed birds). It is not a scary movie, so don't expect to be terrified of showers or of hotels-maybe this wasn't the case in 1960 though when the movie came out. It is more a thriller or a mystery, one that will still seem unsolved after you learn ""who done it"". #4 on my all time favorite list. It is excellence, 4 stars. -Jake Klim (jklim007@yahoo.com)",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Great Watch,"Lately I have been watching older movies. I thing I noticed is how much I enjoyed the dialogues. Well written and well spoken. Psycho is nothing different. Enjoyable dialogue and flow throughout the movie.Amazing amazing amazing amazing performance by Anthony Perkins. Enjoyed every single minute he was on because he really immersed himself in the role and did a marvelous job. Even the character he portrayed really disturbing and suited him.A little slow paced for my liking but it's a thriller and didn't feel bored at all. A lot of nerve wrecking scenes especially as Alfred Hitchcock used a lot scoring and music in this movie. It felt at one point that every second there was sound effects.Amazing acting by everyone, Directing/Cinematography by the Legend Hitchcock, and scoring.Great watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
a supreme classic,"""Psycho"" is the kind of movie that you really have to make sure that you see if you're going to be the kind of people who want to talk about the history of Hollywood movies. Like some others, Mr. Hitchcock produced or directed quite a few famous films. The basic idea in this one is to tell the story of the strange things that happen after a woman checks in at a spooky old motel. In a way, many might claim that this movie by itself could show you that Mr. Hitchcock belongs having a reputation for doing the very highest quality work, but I'd especially recommend ""The Birds"" if you just can't resist a little more scary stuff.

its quite good a watch,"Psycho English, 1960 Genre: Horror, Mystery, Thriller Direction: Alfred Hitchcock Cast: Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles, Janet Leigh, Martin Balsam, John Gavin IMDb: 8.6/10A movie is called a classic when the story it tells still remains valid even years after it was released. In that sense, master director Alfred Hitchcock's psychological thriller is very easily a classic. What starts seemingly as a satire on human behavior, quite unexpectedly changes gears and becomes a crime thriller. There are moments where one actually holds his breath. The plot goes like this: A Phoenix secretary steals $40,000 from her employer's client, goes on the run and checks into a remote motel run by a young man under the domination of his mother. The story initially revolves around this secretary, Marion (Janet Leigh), but drifts after some point of time. I won't discuss too much about the story in my reviews as I myself hate to know the story of a movie before watching it. The background music is quite fitting. Psycho's definitely worth your 1 hour and 48 minutes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Greatly overestimated,"This film is very overestimated just as so many other film-classics. It's certainly not a bad film but it's not worth the high ranking. Maybe Hitchcock was a pioneer in his genre and important for future horror-film-directors. But this is not a reason to still love the film. Also worth mentioning is the acting (not realistic) and the technical aspects (the photography isn't that good) which for their time of course wasn't that bad, but compared to, for ex. ""The Shining"" (#87 in the IMDB top 250) is lousy. In the end the film isn't that scary. I recommend ""Dark Water"" (or ""Honogurai mizu no soko kara"") by Hideo Nakata if you want something scary. Maybe Hitchcock WAS a genius, but his films are outdated like Jesse Owens world-records.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of Hitchcock's best films...a masterpiece!!! score: 9 (out of 10),"No one on Earth has captured the art of ""horror"" or ""suspense"" on film better than Alfred Hitchcock.  His three best films that come to my mind are ""Vertigo"" (1958), ""North by Northwest"" (1959) and this one...his all-time greatest masterpiece, although some people think ""Lifeboat"" (1944) is his finest film to date.  I can remember when I first saw this film...my friend's mother refused to let her son watch such a stupid, slasher film.  I laughed.  This is not a typical ""slasher"" film, but a story about embezzlement, greed, adultery, and murder...all of the ingredients that make up a Hitchcock movie. The ""Friday the 13th"" movies are what make up a typical ""slasher"" movie simply because there is no plot other than the constant ""slashing"" of people.  This Hitchcock movie has a plot, of which I am not going to go into a lot of detail.  After devising a scheme to embezzle her boss out of a chunk of money, Marion Crane winds up fleeing town, and her job, for her lover (John Gavin).  During a terrible rain storm, she finds vacancy in the Bates Motel, which is run by the shy and innocent Norman Bates.  What I found so interesting about this movie is the pace, the tone, the timing, the music, the house where Norman lives, and the confines of a simple motel room, and of course, the shower...all of which lead to murder and mayhem in a stylish, provocative manner.  Roger Ebert's review of the movie is correct...at the end...the shrink's description of Norman is dull and overblown.  If Hitch could have tightened that scene up just a bit...the film could have been totally flawless.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Unbelievablely Great!,"I don't know how to explain this but this movie is by far the 'Greatest Movie I've Ever Seen'. I mean a movie that plays with your mind for almost 2 hours.

Anthony Perkins smashed it as Norman Bates and became 'One of the Scariest Villains who Ever graced the Cinema'. Alfred Hitchcock did the best in every aspect to make this movie, one of the Greatest.A movie that transcends the limits of time and became Immortal for fans, critics and the upcoming film makers. No one can ever make a horror thriller ever close to its caliber.Don't get fooled by its time of release. It is still the Best movie today.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
An Important Film to Cinema History,"This film I have fond memories of. My mother showed it to me when I was growing up and despite my not liking black and white films then, I enjoyed this one quite a bit. I thought the twist was absolutely amazing and the cultural significance of this film is immense. I've seen his movie many times throughout the years, with the last few times in the theater. I even took Jaime, as she had never seen this version as well. The official synopsis is a Phoenix secretary embezzles $40,000 from her employer's client, goes on the run and checks into a remote motel run by a young man under the domination of his mother.We kick off this one with a couple in a motel room. The woman is Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) and her lover is Sam Loomis (John Gavin). They meet up here because they aren't married. Sam loves her, but he is divorced and has a lot of debts. Marion loves him and wants to marry. She is getting frustrated with their relationship. She just wants to be with him. This is an interesting dynamic for the time period.That is when something pops up that could help their situation. Her boss brings in a client that is trying to buy a house for his daughter and comes in with $40,000 in cash. Marion is asked to take it to the bank. She inquires if she can go home afterwards due to a headache. What she really does is heads home, packs and tries to flee. Her boss sees her in the car though or at least he thinks he does.What I really like about the next sequence is that Marion is hearing the voices of everyone back in Phoenix. She is thinking about what is probably happening, even though she has until Monday to get away, as these events happened on a Friday. I like this, because this is exactly what I do about a lot of situations in my life. I will play them in my head for all possible scenarios, your normal overthinker. It does seem these are the exact conversations that are being had as well.Marion has a run-in with a highway patrol officer and this causes her to trade in her car and buy a used one. She then plays out what happens there in head as well. She doesn't make things easier as she comes off very suspicious. She is vague in her answers and she does things that are highly unusual.It starts to rain so she pulls off to a motel. It turns out to be the Bates Motel and she meets with the proprietor, Norman (Anthony Perkins). They get along pretty well and it is clear that he is attracted to her. There is an issue that arises with his mother and him not giving her dinner. This all leads to the infamous shower scene.Something that I didn't notice in my previous viewings of this film is that Marion changes her mind about what she is trying to do after she speaks with Norman. This makes what happens to her effect me even more, because she is going to try to do the right thing despite what she did. I also want to comment on the impact of what happens to her as well. Most of us already know the twist here, heck I believe there are a lot of people who know this scene without even seeing this film. This is iconic, because it changes cinema and influences great films like Scream.When Marion goes missing, her sister Lila (Vera Miles) seeks out Sam and so does Milton Arbogast (Martin Balsam), a private detective who is searching out the stolen money. This all leads everyone back to the Bates Motel and to learn the truth about Norman and his mother.The issues with Norman are also interesting. It isn't the textbook definition of split personalities, as they can talk to each other. The final images we see in the fruit cellar end up influencing films going forward like Dressed to Kill.Acting in this film is also quite amazing. Perkins is perfect as Norman. The novel has him overweight and kind of greasy looking. This film makes it unnerving that he has the boy next door looks and he seems quite harmless. Knowing what he is capable of though makes it that much scarier. Miles and Gavin are solid as the two who are trying to figure out what happened to Marion. Leigh is amazing and what happens to her is iconic for cinema to come. The rest of the cast round out the film very well for what was needed also.Runtime on the film is 109 minutes, but it doesn't feel like it. We move through the plot points at a good clip. I even thought it was interesting that I knew the outcome of the mystery, but this time around I was focusing more on things that I didn't notice in previous viewings of the film. The only thing that I didn't like is the psychologist who is explaining Norman and his psyche. I don't mind it to an extent, but I think it goes too far. It is interesting getting in giallo films, as they took this concept along with villains across genres. The final image of Norman is great as is the actual reveal as well.As for the effects, there aren't a lot of them. A lot of this goes to the time period and what they could show. The shower scene is amazing though. We never actually see the knife penetrating due to the great editing, but we feel like we see it. The blood is good in that the water is washing some of it away and the splatters look realistic. The final image of the film has a cool effect that I had never noticed until these later viewings. The film is also shot amazing. I come to expect that from an Alfred Hitchcock film though.Something that really helps make this film feel eerie is the Bernard Herrmann's score. I actually listen to this one when I'm writing, because the music sets the perfect mood. There are some scenes that aren't even scary as to what we are seeing, but the music gives it such an unnerving feeling that it gets my anxiety going. The music cues during the shower scene are also iconic.Now with that said, this film is a classic. It is important film for many genres. It helped to spark the slasher films that could come a couple decades later. There is the issue of man being the monster and mental illness. It is shocking what it does with a popular actress like Leigh and quite iconic as well. The rest of the acting is great as is the story overall. There's not a lot in the way of effects, but what is used are great as is how the film is directed. The score also definitely helps this film and is also quite amazing. If you've never seen this classic, I recommend giving it a viewing. Even if you know what the reveal is, it is fun to try to pick out things to reinforce it. This film is very near perfect.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

First, we suspect Marion Crane, then the ominous cop, and so on, as Hitchcock masterfully leads us down one false trail after another.

Quite possibly the greatest film of all time!,"""Psycho"" stands alone in the realm of horror and thriller movies. It is one of the few that delivers to fear and feeling into the misbegotten souls of it's characters. Director Alfred Hitchcock delivers superb direction and forces you to put your trust in ""Psycho""'s many seedy characters. Anthony Perkins delivers the performance of a lifetime as Norman Bates, the poor pawn of his 'mother'. The film, brilliantly shot in B&W, has become a staple in any movie lover's eye. The entire story revolves around the theft of 400,000 by one Marion Crane(Janet Leigh). This theft entangles her sister(Vera Miles), her lover(John Gavin), a private eye(Martin Balsam), a sheriff(John McIntire), and a lonely hotel manager(Perkins). ""Psycho"" is capable of being rewatched over and over again with little secrets hidden through out. Each character holds some secret: Marion stole some money, Gavin is seeing her on the side, Marion's coworker took tranquilers on her wedding night, her boss has alcohol in the office, client holds undeclared money from the IRS, and Norman has the biggest sequel of all. ""Psycho"" also contains the greatest score of all time which contains only strings which was wonderfully composed by the late Bernard Hermann as well as the best directed scene of all time, the infamous shower scene.

Classic Hitchcock,"Absconding with $40,000 of her boss's money, Marion Crane sets off to join her lover Sam Loomis. After a tiring journey through the rain, she stops at a lonely motel run by Norman Bates , an intense young man living in the remote house with his domineering mother...Psycho is a magnificent spine-chiller, considered one of Hitchcock's greatest films, in which he develops new heights of suspense and psychological terror, and features a terrifying performance by Anthony Perkins, who plays Norman Bates, the owner of the Bates motel. He's innocent, charming, then is twitching with annoyance. The last scene of him is spine-chilling with the camera zooming close to his face. And speaking of camera angles, Hitchcock utilises this technique well, adding to the claustrophobic tension. The close attention to detail is superb - the sense of dread well played - of course all helped by the spinechilling music.Of course, Psycho is famous for that shower scene, which is really frightening , mainly because the victim is contained in a small space, vulnerable - and you see how helpless Janet Leigh's character is. Her acting is superb. In an interview she had mentioned how she's scared to look at that scene.The rest of the cast - including Martin Balsam, Vera Miles and John Gavin - is great, but of course Perkins steals the scene easily.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Anthony Perkins' performance as Norman Bates is one of the greatest performances ever and he makes Bates such a spooky and memorable character.Many may think the most frightening in Psycho is the famous shower scene, but that ending scene where Norman Bates gives a smile to the camera is truly haunting and unforgettable.Psycho has some of the best cinematography i've ever seen, the camera angles and cuts makes every scene extremely unique and interesting.

I have watched this week both the original 1960 and the 1998 remake for the first time.This movie is overrated. Anthony Perkins did a great job, but the rest of the characters were horribly acted.The story is good, audio line matches harmoniously. But the movie is very slow It could have used some pace. Even Considering it was made in 1960.It isn't as good as its reputation. Psycho surely builds the base of horror movies, but certainly it's not the best one. The remake is slightly better (much better acting especially from Heche compared with Janet Leigh), so if you haven't watch both, i would recommend the latter....",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The best of the best,"""Psycho"" is one of the few horror movies that have actually scared me.  Even against such movies as ""The Exorcist"" and ""Poltergeist"", this one is the best of the best.Even for a film shot in 1960 and entirely in black and white, the movie's lighting and cinematography are brilliant.  This film invented shots that are used today and some that lesser-skilled directors just don't know how to use.  (The contrast of Detective Arbogast against the house as he walks up the steps.)The shower scene was good, but some other scenes were even better.

Classic,"Nowadays Psycho might be seen as a not so special movie because most people know the famous plot twist even without watching it. But when it was released it was very inovative,serial killer movies weren't as popular in the 60's as they were in the late 70's and 80's. Psycho gave birth to the slasher genre,Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Halloween in the late 70's, Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on elm Street in the 80's,all these titles were heavly influenced by Psycho.

Psycho(1960),"Timeless Chills
The concept, based on the 1959 novel by Robert Bloch, is elemental. A woman flees a bad decision, and lands in the lair of a predator who is falling deep into his own psychosis. By the time he made PSYCHO, Hitchcock had directed dozens of films. He was acknowledged as the Master of Suspense, with the capital letters in that honorary title always implied in conversation. Hitchcock knew exactly how to construct a scene to evoke and exploit specific feelings. His style on PSYCHO was brisk and economical, and could be exceptionally brutal.Nowhere is that more apparent than in the murder of Marian Crane, played by the film's lone marquee movie star, Janet Leigh. No one going into PSYCHO expected Leigh's character to be killed off halfway through the movie, much less for it to happen in a dramatic and shattering sequence. The screeching strings and deep notes of the score by composer Bernard Herman turned the shower scene into a grueling horror showcase and sealed the movie's first major murder as a cinematic all-timer. The scene is created with such great skill that it has power even today, even after being endlessly homaged, parodied, replicated and ripped off. The shower scene lasts all of three minutes, but that 180 seconds echoes through decades of cinema.All Stripped Down
PSYCHO is entrenched as part of movie culture now, but its future was far from certain in 1960. Maybe you think of PSYCHO as an ""old movie"" (it is!), which makes its black and white aesthetic seem entirely appropriate. At the time, however, color was the norm for movies, especially for big pictures like those made by Alfred Hitchcock. His last movie before PSYCHO was NORTH BY NORTHWEST, a splashy caper starring Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint. A hard-edged black and white thriller was an abrupt deviation from expectations.Paramount didn't want to make PSYCHO, so Hitchcock paid for it himself and produced it on the cheap. That meant using his ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" production crew. Another money saving measure was the use of black and white film. All in all, PSYCHO cost under a million bucks; it was a fast, no-frills affair.A useful side benefit of shooting in black and white was that it helped hide some of the movie's gore. In 1960, Hollywood studios were still loosely bound by the fast-withering constraints of the production code. For decades, the production code had specified content seen as inappropriate for Hollywood movies. Explicit sex and violence were forbidden, and even implied content was strictly controlled. But the production code was on the way to obsolescence, and PSYCHO - which became a hit in part because of its shocking content - helped usher it out the door. No one had ever seen a movie like PSYCHO from Alford Hitchcock, or from any other major filmmaker working with an American studio.No Spoilers... or Else!Movie audiences now are averse to spoilers in a way that is fairly different from the norm in 1960, when it wasn't uncommon for ticket-buyers to walk into a movie at any point during the running time, then sit through a program of a feature or two and multiple shorts. Hitchcock's well-documented flair for publicity, combined with exceptional word-of-mouth, helped turn PSYCHO into a bona fide hit.As specified by the director, PSYCHO was promoted with a forbidding warning: No one would be admitted to the theatre after the movie began. Rather than turning audiences off from the movie, that stipulation created interest, and lines, and an ever-expanding audience.A Horrific Legacy
PSYCHO led to sequels (two of which are surprisingly good), an eyebrow-raising shot-for-shot remake by Gus Van Sant (which is an oddly compelling experiment) and a five-season television prequel series, ""Bates Motel."" Those are just the direct descendents of the movie; the entire slasher genre owes a debt to Hitchcock, just as horror movies in general enjoy a popularity that might not be quite the same without this benchmark-setting shocker.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Still Amazing After All These Years,"Being an avid movie fan, I have seen too many motion pictures to even bother trying to count. I love all types: drama, comedy, action, sci-fi, foreign and horror. But I would have to say that my favorite genre is suspense. Something about thrilling audiences without the use of special effects, and creating realistic settings which cause a sense of dread for the audience. And nobody, in my opinion, accomplished this with a greater sense of style, polish, and dignity than Alfred Hitchcock. His films are full of great dialog, well-rounded characters, and genuine and original shocks.Of all of his films, my favorite would have to be ""Psycho"". This masterpiece uses amazing black and white cinematography and a very low bodycount (yes, that's correct, a very low bodycount) to weave a fascinating story of a woman caught in a criminal web of her own doing who stops off at the wrong motel on a wet and rainy night. She meets the inn-keeper, a fragile and soft spoken young man who is emotionally and verbally pushed around by his overbearing mother.What follows is a tension filled and horrifying tale of psychological suspense. I have heard others comment that this film is not really ""scary"", and I beg to differ. Nothing to me could be more terrifying than the reality that people like some of those presented in this film truly exist in our world. It takes a lot more than fake blood and overly-gory special effects to impress me, and the sad thing is that today's ""horror"" films and even some claiming to be suspense films rely too much on the supernatural or just plain disgusting to achieve their affect. None of that for me thanks.One of my true pleasures is to see someone view this film for the first time. Moments in the film tend to shock or surprise people who think they've seen it all. Those who have seen enough knock-offs (and there are a TON of them) may figure out some of the story's plot before it is revealed, but only because so many films have shamelessly ripped this one off. See it for the first time (and even a tenth) and enjoy a master director at the peak of his craft.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"A classic in chills and creepiness, nuf said","Marion (Janet Leigh) works for a real estate agent and earns, most likely, very little bucks in the late fifties. She loves a handsome gentleman named Sam (John Gavin) but, alas, his divorce has left his prospects dim, as a good deal of his money goes to his ex-wife. In fact, he lives in another California town, behind the hardware store he runs. Marion is getting tired of meeting Sam in cheap hotels and listening to his weak promises. One day, a crooked businessman comes in with $40,000 cash for a house he is buying for his daughter, who is marrying soon. Marion's boss is aghast to hold this much money so he sends Marion to the bank on a Friday afternoon. The money never gets deposited. Going a bit ""crazy"", Marion takes the cash and runs north, thinking this will allow Sam to marry her. But, a heavy downpour makes Marion stop at an out-of-the-way motel, The Bates. Greeted by the motel's owner, Norman ( a superb Anthony Perkins), Marion soon learns she is the only guest and is given the best room. Norman even brings her a meal, over the objections of his mother, who Marion sees in a window and hears from the 'big house"" behind the motel. After she eats, Marion decides maybe she should take the money back in the morning and steps into the shower. Suddenly and ghastly, Marion is stabbed to death by, its assumed, Norman's mother. Norman cleans the place up and sinks Marion's car, along with the money, into a pond near the motel. All too soon, Sam and Marion's sister Lila (Vera Miles) are looking for her. A private eye goes snooping, too, hired by the man with the bucks, for he can't notify the police. When the PI gets to the Bates, Norman's mother makes short work of him, too. Another car goes swimming and sinks. But, when Sam and Lila likewise trail Marion to the Bates, will more deaths ensue? Is there bigger secrets afoot? You bet! This classic tale of a psychosis and murder is rightly one of Hitchcock's most famous films. DEFINITELY SCARIER THAN SCARY, many folks never take a shower again after viewing it.

Psycho Review,"Never seeing this film or any other work of Alfred Hitchcock, I was intrigued to see what many people loved about him. There is just something different about him, but in a good way. First of all, Psycho was released in 1960 in black and white. At this point in film history, almost every single movie that was released was in color and watching this film definitely gave it the feeling of a film released in the 1930s-40s. The shower murder scene is one of the most famous scenes in film history and is definitely worth noting. Never seeing the scene in its entirety, I wasn't sure what to expect. Originally I was a little bit disappointed in the realism of the scene but after further analysis, I realized that Hitchcock might have done this on purpose just to fit his mold of uniqueness. Overall, I was a fan of the film as the suspense seemed to build tremendously behind a very creepy character of Norman Bates. I'm not sure if I would call myself a huge Alfred Hitchcock fan but his work is certainly unique.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Masterpiece,"Is Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho a masterpiece? In short yes, and is one movie to define a genre for decades.Psycho is the story of a young woman running from a bad decision.

Norman lives alone with only his mother, a mentally disturbed woman. This simple story will progress into one of the most thrilling films of the twentieth century.Alfred Hitchcock directs this terrifying tale with expertise; no detail is left to wonder with all credit due to this monumental director. The script is also top notch with every scene feeling unique and engrossing. I have to say there is one scene in particular that will forever haunt my imagination.

Overrated Slasher Relic!,"Psycho (and Alfred Hitchcock movies in general) is one of the most overrated films in cinematic history. First off this has nothing to do with any distaste for ""old"" or ""black and white"" movies, as I very rarely watch anything post-1980. But this movie is just really boring. Maybe it's because it is so iconic that any scenes that are supposed to be scary have been burned into pop culture, thereby dulling its power. The first half of the movie, while slow, held my interest enough but once the main character is killed off, I found the movie unbearable to sit through. Yes I understand that this film was a trendsetter as far as slasher flicks go, but I think a real good movie will draw in and hold its audience's interest just as much as time goes on - and Psycho does not! At least not mine. If its place in horror film history is really the only selling point for this flick then it really should be in a museum and not on your television. The Hammer Films, Friday the 13th, Halloween, Val Lewton's films, Black Sunday, The Exorcist - now those are movies that have stood the test of time and retained their entertainment value and fright factor.

The Greatest Horror Film Ever Made?,"October 3 2000Psycho is considered a cult classic and it is directed by Alfred Hitchcock and this is without a doubt his most renowned film. I saw it for the first time today and I understand all the praise it receives, it's the definition of a perfect horror film.Psycho tells a simple story of a woman who is going rogue with 40,000 dollars in her pocket. When she's in her car, rain starts pouring so she inevitably decides to stop at a tiny and secluded motel. Little does she know that the owner is a crazed psychopath.Filming Psycho in black and white only helps the movie become the cult classic it has turned out to be today, imagine watching the shower scene without the B&W filter, it definitely wouldn't have the same effect. And it doesn't just help certain iconic scenes, it makes the whole movie feel ominous and very sinister. The characters are just remarkable and the most memorable of them all is Norman Bates. It's exciting to delve into this character's hidden psychotic personality. Throughout the movie's runtime he is almost winking at us, giving us hints that we shouldn't be fooled by his formal appearance, he is controlling his sociopathic behaviour inside of him. He does not want to unveil his second personality to the audience until the very end. He is a frightening character because he looks completely normal but there is this impending doom and terror that follows him around wherever he goes. You have the feeling he's a disturbed individual but you don't get enough proof to fully be sure of it.The setting is very chilling and can often be hair-raising. There are multiple frames of the dreary, gloomy, dull and greyish mansion that Norman Bates considers his world. The cinematography is hauntingly beautiful. The camera setups manipulate the audience and ultimately hides them from the truth. Another element of the film that we barely ever see in modern films is when the main character dies in the first act. She was the central figure of the story but her sudden death moves her out of the spotlight and she inevitably becomes a false protagonist.I highly recommend Psycho, it could almost be perceived as a character study. Every dialogue and frame is iconic, it stands the test of time and has the privilege of calling itself the greatest horror movie ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Psycho (1960),"This is a classic horror film, directed by Alfred Hitchcock.

The house on the hill can be recognized by all, and when questioned, you'll hear a response- the house from ""Psycho"" You basically have a woman who's on the run for stealing money from her boss (Marion Crane). A motel owner, who has psychological issues (Norman Bates)and a woman who is in search of her missing sibling (Lila Crane).In a nutshell you have a man who commits murders, while dressed up as a woman.

I like how the film makes such a big deal about Marion and the 40,000 dollars only to completely shift the focus halfway through. The second half gets kind of spoiled by Vera Miles' stiff performance but also offers an interesting twist. Nothing exceptional in 2020, but at that time it must have been something groundbreaking, as Hitchcock had to hire Simon Oakland just to explain the film at the end.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Definitely one of the best.,"Is it the best Hitchcock movie? It's definitely one of his best, right up there with ""The 39 Steps"" and ""Strangers On A Train"" and ""Sabotage"" and ""Shadow Of A Doubt."" He only once again came close to making as good a film, with ""The Birds,"" while Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins never escaped the greatness they helped create here. Poor John Gavin had to quit the biz entirely, and became an ambassador.The movie was adapted from a novel so some of the original audience would have been familiar with the plot of the book. In the novel, Norman Bates was a middle-aged man. I think it was a brilliant stroke to have the Norman of the film as a man in his twenties, a boy who never grew up in a man's body. Anthony Perkins is so identified today with his role of Norman Bates that it was surprising to see how endearingly he played him in the early scenes. And he did one of the best stammers I've ever seen in a movie when he was being questioned by the private detective (Martin Balsam) who is also searching for Marion. I also wasn't expecting to see how protective the local sheriff and his wife were of Norman when they were being questioned about him and his mother. You could tell they didn't want somebody (Norman) whom they thought had been dealt a bad hand to have anymore publicity and scrutiny than he already had.I keep using the word brilliant, but I cannot hide my enthusiasm for this movie. It is wholly unlike the overblown, overbudget, overlong fluff spewing all-too-often out of Hollywood today. ""Psycho"" is simple, well-crafted and just the right length.It's easy to take PSYCHO for granted now; it has been imitated so many times in so many ways by far lesser talents. Indeed, it's one negative is that it inspired so may pale imitations, including its own three sequels and a very bad remake. Yet even so, PSYCHO remains a one and only original. And its iconic status can't be denied; it redefined the concepts of what a Hitchcock film was and what a horror film could be.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The thriller aspect is kept very nicely using the conversation dialog with the camera shooting elsewhere or at outside of the conversation's room. The conflict's final climax is indeed a great twist. It may even be one of the best twists of its time. I like how the movie retains focus after the the character that has been the sole focus of the movie is depicted dead.

Psycho is the perfect thriller,"Aaahhh. Psycho is about as close as you can come to a perfect thriller. Thrillers are all about how the story is told. You show too much, there's not enough suspense. Show to little, and people don't know what's going on. Different angles and lighting can evoke different feelings. Hitchcock is a master of not only coming up with a great story, but telling that story perfectly. Hitchcock finds the perfect balance between terror, suspense, and mystery in all his films, and Psycho is certainly no exception. It is no surprise that one of the most iconic scenes in Hollywood history is in this movie. To top it off the acting is phenomenal as well. Often times with films at the time scenes of strong emotion would be excessively dramatic and over the top. However, in psycho, these scenes are not as often, and when they, the over the top dramatization seems appropriate, considering their lives are usually at stake.

The rest of the cast is first rate like the wonderful Vera Miles as Lila Crane, Marion's concerned sister, and Martin Balsam as the private investigator. I believe the actor who Sam, Marion's cash-strapped lover, is also quite good in the role. Frank Albertson and Lurene Tuttle and Pat Hitchcock also round out a supporting cast. I won't spoil the plot but the classic should not be tampered with as it is simply one of the best thrillers ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Best Horror Movie Ever Made.,"This is, hands down, the best horror movie ever made. It it still praised to this day after 40 years. This movie has it all: good acting, good plot, great cinematography (the shower and staircase murders are outstandingly shot), a lot of suspense, the most memorable score in movie history, and a superb surprise ending (but since this movie is so popular, if you haven't seen it, you probably know the ending anyway).Anthony Perkins is one the best villains ever, at least in the top 5. The house on the hill was hauntingly eerie, because you never knew what could be inside. This is the best horror movie to date, and it will probably never be beaten. Alfred Hitchcock is the best horror/suspense director ever, and one of the best directors ever.If you haven't seen it, watch it! There's no real violence, at least not graphic violence (which is another high point, this  film can still be incredibly convincing without resorting to unnecessary close-ups). Even if you know the end and haven't seen it, watch it anyway, it's worth it! 10/10",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Tony Perkins at his creepy best,"Watch Psycho and you'll find yourself glued to Anthony Perkins very strange Norman Bates.  He's a quiet lad, takes care of the hotel and his sick mother.  A bit odd, but nice enough.  Of course, we don't know what Norman's been up to in that old house.  Perkins allows Norman Bates to get under your skin, and he stays there.  He tricks you with politeness and sincerity, then his creepieness seeps in.  Shot on a very small budget, with the crew from the Alfred Hitchcock Presents tv show, Psycho is the ultimate low budget horror flick.  But what Hitchcock was able to do, it take horror out of the shadows, and shine light on it.  The real shock in Psycho comes at the end, where Norman is sitting there in the holding room.  Watch closely, and you'll see just how powerful ""Mother"" really is.  Truly creepy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It's a shame the twists are now so well-known,"A thirty-something secretary steals $40,000 from her employer's client, and while on the run encounters a young motel proprietor too long under the domination of his mother.This is probably Hitchcock's most famous movie- memorable for being creepy as hell, shot in black and white long after colour films became the norm, one notoriously violent sequence, and two great plot twists that you probably know by now because they've been referenced so many times. Watching Psycho without knowing anything about it would probably be one of the most amazing cinematic experiences ever, so in a way it's kind of a pity that certain scenes have become so iconic and so well-known. Check this film out anyway, regardless of whether or not you know the twists. The suspense isn't constant, and the films' two very distinct halves don't necessarily gel together well, but this is still must-see cinema, and also one of Hitchcock's best. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

WOW,"This movie is almost 60 years old and its still better than most horror movies out there now! I watched this movie for the first time today with a lot of anticipation. I have always seen it appear in lists of top horror movies, top movies from the 1960s, top thriller movies etc. and i have wanted to watch it for the longest time. The acting is phenomenal (bar a couple of minor characters) and the storyline is excellent. Due to the movie being created in the 1960s, CGI was not used, meaning they had to rely on practical effects. Although not very explicit and violent, the practical effects are done well, and the viewer is allowed to imagine the rest. Psycho has done a great job of leaving me feeling unsettled and intrigued at the same time. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing and the dialogue is so natural and brilliant. It is so cleverly written with a couple of twists and turns at the end, which leaves you feeling so satisfied. My heart was just racing the whole time i was watching! 10 out of 10 because not many films leave me with a smile on my face after watching it :-)",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Movie Review: Psycho,"Psycho is probably the most iconic Alfred Hitchcock as well as the one of the most iconic movies ever made. Psycho is about Marion Crane after she steals 40,000 dollars from her employer and plans to run away with her boyfriend. However, after driving through the back roads on a stormy night, she decides to stop at the Bates Motel where she meets the proprietor of the motel Norman Bates. This movie is a real horror classic that is still studied in film classes around the United States to this day. I personally like this movie and the creepy atmosphere that it gives off, it makes it feel like Marion is stuck at this motel with someone that she can't exactly trust. I would recommend this movie to anyone that like horror/thriller movies or just wants to see a classic Alfred Hitchcock movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The best horror movie of all time,"Nowadays we have been exposed to scarier horror and macabre to find Hitchcock's classic frightening.  However, there are certain elements which make this film the best horror movie of all time.Considering the era (1960) Hitchcock used innovative camera angles to build up the tension and fear in Psycho.  For example at the beginning the camera pans down on the motel giving the impression that the house is watching the motel.  This personification (that the house is alive) is used again when Marion's sister (Lila) approaches the house near the end.  The camera changes from objective to subjective numerous times to give the impression that the house is watching Lila.  More camera actions which are innovative is when Bates and Crane are talking over supper.  The low camera angle gives the impression that Norman Bates is bigger and therefore more menacing. This is an early indication of the horror which is to come. These are just examples of the clever use of camera.The music and lightening is a major strength of the film.  For example when there is the scene with the corpse the mummified mother is a mixture of dark and light.  This represents the good and evil side of Norman.  Moreover, there is light shining at the backs of the eye sockets which makes the corpse appear alive.  Hitchcock innovated with the signature tune (""screeching violins"") and that builds up the suspense.  Such directors as Speilberg have copied this idea (e.g. Jaws)Symbolism is a good part of this film.  For example Bates has an unusual hobby of stuffing birds.  By analyzing Anthony Perkins performance he perches on the edge of his chair as if he is a bird seeking his prey (i.e. Crane).  He also acts like a bird when he twitches his head from time to time.  Another clever use of symbolism is when Lila picks up the book in the Psycho house.  She is unsure which side is what as they are equally patterned.  This represents Norman's character; you can't determine his side as he has two personalities. More symbolism is Marion's change in underwear when she packs her case; white represents purity and black represents evil/wrong doing.  Symbolism like this is also used when the camera shows the stuffed bird towering over Bates when he becomes uneasy with Marion's conversation.  This represents his mother watching over him and changing his personality.  By watching the film other examples of symbolism can be depicted throughout.What made Psycho so remarkable at the time was realism.  The setting was a realistic place and familiar to American and worldwide audiences (i.e the motel, the city - Phoenix, Arizona) rather than fictional places like Transylvania.  Also, Norman had a medical condition (he was a psychopath). This was a breakaway from the previous unrealistic films, such as Dracula. This made the film even more frightening and people were scared that such events could occur with ""real"" people.  Also what was realistic about this film was that the characters were neither ""goodies"" or ""baddies"" - they had transformations.  Marion was a mixture of good and bad (the color of her underwear she chooses represents this and the color of the car she buys.) This makes the film more realistic as it shows that people all have good and bad in them, which is true.Moreover what stood out in the film was what happened to Janet Leigh.  She was killed of very early into the film and this shocked audiences that the A-list Hollywood actress was so brutally murdered.  This is nearly on a par with what Drew Barrymore chose to do for Scream when she chose to be Casey. This fact shows Hitchcock has influenced the thinking for other horror movies.Therefore, although you will be better of with Scream or Scary Movie to scare you this film is an example of cinematography at its best.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Classic horror movie,"I feel as though horror movies today are more slasher films then actual horror movies like the works of Alfred Hitchcock's psycho. Watched it, enjoyed it and I feel spoiled by today's horror genre... this feels kinda flat. But looking at it for what it is... suspenseful and creepy!

The way Norman speaks and his odd collection of stuffed birds make me feel weird and thrilling, after that strange murders happen repeatedly, but I couldn't imagine who causes. Especially, the background music is effective for this film. Thanks to BGM and camera works, this film successfully builds scary and tension.

A modern suspense classic and one of the most influential movies of all time.,"'Psycho' is one of the most famous and talked about suspense movies ever made. In fact it has been copied, ripped off and parodied so many times it's often easy to underrate it, but every time I watch it it really works for me. No matter how many times you view it you will notice something new, some shot or bit of business that impresses. Of course there's hardly a movie fan on the planet who doesn't know the major twists in the plot (like the original 'Planet Of The Apes' even people who have never seen it know what's going to happen), but that doesn't really matter, there's more than enough going on here to enjoy. Hitchcock's direction is masterful, and the movie has been hugely influential. Not just obvious films like William Castle's 'Homicidal' or Brian De Palma's 'Sisters' (and let's not even mention Gus Van Sant's misguided remake of some years back!), but Italian giallo and the whole slasher sub-genre wouldn't be the same without 'Psycho'. Even film makers outside the horror/suspense field have been influenced by it, Quentin Tarantino for example. One very famous shot in 'Psycho' is deliberately quoted in 'Pulp Fiction'. The cast of 'Psycho' are all very good, particularly Janet Leigh ('Touch Of Evil') and Vera Miles ('The Searchers') as the Crane sisters, and Martin Balsam ('Cape Fear') as Detective Arbogast. The real stand out performance is by the late Anthony Perkins ('The Trial') as Norman Bates. He is absolutely superb and surely deserved an Oscar. 'Psycho' is one of THE great American movies and should be watched and enjoyed by any movie fan. Hitchcock made many outstanding films, but 'Psycho' must rank with the best of them. A classic movie that has stood the test of time, I don't doubt that it will influence generations of film makers to come.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

So much has been made of the shower scene and the final scene with the mother, and while those are climactic highlights, all of the in-between is very well done as well and often overlooked.

While seen as very tamed from a modern perspective it was very bold of its day. How it delved into the themes of brutal violence and sexuality adds to the scenery of suspense. The use of soundtrack and the shots of he stairs to the overlook of the Motel. The movie has a very eerie somber tone to it. Adding a sense of mystery and suspense.

I can handle a sick old woman!,"50 years ago, Alfred Hitchcock released Psycho. Girl is having an affair with this guy, she runs away with $40,000 that she was supposed to bank for her employer. On the road heading for California to be with her lover, scared, guilt ridden and exhausted, she pulls into the secluded Bates Motel for a night of rest. There she meets the affable Norman Bates, girl takes shower and cinema got a jolt to the system.What can you say about Psycho that hasn't been said before? Well nothing in truth, it's been dissected and discussed by all and sundry since its release in 1960. From critics to film makers and from the man in the street to the King Of Siam (probably), Psycho is known and largely admired by most in this day and age. However, the initial reaction to it on release was mixed, the words ""gimmick movie"" were even used in some quarters, while in others it was labelled as a stain on the great director's career. Made for roughly around $800,000 in just 30 days, and using his basic crew from his TV show, Hitchcock adapts the Robert Bloch pulp novel with cold hearted glee. Manipulating the audience as he lays out his American Nightmare, Hitch deals in fluid camera movements, jolting shock tactics, the ""mother"" of all twists and garners two incredible performances from Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins in the process. Not only that but he's also got Saul Bass helping on the visuals and Bernard Herrmann providing a terrifying stab string score that has long since gone down in the annals of greatness.The proof is in the pudding, that the film is still today, 50 years on, regarded as belonging to the upper echelons of classic cinema, is its lasting legacy. An original and genre bending piece of genius film making from a master of his craft.

A masterclass in suspense,"""Psycho,"" directed by Alfred Hitchcock, is a seminal work in the thriller genre that continues to captivate audiences decades after its release. The film follows Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), a secretary who embezzles money and ends up at the eerie Bates Motel, run by the enigmatic Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). What unfolds is a chilling tale that redefined horror and suspense in cinema.Hitchcock's direction is meticulous, employing innovative techniques to build tension and unease. The infamous shower scene is a testament to his skill, creating a sense of terror without explicit gore. Bernard Herrmann's haunting score is iconic, its screeching violins adding to the film's menacing atmosphere.Anthony Perkins delivers a haunting performance as Norman Bates, portraying a complex character with a disarming charm and underlying darkness. Janet Leigh's portrayal of Marion is compelling, making her sudden exit all the more shocking and effective.""Psycho"" is more than just a horror film; it's a psychological exploration of human nature and madness.

You Can't Just Watch It Once !,"Psycho is the kind of movie that entices you to watch it over and over.  It demands you study the camera angles, facial expressions, background of the scenes, clothes, paintings on the walls, etc.  Simply put:  the movie is a masterpiece.  I get so wrapped up into the movie that I forget that it's forty years later and the actors/actresses in this flick are now all old, or dead.  Anthony Perkins, the man who plays the mysterious Norman Bates who struggles with the love of his mother, died in the 1990s.  Anthony Perkins shows the talent of an actor that is second to none.  His performance is brilliant.Vera Miles reminds me of the nosey best-friend that each one of us has. She's not a totally lovable person but her character shows that deep down, she is a caring person.  She has more guts than me when she goes to the house to visit Norman's mother.John Gavin's role would be the role that most of the men watching the movie could relate to the most.  He appears as a clean-cut man who just so happens is having an affair.  He plays the character of Sam. John Gavin, the actor, is complicated, however.  You will understand when you watch the movie.  He really doesn't speak a lot but his body language is excellent.  I would love to know more about Mr. John Gavin but there's very little information about him on the internet.Patricia Hitchcock is the director's daughter.  She plays the role of an office worker.  Her acting is totally believable and I found myself watching the scene in which she appears over and over.Alfred Hitchcock's famous movie Psycho is my favorite-all-time movie and every time I watch it, I see something else in a scene that I did not see before.Lastly, Janet Leigh plays the woman who checks into Bates' Motel  and it's a visit which the viewer will never forget.I love this movie so much that I wish it were possible for me to shake the hand of every actor and actress who starred in this classic tale.

Atmospheric, orchestral, suspense, the music alone provides all of these essential key areas as well as the visual side. Then there's the mysterious, nagging, possessive mother of Bates who you don't see who dominates him. Strange how bird references come up in this, Hitchcock's fascination. Loved his cameo near the start. The shower scene comprises of utter genius in how it is shot. A stabbing, thrusting, shadowy figure relentlessly going crazy with a deadly blade. Marion's outstretched hand leaving a shocking farewell to her life cruelly ripped away. A close up of her eye, the final montage. Again it's extremely clever how the whole shower scene leaves a bitter taste yet never shows us anything in the regions of graphic violence.

The Best All-Time Horror Film,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" is really the best horror movie ever made.  Its excellence results from the dominant element of suspense in place of gory monotony.  Since next year is the 40th Anniversary of the black-and-white version, I do hope that the prints will be spruced up for a theatrical rerun. I would certainly see it on the silver screen, perhaps along with countless other ""PSYCHO"" fans across the WORLD.  Since this version presents a more complete account of this classic storyline, it is actually better than ""PSYCHO-1998"".  The 1960 ""Psycho"" continues to reign supreme.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Genius,"This psychotic thiller is a work of genius by the director Alfred Hitchcock. Made in 1960 this film was well ahead of its time.  The movie stars Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates, a curious motel manager, Janet Leigh as Marion Crane, John Gavin as Sam Loomis, and John McIntire as Sheriff Al Chambers.Psycho forever changed the way films were made in Hollywood.  Alfred Hitchcock's genius shaped this masterpiece in such a way to draw the viewer in and keeping them on the edge of their own seat.  With his experience in movie making, Hitchcock knows just how to influence and play with the mind.Alfred Hitchcock is considered `The Master of Suspense,' and has earned that name rightfully.  He created movies that one would have to watch over and over again in order to get all the little details of a film. Psycho is a perfect example of that, using lighting and camera angles to give the watcher a feeling of being anxious, scared, or weary of what is about to happen.  One might notice that when any certain scene is shown, the camera gets closer and closer to the actor or actress's face, making it very uncomfortable to watch.  Every aspect of this film is amazing for it's time, with a score that has been nominated to be one of the top 100 most influential pieces of music in American history.Overall, I give Psycho a 9 out of 10 stars, for being a good movie in general.  It's a powerful film that goes deeper than just scaring people. I would recommend this movie to anybody who loves old horror classics.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Overall, a classic in the horror genre that lives up to the name as many iconic elements of the movie make Psycho a must-watch for the slasher genre (especially considering how ahead of its time it was), even though it does have a good amount of filler elements and the exposition and resolution could have been worked on a bit.Great Direction (was able to manage the use of different angles and scenes to help tell and move the story forward; gets a lot out of his actors), Good to Very Good Acting (Great from Anthony Perkins (Does a great job in showing the anxiety and demented nature of the character), Good from Vera Miles (Very 60s style acting), Good from John Gavin (Very over-the-top 60s style of acting), Good from Martin Balsam, Good from John McIntire, Very Good from Janet Leigh (Really holds her own and plays the female lead well, uses facial expressions and emotions to share the state of the character), Good from the rest of the cast (Very 60s)), Great Story (Laid out well (though focuses a bit too much on exposition), has a lot of twists and turns to help make it a horror/mystery class, and has great character writing when it comes to the two leads (especially Norman)), Very Good Screenplay (The dialogue is very fitting for the time, the humor was decent and kept it a bit light-hearted; the horror elements were very iconic and helped lay the groundwork for future slasher movies; uses allusions and symbols to help keep the audience guessing the mystery; foreshadowing was really good (especially to help lay the groundwork for the twist at the end)), Great Score (Iconic and helps with building suspense), Very Good Cinematography (especially the use of multiple camera angles and techniques to give illusions of fear and movement; a bit dated though compared to modern technology), Good Sound (Very evident with the use of Foley effects, but helps will building suspense; good for the time), Very Good Editing (Helps with transitioning between scenes and camera angles), Good Production Design (Mostly for the iconic Bates Motel), Plot Structure was good as all points were laid out; the movie spends a bit too much time on the exposition and the resolution (while iconic) was a bit convoluted for no reason, Pacing was good for the most part (although there were a lot of filler shots that could be cut into a quarter of the time just to fill space (like Norman cleaning or Marion's sister walking up the stairs)), Climax was the most suspenseful and some of the best parts of the movie (and the build to the climax was also executed well), Tone was more of a mystery/thriller than it was a horror movie; helped lay the groundwork for future slasher movies (but still feels limited given when it was released), The character of Norman Bates is incredibly written as it shows the effects isolation and jealousy can have on an individual to descend into madness (with Perkins capturing this essence very well through his mannerisms and acting); the elements of horror as not necessarily the focal point of the movie as the film after the first hour is more a constant suspense rather than murdersORIGINAL (11/08/2021)

it's good apart from the middle.,What people don't tell you about this movie is how much it sags in the middle.I don't want to spoil anything but I think you can guess what happens early on that might do that.I was very intrigued as this movie started. I was curious to see what became of these characters. Then we meet Norman Bates and he is exactly what we want to see in these kinds of movies. He conveys an unintentionally disquieting character. You really feel like you are dealing with a damaged character but one who doesn't wear it on their sleeve like other characters would.There's the iconic scene which is stunning of course but then it drags because there's nothing to do except follow police procedure. That is the laziest kind of story: just follow people whose job it is to investigate macabre things...But it does pull itself together by the end. The ending will really stay with you. It's just thoughtful.,5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Best Psycho film ever,This movie is the best Horror film I have seen. To this day this film is still talked about Anthony Perkins best film. Janet Leigh did good also. It had a really creepy ending. But it had mysterious and chilling parts about Norman Bates.They just did a remake in 1998. But it will never match this one.This movie also made the way for such films as Halloween and Friday the 13th.

Hitchcock's masterpiece,"This is one of a very rare kind of movies that deserves all the hype surrounding it.Due to the brilliant direction from Hitchcock this didn't even felt like a 60's movie, this could be brand new!Anthony Perkins was just phenomenal, I normally dont think about how good an actor is while watching, but in this case I thought about that several times, so cant help but to bow to this performance!The script is very well written and solid. The thriller is everywhere, from the beggining with scenes that dont really have much impact to the main plot, to the end where my heart was racing, and I was anxious trying to figure out how would this going to end.There's really nothing more that you can ask for.

Much better than I expected. Amazing movie.,"When i rented this movie, I knew it was a classic but i didn't expect much of it. I didn't think it would be an amazing movie or scary at all. I have seen the birds, and some other Hitchcock movies which didn't scare me in any way, so i didn't think this one would either. Well this movie ended up creeping me out. I cant imagine how people reacted to it when it first came out in theaters in 1960. I love horror movies and not many scare me anymore but this one did.I think it would have been even better for me if I hadn't heard it was based off of ed gein, because that sort of gave away the end for me. Do NOT let anyone tell you about this movie before you see it. It will ruin it for you! And Don't look it up. Don't want to give anything away... amazing movie",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Are there still any vacancies at the Bates Motel?,"(Some Spoilers) Alfred Hitchcock's classic horror thriller about murder and madness at the deadly and infamous Bates Motel managed by the weird but seemingly harmless son of the motel owner Mrs. Bates Norman, Anthony Perkins.The film ""Psycho"" starts out inside a darkened hotel room on a broiling Friday afternoon in December in the city of Phoenix Arizona. Marion Crane and Sam Loomis, Janet Leigh and John Gavin, have just finished off an afternoon quickie as they both get dressed to get back to their individual jobs after their lunch break. Depressed at having to meet and make love in the secrecy of a hotel room instead of at home like a married couple is getting both Marion and Sam very upset but they don't have the money to get married as well as raise a family. With Marion having a job as a secretary and Sam as a warehouse manager and also being very deeply in debt.Marion later that afternoon is called into the office of her boss George Lowery, Vaughn Taylor, and given some $40,000.00 in cash from a client of his Tom Cassidy, Frank Albertson,to put away at the local bank for the weekend. It's then that something clicks in Marion's mind where she decides to steal the money and use it to skip town and later marry Sam.Trading in her old car for a new one at a car dealership with $700.00 of the stolen cash Marion drives out west to California and as night falls it starts to rain very heavily and with the visibility next to zero she goes off the main highway on to a small country road that leads to the Bates Motel. Getting a room from Norman Bates at the motel Norman starts to become friendly and falls for the pretty sweet as well as obviously distressed Marion. This makes Norman's old and infirm mother Mrs.Bates very angry with him for not paying any attention towards her. Mrs. Bates also develops a very vicious and violent hatred towards Marion for what she thinks is her stealing Norman away from her.Later in her motel room Marion has seconds thoughts about her taking the $40,000.00 and plans to return it the next day to her employer back in Phoenix after having a good nights sleep at the motel but the bitter and vengeful Mrs. Bates has other ideas. Horrific film that has you at the edge of your seat and by the end falling off it. With the murderous Mrs. Bates on a knife wielding rampage attacking and slashing Marion as she's taking a shower leaving her to bleed to death on the floor of the bathtub.The shower scene is one of the most terrifying horror sequences ever put on film. The scene slowly builds itself up as the crazed Mrs. Bates enters Marion's room and creeps up to her in the shower. Quickly pulling the shower curtains apart Mrs. Bates lays into Marion with a large kitchen knife that had people in movie houses back them, 1960, choke on their popcorn and candy bars. Alfred Hitchcock set the scene up in a deliberately slow and deadly pace but when it exploded it left those watching, like poor Marion, in a state of first shock and then sheer terror.Even more effective, but not as popular with the movie going public, is when Mrs. Bates confronts private detective Milton Arbogast (Martin Balsam), who was hired to find Marion,at the top of the stairs in the Bates house. All at once when you, and Det. Arbogast, never expected it Mrs. Bates lashes her knife into Det. Arbogast face cutting it open. As Det. Arbogast falls to the bottom of the staircase Mrs. Bates pounces on him, like a cat, and savagely finishes him off. This all happened so fast that you, like Arbogast, didn't even have enough time to anticipate it which made it that much more effective.It later turns out that the insane Mrs. Bates had already murdered a number of people, before she murdered both Marion and Det. Arbogast, over the years and had them and their cars sunk in a nearby lake with the help of her willing son Norman to hide the evidence.The shock to end all shocks comes near the end of the movie when Marion's sister Lila, Vera Miles, goes down to the basement of the Bates house and finds out just who and what Mrs. Bates really is and who was the real person behind the bloody and brutal murders at the Bates Motel.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Cinema's masterpiece,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" is widely regarded as a masterpiece of suspense and psychological horror. Released in 1960, the film remains a landmark in cinematic history and has had a significant influence on the thriller genre.""Psycho"" tells the story of Marion Crane (played by Janet Leigh), a secretary who steals money from her employer and goes on the run. She ends up at the secluded Bates Motel, owned by the enigmatic Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). As the film unfolds, it delves into the twisted psychology of Norman and reveals a series of shocking and suspenseful events.One of the most notable aspects of ""Psycho"" is Hitchcock's masterful direction. He skillfully builds tension throughout the film, using various techniques to keep the audience on the edge of their seats. From the iconic shower scene to the suspenseful moments leading up to it, Hitchcock's precise camera work and editing create an atmosphere of unease and dread.Anthony Perkins delivers a standout performance as Norman Bates, portraying a complex and disturbed character with subtlety and depth. His portrayal of the character has become iconic, and his transformation throughout the film is both captivating and chilling.Another notable aspect of ""Psycho"" is its groundbreaking narrative structure. Hitchcock takes unexpected turns and subverts audience expectations, leaving them questioning the nature of the story and its characters. This approach was highly innovative for its time and has had a lasting impact on the thriller genre.The film's score, composed by Bernard Herrmann, deserves special mention as well. The haunting and memorable music enhances the suspense and contributes to the overall atmosphere of the film.""Psycho"" is not only a gripping thriller but also a thought-provoking exploration of human psychology and the duality of human nature. It raises questions about identity, repression, and the capacity for violence within seemingly ordinary individuals.Overall, ""Psycho"" is a cinematic masterpiece that continues to captivate audiences to this day. Hitchcock's expert direction, Perkins' mesmerizing performance, the innovative narrative structure, and the atmospheric score all contribute to making it a timeless classic in the realm of psychological horror.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Shocking,"Psycho is one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films ever made and is one of the few horror masterpieces in film history. That's the main-line, given stroke of it. But what it comes down to is that, really, seriously... it's Psycho - the one and only (that we acknowledge, screw off, Gus Van Sant). More than anything why it's Hitchcock's triumph as a commercial filmmaker - past the shower scene and the camera tricks and the notorious finale - is that it's (not so) secretly a monument to what we hide in all of us.What I love about the movie seeing it again after so many years is seeing how in her own way Marion Crane is a bit of a psycho, just not quite at the level of 11 that Norman Bates is. There's an interesting parallel to make to how voice-over is used; Marion's imagination gets the better of her for a moment as she drives along and she makes up what the cop that pulls her over, her boss, her boyfriend, etc, all say. Watch as her face contorts into a little grin, almost against her better judgment, when she imagines the more twisted portion of the dialog. Frankly, I've had dialogs going in my head like that, imagining the worst that could happen from a mistake or bad deed, and almost taking pleasure in the more morbid aspects (I mean, hey, I directed Jealous Jerzy, what does that tell you? But I digress).So keep that in mind when it comes time for the end of the movie - hell any portion really with Norman and ""Mother"". But mostly that last scene. After what is an amusing parody of exposition (the psychologist goes on for so long that it's the only logical explanation aside from dated, clunky writing - I prefer to think Hitchcock was smarter than that and was mocking what would or could be an exposition on Norman Bates + Mother and then just ""Mother""), Norman/Mother is in his/her room, and the camera closes in as the voice-over gets intense, plotting, paranoid, not wanting to swat a fly. Perhaps Hitchcock wants to draw the parallel, though there is a distinction: Marion imagines other people talking, while Norman isn't even in the equation: it IS Mother. Yeah.Such great stuff. And if you haven't seen it before... what are you reading this for ya dummy!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

PSYCHO's breaking waves still shock the film world,"Although it is virtually impossible to replicate the effect of the original release in 1960, ""Psycho"" remains a disturbing and macabre psychological thriller where we watch a meticulous work with the camera that thickens the suspense coupled with the soundtrack by Bernard Herrmann and Anthony Perkins's performance of Norman Bates, in addition to a most well-structured argument. This is quintessential Hitchcock, inspired by the true case of the murderer Ed Gein. Hitch then frankly defied the limits of the already agonizing, though still active Production Code. ""Psycho"" addressed such themes as adultery, homicide, Oedipus Complex, transvestism, mental disorder, exhumed bodies, everything exposed both subtly and graphically. ""Psycho"" introduced us to an antagonist of enormous psychological density; a psychopath with indelible mental disorders whose causes and motives were only fully discovered in the whodunit's climax.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
good movie,By watching the newer version of this movie first it didn't make seeing the original as good as it would of been if I had seen it first. The movie overall was great it had all the elements of a great thriller you didn't know who the real killer was until you got close to the end of the film. The plot was great the way the story unfolded was another strong point in the movie. The actors played their roles really well especially the killer his character was great because he was just nervous a the time but got defensive in an instant whenever his mother is involved which kept it really entertaining given the fact that you don't see the mother you only hear her.

An Absolute Classic,"Finally, 60 years after its initial release, I got around to seeing Psycho after hearing references all the time and, of course, seeing the shower scene pop up in every compilation of greatest horror moments, or in essays and other writings about the genre. Ultimately, it's deserving of its iconic status: this is a truly fantastic film.In terms of personal preference, I don't like this one quite as much as Rosemary's Baby or The Exorcist, which are at the absolute top my list, but this film is worthy of its praise. It was ahead of its time, showing the audience things that had never been shown before (the first flushing toilet in American cinema, for example), it portrayed things that were taboo and often not discussed by the ""polite"" society of the time, and it is perhaps the greatest use of a musical score in history. That grating, screeching music is burned into the collective conscience of society, to the point of some people thinking of that score every single time they step into a shower.Anthony Perkins is a fantastic Norman Bates. There's no question about that. Having just seen the original for the first time, I'm interested to see how he expands and develops the character in subsequent instalments, because there's definitely a lot of potential there.And, of course, we have Janet Leigh, my personal favorite part of the entire film. Mother to Jamie Lee Curtis, Leigh earned the ""iconic horror badass"" crown just 18 years before her daughter would go on to do the very same thing in ""Halloween."" Janet's character isn't the traditional stupid character that ends up in the wrong place at the wrong time; she makes some bad decisions, but she's intelligent about the way she handles things, which is really nice for a change. Of course, without spoilers (if you don't know by now, you must be new to the genre), Janet is the face of that iconic shower scene, and it truly is one of the best scenes in classic horror history. It's not particularly graphic (dealing with censors back in the day had to have been an absolute NIGHTMARE), but it effectively finds that ""sweet spot"" between showing the audience what they want and pleasing the powers that be.A lot of time has passed since Psycho first came out, but the passing of time hasn't tamed this beast. It's inevitable to view the film a little differently in the light of present day, but it still has the power to raise the hairs on the back of your neck 60 years later. While the shock might not have the same effect, the emotion that it's able to create in the viewer makes this one a guaranteed success.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
psycho,This movie really influenced horror movies today so its a great film and easy to appreciate. The use of loud and sharp music adds to the fear. The shower scene is a great example of a lot of things the music that starts to play to imply something sinister is about to happen. The Hand holding the knife and the terrified expressions. All of that is intense. The most brutal part to me though is actually after the killing because the girl is just dead on the shower floor and all wee see is her face and the entire time the shower Is still running that right there is chilling. The shower still going is so genuine the fact that the clip doesn't end right after the act just makes the murder feel real like shes dead and there is nothing left but the water. This film is filled with groundbreaking shots. That being said I find Hitchcock to be a little corny in instances. Like sometimes someone will walk back too far and fall off something to their death and that just seems dumb to me but all in all this was a good movie.,7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Not the ""masterpiece"" that people were talking about","Something most people don't know: This movie is a book adaptation. So we can't take the plot of this movie as a scoring point. We need to consider the remaining issues. Cinematography and acting.The movie was shot in the 60's. Although it was really nice for its time, I am sure that people who are used to modern cinema while watching it today (unless they have a nostalgia fetish) will get bored. Although I find the cutscenes very successful for some reason, there is an incredible soullessness in the main scenes and the speaking scenes. This situation can be an obstacle for us to bond with the characters in the movie. But let's say that this movie was probably presented to you as a ""masterpiece"", so I'm trying to lower your expectations. Otherwise, both the intermediate and main scenes are absolutely fine.The acting is the point that ruined the movie. Although I don't believe that people's understanding of reality was different in the 1960s, this acting made me laugh more than nervously in the famous scene of that movie. The acting in the movie (although it was considered standard at the time) is a disgrace.

Substance is Quality,"And less is more. Films like this are true gems. It's a cliché but it's true: They don't make them like this anymore. Today's horror movies lack even a hint of subtlety.

Today's horror movies are devoid of subtle suspense, frankly they make me laugh, and that's not horror. They jump the shark invariably. Nothing is left to the imagination. This film is different.The first time I watched this movie was at the Pittsburgh Playhouse in 1980. I was 11 years old and ready for some horror. The playhouse itself was an older affair (dated to the 1800's) and rumored itself to be haunted. The viewing was old style reel to reel. The die was cast. What a magnificent setting for a young boy to see this particular classic horror film. I swear I can still recall the seating and the popcorn in that old theatre, and being intrigued by this film.Enough about that, back to the film.Anthony Perkins (Norman) acting in this movie are astonishingly top shelf. The script and Perkins' delivery portray a creepy shut-in schizophrenic to a tee. His acting is superb and compelling. The character of Norman Bates was realistically creepy, a real strange fellow.The role of Detective Arbogast is very well portrayed.I'm deliberately going to leave a lot out of my review here because I don't want to spoil it for others.If you appreciate the old black and whites, this movie is highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Every frame of this movie is intentional, and as a film student, I highly recommend it to any person who is interested in directing or simply in viewing movies as art instead of entertainment.  Hidden within every moment, every camera angle is a metaphor or foreshadowing of what is to come.The unusual plot structure (I will not go into details, I do not want to spoil anything) is just another reason why this movie merits at least one viewing.  The acting by Anthony Perkins is stunning, bone-chilling, unforgettable.  This movie scared me half to death, and the surprise ending shocked me; there is nothing predictable about 'Psycho'.And whatever you do - do NOT compare it to the sequels or remakes.

She returns late to her office and her boss asks her to deposit US$ 40,000,00 in cash in the bank relative to real state he has just sold. Marion steals the money and heads to California to meet Sam.

Alfred Hitchcock has also decided to make a low-budget movie in black-and-white to fulfill his contract with Universal Studios. The plot is based on a dark novel by Robert Bloch that Hitchcock read, with modifications by Joseph Stefano due to censorship and to make Norman Bates attractive to the audience since his character in the book was very repulsive. The plot is ahead of time and unusual, since the lead lady Janet Leigh dies in the beginning of the story. The cast is superb, with Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh, Vera Miles, John Gavin and Martin Balsam, and to keep the mystery, Hitchcock bought all the copies of the novel and released the need to cast someone for the role of Norman Bates' mother.

Endlessly fascinating classic,"Psycho is yet another Hitchcock masterpiece. This one is one his few true horror films, but it continues his trademark use of suspense and dread. Janet Leigh (unforgettable here) is the heroine (or maybe not). Anthony Perkins is unnervingly creepy as the Ultimate Mama's Boy. Bermard Herrmann's truly classic score was not even nominated for an Oscar, which basically makes Oscars useless. This is one of HItchcock's most adroitly cast movies; he even makes good use of the vapid hunkiness of John Gavin, and Vera Miles is terrific as Leigh's sister. Also wonderful are Lurene Tuttle, John McGavin and Pat Hitchcock (""she's always a bit late on Mondays""). And Virginia Gregg as Mrs. Bates' voice. Mercedes McCambride who? This movie is built for repeat viewings; if you are one of the few who hasn't seen it, do NOT let anyone tell you the plot. Then watch it. It's a great picture.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
My favorite horror movie,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It is spectacular without any visual effects or screams, it is capable of making me tense, and also the soundtrack is exceptional.A very good story, beginning, middle, and end. And the twist at the end is incredible and well-built. Besides, the name ""Psycho"" is perfect and very well-founded. I really liked the actors, especially and obviously Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins).This film has also given us one of the most iconic scenes in cinema in general, the bathroom scene. And apart from small details, such as Marion's underwear changes from white to black after committing the robbery.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Classic Horror Movie.,The movie itself is a classic and told really well throughout. I found the story to be really interesting with a runaway enters a motel run by a shy owner with a secret about him. The movie is build up really well throughout and is never boring. I really like how there's a bunch of symbols throughout and is interesting on what is the symbolism means. Also the dialogue is done really well by the performance and is interesting to hear it. The atmosphere is done really well with its awesome music and tone throughout. There's also a couple of scenes that people from the 60's didn't expect to see and those scenes are still effective on how it executed. And I really like the whole mystery over Norman Bates and his backstory.I found the twist ending to be really great with its revealed and the whole explanation over it.,9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Mean Strings,"How do you write about, let alone review something that's been picked apart and assembled again, stretched into 24 hour performances by lesser artists, copied, imitated, quoted, spoofed, franchised, and even remade shot for shot? About something that has been appreciated, raved about and even worshipped for nearly 60 long years by audiences, devotees and eventually even critics?There are reasons for all that. John Gavin may have been wooden but Vera Miles was good enough, Janet Leigh and Robert Balsam were exceptionally good and Perkins was sensational. It was Robert Bloch's best achievement in lurid pulp, Stefano's best screenwriting moment and Hitch was quite literally at the height of his powers. So were his wife Alma and assistant Peggy, who also sensed how times were changing and how the audiences were ready for something never before attempted or seen - a film with moments so pounding and visceral that it would end up changing the entire ballgame.And then there's the score, equally deeply ingrained on our culture. ""Hitchcock does about two thirds of his films - I finish them for him"" - Herrmann would say, and it's been true from Harry through to Marnie. This one contains the most famous musical cue of all times and a neurotic, hurtling main title to boot, but it is the slow bits, during which Hitch handles the passage of time, trouble, unease, mystery, suspense and degradation that are just superb, allowing for some of the most exciting moments ever commited to film. Elegant and decidedly modern, all the more lethal for its reduction to a chamber string orchestra, the score is well produced too; loads of sticky reverb and compression were slapped on those ferocious shrieks, making them always sound a bit limp on later recordings - and certainly lacking that thoroughly ripping effect. Luckily, Hitch gave in and went along with his composer.To wrap it up - the less said about Psycho, the better - and it is best enjoyed in silence and darkness. It has a flaw or two but its unique, darkly unsettling magic speaks for itself even today and it still feels like an exceptionally modern, cool, groundbreaking film. Whatever Walt Disney may have thought of it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
B/W is Best,"Do we actually need color pictures? How come that this in that perspective so outdated movie still does its job so much better than colored counterparts?In fact, I ask myself why other film makers still insist on color instead of B/W knowing the impact of Psycho and Film Noir. There are some clever adaptations, though viz the bleak colors, such as in Seven, Sixth Sense and The Ring. Psychological horror tends to fade to gray.Well, despite all this, Hitchcock's the Suspense Master and Psycho is his best film. I'd like to compare to Agatha Christie's best story, the 6th most sold novel of all times, Ten Little N*****s aka And Then There Were None: there is something crude about both productions. TLN is not very elaborated in its language, rather straightforward. Yet, the background information about each victim is direct and convincing. The main plot is fantastic and the atmosphere the novel brings at least got me entangled in it.Now, Psycho on the other hand, has a less fantastic story: it could happen that a girl at large ends in a gloomy motel at the will of a mentally ill murderer. The similarity rather lies in the movie's lack of pretension, in stark contrast to say, Vertigo.Besides this comparison, it's noteworthy that Psychostarted of the slasher type flicks, complete with the eerie staccato musical scoreintroduced and indulged in various new elements in film such as a toilet bowl close upis a two act movie: first act is about the female protagonist's stealing of money, the second is about the male protagonist's killing of her and his disturbed lifelacks the typical Mac Guffin ingredient as the motivations for the protagonists are well introduced and of great importance to the plotdeals openly with sex topics as transvestismhas a Christiesque the-detective-presents-the-crime-summing up in the final scene where the psychologist explains to the DA what has happenedhas a number of details from other movies, for instance, Norman Bates was not the innovative character it could have been since Orson Welles already invented the neurotic Motel Host in A Touch of Evil (1958) played by Dennis Weaver. In the same movie Janet Liegh was terrorized in the motel, as well, even making the choice of actress unoriginal. The corpse dumping method by means of putting it in a car trunk was used by Hitchcock in One More Mile to Go (1956).",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The Ultimate Psycho,"Been meaning to watch this reputed 'masterpiece' for years and finally I got hold of it. Is it as good as everyone says? The thing is, nothing can describe the experience. Even though I have watched almost countless psychological thrillers over the years, nothing really compares to 'Psycho'. One would have to experience the film in order to find out the answer to the aforementioned question. Luckily, I haven't watched the remake which is said to be a scene by scene copy.An atmosphere of darkness is set right from the beginning where one witnesses Sam and Marion who have just made love in a hotel room. Nothing particularly happens in that scene but there seems to be a lingering doom that will follow one of the characters soon. The black and white seems to work towards the film's benefit and stress on the chilling atmosphere. The closeup shots are especially effective. For example, notice the policeman wearing the sunglasses looking as though wearing a cold unsympathetic expression that creeps out Marion.All the actors do a great job in that department. John Gavin is quite dashing as Sam Loomis. Janet Leigh is sensual and sophisticated. Vera Miles is terrific as Marion's concerned sister. Martin Balsam too leaves a mark and Anthony Perkins immortalizes Norman Bates.The dialogues are clever and the editing is sharp. The twists are great as they 'make sense' with the story. Although I saw the ending coming, it fits well with everything. Hitchcock's film is very much an atmospheric piece and he has succeeded greatly in drawing the desired response from the viewer (even by forbidding cinema halls to not allow customers who arrived late). The sense of chill looms over, especially after viewing the final scene.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

FABULOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"For being known as the `Master of suspense' Hitchcock is definitely successful to fulfill the title he has been given. Psycho wasn't exactly a horrifying experience, however for its time is was quit a spooky film. The techniques used for lighting, camera angle, and music are absolutely phenomenal and very powerful.For example in one scene of this film, the main character is driving her car and the camera is angled at her face head on. The lighting outside of the car is gloomy and somewhat dark, and the music was extremely intense. The entire mood and atmosphere of this scene made everyone migrate to the edge of their seat, and their knuckles white from gripping their arm rests.Also very powerful, and wise, was the symbolism that Hitchcock used throughout this film. For example in the beginning we see the main character sleeping with a man in her hotel room. She is clothes with a white skirt, and a white bra. A few scenes later, after she has commited a robbery, she is back in her hotel room wearing a black skirt and a black bra. The fact that she has just commited a sin, and is now dressed in black, is a great example of powerful symolism.The camera work was most definetly phenomenal. Part of the movie takes place in or at a hotel complex, and the house that the owner lives out is at the top of a little hill right behind the hotel. The house looks incredibly frightening but the angle that the camera shoots at makes it even more scary, and definetly gives you the chills.I do not wish to get into any more detail regarding this film, because I don't want to spoil it for the viewer. However, I would definitely suggest watching psycho. I have yet to hear of anyone who is not satisfied with this film, and I doubt that I ever will. I rate this movie at a 10 for being 100% extraordinary!!! I suggest it to anyone wanting a good spook, or even just someone who enjoys watching brilliant writing put into motion and displayed through this wonderful and enjoyable movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Hitchcock twists the knife into the audience,"This was one of Hitchcock's experiment films. After the lavish productions of Vertigo and North by Northwest, and while noting the financial success of smaller and cheaper B-movies, he decided that he wanted to make a movie for less than a million dollars. He hired a lot of the crew from his television series Alfred Hitchcock Presents and largely unknown actors like Vera Miles (who had played Henry Fonda's wife in The Wrong Man) and Anthony Perkins. Another thing he did to minimize the cost of the film was negotiate a contract with Paramount to reduce his own fee for a percentage of the ticket sales. Thinking the movie wouldn't make much money, Paramount was happy to oblige and Hitchcock ended up making the 2016 equivalent of about $150 million.The thing about this movie as a story is that it's almost an endless supply of red herrings from start until over-explained ending. Janet Leigh's character, the point of view character for the first forty-five minutes of the film, is a red herring. Norman's mother is a red herring. The idea that Norman buried another woman in his mother's grave is a red herring. The money is a red herring. It's not only the audience latching onto things that ultimately don't matter but characters as well as they circle around the problem but only come to the actual source in the movie's final moments. On paper, it feels like a movie that would annoy me rather than entertain me. It's just this side of lying to the audience, but Hitchcock maintains narrative discipline and integrity while playing with us so expertly that he gets away with it. It really is the best single example of what he said, ""Always make the audience suffer as much as possible.""The thing about slashers is that the genre has completely devolved to the point where the kills are the only important thing and the characters getting killed don't really matter. They're just meat for the grinder. Well, there are only two deaths in Psycho and both are of characters that we actually spend time getting to know. The first is obviously Janet Leigh's Marion Crane. She doesn't even arrive at the Bates Motel for a full half hour. Instead we get her relationship to Sam Loomis, a divorcee who pays alimony and lives in the back of a hardware store, her dreams of running away with him where money isn't an issue, and her job situation where she suddenly gets $40,000 in cash handed to her to place in the company's safety deposit box. Without any dialogue to explain her actions, she simply goes home, packs up her bags (changes from a white bra to a black one) and drives away from Phoenix towards California where her boyfriend lives.She drives, desperate to avoid detection, sleeping on the side of the road in her car, exchanging her car for another in California, and, in a rainstorm, stops at the hotel where she meets the proprietor, Norman Bates. Anthony Perkins as Bates is one of the key special ingredients to this film. From his innocent introduction to the sinister ending, he's complex and endlessly watchable. His first scene, from his greeting of Marion to wishing her goodnight after their small dinner in his parlor, is such a great moment. Despite his innocence, there's something off about him. He's too innocent for his age. He seems boyish instead of just nice, and then the conversation turns to his mother and a darkness comes out of him. This is the much better version of the first scene in Strangers on a Train. There, Bruno was far too aggressive too early for me to sell the ideas at play, but here, Norman Bates is such a disarming naïf for the first few minutes that his dark turn doesn't feel like it should send Marion screaming.Marion decides that her actions were not worthwhile and that she should go back, figuring out how much she owes from the money she used on her trip out, and then she dies. What sets Psycho apart from most modern slashers is that incredible cruelty for Marion because we, the audience, end up on her side, happy that she's going to return back, and then she dies. We spent forty-five minutes getting to know her, watching her make a huge mistake, and then begin to turn around on that mistake before she was taken away. It's emotional investment that's required for us to feel the murder. If she had been on screen for five minutes before her death, there would have been no investment on the part of the audience, but we feel her death and when the investigation of her death picks up in the second major portion of the film, heading by Sam Loomis, Marion's sister Lila, and the private investigator Arbogast, we want the investigation to move forward.And that's really important because of who the actual murderer is. This is where the red herrings play out really well. We're led to believe for most of the movie that Norman's mother is the killer as complex thoughts about Norman's innocence and loyalty to his mother play out. He becomes an accomplice, but his devotion to his mother who's so cruel to him is admirable at the same time. We end up kind of rooting for him, being on his side rather than Sam's when Sam comes to question Norman. It's so effective that as we see Norman in his final shot as his mother's voice speaks in voiceover, we still feel for Norman, lost in the blackhole of his mind to his mother's power over him. So, she ends up truly being the killer, but it's still Norman at the same time.It's Hitchcock playing with the audience, twisting the knife into them about expectations, emotional investment, and denouements. He's playing the audience like a fiddle, and it works so incredibly well. It's experimental, cruel, and wildly effective. For a movie that seems to rely so much on a twist, it holds up remarkably well because Hitchcock knew that it was more than just a twist. It was a story that needed fully fleshed out characters.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Hitch's best. One of the best and most memorable suspense thrillers in film history. Well liked for the famous shower scene.,"""Psycho"" is without a doubt a classic film a suspense thriller that ranks well in memory it impacted cinema and pop culture it's a film that ranks as iconic history. When I first saw it I was even afraid to take showers as a kid! As the famous shower scene impacted me that much, and many people even had a phobia of staying in a motel after seeing this film classic. Later thru the years after countless viewings I adjusted and saw every moment of the film as pleasure as after I learned how the shower scene was shot I learned to appreciate cinema history and the techniques of how the shower scene was shot with superior montage editing.Alfred Hitchcock the master of thriller suspense had it all in ""Psycho"" the many themes present are lust, sex, embezzlement, greed, secrets, taxidermy, voyeurism, and a split personality which caused someone to cross dress as their dead mother! Aside from that the shower shower scene is memorable one of the most famous in film history and combined with the performances of Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh, ""Psycho"" is a memorable classic that a viewer can't get enough of.Set in Arizona it begins with Marion Crane(played so beautiful and very elegantly sexy by Janet Leigh a 60's screen siren. Plus it was a real treat to see Janet undress and sport that sexy black bra!)a woman who as a lonely secretary only has a hobby of being a sexy and elegant seducer of her boyfriend a man who's divorced. And Marion wants escape so one Friday afternoon after returning from lunch break when she receives a payment for her boss from a rich oil business man an ideal is sprung to mind. Marion will leave town only the money is not put in the bank it will take a journey ride with Marion to California. Interesting and very watchful along the way is the scenes of the deep voiced policeman who follows Marion a little distance, as I think Hitchcock used these scenes to show a viewer that Ms. Crane felt guilt about her exit.Only one rainy evening in California she drives upon the lonely Bates motel and this place feels different as it's clearly not what it seems. Attending is Norman Bates(wonderfully done and over the top by Anthony Perkins) who's a strange guy a shut in who tends to his old sick mother(supposedly)and Norman has a hobby of collecting dead birds! As he talks and checks Ms. Crane in Norman seems normal, yet he's anything but. Then shocking is when Marion gets settled in she tries to unwind and chill with a hot shower, only this is one shower that will spray out a sliced up death as it will become a blood bath! As Marion will clearly have her secrets washed away in blood.Many don't know the shower scene was shot from seventy different camera positions. As the montage editing is fantastic as the way the shots were linked together showing a certain form of art. This was adapted from the Soviet Union from the classic director Eisenstein as the clashing of images is graphic as it matches the film's shower scene so well. As each clashing scene the knife is shown going back and fourth from Leigh's body the images clash with blood showing the graphic side of life as this film has a bloody form of art. And most telling and chilling is the final shot when Janet falls as the blood drips down the tub drain showing her dead the drain symbolizes her life has indeed went down the drain! Really this is one scene I can go on and on about as if you know and study film their is always something you can find that the shower scene symbolizes and links to life and a graphic form of death. The scene was just so brilliant.So did Norman do it or was it mad mother who knows as Hitchcock tries to keep it a little suspenseful. Only you the viewer know the real shock poor Norman is a dressed up guy having a thing for women's wardrobe! Overall great suspense thriller classic from Alfred it proves we all have the right to go a little mad. It proves that you can't run from and hide your secrets. And when you arrive in a strange place you never know what to expect, as hidden secrets are present and they might just be stranger than yours just even mad and crazy!

Thrilling & Masterful,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" is so well known for inducing suspense and terror that it is easy to overlook what a great achievement it is in many other respects.  It works so well as a thriller because everything fits together perfectly - the directing, acting, and music all help to turn a good story into a great movie.The plot begins when ...  But anyone reading these comments has either (a) seen ""Psycho"" already, perhaps several times, and thus knows everything that happens, or (b) has not yet seen it, in which case the less you know about the plot, the more you will enjoy it when you do see it.  While this is a movie that you can thoroughly enjoy over and over, some of the surprises are especially good if you aren't sure what to expect.  So this comment will avoid any plot details at all.Although ""Psycho"" is usually remembered as a shocker, there is actually very little violence, and it is not especially graphic.  Its effect is maximized by skillful build-up and by the atmosphere that Hitchcock so carefully created.  The pacing is masterful, slowly building up the tension and only releasing it when it will have the maximum effect - that is why it creates such a sensation.  The main settings - the Bates Motel and the Bates' old house - are perfectly designed to create an atmosphere full of possibilities.  (Hitchcock also made a terrific trailer in which he took the viewer on a tour of the house and motel.)  And it is not possible to say enough about the famous Bernard Herrmann score, which always fits the mood and action perfectly.  The exciting music makes even the opening credits fun to watch.The fine cast is led by Anthony Perkins, who is simply outstanding in a very challenging role.  The movie would not have been quite the same without his underplayed but thoroughly memorable performance.  Janet Leigh is also particularly good as the kind of complex, mysterious woman that she excelled at portraying.All this together makes for one of the greatest of all movies, and a genuine must-see for any fan of quality cinema.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Debuted on Pittsburgh's Chiller Theater in February 1972,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" may well be the greatest motion picture ever made, certainly the best film that ever popped up on Pittsburgh's Chiller Theater during a time when availability was mostly left to the bottom half of drive-in double bills. Robert Bloch's original 1959 novel was inspired by the real life horrors perpetrated by Wisconsin necrophile Ed Gein, kidnapping his mother's corpse to care for it and despoiling other graves for food or souvenirs (Tobe Hooper's ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" expertly conveyed the sickening atmosphere of such depravity). In refashioning this normal looking, unsuspected farmer into Norman Bates, balding, alcoholic, middle aged proprietor of the Bates Motel built by his mother, the same events play out as in Hitchcock's adaptation, though despite living only 35 miles from Gein's hometown of Plainfield Bloch remained unaware of the actual crimes until it was almost completed (he was amazed at how similar the dynamic turned out to be living out in the country, a puritanical religious fanatic mother whose son acted out in much the same way as his fictional counterpart). Hitchcock purchased the rights for a pittance in an attempt to go against his recent history of big budget efforts with major stars for a small scale black and white production done by his television arm Shamley, apparently inspired by showman filmmaker William Castle. His chosen screenwriter was Joseph Stefano, listening intently to the director's changes with surprise and delight, shifting the initial focus not on Norman but on fugitive Marion Crane, in possession of $40,000 stolen to pay off her fiancee's debts so that they can marry. All Hitchcock had to do was suggest Anthony Perkins for Norman to engage the audience's sympathy, the up and coming 27 year old actor had already been nominated for an Oscar for only his second screen role in ""Friendly Persuasion,"" while casting Janet Leigh as Marion was even better, a lovely and versatile actress whose star qualities could carry the crucial early section and pull the viewers into her 'private trap' (she lost the Academy Award for Best Actress but did win a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress). Another masterstroke was personally appearing on all the posters with strict guidelines on how the film should be exhibited, no one to be admitted after the picture's start: ""I realize this is a revolutionary concept but we have discovered that PSYCHO is unlike most pictures and does not improve when run backwards!"" Topping that had to be the best tagline ever conceived: ""don't give away the ending, it's the only one we have!"" Filmed on the Universal backlot, where the Bates motel would be seen in several episodes of Boris Karloff's THRILLER, it was a reluctant pickup for Paramount to finish off a previous contract (put off by the violence and adult subject matter), not expecting much of a return under Hitchcock's restrictions and no advance screenings yet becoming the biggest blockbuster of his entire career from massive ballyhoo and word of mouth. He wanted to prove that a relatively minor feature from William Castle could have turned out much better with a decent director on a small investment, and in playing the audience like a piano succeeded beyond his wildest dreams...but where do you go from here? Transforming something perfectly ordinary into something terrifying was a challenge he always enjoyed, and would meet with ""The Birds."" And believe it or not, William Castle himself described his latest plot to screenwriter Robb White, who deemed ""Homicidal"" fairly impressive until he went to see ""Psycho"" and realized that this 'original' idea was a complete ripoff! John Gavin had not seen the last of the Bates Motel, both appearing in the very last episode of THE ALFRED HITCHCOCK HOUR in 1965, ""Off Season,"" directed by a young William Friedkin and scripted by none other than Robert Bloch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

First movie of the modern era,"Young audiences today no doubt find it hard to believe that a horror classic such as this could have been made without a thought toward youngsters going to see it. But PSYCHO was made when nearly all top quality directors were making movies routinely for adults. It would be another 8 or 10 years before studios would discover the youth market as perhaps an answer to their financial woes. Flash forward to the present when adults have to hunt for the elusive independent, unpublicized gems that are available today for them.
 Hence this thriller makes the audience wait 45 minutes for the first scare. That script would never get shot today. But when that scare came, it was a pip- killing the star off half way through! Something new had happened here, and Hitch became the first to insist no one be admitted to the theater after the movie had begun. At that time it was common for patrons to walk into movies at any time and stay to see the start of the next show up to the time they 
had come in. Hitch changed the way audiences went to the movies.
 It suddenly became okay for major stars and directors to develop nasty or violent projects that would always be a thorn in the side to conservative producers. Eight years after PSYCHO, Bonnie and Clyde would break new ground too with its technicolor bloodshed in that film.
 After all these years, it's still painful to decide which of his films is his best. Is it the cold brilliance of this, or the hauntingly beautiful tragedy of Vertigo - or the terrifying, inexplicable The Birds?",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Room Service, Please","Alfred Hitchcock guarded the plot of PSYCHO against publicity, and in 1960 audiences came to the film without being able to anticipate the unexpected twists and turns of the plot. More than forty years later, the movie's fame is such that even those who have not seen it are often able to sketch the basic outline of the story in a few words. This demonstrates the film's fame; what demonstrates it quality, however, is the fact that even those who know the plot before seeing it are seldom disappointed.Very loosely based on Robert Bloch's pulp novel, which was itself very loosely based on killer Ed Gein, PSYCHO presents us with the tale of Marion Crane (Janet Leigh)--who, in a moment of madness, steals forty-thousand dollars. Running scared, Marion checks into the out-of-the-way Bates Motel. And there, as production notes for the recent DVD release gracefully state, she becomes the most grossly inconvenienced hotel guest in cinema history.The late 1950s and early 1960s saw a deluge of low budget and badly made films that commanded box office business via tawdry subject matter, and according to lore director Alfred Hitchcock was curious to see what might happen if he himself made such a film--but made it well. Working with a remarkable script and gifted cast and crew, the result was a masterpiece. Although it is often described as a horror film, PSYCHO is less horror than it is a study in paranoia and suspense, and certainly a lesson in the fact that one need not bother with graphic gore or big budgets to impress audiences.Much of the film's success is in its detail. Joseph Stephano's script is memorable for its repetition of verbal motifs and its extremely disquieting tone; Bernard Herrman's famous all-strings score builds tremendously upon it. The simple yet meticulous sets communicate building unease, and the strangely flat, semi-documentary black and white cinematography has a voyeuristic edge that is extremely disturbing.There are elements that can be justly criticized--moments at which the script sounds a false note or characterizations seem a bit artificial--but these small points fade against the overall power of Hitchcock's vision, a vision that here makes viewers squirm even when there seems nothing tangible on screen to squirm about. But in the end, this is the film for which Janet Leigh, Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles, and John Gavin will forever be remembered... and one of the several films that will forever be associated with one of the twentieth century's most masterful directors.Gary F.

10/10,"Inside every tough guy there's a little psycho, and inside every psycho there's a teensy-weensy mother just waiting to jump out and grab a knife with her cold, dead hand (gulp). So celebrated British director Alfred Hitchcock would have us believe after watching his original psycho-drama of 1960.Born in London (Leytonstone), Al began in Silents, first directing rom-drams, then suspense (The-Lady-Vanishes The-39-Steps). Like many proven English makers, he'd cross the Pond, then the N. American continent to the USA's movie mecca, Hollywood, expanding his repertoire on makes like Mr-&-Mrs-Smith Rear-Window Rebecca Saboteur and Strangers-On-A-Train, eventually focusing his energies on one genre. And of his vast catalog, two films stand out, cementing his place atop the hierarchy of horror directors: Psycho (60) and The-Birds (63), both ingenious tales set in eerily everyday circumstance, the latter airing on 70s TV with frequency (What's a little eye-gauging and tortious bird behavior, anyway, right?), and Psycho, with its famous chef salad shower scene and weird mother-son dynamic, proving too graphic for censors who sometimes DID know best. But with cable's arrival (80s) and codes liberated, all of us finally got to check in the Bates Motel, assuming all risks and liabilities appurtenant (gulp).Psycho clearly crossed the line, but because it did so with style (Stefano & Bloch), its shocking visuals would change movies forever (how censors ever let it show in theaters is a small miracle, or deal made with the devil). Innovations in camera and edit, along with better developed characters fueling suspense, give it the edge over the feathered freak-show. It stars Anthony Perkins as charming but demented desk clerk Norman Bates in the role that made him as legendary as Hitchcock. Janet Leigh plays his gorgeous guest who jumps from the criminal frying-pan (APB) into the victim's fire, learning the hardest way possible that 'crime never pays!' Other contributors: lens-man John Russell (his frame and pull-back from the eye of a corpse is exquisite), music score by Bernard Hermann (the piercing note that powers the shower scene may be the most famous single tone in all of cinema) and editing by the highly under-rated George Tomasini (Rear-Window Stalag-17 Vertigo The-Misfits The-Birds The-Time-Machine).Missed the mark: 1) At first meet, Norman is too normal for what lay ahead, his ""mother"" and ""madness"" mentions a little too cute; 2) John Gavin's Sam is almost as weird as Norman, his attempts to fluster Bates enough to get the boyfriend tossed on his ear anywhere else, but then Loomis has his uses, and 3) I could've done without the last five minutes of psycho-splaining from the good doctor (Oakland) in prep for Bates' legal defense (incompetence in Arizona), and yet, still a masterpiece (4/4) (5.26.18).",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Horror that passed the test of time,"I don't think there's anything that hasn't been said about this movie yet. We all know the famous shower scene, we know the fact that chocolate syrup was used to imitate blood here and we're all so familiar with the wicked smirk our culprit gives at the end of the movie. I believe that nowadays most people know those things without even experiencing this movie. Yet what still makes it stand out and earns the movie it's place among all-time great movies?I think the answer to that is the unique way this movie is able to shock you. You kind of expect what will happen because of small hints that are present in the dialogue and the background but even when it happens, you are left in shock, I can't really think of any other movie that has this quality. Usually you're left disappointed if the movie is too predictable. Not here. As I mentioned before, you kind of have the idea what will happen, you kind of are right but the expected actions still have enough shock factor to leave you speechless.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Psycho,Alfred Hitchcock has done it again. Psycho has set the bar for horror films and its still a great film to watch in this day and age. The ways Hitchcock uses the different camera angles to build suspense is incredible. The way director Hitchcock uses sound to unleash a chilling sense of fear to the audience is magnificent. Psycho is a must watch if your interested in watching a suspenseful horror film. Vera Miles as Lila Crane does a great job in this film and her character is outstanding. The ability to create suspense and thrill is an art and Alfred Hitchcock does just that and more. I would recommend this film to anyone who appreciates a classic horror film.,8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"""A boy's best friend is his Mother.""","Alfred Hitchcocks' ""Psycho"" still stands tall as one of the most riveting shockers ever made. At the time, it was an interesting experiment for the director, having been filmed on a low budget and in black & white. It introduced characters and scenes that became an enormous part of the popular culture and influenced a GREAT many films that followed.Based on the novel by Robert Bloch (itself inspired by the exploits of real-life madman Ed Gein), it manages one of the absolute best twists in plot to be committed to film, making us believe it's about secretary Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) and her impulsive theft of her boss' clients' money, only to jerk the rug out from under us in a now legendary ""shower sequence"". Marion makes the fateful decision of seeking shelter in the way-out-of-the-way Bates Motel, run by peculiar young man Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), a seemingly wimpy person who's dominated by his shrewish Mother.It's a testament to how powerful and endlessly entertaining ""Psycho"" is, that it can continue to enthrall us no matter how many times we see it. Hitchcocks' murder set pieces are the kind you never forget, and they're made all the more so by the most infamous (and imitated) of all of Bernard Herrmanns' music scores. It really helps to drive the movie forward, and Hitch and company create some truly delicious atmosphere, especially when it comes to *that* house, looking sinister and foreboding up on its hill. Screenwriter Joseph Stefano does impressive things with dialogue and a top notch cast memorably brings the characters to life. Perkins is just tremendous in the role of Norman, so tremendous that the role and performance would loom large for the rest of his life and career. Vera Miles is wonderfully feisty as Marions' sister, who'll stop at nothing to find her, while John Gavin makes for a stoic hero. Leigh is winning in the role of the larcenous Marion and her scenes with Perkins are superb. Great character players like Martin Balsam, John McIntire, Frank Albertson, John Anderson, Mort Mills, and Simon Oakland round out the cast, while Hitchs' daughter Pat plays the role of Caroline.They all help to make watching this a rich experience, one that can look even better after repeat viewings, with elements (the bird imagery & references, for example) one might not fully appreciate on the first viewing. This is a movie milestone that everybody ought to see at least once.Followed by three sequels, the TV movie 'Bates Motel', a remake, and the 'Bates Motel' TV series.10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Classic Mystery!,"Psycho is definitely the best Hitchcock movie, and the best mystery movie of all time.  Maybe it's not a really scary movie, but it is great and dramatic.  It kept me guessing until the end.  The end scene had to be the scariest, much better than the infamous shower scene.  Anthony Perkins is brilliant, along with some other cast members.  It makes you think long after the movie.  I would give it *** out of four or a B+.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Hitchcock's Most Impactful Film!,"62 years after release, Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho remains the auteur's most impactful film. He made incredible thrillers such as Vertigo, North by Northwest, and The Birds, but can any of these pictures match the cultural and film impact this particular film had? Even though the major surprises have long been spoiled, this still remains a masterpiece in tension and manipulation. Some consider this to be the start of the slasher genre which of course allowed films such as 1978's Halloween to be produced. Hitchcock made some very bold directorial choices that stands the test of time...including murdering the protagonist about a third through the thriller. That shower scene remains one of the most effective murder scenes ever created. There are no knife cuts or wounds displayed. There is a little amount of blood as Hitchcock felt like the audience would not be ready for such gore, but Gus Van Sant later repudiated that fact in his shot-to-shot 1998 remake. Rather, Hitchcock used sharp editing techniques and various camera angles to full effect. Bernard Herrmann's score of screeching violins and cellos is the final straw that made this scene legendary. To this day, it remains one of the best scenes in cinema, in my personal opinion. It received mixed reviews upon release (mainly because critics were forced to see the film with an audience) but a reevaluation was much kinder. Without a doubt, this is Hitchcock's best film (out of many incredible films). There is no denying its impact on cinema as a psychoanalytical thriller. I was surprised to see how much analysis is out there.Paramount did not want the film to be made at all. They felt like the audience would not care for such a movie. Hitchcock shot the film for only $800,000, a low budget amount for this time frame. Instead of using a large crew, he used his Alfred Hitchcock Presents television crew to save money. He chose to shoot the film in black-and-white...which also helped the movie itself. It allowed the film to show less gore. The Bates Motel and house were built on the Universal backlot. Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins were bankable stars, but they had to take a major pay cut like Hitchcock did. Bernard Herrmann actually received a doubled salary because of his influential music. The director originally intended not to have music during the murder scene. We should all be thankful for Herrmann's insistence. Hitchcock got away with his picture being more sexual. In 1960, the Production Code was failing. Right away, in the opening scene, where Leigh and John Gavin are making love, that is proof that no one cared about the code. That also applies to the murder scene. There were only very few edits that the director had to made. So yes, the film is more sexual in nature when compared with Hitchcock's earlier films.Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is a Phoenix-based assistant who laments over the fact that she cannot marry her boyfriend, Sam Loomis (John Gavin) over his alimony payments. She finds an opportunity to steal $40,000 in cash from her boss's client and escape to California where she can marry Sam. She makes it very close to the border and decides to sleep for the night at Bates Motel run by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). Bates has had little business since they moved the state highway. He lives with his mother on the big house on the hill overlooking the hotel. Marion learns that his mother is a mad, controlling woman but Norman chalks it up to mental illness. She later decides to return the money to Phoenix...but never makes it. Sam, along with Marion's sister Lila (Vera Miles) and an investigator, Milton Arbogast (Martin Balsam) arrive at the hotel to make their own inquiries over Marion's disappearance. It is important to note that Norman's mother is very protective of her son.The performances are great throughout. Janet Leigh has never been better as she had a commanding screen presence. Anthony Perkins is great at garnering sympathy from the audience. Even though he commits the murders, there is much more to the truth. One could say that Norman becomes the protagonist after Marion Crane is out of the picture. That is analysis for another time. The supporting cast is wonderful. Martin Balsam is a great investigator!Even if you go into the film knowing every surprise, Psycho is a tense, melodramatic thriller with Alfred Hitchcock at his very best. I can only imagine the pure shock of the audience in 1960 seeing such vivid imagery for the first time. Hitchcock actually instituted a rule where no latecomers were allowed. Gee, wish that rule was in place for all movies. He made some very bold choices and he made every dollar in his limited budget count. The shower scene is one of the best scenes ever (Hitchcock purportedly used 60-75 different cameras to get the many shots needed so he could rapidly edit them together. Paramount had no intention of getting the film made yet through Hitchcock's perseverance, this is his best film (and that is saying something).My Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Enjoyed it,I haven't watched any film by Alfred Hichkock and this was my first one. So I was intrigued on how this film was going to be.Being considered as a classic I expected it to be really good and it was. There's not most to say about this film seeing everybody seems to agree with the fact that it's a great film. Although I've seen a lot of better films this was solid. There's not a lot of action in this film but I didn't find it too slow and it was well paced making the film intriguing compelling.

Slice of Genius,"Psycho is an undisputed classic that redefined the thriller and horror genres while cementing Alfred Hitchcock's status as the ""Master of Suspense."" With its groundbreaking narrative, iconic performances, and innovative direction, the film remains as hauntingly effective today as it was at the time of its release.Anthony Perkins delivers a career-defining performance as Norman Bates, masterfully blending boyish charm with a deeply unsettling undertone of instability. His portrayal adds layers to the character, making the shocking twists even more impactful and leaving an indelible mark on cinematic history. Janet Leigh's portrayal of Marion Crane is equally captivating, with her nuanced performance drawing audiences into a story that takes an unexpected and unforgettable turn.Hitchcock's direction is a masterclass in suspense. The iconic shower scene, with its rapid editing and Bernard Herrmann's piercing score, has become one of the most recognisable and influential sequences in film history. The decision to shoot in black-and-white enhances the film's stark, eerie atmosphere, creating a timeless quality that amplifies the tension and psychological unease.The pacing of Psycho is meticulous, gradually building tension through subtle visual and narrative cues. Hitchcock's ability to manipulate audience expectations culminates in one of the most shocking twists in cinema, a moment that remains unparalleled in its impact. The film delves into themes of identity, voyeurism, and psychological torment, all intricately tied to the unsettling backdrop of the Bates Motel.More than just a film, Psycho is a foundational work for modern horror and thrillers. Its influence is seen in countless films that followed, yet its perfect synthesis of psychological depth and raw suspense remains unmatched. Hitchcock's innovative approach to storytelling, including his handling of marketing and audience engagement, set new standards for the industry.With its groundbreaking direction, unforgettable performances, and lasting cultural and cinematic impact, Psycho continues to intrigue, shock, and inspire. It stands as a masterpiece that forever changed the landscape of filmmaking and remains a pinnacle of suspenseful storytelling.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Efficient creepy thriller from Hitchcock,"I watched PSYCHO last night on TV and during the movie I was never bored. PSYCHO is no doubt one of the best of Alfred Hitchcocks work. He filmed a very interesting novel that the film industry of nowadays misses so much if you know what I mean. Yes, it is one of the very first original creepy psycho thriller ever published.Each scene is accompanied with a well adapted music score. Then the camera-work is top and every character is well developed and performed. Anthony Perkins became in this genre the symbol of the perfect psycho killer and finally this role helped him to get a great star for eternity. What I didn't like therefore was the black and white cinematography. It would have been so nice to see those beautiful colors of the sixties.If you liked it watch THE BIRDS or REAR WINDOW from the same director.Final vote: 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Hidden meanings,"I read a college professor's thesis on Psycho years ago. I found it interesting, and I think of several of their ideas every time I see the film. Some of the more interesting ideas follow:1. It's Christmas time, and you see decorations when Marion is leaving town but the movie seems more like Halloween.2. When Marion is changing her clothes in her bedroom, you see her shower head peeking out...foretelling things to come.3. When she buys a newspaper, and folds the paper and puts it in her purse, the word ""OK"" is visible. This is particularly noticable when she is at the motel register.4. Her license plate is ""NFB"" aka Norman F. Bates.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The master of suspense is in full force here,"Welcome to the Bates Motel. 12 cabins, 12 vacancies. What are you doing here? Running from the police? Alright, well enjoy your stay and see you in the morning. Or maybe not. Alfred Hitchcock was one of the most influential and fiendishly wonderful movie makers of the twentieth century. Before ""Psycho"", I had seen exactly 22 of Hitchcock's pictures. Most of them I enjoyed but none of them were as memorable as this piece of work. It is not just a cinematic accomplishment but also of successfully portraying someone who is indeed psycho. This movie was a shock when released in 1960 because of the way the movie was laid out. For example, it was unthinkable for a main character to be killed so early in the film. The goal was to put the audience on edge to the point where they had no idea what would happen next. And Hitchcock indeed pulled it off. In fact, he was sure to make clear that no one would be admitted into the theater after the movie had begun. You must watch it from beginning to end. I am not going to tell you the plot because the less you know, the better. They don't call Alfred Hitchcock the master of suspense for nothing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Thrilling and chilling,"Psycho is one of the best thriller movies. It deserves its iconic place in movies history. Everything in this movies feels creepy. The lighting is foreboding. The strange camera angles give a sense of foreboding. The performance of Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates is what ties this film together. Bates' strange naivety yet obsessive personality is shown through his facial expressions alone. The way the tone of his voice changes when sensitive topics come up has a subtle brilliance. The film does have a few immersion breaking moments. The long overly long fall down the stairs, meant to increase suspense, instead reminds the viewer they are in fact just watching a movie. The quick explanation scene at the end breaks the mood as well. However, the film still thrills perfectly except for a very few short instances.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Scary and strange classic Hitchcock movie...,"1st watched 1/27/2009 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Alfred Hitchcock): Scary and strange classic Hitchcock movie provides plenty of reasons to watch and enjoy. Janet Lee plays a woman who decides to steal a large sum of cash and escape with it. The problem is she stops off to stay at the Bates Hotel overnight(which was definitely a mistake) and runs into the Bates family -- or at least it appears this way. Anthony Perkins is excellent as the disturbed son of the messed up family who covers up for his supposed mother's mistakes in the true good son fashion. The mystery behind the movie is determining who did the evils to Janet and others in the Bates Hotel. Hitchcock brilliantly keeps us guessing til the end as well as providing the shocks that we expect from the movie. This is the ultimate weird family scary movie that others have tried to imitate(some well and some badly), but they never match the excellent direction done by the master storyteller. There is the much imitated shower scene, but the overall movie in general is well written and put together and the one scene shouldn't make the entire movie(which it doesn't here).

Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho' - Classic Horror,"Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho' is arguably one of the most classic horror movies ever made. A great deal of iconography associated with the horror genre these days, for example eerie orchestral soundtracks and use of shadows and simplicity, appear to have originated in this movie.The narrative follows Marion, a young female secretary, who steals a large sum of money from her employer and runs away with the intent of building a new life with her lover. On her journey to her boyfriend's place of work, however, she decides against this action but as it is too dark to either go home or continue the journey she stops to spend the night at a motel. Namely the 'Bates Motel'...Many of the scenes that follow have become infamous in the world of cinema. When Marion is being shown to be stabbed in the shower very little is seen of the murderer and there is very little noticeable blood. Hitchcock clearly knew the way in which to create real horror is through what is NOT seen. Audiences' imaginations tend to scare them the most.The film continues to scare the audiences until the very last scene, which is unusual for a horror film. In typical, mediocre, horror films a new equilibrium is usually created and the horror dead or over. But although the film does typically end on a note of normality (albeit with characters having been murdered) Norman Bates is still alive and as creepy as ever, if not more than to begin with. The film works on a number of levels. It fulfils many different categories of horror, in the sense that it displays blood and murder, but also has psychological disturbances and thriller tendencies. It has continued to scare from the sixties to the present day and i am sure it will carry on scaring future generations to come.I am currently making a Horror Film Trailer for A Level Coursework and will try to feature many ideas from this film in my project! A classic horror film that could only be made by someone of Hitchcock's genius.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
F#ck Psycho,"Hitchcock may be one of the greats, but that's no excuse for doing sub par work and making a half-good movie. You can't do that, man. What reasons do I have for assaulting a classic? It's 1 in the morning, I'm not wearing pants, I have insomnia as a result of depression, and I thought that Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece make-you-wet-your-adult- diaper thriller was a load of horse manure.I first saw Psycho with my family one Halloween. I expected what the DVD case said: a thriller. What I got was not much in return. The story follows Marion Something who decides to rob her perfectly nice boss and go on the run with the money. Why? Doesn't matter. She is then pursued by a theorizing cop for a wholesome round of filler suspense. I wasn't embroiled in her life. I was bored. She then stops at a motel and after a long bout of small talk with the creepy care-taker, is murdered. I haven't marked this as a spoiler because it isn't one. It barely happens halfway through.I don't give a flying, enchanted sh!t about shocking the audience if it removes the stupid main character from the stupid movie. The rest of the movie is a detective (about whom I saw no reason to care) looking into Marion's disappearance and ultimately the wacky misadventures of Marion's sister and Marion's butt buddy Sam. THIS WEBSITE lists Marion as fourth in the cast and I'm expected to pay attention. I found myself disengaged from the story. I blame the screenplay. Upon closer inspection and after a second, forced viewing in film class, I saw that there was still three-act structure and an antagonist. There's even the first conflict between the protagonist and primary opposition at the middle as Dan Decker states in Anatomy of a Screenplay. I was still not interested and a movie can be uninteresting if it follows some of the rules. Ask yourself this: how much is actually known about Marion, Lila, or Sam?Psycho was expertly directed, shot, and edited. The shower scene lived up to its expectations. The ending was creepy and plot-twisty enough for me. But for all that, I still found that I didn't care. I hated this movie and the positive qualities didn't come up past the area that failed and is most important to me: story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Timeless Thriller,Psycho is an excellent thriller no horror fan should miss. Alfred Hitchcock knows how to create chills without gore. The film being in black and white also adds to the spooky mystique. Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins are perfectly cast. Leigh's character makes you sympathetic for her despite her criminal intentions and Perkins' portrayal of a serial killer ensnaring his prey is brilliant. I can't imagine why this film was remade in the 1990's --- the 1960 version is just so perfect that I wouldn't change a thing.Overall I recommend this film. It's so good you'll want to watch it twice in a row.,,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!,"Before I get started with my review of Psycho (1960), I need to start off by saying that I first watched this movie back at college for my Film as an Art Form Class and I instantly loved this movie. Now in 2024, I can tell you that Psycho (1960) is my favorite movie of all time.Positives for Psycho (1960):
The first thing I need to talk about with this movie are the performances from the actors. First off, you have Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates and this is easily one of the greatest acting performances in the history of cinema. The way how Anthony Perkins manages to make you sympathize for this man who at first feels trapped to care for his mother while also turning the dial when he needs to be unhinged at the right moments is something that needs to be watched and experienced by everyone. The fact that this man wasn't even nominated for an Oscar is easily the biggest crime in all cinema because he deserves it. You also have Janet Leigh, the mother of Jamie Lee Curtis, as Marion Crane and she is also very good at making you feel sympathy for her situation while also feeling conflicted with her decisions in the movie. I also loved that she is hearing the conversations between her co-workers and boss back in Arizona as of they are happening at that very moment. I can also say the same for Vera Miles as Lila Crane, John Gavin as Sam Loomis, Martin Balsam as Private Investigator Milton Arbogast, John McIntire as Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers, Simon Oakland as Dr. Richmond, Frank Albertson as Tom Cassidy, Patricia Hitchcock as Caroline, Vaughn Taylor as George Lowery, Lurene Tuttle as Mrs. Chambers, John Anderson as California Charlie, Mort Mills as the Highway Patrol Officer and Jeanette Nolan as the voice of Norma Bates. Of course as always, the direction and execution by Alfred Hitchcock is done masterfully here to where he gets the auidence to feel the emotions they're supposed to be feeling during every scene in this movie. The movie's musical score by Bernard Herrmann is absolutely phenomenal and easily one of the best scores in the history of cinema. Also, this movie contains what is easily the greatest set piece in all of cinema with the shower death scene. This scene is also the greatest kill sequence in any horror movie I've ever seen in my life to where you feel like you're in the scene with Marion as she is being ""stabbed"" by ""Mother"". Also, I have to give props to Alfred Hitchcock for this sequence, because killing off Janet Leigh, who was a big name actress at the time, was a phenomenal subvertion of expectations for the auidence back in 1960. I also have to give props to this movie for being the godfather of the slasher subgenre within the horror genre. The big twist of Norman Bates being revealed to be his mother and her being dead this whole time is easily the greatest plot twist in any movie I've ever seen in my life and the explanation for that reveal is done with an entertaining and fun exposition scene that is performed brilliantly by Simon Oakland as Dr. Richmond. And finally, the final monologue by Mother is one of the most creepy and haunting endings to any movie I've ever seen in my life.Overall, Psycho (1960) is not only my favorite movie from Alfred Hitchcock, not only is it my favorite horror movie of all time, but it is my favorite movie of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Classic Hitchcock,"Pros: Janet leigh, Cinematography, Directing, Score.Cons: Janet leigh is in only half the movie.Psycho isn't Hitchcock's best movie (the honor belongs to rear window) but probably the master of suspense most suspenseful and ultimately scary. Janet leigh plays a secretary who steals for the sake of her boyfriend and is on the run from the law. She happens upon the bates motel and is promptly murdered before the night is done. Bernard herrmann provides a masterful score matched by hitchcock's camera work. Hitchcock's movies tends to have a twist and psycho is probably the best out of all his movies. Only vertigo comes close. Anthony Perkins should have won an oscar for his portrayal of Norman Bates as he is the real star of the film. It gets a bit corny at the end.Premise: The death of a young woman leads to an investigation into the bates motel.Psycho was nominated for four Academy awards and is a winner of the AFI top 100 movies.Grade: 9.7/10 (One of the best thrillers of all time)",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Released in 1960, Psycho opened the door for many films in the thriller/slasher/horror genre that would follow. Psycho indices you from beginning to end. Each scene has your heart racing increasingly faster as the film progresses and for a different reason each time. This film draws you in to one situations and then turns you around right into another before you can even realize. Hitchcock masterfully pieces this
unique story together. I felt Psycho came across as a very complete movie, captivating performances, appealing cinematography, an unsettling score, and just the ability to draw you in is all pretty remarkable. The score alone is enough to make to shutter a little and it is paired up with every scene perfectly. The shots Hitchcock provides have a way of putting the films situation into perspective for the audience. It makes you feel part of the story and takes you on an intensified journey of angst and curiosity. Psycho's performances were convincing all around, but the real gem of this cast is Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates. Perkins performance is the backbone of Psycho, Norman Bates is a genuinely chilling character with a lot more too him than just simply being strange. The concept of Norman Bates and his mother adds to this films uniqueness and disturbing feel. 100% recommend, especially to horror/thriller fans who have been holding out.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
My Psychotic Love for this Movie,"Psycho... What can I say of the greatest thriller ever made? Only repeating what others before me have said time and time again. This is absolutely brilliant no other movie can depict such horror and schizophrenic thriller that could not possibly be remade successfully as the genius Mr Alfred Hitchcock could.Horror today is all over the place with poor production, poor storytelling, poor filmmaking and everything else that is wrong with them. What they don't understand is that the best horror movies need the process that Psycho takes, not just gore and bloodshed but story, emotion and Psycho is how it is done right.The perfect character development, perfect pace, excellent characters and casting and the most shady villain of all cinema history.If you haven't seen it. Watch it. Anyone that wants to study film needs to watch this and learn what true horror is and if only producers would look at this and make horror today like it was in the old days because it truly is horror and thriller at its best.Grade: A+ Comment: Horror made right.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Psycho,"Psycho was a fast paced, and very well thought out movie. It had a variety of different shots and angles using weird points of view that would become stranger as the tension mounted. The tension was on and off, and every time it felt like it was about to break, they would switch to a calmer scene, and then switch back to the tense one. The constant change made the movie exciting to watch. Another thing I noticed were that almost every character felt like a REAL character. Most of the characters had lines or at least some interaction with the film. It kept pace until a smooth end with all the loose ends tied up. I though this movie really displayed Hitchcocks abilities both in suspense and in cinematography.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Terrible love,"I have met this movie for the first time. I felt that this movie was the kind of horror all the time, because in a play the multiple murder were repeated and the fact of matter wasn't shown at the end. Moreover, the sound track gave us the feeling of impatience and tension.I think that ""Psycho"" and ""Vertigo"" have something in common with women. In ""Vertigo"" Scottie tried to appropriate Madeline for his personal use by making ideal woman. Whereas in ""Psycho"" there is the description comparing women to stuffed birds from Norman's lines. I felt that these express the men's will wanting to make women their own. I wonder if women are passive compared with men is really the case.Also, this film shows strange relationship of gender, because Norman and his mother have the reference of incest in Norman's brain. Of course mother and son are not lover but family by thinking about blood relationship from commonsense. So the love of between parent and child is ""abnormal"". That unusual love invaded Norman's spirit and ate in his heart. That sounds like so terrible.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"If there's a 10 star movie, this would be it.","This has gotta be my favorite Hitchcock movie. Something timeless oozes from this movie - unlike Vertigo, the other movie which Hitchcock made which just about every film afterwards has taken at least -something- from, Psycho does not feel dated, keeps you guessing in all of the important ways.I wish more films tried to do what this film did, instead of trying to be what it was.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
10/10,"Psycho was a very original horror in 1960 when people were mostly scared by ghosts, aliens or monsters. But the real terror lied in people.That's why it came as something new and refreshing; choosing a man as the villain for a horror-slasher was certainly a brave decision that was viewed dubiously by the film's producers. In fact, it worked out very well and the film was a massive success that put it straight to number 1 in the best horrors ever made.There are 2 ways the movie can be perceived- as a psychological analysis of family trauma, the duality of the human being and the fight between good and evil, or as an intriguing tale of murder and mystery, pumping with adrenaline and suspense until the last few minutes. Psycho works best when it's about action and mystery, rather than characters and their psychologies.Hitchcock is, indeed, the master of suspense and he proves it in almost every film he makes - terror and fear are in the air, but that's precisely because you have no idea what Norman Bates is going to do next - the moments when you don't know what he's thinking are the most successful because no logical explanation can suffice for his actions. That's why the final twist, along with the psychiatrist's presentation of events make you chuckle a little, the terror turns to some amusement and the story becomes a little unbelievable and exaggerated.The ending is kind of laughable, but the rest of the movie is horror at its best.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I can see why it was so groundbreaking!,"All I can say is that I could not keep my eyes off of this movie! Hitchcock pulled out all stops for his masterpiece. There was theft, lying, provocativeness with a female character, murder, and psychological trauma for everyone involved, both characters and viewers alike. What was most captivating about the whole film, however, would have to be Alfred Hitchcock's use of close up shots which showed the true fear and anxiousness within each character of the film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Psycho Review,Psycho directed by Alfred Hitchcock was an amazing thriller movie. Hitchcock kept you on the edge of your seat throughout the whole movie. This movie is flawless and the cinematography is perfect. Using the shadows and covering up the killer in the shower scene was perfect. It couldn't get any better. The shower scene is one of the best scenes I've ever seen in any movie. The camera zooms in as she showering to the shadowy figure in the background. Then he opens the curtain and the score music comes on which was perfect and fit so well. While he is stabbing her his whole figure is still hidden and you can't see his face. Then he leaves the bathroom as she's dying and the camera is just focused on her hand as she is slowly dying. It was perfect and just gave me that weird feeling. I loved it. That scene describes a horror movie perfectly. The acting job too during that scene was great. She made it look so realistic and it was spectacular.,10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Definitive Hitchcock.,"The definitive film from Hitchcock's library that just does not age at all. It is probably more terrifying and disturbing now than it was over 40 years ago. Janet Leigh (Oscar-nominated) seems like an ordinary woman, but she has a few skeletons in her closet: she is having an affair with a married man and she takes it upon herself to take a large sum of money from the bank where she works. A frantic getaway is now the only option, but the weather impedes her progress. Maybe a stay in the Bates Motel is what she needs. Enter suspicious inn-keeper Anthony Perkins and his unseen elderly mother who torments him. Trouble awaits for Leigh now. Sister Vera Miles becomes worried after Leigh's disappearance and Leigh's boyfriend also joins the search (John Gavin). The search leads to the spooky Bates Motel and the suspense builds. Private investigator Martin Balsam also joins the search but no one's safety is assured. Hitchcock is in top-form here all the way. The film is tense and it wraps itself around the audience. Definitely trail-blazing and definitely a classic, ""Psycho"" is one of the cinema's best productions from any era. 5 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"""Is your time so empty?""","Psycho is a very strong, suspenseful film. Despite it being 60 years old it's still engageable, and fun to watch. And of course, it features the famous shower scene, which holds up pretty well, mainly due to the violin score in the background. Norman Bates as a villain is very disturbing, and the twist is sure to send chills down one's spine.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
For that time one of the best from Hitchcock.,"I watched Psycho again after so many years and it still remains a classic. Maybe youngsters from now won't think much about this movie in these modern ages. But I watched it again bearing in my mind how it was in the sixties. And you got to admit that for that time this thriller was really top notch. Even though I knew the whole storyline this time, and so the surprises are not working like they should be, it stills stays an enjoyable movie to watch. I remember the first time I watched it that I loved the twists in this movie. Anthony Perkins is perfect in his role and he will be remembered for this movie for ages. A masterpiece from Alfred Hitchcock, a classic in his genre.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
This Movie Changed the Way I Viewed Cinema,I saw this movie for the first time when I was 12 years old and it sparked the passion i have today about movies and TV. Alfred Hitchcock's directing is at its best in this film. I only need to mention the shower scene and the final shot of the movie to prove my point. Psycho sets a creepy and often unsettling atmosphere throughout the movie and Alfred Hitchcock shows the audience that he is in full control of his craft. Psycho can feel slow at times but it is definitely worth it and just adds to the tension of the film. Anthony Perkins gives the performance of his career as the now legendary character of Norman Bates as well as Janet Leigh as Marion Crane. Psycho even though it was made in 1960 can still make the audience feel uneasy even today and is truly a staple of the horror genre.,10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Wonderful! Brilliant! Genius! Fantastic! PERFECT!,"I just finished watching ""Psycho"" on TV about an hour ago, and I am still in awe. This is easily Hitch's best film ever...maybe THE best film ever. I can say this, and A) I am under 17, and B) I didn't see the whole thing. I started watching it when Janet Leigh was getting ready to leave about fifteen minutes in.Terrific, flawless acting and directing jobs are done here. WHY DIDN'T IT WIN ANY OSCARS? I have repeatedly been asking myself this question. The adapted screenplay was awesome as well, and the ending was ABSOLUTE GENIUS (but I'm not gonna tell you what it is). My ten-year-old brother had to leave in the middle of the movie, so we taped about the last half hour (yea, I get to watch it again!), and he liked what he's seen. Now I just have to not tell him the ending...One minor note, though: Viewers everywhere think it's a mistake that there was blood all over the wall after the shower scene, and when Norman Bates comes in there isn't. Hello, wasn't the shower still on? It could have washed off the blood.Overall, brilliant, and yes, perfect. I have to write a novelette for literature class, and I will no doubt use ""Psycho"" as a guide to write a murder mystery. *************and more out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Psycho is literally a watershed, because, in fact, the viewer is treated to not one, but two very different films. A classic that consolidated several clichés of the genre","In terms of narrative, Psycho is literally a watershed, because, in fact, the viewer is treated to not one, but two very different films. The first one stars Janet Leigh, playing secretary Marion Crane. We see her, in a bra, in bed with her boyfriend in a risqué scene for the time that was hotly debated by censors still clinging to the Production Code. The two don't have the money to get married and Marion suddenly decides to steal $40,000 from her boss and flees Phoenix, Arizona, driving.Hitchcock makes us follow Marion's escape in detail, approaching the character with an invasive camera, close to her face, in medium and close-up. We became the girl's accomplices and began to suffer for her, in a way sympathizing with her actions. Her saga continues when she is woken up by a police officer after spending the night sleeping in her car by the side of the road. Then she decides to get rid of the car and a restless buy and sell negotiation ensues, again with the cop lurking. Marion feels the world close in around her and we feel it with her. The journey continues and Marion, in the rain, deviates from the road and stops at a motel - yes, the Bates Motel - to spend the night, because, in addition to being tired and not seeing anything with the storm, she has doubts about the act. Committed and begins to rethink the theft. She is then taken care of by an attentive young man, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), who owns the motel, and who lives with his mother in a nearby house, who puts her in the first room, near the lobby. Marion then goes to take a shower. She seems to want to clean up the mess she's made. There is a subtext of regret, of the cleansing brought by the water.And it's at this point that Hitchcock pulls our rug and presents the biggest plot twist of all time, with a lady - presumably Norman's jealous mother - mercilessly stabbing Marion to death in one of those sequences that, once seen, will never be forgotten, with Herrmann's soundtrack, loaded with strings and a lot, but a lot of tension (to the point that Herrmann's credits in the film immediately predate Hitchcock's!), despairing us. The audience at the time must have been bewildered by the surprise and completely confused by a simple fact that can be boiled down to a question: the protagonist died and now?Aided by Joseph Stefano's great script, Hitchcock brilliantly breaks the narrative axis, shocking the viewer. A confusion settles in our minds at this time. What would the story be like now? The conventional structure of the films is broken, changing the entire focus of the narrative. John L. Russell's brilliant photography helps create an essential trick to the plot's suspense. Notice how, in the famous scene, the play of light and shadows hides the main features of Mrs. Bates' face and the revelation of her face only happens in the last act. In this way, we have the tip, but not the solution for the case. George Tomasini's excellent editing is also essential in building the suspense. The rapid switching of images further enhances the impact of the bathtub scene. His talent can also be seen in the final scene, which perfectly synchronizes the various parallel actions that culminate in the monumental scene in which the identity of the assassin is revealed.Two other moments are essential for the viewer not to discover the plot solution ahead of time. The first is when Detective Arbogast sees Mrs Bates at the window of the house and is then approached by Norman Bates in front of the Hotel. The second happens when Sheriff Chambers (John McIntire) tells Sam and Lila (Vera Miles) that Mrs. Bates died ten years ago. In the next shot, we can see the door to Mrs. Bates and hear her and Norman talking. Next, we see Norman carrying his mother down to the basement. Despite never showing her face, Hicthcock practically nullifies in our minds the possibility that Norman and his mother are the same person. The director also creates visually interesting sequences, such as the dry cut from the drain plane to the dead Marion's eye plane. Through a tracking shot, he leaves the girl's eye, passes the money on the dresser and ends the scene with a distant shot of the house. This move is not done by accident. The director wants to show the whole crime scene, to set us up and remember everything that is involved in that murder.Psycho was the film responsible for one of the most famous and well-known murder scenes in movie history, when the character Marion Crane is surprised by the psychopath in the bathroom, while taking a shower. Technically, this sequence generated a huge amount of work (especially considering the time of production), taking a week to make, with 70 camera positions for just 45 seconds of film. The montage of several small scenes together, in charge of the technician Saul Bass (also creator of the initial signs of the film) had a disturbing effect, resulting in the illusion of violent blows from the murderer's knife, and where we can clearly see that it does not penetrate the body. By actress Janet Leigh.Another classic scene is also the murder of Detective Arbogast on the steps of the mansion where Norman Bates lived. Using a different technique, Hitchcock achieved an interesting effect by filming only the frightened and bloodied face of actor Martin Balsam, who was descending the stairs in a special chair, frantically waving his arms. In fact, the Gothic-looking house used by the production as a model for the construction of Bates' mansion actually exists, located in Kent, Ohio. The soundtrack, by Bernard Herrmann, is one of the best known and most consecrated in the history of horror and suspense cinema, especially in the part of the famous murder scene in the shower, with an impressive sequence of high-pitched and strident violins that they further intensified the atmosphere of tension and agony already existing between the murderer and his victim. The musician Herrmann was one of Hitchcock's great collaborators, forming a partnership with him responsible for nine films.Hitchcock delivers a great suspenseful plot from the start. Marion's drive between the bank and the motel is a claustrophobic driving lesson (in a good way). The character is consumed with guilt from the moment she steals the money, which doesn't stop her from continuing her journey. However, at every moment she is stunned in her mind with the consequences of her criminal act, wondering what her boss, her sister and even her own boyfriend would say if they found out what she did. Panic increases even more when she is intercepted by a suspicious police officer who interrogates her on the road and afterwards, in a great clash between desire and guilt.Janet Leigh's characterization should also take a closer look. If at the first moment we see her in intimate clothes, her clothing is white, as if portraying a certain purity of her character, after the robbery, she wears dark tones, which indicates her option for the ""bad path"", so to speak. Her redemption takes place at the motel, when she undresses fully, she rips up a compromising note and throws it in the toilet, as if to rid herself of her guilt. Naked, in the shower (fateful moment), with the shower squirting water on her face, it's the moment of total freedom. A freedom, however, that goes beyond death, explained by the horror of more than 70 frames in the montage of the stab wounds that end Marion's life.Norman Bates' construction is impeccable. Perkins presents us with a performance full of layers, which deepen and bring us closer to his character in addition to convincing everyone between the lines in his way of acting or even in his expression. At no time do we doubt the overwhelming power that the character has, and we are peeling away his submissive personality to his mother, of someone capable of hiding a crime to protect those he loves. And, as we go along, we are introduced to one of the best plots in history, as we understand the picture as a whole, giving us another unforgettable moment of cinema. It is no wonder that the figure of Perkins was so linked to Norman, shocking us with the mastery of his performance added to a powerful rhythm that marked everyone.Psycho would be the perfect murder thriller were it not for its ending. And I'm not talking here about solving the Marion murder plot. It does so flawlessly, with a round script, brilliant performances, precise direction and haunting soundtrack. I'm actually talking about the final three minutes in which Hitchcock doesn't shy away from presenting viewers with a detailed, but extremely artificial and ultimately unnecessary explanation of Norman Bates' insanity. He is trapped in a cell, but a forensic psychiatrist enters the sheriff's office and, speaking to Lila and Sam, explains everything the viewer already knows. Nothing is left for doubt or for discussion. Norman Bates is unveiled, laid bare in a version for dummies of all the sensational work that came immediately before.Perhaps it was an extreme insecurity due to the fact that the director had invested his money in the production that had been left aside by Paramount and that even had its distribution sabotaged. But the fact is that the ending is there, unfortunately, an example of ""amateurism"" in a work that would otherwise be worthy of a standing ovation. I recognize that maybe this statement is an exaggeration, but notice how the whole sequence is completely at odds with what came before. There is relatively little dialogue in the film and all the explanation we need has already been precisely provided by Hitchcock in the sequences that take place inside Bates' ""haunted mansion"". Repetition tires and calls viewer's idiots almost literally.Psycho is a timeless classic that, for better or worse, inspired (along with Rosemary's Baby) a series of films focused on horror and suspense and consolidated several clichés of the genre.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Antiheroine steal thousands and goes on the run, takes refuge in the Bates Motel (briefly)Rather than just simply rehash the plot, like 12 billion other reviewers, I'll comment on two of my favourite scenes in this movieAs Marion chats with Bates over sandwiches that evening, we never really feel like there is any connection between the two. She is afraid of being found out, but so is Bates, so they do actually have something in common. They are both putting on a show for the other, pretending to have nothing to hide. Antiheroine and villain, conversing over sandwiches, sitting under watchful eyes of taxidermied animals. We don't see them in the same frame either which makes them both seem even more distant, detached.Another favourite scene is Bates' thin frame standing at the edge of the lake, silently contemplating Arborgast's death, as his car slowly sinks into the muddy Waters.

A different kind of fear,"Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 masterpiece does not instill fear in you like the modern horror flicks (using shock tactics), but instead subtly introduces it to you throughout the film.

But only Hitchcock can use the rules then to construct a masterpiece, that even now, can cause that lingering fear to creep up on you.I enjoyed the Norman Bates portrayed by Perkins - he is the original and will always be the best Norman Bates there is. The use of 'scary' imagery - spooky house on  top of a hill sihouletted by lightning behind, etc...some call it crude, but in Hitchcock's hands, it is dynamite.Rent it if you've never watched the original (you haven't?!?!), you won't regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Still the greatest horror movie today!,"Psycho was directed by Alfred Hitchcock and was released on June 16th 1960. It was such an iconic scene which made Hitchcock known as a master of making such a horror masterpiece. It wasn't just a horror movie, it was also a thriller and a mystery which made us really curious about the crimes. We always wanted to know who commited it, who was the victim and what clues were left behind.
It was about a Phoenix secretary embezzles forty thousand dollars from her employer's client, goes on the run, and checks into a remote motel run by a young man under the domination of his mother. Hitchcock's Studio, Paramount Pictures, wasn't sure enough and disliked the film so they denied him a proper budget and the it was $800,000. The movie was in black and white. They even built a Bates Motel mansion at Universal. Psycho was Hitchcock's best work while he had done some thrillers and horrors like Rear Window (1954), Vertigo (1958) and The Birds (1963). All of those were one of Hitchcock's greatest works.
Hitchcock also made rules for audiences for watching this film.
""You must see PSYCHO from the very beginning. Therefore, do not expect to be admitted into the theatre after the start of each performance of the picture. We say no one -- and we mean no one -- not even the manager's brother, the President of the United States, or the Queen of England (God bless her)!""
-Alfred Hitchcock-
They were really strict and lucky for me, I'm not a person from the 60s so I can watch whenever I want.
The performances were excellent and I mostly like Anthony Perkin's role of Norman Bates. Perkins was good-looking and that's exactly how Hitchcock wanted it to be just like that so Bates would look like a very likeable person with a charming character and made audiences believe him. They would think about him. Bates even disguised before he kill so that the victims would think it wasn't Bates maybe? He could have not dress because the victims would be dead and they wouldn't know. The way the iconic scene: the shower scene was pretty scary with its noise and when Marion Crane opened her eyes dying made the scene more terrifying and the way she was buried in the swamp was mostly frightening. She was naked and her things were in there. I knew it would be a good idea to bury your victim like that. What a genius! The story was told in a unique way. Even though the movie didn't have much violence, but the mystery were also dreadful and made us worry about what really had happened. It's also a great idea to shoot this movie not in technicolor but still remained black and white. That way would make Psycho a horror masterpiece no one could make like that.
Psycho was really influential, the greatest work of Alfred Hitchcock and also the greatest horror movie and it still deserved that title until today, it's still terrifying and scared a lot of audiences. It's also a combination of horror, terror, violence, mystery and thriller. I would recommend this a must-see for horror fans.My ratings: 9.7/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"""Why, she wouldn't even harm a fly""","""Psycho"" is a masterpiece. It's not my subjective thought, I think it's objective that Psycho has revolutionized the world of cinema. Yesterday evening, November 7, 2024, I saw this film, from 1960, and it did not seem to me to see a movie released in cinema 64 years ago, except for some details that are irrelevant. The thing to do when you watch a film that is very old compared to today, to feel like someone who was watching the film at that time, thinking about what standards were there before. Hitchcock has turned the thriller genre with this film, but also the world of cinema. The plot is perfect and in fact nowadays more and more films are being created based on mental illnesses. The film is about Marion, a real estate agent's secretary, who one day snatches a large sum of money from a buyer and runs away in search of a new happy life when she comes across the gloomy motel run by Norman Bates, an apparently unsettling young man. The extraordinary thing about the film is also the level of the actors: Anthony Perkins is simply fabulous and Janet Leigh, John Gavin and all the others were great. The soundtrack of Bernard Herrmann is fabulous and still today many people pick up its melody because it's perfect for the genre. This is the first film of Hitchcock that I see and now I understand why everyone calls it one of the best directors if not the best: perfect shots, good images being that it is about 1960, sound section that does not seem at all of those times, Perfectly chosen costumes, use of lights and shadows perfect, sublime setting. I would say that defects I have not seen any. Also, one of the advantages of this film is that it lasts really little compared to most films today but the great observation is that time flies, it's not boring at all. I have already ordered the dvd and can't wait to see this masterpiece again..

A Masterclass in Suspense That Set the Tone for Thrillers,"This isn't just a movie - it's a watershed moment in film history that revolutionized the thriller genre and cinema as a whole. Shot in stark black and white when color films were becoming the norm, this artistic choice proves masterful in creating an atmosphere of mounting dread and psychological unease.Anthony Perkins delivers a career-defining performance as Norman Bates, the quietly peculiar proprietor of the Bates Motel, while Janet Leigh shines as Marion Crane, a woman whose fateful stop at this roadside establishment sets the story in motion. The chemistry between these two characters during their famous parlor scene is a masterclass in subtle tension.Bernard Herrmann's iconic screeching violin score deserves special mention - it's impossible to imagine the film without it. The music doesn't just accompany the scenes; it pierces through them, becoming a character in its own right.Hitchcock's direction is at its most innovative here. His camera work is deliberate and methodical, teaching future generations of filmmakers how to build suspense through careful framing and pacing. The film's influence on modern horror and thriller genres cannot be overstated.What makes ""Psycho"" particularly remarkable is how it manages to be thoroughly unsettling without relying on graphic violence by today's standards. Instead, it plays with your mind, making you an unwitting participant in its psychological game.Technical aspects aside, ""Psycho"" remains as effective today as it was in 1960. It's a testament to Hitchcock's genius that even modern audiences, desensitized by decades of horror films, still find themselves gripping their armrests during key scenes.Bottom Line: An essential piece of cinema history that deserves its status as one of the greatest films ever made. If you haven't seen it, you're missing out on a pivotal moment in movie-making that continues to influence filmmakers today.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
THE MOVIE THAT STARTED IT ALL,"I've never heard about the movie, ""psycho"" til my teacher made us watch it. The movie was great and a very over the edge movie. Alfredo Hitchcock did an amazing job not going stepping too much over the line. Very good screenplay, acting, camera shots. This must be hitchcock's most best film. i feel like if hitchcock was alive today he would still have one of the best movies in the industry, especially since everything is different now from it was back then. i'm glad that i got to watch this film cause i learned a lot from hitchcock. i would recommend this movie for any of my peers or family. i would watch this movie over and over again for its that good.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of the most thrilling titles ever made.,"I suppose it's quite peculiar that I only saw 'Psycho' after seeing around a dozen other Hitchcock titles, given that it's his best- known film. As I pressed 'play', I made the mistake of assuming that it'd just be a seminal slasher film, lacking the complexity of other Hitchcock titles such as 'Rebecca' and 'Vertigo'. I'm glad to say that I was wrong. The score was perfect, and I'm not just talking about the piercing shrieks of the legendary shower scene. It remains amongst the most iconic in cinema, and is just as foreboding as John Williams' score for 'Jaws'. Another winning feature of Hitchcock's horror is the excellent acting. I hadn't heard much about Anthony Perkins prior to watching 'Psycho', and so I was sceptical as to how he could portray a villain as iconic as Hannibal Lecter and Darth Vader. His acting talents shine from the first scene in which he appears, though, and Perkins delivers a truly outstanding performance as the crazed motel manager, Norman Bates. The performances of Janet Leigh, Vera Miles and the other actors in 'Psycho' are just as good as Perkins'.The twists and plot developments delivered in the film are similarly brilliant. After the shower scene, I wasn't sure that the film could surprise me or really offer me much, but I was – once again – surprised. The level of danger perceived in 'Psycho' is much greater than that in many other Hitchcock titles, and I never thought that a 55-year-old film could grip me like this did. The brilliant director's other titles were certainly thrilling, but the threats facing actors such as James Stewart, Joan Fontaine and Tippi Hedren seemed either relatively minor ('Rear Window'; 'Rebecca'), more intriguing than dangerous ('Vertigo'; 'Suspicion'), or even comical ('The Birds'). 'Psycho' could not be dismissed in this manner, and I found the plight of Vera Miles and Janet Leigh just as intense as Jodie Foster's in 'The Silence of the Lambs', if not more so. At points, Alfred Hitchcock's iconic horror was creepier than 'Rosemary's Baby' and more shocking than 'The Exorcist', and the director accomplishes this without delving into the supernatural or paranormal. I'd go so far as to say that this title is one of the greatest films ever produced, and it certainly ranks as my favourite Hitchcock title at the moment. Upon watching 'Psycho', you'll realise how even acclaimed thrillers such as 'Se7en' and 'Misery' pale into passivity.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Still a Masterpiece,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" isn't just one of his best thrillers, or simply one of the best horror films, it's also one of the greatest movies ever made.

The Perfect Horror Film,"Psycho is a ""less is more"" type of film. The minimal budget allotted to Hitchcock made him simpler and more restrained in his film-making. This allowed the story and acting to shine through instead of the big names and huge flair of earlier films like North by Northwest. Janet Leigh is stunning as Marion Crane and ensures that we remember what little screen time she has. The rest of the supporting cast is memorable to a point and adds emotional depth to the story; however, it is Anthony Perkins who steals the show. His performance as Norman Bates is one of the most stunning performances of all time. Perkins also hides the film's twist well throughout the entire movie, adding to Psycho's suspense. The score by Bernard Herrmann is excellent and adds incredibly to the suspense, especially during the infamous shower scene. That single scene is perhaps the defining scene of Hitchcock's career. It not only serves as the single catalyst for the plot, it also shows the attention to detail he gave to his movies. Psycho is the best horror film ever made for its reliability on every other factor besides gore to create suspense. It revolutionized the genre, along with Hitchcock's career, to be more focused on substance rather than style.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Masterpiece,A masterpiece in the genre of horror. So if you are confused about watching it because you have a prejudice because its an old movie please beat this prejudice.

INCREDIBLE,"Hitchcock was a very brave man. He fronted the $800,000 budget himself, and the film took in more than $40,000,000!!! And it is no wonder why it was such a huge success. The novel was incredible, and Joseph Stefano's script did a great job of telling the story. The sad thing about it was that it is based on a true event. The People of Plainfield, Wisconsin might remember about Ed Gein. I'll spare people's stomach fluids and not tell you the details. But this movie has all the classic Hitchcock elements.

Hitchcock's masterpiece,"I've only seen one other Hitchcock film (The Birds, pretty bad) but Hitchcock made a masterpiece here, Psycho is a film that once you see once, you never forget, I just got done watching it and I can say it's one of the best horror films that has ever been made.Psycho set the bar for suspense and filmmaking, Hitchcock really lived up to the name of the master of suspense, it's white-knuckled and one of the most suspenseful films I've ever seen.Psycho reignited and pretty much started the slasher genre and for good reason, it's something audiences in the 60's weren't used to and even in 2022 it absolutely chilled me.Anthony Perkins's performance is next-level, one of the creepiest performances I've ever seen any actor give, the shower scene is still iconic and there's been much discussion about the film's final twist.For good reason too, Psycho has one of the best twist endings in any movie ever, it really gets under your skin and the final shot is haunting, it also has some of the most beautiful shots in film history.The musical score is also iconic and incredible, this film's story is simple but unravels and eats away at you.Psycho continues to be thrilling to this day, and I'm gonna give it an A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Fantastic,"Alfred Hitchcock was the master of making films full of suspense and horror. Hitchcock is able to get into the mind of his viewers and leave them shocked and horrified that anyone could do what Norman Bates did. The title describes exactly what Norman Bates is. A psycho. Even though this movie is old school and filming has changed and improved a lot since this movie came out, I still believe today's generation can still sit and enjoy this movie. In this psychological thriller, viewers are left screaming at their T.V. screen trying to tell the characters to get out while they can. This popular 1960 horror film was so successful, there was a current television series created that is just as successful as the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Holds up,"An essential film. For a movie whose greatness hinges on its pulsating perfect score, even Hitchcock thought so, it's still a full accomplishment with considerably great performances (specifically Perkins and Leigh), groundbreaking themes and images, iconic editing, and a compelling story. In addition, being a true gateway film for Hollywood to again reinvent itself and allow more risqué films from major studios and major directors. No one worked within but also pushed the bounds of censorship laws and regulations, that plagued many huge productions of the time, like Hitchcock did. Defining violence of the 60's before it would inevitably reinvent itself in movies such as Texas Chain Saw Massacre and Halloween, Psycho truly defined what the story outline of a modern slasher could choose to go with, and most likely make a serviceable picture. Even my mother, who hates horror movies, was bummed she couldn't see it and says she would still like to sometime... that's the power of Hitchcock, effectively making movies serviceable to everyone, but dense enough that those who want a challenge will get one (for his more complex movies), and that's the true definition of a master. Hitchcock is one of my favorite directors and normally I wouldn't speak so highly and definitively about something, I figured it was worth it for a man who made back to back to back critical outlines for their respective genres.If even possible anymore, go into this not knowing the plot.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Very Different From The Rest Of The Hitch Collection,"There is no debating that ""Psycho"" is one of the classic psychological thriller movies of all-time. Some might say that it even invented the genre. What is perhaps even more interesting, however, is how different this film is from the rest of Alfred Hitchcock's directorial efforts--and different for the better.For a very basic overview, ""Psycho"" sees young secretary Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) steal a large sum of money from her employer in hopes of starting a new life with boyfriend Sam Loomis (John Gavin). While escaping the city in the dead of night (and the pouring rain), Crane pulls into the Bates Motel, owned and run by one Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). What Marion, as well as a private investigator (Martin Balsam) and Lila Crane (Vera Miles) later on, discovers is that Norman is hiding a deep and terrible secret revolving around his beloved ""mother"".In most other Hitchcock movies, the plot revolves around some sort of MacGuffin, or object that pushes the plot along. In short, less plot-heavy and much more a showcase of the stars, styles, and tropes of the time they were made. ""Psycho"" initially looks to be much of the same, what with the money that Marion steals pushing the action in the early goings. But then she makes that fateful turn into the parking lot of the Bates Motel and everything changes. From that point, the film swiftly pivots into a master class on the building of mystery, tension, and intriguing characters. In other words, it becomes a true psychological thriller that holds up 60+ years after its theater debut.Front and center in this genre transformation is Perkins' performance as Norman Bates, easily one of creepiest (and thus most iconic) acting jobs in cinema history. The way he turns on a dime from jocular goofball to menacing madman is truly a sight to behold. Norman's characterization has to be absolutely perfect to sell the big twist at the end, and Perkins nails every scene.In a historic sense, ""Psycho"" is also a landmark film for some of the material portrayed on-screen (at least at that time). From the small stuff (the first time a toilet was ever shown flushing on the big screen, believe it or not) to the infamous shower scene and cross-dressing, Hitchcock was far ahead of his time with this one. During an era when the cinema was still considered family-entertainment diversion, for the most part, he provided perhaps the first true chilling experience sitting in a theater seat.Even more impressive about ""Psycho""? Sometimes, when any film achieves such a high degree of popularity, it loses a bit of its edge because every scene, character, and line gets dissected a thousand times over. In this case, though, ""Psycho"" can be watched at fairly regular intervals without getting too stale. Hitch's masterful directing probably has a lot to do with this. Even if you know what is coming (and most people by now do), it is still creepy and compelling.In short, ""Psycho"" is a seminal film of American cinema for its character studies and raw thematic material when its contemporaries, generally speaking, were much lighter and sometimes little more than vehicles for their stars. Whether the first time or the twenty-first time watching this gem, you will pick out ""just one more thing"" that amazes you, as well as experience that ""creepy-crawly"" feeling regarding the goings-on at the Bates Motel.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
My second favourite film,"What can I praise about this phenomenal film that hasn't been said before over the last 62 years? It is so beautifully crafted. Everything about this film, all elements are a 10/10 in my opinion. I'm gonna start with the acting; Anthony Perkins does such an amazing job at portraying Norman bates. All the small nonverbal nuances of his performance such as the clenching of his jaw or his aversion of his eyes all come together to bring out this very socially inept and nervous character who you can't help sympathise with but at the same time get a sense of despair and darkness. Not to mention his delivery of his lines during tense scenes which make you question his character and keeps adding to the suspense Hitchcock so brilliantly creates.Perkins' actual appearance is also works incredibly well for the character as he looks to be a harmless and slender motel owner but that couldn't be further from the truth. Janet Leigh plays the role of Marion Crane who ends up in trouble with the law and is on the run to escape the 'private trap' she's put herself in. Her performance is equally as good as Perkins and they both contrast greatly to eachother which once again ads to the suspense that underpins the the film. She has such a soft and articulate way of speaking, making her appear to be very intellectual which makes her slow downfall that much more devastating and shocking. The score for this film from the opening credits which runs all throughout the run time every now and then at key scenes is just so perfectly used and I genuinely feel tense hearing it on its own so when it is combined with a thrilling scene it just exponentially increases the feelings going through my head. Now don't get me started on the cinematography for this film as I could go on for ages about how visually stunning and actually groundbreaking some of the shots are. One interesting fact I like is that Psycho was the first film to show a toilet flushing and it was regarded as being vulgar at the time. Obviously there's the iconic shower scene which is famous for a reason. I believe the budgetry constraints Hitchcock had actually improved the scene for me. The blood as chocolate sauce and the sound effects of a knive stabbing a melon which works very well and definitely holds up even today as the cutaways from the action make it that more intense and disturbing as you are forced to imagine more of what is happening. The overall plot is thought provoking and keeps you hooked into the story right from the first shot in Phoenix to the very end. Hitchcock's use of cause and effect logic is the main reason this film's events connect and play out so well together. The fact that Sam mentions to Marion about needing money means that we know as an audience they have money troubles and only a few minutes later a rich man buying a house places 40k dollars right in front of Marion almost taunting her financial situation.To conclude you are certainly going to do yourself a disservice not watching this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Rightfully considered one of the all time horror masterpieces.,"(Halloween Horror Reviews #1)To Begin my rush of October horror reviews, I will now cover one of the most iconic and acclaimed horror films ever. Alfred Hitchcock's often imitated, but never matched, Psycho.To start, the film has possibly one of the tightest screenplays ever written. Innumerable twists, plays on the audiences expectations and elegant little subversions upon itself make the plot come alive and dazzle like a firecracker. I mean it when I say that 54 years after its release the rest of the genre is still trying to catch-up Joseph Stefano and Robert Bloch's masterpiece of a screenplay. However, the way Hitchcock delivers this script is also incredible. Small visual hints and tricks make the film a joy to re-watch. For example, we see a woman in white underwear, later in the film she wears black underwear to show that she has committed an impure act. Such tiny details, but the impact is massive on the whole.Next the acting. Anthony Perkins delivers one of the most effective 'creepy' performances of all time. Like the screenplay it too has not been matched in 54 years and remains the yardstick for all psychopathic portrayals in film. Aside from Perkins however, the rest of the cast give strong performances, particularly Janet Leigh in the 'starring' role.The set design is legendary. Such mundane and simple locations are brought to life by the films exquisite lighting and use of shadows. The house in the background to the main set looms like a falcon, and casts a shadow over all the preceding events. You feel like someone is watching you at all times, and are constantly on edge. Such simple images as a stuffed bird, or a tall staircase are used so effectively here. This film remains an icon on minimalist set design, and how to creep your audience out with the simplest of imagery.Overall I cannot praise this film enough. One of the most iconic and brilliant films, from one of the most iconic and brilliant directors of all time.Happy Halloween.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of my favourite ever films,"Psycho is one of the most stylish and creative films of all time, easily in my top 5 films ever. Anyone who gives this below an 8 needs to revaluate their decision.Psycho is masterfully directed by Alfred Hitchcock and beautifully acted. Every character is brilliant, Anthony Perkins is sublime as Norman Bates and Janet Leigh is perfect as Marion Crane, it was refreshing to see a woman as the main character. But Norman Bates has to take the spot for best character, perhaps in any horror film ever.The plot is simple to follow, or it seems like it. Being shot in black and white allows for the picture quality to be very high and whilst you're watching the shower scene notice how much eerier it is to see just this shadow figure of a woman silhouetted and slowly advancing from the background, the appreciated low shot angles also heightens the manipulative techniques Hitchcock uses. Additionally all of the film's action is plot driven, there's not one scene that doesn't contribute in some way to the overall film.10/10: Probably the greatest thriller ever",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

OG horror,Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho is a god tier horror movie and I'd say its probably the best example of classic horror. The story has at this point been told and remixed 1000 different ways over the years but because of Alfred's understanding of human fear and his incredible skill as a director no other film maker can come close to creating as captivating of a psychopath as the infamous Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). I love the symbolism in the very last scene where Norman sits alone in the chair and claims he'd never hurt a fly. Very clever and unorthodox camera angles keep the viewer on the edge of their seat while watching this film especially during the scenes where Norman attacks his victims and the famous shrieking sound effect begins to play. If you have never seen this movie and enjoy horror movies it is definitely worth watching. Even though compared to current film it may seem dated because of the lack of special effects and computer animation the rawness and great use of music and sound effects by Hitchcock make this slasher flick stand the test of time.,8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Possibly the best film ever made! No Spoilers.,"I remember the first time watching this film (as I write this I am listening to Bernard Herrmanns wonderful score for the film), best Saturday night movie ever! Lights all turned off to add to the suspense. Its one of those films you can only really see once, but I have watched it more than 10 times! I think that the music for this film is amazing, from the opening credits to the infamous ""Shower Scene"". Obviously I would say it was Hitchcock's best (as a lot of people would agree) and the casting choice is brilliant, unlike the 1998 'disasterpiece' with Vince Vaugh as Norman Bates(seriously?!). Anthony Perkins has got to be one of the greatest movie villains ever! I cannot recommend this film enough!

A cleverly made psychological thriller film which can take audience wherever Hitchcock wants.,"First of all I was disappointed to see the movie in B&W. But, after watching the movie I can clearly understand why Hitchcock had chosen B&W over colour. If you are also thinking like me, don't care about the colour just watch this.If you don't, you are just giving up on the ""mother"" of all modern horror movies. No movie lover will take a risk of not watching Psycho. The cinema begins normally, in Phoenix, Arizona. The lead actress was a worker in a real-estate service corporation. She stole $40,000, which she had to put in bank and decides to leave the city. When she was driving, there must be scenes at her office and home to be shown. All we expect was to see those but not the face of the actress, but Hitchcock made a remarkable history to just show what is really needed. This makes you realize the mastery of Hitchcock. A psychological thriller which people didn't see till 1960, remains unaltered in its image.This connects to our minds directly. Norman Bates(Anthony Perkins), the owner of Bates Motel and a Momma's boy looks like a friendly person. His action really brought the movie to life. An great movie which makes us predict what happens next, but deceives us every time in a HONEST way. Coming to the part which contributed majorly to the movie's success, MUSIC. Bernard Herrmann's score is quintessential. The music he gave makes the movie appealing at the most famous scene ""Shower Scene"". The most frightening scene is the out-of-nowhere murder of the Private Investigator. The music helped a lot here too. By continuously shocking the audience, Hitchcock took the movie in his direction, righteously. At the end, the audience will be shocked again and this is most horrifying too.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Psycho,"Alfred Hitchcock directed probably his best-known work in 1960 with his feature based on the book of the same name by Robert Bloch. Starring Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh, and Hitchcock's abandoned would-be star Vera Miles; Psycho explores a desperate woman's attempt to forge a life with her boyfriend, and a man driven by his relationship to his mother. Psycho is a wonderful case study into the psyche of human beings with vastly different outlooks and intentions for their lives. Hitchcock delved into the psychology of humanity in a way to make audiences pay attention all the while creating a complete masterpiece and the film most closely associated with the famed suspense director.On a December day in Arizona, the audience meets Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) who has just spent an extended lunch hour with her boyfriend Sam Loomis (John Gavin). Sam is divorced and lives far from Marion so the only time they have together is stolen lunch hours and hotel rooms. Sam is reluctant to further his relationship with Marion, despite the intense love shared between the two, because he pays a monthly alimony to his divorcée wife. Marion has a deep conversation with Sam in regards to the future of their relationship, as she wishes to become a married woman and create a home for Sam. Leaving the hotel room feeling helpless, a little desperate, and enslaved by her love of Sam so much so that she knows herself to be unable to leave him. Upon returning to her office, Marion's boss brings in a client flashing around $40,000 in cash for a transaction. Marion, being the one trusted to take the large sum of cash to the bank, instantly devises a plot in which she and Sam can enjoy a life together, married, together, and happy, if she can get away with the $40,000. Instead of going to the bank, Marion scurries home to pack a bag and embark on a new life. After speeding away on her new mission, Marion's boss passes her on the street initiating a guilt trip that Marion can't escape. After taking a nap on the side of the road, Marion has an interaction with a police officer which puts her even more on edge. Marion, convinced she must trade in her car for a new one after seeing her boss on the street, hastily makes a deal with the dealership o\owner and speeds away hoping to avoid suspicion. After an especially rainy night, Marion has become unsure of her location and pulls into a secluded motel. Emerging from her car for shelter for the night, Marion meets motel owner Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), a seemingly nice young man who helps Marion inside with her bags and offers to make her dinner so she doesn't have to go back out into the rain. After hearing a heated exchange between Norman and his mother, Marion offers advice and consolation for Norman, believing his mother to be an overbearing negative presence on his life. Norman is clearly taken aback by what he perceives to be an attack against his mother, Marion is taken aback by his strong reaction and seeks refuge to her room as she has already begun questioning her plan and seems to have decided to go back to Tuscon, return the money, and make amends with her boss. Little does Marion know, Norman and his relationship to his mother would interfere with her plans.Psycho has reached the point that there is little left to say about this film. It's a near perfect entry on Hitchcock's filmography. Psycho is so closely associated with the famed director that it has been endlessly analyzed and heralded for the masterwork that it is. The standout from the film, other than the brilliant direction of a largely dialogue-driven plot, is the fantastic score. Bernard Herrmann, a frequent collaborator with Hitchcock, crafts a perfect horror/suspense score that is as iconically connected to the film as the John Williams score is to Jaws. Granted, I haven't seen much of Anthony Perkins' work, but he was perfectly cast in the role of Norman Bates. Norman had to embody a psychotic crazed maniac inside a quiet, unassuming petulant child all at once, and Perkins was perfect for the extreme marriage of characterization. Martin Balsam is a brilliant character actor and it's always fun to see him pop up in a film. As earlier stated, Psycho is a surprisingly dialogue- driven film, with only a few shots of action sparsed throughout the film. The pivotal scene in which Marion and Norman share dinner together, bringing Marion back to her good- natured self, was filmed in such a perfect way highlighting the taxidermied shells on the wall exposing the possibility that Norman could be a much more sinister character than he initially appears. Hitchcock proves his strength as a suspense director with his seminal classic, Psycho. Near-perfect direction, incredible casting, and a brilliant score, it is clear to see why Psycho has stood the test of time, and remains a favorite and yearly Halloween viewing tradition, for myself anyway.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Wish I could've seen this in '60,"I hate that I knew about the shower scene before I ever saw the movie. I hate that I went in thinking it's a movie about Anthony Perkins/Norman Bates instead of Janet Leigh/Marion Crane. But even knowing what I did when I first saw it didn't take away too much from this masterpiece.Norman Bates, ever the victim, cleaning up after his mother's misdeeds. What great acting by Perkins. His delivery of such lines as ""We all go a little mad sometimes... Haven't you?"" with the chuckle in the middle. The look on his face when that car wasn't going to sink all the way. The way Arbogast had him flustered and his mother almost came out, ""I'm not a fool and I'm not capable of being fooled... Maybe she fooled me but she didn't fool my mother!"" What a great line that was anyway.Someone suggested that Vince Vaughan did a better job in the '98 version of Psycho. Oh no. No no no no no. In the original you really believe Norman Bates is an innocent victim. You're really kind of hoping he'll pull it off. No way he could've killed the girl. Vince Vaughan himself looks like a murderer.This movie gets a big fat 10 from me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
On Edge from Bates Motel to the End,"Hitchcock did a wonderful job with this. I was pretty much on the edge of my seat from the time Norman Bates was introduced at the Bates Motel. The movie did a wonderful job illustrating that something was off with the main character but didn't make it too obvious. The buildup at the beginning was well done and gave a great backstory about Marion. I thought the theme music was very good for its time. I'm not the biggest fan of the acting throughout the movie, especially some of the death scenes. It's Hitchcock's style and I get what he's trying to portray but it just doesn't age well compared to modern movies and effects. It doesn't ruin the movie but any means since I still believe this one is close to an all-time classic for me, but it does knock it down a bit. 4.5/5 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Masterstroke - Psycho is simply brilliant,"What can I say about Hitchcock that hasn't already been said so many times before? The man was an absolute genius and I adore his work. And just to get it all out of the way I love Psycho, just in case that wasn't already clear.In the late '50's and early '60's there was a flurry of low budget, mostly B&W horror/thriller/suspense movies made. Think the work of Wiliam Castle(The Tingler, House on Haunted Hill, Macabre)as an example. These proved mostly very popular with audiences, and it was this trend that sparked Hitchcock to try his hand at the same formula. The result was Psycho.(as a side note William Castle in turn made ""Strait-Jacket"" as a direct response to Psycho) The true strength of Psycho, for me, lies not in the Famous Shower scene or the brief outbursts of violence(few as they are) heightened by Bernard Herrmann's now signature score. The true strength of this film lies in the casting of Antony Perkins and Janet Leigh. They portray their respective characters perfectly. Watching the subtle nuances in their performances, the minor changes in expression, the inflections and tone of voice is just fascinating. There simply is no Norman Bates without Anthony Perkins.Even to the very last scene Psycho keeps you enthralled where the big pay-off of the story is not stereotypically the apprehension of a maniac(or psychopath if you will)or the solving of a crime with the comforting knowledge that all is well again. Instead it comes with the realisation of just how far down the rabbit hole you've truly gone, and that ""Norman Bates"" can be anyone or anywhere. Be it the unassuming shy owner of a roadside motel or even your neighbour.Psycho is simply a must see picture.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A Terrific Film!,"'Psycho' is a Terrific Film, in all respects. It's chilling, it's captivating & it's memorable. Directed by Maverick Filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock, this 1960 classic, is indeed time-less!'Psycho' depicts the encounter between a secretary, Marion Crane, played by Janet Leigh, hiding at a secluded motel after embezzling money from her employer, and the motel's disturbed owner and manager, Norman Bates, played shockingly by Anthony Perkins, and the aftermath of their encounter.Adapted from the 1959 novel of the same name by Robert Bloch, 'Psycho' begins with a bang, and ends with some haunted images. Norman Bates is a person, who is described as disturbed & neglected. In my opinion, Norman Bates is a person, who became the animal he was, because he lost his innocence too soon. He wanted to live, but when he thought he couldn't survive anymore, he took up violence to breath. It's a twisted personality, that shocks you & leaves you numb!Joseph Stefano's Adpated Screenplay is nearly flawless. There is hardly a moment when the film loses it's momentum. Alfred Hitchcock's Direction is spell-binding. The master storyteller directs this psychological thriller, most convincingly. John L. Russell's Cinematography is chilling. Each Frame looks haunted. The Lens-Man has done a masterful job. Editing by George Tomasini, is superb! Art-Direction, is scary!Performance-Wise: Anthony Perkins plays Norman Bates, shockingly. What Perkins achieves by playing Norman Bates, is nothing short of an embodiment. Perkins performs as if Norman Bates, was actually waiting for him to play him on celluloid. It's a Hall-Mark Performance, that is above any praise! Janet Leigh is fantastic. Vera Miles, John Gavin & Martin Balsam leave a mark, as well.On the whole, 'Psycho' is much more than it's infamous shower scene. It's a film that leaves you haunted, with it's sheer power!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The characters and story are amazing! I wasn't bored once during this film, and the twist! It was so odd but brilliantly genius, for it's time, even now. The shower scene wasn't as effective as it once was, but it was still great to see. I have to watch the sequel soon, I hope it's as good as this one.10/10

A classic if there ever was one.,"As much as I like the 1998 remake it was very unnecessary in my opinion. Why remake something that is already perfected? Psycho is probably the best horror movie this world will ever see. I think the fact that it's in black and white actually adds to the suspense of it all. Most of the movies from the 60's have faded with time and aren't spoken of much anymore but psycho even before the remake is still very remembered, very fresh in our heads, and still held in the very highest respects. (and thats not the only one of Hitchcock's movies that is.) I will always love the famous shower scene and always think about when I'm home alone in the shower and hear a noise. Not every movie has a scene in it that can live in your head like that. One of the ideas in this movie that i particularly like is how Marion was going to go back and fix what she had done wrong in the morning but it was too late. No one would have ever known after that that she was sorry and she was going to bring the money back it just brings up and interesting point.

Movie Review: HIST of American Cinema 272,"""Psycho"" is an outstanding film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, starring Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh, Vera Miles, and John Gavin. This Hitchcock classic doesn't disappoint, from the artistic camera angles to the great use of lighting, it gave the movie a unique texture that made it just more unsettling. Hitchcock did a terrific job directing the suspense throughout the movie which was aided by the strategic placement of the soundtrack. Another great aspect of this film was how good of a job each of the actors did. Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates, was painfully awkward and it made certain scenes so much more uncomfortable to watch. All in all, Psycho is a psychological thrill ride with a great plot twist.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Still One Of The Best Dark Thrillers, Even After 62 Years. Timeless. A Must Watch - 1-2-Own","Greetings And Salutations, and welcome to my review of Psycho; before launching into my critique, here's a breakdown of my ratings:Story - 1.75
Direction - 1.75
Pace - 1.75
Acting - 1.75
Enjoyment - 1.75TOTAL - 8.75 out of 10Sixty-Two years old and still kicking arse. The funny thing is, when Gus Van Sant gave us the frame-by-frame remake in 1998, the senior Norman slaughtered the junior Norman. Therefore, Psycho even whips its own ass.I loved the film so much when I originally watched it, that I hunted down the Robert Bloch novels. They are as worthy of a read as the movies are worth watching. Stefano does an admirable job of bringing the story to the screen. Some brilliant little touches work well to build the tension and show Marion's anxiety. These are exampled best in her car journey sequences. And it shows how good scenes can be when you have a good writer, an imaginative director, and a talented actress - A perfect synergy of skills - which also sums up the picture.As I mentioned above, Hitchock is visionary and a very clever one, at that. Not only does he add creative scenes, such as the opening sequence as we pan across the city and zoom into one window where we find Marion and Sam in a cheap hotel room. It's a little choppy because of the mechanics of the shot and the equipment available. Today he would have made it look as smooth as the proverbial baby's botbot. And the same can be said for Arboghast's staircase fall. The clever bits come in the form of conventional scenes. Too much of a good thing is still too much. Hitchcock is a maestro; he knows when a segment needs extra pazazz and when to leave it alone. It creates a visual and emotional rollercoaster ride for the audience, which stays stimulating and captivating.The cast is superb, and everyone gives their all. There are no small parts in Psycho, and I have to admit to liking all the characters, which is usually inconceivable in most films. Everyone is so perfectly fleshed out and realistic. There is only one Norman Bates, and that is Anthony Hopkins. For most of the movie, he comes across flawlessly as the shy and nervous motel manager. But in the last sequence, he sends a cold shiver straight down your spine and into your soul with a smile as insanely deadly and dangerous as The Joker's.If you have not watched Psycho, I strongly suggest finding a copy and giving it a look-see. This film, along with Rope and The Birds, is the best Hitchcock created.

Best Film by Hitchcock,"I was entirely impressed by this movie, since the beginning you feel something bad is gonna happen because of the music and the dialogues, but you won't understand until the end what is all about. You think the story goes on one direction but then you realized you were wrong talking about the characters and their motivations. You really feel you're watching a thriller, you feel as nervous as Marion all the time. The music was amazing, the scenes and the script. I would say it's a perfect movie. I wanna keep the story like that and won't watch the other Psycho movies. It is also interesting to know all what the movie involved during the production and after. For example the shower scene is one of the most memorable in horror films, the relationship between Norman and his mother is 'represented' in the Simpsons by Director Skyner and his mother, and, Antony Perkins couldn't get more success after his performance and he died in 1992, he got VIH.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The best of the Hitchcock canon,"Probably the best of all of the Hitchcock films, mostly due to the surprise mid-film demise of the film's main character.  The basic problem with any suspense film is the audience can be secure in the knowledge that the big-name star will survive the film--somehow. Psycho breaks this tradition and throws the audience a completely unexpected curve. Psycho also demonstrates what a good director can do with a low budget and, basically, a one-set picture.  Good performances all around, particularly from Perkins. Nearly a perfect piece of cinema, marred only by occasionally sloppy editing and a few unfair red herrings, such as using an actress (Virginia Gregg) as the voice of ""mother"" instead of having Perkins do it. Brilliant Bernard Herrmann score uses only strings. Title sequences by Saul Bass seamlessly set-up the story. Would-be horror film directors need to thoroughly understand what makes this film a masterpiece before they shoot their first frame of film.

MASTERPIECE,"A lengthy career directing movies prepared Hitchcock for this technical triumph of film craftsmanship. The perfect storyboarding and editing make it a model for professionals and students alike. The casting and acting are equally great, as is the Oscar nominated cinematography of John L. Russell, the editing of George Tomasini and the music of Bernard Hermann, with the titles by Saul Bass setting the mood. All four of these men worked frequently with ""Hitch"" in movies or on his TV show.

The best film of all time!,"When Alfred Hitchcock started to direct this film in 1959, he could have had no idea that a film starring Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh could bypass the brilliance of his films starring James Stewart (Vertigo, The Man Who Knew too Much and Rear Window). But how wrong he was...""Psycho"" went on to become the highest grossing black and white film of all time, (In a time when colour films were already popular) the highest grossing horror film of all time and the highest grossing Alfred Hitchcock film of all time. The film made Anthony Perkins a superstar, but sadly, this was more harming to his career than uplifting, as the movie-going public always have (and always will) only seen him as Norman Bates, and nobody else. This was concurred as Perkins never again made a film of real value, but in 1983 ""Psycho 2"" was a huge hit for Universal Pictures. Janet Leigh on the other hand, went on to make a few well done done films in her respect.About the film: Anthony Perkins' performance as the stuttering Norman Bates is in my opinion the greatest film performance of all time. His nervous, boyish acting style brings a simple charm to the character, and he even succeeds in creating a sympathetic approach from the public. He even succeeds in hiding his character's madness, and couldn't do it better. Janet Leigh is perfect as the thief, and you even have more sympathy for Norman as for Marion. The rest of the cast, (John Gavin - Sam Loomis; Vera Miles - Lila Crane; Martin Balsam - Milton Arbogast and John McIntire's Sheriff Chambers) are all as good as it gets, but no one matches Anthony Perkins performance. Sorry to say, but John Gavin is miscast. He looks too gentle, too moral to ever cheat on his wife. This is the only bad thing about this cinema classic.The classic shower scene not only created a single shock, but a film memory to haunt for generations to come. Alfred Hitchcock filmed this scene with great care and delicacy. You can sense this with the fact that not a finger is out of place, and even Janet Leigh still showers in fear.I was disgusted when I learned that Perkins wasn't even nominated for an Academy Award, because he should have won it! He wasn't nominated for ANY prize of ANY kind, and to crown it all, Janet Leigh was nominated for an Oscar and won a Golden Globe. Well deserved, I should think, but Perkins was the real reason that the film reached such success, not Leigh, nor Hitchcock.I salute both Anthony Perkins and sir Alfred Hitchcock for what they've done for film history, and for the fact that there will be only one Tony Perkins, and one Alfred Hitchcock.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"""We all go a little mad sometimes""","""Psycho"" has been rightly regarded as a major work of cinematic art by film critics and scholars alike, who praise it for its wonderful direction, tense and edgy atmosphere, marvelous camerawork, haunting score and masterful performances. It completely revolutionized cinema and would change the horror genre forever. It would be one of the earliest films to set a new level of acceptability for deviant behavior, violence and sexuality in American films, and you could say that it is one of the earliest examples of the slasher genre. It was unprecedented in its depiction of violence and sexuality for it time, partly due to the erosion of the Hays Code. Famously, Walt Disney would refuse to allow Alfred Hitchcock to later film at Disneyland because Hitchcock had made ""that disgusting movie, 'Psycho.'Anthony Perkin's fine performance, an iconic script, and Bernard Herrmann's classic score make ""Psycho"", a film that will always be remembered as the pinnacle of the horror genre. ""The Shower Scene"", in which the murder of Janet Leigh's character takes place, in the shower is one of the best-known, and most pivotal, in all of cinema. The sound that the knife makes killing Marion Crane is the sound of a knife stabbing a melon. Alfred Hitchcock originally intended not to have any music for the sequence, but Herrmann insisted that he try his composition, and Hitchcock agreed that it escalated the scene, and would double Herrmann's salary in the process.Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh would later say that they did not mind being stereotyped because of their roles in their film, as they ""would rather be stereotyped and be remembered forever for this classic movie than not be remembered at all.""

"""He wouldn't even harm a fly...""","Often referred to as the most famous and influential horror film of all time, Psycho broke down all barriers of comfort and escape when going to the pictures. With people fainting and screaming uncontrollably in their seats at the time of release, the film is still as unsettling and nerve-wrecking as it was 50 years ago, and has cemented Alfred Hitchcock as the true master of suspense.Adapted from the significantly less successful novel from Robert Bloch, Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is a young attractive woman who has stolen $40,000 from the bank where she works, in order to runaway with her already-married lover. After driving all night in pouring rain, she stops at the Bates motel off the freeway for a night-in, and meets the nervous, bumbling Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) who is quite taken with her upon first sight. In one of the most staggering sequences in film history, she is stabbed to death while taking a shower, and as she is reported missing and people begin looking for her, the truth of Norman Bates and his 'motel' will be revealed.Never before had the main character been brutally murdered only halfway through - let alone an attractive leading lady - and never before had such a brutal antagonist been so normal, relatable and above all, human. Beautifully shot in black and white and carried by an unforgettable score from the late Bernard Herrmann, Hitchcock in all his genius draws us in with a twisted concoction of sex, murder and madness, never letting us forget even to this day that real horror may be right around the corner. All the performances are top-notch, particularly that of Perkins who as cinema's most unlikely serial killer stumbles through the film with every breath of confidence stripped from him by his overbearing invalid mother.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"At the Bates Motel, you can take a shower...AT YOUR OWN RISK!","One can pinpoint with reasonable certainty where the modern horror movie really began.  It began in 1960 with the release of Alfred Hitchcock's all-time masterpiece PSYCHO.The story of Marion Crane stopping off at the Bates Motel and taking the shower which would live in cinematic history and infamy is so well known that no regurgitation of the plot is necessary.  But what is important to know about PSYCHO is the fact that it introduced a number of important elements to the genre that had never been used before.  It introduced us to the ""slasher"", in the form of Anthony Perkins' off-balance Norman Bates and his ""Mother.""  It bought the horror film firmly into contemporary times by being set in the present.  It also took a very unique approach to psychology and murder in a way that no film had done before, and few films have done since.What is the most significant about PSYCHO's celebrated shower murder, besides the literal knife-edge editing and Bernard Herrmann's classic shrieking strings, is the way Hitchcock depicts this scene.  So many slasher films entirely miss the point of that scene, focusing only on the (limited) blood.  But Hitchcock manipulates the film in such a way as to make this scene LOOK much more graphic than it really is.  It is a brilliant feat of movie-making on the part of the cinema's ultimate Master Of Suspense.Even the much-criticized final scene involving the psychiatrist (Simon Oakland) isn't very bothersome; he brings up the first real honest-to-goodness explanation of a disturbed killer.  As he relates Norman's story, he tells the group there in the room, ""He was never all Norman.  But he was often ONLY Mother.""Scripted by Joseph Stefano from Robert Bloch's novel of the same name, and loosely based on the case of Wisconsin mass murderer Ed Geinn (which also inspired the 1974 cult masterpiece THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE), PSYCHO remains a masterpiece to this very day, even after more than four decades of sequels, imitators, imitators of imitators, and an atrocious remake.

The plot is chilling, creepy, dark, horrific and has a one of a kind fantastic twist ending. The film has many creepy scenes and the shower scene is still spine tingling and timeless.

Psycho Superb!,"This is a splendid movie that shows Alfred Hitchcock at the top of his form. This movie came right after North by Northwest, also by Hitchcock, so it has to be one of the best one-two punches by a director in film history. The first half of the movie, dominated by the character of Marion Crane, is to me, the superior part, without any disrespect to the rest of the film. Janet Leigh's controlled performance is so convincing we feel every nerve-wracking moment after that first excruciating misdeed. From the opening scene over the skyline of Phoenix into the hotel room of Marion and Sam, I was drawn into the movie in a way that only a great movie can achieve. Audiences often complain that a movie can seldom measure up to a good book; however, a great movie can do visual tricks and show nuances very effectively in the hands of a great director. This movie is a case in point. The camera zooms into an envelope holding $40,000 or a peephole where Anthony Perkins, as Norman Bates, observes Marion undressing. The music is like chalk on a blackboard as the sharp violin strings heighten the nauseating fear that we feel along with Marion. The closeup of the police officer in sunglasses is almost terrifying. The pounding of the rain on the windshield is something almost everyone can feel and in this case, it seems like the world is crowding in on Marion. Scene by scene we go from one vignette to another. Vera Miles, as Marion's sister, and John Gavin, as Marion's lover, give brilliant performances as they try to get to the truth of Marion's disappearance. The supporting cast is outstanding, particularly Martin Balsam as Abrogast, the private eye. Anthony Perkins gives his career defining role, although he had many great roles. This was the only Hitchcock role for Leigh and Petkins and they made these characters their own. Highly recommend because it shows the great potential of film/making.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Psycho,"Psycho is the iconic horror movie that created the slasher genre. This seminal film has influenced everything from Halloween to Scream. It has a great script, great direction by Hitchcock, an iconic score by Bernard Herrmann, and a chilling turn by Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates. The only weak link is the exposition dump delivered by the psychiatrist in the last ten minutes of the film I found it totally superfluous. Now I know the monologue was meant to explain Norman Bates's pathology but it comes across as way too expository. I guess audiences back in 1960, needed to have that monologue to understand Norman Bates' psychosis. In today's climate movie goers are far more sophisticated, so I guess that speech was acceptable back in 1960. Anyway I digress, Psycho is a great horror movie that every film fan should check out.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Psycho by Alfred Hitchcock is a must see,"Being often nicknamed, ""The Master of Suspense"", Alfred Hitchcock certainly does not disappoint in his black and white film, Psycho (1960), with his certain use of psychological examination of his characters that will have you intrigued from the very beginning of his film. Psycho is a classic horror film that challenges the genre for a contemporary audience, a rush of chaotic fear and madness as suspenseful as you would have predicted from the movie that started the slasher genre itself.Despite a slower pace and dated special effects, it's a well crafted if unconventional horror film. Along with it's creativity, it has a more engaging plot filled with more visual disturbing than almost any other film in the horror genre.Hitchcock does this by building a connection to his audience to the characters. By getting into the main character, Marion Crane's (Janet Leigh) mind at an early start of the film, has you not only engaged but intensively worried already of what will happen to her. Being a secretary in Phoenix, Marion's conscience drives her insane when she decides to steal 40,000 dollars from a client in order to run away with her love, Sam Loomis (John Gavin). With an eerie feel, you are sucked into the movie trying to figure out how and why things are happening to her. The buildup adds to the intensity of the unknown of who is the killer and why their motives are the way that they are.As Marion Crane tries to run farther away from her problems, not only has she found herself in a huge rainstorm but also exhausted from the endless thoughts of her conscience mind. Having to pull over she is luckily able to find the flickering lights of the Bates Motel to stay the night. There she meets the polite, man of few words, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). Norman welcomes Marion to her stay by casual talk over sandwiches and milk. Norman then explains his interest in taxidermy and his unique relationship with his mother. Hitchcock sets the scene of this encounter by his ability of using foreshadowing with little details of Norman's parlor where the scene takes place. It is there where we find out more about his overbearing, domineering mother. Throughout the entire film, viewers have a sense of suspense always being displayed whether it is through the mysterious music, the director's use of certain angles, or even just the unknown of what we as the audience understand. Hitchcock finds a way of having you always questioning and in a way, overwhelmed with emotions while watching his films. Viewers that are from my generation could say that to be even considered a ""horror"" film or even a ""thriller"" there must be a certain amount of violence or gore to reach this criteria.However, in 1960, horrified viewers saw Psycho as such a thrilling film and to be surprisingly not explicitly violent which our generation today would be uncommonly found in the latest horror, thriller films. Hitchcock doesn't use the violent gestures to make his film what it is. It is about the psychological intellect that he so deliberately has the audience feel. It is about the buildup and the mysterious overall mood of his masterpiece that has you leaving wanting more.If the definition of a good thriller to you is gore and violence, Psycho wouldn't necessarily be the movie for you. Not meaning to say that there isn't a scene or two that will take you by surprise, but there is so much more than the gruesome feel to this movie. It is Hitchcock's way of giving his audience enough suspense, curiosity, and most of all, that thrilling feel that makes the must see Psycho what it is, a worldwide phenomenon.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Hitchcok's best!,"Definitely Hitchocoks best, or the best Hitchcock film I've seen. the camera work and that superb score by Bernard Hermann makes this one of the greatest films ever made.Anthony Perkins is undoubtedly one of the best villains in a movie that I've seen. So scary and unpredictable. The fact that Janet Leigh only made an appearance up to 40 mins or so into the film makes her appearance memorable and Norman Bates.Contains one of the greatest scenes in cinematic history. That score by Herman mixed with th illusions Marion supposedly being stabbed then the shot of the blood pouring into the plug hole is just unlike something that i've ever seen. Unfortunately I've given this 4.5 stars rather than 5 because the ending and the whole "" psycho killer"" thing has been done so many times over the last decade or so the film felt very familiar to me.Overall definitely Hitchcock's best work and now I must watch some of Hitchcock's films done in the 40's. Definitely a film everyone must watch. Highly recommended!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of best psychological horrors ever seen,"You just can't forget that damn final part.The whole movie is un interrogation and I couldn't really tell you the solution until the very end came. It's beautiful that this kind of films are still in people's hands.The only thing that should have been better are the effects. I know Hitchcock wanted a film with a budget under a million dollars, but it really could have done better on that.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Hitchcock really went there,Just recently saw the slightly extended version that was in theaters in the 60's and wow... it's definitely still tame when you compare it to horror films from today but you can easily see how this was pushing the boundaries for films of that time.,10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
