Ben Stiller's Best Movie!,"This is hands down Ben Stiller's best movie. It has great action, great dialogue, great acting, great music and great humor. This movie is filled with quotable lines and works very well. The performances I have to single out for praise are Ben Stiller, Robert Downey Jr, Jay Baruchel, Matthew McConaughey, and Tom Cruise. I feel like this movie approaches it's themes in a way similar to Blazing Saddles but Blazing Saddles has a lot more slapstick. The Tugg Speedman character is not as memorable as Derek Zoolander but this movie is far better than Zoolander is. This is my favorite Ben Stiller movie alongside Meet The Fockers, Zoolander, Starsky and Hutch, and Night At The Museum 1 and 3 but I still haven't seen There's Something About Mary. I honestly prefer Robert Downey Jr as Kirk Lazuras over him as Iron Man but they are both fantastic performances. Tom Cruise is awesome as Less Grossman. He owns his character that is very different from everything else he has done. I hope Ben Stiller is proud of this movie because to me this is his best one.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"'Man, I don't drop character 'till I done the DVD commentary.'","Tropic Thunder is a 2008 parody film and is amongst the funniest films of the 2000s without a doubt.The humour doesn't shy away from what is deemed to be politically incorrect nowadays, but looking past all that it's a very funny film.The self awareness provided throughout is entertaining and the dialogues pack a punch. The all-star cast all embody their characters really well and do a great job at satirising the hollywood film industry.The story, like a lot of other comedies is not the film's strong point, and some of the film's scenes aren't overly funny but many are.So many great lines in here too.

This is the greatest story ever told.,"When asked, what's your favorite movie?

Comedic,"""Tropic Thunder"" (2008), directed by Ben Stiller, is a satirical comedy that brilliantly skewers the film industry, celebrity culture, and the absurdities of war movies. The film boasts an ensemble cast, including Stiller, Robert Downey Jr., and Jack Black, who deliver hilarious performances, elevating the movie to cult classic status.One of the standout features of ""Tropic Thunder"" is its meta-narrative. The film follows a group of self-absorbed actors who find themselves in a real-life jungle war zone while filming a war movie. Stiller's portrayal of the narcissistic action star Tugg Speedman, Downey Jr.'s method actor Kirk Lazarus, and Black's over-the-top comedian Jeff Portnoy create a trio of memorable characters, each a caricature of Hollywood archetypes.Downey Jr.'s performance is particularly noteworthy, as he plays a white actor who undergoes surgery to darken his skin for a role, adding a layer of satire that addresses issues of race and cultural appropriation in Hollywood. The film cleverly navigates these sensitive topics through its comedic lens, sparking both laughter and reflection.The screenplay, written by Stiller, Justin Theroux, and Etan Cohen, is filled with witty dialogue and clever humor. The film's self-awareness and willingness to lampoon Hollywood conventions contribute to its comedic success. The over-the-top action sequences and absurd situations parody the clichés often found in war films, creating a comedic commentary on the genre.""Tropic Thunder"" also benefits from its supporting cast, including Tom Cruise in an unrecognizable and hilarious role as the eccentric studio executive Les Grossman. Cruise's performance is a scene-stealer, adding an extra layer of comedic brilliance to the film.The cinematography captures the chaos of the jungle setting, and the use of practical effects in the action sequences adds to the film's authenticity while maintaining its comedic tone. The soundtrack, featuring classic rock hits, complements the humor and enhances the overall viewing experience.In conclusion, ""Tropic Thunder"" is a sharp and irreverent satire that lampoons Hollywood excesses and war movie conventions. With a stellar ensemble cast, clever writing, and a willingness to tackle controversial subjects, the film remains a standout comedy that continues to entertain audiences with its humor and social commentary.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Satire died after this,"How far we've come in 15 years. This movie barks at and pokes at and makes fun of every genre, class, society, movie, race, etc. It's fantastic and gets better every watch. Probably because these jokes wouldn't fly today.A comedy cloaked in a war movie cloaked in a war movie being made. Pure gold.Cast is amazing. You'll catch more jokes the more you watch it.Offensive? Sure. Don't come into this trying to be offended. If you're tough skinned, you'll still be offended. Comedy at its best should do this. It should poke holes. And make fun.

"11 years later, it still holds up to me","I saw this movie in theaters and fell in love with it. I've seen it many times throughout the years and have noticed most people either don't know or don't care for this film. After rewatching it yesterday, I just had to write about it.The casting was incredible in my opinion. People think of Ocean's Eleven or The Departed as movies with dream casts. I think Tropic Thunder holds its own. Tom Cruise and Matthew McConaughey are solid minor/supporting characters. I'm not a fan of Tom Cruise, but I find myself quoting all of his Les Grossman lines consistently. Nick Nolte, Steve Coogan, Bill Hader and Danny McBride are great additions. Jay Baruchel is his usual self, Brandon T Jackson was a solid part of the mix and the three main leads really deliver. Special mention to RDJ, by far my favorite performance. It's ridiculous how many layers there are to his character. At some point he's an Australian actor playing a Black guy playing an Asian farmer.Almost every single scene has a quotable line. The action is very well done and the story's so wonderfully over the top.I think the biggest win is how well it has aged in my opinion. Movies like The Hangover were really funny when they came out, but I find there's no replay value. The jokes don't work well the second time around. The same goes for something like Deadpool. On the other hand, films like Borat, Anchorman and Tropic Thunder still make me laugh regardless of how many times I've seen it.I wish Ben Stiller would go back to doing stuff like this. A Les Grossman sequel would've been absolutely incredible!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Sharp Satire,"'Tropic Thunder' is the sharpest, nastiest, and most honest parody of Hollywood since Altman's 'The Player'.If Doweny Jr. in black face, the script's use of ""retard"", or the politically incorrect humor offends you, you're missing the point.Only Russel Crowe, Robin Williams, and Harvey Weinstein should take offense. The parodies of their personalities, their films, and their business tactics are downright cruel. (But, so, so true, and so brilliant.) I must credit every actor -- particularly Downey Jr. and Cruise -- for their performances, and for making their characters more than stereotypes for cheap laughs.The more you know about Hollywood, the more you will appreciate the film. If not, just go and laugh at the genre. It takes balls to leave in a scene discussing how Blue-Ray conquered HD-DVD (and expect anyone to fine it funny). But it is funny.To utterly relish the insanity, brush up on 'Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse'.They got it so right. So, so, so right.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Fantastic Comedy!,"This is one of those movies that you will be quoting for the rest of your life with your friends! Tropic Thunder is a great satire that I was honestly expecting to be terrible.The story was actually perfect to make fun of action movies and Hollywood. The situational comedy was genius as these actors were forced to actually survive a war like setting. The action scenes themselves resembled really action movies and were nicely done. They added the action in with the hilarity, and all of it worked perfectly.There were two characters that really stand out. Robert Downey Jr and Tom Cruise were both comedic gold! You won't recognize either of them, but they fit the roles fantastically. Some people find Downey's character to be inappropriate, but please take it for what it is supposed to be. Downey Jr was making fun of method acting and taking that concept to a completely new level with this role. I didn't realize Tom Cruise was in this until the credits. He is in a role that I never thought I would see him in. He is outrageous and over the top. His scenes are some of the most memorable from the movie.I don't want to give too much away since I don't want to spoil any of the comedic gold. Just know that you will be kept laughing the entire time, and the movie will just keep getting better. This is a great watch and definitely worth your time; 8/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

One of the better Action-Comedies,"Since god knows how many years it has been rotting in one of the corners of my watchlist; today was the day (finally) for me to put it out of that cursed, miserable place (yes watchlists can be a vicious place, trust me) and now I am thinking to myself why I didn't do it any earlier?Now coming back to the film...It is hilarious, it's one of those rare comedies that make you laugh out loud, make you crack up like a youngster. The Action on the other hand provides more than was expected of it. Some of the action pieces were stupendously done, could not have possibly asked for more.Yeah, the middle segment did hold back the movie quite a bit, the charm was misplaced for a limited amount of time but it gets back on its feet not long after!Moving on to the Performances...To be honest, everybody was incredible, they all played their parts with utmost sincerity and dedication. Two of them, however, were the uncontested standouts, and I know you have already guessed the names, yes one of them is a barely recognizable Tom Cruise as one of if not the most ridiculous characters he had ever portrayed and the other one is RDJ as Kirk Lazarus.He was the one who made my stomach hurt on so many occasions.

Funny spoof of every war film ever made,"Saw this at the Washington, DC screening on the 10th.And Got Some I did. A comedy that is not Apatow's is refreshing nowadays. A relentless hard R comedy that fuses elements of practically every famous war film ever made. Beginning with trailers a la Grindhouse for every major character was already a sign of a hilarious film. While most of the humor was ""funny-but-i'm-not-laughing"" the same amount of laugh out loud humor and gags was provided as well, courtesy of mostly Stiller and Downey Jr. Who I wholeheartedly feel - stole the show. I can't say I've ever seen any character like his in a film of this genre, which already I feel will enter the classics. What's refreshing about Thunder is that it's actually original in certain aspects of the storyline; such as when they decide to shoot the film guerilla style in the jungle only to have the director of the film....- I'll leave this at that. A spoof of war films that isn't tireless or idiotic like the recent Epic/Date films... which do not even deserve to be called ""spoofs"".

This is the kind of Ben Stiller we need more of,"Back when ""Tropic Thunder"" came out, it was part of the press that Robert Downey Jr. was playing a black man - that, is, playing an uber-serious actor submerging himself in the role of a black character (complete with skin pigmentation surgery). And that brand of multiple abstractions kicks up my admiration for that guy. What wasn't part of that press was who was playing Les Grossman, the sociopathic studio boss who hijacks the movie with his foul-mouthed douchebaggery. He's the movie's secret weapon, and everyone (myself included) did a double-take when they realized it was Tom Cruise in bald cap and padding. He's completely against type here and so buried in the role that believing who that is feels like a tall order.That's what makes this movie so funny: it goes there. Always out-of-bounds and going for broke. And the humor is constantly riffing on the movie industry (I imagine all the tropes are covered); it's always absurd but feels so spot-on in its satirical jabs. There's just something deranged about all of this. There's a lot of shaking your head in disbelief at what goes on here, but it's also more fun than it probably should be.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Tropic Thunder,"Tropic Thunder is an interesting take on the war genre. It involves actors going to Vietnam to record a movie about the Vietnam War and ended up actually experiencing something like the Vietnam War (not just acting).I feel like this does show RDJ's acting capabilities. He does play a black character in live action in this movie. Playing a character with a different skin color seems harder in live action than animation, with live action has the physical aspect of it. I feel like that does show how good RDJ is as an actor.I feel like this movie is built a little more on the action and comedy than the story. I feel like some things goes unexplained. It does not explain why there's a war in the first place.Overall, I find the movie alright. When it comes to visuals and acting, it's good. When it comes to story, it's alright and could be better.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Great Spoof,"Tropic Thunder (2008)**** (out of 4)Hilarious spoof of Hollywood and war movies has a group of actors making a Vietnam film when one of them are kidnapped by real terrorists and the rest must try and save him. This here is without question one of the best comedies in recent decades as the screenplay hits all the right marks and the spoof of Hollywood is just downright hilarious and more truthful than any actor would probably have you believe. I guess you could also call this movie brave on the part of many of the actors and that includes Downey who is playing a black man and probably gets the most laughs of anyone. The constant jokes of him acting and trying to speak like a black man are priceless as are the countless jokes at Stiller's character who played a retard in an earlier movie that critics hated. The comedy goes even further to make fun of just about everything in Hollywood from actors taking drugs to getting caught in the tabloids. I really loved how Stiller kicked off the movie with three fake trailers making fun of the type of movies being made in Hollywood today. The movie Grindhouse used this joke to great success but I'd say it's done even better here. What really sells this movie are the great performances from the entire cast with Downey stealing the film as the Australian actor who had his skin dyed so that he could try to win an Oscar playing a black character. The politically incorrect nature of this is always done in good taste so no one should worry about being offended. I'm not a fan of Jack Black but he too shines here as the heroin attic fat man who made a career out of farting. Then there's Stiller who really gets to have fun as the washed up action hero who tried to do something more dramatic with the role of a retard. Finally you also have to mention the supporting performances by Matthew McConaughey, Nick Nolte and Tom Cruise. All three give their best performances in many, many years but it's Cruise who really stands out as the evil, rap music dancing producer. His performance here is so incredibly crazy and out there you can't help but wish he'd get an Oscar for it. There are countless other cameos by famous people, which get some nice laughs as well. There have been countless spoofs of Hollywood but this one here certainly ranks as one of the greatest just because of the balls it shows in doing anything for a laugh.",,Anonymous,Comedy

Still sharply potent criticism of Tinseltown.,"Tropic Thunder was met with acclaim and commercial success in 2008, and met with INTENSE controversy over Robert Downy Jr.'s now infamous blackface performance in the film (not to mention Simple Jack). Yet it was PART OF THE POINT the film was making regarding the lengths some creatives will go when making feature films that will impact the world further down the track.Man: the world today feels like a totally alien place compared to 2008's landscape of global-warming preaching and 9/11 still being a very recent tragedy, and the Wii, PS3 and Xbox 360 being the then-cutting-edge game consoles, and gay jokes that would possibly be considered homophobic or some such rubbish (comedy's meant to be funny, not taken as literal demeaning mockery of real people). SO much has changed since the 2000s; fast forward to 2024 and so many of the film's jokes ARE triggering all the wrong people further proving the film's point and jokes.It's kind of sad and funny that Tropic Thunder's mockeries of Hollywood have basically come true; today's industry is playing EXACTLY like how those fake trailers framed the industry (except for the lack of animation representation) what with the tired action franchises and comedy films, and of course mid-budget indies being awards-bait films. Ben Stiller knew what he was doing when he committed to directing this metafictional mockumentary of modern American Cinema.It's funny stuff, and sadly something cinema of the 2020s seems terrified to tackle with 'crude nuance', ie South Park. Meta-comedies can be refreshing and necessary critiques for what they're mocking, and Tropic Thunder was a real treat for 2008's crowded blockbuster landscape (seriously 2008 was an ENORMOUS year for the movies).Tropic Thunder gets 8/10 IMDb points. 4/5 stars. It's still a riot. Just don't show this one to easily triggered fellas (or you can still, what the hell).",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
You People ...,"Greetings again from the darkness. Viewed as a spoof on Big Hollywood, this is pretty darn funny! Of course, we live in the time of political correctness when Eddie Murphy and Tyler Perry and Wayan brothers can make fun of people all day, but let Ben Stiller try, and we are subjected to outrage and protests from multiple self-interest groups. By age seven, most of us can tell the difference between a funny movie or comedian and the President or a Senator saying or doing something tasteless. If you can remember that this is only a movie ... you will probably laugh out loud a few times!Writer/Director/Actor Ben Stiller delivers his best work to date. The screenplay was co-written with the amazingly underrated Justin Theroux and Etan Cohen. Starring as actors in a movie that ends up being a movie about a movie that almost got made, we have Stiller, Robert Downey Jr, Jack Black, Brandon T Jackson (as Alpa Chino ... say it fast) and Jay Baruchel. These guys are all terrific and funny and are joined in support by Nick Nolte, Steve Coogan and Matthew McConaughey.As good as the overall comedic performances are, I must point out the two standouts. Robert Downey Jr is truly amazing as the high profile actor who undergoes a medical procedure to turn himself from an Australian into an African-American. Always a talented actor, Downey reaches an entirely new level with this flawless performance ... effortlessly bounding between a take-off on Russell Crowe to his tribute to Jim Brown. Just great stuff and worth the price of admission. Also a surprising treat is offered up by Tom Cruise, who leaves nothing in his bag of tricks playing an eccentric, plump, foul-mouthed, soulless, big shot studio executive. He does everything from scream obscenities to lay down some very uncomfortable dance steps! A real hoot!!!Sure, the story is a bit lame, but as in many outrageous comedies, the story is merely a backdrop for the jokes ... and there are MANY here. It will probably require a second viewing to pick up all the punchlines and visual effects, but don't miss the early ""trailers"", especially featuring Christine Taylor (Stiller's real life wife) and one of the most memorable ads that you'll wish you could forget ... complete with jingle by Brandon T Jackson.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A lightning quick wit!,"Damn, is Robert Downey Jr. on a roll Rarely (if they occur at all) have comebacks been so bold and so memorable. When slated to star as Tony Stark in May's Iron Man which kicked off the blockbuster season with a bang and a slap, the public, excluding his die-hard supporters of course, were baffled at the atypical casting choice of the Marvel hero. For myself, I have always loved Downey Jr. from his excellent portrayal as Charlie Chapin, to his perfectly suited role in Shane Black's Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, he is always the best thing about a film. Lightening struck again (or I suppose first, if you want to follow his career chronologically) midyear with his smart portrayal as an overprotective principal in Charlie Bartlet, so it only seems suitable for him to cap off the summer with his best work yet.Directed by, and starring Ben Stiller, Tropic Thunder is an epically vast improvement over the suicide inducing effort that was Zoolander and finds Stiller in his best comedic acting form since Meet the Parents. Our adventure follows a group of primadonna actors who are shooting a high budget war epic in Vietnam. As director Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan) sees his funds draining and his production falling apart at the hands of the maddeningly inept cast, the inspiration for the movie ""Four Leaf"" Tayback (Nick Nolte) suggests that the film would be better shot guerrilla style using hidden cameras and some improvisation. But, after a series of unfortunate (but hilarious) events leave the troupe stranded, they must both save the picture which their careers are riding on, and possibly themselves at the same time. Adding the flavour to this endeavour are Tugg Speedman (Stiller) as a flailing action has-been, Jack Black, who has also had a successful year, as Jeff Portnoy, an Eddie Murphy-esquire comic, Apatow regular Jay Baruchel as Kevin Sandusky, rapper turned actor Alpha Chino (Brandon T. Jackson) and of course Kirk Lazarus (Downey Jr.) as the Oscar winning method actor. We also get career high cameo and supporting work from various familiar Hollywood faces, Mathew McConaughey and the much buzzed appearance by Tom Cruise, who is simply fantastic.The most satisfying aspect of Tropic Thunder is that despite show stealing work from Cruise and Downey Jr. everyone gets their slice of the comedy pie. One actor is never in the spotlight too much, and nobody hogs the funny too much. And boy is there a lot of funny; this film is one of, if not the best satire made about Hollywood and the jokes come high and low, subtly and bluntly, and they almost always strike home. Controversy has been in the air surrounding both Downey Jr.'s blackface portrayal as an African American and gags surrounding a film Tugg Speedman had previously filmed in which he was mentally handicapped. While it is inevitable that some will be offended, it is important to remember that both of these jabs are not against such groups, but against Hollywood who churns out method actors who take their job with a block of salt, not a grain. Even complaints I have read regarding this film I see as intentional inclusions by Stiller, who I believe has been in the business too long to have done such without careful thought and consideration.The film starts without warning with a series of phony trailers featuring the stars of the feature, and are some of the funniest segments I have ever seen, especially that of Downey Jr.'s. Tropic Thunder does not let up however as the ready to quote one-lines, again mostly from Downey Jr. and Cruise, come so fast you will have to make a list once the film has concluded. All in all, this picture is what we needed, a biting satire/spoof that doesn't have the word Movie after it. With a similar action/comedy hybrid formula as this year's Pineapple Express (which both star Danny McBride), Tropic Thunder pours on the laughs like a storm and presents a wit that is nothing less then lightening quick.View all my reviews at Simon Says Movie Reviews: www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

RDJ standout in a sea of ridiculous characters,"A big budget movie shoot in Vietnam is running into difficulties. Special effects Cody (Danny McBride) wastes a big explosion when the camera isn't even shooting. Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller) is a top action star who is struggling after a few flops. Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black) is a fat hard partying sissy. Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.) is a method actor who turned himself black for the movie. Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan) is the bumbling director under tremendous pressure from the financier Les Grossman (Tom Cruise). Four Leaf Tayback (Nick Nolte) proposes to take the cast deep into the jungle to shoot guerrilla style. Only it may be too guerrilla when they run into real poppy growing local armed thugs.Written by Ben Stiller and Justin Theroux, this is a satire of a big time Hollywood production. It's a lot of stupidity. The jokes aren't necessarily sharp or biting. It is a jumble of ridiculous characters doing ridiculous things.

Really boring.,"I had a difficult time sitting through this movie. It appears to be a movie for high school boys who still laugh at farts. Toward the end I did at least smile a couple of times.

I was also surprised to see a boy about the age of 12 in the movie(he appeared to be with his Mother).

There are certainly a number of laugh-out-loud moments, but the general comedic momentum is not maintained well throughout. Robert Downey Jr. is excellent, and is really the only character who is consistently funny all through the film. Jack Black's character in the film w/in the film is great, w/ a constant stream of rapid-fire Vietnam War phrases which will delight those familiar with the lexicon. Overall, though, it's just too much start and stop w/ this movie, w/ fairly long, unfunny stretches between the clever stuff. Not as funny as Zoolander, which at times it tries to emulate.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"In the spirit of satire, it works well","This movie needs to be understood in the spirit in which it was meant. I don't like action movies or crude humour, but I enjoyed the whole because I understood where it was coming from. The initial ""trailers"" were hilarious and that gave me strong clue as to what to expect. As with The Player and Gosford Park (both by Altman) the main aim is to make a point that won't be spotted if taken at face value. This film works on a different level than a straight comedy because most of it is parody, and therefore the ""offensive"" jokes are intended to be taken in that spirit. I'm a big Robert Downey Jr fan and he was excellent in this - his true ability shone through, playing a method actor who is playing a black man playing a soldier. How many people could handle that? Jack Black's task was a bit more thankless but he made a good job of the character that he played. The cameos were great - this is another reminder of The Player (another Hollywood satire) which is full of cameos.I found the plot interesting in its own right and if you enter into the premise of what might happen if a bunch of actors were actually dumped in a jungle for real, it takes on another dimension, ie. you can also take it seriously as an adventure. I was quite gripped by the story because I wasn't sure what would happen in the end (one major character died early on). Try to suspend disbelief and not be offended, and you might enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Great comedy, sadly can't be made today","Tropic Thunder is one of the defining films of late 2000s comedy, and it shows. Many of the jokes present in the movie are ones that anyone raised after that time period would find offensive like the use of the ""r-word"" and the many stereotypes of Southeast Asian stereotypes, but that shouldn't hinder anyone from checking out this film. Even anyone born after 2008 will find this offending, they are definetly going to have a laugh. From the fake movie trailers as the cold open to the performance of Tom Cruise, there are many gags that won't age in the hearts of moviegoers. Suffice to say, even if the movie can be called outdated, anyone can find something to enjoy with this one, with the movie being further elevated by the performances of Ben Stiler, Jack Black, and Iron Man himself Robert Downey.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Good Opportunity Wasted,"Yes, I did find this movie to be funny. In fact, it was hilarious at times, but overall this was a HUGE disappointment. Believe me, I tried very hard to like it. All of the ingredients were there: great cast, talented director, good premise. What happened? When I saw the previews and saw the cast, I was absolutely sure that I would be laughing out loud from start to finish. However, somebody forgot something: a script. The movie is all over the place, and there are so many f-bombs that you feel like you are watching Scarface again. At least in Scarface a case could be made that it was somewhat appropriate. Most of the f-bombs in this film are totally unnecessary, and thus insulting to the viewer. I thought Tom Cruise's character was funny initially, but I soon grew tired of his antics and language as well, and he eventually went way over the top with his characterization. I can't believe that this movie is currently at a 7.3 rating. I say 6 tops. Anyone agree?",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Three, Five, Eight","There seen to be only eight ways for humans to reference themselves. Only 5 are considered possible though I have encountered six I believe. Rarely, three are present here.Robert Downey Jr is an actor on-screen. We never lose sight that it is he. He plays an Australian actor, loosely based on Heath Ledger. Postproduction took out some of the more obvious references to Ledger after his death and to point more to Russell Crowe, but it is clear that the transforms noted here are of the type encouraged in Australians and practiced in Batman.That character, surgically transformed, plays an African American. But it doesn't stop there. Like many black men, this one plays a character, a role. Some jokes with the ""real"" black man (who has done something similar) highlight this.Since this inner, inner, inner, inner, inner man is selfconsciously in a film, he mugs. That's five layers of identity, three of them abstractions. No one alive today could pull this off I am sure. Depp probably when he was younger. A few actresses alive could, but even they have been lazy recently. So this is something of a special experience for me.Stiller, who wrote this, creates a simpler set of folds for himself, just so that we don't miss what this is all about. We will be aware of the by now common layering of writing, directing and starring, but Stiller is the first that I know to do it like Woody does, backwards, with the character creating the writer instead of the other way. Once in the movie proper, he adopts a role of a simpleton, something he is forced into but anchors the same way that Downey's character to the fifth does.The encounter between these two quantum logical persons isn't written as cleverly as we wish  how could it be?As an incidental effect, Tom Cruise gives us a character that nearly redeems a career of energetic inadequacy. That alone might have been worth it, especially given the religious contexts. But Downey? A prince. A prince.I had dinner with a regular reader last night. Here's to him.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,Comedy

Robert Jr was good with his dialog's. The dialog where he advises Ben not to act retarded fully in a movie was good. Jack black was OK in this movie not invoking any good jokes. Ben stiller is good at his direction and acting.The comic story line is what makes this movie one of the best comedy movie.Action sequence are made well.

"Tropic Thunder,hmm...","Tropic Thunder is rather entertaining even if you haven't seen the movies which it's taking the mickey out of, really. I found all the war movie references hilarious and could relate them back to the original things. But it is not just a comment or parody on war movies but a parody of the movie business in general.Even the false previews at the beginning made me laugh, because they seemed so ridiculous. But then I realised that some movie previews actually are ridiculous. Like the ones which are just another copy of the first movie you've seen. Like carbon copies of the first one.In this movie, the storyline was a little bit implausible but still funny enough to let me into the world and I found the characters particularly interesting in their comments and reactions towards each other.They really made the movie though and they each had traits which made them easily identifiable, unlike some war movies where all the characters sort of mush into each other and become faces rather than people.As a parody, I'd have to say that this movie is a success. It really manages to echo the film industry and war films in a way which shows the characters and without becoming too obsessed with creating too many different elements which become confused.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Welcome to the goodie roomTropic Thunder,"Despite my somewhat indifference, bordering on dislike, of Ben Stiller and most of what he does, Tropic Thunder has been on my much-anticipated list for some time now. The audacity of what he was attempting, spoofing the industry that was giving him the money to do so, blatantly and lovingly, was too great to ignore. And then there is the cast of stars with cameo after cameo of surprise faces joining in on the fun, not to mention the intense marketing strategy pushing it along. Websites for each fictional actor, a site with clips from the Rain of Madness making of documentary (a Heart of Darkness send up ""directed"" by co-writer Justin Theroux), and even a faux E! True Hollywood Story to air the week before its premiere in theatres just add to the mythology and attention to detail that went into its making. Now, having finally seen the end result, I must say it didn't let me down. True, I was expecting more in the way of story and plot, especially with all that background info manufactured, but when you get down to it, the entertainment value is off the charts, the one-liners are going to be quoted for years to come, and the laughs come often and hard.To take on subject matter as lofty as a send-up to war films, mainly Apocalypse Now, needs a certain amount to bravery and confidence to not care if it all backfires. The production value and effects make this seem as though it is a certified blockbuster falling apart at the seams. Sure the characters are funny and the events on display hilarious, but by the look and feel of the aesthetic, this is a war film to the end. Between that realism and the love I have for meta-narrative, there was little chance Stiller would be bombing in my eyes. Something about movies within movies intrigue the heck out of me, and this one having actors within actors just played up my interest more. There was truly no better way to start this movie then how was done: the playing of Alpa Chino's rap music, consumerism selling commercial and trailers for our three leads' previous films. What better way to be introduced to our action star, our funnyman, and our award winning thespian? Knowing full well the extent of satire going on, each spot delivers, giving a little background into the work these men have done in the past.Directly connecting with the subsequent shot, a live scene from the film at hand, the egos finally come out and show face. Jack Black's Jeff Portney reins in his comedian schtick to portray a hardened solider, voice rasping as he shows his serious side; Stiller's Tugg Speedman attempts to revive the action cred he tried to leave behind with his Oscar-bait turn as a mentally handicapped man in Simple Jack, where he went ""full retarded, no one ever comes back from that""; and Robert Downey Jr.'s Kirk Lazarus, Australian genius at his craft, playing a black man like he was born one. The scene continues without a hitch, explosions everywhere, screams heard in the distance, and a heartfelt death about to be delivered, until the men show their true colors. Tugg can't make himself cry, (he's just not that good), and Kirk's blubbering and drooling is just so real that the two must partake in a pissing match while effects guru Cody, (the red hot of late Danny McBride), let's loose the one-take only scorched earth fire storm. It's all falling apart and script-writer/former soldier Four Leaf, (the always gruff Nick Nolte), gets the director, (Steve Coogan with one of the best film exits I've ever seen), to agree on guerilla filming, deep in the jungle of foreign lands. Here is where the fun begins and where the movie inside the movie becomes real, or, in effect, the actual moviekind of like ""the dude playing the dude, disguised as another dude"". The levels at play here are just too many to mention.Besides a weakly written role for Black, the rest of the men are given enough to work with for some truly great moments. Stiller has a few instances where he returns to his over-long annoying routinepouring ""fake"" blood into his mouth for onebut for the most part did a real good job, especially with his tough guy poses shooting off his gun. Jay Baruchel shines as the only non-celebrity involved, the guy who went to boot camp, read the novel and the script, and idolizes the men he is working with. Good to see him get a more beefed up role as opposed to the side parts in Apatow films. And the back and forth between Downey Jr. and Brandon T. Jackson's Alpa never get old. The whole dynamic of real black man versus fake was unceasingly funny.There were plot points that irked me throughout, TiVo's cameo being the biggest culprit, but I found myself pushing the problems aside and just enjoying the ride. Downey Jr.'s facial expressions, voices, and presence may steal the show, but what really allowed me to forget my worries was an absolutely brilliant cameo from Tom Cruise. His studio executive, pompously crass, loud-mouth made me think of all the horror stories you hear about the Weinsteins, and his dance moves can not be equaled. Tropic Thunder is first and foremost a vehicle for a bunch of friends to have a blast poking fun at their craft and really at themselves. I'll be remembering quotes all night now, thinking that while the story itself doesn't necessitate me watching it again soon, the jokes just might make buying it a mustnot to mention the wealth of extras that DVD is sure to have.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Hilarious Great Fun.,"Even before the opening credits this movie starts with the comedy & rarely leaves you with a moment of something hilarious.Now I can tell you this movie is really NOT for everyone. There are plenty of reasons to get offended I suppose but it's not done with the intent of offending someone. For example Robert Downey taking his characters way too serious ""I don't leave character until I do the DVD commentary"".Everyone in the cast is great, with the stand outs being Robert Downey Jr. & the surprise cameos especially from Tom Cruise. The rest do their jobs as needed to drive home the comedy.Now the action is pretty funny as well, overly dramatic & overly graphic sometimes but never overwhelming.A great directorial debut from Stiller & a wonderful reminder why some of these actors are as loved as they are.

Like Zoolander in the Jungle,"Saw this for the first time finally. It has a couple of very funny scenes, about a dozen scenes that made me giggle, and another dozen amusing jabs at Hollywood and actors that were good.However, as a whole, based on the raving reviews and popularity of it, it wasn't as good as I expected. The main reason why is the devolution into action scene cliches with the bad guys during the whole climax. One reviewer wrote the word ""cringeworthy"", and that is definitely fitting for many scenes.Still, it's a mixed bag because some jokes and scenes are landing mixed in there, and that's why it reminded me of Zoolander in the jungle. Some jokes land, while others miss, and there isn't much consistency in that regard.Everyone already knows how great Downey Jr. was so there isn't much more to say there. It was a really phenomenal piece of acting by him. Stiller is his goofy-funny usual self.I was never a big Zoolander fan, but I'm not even sure this is even as funny as that. For Stiller, I have at least three other movies of his I would rank above this: Something About Mary, Meet the Parents, and Dodgeball were all funnier than this for me. This wouldn't land even in my top 20 comedy list with films like those, Caddyshack, Dumb and Dumber, Vacation and Christmas Vacation just to name some of the best.It was decent for a one time watch though just to catch up.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Not A Home Run Movie, But Probably A Base Hit","I am probably going to get a lot of scrutiny for this review, but I really don't care. The truth is that I saw it, I liked it, but I didn't love it the way I thought I would. Let's face it: this summer has had some surprises, and a few movies that have lived up to their hype. ""Iron Man"" was one of those pleasant surprises, and ""The Dark Knight"" fit into the latter category.However, ""Iron Man"" and ""The Dark Knight"" are not comedies, and therefore are not as subjective. In other words, there are rarely any mixed reviews for these movies. Comedies are more hit or miss, and this comedy was a mixed bag for me.I was expecting an over the top farce on Hollywood, and that's exactly what I got. There's a potential problem in that when comedic actors try to spoof the so-called corrupt movie industry, 95% of the audience don't normally get the jokes because they haven't worked in Hollywood. However, one of the movie's strengths is that Ben Stiller, who also wrote and directed this film, made some smart choices in terms of on screen gags and certain cameos to bring a majority of the audience in with the joke. For instance, the mock previews at the beginning of the film were brilliantly over the top. And it was funny to see Tom Cruise as an overweight, short-tempered studio executive.Also, the movie's #1 strength can be summarized in three words: ROBERT DOWNEY, JR. He was just fantastic in this film. Of course, he's going to face a lot of scrutiny for his role since he spends a majority of it in black-face, but he really nailed the method actor spoof incredibly well. As long as people see that he's making fun of actors who take themselves too seriously, not people of color, they'll enjoy every minute he's on the screen. I would even go as far as to say that Downey could even be a potential nominee for Best Supporting Actor at next year's Oscars. You may think I'm crazy, but remember that Madelyn Kahn was nominated for her role in ""Blazing Saddles"" back in 1975. Downey's scenes with rapper/actor Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson, a great straight man in this film) were pretty good, too.Unfortunately, there were some major inconsistencies with the plot and the character development which, had they been explained better, would have resulted in a funnier film. For instance, Ben Stiller plays an Arnold Schwarzeneggar/Sylvester Stallone like action hero who wants to be taken more seriously as an actual actor, which is understandable. However, it is never explained why he kept making those action movies which make him look like a one trick pony. Stiller's character came off more as a cheap ripoff of White Goodman (from ""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"" (2004)) and Derek Zoolander (from ""Zoolander"" (2001)) combined. There could have been a lot more originality and depth in his character, but the scenes of him as ""Simple Jack"" were funny enough to expose his character's vanity.Furthermore, why would a movie studio hire a first time director (Steve Coogan) to shoot a big budget movie about Vietnam? This is a spoof movie on Hollywood with a lot of name dropping, and no one thought to explain why Oliver Stone wasn't hired, or Francis Ford Coppola. That was a missed opportunity to get a good laugh, and to remove a plot inconsistency.I love Jack Black, but man, was he a disappointment in this movie! Speaking of plot inconsistencies, it was never explained nor mentioned why Black, as an A-list comedic actor by the likes of Mike Myers or Eddie Murphy, was cast in a serious movie about the Vietnam War. His character appeared to express no motivation to have a serious role, and his drug-addiction antics were also flat and not even worthy of a light chuckle. His character was direction-less, and he really could have been written a lot better for Jack Black's sake. After all, Black is extremely talented and incredibly funny. To see his talent go to waste in this movie is too bad.I'm sure my disappointment in this movie comes from waiting four months in anticipation for its release. But I reiterate when I say that I'm not entirely disappointed with this movie. There were some moments of big laughs, and those moments came when it didn't seem as though the cast (or the script) tried too hard for a laugh. There were just some missed opportunities for laughs, especially in relation to war movies. For instance, they were shooting a Vietnam movie, yet it seemed as thought the only movie they could spoof was ""Platoon"" (1986) with Ben Stiller copying Willem Dafoe's famous arms in the air pose. There were also some key opportunities to spoof ""Full Metal Jacket"" (1987) or ""Born on the Fourth of July"" (1989). After all, with Tom Cruise in the cast, how could they not reference that movie? So I'm marginally recommending this film. It was good, but not great, and it's worthy of being rented. Robert Downey, Jr. was this movie's saving grace, and he's really the comeback kid of 2008.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Downey, Cruise and nothing","This film is part of a limited, but toxic genre, a category I call, ""Gene Wilder Gone Mad"". It is driven by vanity,(Stiller's) and his mistaken belief that anything he does is hilarious. Unfortunately, we are left to fast forward around him to get to the nuggets of talent that characterize Downey's tour de force. Much sound and fury,about less than nothing.By contrast, it is astounding to watch Downey present us with simultaneous layers of an actor-within-an actor within an actor walking through a meaningless film while stepping back to remind the cast and us that it's only a movie.Downey's take on acting black--or is he ""being"" black, is in stark contrast with the film's take on Asians, reminding one of Brando's comment on Larry King's show several years ago. in which he described Hollywood as the most racist of cultural centers.And then there's the surrealism of Tom Cruise's performance; astonishing! My final thought is that Ben Stiller should step back from believing his, or his friend's flattery. It's like the manager of a ball team--I think it was Chuck Dressen and the Dodgers, saying, ""Act as if you've been there, before!""",,Anonymous,Comedy

"comedy, fast and furious, and plenty of it","A bunch of prissy actors making a Vietnam War movie are thrown into guerrilla-style movie-making by their put-upon director. A series of freak accidents sees them fighting heavily-armed heroin producers in the Golden Triangle of South-east Asia.Now, having said that, this film needs a plot outline like Bill Gates needs a handout. The comedy is hit-and-miss, but comes so fast, and in such quantity, that you never need to dwell on the dull moments. Audiences will be discussing their favourite lines for years to come. Personally, pretty much everything that came out of Robert Downey Jr. as a method-obsessed Aussie star (taking the pish out of Russel Crowe may be the bravest decision Stiller made in this film) was a gem, but ""I don't read scripts, scripts read me"" takes some beating. Stiller is always better when reacting than acting. Here, he tries to be the funny one too often, and so gets little chance to do what he does best. Jack Black is a disappointment, the over-acting that served him so well in School of Rock is cringe-inducing here.It is not as cynical as The Player, or as playful as Bowfinger, but TT finds its niche in the genre of Hollywood parodies based on its shotgun approach. The comedy works best when it comes from the interplay of characters - Lazarus and Alpa Chino especially. It is less funny when parodying well-known scenes from Platoon, Apocalypse Now and bizarrely, Close Encounters. Tom Cruise does outstanding work as the ego-maniacal producer, but that particular archetype is slightly too well-worn. Cruise does well with a familiar type, rather than breaking new ground.TT needs more than one viewing to appreciate all the gags. I for one will go back to it.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

So absurd and clever you can't help but laugh at it,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningMega stars from the world of action, Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller), comedy, Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black) and serious drama Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.) have come together to make Tropic Thunder, a big budget action picture set in the jungles of South East Asia. Unfortunately, the director Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan) is having a terrible time of making it, and Les Grossman (Tom Cruise), the studio head financing it, orders him to take his three stars on a tour around the volatile area without the cameras and crew following them around so they get a feel for the real danger they need to portray. However, after Cockburn's unfortunate death, the team realize this may not be as safe a learning experience as they thought.I've never been a massive fan of Ben Stiller, but Tropic Thunder is probably his best film since Meet the Parents. Not that that's any great shakes, as even that was only awarded ***, but in terms of Stiller and his brand of comedy, this is another big hit (as opposed to something like, say, Zoolander which flew right over me.)This is a film obsessed with being clever and taking the p!ss. From the trailers at the beginning, sending up big budget, no brainer action films, the low brow humour of American comedies, and Robert Downey Jr, who appears to be sending up Russell Crowe, Mr. T from The A Team and, er, himself. Quite how Stiller managed to get all these big name stars involved (many of which in roles they'd never normally do) for something that, while funny is hardly the most hilarious idea ever, is anyone's guess, but do it he has. The sheer absurdity of it all is what generates most of the laughs, from Stiller's mentally impaired farmboy act that amuses those who come to be his captors, Black's obnoxious fatty with a secret drug problem and, of course, Cruise's bumpin' and grindin' studio exec. The break-through role though, is that of child star Brandon Soo Hoo, as a high pitched, angry, kung fu kicking child commander of the Asian army. The film's problems, though, are a disjointed plot and being at least ten minutes too long, but with all those egos wanting to hog all that screen time, a lot more probably ended up on the cutting room floor.Tropic Thunder is not the greatest comedy ever. It's not even really good. But it's an undeniably clever send up of Hollywood and famous actors that gets by on how absurd it all is as well. ***",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Muh-muh-makes Me Happy,"Stellar comedic performances all around (mostly). Each character is a solid criticism of a specific style of actor, and each of the performances really hits the mark with one notable exception. Ben Stiller has his typical ""trying too hard"" comedic styling, and unfortunately he just doesn't fit the role of the action star trying to stay relevant by switching to drama. We also see what could have been a fantastic turn from Tom Cruise, but unfortunately the joke wears thin with the more screen time he has. Robert Downey Jr is the real standout here, and he absolutely kills it with a masterful comedic performance that in a year with less competition may have actually gotten him the win for Best Supporting Actor.While the movie is offensive, it never goes for the simple shock value joke which allows it to age surprisingly well. There are many taboo joke subjects in here, but the movie never punches down and smartly focuses on and makes the jokes at the expense of the actors/industry as opposed to the real world aspects that the characters within the movie are attempting to portray.A very fun watch with a funny and interesting exploration of what it means to be an actor in Hollywood.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Egregious amounts of violence crop up, but they're mitigated by the constant silliness surrounding them. Still, when it's funny, it's really funny. Topped by so many scene-stealing performances from its cast, in particular from Robert Downey Jr. And Tom Cruise (seriously, Les Grossman might be one of the finest characters ever created, the real big d*ck playa), Tropic Thunder showcases everything that's wrong with modern Hollywood and does it with major style and adequate sucking of another man's unit.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

You Will Laugh Yourself Retarded,This is a funny movie. If you enjoy some low brow humor then it is funnier. If you enjoy juvenile humor then you may fall out of your seat because it is so funny. Ben Stiller has done it again and done it well. Not only did he help write the movie but he directed it too. Then he added Jack Black who is on fire with a string of comedies. Then Stiller added Robert Downey Jr. put him in black face and in doing so almost secured a supporting actor nomination. Amazing.Tropic Thunder is about a film crew in Asia filming a memoir about the Vietnam War. An accident happens and in a twist of comic fate the crew nor the actors realize they are being attacked by local drug dealers and not other actors in the film. The real actors band together attempt a rescue.The film got into some degree of trouble when some groups came out against the movie claiming it unfairly was attacking challenged people. In the movie those type of people are called retards. So get ready to be shocked or disgusted depending on your level and limits of humor. The real jewel of the movie is Robert Downey Jr. Every second of him on film is comedy gold. The film is also a who's who from Hollywood. There is even some very funny moments from a scene with Tom Cruise. I doubt you will be able to name all the cameos. This is a funny movie and if you have any affinity for Ben Stiller then you'll love this film and want to own it. **/****  As for the poster design they take their cues from what has come before them and try to make fun of it. I think the movie was a lot more creative than the campy poster and I would have liked to see the designer do more than just a Chuck Norris/ Schwartzenegger take off.,7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
There's no comedy like this,"Tropic Thunder his one of the greatest comedies ever made. I feel like this was ahead of its time back in 2008. And it definitely wouldn't be made in 2023.This movie was made in a time when people didn't get offended by small things in life. The whole ""black face"" controversy with RDJ's character going next level method acting by ""becoming"" black would definitely not slide today. Funny enough, nobody is actually taking offense to RDJ other than the people who aren't even supposed to take offense to it.But Tropic Thunder also got me was in the beginning of the movie with all those fake movie trailers. They nailed the aspect of the 2000's movie trailers, including a lame action sequel, the goofy toilet humor comedy, and a serious drama (which ends up being more goofy that the first two).This movie even includes a rare sight of Tom Cruise playing a comedic role as Les Grossman. Why can't Tome Cruise do more comedies like this? He's definitely a hidden gem in comedy besides being the kick ass star of action thrillers.Tropic Thunder is just hilarious, and we desperately need another movie like this. If only Hollywood had the guts to just make a movie like this without having to give in to social-political norms.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I like this...,"TROPIC THUNDERI had seen this when it first came out and I was very disappointed with it. I remember it being not very funny, and all the funny bits were in the trailer. Now after a few years, I decided to watch it again I really liked it.The movie is about a bunch of actors who are shooting a war movie called Tropic Thunder. The whole shoot is a disaster so the director decides to end them to Vietnam to shoot the movie in the real jungle. Everything sounds like it will make a good movie until they get attacked upon by a group of drug dealers but the actors think it's all part of the movie! It is a comedy, and there are some very funny moments in the film. I love the use of language it is executed so well.The actors do a great job even the ones I don't like did really well. Tropic Thunder stars Ben Stiller (who also directed it), Jack Black, Robert Downey Jr. & Anthony Ruivivar. I quite like Ben Stiller. He has made some very good films, but in general he can be a little bit annoying. But he was very funny in this film. Jack Black is an actor that I am not very keen on. I think he is over the top and very annoying, but he has also made some good movies. I just don't really like his acting style but again, in this he did a very good job and was not annoying at all. He was actually funny. I am a big Robert Downey Jr. fan I think he has made some amazing movies and plays all the roles with passion and really does a great job especially in Natural Born Killers. Finally, Anthony Ruivivar I don't think I have seen anything with him in before. He was very funny and really fit in well with the other actors.There were a lot of other famous faces that had smaller roles, but really made their mark in the movie. Matthew McConaughey played Bens agent he was not in the movie a lot, but was still funny. Nick Nolte plays an ex Vietnam veteran, whose life story is what the film is about Nick has gone off of the rails, but he really is a good actor and it was good to see him in this. I hope to see him in more in the future. Steve Coogan plays the movies director. Steve is another actor that annoys me a little bit. I just don't find the man funny. He was not that bad in this. But the best character for me was definitely Les Grossman played by Tom Cruise! The thing I love about Tom is he can play any kind of character. He doesn't normally play comedy roles, but when he does he is so funny. Especially his dance. His character in this was hilarious. He had some of the best lines in the movie and he delivered them perfectly. I was crying with laughter when he was on the screen. There were quite a few other famous faces that had cameos in the movie but if you have not seen it, it is more fun trying to spot them. Good luck.The beginning of the movie was brilliant at first I thought I pressed the wrong button on my DVD player. I pressed play and a load of movie trailers started playing. They are fake trailers for the movie, but they were really well made. It was a great way and a different way to start a movie. Very unique and entertaining.The story is very good, the acting is very good and the comedy is outrageous in places but funny.I will give this film 7 out of 10.""I don't read the script, script reads me.""For more reviews, please check out my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Above your average ridiculously stupid comedy,"A question of comparison almost as common as ""Pepsi or Coca Cola?"" that often arises asks to choose the favourite between Adam Sandler or Ben Stiller. Both have very different comedic styles that cater to different kinds of audiences: Sandler is more exaggerated and crude, while Stiller seems to be more sophisticated and gravitates more towards parody than grossing out, although in my opinion he is the less funny of the two. So while Zoolander was a very clever send-up of the male fashion world, it just wasn't that funny besides the uncanny number of celebrity cameos. Luckily for Stiller, in his most recent directorial effort, Tropic Thunder, which parodies every possible aspect and angle of Hollywood  actors, producers, directors, screenwriters, agents, genres, award shows, trailers, and everything in between  he brings along a crew of hilarious comic talents to help him deliver the laughs.The film is, first and foremost, a rather clever parody of everything Hollywood, featuring washed-up action stars, prestigious Oscar-winning Australian method actors, overweight, drug-addicted comedic actors who appear in multiple roles in crude humour movies, rappers making the transition into film, actors who play mentally disabled characters for awards attention, crazed producers, British theatre directors making their film debuts, novelists who are exposed as frauds, crazed agents, and many more. The film-within-a-film, the Vietnam war epic Tropic Thunder, which appears prominently in the first few scenes of the film, is also a clever and more subtle prod at war epics, featuring over-the-top gore, exaggerated pyrotechnics and every cliché in the book. These elements are no doubt the contribution of Justin Theroux to the screenplay. Theroux hasn't actually written any screenplays before, but as an actor he often plays these kind of slyly, subtly comic characters, and it seems to fit his style. Then again, the film also contains a scene in which a character wrestles with a panda bear, eventually kills it and wears its skin, so the movie's styles and levels of humour are evidently varied.Most of the flat-out jokes in the film aren't quite as funny as they could be, but the film benefits from an exquisite collective of comic genius at its core. Stiller himself, although playing the main character, plays him as the straightest arrow in the group and in the least exaggerated manner, and thus puts himself really aside the comic limelight and lets his co-stars take centre stage. Each one has his shining moment, including Jay Baruchel and Nick Nolte, and Jack Black in particular has two or three scenes that he just lets loose and gives it his all. But there's no doubt about it that this is Robert Downey, Jr.'s show.Downey, Jr. has, in the last couple of years of his comeback, shown superb acting virtuosity in both comedic (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, A Scanner Darkly) and dramatic (Fur, Zodiac) roles in small indie films, but 2008 will certainly go down in history as the defining year for him, the year where at long last the talented but troubled actor has hit A-list status and has become a bona-fide movie star, bringing in the crowd. Showcasing lighter fare in Iron Man and comic genius in Tropic Thunder, one can only wonder how he will fare dramatically in Joe Wright's The Soloist, out later this year. I have my fingers crossed for Downey, especially since he absolutely carried Tropic Thunder and delivered the funniest lead performance in a very bold feat of portraying a black man that worked off perfectly.But with all due respect to Downey, Jr., even he is out-acted by the extended cameo role that totally steals the show. It took me quoting lines from Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia to my friends for them to realize that the actor portraying the hairy, bald, overweight film producer Les Grossman is none other than Tom Cruise. Off-screen persona aside, there's no denying Cruise's abilities in this movie. He is still one of the most talented, screen presence-commanding actors working today, and his show-stealing, profanity-laden performance in Tropic Thunder just further proves his ability at carrying a movie and stealing the show, even when he's only in it for a few scenes. Downey, Jr. carried the film, but Cruise was the highlight of the experience for me.There's no tiptoeing around the fact that Tropic Thunder is a ridiculously stupid movie. But the fact that it's so over-the-top shows that, naturally, it doesn't take itself seriously. Combining clever lampooning of everything that signifies modern Hollywood with brilliant, all-cylinders-pumping comedic performances from the likes of Jack Black and Robert Downey, Jr., Tropic Thunder places itself above your average ridiculously stupid comedy.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Self-aware absurdity,"I finally got around to seeing this because Severance has me on a Ben Stiller kick. I knew I loved his work when I first saw The Secret Life of Walter Mitty in theaters, but his artistry is already apparent here. I do still hold the belief that he is only getting better with each consecutive project, so even though I like some of the others better than this, it is still a very good film. I see both why it has been praised so immensely over the years, and also why it was all my junior high friends could talk about when it first came out. It's a strange mixture that both appeals to young boys humor and those who appreciate slightly darker or more offensive jokes, but in a way that at its core is not actually making fun of anyone other than the Hollywood elite. What seems like it could be a very offensive section repeating the word ""retarded"" countless times, is actually just a commentary about how insensitive it is for the actors that play those type of roles as nothing other than Oscar bait. It's the same point they're making by having Robert Downey Jr. Basically dress in blackface for the whole movie. This is the sort of thing that, even though it's clearly both a joke and a commentary about the whole film industry, it wouldn't be unlikely to hear people crying for this film to be removed from streaming services because this is ""insensitive."" But thankfully I think everyone gets the point it's trying to make. And really I think that's what sums this movie up well: self-awareness. It knows what it is and doesn't take itself too seriously, while also being a big budget Hollywood movie that is completely self-aware of how ridiculous Hollywood was at the time (and still is today. This movie may actually be relevant today than it even was then), and on top of all of that, it includes a star studded cast that play extremely self-aware roles. Never in my life would I have expected to see Tom Cruise in a role like this. He strikes me as the type who is too worried about his image to allow himself to look so idiotic, yet here he is. And it's hilarious. This is one of the few movies I've seen that is so blatantly aware of everything related to it and the entire movie industry. It honestly is incredibly well done, and the fact that it got multiple genuine laughs from me is a plus.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Daring and Awesome!,"I have just seen a movie that's so awesome it raises awesomeness to a whole new level then proceeds to be so awesome that it raises awesomeness from that new level to another new level of awesomeness and proceeds to do this until I found myself in awesome heaven.This movie is Ben Stiller's daring, imaginative, original, intelligent, clever, witty, biting satire on Hollywood. This gut-bustingly hilarious masterwork of sheer brilliance dares to subvert Hollywood expectations resulting in a daring, imaginative, original, intelligent, clever, witty, biting satire on Hollywood.Ben Stiller provides a film that challenges our rosy view of Hollywood by radically suggesting that studio execs are fat, balding idiots whose reading doesn't extend beyond MAXIM. He also suggests that method actors sometimes go too far. He also dares to suggest that Hollywood actors may be exploitative in their approach to playing mentally special people and their reasons for doing so. He also dares to suggest that war movies are far too fake and glorifying, and that booty-obsessed rappers may be closet homosexuals.I, of course, am utterly STUNNED. I could never have seen these things without Ben Stiller telling me about them.People, I'm telling you, Ben Stiller is such an auteur to the power of awesome that he is so legendary in terms of auterness that he makes Melville, Godard, Chabrol, Rivette, Moretti, and McG look like the cinema's worst hacks.This film also features awesome-bar-raising masterpieces of action to rival only Chuck Norris' cinematic masterpiece ""Delta Force"", and countless sight gags so original and brilliant and well-staged that they make Tati look like Jerry Lewis post-1965.""Tropic Thunder"" will become a legendary masterpiece of awesome for daring to mock Hollywood in a completely original manner and by pointing out things I never would have thought of before. This is so awesome in all its awesome glory that I was laughing non-stop, and I laughed hardest during the Lance Bass cameo! ""Tropic Thunder"" achieves a new plateau in comedy film-making. It takes the greatest comedy of all time and then awesomely blows it into chunks then spills the contents of its head. A week after the horrendous ""Pineapple Express"", which was just about talking and tried to be in several genres at once (how stupid!), ""Tropic Thunder"" provides awesome action and biting satire like no other.10/10",,Anonymous,Comedy
Make Fun Not War,"A comedic war movie about the making of a blockbuster war movie. Ben Stiller once again plays a buffoon (not quite Zoolander, but one with absolutely no clue how low he's sunk), Jack Black is a fat drug addict (so is he actually acting?) and Robert Downey Jr. turns in a great and funny role as a method actor who gets REALLY into his roles, playing an Australian who's playing a BLACK army sergeant (and he never turns it off, even when talking to another black actor!). A great cameo by Matthew McConnaughy as a low-level agent and a hilarious and surprising part by Tom Cruise as a balding, overweight, foul-mouthed Hollywood producer. It has it's funny parts (though one of the funniest Jack Black lines from the trailer was unfunnied for the film) and the usual weird, semi-uncomfortable Stiller comedy standards, and the story was quite entertaining.

"""He Who Must Not Be Named"" brings down the house, steals what is probably the smartest, dumbest, and arguably the best comedy of 2008","Very rarely do comedies hit the mark in terms of both smart humor and dumb humor in the same movie, let alone the same scene. That's what we've got with Tropic Thunder, a comedy that excels in both satirical jokes and laugh out loud stupidity. If you're game for any of that, in addition to quite possibly the funniest and most shocking cameos of all time, then Tropic Thunder is the perfect movie to close the summer of 2008 with.Ben Stiller has always been the poster boy for trying to mix these two severely different types of humor recently, and has failed in his other two main directing attempts (although Zoolander was funny). Here, he more than succeeds in making Hollywood the laughingstock of the summer, and who better than Stiller to do so, someone who has been around the business his entire life.Obviously, what's going to get the most laughs is our cast, which is one of the best comedy casts assembled, in my opinion. Our supporting performers are just as strong, if not stronger than our big three leads (definitely stronger than Jack Black), and we are treated to some of the funniest cameos of all time...One of Tropic Thunder's cameos, one of the most famous and serious actors in the world, nearly steals the movie, and is funnier than the last time he did a role like this (Austin Powers 3). If you don't know who I'm talking about by now, just wait until you see him. He'll have you on the floor laughing by the end of the movie. Other cameos (including a Judd Apatow boy and a former People's Sexiest Man Alive) are entertaining, but they have nothing on the big guy.Now, to the actual cast...Starting with Stiller himself. Stiller has always been great at playing over the top asses, and that's what his character here is. There's plenty of exaggeration, plenty of laughs, but I felt there could have been more arrogance and more development in his character. The film belongs to Robert Downey Jr. (why am I not shocked by this?), who could sneak a Golden Globe nomination in if he's lucky for his performance as super-serious star Kurt Lazarus. Downey is absolutely hilarious, yet believable as this actor who believes acting is larger than life, and provides for the best satire of all. Jack Black is, if anything, forgettable and provided few laughs (though he does deliver one of the funniest lines of the movie). Jay Baruchel and Brandon Jackson are great in their supporting roles, and were the most well rounded characters (especially Baruchel). Danny McBride (three out of the last four movies I've watched have had this guy in it) of Pineapple Express is just as great here in another hilarious role tailor made for him. Nick Nolte is an odd presence, but an asset nonetheless. Steve Coogan's short role is memorable.Stiller's main point in the film was obviously to make fun of Hollywood and his fellow actors as well, and he succeeds enormously. The fact that mentally challenged rights groups are calling for boycotts only proves Stiller's point: we all need to chill out, and stop taking things so seriously (where's The Joker when you need him?). The ""bad"" scene where the characters say 'retard' a few times is actually one of the best satire scenes in the movie. The scene isn't making fun of mentally challenged people, rather the actors that have won Oscars for playing them. Dustin Hoffman and Peter Sellers are not spared.Like Pineapple Express before it, Tropic Thunder suffers from a less than stellar second act, which is used to attempt to ground the film in reality. This is unnecessary. We know that this could never happen. Insurance policies wouldn't even let a director think about doing what Coogan's character does in this film. However, the film starts and finishes very well (in fact, it starts better than any comedy of the year). It finishes with roars of laughter, and even though it is just absurd, it doesn't matter, because we've had a great time along the ride. Yes, Tropic Thunder is vulgar, but nowhere near the other Apatow brand products out these days. There's some blood and graphic violence, but nothing too bad.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Great Fun,"Tropic Thunder sports a stellar cast in this summer's blockbuster spoof movie. Ben Stiller stars as a mega-action hero in what is supposed to be a jungle warfare film.When the production studio threatens to pull the plug on a big budget action story, the director takes his film to a new level. The actors are suddenly thrust into a real-life story - fighting groups of merciless bandits and narcotics traffickers in Asia.Led by a young boy, the rebels take the actors hostage - demanding $100 million for their release. But the actors soon step up to the challenge. A series of terrific pyrotechnics displays erupts, followed by a glamorous Hollywood ending.For all its flaws, Tropic Thunder is a non-stop action adventure. Robert Downey Jr. is particularly convincing in his role as an African American fighter. Ben Stiller toned up and toughened up as he took on a Ramboesque role as the platoon's head honcho.A great film; lots of fun",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

In truth, some grins and chuckles are found here and there (I noticed the audience reaction was very subdued), but not enough to elevate this to the next level - a six is the highest grade it can be awarded.

Maverick from Top Gun,"Tropic Thunder is an interesting experience to say the least, because we get to see all of these different ""chops"" of actors who have an acting skill set playing roles that are not usually shown, but are on display in this movie. Ultimately we see an experiment that is somewhat hit or miss at times, but more often than not it is a hit. Though the movie's story, jokes, and what not are fairly decent, what makes this movie shine are the actors turning in these performances that are just so out what they would typically play.Robert Downey Jr. for beginners, who starred earlier this year as Iron Man and is having an incredible comeback into the film business, now puts his sites into playing an Australian character actor Kirk Lazarus, who goes so into character he turns himself into an African-American. The best way to gauge if you'll find this funny or not is to just watch the trailer, if anything gave you the slightest smile, then his performance throughout the rest of the movie will no doubt sell you on him as a great comedic actor. As far as those who are actually naive enough to believe this is a racist gesture? Swallow your pride and pull your head out if your back door; though also you people who feel this way, shouldn't even be watching the movie in the first place.As for the other two great performances in this movie they come from Mattew McConaughey playing out of his typical chick-flick character as Ben Stiller's agent, who has few laughs throughout the film. Perhaps though the best surprise in the movie is Tom Cruise, who is covered in prosthetics to become the hairy business mogul that is financing the movie. This character is so vulgar, and disgusting it's enjoyable. If anyone else played this character it wouldn't have been the same, but the fact that it is Tom Cruise, Maverick from Top Gun, playing him just makes it so precious. Jay Baruchel (from Knocked-Up), Brandon Jackson, and Steve Coogan (Hamlet 2), not memorable, but still solid supporting performances to round out the celebrity filled cast. Oh yeah, and Nick Nolte is in it, and is decent too (just thought I would throw that in there). Then you get characters like Ben Stiller, Jack Black, and Danny McBride, who play the typical characters that they play in every other movie, which really doesn't make them all that memorable. On another note Danny McBride, who was not too long ago in Pineapple Express, I personally deplore this guy, he's not funny and is stupid, much like Dane Cook... and like Dane Cook, will probably end up with an undeserved career.Perhaps though the weakest point of the movie all together, aside from McBride, is just the concept of the movie. It doesn't know what kind of movie it is. It's not silly and funny enough to be an excellent comedy movie; and while the action and special effects for the most part are excellent, the action is just too silly (which I know it is trying to do), to be a good war/action movie. Which can fall flat at times because it just feels like a half-hearted attempt at being a good comedy movie, and a good action movie, but not an exceptional of either. Though, it is obvious what kind of attention they were trying to accomplish.Ben Stiller, definitely has some ability behind a camera and for writing a script. Even though he did make Zoolander, and the underrated Cable Guy, neither of those were as good as this movie. For the most part the movie looked polished, the script flowed well, and the characters were fantastic. I would love to see him turn more movies out, and possibly try his hand at a dramatic movie.Pros: Downey Jr., McConaughey, Cruise, all deliver stand-out performances, and are well written characters. Tons, of little celebrity cameos make it worth watching just to recognize throughout the movie. Has good polished Hollywood charm to it that you can't quite put your finger on. Also kind cool to see what Ben Stiller is really made of behind a camera. Faux movie trailers at the beginning were funny also.Cons: Stiller and Black turn out regular performances that aren't bad, but aren't anything new either. Danny McBride is a talentless bore. Isn't a really good comedy movie, isn't a really good action/war movie either.Overall: Definitely worth the theatre, just so you can nudge your friend during the movie and point out a certain celebrity cameo, and also the explosions and action should warrant some big screen attention. Better than Step-Brothers and Pineapple Express.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Funny and entertaining take on movie making business,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Tropic Thunder"" (2008) was and still is a funny and mostly hilarious movie about hilarious place - Hollywood. It parodies many movies but mostly actors who are sometimes over do at their craft and takes that way to serious. There are references to some famous actors and one not so famous now producer name of which we won't mention here. As for the movie itself, i found very entertaining, funny, and very well paced. Actors did a great job, and not just Robert but the entire cast are on spot. But this is Ben Stiller's movie - he directs, writs and acts - and it all works.Overall, while not all jokes lands in ""Tropic Thunder"", most of them do and that what makes this movie work.

Blood And Guts And Agents,"Though the satire is heavy handed at times, there is still enough to get some really good laughs from Tropic Thunder, Ben Stiller and Justin Theroux's salute to blood and guts war films.I think Stiller and Theroux got their idea for this film from The Three Amigos. If you'll remember three Hollywood silent western stars are transported to Mexico which if you'll remember was in one anarchic state during the teen years of the last century.What we have here is a few actors who are doing a Vietnam War movie in Vietnam giving the director and producer all kinds of grief with their various hangups. What to do is set them down in total isolation in the jungle with cameras and explosive devices.Unfortunately that part of the jungle is now the turf of some nasty drug dealers who are intrepid actors have to do some real battle with. Especially after they capture one of them, Ben Stiller, and the ransom they demand from the producers ain't forthcoming.The best gag in the film is Tom Cruise and the hilarious portrayal he gives in an unbilled role. I can't say more because that is the whole point of the joke.Tropic Thunder could have stood some improvement, but I laughed pretty good in the theater. The film is also politically incorrect as all get out as you will discover in Robert Downey, Jr.'s part.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

If ever there were a movie that was probably a lot of fun to film, this was it.As to the criticism of Robert Downey Jr.'s character wearing black makeup, and Ben Stiller's character playing a developmentally disabled man - with the guys saying ""retard"" a lot - I think that was part of the satire.

15 Years Too Late and a Lot of Laughs Too Little,"I just saw Tropic Thunder. It wasn't bad, but it didn't live up to expectations. I can honestly say that I enjoyed Stiller's last directorial effort, Zoolander, much more than I did this flick. For me TT has two major flaws. Firstly, they couldn't decide whether they were filming a spoof or a satire--spoofs have jokes, satires have bitingly comic themes. Some of Stiller's jokes are goofy, laugh out loud surreal Zoolander-type stuff spoofing war movie clichés, but a lot of the movie is more like a social satire of the modern movie business, with characters behaving in non-joke ways to joke situations. And the two styles don't mix well in this movie. I think Still had way too much time to think about the screenplay over the years and was very, very interested in the story and characters, but couldn't resist sticking the cheap jokes in there as well--which take us as the audience out of the story and characters. Two styles in conflict. Secondly, the genre Stiller is using to spoof and as his springboard of satire, the Viet Nam War flick, is one that would have last been relevant to do a take on about 15 years ago. I mean, really--visual quotes from Platoon and Rambo? Those flicks aren't old enough for true iconic nostalgia and not current enough for most folks to really ""get"" the spoofing.Anyway, it's an OK picture. Not much more. Maybe a really skilled director could have done more with it, but Stiller is still more of a performer than a director.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"This movie is rated WAAAY too high, it's a stinker.  Walked out of theater.","My wife and I about 45 minutes in looked at each other with glazed over eyes and both realized we had lost any interest in wasting any more time watching this movie, got up and walked out.Tired, stale and 10 year old humor just didn't work. The cinematography and costumes and sets were amazing, but then they had this lame dialog, lame jokes, and gross-out violence. (C'mon, a guy holding up his blown off arms is never going to be funny, especially when we have a crappy president sending young men to their deaths or injury for real).Robert Downey Jr. at first was going to be awesome I thought, but then he never said a funny line. Never thought Jack Black should be in a movie, and nothing he does hear changes my mind.And then we have Ben Stiller, who since he had children has turned into one himself. Perhaps talking to 3 years olds has damaged his brain, and so he can only write humor that 3-10 year olds would find funny.Movies I have liked recently include Iron Man, The Dark Knight, Juno, Hellboy 2, and even Jumper and Wanted were at least entertaining.I put this movie at the bottom of the barrel, as I have only walked out on a few movies in my life...it's a stinker. I simply cannot understand the rave reviews or the ratings on IMDb or RottenTomatoes.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Lightning Unfortunately Never Really Strikes.,"An out of control parody of war films such as ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Platoon"" which also makes fun of contemporary Hollywood and everything within it. ""Tropic Thunder"" starts off high flying and dominant, but then fizzles quickly when it actually gets to the heart of its story. Actors Ben Stiller (also co-writer/director), Robert Downey, Jr., Jack Black, and others get thrown together in a would-be epic Vietnam flick, but their prima-donna ways lead to issues abound for their first time British director (Steve Coogan), their war veteran screenwriter (Nick Nolte), and a crazed movie mogul (an almost unrecognizable Tom Cruise as he is totally unbound) who funds the entire production. Thus the actors get thrown into an East Asian hotbed of international heroin production where the enemy has the tale-tell signs of 1970s Vietnam. Another one of those big budget summer would-be blockbusters which shows all its good points in the movie spots and cinematic trailers. The movie ends up being a long and tiring exercise accentuated by foul-mouthed characters and chaotic set pieces. Downey, Jr.'s transformation into an African-American is weird to say the least and Black's hidden narcotic addiction is supposed to be a funny side-story which ends up being annoying and completely unwanted. Just think ""The Three Amigos"" for the 2000s group who crave constant adult situations and mediocre outcomes. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,Comedy
"A meta-language comedy that perfectly executes its target, the Hollywood industry","""Tropical Thunder"" brings together a great cast to make a satire on Hollywood, a satire that is very well constructed and executed, criticizing all the stereotypes of actors, films and producers, the controversial 2008 feature directed by Ben Stiller that despite its silly tone he directs his film very well, with magnificent makeup and a photography and score that are inspired by films like ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Platon"" since the script tells the story of the production of a film, yes we have that metalanguage, about a great American war hero who participated in the vietnam war, and from that point on all the clichés are very well explored, the film has acid humor jokes, but that work as a tone of criticism of the industry itself, in addition the cast acts very well.

"Ben Stiller and company hit the comedic mark with ""TROPIC THUNDER.""","Advanced screening: Toronto (July 31, 2008) Tropic Thunder is a film I've anticipated (from it's trailers/ Downey Jr's ""Blackface"" controversy) for quite awhile, but knowing Ben Stiller's hit (Reality Bites) or miss (Zoolander) directing filmography, I kept my expectations relatively lukewarm. Luckily that wasn't necessary because it's Stiller's best effort as a director to date as well as one of the best comedies of the year.Starting with the best fake-trailers this side of Grindhouse, TROPIC THUNDER develops into the most uniquely wacky blend of satire/action/ and gross-out I've ever seen. At first it appears to be a straight-up spoof on popular war films, then it becomes a film within a film, then an attack on Hollywood and the film industry in general. Also present are some rather shocking (and hilarious) sight gags (exploding film-crew members, the brutal slaughter of an endangered species) that managed to catch everyone off guard (yet not offend them).The main reason TROPIC THUNDER works so well though is it's stellar ensemble cast. You have the likes of Ben Stiller, Robert Downey Jr, Jack Black, Jay Baruchel, Steve Coogan, and Nick Nolte all turning in terrific comedic performances that they obviously had fun with. Tom Cruise gives the extended cameo of the year as a studio executive, while Tobey Maguire and a slew of other actors make notable appearances. Ultimately it is Downey Jr. who steals almost every scene as the platoon's very white, African-American squad leader.Rude, witty, and ballsy, TROPIC THUNDER is a great time at the movies. It's hard finding worth-while large budget comedies these days, but DIRECTOR Ben Stiller, supported by a strong cast and a great premise, has proved himself to be the right man for the task. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Although like most comedies, the couple most funny parts were in the trailer.The casting in this movie is really the best part. Tom Cruise got a lot of my respect for him back. He was great. Robert Downey JR. was awesome, I'm glad he's acting again.

What really bothered me is that I just felt it all fell flat. It had it's tremendously funny moments, but as far as laugh out loud moments, they were few and far between.

They really need to cool down with movie trailers! Felt like I'd already seen the movie!,"Very amusing big budget comedy about a bunch of superstar actors who think they're making a movie when they're really lost in the jungle and being pursued by machine-gun wielding members of a drug cartel. Ben Stiller plays a huge action star trying to break into drama. Robert Downey Jr. plays a method actor who goes so deep into character that he doesn't break it until the DVD commentary. And Jack Black is a star of fart-themed movies who is addicted to heroin. I laughed a lot at Tropic Thunder, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd hoped I would. Part of it is that they've had so many previews and commercials for the movie, and they've been airing them since April or so, and I've pretty much seen the whole movie. But that might not really be the whole reason, because even the jokes that I hadn't seen - and there were plenty - weren't always making me laugh. And even when I was laughing, I never laughed big. And maybe it's because two other comedies released in the past month, Step Brothers and Pineapple Express, both made my sides split. Yes, even Step Brothers, as stupid as I will admit it was. While I would recommend those two even more, I would also say Tropic Thunder is well worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Very Compelling Comedy,"Ben Stiller and an All-Star cast delivered a very well put together comedy. Many are concerned about the ""Retard"" aspect in this movie. You can never please anyone, ever. There is always some troll who has a bottle up his *** and can't take a joke, but people are stupid people. Anyways, onto the movie, who gives a **** about trolls.The movie starts off as a spoof from Platoon (And you already know the scene), Stiller nails it. I laughed my *** off when he flailed his arms while falling down like in Platoon. This entire movie is spoofs of almost every war film ever made.Afterwords, they get sent to Vietnam in actual war soil, which they don't know is. With set up video cameras, explosives and armed Vietnamese soldiers. They start one of the greatest comedies of the decade.I highly recommend you watch this if you're into comedies.This is no Date, Epic, Scary, or Super Hero Movie ladies and gentlemen, this is gold.PS: I loved Jack Black's character.",,Anonymous,Comedy

It m-m-m-mmm-m-makes me happy.,"Although Tropic Thunder's humour, a mixture of clever satire and low-brow comedy, isn't always successful, with some of the gags falling rather flat, the ones that do work (and there are a lot of them) are so good that I'm willing to forgive the occasional dud.Star Ben Stiller (who also directs) plays yet another lovable imbecile, Hollywood action star Tugg Speedman, one of the cast of an epic, over-budget war movie who mistakenly become involved in a real battle against Golden Triangle heroin traffickers when their director Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan) tries to salvage his film by shooting guerrilla style deep in the jungles of Vietnam.Joining Tugg in the fight are co-stars Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.), who takes his craft so seriously he undergoes skin pigmentation surgery to play an African American, Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black), drug addled star of fart-centric comedy franchise The Fatties, rap star Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson), and newcomer Kevin Sandusky (Jay Baruchel).Exactly which bits tickle your funny bone the most will depend on your own particular sense of humour, but for me it was Stiller mistaking Cockburn's decapitated head for a studio prop, Simple Jack saying 'this head movie makes my eyes rain', the panda head-dress, and an almost unrecognisable Tom Cruise as foul mouthed, balding, power hungry, producer with all the right moves, Les Grossman.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Vietnam gets treated to a revisit by UFOs,"Ben Stillers effort at making a comedy about Vietnam is OK. It is a noble effort at moving comedy to a different dimension. Bringing Unidentified flying actors (UFA's) into the Vietnam War is kind of the basis of this film.The film opens with apparent previews of other movies done by the luminaries of the cast. Then it kicks straight into the Tropic Thunder movie set in Vietnam. In typical Hollywood fashion, the set is over budget and out of control. The movie then veers in the same direction.At 107 minutes, it is in the ideal length range of a comedy film. The difference is that there are moments where action dominates the comedy. There are moments where drama is attempted, With a cast like Jack Black, Nick Nolte & Robert Downey Jr along with Stiller, the film seems more comfortable doing funny stuff than drama.Luckily Stiller realizes this and leans more towards the humor. This movie is OK but would be better if it stuck even more to humor. Jack Black only gets a few sequences.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Best Comedy in Years!,"""Tropic Thunder is a film that understands biting satire. It sets out to villainize the very people that made the film possible. It understands parody and it understands good comedy and delivers consistent laughs throughout. It starts out with a promising bang and from there, continues to revel in its absurdity and wit. The script is sharp and provides a great basis for the humor that spurs the film on, however, it's truly the actors that take it to the next level. Robert Downey Jr's performance as the lost Australian actor is perhaps one of the most standout performances in a comedy. Not only that, but Tom Cruise's Les may just be the engine that brings this film home. Its both ridiculous and a furnace of hilarity. But in all truth, the chemistry within the rest of the cast is undeniable. I would have to caution viewers, this film may not be what you're expecting. Ben Stiller's previous films and even his own written ""Zoolander"" are quite different from the tone and the visuals of Tropic Thunder. And its not just in the profanity or utter gore, its within the concepts behind the film. It dares to go into areas that are politically incorrect and what say may even find on the offensive side. Its not afraid to traverse the areas outside of hands-off comedy. Like I said, this could be satire at is very best, and its got the cast and the laughs to prove it. If you're a fan of balls- to-wall, brazen comedy that isn't afraid of the lines, this will be your cup of tea. You'll be laughing from start to finish and reveling in the ride. It's fresh and that originality carries it somewhere great. There is a total lack of predictability and its shies away from the clichés and THAT is something I think a lot of films haven't been ballsy enough to do."" -another critic",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Full metal platoon apocalypse on the river Kwai,"From the previews, I expected something much funnier but it's funny enough in certain places. From the fake trailers to the big action opening sequence, it opens up with a bang only to dip down not along after the actors enter the real jungle. Call me sick but I liked the gross-out humour parts reminding me of Monty Python sometimes. I also liked the constant profanity. The best acting and funniest bits probably come from Tom Cruise disguised as an unrecognizable foul-mouthed movie producer. Robert Downey Jr playing the black sergeant manages to do quite well and is probably the coolest character so I doubt he'll offend black people even though he's white. The interactions between him and the real black guy could have been stronger and funnier though.Ben Stiller has some funny bits but the whole retarded Simple Jack routine wears thin really fast. Jack Black is the weakest link providing much manic energy but very little in terms of acting skill or actually funny comedy. He's the most caricatural one-dimensional and annoying of the bunch. I'm not a huge fan of war movies but even I caught a few references so war movie buffs should have a ball. So in the end, Tropic Thunder was hit and miss for me. Comedies making fun of war and primadonna self-involved actors are few and far between so if those subjects appeal to you, then a rental is worthwhile.Rating: 6 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Excellent satire, funny and witty as hell.","With ""Tropic Thunder"", star/director Ben Stiller and company turns the tables at Hollywood, making fun of it in almost every aspect. From the wily-minded executive to the desperate measures of stereotypic actors, this film has it all.Stiller and Black play their parts well and pull it off being funny at the same time, Stiller playing a stereotypic actor so desperate he went ""full retard"" on a film that almost sank his career; Black playing another stereotypic comedy actor whose basis is only on fart jokes, and so desperate he takes some you-know-what. But it works too.The main attractions, however, are Downey and Tom Cruise. Downey is remarkably hilarious in his role, the method actor Lazarus, playing as if he was born a black man. Cruise is also as excellent as the foul-mouthed Grossman, a somewhat sharp poke at The Weinstien Brothers. Really, it's all good.The film is mostly filled with satirical jokes that are all spot-on. From the starting fake trailers we have a rap star promoting consumerism, an action hero in way too many sequels, a gross-out comedy that appeals to today's audience, and a highly potentially controversial art film. Nothing is spared as Stiller and company proceed to jab at all of Hollywood and movie-making's faults, and their proud of it. The dialogue is sharp tongued and hilarious.So, if you are looking for a funny film with a sharp satirical message, you must watch this film. It is exceptionally funny and shows us the ugly, somewhat true side of Hollywood at it's worst.Overall value: 9/10",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Really one of the best and most original comedies of this decade,","Modern comedies are starting to get a bit tiresome and it's often simply too much of the same. ""Tropic Thunder"" really is not like that and takes an original approach to the genre, with a great original story and a dream-team of actors.Ben Stiller movies are often too much Ben Stiller movies, which means that the movies focus and rely too much on him. Not that he's bad, on the contrary really but it's also a bit tiresome, especially now days, when he appears in in the main role in comedies, two times a year, or so. Thank goodness that in this movie he is being supported by some truly fine actors, of which some of them really aren't that likely that appear in a comedy. I'm of course talking about Robert Downey Jr., who simply is just brilliant in this movie. It wasn't just for nothing that he received an Oscar nomination for his role in this movie. He really deserved it. Also unexpectedly great is Tom Cruise. He once proofs to be more than just a great actor, who can handle different genres easily. The movie further more stars fine actors such as Jack Black, Nick Nolte and Matthew McConaughey.It's a movie that's simply greatly being written and directed. It more picks the approach of a serious big multi-million Hollywood production, which enhances the movie being an Hollywood-satire even more. If you're a bit familiar with movie-making and everything surrounding it you'll find the movie to be even more funny and amusing that the average person.It's also not a lame comedy, with lame jokes and such but it's actually a quite clever movie, that is greatly written. It's not a comedy that constantly tries to make you laugh but it's being more subtle with its humor but yet not without it's typical modern comedy touches to it. Some people might find this movie to be less funny than if got advertised as but its humor is simply just more in its little things and the pompous and over-the-top way this movie got made in. With it's $92,000,000 budget this was quite a daring project, that in the end more than paid off.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Worst so-called Comedy I have ever seen... Terrible Movie, that just isn't funny.","I saw this film yesterday in a special preview screening and was shocked at how rubbish it was. It was probably the most unfunniest comedy I have ever seen and the entire audience didn't laugh either for most of the movie - no joke.The jokes were totally lame, pre-school and badly written. The acting was actually terrible too (despite having so many celebrities in it).The worst thing by far however, was the script - what on earth was Ben Stiller smoking when he wrote this??? It was just dire and painful to watch. It was devoid of any talent whatsoever - I cannot believe that Ben Stiller of all people, could have written something so completely unfunny. I actually used to think highly of Ben Stiller (he was brilliant in Meet the Parents) - not any more I can tell you. Even Steve Coogan was made completely unfunny in this movie, and he's normally hilarious.I find it laughable that this film is being touted as amazingly funny by the media and destined for awards. It seems that a movie can be terrible, badly written, unfunny, completely talentless and still get praised highly only because of the A-list cast being in it.A lot of the scenes were also very offensive to certain groups of people and totally unnecessary. Avoid this movie if you have sense or any intelligence whatsoever - have never left a cinema feeling so empty and unimpressed before.

Pointless and Disappointing,"Tropic Thunder is a movie that I felt very disappointed and confused. I saw the good reviews on IMDb and other places and thought it was going to be that great yet when I saw it, it was kinda boring and unfunny. I'm gonna disagree with the majority and say that Tropic Thunder had a couple of chuckles, but was overall a rather dull comedy and a not very funny action film. I felt that the actors were mugging for the camera and the cheap shots at Hollywood were so far removed from reality that most of the satire fell flat.The characters weren't that bad but really not that great either. Consider the Robert Downey Jr character. Downey did as good a job as anyone could in that role, but the role itself was not funny past the first second we see him. It was basically the same joke told throughout the film and it was only slightly amusing the first time. I'm not sure if African Americans were offended by the role, but I wouldn't be surprised because the character is not making any satirical comment that relates to anything in reality. Its just a white guy acting like a black guy. And he did it pretty wrong. Honestly they should have either gotten a black actor for that role or just make Downey Jr. without the makeup (not looking like a black male). The treatment of retarded people was also offensive, in my opinion, as was the treatment of Vietnamese people. And the ending was very predictable and not funny. As a rewatch 04.27.17' this film is not as bad as initially thought as for the comedy is mostly hit or miss. It is well with the chemistry of the lead characters, and the fake trailers and stories the film makes ensuring given the leads a backstory is well done.

The movie they think they're making... isn't a movie anymore.,"Tropic Thunder is a 2008 action comedy film directed by Ben Stiller and starring Stiller, Jack Black and Robert Downey Jr. as a group of prima donna actors filming a Vietnam War film when their fed-up writer-director decides to abandon them in the middle of the jungle, forcing them to fight their way out.What I expected from this movie was to have a good time laughing my ass off. Fortunately, it's funnier than most comedies I've seen in quite awhile. I didn't even find ""Superbad"" as funny as people made it out to be. Maybe I don't laugh as much as normal people. Unfortunately, the film didn't exceed my expectations. I expected more laughs but what can you expect? I'm just a non-laughable person.But who cares if I didn't laugh as much as I expected to. I actually laughed, which must count for an accomplishment the film did. The beginning of the film starts off with faux trailers, like the ones shown during ""Grindhouse,"" so don't worry if you're not seeing the movie, even though you are seeing it. It just gives you what movies the protagonists are in.Most of the laughs are close to the beginning and end and a little in the middle. The movie works as an action movie and a comedy, each actor seeming to have a fun time in their roles. I also like the fact that this movie has a lot of cameos (and when I say a lot, there is a lot) but I won't surprise you, even though there is one apparent name that is sticking out to you already.Well, if you don't already know, I won't say it but if you do, you must know that after people see this movie, people would start to respect him as an actor, even though I never lost respect for this man. People will start to see him as a cool man. Like Morgan Freeman in ""Wanted,"" you'll hear and see things that this man has never done before and it's quite funny because his performance is so over-the-top.It's not only him that may be the highlight of the movie, so the other is obviously Robert Downey Jr. How is he? He's very good and funny but all of you should know that by now. Everyone else in the movie also give off a few laughs, although the first two actors I've mentioned are probably the most memorable.With some decent action scenes and very funny scenes, ""Tropic Thunder"" is the comedy to see this summer. One of the reason might be because of the cameos and over-the-top performances in here. Another is that this film actually made me laugh, which is an incredible feat for comedies to accomplish this year. For those reasons, I think it's a worthy admission to see it in theaters.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The dialogue is hilarious and the acting is fine, with Downey turning in a particularly good performance. This movie is funny, if not hilarious, throughout. The trailers in the beginning (one of the funniest parts) felt like a great tribute to Grindhouse, rather than a rip-off. Nick Nolte, an almost unrecognizable Tom Cruise, and Mathew McConaughey are all funny in their supporting roles My only complaints with the movie are that Ben Stiller plays the same character he always does and Nick Nolte was underused.Definitely a film all comedy or war fans should go see.

In fact, the most fun to be had is with the ""trailers"" of coming attractions that starts the show. These are short, humorous takes on the portentous trailers of portentous Hollywood movies.As for the movie itself: Very funny scenes pop up throughout, yet things get boring because the whole thing is never really more than a parody -- there's nothing remotely real about the story or characters. Downey is absolutely fantastic; the other actors, competent, but never anything more than a foil for his abilities. Stiller gets old and annoying in many of his scenes, but hats off to him for attempting something above a Will Ferrell comedy. There is something really sublime in the way Downey's argument with the real black actor points out the posturing involved in all racial stereotyping -- including that done by the ""stereotypes"" themselves.Best enjoyed as a DVD, or Tivo-ed, where the annoying POW scenes can be FF-ed through and the bits with Downey enjoyed.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Definitely one to repair the somewhat tarnished image of the past few years. Stiller is his usual self but is overshadowed by Black and Downey Jr. not surprising given the multiple roles he played behind the scenes. Wall to wall cameos, particularly at the end (blink and you'll miss them) and I really won't tell you which the funniest cameo was as that may spoil this gem of a joke....provided you catch it that is! highly recommended movie - I will definitely be heading out to see it when it comes out for general audiences!",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"""Tropic Thunder"" is satire of powerful and shallow Westerners--not racially stereotypical","Having just seen ""Tropic Thunder,"" I'm surprised at the notion that it was crafted with a bias against African-Americans or Asians. In fact, it's aimed at the pretensions of a certain class of powerful and shallow people in American cinema. They've been lampooned before--the schmoozing agent, the crude type-A studio exec, the intellectual dilettante actor. This movie effectively sets 'em up and plows 'em down.In ""Tropic Thunder,"" all of these characters are white, and are portrayed by white people. Robert Downey, Jr.'s Australian actor, a five-time Oscar winner who specializes in ""arty"" films, is the white-masquerading-as-black. The script makes him look like a fool at the hands of the film's one major genuine African-American character (one of the two level-headed major characters in the film), while hosing the sorts of bad token roles that African-American actors tend to get in films like this. In the end, as part of the serio-comic growth in the film's characters, Downey's actor discards his lame disguise and embraces his, uh, Australian-ness.As to the Burmese in this movie, they're mainly foils. They're depicted as competent warriors (as opposed to the Hollywood poseurs). The one ridiculous aspect is their respect for Ben Stiller's character's lousy work as a mentally disabled man in a previous flop film--which is par for the course in a ribald spoof like this. The few Vietnamese in the film are hotel workers who are saddled with Hollywood prima donnas and drunken Western package tourists.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Ridiculous Concept That Works,"This is up there as one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Maybe it hasn't aged as great as other comedies, but I haven't had an issue with the material, and I feel like it's just as hilarious today as it was back then. Downey Jr. Playing a fake actor playing a black dude is genius comedy and shouldn't work like it does but in the end, comedy is meant to push boundaries. I thought the whole cast in general was hysterical. The fake trailers at the beginning made me believe they were real the first time I saw them. I wish they would return to making comedies like this again. It's okay to offend sometimes in my opinion and the audience will let you know when you've gone too far anyway. Our society needs comedic relief to heal. 4.5/5 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Ben Stiller Pulls It Off,"Twenty years ago, ""Tropic Thunder"" would have been too much of an insider comedy, accessible only to the most knowledgeable of Hollywood devotees. But as writer/director/star Ben Stiller has pointed out in interviews, nowadays everyone's an insider. The inner workings of show business are displayed on the Internet for the whole world to see. Savvy movie fans know about Oscar campaigns and tyrannical studio bosses and self-absorbed actors, and a movie like ""Tropic Thunder"" -- which hacks Hollywood to pieces more astutely, mercilessly, and hilariously than any satire in at least a decade -- can emerge as one of the year's best comedies without going over everyone's heads.It begins with fake trailers introducing us to the fake actors in the movie. Tugg Speedman (Stiller) is an action hero who recently made an ill-advised grab for Oscar glory by playing a mentally handicapped man in ""Simple Jack"" (think Sean Penn in ""I Am Sam""). Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black) is known for his flatulent family comedies in which he plays all the roles (think Eddie Murphy in everything), though his personal life is a heroin-flavored mess. And Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.) is a five-time-Oscar-winning Method actor known for fully immersing himself in his characters. ""I don't read the script, the script reads me"" is one of the pretentious, nonsensical things he likes to say.These three Hollywood airheads are the stars of a big-budget Vietnam epic being directed by Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan), who quickly finds that their egos and pampered lifestyles are interfering with the production. (We're told that the film is ""one month behind schedule after only five days of shooting."") The studio head, Les Grossman (Tom Cruise), a vulgar despot with hairy arms and a gold chain around his neck, is furious, demanding that Damien get the film back on track or heads will roll.As it happens, Four Leaf Tayback (Nick Nolte), the battle-scarred Vietnam veteran whose memoirs the film is being based on, is on the set as a consultant, and he has an idea for Damien: Drop the actors into a real Vietnamese jungle, with no cell phones or other comforts, and shoot the movie with cameras hidden in the trees. The Hollywood phonies' reactions to all the deprivations of war will seem a lot more real, and the actors will be forced to focus on their work.Did you guess that once they've been put in the jungle, the stars encounter actual bad guys who they think are fellow actors? And that they're surprised when the villains seem to be firing actual bullets? Yes, that's the initial concept, but thankfully it isn't long before the reality of the situation becomes obvious to them and the film shifts to its new direction: the actors have to rescue Tugg from an Asian heroin factory run by a ruthless teenage warlord (Brandon Soo Hoo).""Tropic Thunder"" (that's the name of the Vietnam drama they're making, too) is packed with ingenious running jokes skewering the behind-the-scenes stories that movie fans know so well. Tugg Speedman is a well-meaning but vain idiot (an area of expertise for Stiller), while Jeff Portnoy is suffering from heroin withdrawal during much of their jungle trek. Kirk Lazarus, the Method actor, is playing an African American soldier, so he has had his skin chemically darkened -- which means, yes, Robert Downey Jr. is in black-face for most of the film. And not just black-face, but black-voice, too, because Kirk Lazarus never breaks character. Heightening the tension is the fact that there's an actual black guy in the movie with them, a rapper-turned-entrepreneur named Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson) who's trying to break into acting. You may rest assured that he and Kirk Lazarus have some conversations about race.The fifth member of their team is an eager young actor named Kevin Sandusky (Jay Baruchel). Without a gimmick, this character appears to be superfluous, until you realize it's his normalcy that makes him important -- he's the straight man surrounded by crazies. Stiller and his co-writers, Etan Cohen (TV's ""King of the Hill"") and actor Justin Theroux, know comedy well enough to appreciate the importance of such a character in a loopy scenario like this one.All of the supporting characters are fantastic, too (up-and-comer Danny R. McBride scores again as the production's pyrotechnics expert), and the casting is perfect. Nick Nolte as a grizzled veteran who sleeps in a tent (""Beds give me nightmares)? Matthew McConaughey as Tugg's tooly agent Rick Peck, who calls everybody by nicknames, including himself (""the Pecker"")? And Tom Cruise as the terrifyingly foul-mouthed studio head? Genius, sheer genius -- especially for Cruise, who might wipe away all the negative impressions people have had of him over the last three years with this single performance.This is the first film Stiller has directed since 2001's ""Zoolander."" He's acted in some bad comedies since then, but ""Tropic Thunder"" is proof that he hasn't lost his edge, neither as a filmmaker (he's impressively disciplined here) nor as a performer. It's no surprise that Stiller, the son of Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara and a Tinseltown insider since birth, should have such keen insight into the vanities of Hollywood. His short-lived sketch series, ""The Ben Stiller Show,"" had glimpses of it. ""Tropic Thunder"" feels like it represents everything he and Downey and Black have learned in their years of making movies -- and it shows that they're self-aware enough to realize how silly the whole profession is.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Even though it's not bad, but it's not like you want to watch it in one sitting. It took me 2 sittings to finish this movie. Also, I've heard that this movie has really cool quotes, but I was watching it in Russian dub and I guess it didn't transfer all of it there.

Fun in the Sun,"To give due credit, Tropic Thunder is reaching for the stars. It tries to satirize as much of the movie business and the Vietnam-War-film genre as it can. There are high points, such as Robert Downey Jr.'s method actor Kirk Lazarus being so wedded to the character that he can't break free -- even when it has become clearly obvious that they are no longer filming a movie -- or Matthew McConaughey's super agent Rick Peck and his obsession with TiVo. I won't mention Tom Cruise's guest role as a foul-mouthed, iron-fisted dictatorial studio head other than to wonder loudly how things are going over at United Artists.Why then did I feel so unsatisfied with the movie? I liked it. I enjoyed and laughed heartily through most of the jokes. It was as if the individual jokes were all greater than the sum -- a collection of funny punch lines that are a pastiche of laughs but not a satisfyingly funny routine. Part of it is the unwieldy blending of high-concept satire and lowbrow profanity-laced rants. Swearing can be used to high effect and it plays to perfection at times in Tropic Thunder. The best example (and my favorite line from the film) is from Robert Downey Jr. who, after being asked what kind of farm he works on, mows down the bad guys with his gun and declares that ""I'm a lead farmer, mother--"" well, you see where I'm going. Initially, Tom Cruise's profanity-ridden rants are funny too. But then you realize that there isn't anything else to the character. His character, Les Grossman, just throws tantrums and screams profanities, a paper-thin joke that works through audacity but wears out after the first rant. After a while the swearing starts to sound like a group of little kids who've just heard their first bad words and think it is funny to yell them over and over again.On the other hand, I loved the performances. Jack Black's focused insanity was pointed in the right direction and he got a great part that he's well-suited to. Stiller manages to play Tugg Speedman with enough vulnerability that you can buy his need for the fictional movie to be a big hit. The scenes from his critical bomb Simple Jack are priceless, as are Downey's explanation of why Speedman would never have won an Oscar for it. Nick Nolte (good to see him again) has a strong supporting part, as does Steve Coogan as the overwhelmed first-time director. The picture is Downey's, though, and wherever Redd Foxx is, I think he would be proud. Scene-stealing, scenery-chewing and utterly priceless, Downey looks like he's enjoying every minute on screen. If you see Tropic Thunder for any reason, watching Robert Downey Jr. should be it.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Ben Stiller really nailed it with this one.What I loved most was how it poked fun at Hollywood's crazy obsession with method acting and overflowing narcissism. It's like they took the craziness of 2000s comedy and cranked it up to eleven. You've got Robert Downey Jr. Going full method as a dude playing a dude disguised as another dude - that's some next-level comedy right there.The production was top-notch, with action-packed scenes and hilarious moments seamlessly blending together. Unfortunately, it would not fly in today's political climate. The movie goes all-in on the humor, and some might find it a bit too much or inappropriate by today's standards.Still, if you can put that aside and just enjoy the absurdity, ""Tropic Thunder"" is a classic comedy that had me in stitches.

"Well, I Laughed Anyway","Ben Stiller as an actor annoys me. He's too one-note and often shallow, making a poor fit for the derivative concept movies Ben Stiller the scenarist devises. Fortunately, Ben Stiller the director seems to have enough talent and good comic sense to bail the other Bens out sometimes.Such a film is ""Tropic Thunder.""Tugg Speedman (Stiller) leads a cast of coddled stars acting in a Vietnam war movie who have run their production a month behind schedule...in just the first week. Director Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan), facing dismissal, opts to plant his actors directly in the jungle, away from their handlers and expensive distractions. Everything, of course, goes wrong.What exactly goes wrong is something I don't want to spoil, except to say that viewers of ""Galaxy Quest"" and ""Three Amigos"" will recognize the situation. It's neither original or freshly delivered, though the fate of the frantic Cockburn did surprise me. As is the case with other Stiller films I've seen, we get a plot that exists only as a minimal structure for laugh lines and sight gags. Judd Apatow and Adam McKay make the same kind of comedies, but they seem to go for more audience engagement and character development than I see Stiller doing.Stiller's strength is that he's a funny guy, and, in this movie, does a solid job developing an ensemble feel with his fellow actors. Robert Downey Jr. got most of the notice (and an Oscar nomination) as Australian method actor Kirk Lazarus who opts to play an African- American with the help of a special operation that amounts to blackface. He's so committed to his part he vows not to break character ""until the DVD commentary.""Actually, in reality Downey didn't even do that until the commentary was nearly over. He presents a very funny character who talks entirely with lines lifted from a 1970s Blaxploitation thriller, like ""Ain't nothing but a thang."" He takes offense when someone says ""you people"" to him, meaning of course annoying method actors.""What do you mean, YOU PEOPLE!"" he demands, eyes glaring.""What do YOU mean, you people!"" asks the one actor on set who really is black, Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson).The back and forth between these guys is really well delivered, with Jack Black getting in some fine lines and reaction shots as the strung- out star of a series of obnoxious fatty ""Klumps""-style comedies. There are some first-rate bits throughout, particularly an over-the-top opening action scene where the ample bloodletting is played for laughs and a discussion between Kirk and Tugg about the merits of not going ""full retard"" when assaying a mentally challenged role.This, like Kirk's racial identity issues, could have stuck Stiller in Mel Gibson Land but instead comes off as successful satire. It's really the dog-eared story and Stiller's struggle to justify his star billing with a Derek Zoolander retread that make ""Tropic Thunder"" just a fun time-waster rather than an absurdist comedy to remember. You will laugh, but you may not remember a thing about this film a week later.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Ben Stiller, Jack Black and Robert Downey Jr headline a memorable satirical action comedy.","Tropic Thunder is still an excellent satirical action comedy over 15 years later. Ben Stiller who also directed the movie, Jack Black and Robert Downey Jr. Headline an all star cast including Steven Coogan, Jay Baruchel, Brandon T Jackson, Nick Nolte, Danny McBride, Matthew McConaughey, Bill Hader and Tom Cruise.Washed up action star Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller), drug addicted comedian Jeff Portnoy, and controversial Australian method actor Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr. Who was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor) headline the Vietnam War movie Tropic Thunder which is plagued by an inexperienced director Damien Cockburn (Steven Coogan) who is unable to control the prima donna attitudes of the actors as well as going overbudget and behind schedule. The foul mouthed and bad tempered studio head Les Grossman (Tom Cruise) gives Damien Cockburn an ultimatum, get the actors and movie under control and back on schedule or face having his movie cancelled. Former Vietnam Veteran Four Leaf Tayback (Nick Nolte) whom is the original author of which the movie is based on his memoirs, suggests dropping the actors in the middle of the jungle in Thailand and shooting the movie guerrilla style with weapons loaded with blanks and hidden explosives as well as a map to help find their way around. Alongside newcomer Kevin Sandusky (Jay Baruchel) and closeted homosexual rapper Alpa Chino (Brandon T Jackson), it forms as another way of the actors putting their inflated egos aside to find a way to work together. Unbeknownst to the actors, they are actually dropped into the middle of a drug war led by the Flaming Dragons. Tugg Speedman is kidnapped and held prisoner, having to re-enact his role as Simple Jack where he played a mentally handicapped character in a movie which was a box office flops and he received a lot of negative criticism. The actors try to figure out how to rescue Tugg and to make it out alive.Ben Stiller was great as Tugg Speedman and the director of the movie. He based his experiences from the various actors he worked with who were involved in various 80's movies about the Vietnam War including Platoon, Full Metal Jacket and Hamburger Hill who had returned from a mock boot camp to get a feeling of being in war. Jack Black had a memorable role as the comedic actor who often appeared in movies that relied on toilet humour and wanted to depart from those roles. Robert Downey Jr attracted a lot of controversy for his role as Australian method actor Kirk Lazarus who underwent pigmentation alteration surgery to temporarily darken his skin for his portrayal of his African American character. Kirk Lazarus in true method acting style refuses to break character until he records the DVD commentary. To be honest I wasn't expecting Robert Downey Jr to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, although the late Heath Ledger posthumously won for his role as The Joker in The Dark Knight (2008). Aside from the rest of the all star cast, Tom Cruise was memorable in a complete departure from his usual charismatic roles as the profanity laced, bad tempered, balding and overweight studio head Les Grossman. Tom Cruise didn't receive top billing and kept out of the publicity, but his name appeared at the end of the name credits.Tropic Thunder is still a memorable comedy however has been hampered by protests and controversy due to its depiction of handicapped characters and the depiction of blackface. Actor/Director Ben Stiller has stood by his defence saying that as a satirical comedy he has nothing to apologise for.I first watched Tropic Thunder in the cinema during my travels across the USA in 2008 and I had the pleasure of watching the movie in New York. The audience applauded at the end of Tropic Thunder and as an Australian, it was a new experience for me and it was great to be a part of that. Tropic Thunder is still a popular, witty and funny movie years later.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
What is it good for? absolutely nothing!,"Surrounded in controversy about whether it's racist, Downey Jnr Blacking up, or offensive to the disabled, the over use of the word retard and much more let me say that really none of that matters because this film just isn't funny. It tries so hard to pastiche the Hollywood of now and films like Platoon and Apocalypse Now but fails miserably. The trouble is that despite filling it with stars, Black, Coogan, Stiller, Cruise, Nolte et al they forgot to fill it with jokes and any they did put in are puerile and akin to the level of a Farley Brothers gross out, which meant that I only laughed once and that was more of a stifled guffaw than a laugh out loud. Tom Cruise only seems to be in the film to swear and do a silly dance which considering he does that now on every show he goes on to promote anything just seems stale. The story if you can call it that is so loose it almost falls off, the saving grace is the music which is what you'd expect from a Vietnam movie all Rolling Stones and Buffalo Springfield. Ultimately this has all been done before better and after a great opening few minutes it goes rapidly down hill and never recovers making this a sorry example of a comedy film and a waste of good actors.

The film also had a lot of brilliant and funny scenes scattered throughout, but they were rare, and ultimately the film was a huge disappointment. I got the satire, but I expected a more effective execution of it, and the parody as well. What I got was a surprisingly pretty mainstream comedy with a lot of action in it. The first half at least felt somewhat entertaining. The 2nd half lost me completely. I was just waiting for it to end. It was that dull. Downey Jr. of course held up many scenes, but there's so much he could do. I hated Jack Black in it as always, and Tom Cruise was not nearly as funny as some people (including himself) make out his scenes to be. Overall, a heavy disappointment, and pretty mediocre when it comes down to it. Why can't more comedies (which I am not a huge fan of) explore and dwelve into more complex events, like for example the far superior and deeply underrated Observe and Report? I do want to say that I really liked the final 5 minutes though.",,Anonymous,Comedy

Or to put it in a different way, this movie is just too damn long. Robert Downey Jr. is hilarious in the first hour, but then you've pretty much seen it. Ben Stiller and Jack Black, same thing. The movie doesn't really have that many jokes, it just thrives on its outrageous atmosphere that you've guessed it, fades after an hour or so.

A Good Spoof Movie,"Because Hollywood sometimes (or often) comes across as far too full of itself, I have always enjoyed the so-called ""spoof"" movies, when Hollywood engages in a bit of self-deprecating humour about how silly the whole business can sometimes be. I didn't think that ""Tropic Thunder"" was the best spoof movie I've ever seen, but it was pretty good and it did point out some of Hollywood's excesses. Actually, that happened right from the start when we were given a series of fake ""trailers"" and ""previews"" of movies that starred the actors who were in the fictional ""Tropic Thunder."" I especially enjoyed the trailer for ""Scorcher VI,"" starring Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller). How did it go? ""He made a difference five times before. Now he's going to make a difference again. But this time it will be different!"" So the movie caught my attention right from the start. The actual story revolves around a collection of stars shooting a movie about the Vietnam War. Convinced that they're not giving it their all, the decision is made to drop the whole bunch of them into the jungle to let them get the feel of the place. It's sort of ""Celebrity Survivor Extreme!"" Into the mix comes a drug ring led by a Vietnamese kid who thinks the actors are DEA agents and sets out to eliminate them, but it takes a while for the stars to actually realize this is happening for real.In all honesty, the movie wasn't hilarious. Amusing is probably more the word I would use for it. Stiller was good, as was Jack Black as ""Jeff Portnoy,"" but the real gem here was an over the top performance from Robert Downey, Jr as Australian actor and 5 time Oscar winner Kirk Lazarus, who is nevertheless so desperate for a part that he undergoes pigment alteration surgery to become a black man. In the words of actor Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson): ""they had one good part in here for a black man and they gave it to Crocodile Dundee!"" Downey was superb here in a complicated part: after all, he wasn't a white man playing a black man, he was a white man playing a white man playing a black man! There's a lot of good fun contained in this movie. It may not be the greatest ""spoof"" movie ever made, but it's still a pretty good one. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

In general it's a great satire and has multiple iconic scenes as a result of some great directing and a fantastic cast.That said. Downey Jr. Only really meant iron-man/avengers to me and he's fine for those roles. But he steals this movie. He's simply delivering the best lines and shows some real comedic strength. Whilst everyone else was fine, except Tom Cruise as well, what a performance. Just a stacked cast. What makes this movie so much fun is seeing these more serious actors in roles you'd typically not see them, and it adds to the absurdity of the satire.Directing, strong as expected, Stiller has shown to be a very competent director and it shows again here with some great pacing and his trademark type of silly humor.Acting and characters, as said, all great.

Give it a chance I guess,"I don't think I've ever seen a film that could offend so many people...and yet has so many good reasons for it to not be offensive.This film is kind of an enigma, it has so many of the tropes from other 2000s comedies, some of which you probably shouldn't do nowadays, but I also feel like it's savvy enough to peek a bit into the following decade and at the very least, try to make its offensive stuff palatable.I guess the elephant in the room is Robert Downey Jr. Being in blackface for nearly all of this film, and I know that some black people are okay with it and some aren't, and I wouldn't say that either of them are wrong, but honestly, I can only imagine you'd need to have half a brain to watch this film and come away from it thinking ""oh I guess blackface is okay for me to do then"". To me it seems like there was a reason for doing it that justified it while being a pretty funny dig at pretentious actors who think they can play any role, and it feels like a case of no harm, no foul.Anyway, I feel like that had to be addressed before anything else, so now I can mention how brilliant those performances are.Seriously, almost everyone in this film really brings their A-game to it, and I wasn't expecting that at all. I mean to be fair, I wasn't really expecting to like it at all, but holy god do the performances really elevate this film. Ben Stiller is surprisingly believable as a grizzled action movie star, Robert Downey Jr. Slips into a character within a character perfectly, and Jack Black...gets a little bit annoying towards the end, but he's also just crazy enough to keep a level of zanyness going.Everyone else is far better than they have any right to be considering this is a 2000s comedy with an all-star cast, so I won't go through them all, but none of them feel like they're just here for the paycheck.And even better, I found it genuinely funny and really smart with how it tears Hollywood a new pipe and then some, because of some really great writing and creative ideas going on here. A really good parody film is probably a damn hard thing to pull off, and it was just about the last thing I expected from a film made at this time, with this cast, but they did it.It's well paced, has funny dialogue, entertaining characters, really good production design, so I guess it only has one real fatal flaw for me.Which is that I didn't find it all that impressively directed. I feel like this probably applies to every parody movie ever made, but I would give my left unit to see Edgar Wright direct this. A more subjective complaint is that I feel like it gets a bit exhausting towards the end, because this is a very in-your-face film, without much of a break from that, and I found it a bit tiring by the last half an hour or so.But overall, I'm honestly pretty stunned by how good this actually is, and you shouldn't dismiss it like I was expecting to.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Not the full-lark though still earns a chuckle,"Irreverent tale of movie stars who are dropped in the middle of Vietnam thinking they'll be covertly filmed to promote realism in their next feature, when they discover they are really being hunted by local rebels. Stiller is the bone-headed leading man, Downey Jnr a face-painted African-American impersonator, Jack Black a cocaine-snorting bowl hair-styled actor whose fictitious credits include copious 'fart-joke' films (perhaps a poke at ""Norbit""). Each of them is on a journey to discover their inner thespian and learn to become more humble in the face of adversity, so goes the film's message.There's some raucously funny moments (Tobey MaGuire's cameo is a side-splitter), but equally, there's a number of misfires and subtlety isn't an adjective you could use to describe Stiller's sledge-hammer style. Tom Cruise's cameo morphs into a self-indulgent supporting role that seriously tests the patience, while by contrast, Steve Coogan's role as a frustrated director, at his wits end dealing with prima donnas, is tragically brief.Site gags and puerile dialogue aside, the film's core joke and running gags on racism and intellectual disability will either strike a chord, or offend, depending on your moral barometer. If you don't take it too seriously, though it's occasionally hit and miss and probably fifteen minutes overlong, you should still be entertained.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Worst so called comedy ever,"When I heard that someone is trying to make a Nam comedy movie, I just told myself, well this gotta be a real challenge, firstly because making a comedy about a war seems in the first place a bit weird and secondly because most of the people that actually lived the hell in Asia back then are still alive. Trying to make a circus out of the suffering and sorrow many Americans lived then is outrageously a shame. After I finished watching the movie, I realized that my worst fears came true. I haven't probably seen a worse so called comedy ever. Despite the fact that I really like Ben Stiller and maybe I saw most of his films, I don't recommend anyone to spend the money on this crap. A totally waste of time and money. The films basically wants to be a parody of great Nam movies like Platoon or action movie like Rambo but actually all it gets to be is a cheep circus. It fails lamentably in a 2 penny circus movie, maybe not good enough for small retarded children. Full of trivial language, sometimes it looks more like something forced to look more like the bad language they used to have those days in the war. In the end I am deeply sorry I had to spend one hour and something out of my weekend, to see, how a bunch of, otherwise good actors make ashame of themselves. If you wanna see a nice comedy, maybe you should just look for something else.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I thought especially Robert Downey Jr, Tom Cruise, Ben Stiller, Matthew McConaughey and Jack Black was really good and the movie was very funny. Every character had their own background story that each one of them actually were interesting and hilarious. But the funniest thing about this movie in my opinion was the way they joked about Hollywood, both actors and movies. And even the Academy Awards.

Smart Satire,"Believe it or not Ben Stiller was once very funny"" That's right Theo . In one film with Cameron Diaz ""You've just given away the punchline so shut up and don't interrupt again . But that sums up Stiller . THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY is a double edged sword . Even for someone like myself who is not keen on the comedy genre that film was exceptionally brilliant and for years afterwards everyone looked forward to seeing Stiller in a film that if it was a fraction as funny as THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY would still have been a classic comedy . Sadly it didn't happen and by the time TROPIC THUNDER came out audiences had given up on Stiller . This is a great pity because TT is a scathing satire on Hollywood and anyone who classes themselves as a movie fan will love thisIt hits the ground running and we're treated to some smart spoof trailers and the film continues in the same vein where Hollywood is making a Vietnam war epic and the over wrought nature of it is matched by the fact it's over budget and well behind schedule and this is the least of the problems as the cast of method actors are about to be kidnapped by violent bandits .There's somethings that are recognisable to the satire . Obviously this mock film owes direct references to APOCALYPSE NOW and PLATOON but they go a bit deeper than this . I take it Kirk Lazerus is a hybrid of Russell Crowe and Daniel Day Lewis while substance abuser Jeff Portnoy is inspired by Philip Seymour Hoffman ( Which wouldn't have been evident at the time ) while Stiller's character one time movie Idol whose stardom has almost disappeared might be a direct nod to Tom Cruise . Actually the one possible failing of the film is Cruise in the role of Leo Grossman , the cynical and ruthless studio head . Cruise doesn't do cynical or ruthless and he fails to convince as a heartless philistine anymore than he convinces that's bald and short sighted . This is a small failing and rightfully the film concentrates on the dilemma faced by a mob of method actors stuck in a dangerous situation",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Not offensive, not racist ....just stupid","I remain a Ben Stiller fan, but this movie ranks right up there among the most stupid movies I have ever seen. There were a few funny parts and a few good lines. The caliber of the acting line-up was pretty good, and the character development, even the characters that were superfluous to the story line, was pretty good. The language was a little over the top, even considering that it was an attempt to keep the tone in line with the characters that were being portrayed. I would be surprised if the sort of person who would consider going to see a movie like this would find it offensive.

"Best Satire, hilarious!","This is one of the best comedies I've ever seen, couldn't believe what I just saw, will certainly go down in history as one of the best Satire movies ever made. If I have to put it in a sentence it's a movie like The Expendables but got it right.The story is about a movie where many great actors such as Action Hero one(Typical Rambo), a method actor guy, a rapper, a TV actor, and an upcoming actor star in it. The Producer urges the director to not make it a flop given the budget, so the director decides to make a movie in a more realistic way and this gives us our movie. Every scene in this movie is hilarious and relatable, this movie has got all the elements that make us laugh, had a great story, and ended well.Ben Stiller along with Justin Theroux wrote this wonderful movie, this may be the best Ben Stiller movie as an actor and a director. With this rich set of the cast with splendid cameos and great dialogues, the movie got it all right on the money. Highly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Provocative, it's not as good as they say, but it's still worth it.","Films that satirize cinema always find their audience. In this case, we have a group of decadent actors, full of problems (insecurities, depressions, drug use, etc.), amid a chaotic and unprofessional film set. In order to get the most out of the cast and more control over the set, the director and producer decide to leave the main actors in the jungle, in their characters, for a mission on the ground. What they did not expect was that they really had to fight, since a group of drug traffickers, by coincidence, controlled the area where they were left. The film was a success, and ended up being nominated for the industry's big prizes including an Oscar nomination in 2009, one of the years when the statuettes were most unfairly awarded.As can be seen, the script shoots in several directions when it satirizes the film industry: some criticisms are highly pertinent, such as that made to the financiers' power over creative freedom and the conduction of projects, the abuse of merchandising and advertising in films or the way in which actors sink into addiction, depression or other problems. There are several cinematographic genres criticized here, such as war blockbusters, cheap comedies and films with adult or provocative content (like the parody about monks, at the beginning). Such a film could not be politically correct, and here there is plenty material to offend everyone, starting with the dialogues, filled with heavy slang and offensive sentences, to racism (a white actor who paints himself to make a black character) and discrimination (a fat actor who is famous only for making a flatulence film or the use of jokes about mentally disabled people, involving a false film made by one of the characters). It is a film that will certainly offend a lot of people, but I deal with it very well: the politically correct has become such a dictatorship that it is good to question it. Unfortunately, from the middle, the film becomes more and more predictable and simple, until reaching a conventional end, that is effective and solves the story well.Directed and written by Ben Stiller, who reserves one of the most central roles for himself, the film brings together a series of renowned comedy actors, all at their best, starting with Stiller himself, who does a truly successful job. The film also features Jack Black, who is perfect in his role, tailor-made for him, and also Robert Downey Jr., an actor I don't usually associate with comedy, but who has shown, continuously, to be much more than Iron Man. I especially liked the way Downey Jr. And Stiller played together, with dialogues that are both witty and provocative. Nick Nolte also appears and does a very good job on a secondary character. On the negative side, I would highlight the irritating work of Tom Cruise, who was given a character apparently as narcissistic as the actor himself, and the somewhat neutral and forgettable performances of Jay Baruchel and Brandon T. Jackson.At a technical level, the film shows well how much it cost to produce: the sets are really very good and detailed, the filming locations were meticulously chosen and the costumes were carefully made. The make-up team also deserves applause for the amount of resources used and the way in which they knew how to use them: just look at the way Tom Cruise is unrecognizable, to give a simple example. Cinematography does not bring anything particularly good, but the editing was well done and the visual, special and sound effects are excellent.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

OVERRATED,"When it came out the hype was big. At the trailers they showed their best bits, but you didn´t know that beforehand. And by the time you finish the movie you realize it was all a waste of limitless talent.I have nothing against any of these people. But, to me, it´s all forced comedy. They tried too hard to make things funny. It´s a big production with lots of A-star actors, but it doesn´t make it better. They come too short in the execution of comedy. The only exception is Robert Downey jr. And his amazing character. Stiller gave us the other good element in the film. Sadly, Jack Black´s character didn´t make me laugh at all, and the rest just served as supporting cast when you expected big things from them. Tom Cruise´s phone-call was indeed funny.It was a long underdone comedy.I laughed harder and longer at many other smaller comedies than this.

"A fun, hilarious, irreverent, full blown satire of Hollywood","Tropic Thunder is an excellent satirical gem made by the prolific Ben Stiller. Its about an uneven group of actors that attempt to film a war film in Vietnam and through a series of events their filming turns into a race for their lives as they stumble across REAL bad guys.Stiller has produced a type of film that I have never seen before. It isn't just a series of parodies, its a series of satire. If you like, this is an 'epic movie' type film with quality. The film references are subtle, the satire is subtle and unsubtle at times, its perfectly balanced. A top quality series of comedy that is sure to please anybody that has ever seen a Hollywood film before.The only direct satire I could spot was Downey Jr's character. Its most probably Daniel Day Lewis or Russell Crowe. Also Downey Jr's performance was excellent.

I almost cried laughing.I'm not a huge Stiller fan but I'll watch his movies. I'm even less of a Jack Black fan but I won't go out of my way to avoid his movies. And I had never even seen Robert Downey Jr. in a comedy. I will say this: Downey Jr. was classic... no, better. He played his role so well and delivered his lines so perfectly he stole the show.Stiller was good, and Black held his own. Now for the X-Factor; the guy who didn't headline but was down right a riot nonetheless... Tom Cruise!!! He was excellent in his small yet crucial role. I never knew he could be so funny.Listen... this movie no doubt pushes the envelope which is one of the reasons it's so funny. The humor is not for everyone as they toe the line with a few taboo topics: racial humor, gay humor and even jokes at the expense of the mentally handicapped.

To put it simply - the humour here just doesn't translate overseas.This film was like watching Stiller and his rich friends in their living room making crap industry-insider jokes and patting each other on the back. This was barely a film at all.I think it would be unfair for me to say the film is terrible (the fake trailers at the start are great) but the above rating really applies to my experience watching this - I'd strongly recommend any Brits to give this one a miss.Aside from Downey Jr and his advice to 'never go full retard,' I found the jokes unfunny and the editing incomprehensible.For some reason most of the cast seem to think that 'louder = funnier' and the more they overact the louder the laughs will be. Jack Black is really intolerable here. Too many insider jokes, too many American references that go understood and the dialogue is very hard to understand at times.Cruises cameo does raise a smirk here and there but the ending credits are cringeworthy - the man is clearly desperate to be loved.

"pretty funny, i'm surprised by how many bad reviews","Sure, this isn't the funniest movie Ben Stiller has been in, but I still thought it was pretty good. Robert Downey Jr and Tom Cruise steal the movie with 2 great characters. Downey plays an Oscar winning actor whom really gets into his roles. In this war movie, he's gone black both in skin color and the way he talks. It's funny. And Cruise plays the head of the movie studio and all he does is cuss and be an *sshole. It's very funny.The movie is about this group of actors whom are in Vietnam to film a movie. In order to make it more realistic, the director takes the actors into the jungle. They have cameras and explosives already set up. So, the actors believe it's part of the movie, however, there is a group of drug dealers that are really shooting at them and capture a few of them. Stiller, is Tug Speedman, sort of washed up action star whom is playing the lead. The way he talks in character is very funny. Jack Black is the dope head whom is suffering withdrawals in the jungle. Some unknown is Alpha Chino, a rapper whom raps a rather dirty song: I love the *****.The director steps on a mine and Tug thinks it is fake and picks up his head and does all this gross stuff. It was gross but I found myself laughing. Another funny scene was Kirk telling Tug don't go retard all the way, that's why you didn't win the Oscar.Matt Mcconhay plays Tug's agent, has some funny scenes. But Nick Nolte was better as the crazy war vet that wrote the book Tropic Thunder. But we learn Nolte's character isn't telling the whole truth, which was funny.

practically everything about this movie is uproarious; the satire/parody of the year!,"I read a review of Tropic Thunder that said it's satire, not parody, that there's a distinct difference and the film knows it. I'd agree that there is a difference, but I'd add that Stiller doesn't give a great big hoot about sticking to one or the other. Tropic Thunder does satirize its subjects: movie stars, movie moguls, ""dedictation"" to the craft of acting, the crap that churns out in Hollywood, and the Vietnam war. But there's parody running throughout the picture, if only in the first half of the picture and particularly in those incredible trailers that open the movie (all of them are fall-down laughing, and even give certain laughs for certain movie fans). It's one of the most deft mixes of parody and satire, where they sometimes run along with one another through the jungle and full of blood and guts and awesome one-liners. To give a higher compliment- it's some of the best since Mel Brooks.It's simple to break down the premise, since it's right in the trailer: primadonna movie stars- one action, Tugg Speedman, aka 'Tuggernuts' (Stiller); one comedy, Jeff Portnoy (Black); one the ""acclaimed"" method actor Kirk Lazarus (Downey Jr)- are starring in a Vietnam war movie that is going haywire, and so the director (Coogan) gets tips from the military adviser/author of the book Tropic Thunder (Nolte) to send the stars out into the *real* jungle to film the movie. Then, of course, everything goes to hell, right even before they leave the drop point of where the helicopter drops them off (wont spoil it, but there's a great gag involving a severed head for a few minutes). Stiller goes close to overload as the movie goes on- mocking the brash studio executive (Tom Cruise- yes, Tom Cruise, and he's BALD!) and Speedman's puppy-dog agent (McConaughey), and the fact that the drug cartel who captures Speedman in the jungle are a HUGE fans of Stiller's ""retard"" movie, Simple Jack.I might add, don't think because I put ""retard"" in quotes that it's offensive. Stiller's aim here is to completely annihilate ALL of the self-indulgent and self-righteous movies, so there are no prisoners taken in the course of Tropic Thunder. This scores it extra points, but above all else it's the fact that it's Ben Stiller as a ""retard"" (and at one point performing the entire movie at gun point to the cartel workers), Robert Downey Jr is a ""dude playing a dude disguised as another dude"", and Black as a, uh, heroin addicted star of stupid fart comedies (which, oddly enough, is to Black's credit that he pulls off a role I didn't think would work). It has that same overt and palpable ludicrous vibe of Zoolander, only even more focused on character and sharper at telling the story. For all the insanity and just continuous ""did he just SAY or DO that"" antics in Tropic Thunder, sometimes involving lots of violence or gobs of racism, Stiller doesn't forget to direct, and in fact it's maybe his best directing job yet. Pineapple Express might have gone to more extremes but, frankly, this is funnier.How funny may depend on how much you can take of each characters' ""shtick"". Frankly, I couldn't get enough, and loved just the surprise cameos and bit parts (Tobey Maguire is one real notable) that revealed how in tune they were with the rest of the project. Only in recent memory is Walk Hard comparable in going so far to deliver joke after joke that just connects either due to great dialog (""I'm the rooster illusion""), great rapport between the actors, some of which are just the drug dealers at the prison camp like the kid Brandon Soo-Hoo, and a finite ability to tap into how shallow and amazing movies can get.

As filming goes on, however, what once were fake special effects and stunts become very real very fast. Ben Stiller and Jack Black are funny as always but the standout performances come from Robert Downey Jr. who plays a white Australian preppy playing a black American soldier and Nick Nolte who acts as the beaten and battered Vietnam War vet movie consultant with hooks for hands.

"""Beneath it's hard surface .""","""Topic Thunder"" seems the perfect title for a war movie parody, certainly better than ""Hot Shots, Part Deux."" ""Tropic Thunder"" also suggests a kind of suntan lotion spread on imagined hard bodies lying around the Olympic size pool of fictional movie mogul Sid Grossman (modeled on Joel Silver, perhaps?). Sadly, like most suntan oils, ""Tropic Thunder"" does not live up to its promise to protect the delicate skins of those buying the product.Tug Speedman (Ben Stiller) is an amalgam of shallow action movie heroes, bulked up like Stallone, but more clearly modeled on Tom Cruise. Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black) is a blend of Chris Farley and Eddie Murphy and Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey, Jr.) is certainly the method-obsessed Aussie, Russell Crowe.

Where is your farm?,"Let's get this out of the way first: satirical blackface is still blackface. Though the film is aware of what it's doing and includes several mitigating factors that downplay the offensive nature of this element (such as the fact that Downey Jr. Is playing a white guy playing a black guy, rather than simply playing a black guy himself, and the fact that the actual black guy in the group is constantly calling him out for it) and allow it to exist in the same satirically tongue-in-cheek space as the rest of the affair, the sequences in which the joke leans more towards the stereotypical representation of a black man rather than the fact that the black man is being played stereotypically by a pretentious white actor are still rather uncomfortable. It's also quite disturbing that the Academy decided to nominate a blackface performance in the 21st century (though it would be disturbing no matter the year, of course). Having said all that, I am aware that 'Tropic Thunder (2008)' itself isn't malicious in any way; the inclusion of blackface is a commentary on the increasing lengths so-called method actors will go to in order to immerse themselves in a character, rather than a way to include a hateful depiction of a black character without having to cast a black man in the role as was historically the case. Even so, it's a bit strange that they decided to include blackface without even making reference to its insanely harmful history. Since the satire isn't about blackface or Hollywood's history of using it, but rather about method acting, you do have to wonder if its inclusion was necessary at all. Still, though this aspect of the film is controversial and, frankly, rather tone-deaf, it doesn't ruin the overall experience - at lest, for me - because, as I mentioned earlier, the flick doesn't feel malicious at all. For the most part, the piece is a charmingly ridiculous satire of 'true story' movies, guerrilla filmmaking, big-budget blockbusters, the vanity of actors and, in general, the entire Hollywood machine. The actors almost all play against type and there are plenty of funny sequences that stand the test of time. The thing isn't exactly deep, nor is its satire all that biting, but it does a good job of showing how silly and selfish the filmmaking industry can be and gives you a good few giggles while it does it. It's a solid comedy. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Still one of my favorite movies ever,"I've seen this movie quite a lot of times since it came out 11 years ago and it just cracks me up every time I watch it. If you haven't yet gotten around to watching this movie, then what are you waiting for?",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Tropic Thunder,"Well I just got back from a sneak preview (benefits of managing a movie theater). I was not impressed.It starts off vulgar and stays that way throughout. Vulgarity has its place in films but on this one it felt like it was going a tad overboard. I think my husband laughed out loud once or twice and he is very easily amused so that says a lot.I was bored, my 20 year old son was bored and we both said ""I thought it was going to be better than that."" Ahhh another case of good trailer/not so good movie.Robert Downey Jr was great. I loved seeing him play a black man. He did mumble a lot though and many times was just plain incoherent.Jack Black is quite funny as a drug addicted fattie.Tom Cruise could have been so much more awesome if he had disguised his voice but he didn't so it was just Tom Cruise in a fat suit. That fell flat. His dancing was kinda cute though.The best thing about Ben Stiller was his arms. Even next to Robert Downey Jr who is probably the hottest guy in movies I was still admiring Stillers arms. Other than that it was just Ben Stiller in a movie. Same ol Same ol.The best part was this kid that is like the leader of the Viet Cong. He is a total badA22 and a pretty good actor for a kid. I enjoyed him. He was actually kinda scary. lolConclusion: Not for kids. (I let my kids watch some R movies but not this one, just an extra warning for parents). There is a lot of cussing and a few homosexual references including a very detailed description of a bj. 20-30 something guys will love it. Your girlfriends may be bored. I wouldn't shell out over 5 dollars to see it. Wait for it on video.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Decent comedy, a couple of laughs.","Perhaps I was expecting too much from this comedy. Ben Stiller films can be funny when done well, ""The Cable Guy"" ""Zoolander"" ""Reality Bites"" etc. but this one tried to beat the same jokes over and over. Pretty predictable and kind of boring towards the end. The best laughs came in the start of the film with the Mach previews, but then the jokes form the beginning were recycled over and over. I'm not sure if this film was trying too hard or not hard enough. Tom Cruise has a comedic turn as ""Les Grossman"" the billionaire backing the film, and the scenes with him dancing were pretty funny. All in all, not worth ten bucks, but probably worth renting on Netfix or watching on cable if you are really stoned.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Extremely Disappointed!,"Depending what direction your moral compass points will determine whether or not you enjoy this movie. I don't know what Ben Stiller was thinking when he crossed the line and dove head first into the ridiculous. I found myself unable to laugh at the failed attempts to shock humor us, I actually found myself cringing and embarrassed that they would try to get someone to even chuckle. I am a huge Stiller fan but this movie went way below any expectations I could have imagined. This movie had such potential if it would have only been made in a way that focused on intelligent creative humor and not trying to grab a cheap laugh from a severed head etc. I may be the exception but out of the 12 people in the theater I heard 4 laughs during the entire time I was there. I did leave about 30 min. before the end but I can bet it didn't get many more. I hope that after this disaster Ben will return to the kind of scripts that made him a superstar in the comedic world of film. Ben if you read this (highly unlikely) just remember the hippopotamoose and the zebra. Now thats funny, I don't care who you are.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Summer Breeze,"Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey, Jr.): ""I know who I am! I'm the dude playing the dude disguised as another dude!""Finally this summer, a chance to belly laugh at the super-hero syndrome. Ben Stiller's Tropic Thunder satirizes just about every self-absorbed actor who has ever played a hero, including Robert Downey, Jr., this summer's Iron Man, playing a five Oscar winner dying his face to look like a black man and acting all the clichés. His comment above synthesizes this film's irreverent attitude toward an entire industry of phonies and narcissists.While making the war picture to end all war pictures, a movie production is lost in the jungle, only to find themselves in real combat with narco-terrorists. The crew includes some over-the-hill heroes such as Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller), a Sylvester Stallone knockoff, Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black), a parody of his fat/farting self, and Lazarus. At home, Tom Cruise does an impressive take on a balding, bloated financier, who could be a type of Sumner Redstone, Cruise's nemesis in real life. Matthew McConaughey as Rick Peck, Speedman's faithful agent, also plays the laughs and satire just right.The current flack over the film's treatment of mentally challenged people is not without merit""You never go full retard""but loses thrust when you consider most of the movie makes fun of most everybody. Criticism could be leveled at performances that garble words, such as Downey's when he tries to mimic stereotypical Black dialogue patterns. Too much of the film's dialogue is lost in the frenzy of blasting and blathering.Last year's Wild Hogs came at the right time in the summer; Stiller's titillating Tropic Thunder is a summer breeze of laughs, base humor, and biting satire of an industry that can make money making fun of itself.",,Anonymous,Comedy
"Three Amigos, but more expensive","Remember the movie Three Amigos? Would you like to see a version with upscaled production values, but less actual comedy? Here ya go!To be fair, Tropic Thunder does have some iconic moments that have penetrated and stuck with us, but it's not ACTUALLY that funny. In some ways it's more realistic than Three Amigos, in other ways less. But whereas Amigos was a steady diet of solid gags that landed, I'd say that the humor here is fewer and further between.Tropic Thunder isn't a BAD movie, but it's a massively overrated one. It's commentary on the Hollywood machine of which it is a part is done better and lands more on the nose than Amigos, I will give it that. But really, this is Ben Stiller playing the same character you've always seen him play, Jack Black playing the same character he always plays, Nick Nolte playing the same character. McConoughey playing the same guy...really Robert Downey is the only one who does anything noteworthy or interesting.And I just want to say again, I'm not saying it's a bad movie. But if you read other reviews of it, you walk away thinking it's some all-time great comedy, and it's just not. It's a'ight, as they say.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Raunchy Mature Film Comedy with Flashes of the Real Stuff,"21 August 2008. It's hard to really capture the essence of this ""terribly,"" good movie. It's hardcore, adult comedy like on the comedy circuit except it's in the form of a full length feature film with special effects. The dialogue is raw and rough like straight out of the R-Rated Las Vegas comedy strip. This is a daring, risky, and no holds bar comedy acts that drip, gush, explode off the screen, offensive, satiric, and dangerously cruel. Yet there are scenes that are effusive with true emotional, heart-rending and though-provoking drama. This film is a daring mixture of raw comedy with drama, shocking, and brilliantly funny at times. Not every scene connects with all audience members and at times it borders of embarrassingly sick. But the comedy and the sincerity is amazingly fresh from a feature film. This is comedy at the fringe edges, qualifying this film for cult status. Eight out of Ten Stars.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Much better than I expected,"Actually, (and this from someone who doesn't usually like comedies), I thought this film was excellent but it is probably not for the young or squeamish.Although it is a parody of war movies in general and also of actors and Hollywood at large, it contains considerable extremely graphic violence of the theatrical kind but is well worth watching for most audiences nonetheless.The first sequences are somewhat less mature than the body of the movie, (I almost pulled it's plug - I'm glad I didn't), wait until all of it's levels are revealed - there's some really great and very funny stuff therein.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Tropic Thunder 2008 Review,"This movie has such an incredible cast; RDJ, Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Tobey Maguire, Nick Nolte, Bill Hader, McConaughey, Tom Cruise, I mean this film was bound to be amazing.Tropic Thunder has to be one of the best comedy's i've seen. It's offensive in just the right ways, it makes fun of itself in being a satire of everything that it is, it's genius.
It never overstays its welcome, it doesn't push the jokes too far to the point of them becoming annoying, the film is extremely quotable, the action is great, every character has their moment, and the story was actually cohesive and fun!
The combination of the action and comedy played off of the characters environment perfectly making the humor hit home in every scene. It never lets off the gas.I don't think we'll ever see a comedy movie like this in a very, very long time if at all.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"""I don't read the script. The script reads me.""","""Tropic Thunder"" is one of those movies that you either like or dislike, there is no middle. I liked this movie and it's one of the better Ben Stiller movies but here Stiller, as director-actor-writer-producer, turns center of attention away from him. In many scenes there is no Stiller, which makes stars like Downey Jr., Black, Cruise, McConaughey and others their share of time on screen. Stiller imagined this one to be a parody of every war movie and that's what this movie is all about. If you expect to see something other then plain jokes about everything (church - Maguire & Downey Jr., mental retardation - bothered me little, war, war heroes - Nolte, movie makers, movie stars - behavior of actors on the set before they were put in the jungle, studio head - Cruise, Oscars...) just don't waste your money to see this movie. But if you're in for fun this will be a great ride. Connoisseurs of war movies will easily recognize classic war movies like ""Apocalypse Now"", ""Platoon"", ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" and if anyone felt offended about spoofing them, I say don't be. Although I am a big fan of those movies, this is a comedy, where everything is allowed. The whole movie also gets big plus in amount of very well known faces skillfully combined together; so we've got comedy genius Jack Black, very good Tom Cruise (not the best role like someone said), solid Jay Baruchel & Brandon T. Jackson (Alpa Chino :D), Matthew McConaughey as Stiller's agent, Nick Nolte as fake movie veteran, and cameo appearances of Maguire, Voight, Love Hewitt, Rooney, Banks... I purposely left out one name that really stands alone and raises above every single actor in this movie (at least in my opinion): Robert Downey Jr. He is such a brilliant actor, neglected because of his drug problems and in need for big blockbuster that would put him on A acting list. His hit blockbuster was ""Iron Man"", just like Johnny Depp's world popularity with Pirates; although they were brilliant before those movies in eyes of a true movie lovers. His performance as Kirk Lazarus, Australian, winner of 5 Oscars, that turned black for his new role, is one of the funniest roles in comedy ever. His appearance, attitude, accent and style is amazing and he should be the only reason why this movie should get a passing grade in eyes of those who disliked it (although I don't see the reasons why). To sum it all up, here we've got a great comedy coming from Ben Stiller, with memorable Robert Downey Jr.'s interpretation of Kirk Lazarus that will stay with you long after you finish watching this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Tropic Thunder - review, 8/10","A movie about a group of actors subjected to the mercy of the jungle and an organised band of heroin traffickers isn't a typical pitch for a comedy, but man, it really, really works.It's the hilarious performances of the star-studded cast that make the movie so great. The film is blessed with the likes of Jack Black, Matthew McConaughey, Tom Cruise, Ben Stiller and Robert Downey Jr. (as well as many more), all of whom were perfect for their roles; Tom Cruise as a bald, foul-mouthed studio executive and Robert Downey Jr. as a white Australian / black soldier (no, that isn't typo) are by far the funniest performance of the movie, almost every scene the each of them were in had me crying.One thing I will say about the movie, and this isn't a fault per say, is that it goes into maximum overdrive with the gore, action and explosions, and isn't concerned about treading over toes when it comes to what some may perceive as more sensitive topics such as mental retardation and race; the jokes made are obviously not malicious but if you're looking for a clean comedy or have a (very) low tolerance for those kinds of things then you won't enjoy the film. You have been warned.Tropic Thunder is just oozing layers of satire and parody, is jam-packed with an A-list cast, explosions and manages to find that balance between obnoxiously crazy and obnoxiously safe with great success. Easily one of the funniest and most enjoyable movies I've seen in a while, just fantastic.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Fantastic Beginning and End, A Little Slow in the Middle","Tropic Thunder follows a group of actors trying to recreate the events of a war in a movie, but ultimately are sent out into a real war, only they think they're still filming a movie.The plot is, as you probably have already noticed, pretty hilarious. Of course, that alone isn't enough to make a funny movie. Tropic Thunder manages to pull that off, thankfully. The beginning of the movie is quite hilarious, and the ending is too. Unfortunately the middle portions weren't as funny, and they were a little confusing and slow at times. I think that that was mostly due to the fact that it wasn't what I expected. Nevertheless, it wasn't horribly boring, and the final act more than makes up for it.The characters are pretty decent. They aren't super deep or anything, but you still get a good idea of who they are, and you feel like there's more to some of them. All the rest are either unimportant or just there to be really goofy.Overall Tropic Thunder is a solid comedy. While it can be a bit slow in the middle, the beginning and end more than make up for it. I'll certainly be seeing this one again, and in the end I'd definitely recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Not so funny,"This film is about several actors filming for a failing Hollywood war production in the middle of a real war zone.I did not find this film as funny as people claim. Many jokes fall flat. Jack Black makes exaggerated shouts and moves all the time, which is annoying rather than funny. The ""Simple Jack"" joke was not funny, it's just plain silly. I find it hard to believe that ""Simply Jack"" happens to be the only film the Vietnamese drug lords have seen. Isn't that too much of a coincidence? Having a child to lead a drug gang is in fact sad. References to Jennifer Love Hewitt and Lance make bring a small giggle, but that's it. I think this film had so much promise with the interesting idea and a stellar cast. But unfortunately it did not work for me.",,Anonymous,Comedy
"Make laughs, not war","Hollywood is hilarious. They've got agents ready to cover up dead hookers upon demand and actors with mandatory Tivo in their contracts. They've even got heads on the ends of rifles and people biting into live bats. Wait. That isn't funny. It's just plain dumb. There's a fine line between crazy funny and scalping a panda you just killed to wear on your head. TROPIC THUNDER never figures out how to walk that line, falling on either side of it for some pretty uneven results.In his first directing gig since the, and I can't believe I'm writing this, infinitely more cohesive, ZOOLANDER, Ben Stiller takes a bunch of pampered actors and drop them in the middle of Vietnam so that they can shoot the greatest war movie ever (as if APOCAPLYPSE NOW would just crawl into a ditch with a live grenade or something). It's funny in theory, sure, but even Stiller drops the concept early in. With the plot left behind, the men are left to trip over each other in the jungle, which is occasionally cool given that Robert Downey Jr. and Jack Black are fine company to keep but mostly it's just meandering. I think they're trying to make it home but who cares really when we keep cutting back to a bald headed, furry- chested, Tom Cruise as a Hollywood executive who just loves telling people to (bleep) themselves whenever he feels like. (Seriously though, he's pretty funny.)Thank you, Ben Stiller, for showing me just how hilarious Hollywood likes to think it is and for reminding me just how far out of step it is with the rest of the world. One minute, you're laughing hysterically at them. The next, they're the only ones in on the joke and they're laughing all by themselves.

Mediocre at best,"This film is carried greatly by the performance of Robert Downey Jr., who has done an amazing job in recent films such as this and Ironman. However, Downey is a man alone in this film. None of the other actors help him out. Jack Black has done a great job recently in more serious roles but in this film turns right back into the nacho libre of old. Ben Stiller disappoints as he miscast himself in his own film. He was absolutely wrong for the role and failed to create humor. There were some decent appearances such as MM as the agent and Tom Cruise as les but there were minor roles and could do nothing to overcome the failures of the rest of the actors. Nick Nolte even disappoints in limited work. However, the movie does deserve somewhere about a 7, maybe a 6.6 because Robert Downey Jr. does the job of providing laughs for all. The racist jokes are, well, racist, but both the African Americans and the Caucasians seemed to find them funny and not offensive.

Well, maybe the Farrelly Brothers, but that's not so much the point as the fact that Ben Stiller conceived and acted it with help from his own sympathetic brothers-in-arms - literally! From the fake advertisements and trailers before the film to the last lampoon with Tom Cruise it never lets up in it's look at the superficiality of all things that make up the industry.

A very fun original comedy,Tropic Thunder was a pretty good comedy movie although not the best this summer. I think this was a pretty good comedy but it could have been better. The cast was very good and did a great job. Ben Stiller was really funny and was the best of all the actors. Robert Downey Jr. was great and was funny as well. His facial expressions really made him funny. The beginning was really explaining short little clips of the characters movies they made. They do make fun of retards and things like that a lot in the movie. This movie was definitely not something I would have a younger kid see. It had many mature elements in this movie. The visuals were very cool. I loved how they mixed in war and comedy. The music in this movie was really good as well. It was a very original comedy and entertaining.

True the acting is pretty good and the film is funny as it tries to put something together.

You have well known stars as Ben Stiller, Jack Black, and Robert Downey Jr. who all portray big Hollywood stars. And all of them have agreed to help their struggling careers to get together and do a war picture a friendship type film that is mostly funny a comedy that mocks fun at many others really just a big film parody. In the scenes you see films like ""Easy Rider"", ""Platoon"", and ""Apocalypse Now"" portrayed and mocked.

All time great satire,"The opening trailers of Tropic Thunder are painfully funny as they make fun of several of the most prominent genres in Hollywood, the film that follows is just as funny and effective in its lambasting of the film industry. It's a testament to the skill of a comedy when it can ruin other movies because of how strong the satire is and it's only got better since the same mistakes it's criticising still occur after it's release.The whole cast are totally committed to the bit. Ben Stiller goes from self obsessed to insane in hilarious fashion, Jack Black is completely feral in a contrast to his usual loveable nature, and Jay Baruchel is the obvious choice to be the one who plays it straight. Robert Downey Jr. Steals everything with his method actor who takes the craft to a horrifying extreme, made even funnier Brandon T. Jackson's reactions to his misguided method acting.Outside of the core cast there's a bunch of very memorable supporting performances. Danny McBride plays squarely to his strengths, Matthew McConaughey's tivo obsessed agent mines his charm for great laughs, and then there's Tom Cruise. He makes an already genius role even better with the decision to undergo a physical transformation as well, turning his ruthless producer into one of his greatest performances.Ben Stiller's direction can parody the most overdone tropes, cleverly references some of the best Vietnam films with ease and brings the film full circle in satisfying fashion. It's an unusually epic comedy with large scale actions and a generous helping of explosions that compliments all the jokes and endlessly quotable dialogue. The soundtrack doubles down on the references to Vietnam movies by including a lot of the most recognisable songs of the genre.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Almost very clever,"If Ben Stiller never existed, Tropic Thunder could have been a masterpiece. I'm fairly certain it's entirely fair to pin Thunder's failings entirely on Stiller's mainstream comedic sensibilities. After all, it's his character whose arc is the least...(read more) self-aware. In Stiller's mind, he is still a hero in Tropic Thunder, but the actual hero is clearly Jay Baruchel who pulls off a very funny and incredibly likable performance as the only not-yet famous actor in the film within the film. He's put-upon, but delightfully earnest.Don't get me wrong, there's some truly great stuff here. I found myself laughing hard and loud more times than I can count, but there would also be gaps where I wouldn't even giggle. If the gags - which are plentiful - aren't working, it's because they are one tweak away from perfection or one toke over the line.Tom Cruise is getting most of the hype here, and it's well-deserved. As Les Grossman, the overweight, bald studio head, Cruise is hilariously crude. It's a great cameo. But then it stops being a cameo, as Cruise just keeps coming back, even dancing to a Ludicrous song over the end credits - a prime example of running a brilliant joke into the ground, something Stiller knows a a lot about.Still, I have no problem enthusiastically reccomending Tropic Thunder to anyone.

"Downey Jr. and Cruise are the thunder and the lightning of ""Tropic Thunder""","Comedy, Tragedy, Parody- ""Tropic Thunder"" does encompass the aforementioned three elements to certain degrees.Comedy- Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Robert Downey Jr., Jay Baruchel, and Brandon T. Jackson portray Hollywood thespians who are acting in a ""Platoon""-type war film entitled, what do you know, ""Tropic Thunder"". Stiller is Tugg Speedman, the Hollywood action hero whose latest action film franchise has recently run out of speed. Jack Black plays Jeff Portnoy, the comedic chunky actor who starred in a flatulence-induced comedic franchise called ""The Fatties"" and is trying to prove he has the acting diversity to also do le drama. Robert Downey Jr. is Kirk Lazarus, the acclaimed Academy Award winner whose method acting runs in his blood so much that for his lunatic role in Thunder he goes to the dark side by going through a procedure that pigments his skin color and wants it to quote the Stones ""Paint it Black"". Jay Baruchel plays the youthful rookie actor Kevin Sandusky who has been an avid fan of the aforementioned, but is more level headed than his mentors. And Brandon T. Jackson plays Alpha Chino the rapper turned actor who made his claim to fame by promoting an energy drink called ""Booty Sweat"". When the film's director Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan) has numerous troubling challenges in working with these prima-donnas, the Hollywood studio bosses take notice and desolate the thespian Thunderous group into the isolated jungle fighting a real war against some Asian drug-ring soldiers. What does not strike thunder to these egomaniacs is that they are no longer shooting a film but in fact are really shooting at them! There are certain mundane misfires to that aspect, as it does get monotonous after a few scenes. But fiery comedic turns by Robert Downey Jr. as Lazarus and an unrecognizable Tom Cruise as an authoritative Hollywood studio boss Les Grossman does salvage ""Tropic Thunder"" to thunderous laughing explosions that are strictly the bomb!Tragedy- Nick Nolte portraying a former war veteran named Four Leaf Tayback who is also the film's technical adviser was not the four leaf clover ""Tropic Thunder"" needed. It was quite a tragedy to observe Nolte playing the same old anger-induced egomaniac character which he has overkilled in many previous Nolte roles. I also did not observe any relevance to the plot in Danny McBride's performance as Cody, the technical effects guru whose clumsy acts were just a failed effectual effort for laughs that were not special in any comedic technicality. Ben Stiller also directed and co-wrote ""Tropic Thunder"" and somewhere along the way it was a tragedy to watch Stiller get lost in the jungle with the script and direction of the film by sidetracking it with irrelevant scenes that should have been fired out.Parody- Even though I pulled in a few hard knocks for Stiller, I do commend him for his efforts in deriving the premise of ""Tropic Thunder"". The self-obsessed nature of the film industry were presented to the viewers as messaging that it is part of the fabric nature of making films, and at the end it should not be taken too seriously as long as the cinematic end-product is of above satisfactory material. ""Tropic Thunder"" never reaches the jungles of above satisfactory material but it does land us with some classical parody delights in the work of Downey Jr. and Cruise. *** Average",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Not Funny - A Fair Appraisal,"Behind Hollywood's cameras are legions of underpaid helpers doting on pampered mega-celebrities. Egos and budgets have become so inflated that much of the screen time once devoted to the dynamic relationship between an actor and his role have been replaced by product ads, staid repetition and computer generated doo-dah's. As such, much of the grittiness of early cinema is being gradually reduced to a strict regimen of movie-making by numbers. And, by now, what the average member of the public is often exposed to upon an innocent trip to the cinema is the mass-market mass-murder of an entire art form  at a cost of £8 a go! To determine who is responsible for this you need look no further than the mega-celebrities themselves. This is partly why I found Tropic Thunder so detestable. I enjoyed this expose on the vanity & shallowness of Hollywood by those who are perpetrating it as much as I would a lecture on cultural diversity as conducted by a member of the Third Reich.Those who haven't yet seen the film and merely want a light, comical romp written by and starring a few funny guys will also be disappointed. I'm afraid the film fails to deliver even on this front. The scenes involving Tom Cruise go beyond being simply unfunny or cringe-worthy to the point whereby funnier men, perhaps those long since dead, would be sickened by or turning in their graves as a result of them. I would suggest that even the stars of the movie should, by all rights, have made themselves feel a little queasy.It's not that there are no funny jokes in the film  it's just that all 3 of them get lost in a jumble of film making where the ability to suspend belief just isn't enough. Ben Stiller is OK in the movie, as is Jack Black. They are too eminently likable to deride and seem more like they belong in this movie than the others. Although this is coming from a man who never saw 'Envy,' which may be so awful as to nullify my generosity towards them.Furthermore, the character played by Robert Downey Jr is catastrophic - despite Downey's valiant effort at making the rotten role work. For those who don't know, he is essentially a modern day minstrel (white guy 'blacked-up') who has grown proud of his elective-surgery-altered skin colour - rather unconvincingly so to those who are of that skin colour by birth. This is a mechanism often used in films for some cheap comedy, and a technique that worked rather well - for a time. It was hilarious in Airplane when the old lady talked jive, for example. But the art of it 'being funny when a white person spoke like a black person' died a horrible death, or at least was beaten to a bloody pulp, when Steve Martin starred in the reprehensible 'Bringing Down the House.' And if there was any doubt as to the damage done by Martin, then watching Tom Cruise also decide to dance like a black person is where that debate draws to an emphatic close. It just isn't funny.Nor, for that matter, is Steve Coogan, who should know far better. Nor is Matthew McWhoever  who's odd, surplus character is a vacuous Hollywood agent who goes to a war-zone over a Tivo dispute (and somehow escapes on foot where the leads of the film barely made it with a head-start and a helicopter.) Nor is the explosives expert who comes across as a caricature of a caricature of a Kevin Smith/Napoleon Dynamite style 'dude' character who's role would be cut-down to one line during the editing process. Nor is the guy playing the rapper who isn't a natural comedian and seemingly shouldn't be an actor. Nor is the joke about Booty Juice - and even less so it's continual usage. Not even comical is the laughable choice of casting a child as the main 'bad guy.' Just after his miniature silhouette arrived on screen I was plunging two fingers down my throat in a vain attempt to purge the newly-acquired badness from the pit of my soul.But on a lighter note, there are two things about this movie I do like. 1/ The bit where Jack Black says, ""Ouch, my ass!"" 2/ The fact that next to running time it didn't say 'Eternity.' In conclusion, if a friend asks you to go see Tropic Thunder with him, just look at him, dead in the eyes for as long as it takes - ignoring his appeals that you look away or respond - until he becomes so uncomfortable with the morbid atmosphere that he will be left with no choice but to eventually mutter under his breath, in a defeated whisper, ""guess not then""",,Anonymous,Comedy
Apocalypse Not,"Two days ago I plunked down $24 to take my girlfriend to see Tropic Thunder and, while it didn't disappoint, it did fall victim to the same shortcoming most comedies suffer: turning a high concept into a laugh sustaining 90 minute movie.TT starts out with three eye- wateringly funny mock trailers that introduce us to the stars of the fictional Vietnam war movie ""Tropic Thunder:"" Tugg Speedman (Stiller) a brainless and vain action film star, Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black) a drug addicted fat pig of a fart famed comic and Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.) an Academy Award adorned Aussie method actor. When the film's director Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan) has his production threatened by ape-like studio magnate Les Grossman (Tom Cruise), Coogan takes the advice of 'Nam Vet Leaf Tayback (Nick Nolte) to throw his sissy actors into ""the sh##"" in order to make the grittiest, most realistic war movie EVER.As you'd expect, things don't play out so well for Cockburn and as the three actors' misadventure devolves into a serious FUGAZI, we get a solid 40 minutes of gut crunching laughs. But then TT runs out of steam, it's clever concept and it's actors foibles paraded to the point of comedic fatigue and, aside from a remaining handful of insultingly un-PC jabs, the laughs devolve into a declining pattern of chuckles.Regardless of TT's inability to keep the laughs cranked up from beginning to end, Robert Downey Jr flexes chiseled comedic chops that harken back to his priceless supporting work as Wayne Gale in Natural Born Killers. While TT may be the best comedy of the summer, it is far from being one of the best comedies ever, yet in a movie-going comedy desert, TT is a tantalizing mirage worth seeing for RDJ's work alone. It should also be noted Stiller and fellow screenwriter Justin Theroux spent 10 years writing TT and, in true Stiller fashion, they take the pi## out of everything Hollywood deserves to be hated for and never stop to consider how hard they bite the same hands they've been eating out of for years. I might not love TT, but I definitely enjoyed it and have no problem advising friends to do like the TT tagline says: Get Some.http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Great comedy,"Ben stiller directed a masterpiece!!! Of a movie I'm 14 and I collect movies (mostly comedies) Robert Downey Jr. Went all the way for his role and he was great it's honestly in my opinion in my top 10 greatest comedy movies of all time. This movie made me laugh so hard. I watched this movie well over 10 times. The acting is phenomenal the movies phenomenal. Everything is just phenomenal. This in my opinion is Ben Stiller's best work. Right next to Zoolander. I can watch this movie over and over again, and it will never get old. This fantastic movie will probably go down as one of the greats. A cult classic for sure.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
It's refreshing and funny.,"This movie is very refreshing, because it's a spoofing comedy but not a ""common one"" as SCARY MOVIE, HOT SHOTS, or the awful recent spoofs like DATE MOVIE or EPIC MOVIE. No, this one is original and very well done, because it mixes great jokes (some of them are excellent black humor), good action scenes and critics to the own movies' industry (and also the music industry). All this inserted in a real plot. It's not an amount of pasted spoofing scenes, as some spoofing movies use to be.I liked the story, the acting, the jokes and those trailers at the beginning (in spite of that idea not being so innovative like that. We had seen it before on PLANET TERROR by Tarantino and Rodriguez).About the acting I enjoyed the performances of Ben Stiller, Jack Black (He's completely crazy!...) and Tom Cruise (nice make up).",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

better than I expected,"I don't include plot synopses in my reviews as one can find that information elsewhere. Instead, I concentrate on the all around artistic merits of a film, and the quality of its production.  This was a movie I had to make two passes at.  Normally not a huge fan of silly comedy and instead choosing a more cerebral examples of the genre, I started this movie once in 2008 only to put it down for 8 years until I recently pulled it back off the shelf. While I'm not as frothy in my enamor of this movie as many - and certainly not the buddy with whom I finally watched it on its entirety - I will say that I'm glad I stuck with it this time. And I may not have again has I not had an insistent watching partner. It was obvious quickly both the reason why Robert Downey, Jr received a nod for an Oscar nomination and why he was uncomfortable playing his part in the 21st Century version of blackface. But he pulled it off without, I think, being offensive by poking fun at the type of actor who goes to ridiculous lengths to reach the depths of a particular character. Cruise was brilliant, and I'm nobody who usually gushes about Cruise, though when he is ""on"" I find him terribly difficult to ignore. Stiller is typical Stiller. One always knows what one will get from Stiller, who directed as well. Jack Black was uncharacteristically under- the-top while still playing his guy large. The rest of the cast is rounded out by reliables like Bill Hader, Jay Baruchel and Brandon T. Jackson (hysterically as rapper ""Alpa Chino"".) What struck me over an above the sight gags was the budget they dedicated to the project. Nothing was done inexpensively, a sign of respect for the body of work Stiller is beginning to amass. Not only that but at a 1:47 runtime for the theatrical version and another 16 minutes for Stiller' cut, it's long for a film of its ilk. Look for: a hysterically funny scene in which Stiller has a run in with a Panda, the interaction between Jackson and Downey, Jr., and again, Tom Cruise' priceless parody of film producers...absolutely brilliant. In particular look for the subtle yet unmistakable over sized prosthetic arms on Cruise, as well as the redistribution of his hair from his head to his arms and chest. Again, small things making huge differences.  I'll say I thought it a bit long for my taste - a little slapstick goes a long way for me. But other than that it was hard to complain here.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One of my favorite comedies,"I saw this movie in theatres back in the day, I still watch it to this day, the absolute lack of ideology and PC culture in this movie makes it so refreshing in today's day.This is one of my favorite comedies, the funniest scenes hit every single time I watch it. Did not recognize Tom Cruise the first time I watched it, absolutely love the way he played les Grossman.All actors in this film are carrying their weight. This might be both Ben Stiller and Robert Downey Jrs top ten roles. RDJ actually stays in character through the dvd commentary, but he essentially plays 3 or 4 characters in one at one point.All in all an enjoyable escape.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Unique Comedy With Funny Moments,"Tropic Thunder is not your typical comedy. From the previews you may venture it is merely a spoof on war films, but really it laughs at Hollywood itself. The jokes are obviously from Stiller, with his style firmly attached to the script. And, for a comedy, there were some beautiful filming locations; the filmography was top-notch.Robert Downey Jr.'s performance is simply amazing, feeding off two different cultural stereotypes (african American and Australian). The true scene stealer, however, was Tom Cruise in his disturbing portrayal of movie executive Les Grossman. Stiller also was very good and Black and Nolte had their moments.As with many comedies, this one had its funny moments. Perhaps it could have hit the belly harder with laughs, but it was okay. While I enjoy Matthew McCaunaughey, his performance was not noteworthy, and the film sorely missed Owen Wilson in that role.My recommendation is to wait for the DVD, which will surely be filled with a lot of fun bonus material. In a packed house, this film might be a lot of fun with contagious laughter. I watched during a matinée with practically nobody else in the theater. With that said, I would rate this movie a 6.5 out of 10 stars...no half points in IMDb, however, so a 6 out of 10 stars.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Hilarious, Not Serious, A Good Time","This movie is perfect for what it is, a movie within a movie. Over the top, nonsensical, and funny. Very funny. Something you probably couldn't get away with in this day and age. Which is what makes it as good as it is.Ben Stiller directing it and starring in it goes to show you how not serious it is. It pokes fun at itself, while poking fun at itself. They all do a very good job. The reason it gets this high of a score, is because of how funny it is and how insane of an idea it was for a movie. I had no idea Tom Cruise was hiding in plain sight the whole film as well, unit they tell you during the credits.It gets right to the point and knows what it is. A gag, a goof, funny and entertaining.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Sly Thunder, despite Tom Cruise","Here's the big difference between Ben Stiller and Tom Cruise: Stiller possesses self-awareness, and Cruise does not. Oh, Cruise may attempt self-parody, but he never gives you the impression that he is aware he's making fun of himself - he seems to be saying, ""Hey, I'm an actor, look at me act!"" I've mocked Stiller many times. The guy's a ham, he's a bad actor, and his whiny, petulant behavior in almost every movie is annoying. But he does have a sense of what's funny. For example, when I popped Night at the Museum into the DVD player, I was sure it was going to be full of inept jokes and overexaggerated characterizations, and I was happily surprised, because he was the normalized center of a chaotic maelstrom.And I will further admit that I had reservations about Tropic Thunder as well, since Stiller directed, co-wrote, and coproduced it. This can't end well, I thought, even with Robert Downey, Jr. and Jack Black along for the ride. But it IS good, and for an entirely different reason from Night at the Museum: Stiller, playing an overmuscled action hero, sends up not only the Rambos of the world but also his own high-maintenance, tightly wound on screen (and off) persona. He points and laughs at himself so that we may join in, and that's a level of self-awareness that only those with impeccable comic cred can pull off.The story of Tropic Thunder goes like this. A director (Steve Coogan) of a big-budget Vietnam War movie, tiring of dealing with his prima donna stars (Stiller, Black, Downey, Jr.), allows the grizzled veteran (Nick Nolte) who wrote the book on which the movie is based to move the film shoot to the jungles of Vietnam, where the actors will be dropped to fight the real North Vietnamese in a prime, and punny, example of guerrilla film-making.Apologies for that run-on sentence. Let me put on my Movie Voice-over Guy hat: ""They came from a world in which they held all the cards. Now they find... they're all jokers."" You can't beat Movie Voice-over Guy for plot summaries.Everyone is perfectly cast. Stiller's character is coming off a series of action-franchise movies of declining quality and popularity. Black plays an Eddie Murphy clone in that he's best known for playing multiple characters in flatulence-embracing comedies. Downey, Jr. is an Australian superactor who's won five Oscars and who prepares for this movie by getting controversial pigmentation surgery to look like an African American. I know, I know, it sounds like he's dressing in black face, which is obviously and patently racist, especially in this day and age. Downey, Jr.'s Kirk Lazarus is known as a Method actor, a guy who gets deep, deep, deep into his roles, so he doesn't just walk the walk, he also talks the talk. Dude never breaks character.But this isn't just a high-octane movie with pithy punchlines; it's a raunchy ensemble piece peppered with perfectly knowing, crisp dialog. Black, Downey, Jr., and Stiller all work very well together, and since they're essentially playing actor archetypes, you can easily buy what they're selling.On a hugely positive note, check out the fake trailers before the actual movie of the most recent films completed by the lead actors's actors. On a hugely negative note, check out an almost unrecognizable Cruise as a studio head. Well, unrecognizable until he opens his fat (you'll see) yap. It's a completely pointless cameo that adds nothing to the film, instead distracting and detracting. I don't know who okayed his appearance here, and maybe he thought it would rejuvenate his image a little, but I hope we never have to see Tom Cruise in a fat suit again.But. Leave that aside for a moment. The movie does rock out loud, as the kids used to say, and there's plenty of mayhem, and profanity, and yes, drug humor. I like movies that don't flinch, comedically, from envelope-pushing topics. Each actor plays his role to the hilt - including Matthew McConaughey as a laid-back agent - and, working in unison, they churn out a respectable, clever war comedy. Ignore the critics who say the movie is racist toward black people - it isn't - or that it's hateful toward the mentally challenged - it's not. It's easy to step over the line separating parody from mockery, and this movie dances on the line but never crosses it.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
What's so funny about this movie?,"Here in Israel, most movies have an interval inserted at some point so that they can sell more popcorn. It was significant that several people left at the interval and did not return. My girl friend and I discussed leaving too, but didn't. This movie, and its critics on this website, demonstrates the different perceptions to what is funny and what is not, on different sides of the Atlantic.Yes there are funny moments in this film, some very funny, but not nearly enough in its 107 minutes. It was strangely quiet in the cinema we saw this film in. Perhaps the best fun was trying to work out who was Robert Downey (a great favorite of mine) and Tom Cruise. Others have commented on the story so I won't repeat it.Just be warned. Unless you are a great fan of American humor, you will not find it very funny at all.

goofy but a lot of fun,"Three bankable stars are hired to work on a war movie, based on a book, based on the experience of a former U.S. soldier who served in Vietnam. Stiller is a former A-lister whose career has stalled, Black is a would-be comic with a serious substance abuse problem, and Downey is a five-time Oscar-winning method actor known for going to extremes to perfect a role. Despite their versatility, the film's production is way behind and members of the media wonder whether or not they can complete the project. Out of good options, their desperate director abandons them in a real life 'hot zone' hoping they can learn to work together, but instead they end up fighting for their lives against deadly drug smugglers. Too silly for words—by intention—but made worthwhile by key casting, plenty of hilarious, profanity-laced dialogue, more than enough in-jokes, and amusing gags that rarely let up. Sloppily made, even offensive at times, but good fun for the most part. **½",,Anonymous,Comedy
Crossed the line a few too many times.,"Tropic Thunder is a movie that is at times very funny, but at other times was blatantly offensive. For nearly the first half hour of this film I was hysterically laughing my head off, thinking that it was well on its way to being the comedy of the year, but then began the offensive jokes about people with mental handicaps. I completely felt that these jokes were totally out of line, and just showed poor taste on the filmmakers behalf. You can say that it was all in good fun, but they took it way too far and never tried to redeem what they said. Yes, they made fun of many things in this film, most notably other Vietnam war movies like Platoon and Apocalypse Now, and I loved how they made fun of the Hollywood studio system; and if the film had stuck to those type of jokes, I wouldn't have had a problem with it, and would've thought it was the funniest movie of the year, but instead it traipsed into territory that while may be funny to some, is blatantly offensive for others. Now everyone has their own opinion on this particular issue, so if this issue doesn't bother you you'll love this movie, but if you are offended by this sort of thing you should skip it.Overall Tropic Thunder is a movie with plenty of laughs to be had, but the offensive jokes took me out of the viewing experience and I just never really came back to it after that point. This simple fact lost Tropic Thunder a good number of points in my book.I give Tropic Thunder a 6 out of 10!",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I have mixed feelings about this,"With its wacky trailer, I was really looking forward to Tropic Thunder. My verdict: I have mixed feelings. It's as if a schizo created this flick. When it's funny, it's really funny; but these moments are not sustained (and not in the way where it is poised to just recharge to setup for more laughs). There are (gasp!) draggy parts and the plot refuses to engage the audience, who thankfully snaps back just in time for the punchlines, which border on sick and irreverent.Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller, who also directed and co-wrote the film with Justin Theroux) is a fading action superstar who jumpstarting his career with his co-stars Oscar-winner Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey, Jr.), comic Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black), by going to Southeast Asia to film the ""biggest, most-expensive war movie ever produced"". But when things go wrong (as they often do), they draw on their artistic mettle to do battle as real soldiers when they face a fierce drug ring in the middle of the jungle. Downey, Jr. is the scene-stealer in this flick and spews out more of the wit as a blonde and blue-eyed Australian trying to stay in character to be a convincing black.Also worth noting are the fake trailers at the start of the movie. Matthew McConaughey as Speedman's overzealous agent; Nick Nolte as the badass writer Four Leaf Tayback, on which the movie was supposedly based; and Tom Cruise as the balding, fat but fierce producer Les Grossman are surprisingly hilarious in their supporting roles. Impressively consistent is the talented Brandon Soo Hoo as the scary child-drug-lord Tran. Also watch out for a bunch of cameos from Tobey Maguire, Tyra Banks, Jon Voight, Jennifer Love Hewitt and more.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I could easily tell more, but I don't want to give it away. Ben Stiller was very good, and Robert Downey Jr. was absolutely hysterical. But obviously, the real star of the show was Tom Cruise. He plays a fat, balding, movie producer that says the F word every other word, and he NAILED it. Tropic Thunder is hysterical, and easily the funniest movie of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Hollywood parodies itself and this was absolutely hilarious!,"These past few years we've had a few comedies come out where it does make fun of what Hollywood is today, but they're usually average and get a couple laughs. We now have Tropic Thunder, this movie is a parody of today's Hollywood with random actors in a big movie and succeeds so well with non stop laughs and fun actors. Tropic Thunder is so well put together and was a perfect spoof of the method actor, the comedian, the rapper, and the action star together in a movie, not to mention Tom Cruise, who knew this guy could be so funny? I mean in a movie; but it seems like he had an absolute blast making this movie, everyone looked liked they were having fun and Ben Stiller really did a great job, this was one of the funniest movies I have seen this summer. Coming here on IMDb there were a lot of haters who were just trashing Rober Downey, Jr. and calling this film so racist, after they see this movie, I'm sure their mouths will be shut, because he was the greatest part of Tropic Thunder.Tugg Speedman, the action star, Jeff Portnoy, the comedian, Alpa Chino, the rapper, Kevin Sandusky, the ""and introducing"" actor, and Kirk Lazarus, the method five time award winning actor. These stuck up egotistic actors/wanna-be's are starring in the new big budget Veitnam War movie, but it's not going so well with these guys who can't seem to get motivated. So the director and author of the book ""Tropic Thunder"" take them out to the real jungle of Vietnam, the guys still think they are doing the movie, but what they don't know is that they are being attacked by real terrorists, way to get motivated.Tropic Thunder is seriously one of the funniest movies I have seen in a while, I miss these comedies where the humor is the kind that is just a spoof of real life people. Hollywood today is incredibly ridicules when you think about it and Tropic Thunder just makes you laugh about it. Without a doubt Robert Downey, Jr. stole the show with his controversial character, ""the dude playing the dude disguised as another dude"", going from a white Aussie to a hard core black man, he actually had me convinced, maybe he should be nominated for an Oscar, lol, just kidding, but he was great. Ben Stiller has redeemed himself very much, he hasn't made me laugh so hard since Zoolander. Jack Black was also incredibly funny, I loved his hard core addiction to heroin and how it drove him crazy. I highly recommend this movie, it was so much fun to watch and is guaranteed to have you laughing like crazy.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The curse of 'semi-spoof' strikes again...,"Why do so many Ben Stiller movies, along with Will Ferrell movies, have to be so OTT and goofy?I was cautiously enjoying Tropic Thunder right up until a certain point (about a third of the way in)... As up until then, the film had been entertaining and tongue-in-cheek without being pointlessly wacky But then the 'semi-spoof' tone really started to take hold.Will Ferrell's films are perhaps better examples of the semi-spoof phenomenon though, as they often seem to get stuck between being a decent comedy and a goofy spoof comedy (a spoof comedy like some Wayans brothers drivel) Modern comedy, stuff made for the masses, has a tendency to sink into a swamp of unnecessary silliness...Now, I'm not against OTT scenes in general I like that stuff when it's done well I just hate the way that everything sort of becomes nonsensical by the end of these films- as though having lots of zany antics is the primary goal Good comedies (IMO) are things like Groundhog Day, Trading Places, Midnight Run, Ghostbusters etc etc Films that are very funny but don't make a complete joke of the central concept by repeatedly descending into spoof...As I say, I was really getting into Tropic Thunder as a decent comedy film, especially the dialogue between Stiller and RDJ etc Yet rather than things getting more interesting and characters really getting fleshed out, things just got sillier and less plausible at every turn. In the end, despite lots of potential and some amusing moments, the film wasn't at all satisfying...I know that some people will be thinking to themselves ""But it's a comedy! Just enjoy it!"" Or something But I've already explained why I didn't really enjoy it I want to watch a DECENT comedy for a change! Not just the next in a long line of eye-roll inducing semi-spoofsAnd 'decent' doesn't mean it has to be all straight-laced and meaningful (Happy Gilmore has got lots of silly things in it for instance, but I still enjoyed that) I just mean a funny film that also has a passable story and a consistent tone.I felt Tropic Thunder started out quite strong It seemed funny and 'knowing' sort of like a big budget version of Ricky Gervais' series 'Extras' by the end though, it felt more like Wayans brothers material.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Pain Deep in my Brain,"This movie was written, produced and green lighted on the basis that bad music is better if its loud. The best thing about this movie is ""sympathy for the devil"" in surround sound... awesome. And there were some really pretty shots of Vietnam or say Hawaii wherever it was but ultimately it is flawed by characters who play the script too straight. After watching that movie I felt dirtier than Jack Black's jock strap(which you see several times in slow mo... close up).It has laughs, unfortunately they are as inherently shallow as the characters and script which is portrayed. Don't take your mother, or friend to this movie.Sneak into this movie. and then sneak out.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
It was funny but it lacked the thunder.,"Tropic Thunder was funny, violent and totally offensive and for most of the movie it did work. It was funny but very overrated. There are great performances by all involved. This was one of those comedies where there are totally hilarious jokes and then there are totally painful jokes that belong on Date Movie or Epic Movie.Was it just me or was this movie backwards? Tom Cruise was funny but Jack Black was not. Robert Downey Jr was hilarious but Ben Stiller was not. Isn't it suppose to be the other way around?I do recommend it. Robert Downey Jr totally stole this show. If this doesn't seem like something you would enjoy then i recommend Forgetting Sarah Marshall or Yes Man. I give Tropic Thunder.....7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Very funny movie - slightly over the top humor,"I have no clue where to begin with this review. This movie is one of the most off the wall movies I have seen in years, yet it does have a plot, and a lot of humor mixed in.Without spoiling things, the beginning is very creative, and nothing that you would expect. Once past that, we get into the crux of the movie. Speedman (Ben Stiller) and his crew are in Vietnam, working on a movie based on the book ""Tropic Thunder"" and the director and author of the book are on set the entire time. During one particular scene, Speedman is really fed up with his crew, and wants to do his own thing. So, the crew goes back to where they were dropped off, and Speedman does his own thing. Speedman gets captured by a group of people and the crew through getting lost eventually figure out, we are in a movie and have to follow the script they had to find Speedman.There are so many laughs in this movie, some of it was over the top, but some of it was almost crying laughing. Jack Black plays his usual comedic self, but Robert Downey Jr. does a great job with what his character is. Downey had a lot to deal with, and when you see the movie, you will know what I mean.Some of the music was placed where you wouldn't expect was funny too, some of it original, some of it songs you have heard before. I had not seen the trailer prior to this, which may be a good thing because I am not sure I would have laughed as much. I am very close to saying pay full price for this, but very little of the humor wasn't funny.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I still can't bear Ben Stiller,"When will Ben Stiller realise he is not all that talented. I'm sure he's a nice guy, but, apart from 'Something About Mary' I find him incredibly annoying.However, I liked the look of the trailer and finally sat down to watch this last night, having put it of because of my dislike of Stiller. It's a really good film, great characterisations and the opening sequence is inspired (I want to see 'Satan's Alley' lol) All the performances are great, standout is Robert Downey Jr and Tom Cruise is a hoot as Les Grossman. There are things in it that could be considered disrespectful, Simple Jack comes to mind, but, look at them in context and you can see that they are not meant to offend, but, to illustrate how certain roles win Oscars. The use of the word 'retard' in one scene actually illustrates the ignorance of the characters rather than aiming to offend us, in my opinion at least.There is one gross out scene near the start that I felt was carried a little too far and I could have done without regarding Damian Cockburn, but, aside from that I enjoyed this movie for what it was, no brainer fun that was at the end of the day, a parody.It would have got more points if Ben Stiller hadn't been his usual annoying self.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"it does have its moments and some of its moments are classic, but unfortunately they do not outnumber the defects and flaws","Comedian Ben Stiller seems to be a very popular celebrity amongst people in my age category. Me personally, I think he's a talented comedian in several regards I just wouldn't call him one of my favorites because I haven't seen a single movie with him that I liked or recommend. As an actor, he's good. As a director, he's getting there, but he's not quite there. And that's basically my opinion of his acting/direction job in Tropic Thunder.This cornball action-comedy is about a cast of a war movie (Ben Stiller, Robert Downey Jr., Jack Black, etc) who are dumped in the real war zones of Vietnam and end up actually having to fight for survival, in the weirdest methods possible and the entire time, they are recorded by hidden cameras their unhappy director (Steve Coogan) set up. War veteran Nick Nolte watches from behind the scenes.Now I am giving Tropic Thunder a negative review and I do not recommend it. But I don't abhor the film. I just don't think it's very good. Yes, it has its moments. In fact, it has some classic moments. There were many scenes where I erupted with laughter and I have to give credit to Robert Downey Jr. He stole the show with his performance. The lines they gave him, given to another actor, would have been okay, but Robert Downey Jr. makes it work well. He's the star, not Ben Stiller. Also, Tom Cruise was undeniably hilarious in this film as well. But while there are some moments that did make me laugh and there is some charm in this film, I must admit there are a lot of scenes that do not work as well. Many jokes that weren't funny, many scenes that serve no purpose in the film. As a matter of fact, the pacing is very off. It's too long by about fifteen or twenty minutes. And that is because there are some ludicrous, boring scenes that could not be excised because they play important levels in the so-called ""plot"" of the film. And as for the movie's profanity, it's way over the top.There are some good elements. I liked all of the homage made to Hollywood and classic war and action films and directors and I liked the performances, but ultimately Tropic Thunder fails. It's an okay movie. Strictly okay. Worth seeing once, but not one that I imagine people will be watching over and over again.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Stiller And Black......Fail To .....Deliver,"I read a lot of the IMDb reviewers opinions. What came up again and again was ""I have a problem with Ben Stiller"". This movie is genuinely funny at times. Given the wonderful premise, it should have been VERY funny...throughout. Tom Cruise and Robert Downey Jr. are actors. REAL ACTORS. Stiller, Jack Black are funny guys ??? ..who really don't act very well. Stiller has not learned to stop TRYING to act. Just be yourself Ben....you couldn't act your way out of a paper bag. Jack Black did not do a very good job either. He never appeared comfortable at any stage of the movie. Movie acting is easy (ask Al Pacino). The trick is ..don't try too hard. Downey Jr. and Cruise are ""just fine and dandy"", and looked like they had a ball making this. I have been hearing that Ben Stiller may stick to directing if his new movie ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" is well received. He certainly is not a funny guy....so I hope Mitty does well. Even with the lame duck performances by Stiller and Black....this is still a movie worth seeing. You will L.O.L., but you wont be convulsing on the floor in fits of laughter (like you should have been)------",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Top, top comedy","An absolutely hilarious comedy and parody with actors literally making fun of themselves and their careers. And like a famous person once said, Ben Stiller needs to be made into liquid form so that we could inject him into our veins. The man is simply born funny! And with an all star cast with Robert Downey Jr. (one of his best performances recently), Jack Black, Nick Nolte, Brandon Jackson, and Tom Cruise who puts in one of the most surprising and almost show stealing performances, you can't go wrong. Must see for any fans who have a decent enough sense of humor.And Tom Cruise is still the man. Love him or hate him, one cannot deny that he is still an incredibly talented actor on the stage. I don't pay too much attention to his personal life because I don't look up to the man, but I respect him and still feel he is one of the finest actors in the 90s and he is still putting out great performances these days.",,Anonymous,Comedy
True,"I was lucky to see this film on a special show in Moscow a few days ago and I still with pleasure recall jokes from this brilliant comedy. Stiller managed to create not just a summer adventure comedy, namely a film -domestic product. This is precisely the rare case when the director is to kill 2 hares: to create a comedy for both ordinary spectators and gourmets.The whole film is one big stem over Hollywood. Everything will be ridiculed here, and the love of the Americans for sequels and the Oscar and Schonn Penn, also a parody of military films and much more. An ordinary viewer will simply laugh, and more attentive all these chips will definitely notice. What can I say, Robert Dauni ml. With your stunning dialogs - this is generally one walking stem.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Actors I normally can't stand made a movie I couldn't stand to be without,"Tom Cruise, Jack Black, Ben Stiller. I would never go out of my way to watch a movie just because it starred one of those three. In fact, I would normally avoid watching movies if it starred one of them because I usually just find them too annoying to pay proper attention to the movie itself. However, in Tropic Thunder all three of them put forward performances that had me laughing from start to finish. Especially Tom Cruise, I totally did not expect to enjoy it nearly as much as I did. The plot, script, and acting in this movie are beyond what you would normally expect in a fun summer blockbuster, and with the way comedies seem to be going down hill lately, I think this movie deserves to be remembered as a classic standing above all others. Where as most action/comedy movies tend to focus too much on the comedy and fail to deliver on any serious action scenes (The Other Guys, Pineapple Express) this movie perfectly blends some truly hilarious moments along with amazing set piece explosions and action sequences more befitting a Michael Bay movie. If you haven't already seen this one your missing out and I highly recommend giving it a chance. There hasn't been a better comedy made since this came out over ten years ago now.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
It just didn't appeal to me,"The plot of having actors working on a war movie being put into an actual war zone was a great idea, but I felt it was implemented poorly in this movie and probably shouldn't have been a comedy movie. I just felt that the plot was stupid and lacked intensity. There were a few intriguing moments, but the movie got less interesting as it went on. I would've like to have seen more moments when the cast actually thought they were shooting a fight scene, but it was actually a real fight scene; that would've made the movie more intriguing and probably more funny to me. There were a few funny moments, but not enough and some of them were just stupid to me and not funny at all.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I see everyone crediting Robert Downey JR but I thought he was good but not INCREDIBLE. The cast is stacked with acters from all genres, Tom Cruise is the biggest suprise with him swearing and being fat I mean can it get any better for him. Jack Black is absoluttly great in my opinion and does carry it some times. The reason I would almost give it 6/10 is because I dont think all parts where so funny, up to when the main charachter splits from the unit its great but till the unit comes back for the rescue I think its a bit dull. But still great. Will never watch again. Thanks.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Perhaps it's a little ""too American"" to be really funny for a worldwide audience.","I'm not from the US, but I admit I had a few good laughs while watching this at a theater the other day. But there were just these few quite good laughs, probably not more than five. It made me think that the film is a bit ""too American"", it happened quite a few times when something was supposed to be funny and people didn't take it as such. One good example is the ""DVD comment"" from Downey Jr., people didn't laugh much, probably because they didn't get it. There are more of these examples, but I don't want to mark my comment with spoiler alerts. Or sometimes people laugh at the accent and not at what't actually said.A lot of the jokes get ""lost in translation"" if you are not American and if you read subtitles. The other problem in my opinion is that there isn't a peak laugh, or a really big laugh in the end. Because of that I think a lot of people left the theater a bit disappointed. When I saw such high marks for this film I was a little negatively surprised. It almost seemed to me that I didn't watch the same movie. Some would argue that despite the lack of grand laughs in the end it's ""overall"" funny, but in my view, more mildly.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Horrible Waste of Time,"Out of all the movies i have seen this year only a very few have qualified for my worst films of the year list: Meet the Spartans, 10,000 B.C., The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Hellboy II: The Golden Army, Wanted, and now you can add Tropic Thunder to that list. I don't know what Ben Stiller was thinking but he wasn't thinking clearly. How can you make a movie with this many hateful jokes against the mentally challenged and expect people to laugh. How can you make a movie start off strong and fast paced but then spend an entire hour with side characters wandering around a jungle slowly walking their way towards a drug camp where one of their friends is being held captive? The second act is pathetically slowly paced and brings the film to a complete and total halt. There are good things about the movie like Tom Cruise's amusing part as a sleazeball studio exec and Ben Stiller playing with a real decapitated head even though he thinks it's prosthetic. These two good things are not enough to save it. Overall skip this entirely in theaters and go watch Mummy 3 instead you'll be far more entertained.

Well done Mister Stiller,"I had the pleasure of seeing this fine film today and wanted to set my observations down while they are still fresh. This film has been getting a little bit of ""flack"" for not being politically correct. Actually I find a lack of PC in a film quite refreshing. Yes some are offended by Robert Downey Jr. playing a black man and by the hilarious conversation he and Stiller have about playing a retarded person in a film. My advice is simply leave your brain and conscience at the cinema door and just relax and have a good time. Stiller has been a favorite of mine ever since I saw meet the parents. He has this goofy, everyman quality about him that is perversely appealing. He is wonderful at comedy and I would like to see him do drama. He has had a bit of a turn-down in his career recently and I hope this gets it back for him because he does an awesome job in this film as actor and a very fine director as well. This film is really sort of a satire on hypocrisy. The actors playing macho soldiers who cannot do without their cocaine and cell phones, the so called hero who was a cook in the Coast Guard etc. I also wanted to give kudos to both Robert Downey Jr. and Jack Black. Jack Black has also been a favorite of mine since I saw Saving Silverman. He is talented at both comedy and drama, just look at the great job he did in Shallow Hal. Downey is a true Hollywood comeback story. I am so happy he conquered his personal demons and found its best to get ""high"" in your work. Oh heck, everyone here does such a great job that its hard to tell who steals the show from who. Oh and last but not least lets not forget Tom Cruises hilarious cameo as a foul mouthed studio executive. All in all this is a great film and I give it four stars and two big thumbs up.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Was routing for this movie too bad it did not deliver.,"I don't know if this comedy was just a blend of too many comedians and stars or if the feel of a large production hampered it! The actors not known for comedy also delivered but ya know, it might have been a touch too much to add on. Where there too many egos involved too? (I suppose there is irony if that was the case - given the plot's constant ribbing of insecure actors). I do appreciate what Stiller is trying to do and I think it will be perfected by the next few movies he produces. I just hope that he doesn't find it too exhausting and draining. Keep going you are on the right track. BTW: I'm really impressed with the buff Ben - wow! Overall, good and a couple of strong giggles and laughs, but it just doesn't completely deliver like... like... Something About Mary (there you go - good example).

"Formulaic comedy, but with some brilliant acting","This movie is a typical American comedy - meaning that the plot is completely predictable, it relies on a lot of disgusting visuals and bathroom material for its humor, and many of the jokes fall flat. The reason I rated it as highly as I did is because Robert Downey, Jr. and Tom Cruise, ironically the only NON-comedic actors in the group, are both hilarious. Downey, in particular, as an Australian superstar who immerses himself completely in his role as a stereotypical African-American Vietnam-era soldier, is ingenious in this film. He has some of the most brilliant comedic dialogue I've ever heard. I laughed nearly every time he opened his mouth, as did everyone else in the audience. And Cruise, virtually unrecognizable in his costume, is great as a studio executive who sees himself as a gangsta. Nick Nolte, playing the Vietnam vet who wrote the book on which the film they're making is based, has some great scenes early on. And it's a shame that Steve Coogan exits the story so early on, as he had the potential to bring a lot more to the movie. Everyone else in the cast is pretty average. Ben Stiller is a washed-up action hero trying to save his career, although nothing he does on screen is particularly memorable. Jack Black is a heroin-addicted teen comedy star trying to make it as a serious actor, but unfortunately he isn't given much to do. I don't know what the producers thought was funny about watching a man go through heroin withdrawal for 107 minutes, but Black is never allowed to get beyond that. Jay Baruchel is basically there to play the straight man, while the actual African-American actor, Brandon Jackson, who is given about six lines of dialogue, is clearly only there to ease the producers' conscience about having a White man in blackface in their movie. Matthew McConaughey, as Stiller's agent, is only there as eye candy for the ladies (and to provide an unlikely deus ex machina at the movie's climax). There's not much else to say about this movie - the plot is trite and ridiculous, although film buffs who, like me, are burnt out on Vietnam films will appreciate the many references to ""Platoon"" and ""Apocalypse Now,"" some of which are quite subtle.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

For those who wants to know what Tom Cruise did, i'll give you two big words: FREAKING HILARIOUS!! He was absolutely crazy and had me falling out of my seat every time until his role came to a close!!! And for Brandon T.

"Ben Stiller's Hollywood satire fare is subversive and audacious, yet wildly funny","Ben Stiller's Tropic Thunder is a comedy that opens the door to arguably the most clever and groundbreaking spoof of Hollywood politics ever to put to film. This action comedy hybrid makes the score not solely on outrageously belly laughs, but tackling original ways on poking fun at the extravagant world of Hollywood and perhaps the entertainment business itself. Director and actor Ben Stiller serves as the hefty hand for bringing this subversive comedy to life in ways that without a doubt questionable and have stirred up a fair amount of controversy. At the same time, he makes an inspiring achievement at bringing birth to one of the most audacious, yet funny comedic vehicles in recent years. Opening up with fake four trailers introducing the four main characters each as Hollywood actors, this movie follows the story of a film crew lead by English filmmaker Damien Cockburn (played by Steve Coogan) who must lead a group of prima donna actors including: Tugg Speedman (played by Ben Stiller), a Sylvestor Stallone-like action star, Jeff Portnoy (played by Jack Black), a comedic star of a popular comedy franchise known for flatulence jokes, rapper Alpa Chino (played by Brandon T. Jackson), Kirk Lazuras (played by Robert Downey Jr.), an Austrailan actor undergoing a controversial blackface make-up alteration to portray an African-American soldier, and Hollywood newcomer Kevin Sandusky (played by Jay Baruchul). These actors are making a Vietnam War movie based on the memoir by U.S veteran John Fourleaf (played by Nick Nolte). Frustrated by the actors' incompetent acting skills, Cockburn is adviced by Fourleaf to drop them into the the jungles of Vietnam where they are forced to rely on their acting talent to survive against a dangerous Vietnamese drug cartel.This satirical action comedy operates not only as a near-endless cornucopia of raunchy sex jokes and snappy comedic dialogue, but also a fresh source of smart (and hilarious) spoofs of popular war movies. Opening up the story is the characters in their fictional acting forms performing a gruesome, yet appropriately unrealistic combat sequence pays a sweet homage to Oliver Stone's 'Platoon'. While the special effects including explosions going off and the sight of an actor disemboweled by an Vietnamese bayonet serve as shocking eye meat, the humor is what sets the tone of the story. From there on, the plot settles in with the lead characters dropped off in the jungle of Vietnam where their filmmaking experience turns into a dangerously real 'Apocalypse Now'-like adventure with plenty of snappy meta humor and social commentary of the showbiz thrown around and about. Although Ben Stiller is not well-known for pushing the envelop with audacious humor, he manages to stretch the boundaries with character sporting dubious tropes that very few (if any) cinematic entries are capable of even getting away. One of the attention-grabbing is his character Tugg Speedman's loathed portrayal of a mentally impaired farmer named in a film within the film 'Simple Jack' which has raised the eyebrows of many including the mentally handicapped community. Though some will be able to engage in the satirical purposes behind this fictional figure, there is a certain level of offense that shouldn't be ignored. Another questionable of course, would be Robert Downey Jr. playing a race- altering role in the form of blackface that while adds to some witty satirical commentary, can also be seen as a rather bold move.Ben Still makes an astounding achievement of assembling an overwhelmingly inspiring cast to the screen, blending the crowd with some comedic veterans and more dramatic actors. And joining the ensemble cast is director Ben Stiller himself as the main character Tugg Speedman, who serves as an action star drawn as a homage of Sylvestor Stallone in the popular 'Rambo' franchise. Stiller breaths plenty of charisma and comedic fever into the role, it is hard not to admire. Grabbing the public attention is Robert Downey Jr. playing an African-American soldier who suits as an opposite of his real-life caucasian persona (both within and outside the film). Downey proves himself charismatic in the role, and brings major appeal to his otherwise controversial character. Jack Black, stepping the role of a Chris Farley-like comedic star, adds some good comedic touch as does Brandon T. Jackson as the Ludicrous-like Hip-Hop star. Jay Barachul is good, but brings nothing truly memorable due to the limit in which this character is written. Danny McBride as the pyrotechnics operator does his job here. Playing Speedman's agent is fellow Matthew McConaughey is makes a surprising on screen presence. But arguably the most shocking performance displayed on screen as Tom Cruise who sports a bald cap and fat suit to portray a foul-mouthed studio executive who goes trigger-happy with sprouting F-bombs every minute he's on screen. While his performance does shine, the biggest shocker is learning who is the character is as his bald cap and fat suit render him completely unrecognizable, especially as the actor is somewhat of a stranger in the comedic territory.Tropic Thunder is a wildly entertaining take on Hollywood satire, generated with outrageous laughs and powerfully appealing performances an inspiring cast. At the very best, the film marks not only an exhilarating entry in the comedy genre, but also an inspiring demonstration at Ben Stiller's directing chops. This movie doesn't hold back on being wildly irreverent and audacious with humor, but that's the good news.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Great Movie,"Rating: 9.1
Overall, a movie that is iconic for its edgy humor and star studded cast that was able to mock and make fun of the oscars so much that they could build an oscar campaign for RDJ, and actually get him a nomination (something legendary in itself).Great Direction, Very Good to Great Acting (Incredible from Robert Downey Jr., Very Good from the rest of the cast), Great Story (Extremely funny story that is effective satire to a core), Very Good Screenplay (Filled with jokes that are reeks of 00s esque comedy but still very funny and quotable), Plot Structure was simple with very cheesy plot cliches yet still effective at mocking hollywood and oscars, Pacing was good, Build to climax was very good.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Tropic Thunder is Funny For Everyone,"People who are giving this movie bad reviews never should have seen this movie, because the trailer tells you exactly what to expect and the plot isn't meant to be good, that's the point.People getting offended over the r word being used, now that's pathetic. I have many family members who are mentally disabled and I don't at all feel they are making fun of them.They are simply showing what morons these actors are. This movie has tons of laughs for everyone. I saw it with both my parents and my friends. Every time I saw it, the majority of the people in the theater were always laughing.I don't what what the hell people are talking about when they say no one else was laughing. It's complete bull. You'll laugh your pants off.There is some gore and lots of language, but you have to realize that's how men in the service talk. So shut up about how the cursing is very inappropriate. THATS WHY IT'S R!Definitely a movie to see in the theater! More than once too.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Grand Finale to the Age of Parodies,"Tropic Thunder may not be a great movie by general standards but when it comes to the genre of comedy it is pretty far up there. Especially considering that comedies are just not as popular or respected as they used to be. Particularly that of parodies but Tropic Thunder maybe the last successful parody for a long time.The performances all around were just laugh-out-loud hilarious. Ben Stiller of course led the cast. Although I tend to dislike Stiller his performance was not over-acted as he seems to do in many of his movies. Robert Downey Jr. who probably gave the funniest performance or somewhere in the realm of that from the cast of characters. His role as Kirk Lazarus, the 5 time Oscar winner, who then for his next role would play a man of a different ethnicity was humorous enough in itself but his performance took it to another level. His lines were witty, smart and maybe not so smart which combined to make one of the funniest yet gratifying performances I have ever seen. Then of course there was Jack Black who many people felt got the low end of the bargain in terms of screen time in material and that maybe so but he had quite a few moments that made me laugh about as much as any of the other actors did. Then of course there was the many of cameos by widely respected and famous actors. The most impressive one from Matthew McCounagey, Nick Nolte and Tom Cruise was in fact Tom Cruise. He played Les Grossman, a loud mouth conceited producer of the movie that Stiller and company set out to make. His comic timing was simply perfect and was my favorite of all involved. With this performance he might of paved another way to keep his career a success. He is quite a talented actor but still his performance in comedy caught me and probably many other people off-guard. At first the idea of him getting an Oscar nomination seemed crazy but as I think about it there weren't many supporting performances better than his this year.The writing and directing was also done very nicely. Some of the material that was given to the actors to work with was phenomenal especially that of Robert Downey Jr. Of course though the many mockingly made jokes at the Hollywood and the film industry was done in a very nice subtle way, like a true parody should. Also some of the action surprisingly from the movie was done surprisingly well. What was really good though was the casting. Like many other parodies, the art of using the cameo to generate laughter was used very well. The cameos of the many famous actors involved all contributed to the movie, they were not rushed into the movie but used for a purpose.In light of many recent parodies such as Date Movie, Scary Movie etc., it is very obvious that this branch of comedy seems to be dying off in movies. It is very possible that after Tropic Thunder there really won't be another good parody let alone a respectable one. Even without all of that Tropic Thunder is one of the most hilarious movies I have seen in a while and I would say is a must see.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Very funny, and just hand Robert Downey Jr, the Oscar right now!","I'd like to take a moment to suggest the Academy nominate Robert Downey Jr. for Best Actor. Seriously, his performance in TROPIC THUNDER was a comedic masterpiece that deserves recognition and the film wouldn't have been half as fun without him. Oh, wait. Maybe I should review the movie! TROPIC THUNDER is ostensibly a satire of the rampaging excesses of Hollywood and focuses on the making of war movie being shot in Viet Nam that's hampered by a newbie director and its borderline insane lead actors. When the director admits to the film's tyrannical producer that he's lost control of the production, he's advised in very profane terms that the only way to deal with out-of-line actors is to get mean, so, spurred on by a suggestion from the 'Nam vet author of the memoir the film's based on, the director drops the film's five principals off in Myanmar and tells them he's going to shoot a down-and-dirty, semi-improvised bit of footage that'll get the actors back on track putting them to the test in the rough, with minimal crew and supervision. And then the doo-doo hits the fan in all manner of ways, several of which are potentially fatal to all involved.That's really all I can say without giving away the comedic surprises  you'll note I've taken pains not to discuss most of the cast; you'll discover it all for yourself  but I will say that what starts out as a ""Eff you"" to Hollywood turns into more or less a straight-up action-comedy about halfway through the movie, and while it's still quite funny its shift in tone and focus is somewhat strange. But that's not much of an issues when you have Ben Stiller as a clueless action star, Jack Black as a manic and unwillingly detoxing comedy star, and a host of others willing to look and act like complete and total morons and assholes, with Downey's balls-out nutjob Australian uber-thesp who's so ""method"" that he get his skin surgically darkened in order to portray a black character.Affecting a ""ghetto"" accent and rocking a theoretically-scary-to-white-folks facial intensity, Downey's a total pisser from start to finish and I have to applaud him for taking a role that if mishandled could have resulted in him being torn limb from limb by irate black people whenever he set foot out of his house. I swear I haven't laughed at anything so hard in a long time and it should be made clear that this is not a blackface role, but is actually a study of a guy who's completely insane and won't drop character  he states that he's there to make a movie and won't go out of character until he records the DVD commentary  even when the plot takes a scary and incredibly dangerous turn.TROPIC THUNDER is by no means perfect, but it is funny and it gains points for Downey and Ben Stiller's jaw-droppingly un-PC nod to nauseating and offensive allegedly star-making performances that involve actors portraying the mentally handicapped. You've probably heard about the controversy over the film's allegedly insensitive usage of the words ""retard"" and ""retarded"" and the protests over its supposed hurtful and mocking intent, but it's quite apparent that the protesters have not seen the film and are aware of the use of the derogatory verbiage out of context. As used in the movie, the offending terms come from the mouths of people we're clearly supposed to see as clueless, self-absorbed egomaniacal assholes, and the way they use the words paints the users of the terms in a highly unflattering light; the film does not mock the mentally handicapped, but it does mock the insensitive Hollywood jerkoffs who exploit them in order to garner critical kudos by turning in ""sensitive"" and ""heartwarming"" performances in movies like THE OTHER SISTER, RADIO and I AM SAM.So take my word for it and check this one out in the theater. Just make sure you don't miss the coming attraction reels (HINT, HINT).",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Not impressed,"I've been hearing a lot about this movie and although I'm not an avid Stiller fan, I can say I am pro RDJ (since Scanner Darkly) and Jack black has in the past tickled my funny bone.So what the heck, right? I'll just go to the theater, shut off my brain and get some good laughs from some great comediac performances, right? Wrong.Now don't get me wrong. The beginning fake previews were hilarious. But then it just kind of falls off from there. It wasn't offensive. It wasn't stupid either. It was just... un-funny. The jokes fell flat, RDJ fake accents (the Aussie and African) made him inaudible, Jack Black and Stiller had their moments (although Jack had far more than Stiller) but it was still just not enough to warrent my 11.00.Oh. I almost forgot. Tom Cruise dancing to rap music. I know it was supposed to be silly, I know it was supposed to be stupid, but my God... I was truly offended there. I had to look away from the screen before I vomited.So all in all, the movie isn't unwatchable (except for the above mentioned) but wait for a rental and a dateless Saturday night.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Ben stiller and Robert Downey Jr really carried the movie, you can tell how easily the cast bounced off of one another's parts.I think it's brilliant when actors and actresses can make fun of their own industry, it really shows that they have a human side and more importantly a sense of humour.

A Nutshell Review: Tropic Thunder,"First of all, the goodies begin even before the main movie starts proper, with some hilarious fake ads and trailers just like Tarantino and Rodriguez's Grindhouse features which fabricated some material of its own, so don't be a dweeb and be late for the movie.Now that the public service reminder is out of the way, Tropic Thunder managed to live up to its hype, which in my personal opinion is a bit difficult these days because the marketing folks usually put the best bits in the trailers so that there's no more surprises left, or that the narrative actually fizzles out into mediocrity, losing steam halfway through the movie. Thankfully, this movie managed to pace and therefore sustain itself right through to the ending.There were a couple of plus points in the movie that made it rewarding to sit through. First of all, the movie satirizes almost everything that makes up the Hollywood film industry, with some keen poking of fun from the actors to the crew, from agents to the studio executives, not to mention relatively direct spoofs of Vietnam War movies like Platoon and Apocalypse Now.Then you also have the ensemble characters who add plenty of dimensional flavour and brought to life by their respective cast. Typical characters for ensemble movies get included , ranging from the action hero, the comedian, the character actor, the rapper turned actor and the newbie teenager on the cusp of his first big memorable break. While the keyart might have only Stiller, Downey Jr and Black on its marquee, the supporting roles and cameos also earn as much respect in delivering this movie, especially an almost unrecognizable Tom Cruise, who dons a bodysuit to hide his pretty boy looks (not the first time he's done in, ala Vanilla Sky), and possessing the rare gift of incessant swearing which I haven't seen him do since Born on the Fourth of July.His character, sleazy studio executive Les Grossman, gets my thumbs up for lighting up the screen each time he's on, and probably had single handedly stole the thunder (pardon the pun) from the main leads, which I thought director Ben Stiller had realized the campiness of this role, that he decided it should be milked a lot more. While he plays against type, I doubt Cruise will get any Oscar nods for this insane role, but there's always MTV to show its appreciation to his madcap antics done right, for a role and not on a couch.Besides his supporting role, there were also others such as Steve Coogan as the rookie English director having to control his prima donna actors, and also to try and keep the movie from spiralling further out of budget and schedule, and Nick Nolte as Four Leaf Tayback, a Vietnam Vet who lost 2 of his hands, whose book the movie Tropic Thunder is based on, given the industry's raid on books and graphic novel material to make movies, if not going down the path of remakes. Look out also for plenty of cameos such as Jennifer Love Hewitt, Alicia Silverstone, Jon Voight, and Tobey Maguire if you're on time to view those fake trailers.And what of the leads? I thought they probably had a good time making this movie, hamming up for their characters and providing some crazy laughs. Ben Stiller leads the team as Tugg Speedman, the action hero who desperately needs a hit to repair his reputation after a disastrous dramatic stint in which he plays the much-frowned upon retarded role of Jack the simpleton. His character is a little of a show-off, and he managed some superb nuances in his persona as the cock-sure action person. Robert Downey Jr plays his opposite number, the exaggerated multiple-award winner Kirk Lazarus who stays in character all the time until the release of the DVD commentary, undergoes a controversial surgical procedure to help him ease into the role, and shares probably some of the best scenes with Stiller in the movie. Move aside Tony Stark/Iron Man, Downey Jr's role here is more memorable!And to round things off, Jack Black got quite muted as the fart-it-all comedian who doesn't feel appreciated and is a drug junkie, Jay Baruchel as the teenage nobody hoping that his role here amongst the heavyweights would get him laid, and Brandon T Jackson's Alpa Chino just cracks me up on his name alone, as the rapper turned actor slyly promoting the beverage he endorses, and has a very fleeting suggestion of homosexuality (somehow the rage these days in comedies?)Definitely justifies its accolades as one of the comedies of the year. Get some!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Ben Stiller film I was waiting for,"Tropic Thunder - Five actors are sent to shoot a war movie in Laos after their film goes over-budget, with the catch being that there are also some gun-toting drug den dwellers occupying the jungle. The bunch is comprised of a normal actor (Jay Baruchel), a rapper/actor named Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson), a comedian (Jack Black) that's an Eddie Murphy/ Mike Myers/ Robin Williams hybrid, action star Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller) who once played a mentally handicapped man to try and get an Oscar, and Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.) who is the sort of extremist method actor Hollywood loves to dote with Oscars, so for this role he has donned blackface.Dear god this movie is funny! Forget just war movies (Though it rips those up aplenty. It riffs Saving Private Ryan, Platoon, countless dying scenes...) this movie delivers Hollywood's head on a stake. Right from the start the movie also spoofs Disaster movies, sequels, lowbrow comedies, and historical films. Tropic Thunder crosses so many boundaries and insults so many people with such skill and humor that it has to be given the highest praise in return. Several insults are only surface deep though. The Association for the Mentally Handicapped has been up in arms about this movie, but if they were to pay close attention, it's really Hollywood's use of these people that the film is spoofing.Ben Stiller is good. It might have actually been funnier if his part was played by Steven Seagal, but that man could never allow himself to be beaten up in a film, or act. Stiller tones down the parts of previous performances I've hated, and keeps the funny parts. Jack Black delivers so many funny lines pitch perfectly as the least likable of the characters. Brandon T. Jackson and Jay Baruchel (who actually did play a mentally deficient person in Million Dollar Baby) provide strong comedic support. But Robert Downey Jr. runs away with the show in a role that should be completely tasteless, wrong, unfunny, and nonexistent. But oh my god if he does not pull it off and steal the show incidentally. He's wonderful. As Kirk Lazarus he almost never breaks the character's character, even when it's clear that no cameras are around. Every other line from his mouth is a gem, and you know some of the lines from this movie will become tired once they're put on T-shirts and quoted by 13-year olds.The writing overall is top notch. I know a movie must be pure awesome when I am loving the performances of Tom Cruise and Matthew McConaughey, two actors I really don't like. Funnier with more bite than Borat.

I am British Black and I really enjoyed this film,"I am British-Black and I really enjoyed this film. It was a satire of how Hollywood portrays various social groups on film and then has the audacity to pat itself on the back thinking it has portrayed these groups of people accuracy and with sensitivity  when the exact opposite has happened! It is also a reflection on how money/profit driven the Hollywood movie industry is, caring more about how much money they can bring in without care or thought to the quality of the end product or to the staff and actors who work on the film. I was not offended because I understood the film and think that all those people who are jumping on the bandwagon claiming this film is offensive are doing it as a way to gain self publicity and don't care that they are raising their profile on the backs of the actors, writers and producers of this movie. Ben Stiller and Co brought a subject to light everyone was aware of in a way that did not preach to people but just highlighted it in the hope it would make everyone first acknowledge it does exist and second have Hollywood think twice about how they choose to portray different social groups. This movie was well directed, produced and brilliantly acted by all principal actors and I laughed in all the right places and ended up thinking throughout that they are so right and truly appreciated what Ben Stiller and Co had done! I rate this film 10/10 because if you think about it this film made Hollywood stand up and really look at itself and it didn't like what it saw!

An Oscar nominated Robert Downey Jr steals every scene he is in!! He is brilliant as method actor Kirk Lazarus, an actor so commuted he does not come out of character until he has done the DVD commentary, and thinks nothing of having skin augmentation for a role!! Ben Stiller (allegedly loosely basing his character on Sly Stallone) is fun, normally I find most of his characters the same, but I like him here. Jack Black is perfectly cast and gets some great one liners.Then on to Tom Cruise, who after a very public kicking from all quarters, he reminds everyone why they like him, with an over the top, energetic and totally off the wall performance that was rightly nominated for a Golden Globe (his last nomination to date) I'm still waiting for the Les Grossman solo movie.Tropic Thunder grossed $110 million at the domestic box office to end 2008 the 25th highest grossing movie of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Hysterical Tropic Thunder,"Brilliant Robert Downey Jr. as 6 time Academy Award Winner Australian actor Kirk Lazarus, who has physically altered himself to play African American character Linc, says, ""I don't read the script. The script reads me!"" Confused fellow actor Kevin Sandusky (excellent Jay Baruchel) exclaims, ""What do you mean?"" Writer and Director Ben Stiller's ""Tropic Thunder"" is absolutely hysterical, and is the funniest movie of the year. With the screenplay by Stiller, Justin Theroux and Etan Cohen, from the story by Stiller and Theroux, ""Tropic Thunder"" is among the funniest and clever movies ever made. The work alone by Robert Downey Jr. as acclaimed actor Kirk Lazarus and the almost indistinguishable Tom Cruise are beyond praise and totally off the hook. There is a scene where Downey as Australian Lazarus, playing a Black man, is disguised as a Vietnamese speaking Mandarin. No wonder even Lazarus is confused saying: ""I know who I am! I'm the dude playing the dude disguised as another dude!"" No more shall be revealed about Cruise's role. Needless to say it is comic genius.Director Ben Stiller generates amazing performances from his lead actors including himself, Jack Black, Downey, Brandon T. Jackson, and Nick Nolte. But the surprises are the big name supporting actors like Matthew McConaughey as Tugg's agent Rick Peck and of course Tom Cruise. ""Tropic Thunder"" will offend virtually everyone, and every group of people. Stiller and crew have written bold biting comedy blind to elements of conventional taste that mercilessly mocks the egos at play in the world of celebrity and entertainment.""Tropic Thunder"" is about a movie within a moviewell, for the most part. In ""Tropic Thunder"" overwhelmed movie director Damien Cockburn (wonderfully scattered Steve Coogan) is charged with making the Vietnam War picture ""Tropic Thunder"". ""Tropic Thunder"" is based on the book by wounded Vietnam vet Four Leaf Tayback (completely out there Nick Nolte). Damien (Coogan) is charged with the nearly impossible task of filming this movie with a cast of ""prima donnas"". Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller) is the washed up action star seeking to revive his plummeting career. Kirk Lazarus (Downey) is the Oscar Winner Actor, who remains in character until he does the narration for the DVD release. Lazarus also underwent a controversial procedure to look like the African American sergeant he plays in the movie. Rapper Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson) is the Chris Ludicrous-like character crossing over from hip-hop to acting. Jeff Portnoy (crazed and funny Jack Black) is the comedic star, whose claims to fame are movies about flatulent characters. Portnoy is also a big time coke addict. Kevin Sandusky (geeky funny Jay Baruchel) is the young actor with his big break. After 4 days of shooting ""Tropic Thunder"" is something like $100 million dollars over budget according to ""E!"" Under mounting pressure from his producer, Damien (Coogan) follows the whacked out recommendation from Tayback (Nolte). Damien basically high jacks his actors into the jungles of Vietnam to film his greatest war movie ""guerilla style"". Predictably something goes very wrong. What follows is hilarious comic mayhem. Ben Stiller has the toughest role, because his Tugg is a complete idiot. To his credit he doesn't get smarter. It is only through Stiller's charm and support by Downey, does Tugg become sympathetic.The controversy surrounding the characterization of the mentally disabled or handicapped, is warrantedI suspect. The inappropriate vernacular is used. However, in context the target is really the skewering of narcissistic method acting and actors. In the exchange Lazarus (Downey) advises Speedman (Stiller), ""Never go full"" This is a well written piece about Oscar politics and what lands with an audience involving Hoffman, Hanks, Sellers, and Penn. The arc for this narrative thread is not smug or cruel. We do live in interesting times.Robert Downey Jr. is an amazing talent. As Kirk Lazarus, Downey demonstrates that he can do virtually anything on screen and just kill. Even as out there as his character Lazarus; he can generate insight whether it is his conversation about ""Simple Jack"" with Stiller or when he says to Jackson's Alpa Chino, ""We cool?"" Downey enrolls an authentic presence in the most warped contexts. Stiller grounds his Speedman in compassionate stupid. As director Stiller delivers his talented cast on deadly comic ground. ""Tropic Thunder"" is smart, offensive, and will make you laugh out loud.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Hilarious Satire, An Instant Classic","This movie is brilliant and funny on many levels, and its one of the few comedies i can watch over and over and not get bored of. For one, i'm not usually one who likes Ben Stiller movies but he was actually pretty good in this one. The best acting by far was Robert Downey Jr. who's practically unrecognizable but a riot all the way through. Playing an Australian actor who's playing a black soldier, who's criticized by the other black actor for being far too stereotypical who can't recognize he's basically a walking stereotype himself. And then there's the whole identity crisis he and Stillers characters go through, just great. The characters in this movie are awesome, especially Tom Cruise who plays a character so off the vein of his typical roles but totally nails it. I think he should play corrupt assholes more often, it may be my favorite role from him yet. The dysfunction between everyone is just comedy gold, and they fail to make a movie so perfectly that it just spirals out of control.Oh and did i mention this is all happening in the middle of Asian territory run by heroin growing drug overlords?

"Hilarious, Smart, Offensive - And I Loved Every Minute of It","Let me set up some stats first. I'm a girl, and I found this movie to be hilarious. I don't get why people keep saying that this is just a guy movie. Sure, the only speaking part for a woman in this movie is Ben Stiller's wife, but it doesn't matter. The movie stands as a hilarious take on Hollywood actors determined to change their images or win an Oscar.I loved it the first time I saw it, and the second time (24 hours later). Since then, I've seen it over 10 times (bought the directors cut - which is totally worth it) and it's STILL funny. It's a true gem of a comedy in this period of truly awful spoofs. This is satire going back to the days of Mel Brooks, but tweaked. Ben Stiller worked on this movie for over 10 years, and his hard work shows. The editing and directing are fantastic, as well as lighting and sound. The tech and acting aspects are all here to create a wonderful comedy that is not clean of fun for the whole family.Downey - impeccable as usual. Spot on without being distasteful, and funny beyond reason.Jack Black - His role is so understated in this film. He's funny in every scene he's in. He deserves more credit.Stiller - You can see his passion for this movie and his role in every scene he's in. He acts everything with care and consideration for his character.Jay Baruchel & Brandon T. Jackson - Two unknowns who really shined in this movie as the unknown theater school grad and multi-franchise rapper respectively. They're hilarious actors that have moved on to bigger comedies, but this is by far their break out movie.Go see it. Rent it. Steal it from a friend - just watch it.

At least they all stretched their limits a bit (Meant with the most sarcasm I can type with.) Luckily Jay Baruchel and Brandon T. Jackson provided some nice fill in roles to counter the so called Super Stars. Matthew McConaughey was OK in his role as well, all in all i would say this was as big a waste of comic talent I have seen in years.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Utterly Hilarious,"One movie you owe yourself to see , laughs all the way. The best part is the stellar acting by the well --""actors"" , Stiller and Downey Jr are at their best but my vote goes to Downey Jr who stole the show. I was completely unaware that the Iron Man guy was capable of such a high class comedy. The plot is also unique (a war comedy setting) and well thought off. Some of the scenes are so funny , I still get a hearty laugh replaying after having seen the movie. I wish they continue to make such movies in the future. Best watched with friends , this is a guaranteed to tip you off the seat. Tom Cruise's portrayal of media mogul is a class act in fact I hadnt bothered to go through the cast before watching the movie and was wondering later on who was playing the media mogul role !!",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"You'll laugh. You'll hate yourself for it, but, you'll laugh.","This movie has a fantastic premise. That, along with a STELLAR (Stiller?) cast, some ludicrous moments, memorable and quotable lines, makes this an instant cult classic.It's quite raunchy, so if that is a turn-off, best avoid this film. But this is one of those movies where it feels like a bunch of A-listers got together to make a funny, shocking, entertaining movie, and have just as much fun filming it as the audience has watching it.It's got heart, everybody put their ""all"" into it. We get fantastic performances, rich cameos, and you gotta appreciate where they go in this movie.It's good stuff. And I bet you'll never look at Jack Black the same ever again.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Too politically correct to be truly memorable,"I was highly anticipating this film - after seeing an extended trailer, it seemed that for the first time in some years, a comedy with real intelligence and bite was being foisted upon us. I missed it in theaters, but grabbed it on DVD.I was initially positive about it, but after a retake, I broke down. It's certainly well-mounted with great production values and good performances, but loses its way in the overt attempt to entertain and hand-hold the audience that dooms most foul-mouthed comedies to unmemorable mediocrity. Too many parody and satire sequences are played so broadly that one laughs at the spectacle rather than the subtle jabs that really could put it above most junk out there.And that's really a shame, because I've seen it all before, and more importantly because Stiller and company just nail it in a few small truly memorable exchanges, most of which include Robert Downey, Jr. People describe the obvious ""Heart of Darkness"", ""Platoon"", and ""Rambo"" references, but the script quotes and alludes to so many films, producers, and actors that it's a virtual beehive of smack.To put it succinctly, I think that Stiller and Company wanted to make a sharp, biting satire on the business, but felt the need to couch it in a typically raunchy, pedestrian framework in order to bring in the largest possible audience (and the largest cash flow).And what's left? Just F-bomb country and small organ mentality, particularly from that hog of a Jack Black. All of this is a bit too politically correct for me, and therefore, in a sense, the film parodies itself. Upon reflection, I can only give it a 3 out of 10 simply for the exchanges between Downey and Stiller.It's not too hard to imagine that Downey could receive an Oscar nomination for this because that's what the world of film has come down to - a world where subtlety and thought is drowned in frantic excess.",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Awesome movie,"Just to start off this movie was awesome the story line was great the actors were great and funny throughout the movie. The One thing that I do not like about this movie was the foul language, but in some places in the movie to make it funny they needed bad language. In the beginning of the movie was awesome , funny, gets u excited about the movie another thing that I love is that the gore and the blood was funny in this movie.The scenes, the jokes were all great too . Ben stiller did a good job of directing this film I'm now watching more and more of his films this movie is recommend for people who have swearing and funny gore as there humour to like this movie.

A MUST watch movie!,"I saw this movie yesterday with my friend. This movie is just flat out amazing! Me and my friend were laughing from beginning to end, for me this is a must watch movie. The comedy in this movie is flat out genius, and the characters are so interesting and so well acted. This is a Ben Stiller movie, I would say this is one of his best movies he has ever done. The actors in this movie are just so perfect (especially Robert Downey JR) but I would say all the actors made a great job, Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Matthew McConaughey, Tom Cruise and Brandon T Jackson just to name a few.

"Appropriate or not, it's really really funny!","I appreciate this one because from the beginning of the movie it gives people a clear idea of how chaotic the story is going to be, you don't need to take anyone seriously but they are all likable, you like them even more because how they finally connect with each other, a bunch of people who can't stand each other try to make things together.Some people may not think its joke is appropriate, but it also let you know it's not the point, every conversation is like a honest gossip in clever way, when it's honest, it becomes insightful.

It was so Awesome that everything around this movie became Awesome!,"I don't know how to start this review as I just finished watching Tropic Thunder, and I think I just saw the best comedy movie ever...Anyways, All actors amazingly were good. Usually In almost all movies one or two actors steal the show. However, In this movie everyone was amazing. Boy even Tom Cruise. I've always thought that Ben Stiller made this movie probably because he was A DYING STAR. But In the movie he became a legend, and apparently he became also a legend in reality. I still remember watching his movies they were funny but they were silly and below average. On the other hand, here he directed and wrote and managed ( Super Stars) like Tom cruise, Robert Downey Jr, Jack Black, Matthew McConaughey and he managed himself to be a superstar.Probably my review is as stupid as this movies plot but who cares, In this movie i saw all my favorite actors and they were all awesome, and fun.If you have the chance to watch this movie DO IT as soon as possible because I think this movie really should be submitted to an Oscar nomination.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Tropic Thunder is a movie about a movie playing another movie,"Apparently, Ben Stiller met actors who were in Platoon and talked about it like they'd been to war, and that struck him as ridiculous and many years later, he helped turn that thought into a war movie.Tropic Thunder is basically a self-aware action-comedy, a satire on the vanity of movie actors. Its easy to misjudge it, I've found. On first viewing, I just didn't think there were enough jokes. Its a strange animal because it has its feet equally in the action and comedy camps. Its almost as much about becoming the thing, as it is about satirising it. The movie I think is interesting in the way it pushes through the meta stuff to get to some kind of reality. It would make a good introductory text for a class on the nature of truth and reality, if not for how easily misunderstood its dialogue about race and disability groups are. While its clear to me that the intention is to make fun of movie actors at all times, I can understand how some people might have felt the movie was irresponsible in its messages with the ""Simple Jack"" storyline and the blackface storyline.I know Downey Jr. was conflicted about accepting the role of a method actor who gets so immersed in his role as a black seargent that he can't drop character, but I'm glad he did accept it, because he's hilarious. He steals every scene he's in. As does Tom Cruise, who many didn't recognise until the closing credits, back in the day. Some of the team players get forgotten. Jay Baruschel is an excellent straight-man. He's the character we relate to, the one actor who hasn't been swallowed up by vanity. Jack Black also has a bit of a thankless job. He's unpleasant as the Fatties star, unpleasant as the drug addict, and has one hilarious scene when he's tied up to the tree. Steve Coogan also has an important part, and he plays it well.Back in 2008, I was expecting maybe Zoolander or Anchorman, which have maybe 50% more jokes. Tropic Thunder is a different animal. Its a bit more measured, but its way more exciting and immersive than any of the other over the top comedies it gets lumped along with.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One of my favorite comedy's,"Tropic thunder is Ben stiller's best movie with amazing performances from everyone (stand outs are jack black, Tom cruise, and especially Robert Downey jr.), hilarious comedy, some good action, a fun to watch villain, a great end credits sequence, and story and characters that are engaging to watch. Such a funny film that you need to watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Worth watching for Robert Downey Jr alone,"It seems to me that nearly every other comedy at the moment is a sex comedy that is either produced or written by Judd Apatow or it stars Seth Rogen . I don't have too much of a problem with that as they all tend to be quite funny but for how long? Luckily Tropic Thunder bucks that trend and we have a comedy that is not only different but is very funny too.Ben Stiller plays pampered action superstar Tugg Speedman, who is cast in the biggest, most expensive war movie ever produced. He sets out to Southeast Asia with a ""Who's Who"" of celebrity co-stars. They include Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.), an intense, three-time Oscar(R)-winning actor; Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black), star of the popular gross-out comedy franchise ""The Fatties""; multi-platinum hip-hop-star-turned-entrepreneur-turned-actor Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson); and first-timer Kevin Sandusky (Jay Baruchel). Soon after the production begins the actors are thrown into a real-life situation and are forced to become the fighting unit they're portraying, in order to find a way out of the jungle in one piece.Is there a more versatile actor around at the moment that Robert Downey Jr.? If there is i cant think of one. Despite his well publicised problems in the past he has come back with a vengeance and the diversity of rolls he picks has to be admired . From Chaplin to Iron man everything he does seems to work , but he has outdone himself here as the Australian method actor Kirk Lazarus who has a skin pigment operation to turn himself into an African American so as to immerse himself into the role He is quite Brilliant and makes this film worth watching on its own.Apparently he had some reservations about taking the part in case it would offend. I'm so glad he decided to do it.As Kirk Lazarus says ""I know what dude I am. I'm the dude playin' the dude, disguised as another dude! "" There are also some superb comic performances from Tom Cruise and Ben Stiller . You have to check out the final credits when Cruise's Character , Les Grossman , is dancing to gangster rap , Priceless.Basically this movie is one big micky take out of Hollywood and it's actors and i admire Director Ben Stiller and the cast for going along with that.I really enjoyed Tropic Thunder and although it does get a little silly at times the brilliant script and the first class comic acting make this a film not to be missed.8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The majority of you have been severely mislead.,"Im shocked at the amount of utterly pompous critics on here who cite this film as a clever satire and flamboyantly chant 'I get it because I'm better than anyone else'.Ironically, the joke is on them.I understood all of the references to much better films like 'apocalypse now', 'the deer hunter', 'Platoon' and even 'forest gump' (I never thought i would say that). I even chuckled to myself in a sense of turgid superiority for 'getting' it at the start of the film.But as the film progressed there was simply nothing there to suggest that the makers of the film were superior to the 'Hollywood' they were satirising. No sharpness or accuracy.Although they try to cover it up by adding the confusing and detrimental 'film within a film within a film but not really' aspect, its still clear what they've done.They've made a bad, cliché ridden film and ingeniously called it a satire to cover their tracks. Doing so doesn't make the filmmakers superior to their work or their work superior. Being told that the film was a 'satire' doesn't soften the fact that I've sat through over 90 minutes of typical Hollywood garbage.It startles me how many people are sucked in by this.(if you are wondering about why i didn't rate it lower, the acting wasn't to blame, and the film started strongly before descending into madness (hint of apocalypse now there? ahh the irony).",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Amazing action/comedy movie,"At first I was impressed with the effects and stuff and said to myself after 10 min this is it the moment to start to be boring and bad comedy. The movie totally showed me wrong being one of the best this year in my opinion. Robert Downey Jr. was fantastic in his character and I will never manage go behind his cover if not being catch on guard by the trailer. Ben Stiller was a great action director and the music was really good for the scenes i hope i see him doing a real action movie, I think he was great to deliver a satisfying movie.

Satire at its finest,"One of the funniest comedies I've ever seen. I was expecting the usual kind of Zoolander/Dodgeball slapstick humor that Stiller is famous for (which I also enjoy greatly, might I add), but this was a tad bit more intelligent than his normal fare. Plenty of stupid one liners, but it mixes in some terrific satire as well. The movie trailers in the beginning were PRICELESS. Robert Downey's character is one of the funniest I have ever seen.However, this movie isn't for everyone. As with most Stiller movies, it will appeal to younger audiences MUCH more than older audiences as there is still plenty of ""childish"" humor in it. Still, everyone should watch this movie, because there's an excellent chance that you'll get some laughs out of it.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Quite simply a riot,"I'm just gonna come right out and say it, ""I loved this movie!"" I laughed consistently through the whole thing and at the moment it's one of the funniest movies I've seen in quite some time.Who better to write and direct a movie about Hollywood and its eccentricities than Ben Stiller, a guy who grew up in the fold with actor parents? If you've seen the trailers you know the story. A handful of troublesome actors are dumped in the middle of Vietnam by their director in an effort to scare worthy performances out of them with guerrilla style film making tactics. What you don't see is the fact that in spite of the film being set mostly around the main actors in the jungle, the entire film industry is skewered right down to the last key grip. Agents and producers fight over whether to favor money or common human decency. Actors argue over method. An effects guy is just plain insane. And the war vet who wrote the source material for their production is just as crazy as the drug dealers our heroes run a foul of. Every actor, including the many cameos spread among the celluloid are at the top of their game. People who like to laugh should be easily entertained here and anyone who has ever watched a behind the scenes documentary may very well bust a gut before it's half over.As for the controversy behind this. Don't peg it before you've seen it. The use of the word retard should not in anyway be construed as offensive in this film. They are making fun of people(especially Hollywood's) perception of the mentally challenged. That's the whole point of the movie. The same point made with Robert Downey Jr. in black face. The movie is poking fun of its own industry...and industry with a dubious reputation for the amoral and misinformed. That's why this is classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Tropic Blunder...dumb as hell.,"The only redeeming thing about this movie is Robert Downey Jr.'s performance. His black character was so unbelievably stupid, I laughed despite myself. The rest of the movie is painful. And there was so much hype about Tom Cruise playing a fat comic role, but alas, it's the same old Cruise acting like an asshole - except he's fat and bald. Everyone screams in this movie, the whole time as if Stiller was on cocaine when he wrote it and the actors did a few rails too before each take. The lines in this movie are exceptionally stupid, contrived, and the comedy is way over cooked. None of the gags were funny because you could see the punchlines coming from miles away. The opening scene is too long, and so is the blown off hands gag. All the jokes are begging for a laugh like a homeless bum pleading for a quarter. Tropic Thunder is a true stinker.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
An Experiment in Winning Satire!,"Tropic Thunder is a film that understands biting satire. It sets out to villainize the very people that made the film possible. It understands parody and it understands good comedy and delivers consistent laughs throughout. It starts out with a promising bang and from there, continues to revel in its absurdity and wit. The script is sharp and provides a great basis for the humor that spurs the film on, however, it's truly the actors that take it to the next level. Robert Downey Jr's performance as the lost Australian actor is perhaps one of the most standout performances in a comedy. Not only that, but Tom Cruise's Les may just be the engine that brings this film home. Its both ridiculous and a furnace of hilarity. But in all truth, the chemistry within the rest of the cast is undeniable. I would have to caution viewers, this film may not be what you're expecting. Ben Stiller's previous films and even his own written ""Zoolander"" are quite different from the tone and the visuals of Tropic Thunder. And its not just in the profanity or utter gore, its within the concepts behind the film. It dares to go into areas that are politically incorrect and what say may even find on the offensive side. Its not afraid to traverse the areas outside of hands-off comedy. Like I said, this could be satire at is very best, and its got the cast and the laughs to prove it. If you're a fan of balls-to-wall, brazen comedy that isn't afraid of the lines, this will be your cup of tea. You'll be laughing from start to finish and reveling in the ride. It's fresh and that originality carries it somewhere great. There is a total lack of predictability and its shies away from the clichés and THAT is something I think a lot of films haven't been ballsy enough to do.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A terrific Hollywood spoof and blend of comedic styles,"We've seen plenty of Ben Stiller comedies, we are very familiar with Jack Black's sense of humor and if you've watched a fair share of movies (including ""Iron Man""), you know how good Robert Downey Jr. can be, but never before have you seen them like this, teaming up to create summer 2008's best comedy. ""Tropic Thunder"" is not a violent action comedy like it lets off--instead the gun is aimed at Hollywood, taking shots at actors, writers, producers, the whole lot as they try and make a Vietnam War film. It's not the most laugh-out-loud funny comedy in recent years, but its combination of great and diverse talent playing a variety of amusing characters and clever Hollywood-spoofing jokes makes it a unique brand that is familiar but fresh.""Tropic Thunder"" is a new war film based on a book written by a war vet played by Nick Nolte. The film brings together action star on the decline Tugg Speedman (Stiller), drug- addict comedian Jeff Portnoy (Black) and over-dedicated several-time Oscar winner Kirk Lazarus (Downey Jr.) who has undergone surgery to become black for the film. The film brilliantly starts with three trailers from their previous work, the funniest being ""Satan's Alley"" starring Lazarus and Toby Maguire as gay monks.With cast and crew unable to gel on set and receiving terrible publicity with the threat of being shut down, their director (Steve Coogan) agrees to send the actors into the actual Vietnamese jungle and film them guerrilla style. Only it all goes wrong and it quickly isn't a movie anymore.Directed by Stiller himself and written by him and lesser known actor Justin Theroux, there is definitely a sense that the film centers around Stiller's character and his style, but this is definitely all about the coming together of Black, Stiller and Downey Jr. along with some familiar but smaller names from Apatow Productions like Jay Baruchel of ""Knocked Up"" and Danny McBride from ""Pineapple Express."" Britain's Steve Coogan is transitioning nicely to America as the film's aggravated director and Tom Cruise takes a bold risk as the film's self- centered, foul-mouthed producer.Downey Jr. steals the show. He's playing an Australian who is playing a black man and stays in character at all times--it's ridiculous. You believe it so easily. His style really freshens up what could have become just another Stiller movie. Cruise, while not hysterical, really leaves you asking if that's him the entire time, because he really transforms for the role and not just in being bald and fat. The performance definitely gets props.It's the spoofing that really does it, though. While viewers may see red flags with the warnings about insensitivity toward people with mental disabilities and with Downey Jr. in blackface, you can pretty clearly tell why and it's not to make fun of either group. All the main characters basically make fun of actors with their descriptions: Stiller is like a dumb Tom Cruise, Black is a drug-addicted Eddie Murphy type, Downey Jr. is a pretty clear shot at Russell Crowe, etc. The plot is loaded with more cracks as well as some other clever humor and jokes. The film is also not bad as an action film with plenty of explosions.There might be some jokes that don't work, but there's lot of different jokes in this movie because of the variety of comedians in it, so if something misses you're sure not to see the same type of jokes following it up. The general tone, however, is crude humor and that's where the R rating comes in. There is also a decided lack of female actors in this film, which gears it pretty much for guys only. This is a fun movie though and is sure to lead to more Hollywood-spoofing films in the future should it pull at the box office.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

My opinion on the movie and all those 'Communities' complaining about it!,"Tropic Thunder is one of the best comedies ever!Period.I have to admit that i had a very high expectation's for this movie since some of my very,likable actor's are acting in it!Such as Nick Nolte,Ben Stiller,Jack Black,Robert Downey...Oh yeah,Tom Cruise and Matthew McConaughey too!Just take a look at the cast.Would those actor's really acted in some movie if they'd thought it's not worth it?I don't think so!The cast alone tell's you how good movie this is! I must say that i was really surprised by Robert Downey.If there weren't Heath Ledger,he would of won the Oscar.This is Robert Downey's best role so far.He was even better then in Chaplin.He acted this role better then Denzel Washington him self,would of! Nick Nolte was also great.As alway's of course an i want even speak of Tom Cruise,who was truly excellent.Too short the story,everyone was great! Another thing that's great,maybe even Oscar nomination worthy,is direction.Ben Stiller really did it this time.He really outmatched him self.I must say that this is not the kind of movie everyone will like.This is a kind of an intelligent comedy.Don't get me wrong,i'm not trying to disrespect anyone or say that i liked it because i'm smart or something,it's just that some people want comedies too be simple.To be something like the way to relax their mind for an hour or two.Now,i've noticed that some black communities were protesting about Robert Downey playing a black man.That is a white man playing a black man.Well i think that those communities are overreacting and that those communities are insulting their selves.What Ben Stiller tried to do by writing such a role where the white man is playing a black man is to make fun of Hollywood.To show how stupid Hollywood really is.I mean come on...Would you really be surprised if one day in some drama movie,a white man would actually be playing a black man.I sure wouldn't.That's Hollywood.A kind of a sick world in which nothing can really surprise you.I also noticed that some war veteran's were protesting about how this movie is making fun of them.Well i must say 'wrong' again.It's not making fun of patriot's or anything like that,it's just making fun of all the people who make money by making a war movies and saying that they don't make them for the money but because they are patriot's.Like a tribute to the country.Well that's bullsh_t!Most of those guy's who make those movies haven't seen war.Not a piece of it.Most of them weren't even alive at the time.I mean,OK,maybe Oliver Stone.But don't think he's making those movies because of the patriotism either.I'm not trying to judge some people with this comment or anything like that.Frankly,i don't give a damn since i'm not American but what i'm trying to say is that there are alway's some communities complaining about some movies in America.To those communities,no matter which,gay,black or veteran or any other communities,i just want to say that they should finally understand the fact that those are only movies.No point in complaining about 'em when they're gonna be made anyway!Just one more thing.I've noticed that some people were complaining that this movie is insulting mentally challenged people.Well,once more 'totally wrong'!This movie is just showing how in Hollywood every second actor built's his career and win's Oscar's for those role's.I mean let's face it.Almost every actor who portrayed mentally challenged person won an Oscar or at least was nominated.Toma Hank's,Dustin Hoffman, and so on...Even Daniel Day Lewis won an Oscar for portraying Christie Brown,who wasn't mentally challenged but sick.However he looked like he was mentally challenged.That brought him an Oscar.And he deserved it,definitely,just as both of those actor's i just wrote.But that's not the thing.The thing is that they haven't portrayed those roles out of charity but because of their own benefit.-----And that's just what this movie tries to show us,how really sanctimonious Hollywood is!-----Anyway,to end with my comment.Tropic Thunder is a smart and brilliant movie that shouldn't be taken to easily.It's a movie that's very funny but still not just another comedy! I definitely recommend it!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"American sense of humor probably which is supposed to be funny, but Cruise may receive an Oscar for his role","Unbelievable how Americans love this highly overrated movie. I saw it yesterday in a full Dutch Cinema and most of the time, the audience were quiet and people walked away,before the end. This is probably a difference in culture between two continents, although critics about the movie haven't been that bad in the European newspapers, lets's say average. You don't have to explain what kind of movie this is, believe me i understood the message. It's more that the kind of humor is not that funny at all, Jack Black is even irritating and there is only one reason to see this movie. The unbelievable funny role and performance of Tomn Cruise, especially at the end of the movie. I am not really a Cruise fan, the last movie i enjoyed with him, was his stunning performance in Magnolia and once again a not typical Tomn Cruise role seems to brings the best out of him. So i will buy this movie when it is released on DVD, just to go forward to the Cruise stuff, but the rest no, a waste of talent",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Funniest Movie of 2008?,"I always find movies and actors that are willing to lampoon themselves and their own business to be a breath of fresh air, and ""Tropic Thunder"" is nothing but Hollywood lampooning itself.If you've found this comment, you likely already know what this movie is about, so there's no need for a summary from me. I'll just say that I thought it was very funny, and proof that Hollywood is capable of making a comedy that can be enjoyed by adults. The principal male cast gels wonderfully, even if Robert Downey Jr. completely steals the show as a dude dressed up as a dude playing another dude, with even the big name actors in cameos (I'm talking to you, Tom Cruise) doing their material justice.If Hollywood is going to insist on making disposable formula films, at least it's a comfort to know that IT knows that it's making disposable formula films. Nothing would be more depressing than to think that Hollywood is giving us movies like the one being made fun of in ""Tropic Thunder"" in all seriousness.Grade: A",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A modern classic was born,"So much could be said for the complex and bountiful humor found in tropic thunder, and yet some only focus on what may be considered offensive. For those who walked into the theater to see this movie,assuming you saw the trailer, and came away shocked at the content in the film I can only come to the conclusion that you, like Tugg Speedman, are indeed a retard. Robert gave a superb performance and I believe his career is thriving right now. There were other great performances but overall I was shocked at how well Ben Stiller, who I never really gave great mind to, could write such an intelligent comedy. This is one for the ages that would even do the likes of Mel Brooks ""blazing saddles"" homage. For just about the entirety of this film I found myself laughing as I have not laughed in years. I seldom write reviews but was compelled by this film. It really is good and if you have the right since of humor, and are not easily offended, I think you might just have a great time watching this. The greatest parody of a making of a war movie ever.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Stiller Gets Lost,"Ben Stiller receives a ton of goodwill from me. Asides from looking like a thoroughly likable person, he's been in a couple of films which I have loved. Worringly he has also been in more films that I haven't. In fact, it is hard to remember the last time a Stiller film made me laugh. As I walked in to the cinema to see Tropic Thunder my fingers were crossed.It started off brilliantly. The first five minutes were guffaw inducing, popcorn spilling nuggets of comedy gold. It was like bumping into an old friend and picking up where we had left off. Then reality set in and for the rest of the film it felt like watching the old friend disappear into something he was not.The story felt as though it had been butchered from a once promising idea. At no point during the film did it deserve my suspension of disbelief. If, as a film maker, you are going to ask me to suspend it at least fill in the gap. As this was a comedy, give me laughs. There weren't any I can remember. I know the Cruise moment was meant to be funny, but to me it wasn't even close to raising a smile. The crudity and attempts at offensiveness were sad to watch. Surely Stiller has more talent than that?This is a film about becoming detached. Detached is exactly what Stiller has become. It's as though he has lost sight of what makes something funny. Hopefully he'll be found sooner rather than later!Maybe I just missed the irony and subtle subtext? That's what I'm clinging to because I still want Stiller to succeed. My hope is that he resets his dials and gets it right next time because any more dross like this and he'll end up relegated to that strata of the last resort DVD rental when all the good films are out.",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy
So whip smart it is dumb.,"A movie so whip smart it is dumb. So good at mocking these excessive Michael Bay, Tony Scott type action flicks that it is one unto itself down to the cinematography, the editing of picture and sound with those ""emotional"" choirs and slow mo death falls, to blowing the flip out of everything.Tropic Thunder is one of the better comedies I've seen in a long while and I don't like Ben Stiller much, and here he is writing, directing and starring. And doing a bang up job in two out of those three departments. Performance wise he feels a little off, doesn't fit in with the rest of the gang as well, in terms of ""are the actors fitting these kinds of roles, these stereotypes? Are they believable?"". Stiller isn't a Stallone action guy, nor a Tom Cruise. In fact I would have preferred Cruise in Stiller's role, though he is very good (I mean evil) in the role he does play.Still... Stiller is decent and funny as action door knob Tugg Speedman. If it weren't for the way Stiller plays him, which is goofier than everyone else, the film probably would be very misunderstood, and not play as much of as a broad comedy as it can be. But the operative words are ""can be"" because Tropic Thunder is a focused film in many ways, despite it being loud and all over the place (For that is one of the satirical points it is making). The characters arcs of shedding tired stereotypes for quite possibly just as stereotypical ones is great.People are talking about Downey Jr. a lot, as he's playing a white dude who is playing a black dude in the movie within the movie. And he is amazing, playing up tired images of black people, pointing at the utter ridiculousness of it all and channeling some Russel Crowe and Daniel Day Lewis to boot. But this is rally an ensemble piece. Everyone plays their part, has their say, and never are they better when all together as a team (hey it's like a lesson they have to learn in the movie!)Jack Black, Jay Baruchel and Brandon T. Jackson in fact fit their roles perfectly, so effortlessly. Baruchel, basically playing himself (if you know his previous roles) ironically stands out as the young unknown geek actor who is kind of supposed to be in the background. And finally a role has been written for Black that really does something for him. Yes he is the annoying, loud, fat drug addict, not too far fetched for someone like Black, but it works playing to his strengths. Jackson, while not as a standout for his humor, is almost the moral compass of the group, and here is the rapper turned actor who markets an energy drink called Booty Tang. And you gotta love Matthew McConaughy as the agent for ""Tuggernuts"".While the film is incredibly successful at mocking everything within Hollywood and thus our culture at large, (and offending many I am sure) there are no real clear standout moments for me. Odd I know, but again the film is so good at being what it is spoofing that it is kind of not funny at times, looking so sleek and being so loud and even ""Oscar bait-y"", and in a way that is kind of awesome.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Oscar Worthy,"This film is arguably one of the best comedies of the 2000's. Ben Stiller after having a lull in his career came back strong with Tropic Thunder. He directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Justin Theroux and Etan Cohen. The cast for the movie was spot on. It brought back Jack Black back to the spot light and allowed juggernauts Robert Downey Jr and Tom Cruise to give iconic performances.The plot of Tropic Thunder is that it's a movie about a movie. A group of actors set out to make a big budget Viet Nam film. However, they end up being put in the thick of a drug zone that forces the group to assume the roles they are playing.Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller) is an actor who use to be hot and now finds himself trying to save his career as leader of the team. Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr) is an Australian with multiple Academy Awards who undergoes pigment surgery to play his role. With the addition of Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson), Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black), and Kevin Sandusky (Jay Baruchel) as the rest of the team they set out to make movie history.This film was nominated for one Oscar. It went to Robert Downey Jr. While this was the only Oscar it was nominated for it could have been nominated for Best Original Screenplay. Since the Academy doesn't often nominate comedies it didn't happen.That aside the film is a work of genius. I have watched this movie year after year and still find it funny as I did that day in the theaters. Tropic Thunder gives you a chance to laugh at the Hollywood depiction of making a movie and gives you the chance to appreciate the talent that went into some of the performances. All together this film is just a great chance to let yourself laugh and have a good time.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Is it done yet?,When my boyfriend dragged me to see tropic thunder I thought great here is another movie I am going to be totally disgusted with. I was wrong. It really wasn't disgusting it had its few references to being gay which really didn't need to be in there. Overall though it was more boring then anything else. It didn't really have that great of a story line. The violence was overplayed and didn't really look real just kinda stupid. The drama was very corny but not really funny. The suspense just wasn't there at all. It had a good message in the end which was don't let money get in the way of friendship. But they could have made it a lot more interesting to get to that point. It had potential to either be a action type movie or a stupid comedy it fell somewhere in between not really funny but it didn't really get you on the edge of your seat either. I found myself falling asleep through it. I wouldn't spend 8 or more dollars to go see it in the theater its not really worth it. To rent it wouldn't be bad at least then when you do fall asleep you can try watching it again once you are a little more awake and you won't feel bad about wasting so much money. I am not a big Ben Stiller fan but his role in the movie was not very good and this movie shouldn't be watched just because you like Ben Stiller I think you would be highly disappointed.,3.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"There's the dude you play, there's the dude you are, there's what the dude you play says about the dude you are...","Now this is a film I knew all about or so I thought... I knew about Robert Downey Jr's. Blackface (which highly speaks of the latitudes of humor that were still prevalent as far back as 2008!), I knew about the whole 'full retard' speech (let's hope that word's inclusion won't slow down the publication of that review) and more unbelievable than a black Downey Jr., an ugly Tom Cruise.Both Cruise and Downey Jr. Got Golden Globe nominated but only the latter would get the Oscar nomination the year Ledger's Oscar was undeniable. Never compete against a poshtumous role or against an actor that is 8-nomination overdue, might be as precious a piece of advice from Downey Jr. As the whole 'retard' speech from his Australian alter-ego Kirk Lazarus. Still, while it would have made for a sensational case of reality imitating fiction (an Oscar-bait role awarded an Oscar) Downey winning would have tarnished the film's legacy and the Academy that had yet to go through the OscarsSoWhite turbulences.Now, no need to waste a whole paragraph to say that the blackface is part of the the point to be made about a certain exaggerated level of dedication to acting, one that earned Lazarus five Oscars. It's precisely because an actor like Daniel Day-Lewis spent months in the wilderness to play 'Hawkeye' or that De Niro drove an actual taxi before playing a certain Travis Bickle that the blackface joke works.And Ben Stiller's ""Tropic Thunder"" (yes, he's the director) hides behind its parodic façade a very smart examination of the limits of method acting and what it says about actors' psyche. In fact, the 'full retard' speech refers to that state of desperation for the sake of an award or at the very least a recognition from the peers, or the more serious branches. The embodiment of that trope is action hero Tugg Speedman (Stiller) playing in the failed wannabe ""Forrest Gump"", ""Simple Jack"". Alas he went on 'full retard' and take it from someone who did see ""I am Sam"", this is indeed the one-dimensional way to approach a mentally challenged character.Now I have always figured ""Tropic Thunder"" was a parody of action pictures but it goes deeper than that, it's about actors trying to push the envelope to the point of self-parodying. When the film was over, I realized the most important quote wasn't the 'full retard' speech but ""I'm the dude, playing the dude disguised as another dude"". In fact, you can transpose the quote by saying this ia film about a film disguised as another film, it's a ""real"" action picture about actors thinking they are in a ""false"" action picture that is in fact real. Ultimately, they are themselves, they are their roles, and they are what their roles reveal about them. Three levels of mise en abime so smartly imbricated that I was surprised the film didn't garner any nominations for Best Writing for Stiller, Justin Theroux and Ethan Cohen (not Coen).The main characters are introduced by false trailers and it's a remarkable exposition device that sets the tone about the film being a blow against Hollywood money-making machine with a spirit functioning like a South Park episode. Starring Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson), the sexist rap clip with booties being frenetically shaken, Tugg Speedman (Stiller) is the hero of the never-ending franchise swearing every time that that time, it will be different, the one-note raunchy family comedy à la Nutty Professor making you thank God Odorama doesn't exist, Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black) and, the intellectual transgressive Oscar-bait tackling two of the Holy Trinity of forbidden traits: sex and religion. These guys are all ridicule but never as much as when they try to detach themselves from their 'image'.Speedman believes he'll never be taken seriously unless he plays a truly dramatic role. Lazarus is the Meryl Streep of actors, embodying so many characters he feels at home in the otherness. Speedman hates the way Lazarus keeps outshining him, but as his agent (Matthew McConaughey) told him: ""if he cries, just cry more"". Both Lazarus and Speedman highlight some interesting paradoxes about actors: the less recognizable they are, the more recognition they get.Actor is the only works where you shine by the way you disappear, it's one that digs a certain talent to be anyone but you. It's no wonder one of the best lines comes from Jay Baruchel's character:""the level of insecurity"" here. Similar cases of insecurity can be spotted in Alpa Chino who's so busy blaming Lazarus for his cultural appropriation he doesn't realize it makes him wish to be no less than a token black, and there's also an interesting reveal about the Vietnam vet played by Nick Nolte. Now, don't get me started on the insecurity level of Jeff Portnoy. In fact, nothing is to be taken seriously, and even the one real death of the film is played for laughs, and the best laughs.I know the film references ""Platoon"" with the iconic arm-raising scene but I found a sort of an indirect jab at ""Saving Private Ryan"", a film that made it a point of honor to have every single character death as gruesomely as possible and I was amused by the scenes where a character was trying to articulate some well-chosen dying words with his intestines springing out of his ravaged body.Now, ""Tropic Thunder"" is close to parody but I wouldn't label it so, because it exaggerates effects but never at the expenses of plausibility, the stuff can happen and because it does it funny.. and it is funny, and Tom Cruise dancing in a fat suit is so funny... I was surprised he didn't get the nomination as well, maybe he went full 'funny'?",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Stiller shines again as director,"Ben Stiller has been around movies nearly all his life with his own career and the at one time large career of his father. Naturally he has a taste of how discombobulated things can get especially with some of the most provocative of actors are working in the same movie.What does that have to do with this movie? Well, everything really because as an average audience member I only see the actors on screen so I never really know too much about their antics and the chemistry that is involved with a group of people making a movie. This is the fourth movie Stiller has directed and each on has not as much gotten more funny, rather then better quality script, acting, and over all narrative.What makes this movie special is that Stiller combines realism in the sense of conversations before and after ""cut"" is yelled while at the same time pleasing the average viewer who wants to see explosions and action. It's as if Still completely understands in only his fourth directing job how to capture an audience of almost any kind.If you go into this movie hoping for a lot of laughs you will get that and leave satisfied, while at the same time if you wish for a good script, and great casting/performances then those wishes will be granted too. It is rare that a ""spoof"" (although you can hardly call Tropic Thunder that because it approaches different genres) contains a compelling story line and characters that you genuinely take an interest in. Why? Because that's not what is expected of a spoof/comedy and the actors know that going in. Stiller once again exceeds expectations and has the help of Downey Jr. (who is hilarious and magnificent as a psychological mess of an actor) and Cruise who comes out of no where to play the part of a snobby rich entrepreneur perfectly. This movie almost starts a new genre of a dramatic spoof although it might sound odd it makes sense when seeing the film as there are countless laughs and also excellent plot twists/narratives.The main idea though, is to enjoy a movie and I can almost guarantee that most viewers will enjoy this movie because it relates to almost every kind of audience. This movie seems to be the likely successor to The Dark Knight for the weekend box office because many people will want to see it twice and really understand all of the concepts in this magnificent film.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Quite Possibly the Best Comedy of All Time,"*SPOILERS* ""Tropic Thunder"" just, does something for me. Between its fake commercials and actual war storyline, it is a non-stop laugh fest. Ever wanted to see Tobey Maguire and Robert Downey Jr. play gay priests? I honestly never thought I'd never see myself write that.The storyline consists of exactly this: a director decides to make a war film, he doesn't like the way it's turning out so he accepts the advice to put the actors in the real situation. Soon enough, Ben Stiller is licking the blood from the director's decapitated head, unknowing that it is not corn syrup which he claims it is, Jack Black is obsessed with cocaine and Robert Downey Jr. is disguised as a black man for the entire movie.There's honestly not much else to be mentioned.

My #1 Favorite Film of All Time!,"Watched movie a dozen times. 1st time, on a date's couch. Needless to say, I wasn't impressed and did not make it through the movie. The lasting impression of the movie was blah. A year later, I was gifted the DVD; I humbly find it pure genius. With the exception of T.C. and Nolte, the performances are each actor's best and among T.C.'s and Nolte's best. Making fun of Hollywood via war film satire (think Platoon meets Monty Python) should, at minimum, interest the socially conscious. The delivery should tickle the funny bone of any person with a pulse. Along with most viewers, I was astonished at what R.D.J. did. I think Downey Jr.'s role stole the show. He played an Aussie actor playing an African-American role. Later, we get treated with a 3rd layer, albeit briefly. R.D.J.'S PERFORMANCE WAS ABOVE THOSE OF MOST GUYS WHO HAVE AN Oscar ON DISPLAY FOR BEST-ACTOR. Period. I think the film is so wonderful in part thanks to the character depth and development being superior to that of those in any comedy. For that, T.T. is my favorite flick regardless of genre, and why the movie seems like a new film almost every time I press play. Note: the commentary is worth watching.

There is a depiction of agents and the business - they skewer that hard and make it a lot of fun.This film is about several actors filming for a failing Hollywood war production in the middle of a real war zone.Sure - many jokes fall flat.

"""We don't negotiate with terrorists.""","In all honesty, my rating for this film is probably too high. But who cares. This film was very entertaining. Not necessarily funny. Entertaining. That's the thing. I didn't laugh all that much. That's why I feel like my rating is too high. But on the other hand, this film had a lot of entertainment going for it. I suppose it's more about if I enjoyed the ride rather than laughing at every single moment, so I went with giving this film too high of a rating.That said, I do think this film is a bit overrated, for sure. Many seem to consider this film the magnum opus of comedy films, and, to me, that's ridiculous. It's not that good. What's more, many seem to consider it the funniest alongside that, hand-in-hand. I feel like that's a significant exaggeration. It's super entertaining, yes, with a potential dip, in that regard, after watching it for the first time. Anything more than that, especially to a far-and-wide extent, is too much.From a general perspective, the biggest takeaway was Robert Downey Jr. I remember, a year or two ago, certain stans on Twitter seemed to have discovered this film for the first time and were wanting to cancel him. That makes sense but was still ridiculous. His performance, as in acting, was pretty decent.From my perspective, the biggest takeaway was Tom Cruise. Who, by the way, was not in the film enough. It seems like some people kept wanting Kirk Lazarus back on the screen. I felt that way about Les Grossman. Kirk was an entertaining character and all; his scenes were good. But I was always thinking, ""Bring Les Grossman back!""The rest of the cast gave good performances as well. Jack Black's performance stood out the most; he, Tom Cruise, and Robert Downey Jr. Were the faces of this film. The other cast members' performances didn't stand out as much. But there were other characters that stood out. Rob Slolom, Cody, and Rick Peck take the gold. Pretty memorable. And Damien Cockburn, to a lesser extent.The soundtrack, also, was pretty impeccable. I almost want to apologize for bringing it up because I feel like I'm already talking too much about soundtracks, even though I've only done so with two films in a row: the previous film I watched (You Don't Mess with the Zohan) and this one. But, hey. If a soundtrack is good, that's worth mentioning. This film's soundtrack was objectively better and more immersive. I love a good soundtrack with good songs that peak my ears.Another good aspect of this film was the production design/cinematography. There were a few particular shots that stood out. The cinematography, in general, was pretty good.Overall: entertaining film. The first half was the best. After that, I feel like the film dipped pretty significantly. At least compared to the first half. But I was still entertained throughout. This film was pretty average, though. I know, I know. ""WHAT!?"" I said what I said. Still, it was entertaining enough, to which I bestow upon it a higher rating than I feel, deep inside.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"If you are in the mood for a fun action comedy, then Tropic Thunder will deliver for you.","Tropic Thunder at times appears to go over the top, but it never gets boring or stupid.

Comedy Of The Year,"Tropic Thunder is a film-within-a-film, a spoof-within-a-satire. I am afraid that I cannot comment on the 'political correctness' of the film as I was too busy almost wetting myself with laughter throughout.On the note of the supposed offensive nature of the movie, I feel as though people who were offended by the movie probably didn't watch the entirety of its running time (just as with the Catholic Church and Monty Python's Life of Brian back in the 70s). Two of the reasons that these so-called 'moral crusaders' say Tropic Thunder is offensive is due to Robert Downey Jr. playing a black soldier and Ben Stiller playing a severely mentally handicapped person in his woeful attempt at drama, 'Simple Jack'.Firstly, these two roles are not devised to make fun of black people or handicapped people, they are used to poke fun at over-the-top method actors (in the case of Downey Jr's character, Kirk Lazarus) and at lame attempts at playing roles for Oscars (in Ben Stiller's case, he is poking fun at people such as Sean Penn for making movies like 'I Am Sam'). And, even despite this wealth of satire that runs throughout the film, I have to stress that, after all is said and done, Tropic Thunder is simply a very funny movie.Reason for this is the number of small parts and cameos that the actors involved make the most of. That is not taking anything away from Ben Stiller and Jack Black, who both produce very funny turns as the action guy searching for something more and the comic with a dark secret, but the smaller parts, such as Matthew McConaughey and Nick Noltes', are very funny turns (yes, that's right, Matthew McConaughey made me laugh! Wonders never cease).And, finally, special mention has to go to Robert Downey Jr. and Tom Cruise. Cruise's role as Les Grossman, the company executive with a mean streak, foul mouth and penchant for all things gangsta, is an absolute joy to watch. It was a very shrewd move on Cruise's part to take the role, and his part in the end credits is probably the funniest end credits I've seen on a film since Toy Story's fake outtakes.But as with every single review of this film that I've read, Robert Downey Jr. absolutely steals the film as Australian 5-time Oscar winner Kirk Lazarus (Russell Crowe, come on down) and Sergeant Osiris. His is one of the finest comic performances I think I've ever seen, right up there with Peter Sellers' multiple roles in Dr. Strangelove and the guys from Spinal Tap. The Academy Award doesn't give out Oscars for comedy, because they have some misguided notion that somehow drama has more right to a place in the canon of art than comedy, but if they did, Downey Jr. should get one. The man is a revelation and one of the most chameleon-like actors working today, due to his uncanny ability to try his hand at so many different genres of film and types of role.A top-class comedy that I urge anyone and everyone to see.

There are many great things about Tropic thunder First;the cast. you generally wont see this many stars in a comedy; Cruise, McConaughey, Stiller, Black, Downey Jr., and every single one of them does an impressive job. Plus, you can tell everyone enjoyed working together. Second;the action scenes. there flippin' great. normally a comedy would not have as many good or realistic scenes. so as an action comedy it really thrives. Third; stiller just made a good movie. the writing is quite good and is crammed with jokes that are quite witty (or in some cases the opposite) The bottom line is that this is quite an entertaining and funny movie that everyone is sure to enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Instant Comedy Classic!,"This was one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen. Brilliant script and equally brilliant acting all around.The performances from the entire cast were remarkable. Robert Downey Jr. was excellent, Ben Stiller was equally hilarious, with many others, all great. Yet incredibly enough, Tom Cruise stole the show as the maniacally vicious Hollywood film producer. He was only in the movie for 15 minutes, at most, but he was great. I've never scene him play such an over the top comic role & this was an eye opener.There had been some criticism of the movie based on supposed insensitivity to mentally handicapped people, but that criticism misses the point that the offending scenes were largely a parody of how Hollywood depicts mentally handicapped people in the movies, vis-a-vis ""Forrest Gump"". Along those same lines, there was plenty for everyone to be offended by, including Vietnam Vets, Blacks, Asians, Gays, Catholics, among others. It was all in good fun and most people who appreciate a really good comedy will ""get it"" and enjoy the film.If you liked ""There's Something About Mary"" or ""Superbad"", you'll love this. If you are easily offended, you might want to skip this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Side Spliting Fun,"Pampered action superstar Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller) is cast in the biggest, most expensive war movie ever produced. He sets out to Southeast Asia with a ""Who's Who"" of celebrity co-stars. They include Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.), an intense, three-time Oscar®-winning actor; Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black), star of the popular gross-out comedy franchise ""The Fatties""; multi-platinum hip-hop-star-turned-entrepreneur-turned-actor Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson); and first-timer Kevin Sandusky (Jay Baruchel).Soon after the production begins the actors are thrown into a real-life situation and are forced to become the fighting unit they're portraying, in order to find a way out of the jungle in one piece.

Tropic Thunder is the best comedy of the year.,"Stiller, Black, Downey Jr. you put those three guys together and what do you expect other than a ridiculously hilarious masterpiece. And not to mention Tom Cruise's cameo as Les Grossman.Tropic Thunder is a success for Ben Stiller and for all involved in the making. It's a great political satire and defines parody real well. The film is either making you laugh or providing you with mind-blowing action. It's a great satirical comedy that'll keep you laughing hysterically.The movie of course is not all about the profanity and utter gore, it is more about the acting. Robert Downey Jr., after the success of Iron Man, makes a comeback with Tropic Thunder and boy was he great. Almost throughout the whole movie he is disguised as a black man not only by the way he looks but also the way he talked and acted. He did it in a somewhat of an exploitational manner which by the way was hilarious and even gets questioned by one of his fellow actors why he's still in character knowing that they are not making a movie anymore, for which he responds ""I don't drop a character till I done the DVD commentary"". Seeing this movie should make every movie goer realize that Robert Downey Jr. is a very talented man who handles both comedy and actions and about anything else that gets thrown onto him.As far as the rest of the cast is concerned, all of them were thoroughly enjoyable, starting from the desperate actor Tugg Speedman(Stiller) to the drug addicted fatty Jeff Portnoy(Blcak), and the somewhat witty and young rapper Chino(Jackson). They were all irresistible. Not to forget the surprise cameo by Tom Cruise no one saw coming. His character is really irreverent and mainly laugh out loud funny, (especially the way he answered the ransom call). His character Les Grossman is very foul-mouthed and has short temper and is very hilarious.The concept of the film is very simple yet smart. The goal is to poke fun at war movies which the film did very well and provide the audience with smart and dumb jokes at the same time. And one thing Very impressive about this film is that it wasn't self-indulgent. It knew whether or not the jokes hit their target, and if they didn't they weren't prolonged. They were quick and most of them hit their mark like a bullet.Stiller is becoming more than an actor these days. He is displaying his intelligence by writing directing and acting all at once. We will look forward to his next project which I think is going be Night at the Museum 2. TROPIC THUNDER RULES. THE BEST ACTION/COMEDY OF THE YEAR.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Ben Stiller blossoms: A great take-off on war movies and Hollywood in general full of tongue in cheek humor,"Although Tropic Thunder is a take-off on adventure films, and maybe of reality TV, perhaps some commenters didn't realize it is a comedy. I don't think it is among the greatest comedies of all time, but it is at least at the top of the next tier.This is not a comedy to take your children to. It is a true adult comedy. Despite being chock full of violence and special effects, it is not a slap-stick comedy. There is a scene of farting, but it is not the farts that are intended to titillate; instead it pokes fun at the concept of people finding farts funny. Most of the humor comes from Ben Stiller (who wrote, directed, starred and produced Tropic Thunder) exaggerating the violence, blood and gore of war films. (If someone should watch Tropic Thunder thinking it an adventure movie, they won't be disappointed by the pyrotechnics.) He also pokes fun at the movie industry's political correctness regarding racial stereotyping, retardation, and homosexuality.I thought the opening ""previews of coming attractions"" were very clever and had me fooled at first. I watched ""Tropical Thunder"" on HBO and was at first uncertain whether the previews were part of Tropic Thunder or real HBO ads.I never was a fan of the string of highly successful but somewhat juvenile comedies (""Meet the Parents"", ""Meet the Fockers,"" ""Night in the Museum,"" ""There's Something About Mary"") that Ben Stiller has been cast in. But I got the idea that he probably had a lot more than that to offer when I saw him in ""Keeping the Faith"" (although this came out before all but one of the others I've mentioned, I didn't see it until later.) Kirk Lazarus tells Tugg Speedman (Stiller) that Hollywood gives Oscars to films about retarded people who are not totally retarded (""Rain Man,"" ""Forrest Gump"") but shuns films about pure retardation (""I Am Sam"").I recommend not reading too much about ""Tropic Thunder"" before you see it, or you will miss one of the treats at the end when the cast is disclosed. Without advance information you'll never believe who played some of the roles. As a director, Stiller must have inspired his cast because he got nothing but great performances from them all, although only one received an Oscar nomination.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Ben Stiller's funniest movie yet,"I have never been much of a Ben Stiller fan. I have always thought that when he succeeds, it was more due to the people surrounding him than any actual talent. This has been true from his earliest days on MTV (Janeane Garafolo, Andy Dick) through his late-'90's commercial peak (Cameron Diaz, Robert De Niro) up to today (Will Ferrell, Owen Wilson). ""Tropic Thunder"" does not change my opinion. What sets ""Tropic Thunder"" apart is that this time one of his more-talented collaborators is cinematic genius Ethan Coen, who co-wrote the script.The plot of ""Tropic Thunder"" is fairly thin, so I won't go into much detail except to say that it is about the filming of a Vietnam War drama, and fans of ""Platoon"", ""Apocolypse Now"", ""Born on the Fourth of July"", ""Hamburger Hill"" and ""Full Metal Jacket"" will see scenes from these movies all spoofed surprisingly well.I should say something about the characters. Ben Stiller plays Tugg Speedman, a cross between Tom Cruise and Sylvester Stallone, a middle-aged, washed up action star trying to go back to playing the sorts of roles that got him nominated for Oscars back in his twenties. Jack Black plays Jeff Portnoy, a cross between Eddie Murphy and Robert Downey Jr, a drug addict trying to break out of slapstick comedy roles. Downey himself plays Kirk Lazarus, a cross between De Niro and Russell Crowe, an intense Australian method actor who has undergone surgery to make himself black for the role. Brandon Jackson plays Alpa Chino, a gangster rapper with a secret, whose sole purpose in the movie is to point out that Lazarus's attempts to be black are offensive. And finally, there's Tom Cruise as Les Grossman, the amoral studio head who has all the best lines (all written--I am convinced--by Coen).As a director, Stiller falls into the usual trap: There are way too many close-ups of him making a not-that-silly face and speaking in a not-that-silly voice. I didn't find the ""Simple Jack"" stuff offensive so much as just annoying.But I will give credit where credit is due. Downey actually deserves his Oscar nomination for this one. Jack Black has never done a comedy in which he wasn't funny or gave less than 100%, and this is no exception. And Tom Cruise steals every scene he is in. Each time he was on screen, I nearly died laughing.Overall, ""Tropic Thunder"" is the funniest movie of 2009. It is Stiller's funniest work to date, even if it doesn't live up to Ethan Coen's previous comedic standards (""Raising Arizona"", ""O Brother Where Art Thou""). 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Uniqueness pays off,"Tropic Thunder is quite a shock to the system because of its originality and consequently can be quite difficult to get your head around. On occasions I was unaware of weather lines were meant to be funny or not despite the fact that they very much were. The film keeps a sense of class throughout and never divulges into the silly side of things. Stiller does an excellently job as director and actor of keeping things as realistic as possible whilst still being extremely entertaining.The actors are put into a position where the best thing for the movie is that they be competing with one and other for the best performance. Critics and fans seem to feel it was Robert Downey Jr. who came out on top and I agree he was fantastic. But my choice would have to be Jack Black. He got the most laughs out of me and had me wanting more after wards. People weren't wrong about Tom Cruise's performance either, he was superb.Tropic Thunder gets the balance between action and comedy perfect and therefore appeals to a wider audience. It's obvious everyone involved is at the top of their game and you really can't go wrong when in this position. Without a doubt one to be checked out.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
This is not worth seeing if you were paid $10 to see it.,"After the initial ratings came out on this movie, I decided that it would be a solid choice for a good night out with friends for laughs. I generally trusted the ratings on this site, so we got together a couple of weeks ago and watched in eager anticipation.Oh, how I was wrong.I won't reiterate all the points against this movie so well stated in previous reviews. It's sufficient to say that never have I felt so ripped off after viewing a movie than this. NEVER. I still cringe that I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this movie.I mean, come on, how can this get anything higher than a 4? Do we have that many Neanderthals living in the world, to be amused at such mindless, uninspired humor? I fell asleep about 3 times.I gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1 because there were a handful of genuinely funny moments, but these were far overshadowed by the absence of any passable plot.

"Gripping, funny, fast-paced.","Tropic Thunder: (n) A Ben Stiller film starring himself, Robert Downey Jr. and Jack Black. Intended to spoof all war films ever made and entertain all viewers. Contains disturbing images and thematic moments, including rough humor and sexual references. Unique in starting out in a series of bogus trailers introducing the main characters (many viewers actually went to rent the movies advertised). A very controversial film, it was blasted by some for making a mockery out of war and veterans, and praised by some who focused more sensibly on it's ridiculous side.All in all, Tropic Thunder was a very good movie. If anyone lost a relative during the Vietnam war, possibly it's best that you don't watch this, though. This movie does spoof veterans and the war in general, so you might be outraged. Otherwise, this movie is a fairly successful comedy in the style of 'Top Secret': spoof everything in sight.The acting was astoundingly good. Robert Downey Jr. in particular must be noted for his portrayal of a foul-mouthed but intelligent African-American Platoon Sergeant. (His accent is another spoofing the movie... anyone see it?) Also, Jack Black in the role of an addicted actor with a successful 'Fatty' franchise (pretty self-explanatory) was hilarious. His line 'OOOHH, I f***ing hate movies!' was improv, and so were the more witty conversations. Brandon T. Jackson was also a gem in this movie, contributing non-stop laughs in the campfire scene and the confrontation with Osiris. Ben Stiller, while not as outstanding as the others, was very convincing as a rather perfectionist and thick-skulled actor.The theme itself is quite unique (I only saw the theme of actors in a real life situation in one movie: 'the man who knew too little', which. by the way, was a great comedy), and the directors are quite adept in making the most of it. Tropic Thunder is indeed a good start to the new year (yes, I know it came out last year, I only watched it today.)PS: watch the movie with commentary later. it's like another comedy in itself: the Black-Stiller-Downey Jr.-Baruchel quartet is hilarious!

Brilliant!,"I hardly even bothered to consider this flick at the first place because I literally thought this will be yet another over-hyped comedy, knowing that almost all of the big-budget comedies (Zohan, Dollitle to name a few) of the past year have been in truth middling films. But 'Tropic Thunder' may have just earned my earnest respect as being the best comedy I have seen in a really long, long time.Whats good about Tropic Thunder is that the plot is not dumb or laughable. Its the actors and events within the plot that makes you laugh. The thought about having five real-life actors caught in a real-life war situation sounds serious, and Ben Stiller treats this both seriously and also with comedic panache. Not to mention the sight of Steve Coogan saying 'oh oh' and being blown to pieces after stepping on an old-mine freaked me out even more than horror movies in recent times, but how Ben Stiller tries to lick the blood mistaking it for a prop hilarious.The fake trailers was a masterstroke, especially Kirk Lazarus' 'Satan' Alley' fake trailer and the music which appears when Tobey Maguire touches Robert Downey Jr. That said and done, it is Robert Downey Jr. and Tom Cruise who really steal the show in this film. I have become a big fan of Robert Downey in recent years (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang being the main reason), now he will go down as one of my utmost favorites with his performance here. His performance as Osiris and absolutely weird comments such as 'I don't read the script, the script reads me' gives you a 'wtf' reaction to boot with. Don't to forget his Chinese interaction with the terrorists where he mixes a 'paddy field' and a 'poppy field'. Cruise, surprisingly, has earned my utmost credit as an actor through this film. I never doubted Cruise's ability to act, but the downside is that Cruise has not taken up enough films to show off his flexibility as an actor. Weirdly enough, a superstar like him taking up a role like Les Grossman's in a film like 'Tropic Thunder' is good news for Cruise critics. Cruise was absolutely convincing in his role, and his satirical dancing and incessant bad words spurting out of his mouth in novelty (Cruise has probably cursed more in this film more than his entire career put together). That toned-down 'Go F*** yourself' is notorious.Jack Black and Ben Stiller follow up with good performances, but not actually excellent. Stiller instills brilliant laughter at times (the panda scene), but is pedestrian in most. Jack Black meanwhile is an actor whom I personally thought would be better off doing serious roles (he was convincing in King Kong) rather than comedic roles, where he comes across a tad too self-conscious, forced humor. But in this film, Jack's style of humor comes across as a perfect suit, him being the absolute nuisance who distracts the whole unit. The 'I'll suck your dick' comment after learning of Alpa Chino's sexual identity is brilliant timing. Jay Baruchel is good and fits his role to the T but Mathhew McConaughey seems a little out of place with his role.Ben Stiller's brilliant direction and some great artwork and action direction makes Tropic Thunder the most epic comedy I have seen in my life.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"The phrase ""Ballsy"" comes to mind","For a film that's been bankrolled by Dreamworks(Spielberg,Katzenberg and Co.),this is about as sharp,incisive and unmericful a satire as you're gonna get from the film industry ABOUT the film industry.The whole product,to me,is really not as good as the parts,and the film actually seems to be a little TOO self-aware,which makes the comedy somewhat rough. But the riffing on film clichés and conventions,as well as the union of four Showbiz archetypes:the action her(Ben Stiller,also directing)who wants dearly and desperately to be taken seriously,the Award-winning Australian bad boy actor(Robert Downey Jr.,who,depending on your tolerance fro big bold character,will either be doing his most impressive or most annoying performance of his career here)whose form of ""mehtod"" acting has now crossed into racist territory;the comedic actor(Jack Black,mocking his work or his peers?You be the judge)whose unbridled success has fed his worst demons to the point of implosion;the rap star(Brandon Jackson,maybe the coolest acting here),an ambitious kid with plenty of his product to hock and an image to protect;and the low-end,up-and-coming actor(Jay Bauschel),who clearly understands the craft,script,subject material(etc.)MUCH better than his much higher paid co-stars. They go off course of the Vietnam movie they're cast in and end up being the prey of Vietnamese Meth runners.Caught in this net are a juicy(and possibly most interesting)assortment of side characters featuring: a back-slapping Charlie of an agent(MAtthew McConaughey,does he EVER act?) for Stiller's action hero,the crippled lone survivor Vietnam Vet(Nick NOlte)who wrote the book and provides script material,the jacked-up Demolitons expert(Danny McBride,almost picking up where he left off in Pineapple Express)who almost worship's Nolte's character,the harried Brit director(Steve Coogan)who probably has no business directing this project and a callous Mo-Fo of a Studio exec(Tom Cruise,receiving no billing at all and darn near stealing this show!)who regards his stars and filmmakers the way many people regard toilet paper.As alluded to before,this is hardly a perfect movie,but it does have plenty of memorable lines and a savagery of the film industry that it so richly deserves.

But as a comedy, it is hopeless. Dull dialogs, probably intended to be funny, but they aren't - they are just stupid. There were only few moments in the movie which caused me to laugh, but it's not enough to call it comedy - actually, this amount of humor is typical rather for action movies (like ""Lethal Weapon"", or even ""Boondock Saints""), but these movies don't claim to be comedies. This movie is Action - and nothing more. Bad humor, no convincing plot, no suspense.So, if you liked ""Rambo"" and ""Commando"", you will probably enjoy this movie.

This is a truly good comedy.,"With all negativity aside, I thought this was truly a good comedy, sure it was crude and offensive, but its not the first and definitely won't be the last, and I'll let in on a little secret, you get people complaining that this movie is offensive because it uses the word retard a lot for example, now take those very same people put them in a bar, give them enough booze, and then observe at how many times they use a few words over and over, my point is people sometime just look for an excuse to be full of it.The movie itself is funny as hell, and boast a lot of likable characters like Kirk Lazurus (Robert Downey Jr.), Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black), and the dweeb of a director who fancies himself Oliver Stone (Steve Coogan), Just naming a few, and for Ben Stiller a guy I figured I don't like for some reason I can't place my finger on, did a great job as director, and Tom Cruise, this is probably the first time I've seen him change his appearance, I think, because every film I saw him in that I can remember, he pretty much looked the same, this time he actually has a bold head.Overall, go see this movie, and if you don't like it for some reason then too bad, just move on and find something else.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Hilariously brilliant...,"TROPIC THUNDER is the movie that all the horrendous EPIC MOVIEs, DATE MOVIEs, SCARY MOVIEs, etc. wanted to be. It is perhaps the best and funniest spoof of Hollywood made thus far. The manner in which it is done is technically brilliant, as there are very few outright/direct spoofs; much of the humour comes from the subtext. Everything from movie trailers to awards nominations are tackled head-on, but done with taste and intelligence (something comedies of this ilk lack) and not catered to derive cheap laughs from brainless morons.Ben Stiller knows enough of Hollywood to know how the system works, and in his directorial role, he uses almost every bit of that knowledge to poke intelligent fun at Hollywood's operations.The film's cast is star-studded, as expected, and there are enough cameos to keep the avid viewer alert. Ben Stiller himself is hilarious, as is Jack Black. To me the real standout is Robert Downey Jr., who continues his career revival in one of the funniest roles seen in a long time. Another standout is the almost unrecognisable Tom Cruise (in fat suit), who steps out of his comfort zone, and shows his willingness to poke fun at himself, to deliver a memorably hilarious performance. It is worth the admission price by itself. I must admit here that I was unaware that it was Tom Cruise until the ending credits rolled. Needless to say, I felt a bit embarrassed and shocked at the same time, and immediately saw the movie for a second time. The only out-of-place actor is Nick Nolte, who seems to take his role a bit too seriously.My only complaint here was the running-length of the film. Comedies that stretch over the 95-100 minute mark usually overindulge or include material that seems superfluous. This is the case here, but it's only a small gripe, given the overall quality of the film. 8/10, 3 stars (out of 4). Should garner a place on my Honourable Mentions list.

The funniest movie of the post-DARK KNIGHT season.,"My Take: A hilarious and satirical affair. The best in acquired taste has to offer.After a couple of fake trailers have graced the screen to start the film, I knew I was in for, not just a different comedy, but a different movie-going experience. Although the mention of Ben Stiller and Jack Black are quite like warnings to stay away and the film is released much later than it should have, TROPIC THUNDER is a riot, and that's a surprise despite all the red-herrings. This not just Ben Stiller's funniest to date (In acting or directing) or the funniest comedy in a while, it's also, so far, the best movie ever to be released in the post-DARK KNIGHT season.For those who has been living under a rock for a long time (or just so recently), THE DARK KNIGHT is, undoubtedly, the biggest movie in a long time. Critics and local audiences have dug into the film (sometimes more than once) and devoured the film until after a month or two. This paved way to a series of rescheduling for many other movie releases, most of which rescheduled for next year. In the meantime, this so-called post-DARK KNIGHT season (or so I call it) is the time studios dump in most of the features they couldn't release to compete with THE DARK KNIGHT's big numbers. Regardless of a few anticipated releases (a big screen adaptation of Stephanie Meyer's TWILIGHT will be around your multiplexes by November), most of the movies released at the time are just minor efforts, meaning their not 'event' pictures. Even Hollywood needs its rest you know! So don't be so surprised not to see much long lines after opening nights and the night after. Despite a few hits, none of them are truly real 'big' movies. You can expect those sometime next year. But, in the meantime, TROPIC THUNDER will satisfy your quench for entertaining movie-going experience. It may just be the funniest movie of the summer, with one of the biggest laughs I ever had since...well, a very long time. That's because TROPIC THUNDER isn't some ordinary summer comedy. It's a clever and biting satire of the Hollywood tycoon. Although the main targets are the challenges of making war movies, it takes on apparently anything about the movie-making business. You name it: narcissistic actors, rookie directors, Hollywood's obsession with explosions and violence, event pictures, celebrity scandals, the Oscars and everything you can dig up on your Entertainment Weekly magazine and more. TROPIC THUNDER is not the first film attempting to do this job, but the good thing about it is that it doesn't do the job lazily. It doesn't just display the references, it attacks them directly. From referencing movies, quotes and celebs, TROPIC THUNDER doesn't chicken out in its assault at the Hollywood movie-making business.Ben Stiller and Jack Black are at their best playing two big-shot actors in desperate need for a career change. They do so, and so much more. Steve Coogan is hilarious as the rookie film director incapable of handling the big-named actors and the heavy demands of his production studio (including Tom Cruise's effectively hilarious performance as the raunchy film exec). But in the end, Robert Downey Jr. steals the show in yet another talked-about performance as Australian Oscar-winner Kirk Lazarus, who receives dozens of controversies when he underwent surgery to play a black character in his next movie. Playing what might be one of the most offensive character ever put on screen, Downey proves once again that he's one of the screen's finest actors today. He's capable of any character that demands him to be a complete oddball.I'm quit sure not everyone will apply to TROPIC THUNDER. I'm sure some might find that Stiller has pushed it too far. But to everyone else (and I mean everybody), this is the moment they've been waiting for. It's all clear folks, it's safe to be a Ben Stiller fan again.Rating: **** out of 5.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Stiller back on form,"Some people seem to forget this is a comedy. It has it's tongue in cheek when it talks about going full retard (hilarious speech) for a movie. It is merely mocking the Hollywood lifestyle when they argue over Tivo. This is a fun look at a crazy world with an outstanding performance from Robert Downey Jr.The start seems a bit patchy but it manages to pull it off, just. If there was one more trailer i think it would of been too much but due the quality of content in the trailers i wasn't too fussed.It's far-fetched, it's quickly paced and it doesn't run as smoothly as other comedies.

Downey Jr needs to get back into the Iron suit, he was just irritating. On the other hand I found Cruise amusing and definitely able to take the rise out of himself.To be fair though I think the idea was a good one, but it was executed badly. It wasn't satire, it was just Stiller trying to get his career up and running again, I've never been a big fan, and nothing has changed.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"A really funny, but sometimes really over-the-top film","Okay, I'll have to say this first: I am not a big fan of Hollywood comedies. Last year, Tropic Thunder caught my attention because of promising trailers and good reviews. Now that I've seen it, I can say that Tropic Thunder was and wasn't the film I expected it to be.The film focuses on a turbulent movie project called Tropic Thunder that has been hit with plenty of bad luck and bad movie making. The makers of the film want to make drastic changes to the way the movie is made. The director decides to put the main cast in the middle of a jungle and make a more realistic film in an environment that the actors will have a hard time in.There was a lot of good stuff in the movie. The easily best part was Robert Downey Jr. His performance as Kirk Lazarus, the Australian method actor and winner of multiple Oscars was fantastic. I didn't realize he had such great comic skills! It's great that Downey Jr. has been nominated for a supporting actor Oscar for the role, because he really deserves it. The rest of the cast - apart from Jack Black - was also really good. The second best thing about Tropic Thunder was the comedy itself - which is rare nowadays. It throws some great punches towards Hollywood, especially in the beginning in the form of fake trailers, which are hilarious. Technically, the film is also very good. The cinematography is the high point here, but the pyrotechnics and intestines don't come too far behind.But now, onto the cons. My main gripe with this film was that the dialogue was too reliant on genital jokes and f-words, instead of wit and pacing. Okay, maybe it was meant to be that way for reasons of parody, but frequently the dialogue went over the top. Another thing that I didn't especially love about the film was Jack Black. I admit he was great in School of Rock, but I felt he was almost useless in this one as a comedian. He didn't act in the whole movie - unless you call shouting and being stupid acting. The last thing, albeit a minor one, is that the plot itself wasn't all that memorable, but maybe it was like that for a reason...In the end, Tropic Thunder is definitely a well-made comedy. The script is really funny and it has very good acting. It is not for everyone, though, because of filthy language and sometimes quite disgusting scenes. But if you like your comedies that way, you'll most likely love this one.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A hilarious and bold satire,"When Tropic Thunder hit theaters in 2008, it brought with it a wave of audacious humor, biting satire, and an unforgettable ensemble cast. Directed by Ben Stiller, who also stars in the film, this action-comedy is a riotous send-up of Hollywood excess, war movie clichés, and the egos that dominate the entertainment industry. Nearly two decades later, Tropic Thunder remains a shining example of how to do satire right, blending sharp wit, over-the-top absurdity, and surprisingly heartfelt moments.The premise is delightfully meta: a group of self-absorbed actors, shooting a big-budget Vietnam War movie, inadvertently ends up in a real-life jungle war zone. As they bumble their way through dangerous terrain, they're forced to confront their egos, insecurities, and the harsh realities of survival. This brilliant setup allows the film to skewer both the war movie genre and the absurdities of Hollywood culture, delivering laughs at every turn.Ben Stiller pulls double duty as director and lead actor, playing Tugg Speedman, a washed-up action star desperate to reclaim his former glory. Stiller's portrayal of Speedman is spot-on, capturing the desperation and cluelessness of a star out of his depth. His journey from self-centered diva to reluctant hero is both hilarious and oddly endearing.Robert Downey Jr. Steals the show as Kirk Lazarus, a method actor so committed to his craft that he undergoes controversial skin pigmentation surgery to play a Black soldier. Downey's performance is nothing short of genius, walking the fine line between satire and parody with remarkable finesse. His exaggerated dedication to his role, combined with his interactions with the rest of the cast, provides some of the film's most memorable moments. It's a risky performance, but one that succeeds because it's rooted in a critique of Hollywood's absurdities, rather than malice.Jack Black brings his signature comedic energy to the role of Jeff Portnoy, a drug-addled comedian best known for lowbrow comedies. Black's physical comedy and over-the-top antics add a layer of chaotic humor to the ensemble, while also giving the character surprising depth as he grapples with his personal demons.The supporting cast is equally stellar. Jay Baruchel as the earnest rookie, Kevin Sandusky, and Brandon T. Jackson as rapper-turned-actor Alpa Chino round out the group with charm and comedic timing. Tom Cruise delivers a career-defining cameo as Les Grossman, the foul-mouthed, egomaniacal studio executive whose tirades are as shocking as they are hilarious. Cruise's unrecognizable transformation and fearless commitment to the role are unforgettable.What sets Tropic Thunder apart is its fearless approach to satire. The film gleefully pokes fun at Hollywood stereotypes, from diva actors and greedy producers to the obsession with awards and method acting. It doesn't shy away from controversial humor, but it balances its edginess with sharp writing and self-awareness. The jokes land because they're rooted in a genuine critique of the industry's excesses and hypocrisies, rather than mean-spiritedness.Stiller's direction is a masterclass in balancing comedy with action. The film is packed with over-the-top explosions, epic jungle battles, and hilariously absurd scenarios, all shot with the high production value of a legitimate war movie. The juxtaposition of blockbuster spectacle with outrageous comedy creates a unique viewing experience that keeps the audience engaged from start to finish.The script, co-written by Stiller, Justin Theroux, and Etan Cohen, is razor-sharp, packed with witty dialogue, clever meta-commentary, and laugh-out-loud moments. Whether it's Kirk Lazarus insisting he doesn't break character until the DVD commentary or Tugg Speedman's regret over his disastrous role in Simple Jack, the film is a treasure trove of quotable lines and unforgettable scenes.Despite its relentless humor, Tropic Thunder also has moments of surprising sincerity. The characters' personal growth and camaraderie give the film an emotional core that elevates it beyond a simple parody. By the end, the group's transformation from a dysfunctional bunch of prima donnas to a ragtag team of survivors feels both earned and satisfying.In conclusion, Tropic Thunder is a bold, unapologetically funny film that pushes boundaries while delivering sharp satire and thrilling entertainment. Its stellar cast, sharp writing, and fearless direction make it a comedy classic that continues to resonate. Whether you're a fan of action, satire, or just great comedy, Tropic Thunder is a must-watch that delivers on every level.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Stiller sophomoricies saved by his great production and Robert Downey Jrs take on Backsploitation.,"This film can't take anything seriously enough to be taken seriously. So why bother? Robert Downey, Jr's shtick and Tom Cruises' aggressive but cool dancing' producer Les Grossman. Ben Stiller & Justin Thoroux's film uses an infectious ""art mocking art mocking life"" to accompany these two blow away performances. Being that the movie is very well shot and has top notch production helps as well, but it's Downey and his staying in character routine that keeps the DVD in rotation, although Stiller sets up the laughs. ""Let's face it, the kids aren't exactly dressing up as Scorcher for Purim anymore."" With lines like that, let the film roll and don't stop until the DVD commentary is over!",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
do not go and see this film,"I felt that this film was a complete load of rubbish. So much so that in fact that I signed up to IMDb.com with the sole purpose of posting these comments. Having attended a preview of the film on Wednesday, the 17th September, it seems that I was not the only person in the cinema left disappointed, with one of the only five couples present leaving about half way through, having had enough. I managed to sit it out for the full duration of a painful 107 minutes, being left dumbstruck at the sheer awfulness of the entire film. The over emphasis of the gore was the only entertaining part of the film. Mediocre, if not poor playing of parts only added to the true shock of the film. If this was an attempt at satire, maybe Ben Stiller and co ought to sit down and have a re-think of the meaning of the word. No wonder Ben arrived at the launch night looking so pained. I think he should be ashamed of this, as should the entire crew. I want my time back!",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
It could never be done again,"The first time I saw this movie was was a teen and brain dead because I had zero understanding what was going on and didn't even remember. Watched again in my mid 20's and realised it's one of the funniest films I've ever seen. It's so ridiculously absurd yet perfection. Every actor player their role perfectly. I don't hear much talk of it, actually I hear more about Blazing Saddles (another favorite) than I do this.Unfortunately RDJ did say in an interview that he feels bad and regrets the role he played, obviously not his exact words, because it was racist. It's not at all! It's a comedy about a movie made from a book written by a war hero. His character is an actor and actors ACT!! But anyway, I still like him. He's a truly wonderful person.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
....and the real star of the film,"I watched this film for only the first time since seeing it in the cinema on TV the other day and had to say I roared with laughter at various points. It is a very clever comedy although it may be a tad too clever for some. Really great to see Nick Nolte (a much underrated actor) on the screen in an ideal part. Shame that Steve Coogan could not have been used longer or better. But for the real star of the film has to be Tom Cruise. Cruise is such a good actor, not that you'd guess that from the parts he has played recently. I really think he should have got a best supporting actor nomination for his portrayal of a cut-throat Hollywood mogul. Worth hunting out the short scene available on YouTube where he deals with ""Yellow Dawn"". If you don't hurt yourself laughing you haven't got a sense of humour. Highly recommended even if you have to rent for an evening.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Still Laughing Out Loud,"What a hilarious and irreverent satire that will have you rolling with laughter.

The humor is sharp and witty, with plenty of quotable lines and laugh-out-loud moments.While the film may not be for everyone, it's a must-see for fans of action-comedy and satire.

The story is simple enough and works throughout as does the chemistry between all the actors. It's still in my opinion some of the greatest comedic roles for these actors like Robert Downey Jr and Tom Cruise. If you have never seen this one and are a fan of crass action comedies go take a peek and prepare yourself for a wild laugh out loud ride with memorable moments that'll stick with you for the long haul. There's just so much hilarity going on with memorable lines and moments that it is truly worthy of your time.,8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A fun action comedy,"Ben Stiller isn't clueless when it comes to comedy. Stiller is a veteran in this genre and has the experience of directing going back to the late 1980's. So it is no surprise to me that this Platoon (1988) parody of sorts works out really well. The comedy is strong, the actors have an impressive script and the action is definitely there. Out of that, I found only a couple things I didn't like particularly but it shouldn't be that much of a problem to others.It seems a little confusing but the plot really isn't all that hard to follow. A small group of actors best known for playing their own various roles come together in another movie taking place during the Vietnam War to show the power of human drama. But, they never get to that point - why? Because all of them can't seem to work together. Frustrated because the director's wasting his time, effort and money and, is being harassed by a rude business mogul, he decides to take his uncooperative actors into Vietnam itself and continue filming from there. Little do any of them realize that they are headed to an area filled with real gorilla fighters. That's where things get crazy.So what kinds of characters do the actors play in this movie? Jack Black plays a drug-addicted actor who can get really delusional if he doesn't get what he wants. Ben Stiller plays a troubled actor who can't seem to get his feet in the right movies. Instead he ends up playing the Hollywood game of sequel after sequel after sequel or in just really bad movies. Last but certainly not least is Robert Downey Jr. who plays multiple roles in one shot. I consider this role (in real life) his most impressive because of how concentrated a person would have to be to perform like this. And it's not like the roles are close to each other either - he's playing Australian, who's playing an African American! That's a controversial step in acting.The action was nice too in this parody. It may not have been as frequent as the comedy but that's proportional since this is a comedy more than it is an action film. The script written by Etan Cohen and Justin Theroux did a great job. There are so many references to other films like Platoon (1988) and Forrest Gump (1994) that'll make people recollect with nostalgia. And because it is executed in the most hilarious manner, it will also generate a lot of laughs too. Not to mention that the 4th wall is broken a couple times too and Theodore Shapiro's score wasn't too shabby either.However I did find some parts of the movie a little unrealistic. For example, how can someone survive multiple stabs to the back and shoulders but still be able to move them so easily? The human body can only take so much punishment before it hurts too much to even try to move. And although Jack Black did have some rather funny moments, his character made me more annoyed with him than liked him. He just came off as always in the way. Other than that this movie is a rock solid comedy.Because Ben Stiller knows how to director a comedy, his direction on this movie propels it far higher than what people might think. Also see it for Robert Downey Jr.'s impressive acting performance.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"A story that contains irony,drama,destruction and comedy","There have been some good comedies in the years but this is probably the most intelligent and witty one that I have ever seen as it picks on certain groups such as celebrities,The Academy Awards which ironically enough got Robert Downey Jr. an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor this year,drug abuse and more.The main cast is brilliantly handled as Ben Stiller,Jack Black and Robert Downey Jr deliver their roles good especially Robert Downey Jr having battled problems of his own and making an incredible comeback.The other members of the main cast who also performed well include Jay Baruchel,Brandon T Jackson,Nick Nolte,Danny McBride,Steve Coogan,Matthew McConaughey and Tom Cruise.In short,casting is brilliant and I am surprised that the film was nominated for Golden Globes(Best Supporting Actor for Tom Cruise and Robert Downey Jr.),SAG award,BAFTA award and the Academy Award.But the praise mostly goes to Ben Stiller in terms of the amount of work he had done in this production such as writing,producing,directing and even acting in this.A great film overall.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
more like tropic blunder,"I was really disappointed with this film after all of the pre-DVD launch hype and good IMDb ratings. Apart from a very few funny moments, which I still laugh about now when I reflect on them. The start to the film is reasonable, but again has been hyped as fantastic by reviews all over. there is the odd funny reference to other Vietnam type films, but i still can't fail to see why it has all been hype'd up. In my opinion the Tropic Thunder start is smashed apart by the similar scripted element in Appocalypse Now! I believe that Tropic Thunder, again in my opinion, is a very poor film trying to make money more on the marketing and hype surrounding it. Don't let this put you off watching it, but if you want my advise rent it instead of buying it.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Tropic Thunder rumbles with laughter!,"http://entertainmentblur.wordpress.comBack to back weekends of highly anticipated comedies, Tropic Thunder rumbles pass the hype and looks like it will be the last notable film of this summer (unless somehow the teen flicks Disaster Movie and The House Bunny are well-received which will then lead to flying pigs). Ben Stiller takes charge on the screen, and behind the camera, to this extremely funny satire of Hollywood actors and the people behind the movies. He plays Tugg Speedman, an action star that resembles Sylvester Stallone. In his attempt to prove he can actually act, Tugg starred in Simple Jack and played a mentally challenged young man who talks to animals. Of course, the film flopped and has since made his career a mockery.Tugg teams up with Jeff Portnoy (Black) and Kirk Kirk Lazarus (Downey Jr.) in an epic war movie retelling the heroic tale of Four Leaf (Nick Nolte). They all have something to prove. Jeff, known for his film The Fatties that imitates Eddie Murphy in The Nutty Professor, wants to show the world he's more than just a man who makes fart jokes. Kirk Lazarus is an Australian actor who won five Oscars and is known for his commitment to method acting by falling deep into the film's character. He continues this with a controversial procedure to make his skin darker to play the role of Sgt. Lincoln Osiris who is an African American officer. Downey's character pokes fun at actors such as Daniel Day-Lewis who lose themselves in their role. His consistency in character annoys the other actors, especially African American, hip-hop turned actor Alpa Chino who finds his mannerisms insulting.The plot is similar to 80's comedy Three Amigos in the sense that they're both about actors who are thrown in a real life situation but think they're acting throughout. And once they find out, they're already neck-deep in trouble there's nothing left to do but stick it out and act like true heroes. Of course, this shtick provides a lot of humor throughout, with most of the laughs coming from Robert Downey Jr. His performance is so knee-slapping funny that he completely outshines his funnymen co-stars Ben Stiller and Jack Black. The supporting cast and cameos are the icing on the cake of Tropic Thunder. With fake trailers in the beginning that serve as much enjoyment as the Grindhouse previews, and then add Tobey Maguire, Danny McBride, Bill Hader, Jay Baruchel, Matthew McConaughey, and the scene stealing Tom Cruise as a crazed studio executive, you have the funniest movie of 2008.Tropic Thunder is daring at times as it pokes fun at the mentally challenged, terrorism, child soldiers, and color barriers. Some will find these jokes as tasteless or crude, but in the context of the film, the ignorant and spoiled actors are so numb to the world it's a portrayal of how they're simply full of themselves. It's not a cheap shot to insult the disabled, it's merely a showcase to laugh at actors.I felt Ben Stiller did a great job all-around acting, directing, writing, and producing this film. In my opinion this is Stiller's best and funniest film in his career. It's bold, funny, and explosive with non-stop laughs at a neck-breaking pace.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Delivered exactly what the trailer promised.,"Seeing Robert Downey Jr. play a black dude as an Australian was just a tad too much ridiculousness for me not to go see this. Also with Ben and Jack, two funny dudes in their own right and a fantastic action movie setting, it's kind of a must see. Well, if you're looking for laughs and violence, this is your movie.Tropic Thunder was consistently funny, and moved at a pace that left you with zero lulls. Some of the jokes, like the dancing was a little out of left field and didn't do anything for me or the audience I saw it with, but besides that, the majority of the jokes hit their mark, and every character brought something to the table. Maybe a tad more gore would have been nice, since they showed some great promise early on in the flick. But again, Tropic Thunder delivers exactly what the trailer promises; fantastic over-the-top performances (especially by Downey and Black), and lots of silly humor (even some fart jokes for good measure).",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Excellent Comedy,"This movie really shone to me as well-done and amusing. I came in with somewhat low expectations, since it came out in a month with two other big comedies (Pineapple Express and Step Brothers- both of which are also amazing and hilarious), but left satisfied.Jack Black especially stuck out to me as having done excellent in this film, very convincingly (read: amusingly) portraying a drug addict going through withdrawal. Ben Stiller was good too, but he didn't really seem to stick out as extraordinary. Robert Downey Jr. stole the show as I expected, with his character being a hilariously confused actor stuck in all the roles he had played.All in all, the action and comedy in this movie (including the un-Tom-Cruise-like character Tom Cruise plays) makes it worth the trip to the theater.

This movie is WEAK!!!,"I saw Tropic Thunder on it's opening weekend, and was very disappointed at what I saw. Until now I have been watching reviews on here and wondering if these people saw the same movie I did. I now have to voice my opinion, if you are expecting a typical Ben Stiller comedy where you actually will laugh, this movie is not for you. There isn't anything funny about this movie, other than people giving it good reviews. It looked so promising, it had a totally original idea and great comedy actors, yet none of the potential was reached. The script is horribly written and the dialogue is just as bad. The worst part about it was that there is no funny jokes or situations in it. I know this movie has been attacked for making fun of certain groups of people, but that isn't why it should be attacked. It should be attacked for wasting peoples money and time on a poorly written and definitely not funny comedy. By the way 5 out 10 is being gracious!",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Ultimate Satire of Hollywood,"At first glance, you would think this is just a screwball comedy with no substance. But in a rarity in his career, Ben Stiller has managed to create an extremely funny and satirical stab at Hollywood by combining vicious amounts of gore and lovely touches of black humour. A few down and out prima donna actors sign up for a war film to reignite their careers. But there is more to shooting this film then the actors realise.....Stiller plays a down and out action hero named Tugg Speedman who has come out of a very unsuccessful film role playing a retarded farm boy, thus tarnishing his reputation. Jack Black is hilarious as an overweight, drug addicted comedy actor who's only seen as funny when he farts in his famous film franchise (I won't give further info, you have to see for yourself).The stand out of the film is Robert Downey Jr who plays Kirk Lazarus, an Australian method actor who is so lost in his roles that he forgets who he actually is. I have never seen such a funny role in any comedy film I have seen. Supporting roles by Matthew McCoughney as Speedman's manager and Brandon T. Jackson as rapper/actor Alpa Chino also add fuel to the fire. A surprise inclusion in the film is an extended cameo by Tom Cruise, who plays an overweight Diet Coke loving studio executive. I have more respect for the man after seeing him in this film, and you will find out why if you have not seen it.'Tropic Thunder' is surprisingly one of the funniest comedies I have ever had the pleasure of seeing, blending graphic violence with humour with the right measurements to give this film such a unique status. This film should definitely not be missed. 10/10",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Tropic AWESOMENESS,"Where do I begin on this movie? From the second it opened, I just had a feeling that the $9.50 that I sort of reluctantly spent on the movie was going to FINALLY be put to good use. Right from the get go we are thrust into the comedic side of the movie (which is probably 98% of the movie) and it just never really dulls down from there. A good mix of action and comedy, Tropic Thunder finally delivers a movie which all people can enjoy. We don't have the typical comedy movie that has a lot of funny stuff and then a lot of dull moments nor do we have an action movie that has action at random times and a lot of serious stuff in between. No. We finally get a good mix. We get the action premises, with like said random action and then downtime, but the downtime is all comedy!! How could you not be entertained? Honestly, Robert Downey Jr. STOLE THE ENTIRE MOVIE for me. Every scene he was in he was absolutely hilarious and I enjoyed every second he was on screen. And Tom Cruise, despite all the crazy stuff he has done outside of acting, gave an awesomely hilarious performance as the crazy boss of the film industry. Not a typical Cruise role, but him stepping outside of those roles went to good use in this movie. Jack Black and Ben Stiller gave very solid performances as well, but Downey Jr. and Tom Cruise made the movie that much more enjoyable to watch. Seriously, one of the best movies I have seen in a long while.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Tropic Blunder,"This movie is a disaster. Renaming it to ""Tropic Blunder"" may hurt the ego of its producers but would be truer to what the audiences should expect. The film is gory and disrespectful of war veterans and people who have risked their lives in the Vietnam war or in any war. Gore and blood are enmeshed together with cynicism and insensitivity which we are to take as some deep form of artistic reflection on the evils of war and violence. Ben Stiller proves yet again that while he can be a good comedian when someone else directs him he does not live up to the job of directing. The film is filled with cursing, profanity, and sheer stupidity to the point of becoming unbearable. However, we must admit that there are several funny and witty lines in the disastrous dialog. One of those rare moments is when, Robert Downy Jr.'s character, who is a white man pretending to be black, gets into an exchange with the other African American in the group about the phrase ""you people."" Downey Jr.'s acting is still impressive, even in the midst of poor plot and writing. Besides these ""pearls"", which are few and far between, the flick is simply bad, bad, bad. And it is not funny.

Tropic Thunder is funny,"I found this movie to be very funny. More than a few times I had to laugh out loud being unable to contain myself. I know there are people who feel offended by this movie and are calling for it to be banned and yada yada yada. But the last time I checked we still had freedom of speech, so if I find this movie, which is a comedy, funny, then in a free society, I should be able to enjoy it without all this political correctness being shoved down my throat by the comedy Gestapo. Ben Stiller has made a smart, entertaining film that showcases the comic prowess of a multitude of today's Hollywood stars. Robert Downey Jr. as an Australian actor playing a black character, Jack Black, as a comedian with a heroin addiction, Brandon T Jackson as a rapper turned actor, and Tom Cruise as the film's producer, are all insanely funny while lampooning the true nature of the people that make up the movie industry today. There are references to Hollywood scandals, and actors playing handicapped roles, there is very bad language throughout and Matthew McConaughey's dilemma of letting a client die for a G-5 aircraft.

Great characters make a great comedy...,"I had no idea what to expect from this movie. Was it going to be horrible? Hysterically good? Or just lukewarm? For starters, I'll say ""Tropic Thunder"" is not a movie for everyone. It contains a substantial amount of swearing, some unpleasant gory images (used for comic effect like Monty Python), and even contains some material that people may find indirectly offensive, but I like it.The reason why I like this movie is because of the characters. Stiller, Black, and Downey Jr. lead an ensemble cast of Hollywood big shots trying to make a Vietnam War picture. Nothing seems to go right, so the director, with the advice of a Vietnam veteran (Nick Nolte) decides to take the actors out into the middle of the jungle so they can face the ""real deal"". However, things get out of hand, and what the actors thought of as a movie really isn't.As you can see, the story isn't that special, but each character is unique and funny in their own ways. Ben Stiller is the action hero, a complete spoof off of Sylvester Stallone, Arnold, and even Willem Dafoe (from Platoon). Jack Black is the comedian, a satire off of cheap comedies that Eddie Murphy would star in. And Downey Jr., is the award winner, a spoof of all the great actors ranging from Russell Crowe to Marlon Brando.In addition to these guys, there are many excellent cameos, including: Tobey Maguire, Jon Voight, Matthew McConaughey, and Tom Cruise (strangely dressed up as an obese, bald, Hollywood producer). Every actor in this movie is great and funny. They turn an okay plot into something worthwhile. In addition, there's also a lot of action and nonstop satires against other movies and Hollywood itself.The one thing I have to note, is that people have criticized these movie because of the multiple uses of the word ""retard"". It is used, but not as an insult to the mentally handicapped, but aimed at one of the characters.I enjoyed every moment of this film, from the opening trailer satires to the closing credits. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Consistently Funny,"I was surprised by how much I liked this movie. Most modern Hollywood comedies leave me cold; they barely seem to have more than one or two decent laughs each, but this one had me chuckling throughout. The story is complete tosh, but of course it isn't supposed to be taken seriously, and most of the biggest laughs are found in the interplay between the five hapless heroes anyway.Director and co-writer Ben Stiller stars as Tugg Speedman, waning star of six Scorcher movies, who finds himself abandoned in the middle of some Asian jungle with the co-stars of his latest flick, Tropic Thunder, after the movie's director (Steve Coogan) takes exception to their prima donna antics on set. Unfortunately, their location happens to be slap bang in the middle of territory controlled by a vicious gang of drug smugglers although, as Coogan has told them they will be filmed by hidden cameras as they make their way out of the jungle, it's a good while before they realise the danger they are in is genuine.The film takes humorous swipes at Hollywood, its movers and shakers and its product with a sure footing and an insider's knowledge. It also has a refreshing awareness of its own precarious position as it adroitly avoids descending into the crass juvenile humour of spoof movies. I liked the way it wasn't afraid to point a finger at the absurdity of its own profession (check out that spoof trailer for Kirk Lazarus's monks-in-love movie in which he is hailed as five time Oscar winner, and Toby Maguire is introduced as winner of MTV best kiss scene of the year award winner – and, of course, Speedman and Lazarus's infamous discussion about the pitfalls of going 'full retard' – to see what I mean), while never turning snide or cynical as it does so. Stiller and his co-writers are extracting the urine for sure, but there's no doubt they're doing it in an affectionate way.While everyone gives great comical performances, Tom Cruise, somehow getting away with playing an instantly recognisable foul-mouthed megalomaniac movie executive, steals the show in his relatively few scenes. He's got the moves, and he knows how to sell a G5. Where Cruise is over-the-top hilarious, Downey's Kirk Lazarus, barely recognisable under his altered skin pigmentation, is consistently funny in a low-key way as one of those irritating actors who insist on going deep into character. I was still chuckling over his scene with the black guy late in the film ('so are we cool now?'

There were the straight-to-video (remember video?) titles too... and, with a poster sporting a tough looking, buffed up Ben Stiller; an affro'd Robert Downey Jr (brilliant in Iron Man, and hinting at the classic cool blaxploitation action hero of the 1970s, such as Fred Williamson and Richard Roundtree?); plus the always hilarious Jack Black, in an action comedy/spoof? I couldn't wait...Sadly, it just didn't deliver. Tom Cruise's cameo wasn't funny at all (just creepy); Stiller's 'going deep' (a la Col. Kurtz) wasn't funny; the talented Steve Coogan was wasted and Jack Black didn't really do anything... the references to insecure actors and ruthless producers might have provided laughs for Stiller's colleagues, but it did little for me...Nick Nolte was great as the deceptive vet, and the explosives/sfx guy was hard case, but I ultimately found this pretty disappointing...Oh, what might have been...",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Home Run,"This movie will go down as a classic.The leading trio of Ben Stiller, Jack Black, and Robert Downey Jr. were all on their A-games. Stiller proves to be an excellent director. The dialogue was hilarious. The characters were masterfully carried out by the actors.But, Tom Cruise steals the show. His character is so hilariously over the top funny, everyone else pales by comparison. I was totally blown away by his ability to be self-deprecating and immerse himself in such a character that has absolutely no redeeming qualities. I couldn't stop laughing every time he was on the screen. He even sent me out of the theater laughing out loud. Great movie, but definitely earned its R rating. I will see it again and buy the DVD.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Great fun; Best American Parody in Recent History,"This is a very funny movie that should tickle the funny-bone of fans of any war films, and any other comedy fans. Ben Stiller proves himself as being a better director than his previous attempt with Zoolander and Tropic Thunder is one of the best comedies of 2008.We have a solid primary cast between Stiller, Black, and Downey Jr., but good old Robert Downey Jr. manages to steal most of the scenes from his co-stars as the white actor playing the black platoon sergeant (""I don't drop character until the DVD commentary"").There are plenty of star cameos, but the best (and most unexpected) comes from Tom Cruise, who plays a foul-mouthed, fat corporate executive. His cameo was originally intended to be kept a secret, but it was impossible to keep this appearance from leaking to the internet. Let me tell you, this man may want to move into comedy considering his current negative status among the public. He was SOLID in this movie. I would have never expected Tom Cruise to pull a role like this, but he did and he actually was incredibly funny in most of his scenes. The audience at my theater applauded when the credits showed his name.Other notable appearances are by Nick Nolte, as a Vietnam Veteran, and Matthew McConaughey as the Ben Stiller character's agent. Tobey Maguire also makes a humorous appearance at the beginning of the film.Overall I was tickled, and surprised by this very well-balanced cast of notable actors. Every actor in here gets off some good jokes, and in different styles of comedy. This film had lots of different types of jokes, ranging from parody, satire, drug addiction, slapstick, and just plain silly antics. This film had everyone in my audience laughing at one point or the other, through its many references.I felt this redeemed a long string of horrifically bad American made parodies. I never liked the work of Matt Stone and Parker with their shows such as 'South Park', and don't even get me started on this 'Disaster Movie' nonsense. Only notable films I could spot were made by the Brits, with such brilliance as Shaun of the Dead, and Hot Fuzz. Tropic Thunder isn't as good as those two films, mind you, but it certainly beats out all recent American made parodies. I never felt offended, or attacked by this film. It set out to entertain, and it entertained me from start to finish.Tropic Thunder is great fun!",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
More Than Just A Comedy,"Tropic Thunder is a great movie for a lot of different reasons and there it is not offensive or racist, as people have been claiming. It is certainly ridiculous and over the top but I think it has to be. There are so many laugh out loud moments in this movie but it also very well thought out and intriguing.Ben Stiller does a good job of acting and maybe even a better job of directing. I loved the entire cast. Jack Black is hilarious, and Robert Downey Jr. amazed me with his ability to do so many different voices and characters. I think this may actually be the only movie I've ever like Tom Cruise in but I was almost rolling on the floor laughing at most of his scenes. I also thought the story was top notch and very well thought out, especially for a comedy.

One of the funniest -and smartest- movies ever.,"This isn't Citizen Kane, Quiz Show or Gone with the Wind. It's not overtly cerebral nor is it going to win an Oscar.It is, however, a truly brilliant film in its own right. One which takes a critical and hilarious look at Hollywood and all its inhabitants, insecurities, superficiality and social quirks and rolls them all into an extremely well-produced and accessible film, set with a backdrop of popcorn-style action.Every character, from the 'stars' of the movie-in-a-movie to Tom Cruise as the truly amazing Les Grossman and Matthew McConaughey as the overgrown frat boy agent was performed pitch-perfect. And as others have said, Robert Downey Jr. absolutely stole the show. He was quite simply a phenomenon as a 'dude, playing a dude, disguised as another dude'. The jokes are funny and well timed, and the humor is absolutely unflinching in its disregard for political correctness.I have to say, however, that it took me a couple of viewings for all of this to really become apparent. I went into my first viewing expecting something funny and worthwhile, but was not prepared for what I got. After my second and third time I really began to appreciate how truly clever this film actually is. It helps if you have some understanding of Hollywood and the movie business in general... I could honestly see a good deal of the humor going over some heads (which probably accounts for some of the bad reviews here), as well as foreigners, who probably just don't understand this type of humor at all.Either way though, its definitely my opinion that Tropic Thunder is one of the best films of the 21st century thus far. Watch this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Excellent action comedy that is also part satire about film-making in Hollywood.,"Three spoiled Hollywood actors, one is a action star Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller), the second is a comedian Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black) and the third is a five-time Oscar-Winning over-talented actor Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey, Jr.). These three actors are making an Vietnam film, based on a true story. Which it is written by a Vietnam veteran Four Leaf Tayback (Nick Notle). But the director (Steve Coogan) has problems with these over-demanding actors that the film's producer (Tom Cruise) wants these problems solved as soon as possible. Since it's already over-budgeted, just shooting for four days! The novelist tells the director, he wants to sent these actors in the jungle with the real enemies close by. Along with the novelist, the director, prop man (Danny Mc Bride), the three lead actors and the two supporting players (Brandon T. Jackson & Jay Bunichel) to be sent in the darkest heart of the jungle of Vietnam. But they find themselves way over their heads too soon and having trouble with the notorious Vietnamese drug-lord (Brandon Soo Hoo).Directed by Ben Stiller (The Cable Guy, Reality Bites, Zoolander) made an very enjoyable satire about the way of film-making in Hollywood by making Big Budget movies seem always overblown in the process. Director Stiller also makes this fun for the audiences by adding action and some truly funny memorable moments. For me, this is the most enjoyable Stiller performance since ""There's Something about Mary"". But Stiller does have an great cast surrounding him. Downey, Jr. and Cruise have all the best comedic moments. Matthew McConaughey appears in a supporting role as Tugg's dedicated agent/friend.The original theatrical cut DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an hilarious commentary by Stiller, Black and Downey Jr. (Still in his character from the movie). DVD also has featurettes with interviews with the cast & crew. Perphas the biggest surprise is how shockingly well written it is by the actor/producer/director Stiller, actor:Justin Theroux and Etan Cohen. They certainly got the premise right on and they wrote an first-rate script. This is my third favorite film of 2008, along with ""Wanted"" and ""Hellboy 2:The Golden Army"". ""Tropic Thunder"" is the funniest comedy of the year so far, while ""Step Brothers"" comes in as the second funniest this year. Don't miss ""Tropic Thunder"", see it now on the big screen. Panavision. Also available in a two-disc Director's Cut DVD and Blu-ray.(**** 1/2 out of *****).",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Hilarious Throughout,"I saw Tropic Thunder in a nearly noon showing. The movie was genius. It was an entertaining look at how some in the movie industry view their peers and themselves. The movie isn't about making fun of the handicap. It isn't about so-called ""black-face'. It's about actors, filmmakers, producers, its about fun. All the performances were entertaining and all of the main roles were fleshed out well. Each character feels as though he could (more than likely not) be real. Robert Downey Jr. does a great job as an actor who gets a little too far into his role. I usually dislike movies with Jack Black in them. There are a few that are tolerable but most are just not for me. He portrays and makes fun of himself pretty much, a guy he could be and maybe is similar to himself (minus the addiction). Ben Stiller plays a confused action star whose career may be at close. But my favorite of all was Tom Cruise. You have to see it. Best comedy of the summer IMO.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
More than meets the eye,"It took me two viewings, separated by several years, to really appreciate this film. Reading here on IMDb of the huge critical praise it received, and the numerous awards/nominations, underlined my reaction. There's more here than can be easily taken in with one viewing.All the other IMDb reviews have dissected the story. The satire and parody are deft, on so many levels. So many movie memes are skewered, it's really a good, complex approach to the genres of war movies and black comedies.Excellent performances all round, and a superb ensemble cast, kept me from.getting distracted by minor details - technically it was very very well done.Not a fan of Tom Cruise, but this is my favorite role he's ever done, hands down.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"There is a comeback role in this movie, and he ain't in the posters either","A critic's life is fairly simple, honestly it is. You complain about something that everyone else likes, support your opinion with more opinions, be the louder individual, boast the fact that you have seen more movies, then call it a day. Repeat process for all eternity. Hollywood needs to be ridiculed right about now with all that is going on in terms of its business, politics, beliefs, and decisions, and this movie pushes all the right buttons, becoming a movie for the critics described in the first epic sentence. Nobody in Hollywood is safe as movies, celebrities, decisions, and all aspects of Hollywood are dissed, spoofed, and is the subject of all the smaller inside jokes that movie critics would understand while the general public would pass off as mere dialogue. Meshing in the smart-aleck anti-Hollywood humor is enough action, visual gags, and one-liners to entertain the wider audience. Tropic Thunder is hilarious, and the more you've seen from Hollywood, the funnier it shall be. This movie exposes nearly all the silly shenanigans of Hollywood.The story in the movie is its biggest downfall whiles the entire cast, spillage of cameos, and visual jokes more than make up for the pratfall of a tale that is delivered. While some roles were not written well, the actor portraying him saves it from being a total meltdown. Whatever directing miscues by Stiller become apparent, the cast is right there with the next witty one-liner. It is a wild ride from start to finish.A group of actors, the action star trying to regain fame (Ben Stiller), the Oscar hog (Robert Downey Jr. in an Oscar-worthy role), the prankster trying to break out of typecasting (Jack Black, underused), the rapper-turned-actor (Brandon T. Jackson) and the film buff (Jay Baruchel), are sent to a secluded part of Vietnam so they can save the filming of a true story. However, in a series of freak events, they are forced to become the soldiers they are becoming in the flick. The five of them have to team up to survive the onslaught of enemies, despite their differences in personalityand acting. Yes, the movie sounds a little bit like Three Amigos, except its grittier, nastier, more violent, and has more commentary undertones.As previously stated, the acting is definitely what runs this movie. The main five characters (among others) throws so many lines at you, you won't be able to catch every single awesome quote (""It was a long flight"" was missed by all). Robert Downey Jr. deserves at least an Oscar nod for his performance, he steals the show at almost any moment in which he speaks. Everyone else does a grand job (with Jack Black even doing decent despite having little material) but Downey Jr. and a certain cameo propel this movie from decent to surprisingly good. This is definitely the comeback movie for an actor, but its not one you'd expect.Wall-E was a tough pill to swallow as it was slow, yet mystifying. Tropic Thunder on the other hand hurls so many little pills at you; you might not be able to take them all. The pacing was fast, at times way too fast; and then sometimes the movie slows down to almost a halt. Ben Stiller has the right idea, but a better director could have definitely improved the movie. This is a better effort than The Cable Guy, but Stiller needs a little more work. The pyrotechnics enhances the warfare aspects of the movie, and some of the make-up and special effects added to the absurd over-the-top humor that Ben Stiller is known to possess.It may require a second viewing to catch all the jokes because there are layers upon layers of jokes patched throughout. Hollywood is insulted, so are war movies, so are many celebrities. Sometimes a scene is so entertaining the major joke(s) of the entire moment flies over your head (Pay close attention to the final shoot-out). Don't expect this movie to win any Oscars, as the Academy Awards are even made fun of in Tropic Thunder. There is a little bit of something for everybody, and this is definitely one of the best Stiller flicks he's even been caught up in. Stiller possesses the Sandler syndrome, in which the best movies of Sandler involve him not hogging all the attention but sharing it with the cast. Stiller has his moments, but so does everyone else.Bottom Line: One of the funniest movies in a while has arrived here. With plenty of action, humor, and randomness possessed, Tropic Thunder is a high and mighty spoof with very little slowdown and very little unfunny scenes. Robert Downey Jr. yet again proves why he is one of the more underrated actors of the past couple of decades and Stiller proves that he can step out of his quick-buck comfortable humor and dip into something darker and much more vulgar. Expect silliness, expect cameos, expect left field humor, but also expect some smart jokes flung in there to throw you off. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the humorous carnage.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Not very good. Laughed once.,"I understand that this movie was supposed to be a spoof. But honestly, it would have been better if it had the title of ""war movie"". I at least wanted to see a plot but even that was out of the question.The only funny part was at the very beginning when they show the trailers of all the actors. Robert Downey Jr. gives a good performance but Ben Stiller should think about a third ""meet the parents"" so nobody loses faith in his comedic skills. Jack Black is washed up and I hope he never does a live action movie again. Stick to animated animal movies Black.I haven't regretted seeing a movie yet this summer and I have seen all the big ones except Hellboy 2, just because I think the Pan's Labyrinth dude is not as good as people think he is.Do not see this movie!

Look at the cast...,"Well first of all as you can see in the title just look at the cast. The reason for this is because it has a brilliant cast. Top actors having small parts, and nails them. I'm not going to point out all of them but Tom Cruises character, which haven't much screen time but despise this is a brilliant character and Cruise is perfect for the role.I felt this movie is a dear movie to Ben Stiller and this is because he has put so much effort in to it. He is the director, writer, producer and so on. I can honestly admit i find his kind of movies extremely fun to watch, although some of them are very shallow. This however has a little dept to it, and intelligent humor well hidden under childish humor. This you just have to love.I looked very forward to see this movie, because of the fuzz, trailer and most of all crew and actors. And when you see a movie with high expectations its easy to be let down. This movie did everything but let you down. It is hilarious. And I have to say Robert Downey Jr. does an excellent part and I'm afraid he outshine the other actors being that this is unlike him, and the part is hard to do. This shows a totally different side of him which is fun to watch.Now to say it all very easy. Extremely fun movie with a brilliant cast. If you want to see a good comedy where you'll laugh a lot this is definitively for you. And if you like to make fun of Hollywood then you HAVE to see the movie.

Overrated,"Okay, let me get one thing straight because this bothers me so much: Robert Downey Jr's performance was not as brilliant as everybody makes it out to be. He wasn't Razzie-worthy, but he wasn't Oscar-worthy, either. Okay, now that it's off of my chest, let me unmask this movie. It is unnecessarily gory. It was humorous but disgusting at the same time, and the latter outweighed the former. The humor was derivative, and the plot was like a slice of Swiss cheese. The verbal vulgarity made my ears bleed. Sometimes there was a scene of humor that was either so disgusting or so stupid and unfunny that I just thought ""Hurry it up already"". There were a few moments that were just plain surreal, something to which a text-crazy individual might cry: ""WTF?!"" I had high hopes for Tropic Thunder (I heard it was hilarious, and, of course, Robert Downey Jr. was nominated for Best Supporting Actor), but it let me down. Definitely not a ""must-see"".

A perfectly fine comedy that does the job.,"Tropic Thunder is not your regular comedy. Nor is it your regular Ben Stiller comedy. Sure, it is crass and offensive at times but it also is massive and dripping with pyrotechnics and an all-star cast.The basic plot revolves around three Hollywood archetypes- the fading action hero ( Stiller ), the comedian whose looking for some dramatic cred ( Black ) and the critically adored method actor ( Downey Jr. ) who are all participating in one of the most over budget and bloated productions- so much so that the production company threatens to shut the director ( Steve Coogan ) down. Said director though gets an idea from the eccentric author ( Nick Nolte ) who inspired said movie and takes the cast out into the jungle to shoot the footage 'guerilla style', inadvertently tumbling across the Golden Triangle in the process.Tropic Thunder could have been a real controversial flop- the film alludes to people with learning difficulties and blackface makeup, but the film manages to tread a line between bad taste and satire that works OK for the most part. Stiller and Black offer up performances that are not particularly new, but are suited to their parts. But it is Robert Downey Jr. as Kirl Lazarus, the Australian Award Winner, who really makes the film come alive. Some of his lines are truly hilarious and he delivers them with such verve that you can't help but laugh. Couple this with great cameos from Tom Cruise as a studio head Les Grossman and Bill Hader as his sycophantic assistant and you can forgive Black and Stiller for acting a little flat.Tropic Thunder is by no means a perfect movie but it is highly entertaining and fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Sheer Genius,"It's a rare moment that a movie brings me to breaking down and letting it flow. This is not one of them. It is, however, a worthy entry of parody and parity into the veritable plethora of satirical satire-based movies that pulls together so many unworthy, yet somehow worthy, genre movies. It begs the burning question: ""Who IS Kaiser Sose?""That said, I give myself bonus points for finding Tom Cruise before the credits. When a movie has this many big names (Nick Nolte!), you know there must be something to it. There isn't, but somehow you want there to be.The true beauty of this movie is you have to be intelligent, insightful, fluent in current, recent and historical events, and a movie-goer who's seen all the movies (and actors) this movie references. It doesn't hurt to know a bit about cocaine and ""The Jeffersons"" either.The burning question: Is that Ben Stillers very fugly sister, or Ben Stiller in drag?P.S. I loved this movie.

New original comedy,"Do not expect it to be better than Zoolander. Tropic Thunder has, still, great humorous scenes, great acting and a nice script. It guarantees to raise some new laughs and keep you interested in the plot.Despite of a (in my opinion) misuse of Jack Black's skills as a comedian (I think he was put on there just to get some more attention on the film), the acting is marvelous. Robert Downey Jr. takes most of the acting credits with a great performance (actually it's like a triple or quadruple performance) although Ben Stiller keeps his popularity and main role. I expected this movie to be full of dumb typical jokes and the same old comedy-like character disposition, but it really surprised me, right from the beginning.

The next level,"This is a brilliant piece of work. A comedy/parody that actually emulates at the level of its source material. Ben Stiller has clearly done his homework and here recreates many epic battle scenes. The photography is stunning and the direction is nothing less than awesome, for the first twenty minutes or so. Although the movie loses direction a little in the second and third acts it has enough great script and sheer momentum that it never falls below excellent. This really is a stunning piece of work. Look at what else is out there. This is constantly funny but also technically brilliant and very artistic. There are no 'longeurs' and every scene moves the action forward. The performances are spectacularly good. Tom cruise still looks slightly too 'Tom Cruise' but his lines are almost perfect. As a whole his part is 1000 times better than in that defecant Magnolia. Robert Downey Jr is almost embarrassingly good. He plays Bill Cosby playing an actor in a movie, but then he slips into a stereotype of all 'our favorite' Black actors. He is challenged by the one real Black guy and this scene serves to show that he is an actor, playing an Australian actor who is trying to play a Black American. Ther are too many other outstanding features to mention, such as the child general and Jack Black's best work in years. All in all, this is not a mainstream movie. It is Something Else.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Thunderess,"I don't want to give to much away about this movie, I know that sounds weird about a comedy but in this case it's true. Some of the films most laugh out loud hilarious moments are surprises, things you wouldn't have expected just from seeing the trailer. I am so glad that is the case because so many comedies lately have been ruined by their funniest moments being in the trailer. With all that out of the way, this is a entertaining movie, a lot of that is due to the quality of Robert Downey Jr., he is without a doubt the most underrated actor in the main stream today. Sure this movie does not really give him a chance to really stretch his legs but he does bring his quality of acting to a genre that most dramatic actors dare to go. At times this film is really aimed at movie buffs, so of course I love that, all the little references or shots stole from other movies. Sometimes it takes movies like this to realize how overly dramatic certain other movie moments really are. Bottom line on this one is this, this film was not all I had hoped it would be but maybe my hopes were a little high, it's not often that I am excited to see a new comedy in theaters, so when I was maybe I expected a little to much. This film has many hilarious moments, many memorable lines, and some great surprises. Compared to most straight up comedies this is definitely a step above all the rest.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Tropic Thunder a hilarious satire of Hollywood,"Ben Stiller is a pretty funny guy, in case you weren't aware of this. Whether working on his own short-lived sketch comedy series to starring in films for the Farrelly Brothers to directing and starring in his own theatrical productions, Stiller does not disappoint. So, it is no surprise that his most recent directorial turn, Tropic Thunder, is a pretty funny movie. A satire of Hollywood and war movies, Tropic Thunder delivers the laughs in spades and proves to be one of the funniest movies of 2008.Tropic Thunder features a film in production based on a true life story by ""Four Leaf"" Tayback (Nick Nolte), the survivor of a major Vietnam war battle who lost his hands in the process. The film is being headlined by down-on-his-luck action star Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller), method actor extrordinaire Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey, Jr) and drug-addled comedy star Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black), each of which is proving intolerable to work with for director Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan).After being threatened to be shut down by a studio executive, Cockburn is given a bit of inspired advice from Tayback: take the actors into the jungle with just the director and shoot the film documentary style. There is one problem with this plan: the jungle they land in is controlled by drug growers who take some of the actors hostage, leaving the others to formulate a plan to save their comrades, while fighting their own lack of real world skills and prima donna attitudes.Tropic Thunder is a film that, for the most part, isn't afraid to skewer some major Hollywood troupes. The ridiculousness of some method actors, the sense of entitlement by major stars, the desire for directors to make a major ""statement"", the willingness of agents to go to extremes for their clients and finally, the over-the-top, do my bidding attitude of ""mega"" producers, Stiller and fellow screenwriters Justin Theroux and Etan Coen leaves few stones unturned in their search for things to satirize. Most of the jokes hit home, providing an abundance of laughs.The screenplay is helped in large measure by it's actors, especially Robert Downey, Jr, Jack Black and Tom Cruise. Downey, Jr's turn as Kirk Lazarus is absolutely hilarious, portraying a man who gets cosmetic procedures to darken his skin so that he can portray an African American member of the original military squad. Like behavior that is reported about many method actors, Lazarus refuses to break character at all, always acting as if he is an African American. The results are side- splitting at times, and Downey, Jr, experiencing a resurgence in his career, delivers a knock out performance. Black uses his usual manic energy to good effect as Portnoy, who finds himself trapped in the jungle with no drugs and quickly going through a rather tough withdrawal. But, the show is completely stolen by Tom Cruise as producer Les Grossman. Covered in makeup and a fat suit, Cruise brings the foul-mouthed, hip-hop dancing producer to life to great comic effect. While Cruise has a smaller part, when he is on the screen, you largely can't help but crack up laughing.Tropic Thunder is not for everybody: it is filled with a decent amount of violence and gore, and is laced top to bottom with vulgar language, so if you are easily offended, Tropic Thunder is not going to be for you. But if you appreciate a smart satire of modern Hollywood, you don't have to look any further than Tropic Thunder.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Pretty Damn Funny,"This movie was pretty damn good. While the humor and Robert Downey Jrs role may not be appropriate today, this movie still stands as funny in 2024. The acting from Downey was honestly incredible and the whole cast was great and fun. There were multiple moments where I laughed out loud pretty hard, and this is a movie that definitely could be watched again. I thought the cast worked perfectly together, and having guns and violence in a comedy movie usually ends up in a good time. With a sneaky and surprise visit from Tom Cruise was a nice cherry on top to a great cast. This ranks as a very solid comedy movie in my opinion.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Tropic Thunder - Best comedy in a long time,"From the fake promo's at the start of the movie, I was giggling like a school girl. I even snorted at one point.Stiller does the character he does best - stupid - with gusto. I love the theatric gun shooting. Jack Black plays the loud, never funny, Tom Candy character that he seems to have typecast himself into.Robert Downey Jnr is a true crackup and a little confusing as an Australian acting as a stereotypical black guy. Its like they put a costume on him and told him to talk like Dave Chappell impersonating Samuel L Jackson. Masterpiece stuff.This movie really satires its own industry depicting drama-queen actors, yuppie agents, and ego driven typhoon movie producers against the darker, deadlier world of arms bearing drug manufacturers in a very remote dare-we-not-say-it Asian nation.And if the script wasn't funny enough, a ton of action was thrown in too. Call me simple, but I love explosions.Refreshingly, the movie lacked a token love interest. Thanks. Though they really made up for it with a certain repeatedly flogged product placement.I didn't understand the prominence of Tom Cruise's role as the producer. I feel most of his scenes were supposed to be funny simply because he is Tom Cruise. Anyone could have acted that role. And it's not just me - I didn't hear one laugh during the end scene.Movies don't get much better than this. Even my missus loved it, and she's a sook.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Clever, original and funny, Tropic Thunder lives up to it's expectation.","Many reviews of this film have called it a mean shot at Hollywood. That has been used in both a negative and positive light, but either way, I didn't feel that was very true at all. Sure there is some references to Hollywood and actors in general, as there should be in a movie about that. The only Hollywood aspect shown as a negative is the heartless producer, played by no longer surprise guest Tom Cruise. I felt I'd get this out of the way first, but whether or not you find the biting satire of Hollywood to be plentiful, I'm sure you'll find the laughs are.A new huge budget movie, Tropic Thunder is currently being directed, by newcomer filmmaker Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan) none the less. The actors in the movie include aging action star Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller), method actor Kirk Lazerous (Robert Downey Jr.), comedic actor Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black) and rapper Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson). After a series of expensive blunders, the movie producer Les Grossman (Tom Cruise) becomes very angry. The writer of the book that the movie is based on, Four Leaf Tayback (Nick Nolte) decides how to solve the problems and suggests they shoot the movie guerrilla style, with hidden cameras in the trees. Take the boys to the action for authenticity. What we end up with is a small group of actors stuck in the jungles full of men who are ready and willing to torture and kill them.The jokes in this movie come at fairly fast rates, though not so fast as to stoop to lame crotch hit gags or typical fart jokes. The acting is usually perfect to the characters. Robert Downey Jr. plays a ""black man"" and gives an over the top, but believable performance. If I shut my eyes and just listened, I could swear Brandon T. Jackson is Wanda Sykes with a sex change. Despite that he was a nice addition to the cast. Tom Cruise was a little too much at times, but he has a screen presence, so even when he was acting like a moron, it was fairly enjoyable. Jack Black was amusing in his drug addicted state and was normally funny, as was writer/director/actor Ben Stiller.The direction worked very well. It was mostly tight cuts and fast paced, but many scenes spoofed other war movies, and they are filmed how the other movies are. Ben Stiller has these war movies down, too. From the direction, to the lighting, to the acting, he obviously has seen many of these types of movies.Overall, this is a funny, enjoyable movie. It's violence doesn't make the tone any darker, either, which is good in this case.My rating: *** out of ****. 107 mins. R for language, violence and drug content.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"""I'm a lead farmer, ...."" - Kirk Lazarus","The only reason I didn't value ""Zoolander"" so much is because I didn't think it was a difficult thing to achieve; a parody of the world of male models. Yes, it was originally presented and the script made a good use of the predictable character descriptions, but nothing else. I don't intend to make a comparison because both share a signature (Ben Stiller's) and in both this is established from the beginning: with a flash about Derek and how being a male model is like in ""Zoolander"" and a few trailers that mock the film industry with audacity in ""Tropic Thunder"".The film industry? Well, actually ""Tropic Thunder"" only messes with Hollywood, and it has no mercy. Stiller, intelligent as he is (although I don't like him as an actor very much), makes the wise choice of not taking on any political or religious issues, reducing everything down to the world he knows best; the world he lives in. After this decision, he elevates the risk by giving his comedy multiple dimensions and getting them all right.Essentially, Stiller's movie (co-written by Stiller, Justin Theroux and Etan Cohen) is a superproduction that parodies superproductions; a film inside a film. It has all the special effects and things blowing up, the epic sceneries and score (this latest one is a great work by Theodore Shapiro) and the superstars; the key-and this is all product of Stiller's intelligence- is how it uses them. It would be sufficient to say there's a big moment for the score (you could perceive it at the beginning or the end of the film; it involves Stiller in slow-motion), a huge one for the special effects and many for the sceneries (as we see helicopters flying and watching a 'jungle' from above in scenes that seem repeated but are different every time in a plot that never looses its frenetic nature).However, the stars of the show are, wellthe stars. Stereotypes are all over the place: Jack Black (crazier than ever) plays an actor who has only done comedy involving farts and has drug addiction problems; Robert Downey Jr. is Kirk Lazarus, a 'methodic' actor, committed to his work and awards (""Second Globe, third Oscar"", he says after he mentions a role he once played); Brandon T. Jackson personifies Alpa Chino, our typical music megastar that does everything and has to try acting because it can't hurt; and Ben Stiller is Tugg Speedman (or the same old Ben Stiller, but very measured and not at all out of control), the action movie man who has played the same role a thousand times but has also spent his whole career trying to be acknowledged as a 'serious' actor.When all of this characters find themselves immerse in this 'jungle' where they were once shooting a movie, it's fair to say anything can happen; and it's also fair to clarify that everything happens. Stiller lets loose and everything he keeps measured as an actor, he unloads it in the tone of the production and in every other performer, letting each and every one of them to explode. Nick Nolte and Steve Coogan deliver two short but unforgettable performances, Matthew McConaughey plays Matthew McConaughey and it doesn't bother, we have countless minimal appearances by famous and renowned individuals and there's a little- and brilliant-surprise (at least it surprised me). The film never takes itself seriously, but it's not stupid like, for example, most of the ""Scary Movies"" and films alike, which also try to mock genre pictures.Us, as viewers have to be thankful for that. As I said, Stiller doesn't intend to mock a particular genre; his target is the Hollywood industry. I also said he has no mercy, which leaves the fact of being brave or not out of the question. In terms of audience response, he could have been brave; and in a way he is because I'm almost sure that he did his best effort to make the most accessible movie possible.It's clear that there are references (yes, most of them are very funny) that not every viewer will understand (I personally missed the essence of some) and refer to the actual state of the Hollywood Stiller lives in and knows by heart. But if you don't get any reference, there's a plot that's eventful enough to keep your eyes focused on the screen and jokes that are just pure (innocent or disgusting-but intelligent-, because Stiller doesn't care which one is better) comedy.People laughed, and the biggest laughs came in those moments of original, crafted comedy that is funny without the need of mocking something. This is a little balance, courtesy of Stiller who knows that any superproduction should be made to be watched by anyone. If you like the approach towards the natural comedy, it means the film works; and it means the same if the references employed, developed (sometimes even detailed) at least make you smile: I liked both ends.It's difficult to direct a movie like ""Tropic Thunder"", which involves parodying something that's not as blatant and basic as the male model world. It's even more difficult to succeed in every expectation generated and fulfill every ambition presented. What sometimes is simply impossible is to set a bar; to function as an inflexion point in movie making; in this case with the comedy genreMark my words: it will be long before we experience something like ""Tropic Thunder"" again.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Terrific war/action movie spoof,"In order for a spoof to be a good spoof it has to be aware that it is a spoof. This however is a fine line as many recent spoof movies were a little to aware of the fact and presented simply a string of scenes each drawing obvious references and ridiculing other movies. I am not going to name names here and I am pretty sure that I don't have too.""Tropic Thunder"" is a spoof that finds itself on the good side of that line and that basically means it works are a stand alone movie. It is not a 90 minute string of pop culture references. It is more a spoof of the war/action genre (a la ""Commando"" with Schwarzenegger) than a group of movies. The opening scene does include a direct parody of a tragic scene in ""Platoon"" (which makes it hilarious), but the pretentiousness of non-stop simple gags is never felt. The film has its own storyline and characters and takes you on its own little film experience, rather than a re-run of previous films. In fact, as far as spoof movies go, this film does for war/action macho flicks what the brilliant ""Hot Fuzz"" did for cop action movies. It is funny by itself and is a real treat for genre fans.""Tropic Thunder"" in an interesting move also makes fun of the business of making big action movies as story here is about people making a film called ""Tropic Thunder"" only to find out that it becomes a reality. Tom Cruise has what is one of his best roles as a profanity spouting executive frustrated over the lack of progress in his ultra expensive epic production. And this is not just a cameo, this is a full fledged supporting role that is right by Robert Downey Jr's hilarious turn as a token tough talking fearless platoon sergeant (like the one in Aliens). In fact, virtually ever character and story element here is a stab at the genre and that is why it all works. --- 8/10BsCDb Classification: 13+ --- violence, profanity",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
