Amps up the action at the cost of almost everything else.,"I'll start by saying this film has FANTASTIC action sequences, better than the first even. Problem is, everything that made the first film so decent is basically gone here. The story is extremely formulaic and not really gripping in any way. Useless scenes and subplots are sprinkled throughout, especially during the college portions of the film. Shia does a good job as Sam once again but the rest of the original cast are either sidelined or written so badly you don't really care about them anymore. Megan Fox is especially exploited in this film, similar to the first Transformers but much more sleazily. Speaking of sleaze, the edgy humour of the first has carried over but where in that film it was fun, it has been toned up to borderline vulgarity. This film also adds quite a few new characters, some are cool, most are annoying and a handful are blatantly offensive. I'd give this film a 4 but the action really is worth a couple points. It's more of the first film but better, it's just a shame it's in a less consistent package than the first movie. Strong 5 to a light 6 from me.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"The sequel of Transformers is improved in direction, cinematography, effects, action, plot, duration, transformers, but is worse in seriousness compared to the 1st one.","Fantasy/action movie. The sequel to Bay's great franchise, Transformers. The 2nd film further enhances the action, the effects, but also the overall budget, since we are transported to the desert and foreign countries. Also, Steve Jablonsky's excellent selection in the music of the film and in the songs the top New Divide from Linkin Park continues. The second film is longer in plot and duration than the first, but Bay's lack of seriousness is also unfortunately reinforced in this film. He also makes reference to another of his great film, Bad Boys 2, through a large poster in the film, while in the first he mentioned the Armageddon. The threat of bigger, and more dangerous transformers, and generally all the elements are improved in this film, only overall it is less serious than the first, especially in dialogues and some characters. Better in action, effects, directing, but inferior in dialogues, so it remains at the levels of the first, perhaps a little below, but for different reasons.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Decent way to pass the time,"Yes, this film is incredibly stupid and loud, but that's what you are getting yourself into.

vfx treat,"transformers main lead is optimus prime and other autobots or whatever robots are there.Fans here to see robot action,epic visual,blast,loud sound effect,visual effects and all in all Micheal bay style.This film bring all together.Micheal bay is underrated by critics, i don't understand critics at all when i saw reviews of other Oscar nominated movies u will see some say entertaining,masterpiece bla bla bla its all lies last time i saw a Oscar nominated film after see their review i wasted my money and time they are zero entertainment even worst so please see it and judge it your self.After see all the negative reviews this film is blockbuster worldwide still we wanna see transformer 3 and now transformer 4 it already create hype when it first announced, so lets just agree we love transformer and Micheal bay films please don't follow critics its worth watching 2 hours 30 min just passed by just like that this is called entertainment 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What I expected,"I'm amazed at some of the reviews on here. Seriously, what did people expect outta this film? Shakespeare? The English Patient? You go to see this for the ridiculous action, awesome special effects and just to have a good time, which is what I had. Yeah, it did seem to overindulge slightly and was slow in parts. Yeah, the humour's cheesy, sometimes painfully so. No surprise there though, let's remember we're watching a film based on kids' toys, not a Bronte novel. It ain't perfect, but if you expected it to be, I'm glad you're feeling let down. For me, it didn't try to be anything it shouldn't have and what it needed to do right, it did.Mindless, thoroughly enjoyable fun, just like the first one.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Very sad, very bad","Most people before me have said this already. This movie stinks. When I heard that Michael Bay was at the helm of the first Transformers movie, I was very worried but then by some fluke of nature he actually managed to pull off a watchable movie, perhaps because he was kept on a tight leash by the studio.This debacle of a sequel is another story. Bay must have been given full power over this one due to the success of the first. Big mistake. This guy can’t make a decent, realistic and entertaining movie. He makes action/soft porn trash. A good script, story or dialog are just inconvenient afterthoughts for him and it shows. He probably thinks he can distract the audience away from these gaping holes by adding a lot of nonsensical action and unfunny humour.Sorry Mr. Bay you can’t fool people all the time and the people who grew up with the transformers are absolutely hating this movie. I heard that you didn’t want to make the first movie because you didn’t even like the transformers but you became very keen for the sequel after the first movie made so much money for you. Here’s a tip: lay off the third and let a real director and a real team make that one for us because you have just totally trampled on the transformers legacy.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
one of the worst,"No more Michael Bay, no more Shia Labeouef, maybe no more Megan Fox. When you attach your name to a project like this, hopefully fans will not give future projects done by these people record breaking box office feats. I'm embarrassed that I supported the cause.One of the poorest acting, directional, and written efforts I have seen in a long time in modern cinema.The scoop: This movie is good for a couple of scenes where the audience might be like 'cool!' due to CGI effects. There is a couple of cheap laughs from some other scenes. If that entertains you, great, there are lots of action movies out there for you. However, if you're reading a review on IMDb, you've likely separated well done movies from poorly done movies, and at least seen a couple in the top 250. To the reader, don't see this.I left the movies mad. I wonder what other directors think when they see a screening of this film. The story is near non-existent, there are so many plot holes, or unexplained courses of action this movie takes... it really is unbelievable that the script was given an okay by any film studio.Here's the thing : the target audience is obviously young kids or early teens. I think back to when I was 11 or 12 and I saw Men in Black in the theatres. I was entertained then, it's at least plausible that 12 year olds could be somewhat entertained by this now. However, I am still entertained by 'younger'generation stuff like spongebob, south park, and even beast wars. This didn't do it for me at all.Similarly to how family guy uses the strategy 'hey people love our interchangeable jokes in early episodes, let's overload our new episodes with the same jokes'.... Michael Bay employs 'hey people love the cgi and megan fox in the first one... let's overload the film with sex overtones, explosions, and fight scenes'... and then at the last minute tried to fit a story around it.This is the kind of film that makes a person angry that they aren't in Hollywood directing films, because most could do better than this.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Could have been better, but could have been much worse!","For the most part, this film is the decent thrill ride that the movie going audience is looking for. As an action moving, it has scenes to astound and thrill any avid fan. As a science fiction movie it stands reasonably well. It doesn't over-explain things and doesn't throw in concepts as central plot points that are blatantly impossible (super novas that threaten entire galaxies, I'm talking about you Star Trek). The movie also does relatively well on a comedic note, and from a standpoint of general plot. Though others have complained about the central importance of Sam's role being unlikely and a retread of the first film, it follows through logically from where the first film left off.Though the film is a lot of fun, it does have its flaws. Unfortunately the humor descends to the low brow a little too often. Also the Autobot twins that Michael Bay apparently loved so much were frightfully annoying. They did also lean towards offensive cultural stereotypes a little heavily. It is unfortunate because a couple of their funnier lines could have been delivered just as well by completely different characters. In fact they might have been funnier coming from a more straight laced Autobot. The use of the twins in pure Jar Jar Binks fashion (though not quite as irritating) was unfortunate given how many underused robots there were. The comment about Sam's roommate's bravery could have been unexpectedly hilarious coming out of Arcee.Most of the other glitches in the film were relatively minor and not worth mentioning, though the writers could use a geography lesson. If you enjoy action films and don't need a deeper artistic message, Revenge of the Fallen is well worth the watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A good sequel,"I personally think that this one is slightly better than the first, because it doesn't have to establish all of the characters. Having said that, the story is a bit lacking and I really had to pay attention to try to understand what was going on at times. There could have been a bit more of the every day Sam to counteract the more apocalyptic elements and give a bit of balance. It all happens very fast.I also think that there was too much ""Comic Relief"". We already had The Witwicky's and Simmons and to some degree Sam himself, the addition of The Twins, Jetfire and Leo was fine, but they didn't need to be so comedic too.At times it is difficult during battle scenes to see who is who and which ones are winning.It is a good film though and an enjoyable watch for anyone who likes cars and things being blown up.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Cinema in full perversion,"Make no mistake, a great number of people will be entertained by this flick and it offers, well, to say the least, a few aircraft carriers full of special effects for your money. Sadly, that's about everything good there is to say about ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"". Not only was the huge number of negative reviews for this film justified, but the second cinematic installment in the ""Transformers"" series is really paradigmatic of everything movies should not be.It all starts with the sub-par acting of Shia LeBeouf, which, by now at least, no longer comes as a surprise. Megan Fox, who plays the admittedly hot Mikaela Banes, doesn't really help either, as her role seems to be limited to bumping into stuff, falling and subsequently finding herself in ready-made bikini model poses, cleavage wide open. The story, if that is what we can call what little is left when we subtract 140 minutes of explosions from the film, is so blatantly drenched in in-ya-face product placement that even the most bullshit-resistant viewers will find it hard to look away.Now you might say: ""Fair enough, but wasn't the first 'Transformers' just the same?"". Well, here's where the real problems of ""Revenge of the Fallen"" start. While the original ""Transformers"" had some genuinely original, funny and gripping moments, ""Revenge of the Fallen"" largely lacks these elements. Most of the transforming and warping sidekicks are simply robotic versions of stale clichés, the humor has taken a turn for the worse and hardly any suspense builds up at all. It is this general lack of originality that makes for the new ""Transformers"" film to be so much less than good and entertaining popcorn cinema.150 minutes of random stuff blowing up without any real substance to the plot, cliché upon cliché, bad actor upon bad actor, and every so often a pseudo-moralistic lecture given to the audience by some over-sized pile of talking CGI-rubble - I can do without that kind of wisdom! Even just thinking about how many more people are going to watch this movie rather than one of this summer's real cinematic gems, such as Charlie Kaufman's ""Synechdoche, New York"", makes me a little sick!",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Not as Fresh as the Original,but Still an Enjoyable Sequel,","Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a good movie with a pretty good storyline and an average cast.Its definitely not as enjoyable as the first Transformers and it goes on too long,also an awful lot of the movie is very long action sequences,that go on for so long that after a while you don't even know whats going on.Shia Labeouf is just as good as the first,but Megan Fox is probably worse,I didn't like her in the first and I didn't like her in this,she is very attractive that is clearly the only reason she makes it in such big movies,because she can not act.Like the first my favourite actors are definitely the voice actors,they do a very impressive job voicing these strong characters,and the addition of the small auto it's was very humorous and added as a good comic relief.Fans of the first Transformers will be disappointed,but Revenge of the Fallen is still a good sequel.After leaving Bumblebee and the other Autobots for college,Sam (Shia Labeouf) starts experiencing weird symbols in his head that result in the return of the Decepticons.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Some aspects could have done with much more work, but it is not that bad","I quite liked the first Transformers and this film. Neither of the Transformers films are masterpieces, but neither are terrible movies either in my opinion. And yes, this is coming from a fan of the 1984 series and 1986 movie. Transformers 2:Revenge of the Fallen is not the best of the year, but it is a long way from the worst either(not like The Ugly Truth or Dragonball Evolution). And is it the worst movie of all time as I have seen in some reviews and various message boards? For me, not even close.Does this mean it is completely flawless? No. The characters are rather shallow(the twins especially, they are offensive too), the story is formulaic with some of the scenes with the humans on the dull side, the Autobots get nowhere near enough screen-time and some of the script is weak going overboard with some lowbrow and immature humour. In regards to the latter though, it does have a few humorous and exciting parts so it wasn't quite as glaring as the characters and story problems and to be fair to those two problems the original suffered from the same problems exactly.But when it comes to the visual spectacle and effects, I can't fault this movie at all, the whole film does look amazing and the effects are in my view some of the best of the year. And the action sequences are very thrilling, there isn't too much and it makes up for the not-so-involving exposition with the human characters. The soundtrack is also fantastic, and the sound is very impressive in its authenticity. The acting is an improvement, Shia LaBoeuf is likable enough and while she is far from a great actress Megan Fox has improved as well. John Tuturo and Kevin Dunn are great too, but my favourite characters are Megatron and especially Optimus Prime voiced wonderfully by Hugo Weaving and Peter Cullen. Another improvement is Michael Bay's direction, I can find it murky and unfocused but it was serviceable here.Overall, an okay movie that gets some not-entirely deserved but understandable flack. 6/10 Bethany Cox",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Transformers,"This second installment of the Transformers series wasn't as fantastic as the first one but it was still pretty good.

A lot of people didn't like this movie, but I did and I would recommend it.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Drivel. It's shameful that this will be remembered in the Transformers legacy,"Well, I enjoyed it as it happened, but after some reflection...I've come to the understanding that this film is very, VERY messy.A lot of people defending this film are saying the action scenes are spectacular. Sure, they're spectacular...if you like trying to figure out just who's who and what's going on. Most of the time the characters are so obscured by objects/smoke that you can't see the ""action"" that everyone's raving about. When they're not behind something, the camera's changing every five seconds that you can't focus on the mess before you. The only cool part about these action scenes is the intense way some of the Transformers are disfigured.The over-all plot, story, and script of this thing comes together in the most ugly way possible. Most people are complaining about it being too all over the place, or that there wasn't one at all. Unfortuneatly, it's hard not to agree on both fronts. There was no flow, no suspense, no build up, no up, no down, just one flat line of point a to point b to point c. The intense battles would have been made more intense had they been preceded by some sort of build up, but they just kind of...happened. The plot in and of itself has the makings of something epic. MULTI-FILM EPIC. The script used to flesh out this story was mediocre AT BEST. It could have been so much more than what it was, it could have spaced apart plot points by delving into the characters (specifically: the transformers). Instead, the film was littered with unnecessary, and often crude jokes.Heck, this overly cartoony humor was barely present in the first film. Now it's been ramped up to over 9000, and it severely offsets any emotional impact the film might have had. Most of it would have been better suited to something like Aqua Teen Hunger Force, at least there crude humor comes off clever. It's really sad we had to put up with all of that instead of enjoying some actual quality time with our favorite machines.And, speaking of which, the lack of Transformer character development presents itself yet again. You would think after fans complained about the infrequent amount of Transformer screen time in the first, then things would have been different now. Nope. We still don't know what they're thinking, who they are as living beings, or really anything about them except that they shoot at the opposing force. And why would they just sit around in car mode when they were hidden? They came from a planet where they walked around freely, one would think they'd enjoy being able to just be themselves.The annoying liberties that were taken here in the name of artistic licensing are nauseating. I understand this is an ""adaptation"" and that things aren't going to be 100% to the source material. However, completely rewriting a character's personality is like killing off a loved one and replacing them with someone completely different. They also went waaaay to far with appearance, as well. Being a fan of a character from the series isn't' going to matter much here because there's a good chance they've been overhauled beyond recognition. Heck, the only one that barely made the transition from cartoon/comic to this blight of a film is Optimus Prime. No one else even remotely resembles their previous incarnations. From personality to appearance, this piece of work tramples all of the work of those before it...AND the fans they had sought to please.The film's treatment of characters like Sky/Jetfire is utterly appalling. It's proof that the people involved in this film don't actually give a crap about the characters in their movie. Then again, the lack of character development makes that just as obvious.The character design here is also noticeably different from the previous film. In the last film, all of the machines were quite bulky, a little more humanoid. The new ones here all seemed to be cartoony or very streamlined. The mini transformers all seemed to sport bug eyes, where as the ones last time around did not. Why would this new batch, decepticon and autobot alike, differ so much from the others? It's not like they were all brand new, they'd been around as long as the others. I dunno, different art direction from film to film grates on my nerves, especially when it comes to character design.And, for the love of sanity, WHY can't they treat women like people? If I wanted to gawk at girls who were just there because they're pretty I would look up questionable material online. I honestly feel sorry for her and any other actress who doesn't actually get a chance to show off any acting talent they might have. I don't have a problem with them showing a girl as being pretty in the film...but if that's all they concentrate on then they can just get right the heck out.The rest of the talent on hand might as well have been treated the same way. No one was really given an opportunity to actually do much acting, it was all jokes and running.The movie's fun, but if you have a brain you'd better shut it off or your going to find yourself wanting to bring some pain to the creators of this drivel. And for the love of pete, just because it's an ""action"" film doesn't mean the film can't have substance. It's possible to have a load of brain-flexing story AND explosions.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Just awful,"This film has more of everything from the first movie, such as: insulting racial stereotypes, pointless throw-away dialogue and incomprehensible action sequences.If you handcuffed eight maladjusted monkeys to type writers you would probably get a better script. And as for the ""action,"" go to your nearest toy store, get the latest line of Transformers action figures, cram them into a blender and switch it on. That's what you'll get in a nutshell. Oh, and people running from explosions in slow motion. John Woo's action films seem to be in fast forward compared to this. Just because it is in slow mo it doesn't make it cool... unless you're Zack Snyder.It is hard to imagine anyone enjoying this film on any level, even the recently lobotomised. From the previews and hype, Michael Bay appears to be trusting the success of this film on the marketable qualities of Megan Fox's heaving bosom. Yes, gratuitous close ups of her chest abound.Michael Bay is a contemptible hack.

Not the kind of revenge i expected but still its enjoyable in many parts !!!,"After the success of Transformes Michael Bay & Spielberg is back with Transformers revenge of the fallen. The movie introduces new alien robots like sideswipe, RC twins under autobots & newer version of bonecrusher & devastator under decepticons & the most important more hotter Megan Fox.Movie starts brilliantly & grips you as autobots join the classified strike team nest & hunt for decepticons foes around the world, & on the other hand Sam goes to college begins his life along with Megan.The movie is all about matrix hidden somewhere in Egypt by the ancestors to protect from the decepticons around 1700 BC.Megatron returns to life with the only piece of cube left & the hunt for matrix starts between autobots & decepticons. The movie is has got some of the best action sequences & exceptional CGI graphics. My personal favourite forest battle, very well executed & amazing sound efforts during the whole battle. The robots looks more detailed & the action scenes are much more smoother than the previous one. Shia has improved a lot over this movie & of course so does the Megan with her killing sexier looks. Linkin park gives the best theme song in the transformers series {New Divide}. Steve as usual gives the best score for the movie, specially during the forest battle.There are few things in the movie that i guarantee my viewers will agree with me. The RC twins were totally waste in the movie & the old age robot at the plane museum, actually they were irritating & were pain to my eyes & ears. On the other hand whenever the movie gets serious there are funny moments which ruins the mood of the movie this is the problem i have with you Bay get over it please. The movie could have been much better with the deletion of funny humour in the movie but still in many ways its enjoyable. I would recommend that Bay should have showen robots are replacing or repairing their parts damaged during the fight like painting their bodies, replacement of tyre's.But still as i am huge transformers fan i enjoyed the movie, but definitely not as the first one for sure. I rate this movie 8/10 !!!!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"An ambitious, over-indulgent attempt at making the ultimate brainless summer film","When discussing Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, one must disregard discussing issues typically inherent to most quality films, such as plot development, character development, and acting ability, because these aspects of film-making are clearly irrelevant to director Michael Bay, especially after considering that this movie is his latest entry in a lengthy resume of largely brainless blockbuster films. Rather, one must discuss what this movie is, and it is Bay's attempt at making the brainless summer movie to end all brainless summer movies.Looking back on classic summer popcorn movies such as Independence Day, Indiana Jones, Pirates of the Caribbean, etc., one will notice that most of these films tend to have one of a number of common denominators that draw the masses to them; loud and expensive special effects, a healthy dollop of action-adventure, an escapist premise, and at least one source of T & A. Some are critically acclaimed, most are critically panned for whatever predictable reasons that pompous critics who write for alleged high-brow publications typically come up with. But the bottom line is, these common denominators compose a formula for box-office success, one that moviegoers eagerly turn to time and time again. Based on his directing credits and based on how successful his movies have been, it's clear that Bay knows how to work this formula backward and forward.With Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, Bay is not merely trying to top his first effort in the series from two years ago: he's trying to top every mindless popcorn flick ever made. This might initially sound like I'm overstating his ambition, but if one thinks about the movie for more than the five seconds that Bay expects your attention span to be, one realizes that this is the case.Bay's ambition must be commended. He knows that people don't go to see a movie about giant killer robots, or even a summer blockbuster period, for the interesting characters, or even a plot line that makes sense. So with this movie, he has masterfully attempted to eliminate all pretensions to the above, because his knows that those things are mostly irrelevant to bolstering a popcorn movie's bottom line. Indeed, after seeing this movie, all I could recall about the story was something about the bad robots needing to blow up the sun for some reason, and all I could remember about the characters was Shia LeBeouf's character running around screaming, John Tuturro's character making unfunny wisecrack after unfunny wisecrack, and Megan Fox's character looking unbelievably hot even while dirty and running for her life in the desert.Logically, this movie should be the best summer popcorn movie ever made. It's 2 1/2 hours of pulse-pounding relentless escapist fantasy. The special effects are amazing. The action is intense. There are enough shots of Megan Fox looking sexy to fill a few issues of Maxim magazine. It has everything a film fan should supposedly want from a summer popcorn movie, and it's all cranked up to 11.So why ISN'T it the best summer popcorn movie ever made?The answer to this question is a painful, age-old cliché. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is unabashed cinematic junk food in its purest form. Cinematic junk food can be tasty, but as the cliché goes, too much of it can be tiring, and will eventually give movie-goers a bellyache from over-indulging. But this isn't even merely cinematic junk food: it's the cinematic equivalent of drinking five extra-large energy drinks in one sitting: it'll get you going initially, and you'll be excited and maybe even a little entertained for awhile. But after the rush is over, you'll realize just how unhealthy for you it is to gorge yourself on something so shamelessly devoid of substance...or you'll become addicted to it and crave it even more.Considering just how much money this movie is likely going to make, it's safe to say that Michael Bay has addicted enough people to this franchise that he could likely get away with Transformers 3 being nothing but a slide-show of giant robots, explosions and sexy shots of Megan Fox. Don't tell me people wouldn't pay money to watch it, because people are basically paying money to watch it now.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An alright sequel..,"Micheal Bay said aight what does the audience need more of. And the audience's wishes were certainly fulfilled in this sequel.An ok story had lazy writing and a bad atmosphere.

The characters and their development fell of by a mile in this sequel and the new characters were annoying, such as that roommate and the autobot twins.

expensive looking empty hearted twaddle.,"i have to admit i was not a big fan of the first transformers movie. It lacked any discernible plot and was too long. Shia lebouef is never leading man material and meagan fox looks good until she opens her mouth and attempts to act.The new transformers movie is much more of the same. Its much too long and has the same problems as the first one. Its hard to distinguish between the good and bad robots in the big fight scenes. The script, such as it is, is padded with clichés and hilarious comic robots provide supposed light relief.I know revenge of the fallen is not meant to be some great cinematic masterpiece but its a blockbuster done badly. I like big dumb films. they can be terrific entertainment. Star trek is the best film of the summer so far. Big, bold and funny. The laughs in the fallen are lame and the major set pieces lose their impact due to the inflated running time.I sat in the cinema depressed. Meagan fox eased the depression slightly but if all a summer blockbuster has to recommend is a pouty pneumatic brunette its a sad state of affairs. 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Bay, as we all know, is still a child at heart...a VERY little child. Which means he finds things like sex jokes, explosions, and fooling around hilarious. We were unfortunate enough to have him put on the transformers series, honestly anyone else would have made them better. He took his inner child and spilled it all over this movie. Between robot humping, explosion after explosion, farting jokes, and overdone closeups of Megan Fox we can see the Michael Bay traits in this film. All this added together ruined a lot for me. At times it was almost hard to watch, especially when Sam's mom gets high which was not necessary, yet Bay finds it amusing. You all get the idea, Michael Bay is the reason this film had all it's negatives.Here is why I enjoyed the film. Simply because I love action. This movie delivered all of what I wanted to see in the first Transformers when it came to action. In the first one, we say very little fighting especially with Optimus. A lot of people saw the first wanting to see Optimus woop Decepticon butt, however he ended up getting HIS ass wooped. With Revenge of the Fallen, we get an all new badass Optimus Prime whose voice sounds like god, ""I'll take you all on!"". When I was in the theater watching Optimus during the Forest fight, the audience was rooting out loud for Optimus. The last time I saw that happen was during the 2005 King Kong T Rex fight.Overall, this movie delivers on action but fails on story which is what everyone else has been saying, but don't give it 1 star for that! 1st one had better story but not as much action, this one went vis versa. Big lack of character development in this one, way too many autobots, but it did not ruin the movie for me. What ruined a lot of it was Bay's inner child.My thought? I think Michael Bay should be pulled off the project and they should put J.J. Abrams on the project. See what he did with Star Trek? Imagine what he could do with Transformers. Let us all pray that Michael Bay does not do this again, or the 3rd movie will full out suck. Pray with me people.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The CGI Takeover.,"I would love to say Transformers 2 was excellent, i would love to compare it to the first one and comment on what they improved on. I guess i can a little. Action was spot on and much more clearer, cool slow motion shots when necessary and great combat between the robots. In comparison to the first Tranformers instalment it was a lot better. Improved and delivered well in that department.Tranformers: revenge of the fallen pretty much offers visual action at it's best. Fights, shoot em' up scenes and blowing up things. Effects again were mind blowing, just like the first one the effects were truly amazing (as you would expect) nothing has changed there. With offering all those many flaws, somehow it manages to slip everywhere else. Apart from the robots scenes (who had much more screen time compared to the first one.) It was all just a big waste. The scenes between the characters such as Sam Witwicky (Shia) Mikaela was unnecessary as nothing much got developed. Sam's family still had there touch of comedy, which was good to see. They were pretty hilarious. Also old characters were bought back into it, which was nice to see. New robots were introduced too, but there character content was a little weak. But something still was definitely missing, it wasn't the same. I preferred the way the first Transformers instalment was panned out, i missed the more immature ""human character's"" screen time.The film does have a long duration, but it didn't really effect me. It went pretty fast. I guess if you prefer a movie with full on fun action, then you will love this one. I suggest you see the first Transformers first though as it introduced the whole ""Transformers saga"" Overall i find it hard to rate. Were it succeeded in many things (action and adventure) i was let down in the many things that didn't remain from the first instalment (social screen time, comedy) Michal Bay again did well and delivered a good sequel, but i hope there will be a third instalment. It's a love it or hate it type of movie, Transformers fans will be pleased. Watch it yourself and then you will know.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Just average. Altho its better with a 2nd viewing. First viewing I thought it was crap!,"First, let me start by saying I went to see this on Friday night here in South Africa. And left the cinema absolutely gobsmacked at how terrible it was. Then the next morning my 10 year old niece wanted to watch it and her parents weren't willing to sit thru it and neither was I but they offered to pay for my service to accompany my niece and so I gave in and was willing to put myself thru it all again.And I'm glad I did, I actually managed to enjoy it the 2nd time around. Probably because I knew the bad points and they weren't gonna catch me by surprise. I must admit my expectations were quite high the Friday night, but once I knew what to expect it wasn't all that bad.The fight scenes, I personally thought were much more ""watchable"" than the first movie. A lot more slo-mo punches and such made it a bit easier to see just what exactly was happening. And of course, the special effects and general mayhem was literally out of this world. There were quite a few ""fun"" moments that made you laugh.And I don't understand the whole hullabaloo about the twinbots signifying racism. I thought they were funny, and it never occurred to me that they were based on black stereotypes. By the way, I'm black.Unfortunately though, there were quite a few points that need addressing when part 3 comes around. Most notable, unnecessary characters that do little-to-nothing to advance the story. And speaking of the ""story"" - a little more sense could help. I know its a "" fun summer movie"" but it didn't need to be a ""dumb fun summer movie"". The plot could have used a bit of tweaking.And the excuse that ""nobody comes to these movies for plot development, they just wanna see robots fighting"" makes no sense. Then they might as well have just had a 2 hour tag team WWE match-up in the desert quarry.Still I have to say it's worth a watch, although it could have been so much better.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good but not amazing,"Now the movie is hated a lot but let's look at what what was good 1:Gave us Sideswipe one this the gave us was sideswipe one of the most coolest characters ever. It also gave us fem bots sure we only saw like 1000 milliseconds of them but hey they're there. 2:Visuals were amazing i mean awesome sure they did look kind of fake but this isn't a real life situation it would a catastrophic eventWhile their were some wrongs i admit like all the Sexual crud but it's Micheal bay what do you expect Now the twins were kinda funny but a lot of people perceived them as racist but the twins did have some funny lines like ""It's supposed to hurt it's a ass kicking"" that was pretty funny in my opinionSome of the scene's were epic like (Spoiler Alert) The massive 3v1 that optimus and the three decepticons had (Megatron, Starscream and blackout) And the fight with the fallen and optimus and the shanghai part was coolIn the end the movie is good it does get somethings wrong but if you don't think of them and just sit and watch you have a really entertaining movie good movie",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not bad...,"""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" is an Action - Sci-Fi movie and the sequel of ""Transformers"", in which we watch Sam leaving Autobots and his previous life behind him in order to be another ordinary teenager. Soon he will realize that something strange is happening since his mind is full of cryptic symbols and the Decepticons are after him.I liked this movie because it had an interesting plot and it was a good continuation of the first movie of Transformers but it was not as good as the first one. The direction which was made for one more time by Michael Bay was good and he had mostly the same style as in the first movie. Finally, I have to say that ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" is not a bad sequel but it could be better with some changes and some additional information that could make it more interesting.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A complete hackjob.,"CGI and sound all are top-notch, it's truly amazing what they can do today. It is horribly apparent, however, that the guys behind this think so too, and wants to make that abundantly clear by shoving 2h of it down your throat, non-stop. And the initial amazement turns into boredom and annoyance.There is a laugh here and there, but other than that, what else makes up the movie is so extremely poorly done, there really isn't much movie here at all. It's like they started out creating action sequence after another with little or no respect to a story or plot, and then superglued it together with some subpar plot-fluff and poor acting. The movie is a near-complete hackjob.In all sincerity, with respect to the much disliked director Uwe Boll's quarrel with Michael Bay, I actually believe that if Uwe were given the same resources truly WASTED on this movie, he would produce something similar or even better.I also saw Steven Spielberg's name there somewhere. Which is just sad, given the man's earlier work.Personally, I will not waste any more money on these kind of movies ever again.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Understanding Denied,"There are two things to look for in a film, at least for me.One is whether it is important in the sense that it has life, matters, becomes part of you. This is rare, but so, so very valuable.It becomes possible because film is hungry for ways of delivering that power, so it grabs weakminded filmmakers and forces them to extend cognitive boundaries and refine new visual grammars. That gives us the second kind of interesting film — where the project itself is worthless, but there is some clear new thing emerging that by itself makes the soul tingle with expectation over how it might be used by a real artist.This and its previous version are such a movie. They contain something that I think is important. I mentioned it in the comment on the first one and can only repeat the observation here. We are seeing here the development of a visual style that is more than a style I think.In an ordinary movie, the framing and staging is expository: you are shown what you need to see to make sense out of what is happening. If it is a boxing match with Sly Stallone, you see what is essential: you see perhaps the possibility, the actor, the action and the effect. Its all there, very carefully engineered. In fact, this engineering — a very constrained subset of what can be photographed — is what constitutes the contract we have in communicating visually.What I first saw in ""Black Hawk Down"" was an engineering of what you do not see. Some of the action happened around us, the camera eye moving as if it were panicked and seeing only a part of what is going on. You could not make out the sense of what caused what. Because we so solidly expect to see everything that causes things, when we deviate it is a powerful statement.What we have here are transformations and fights that are only partially framed. We are denied enough information to know precisely what is happening. We know there is an exact order to how the many parts fold into an automobile or plane, but we often see just motion. The effect is most pronounced in battle scenes when the viewer would be panicked in the motion and threat of war. Confusion and lack of comprehension is part of the effect. It isn't just random noise though; we know that though the screen is filled with scores of metal shapes apparently in chaos, they belong to two beings. We cannot sort out who is who. We know that within those beings, the animators have programmed coherent bodily motion. We know that each blow is basically like those of Stallone, but we do not know any of the physics behind it, or even which way it is going.This is an amazing visual experience. I saw it in Imax. Sure, the film otherwise is ridiculous, and I find the cosmology troubling. But it is notable that while they go to extreme lengths to explain every point in the history of why these beings are here and why they fight, they go to equal trouble to keep the visual understanding of the fight from us.I think this is something new, and I can't wait until it is used in a real film.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Big Budget but small brains,"After watching the jaw dropping first installment I entered the cinema hall with many expectations but when I came out after watching the movie I was left with a feeling of utter disappointment and frustration.The story is ridiculous to say the least.The screenplay is pathetic filled with crap .There is a complete disregard for continuity and common sense.There is plenty of unnecessary stuff going on in this movie.I can recall only a single truly funny scene and the movie has no proper dialogue at all. Sure summer blockbusters tend to be no-brainers but this movie takes it to a new level.There are a bucket load of special effects shown but they hardly have been put to good use by the director.They are wasted on a lot of unnecessary scenes. Its saddening really because they must have spent a huge amount of money and put in a lot of effort to make these special effects. They should have used the money to hire better writers.Sure there are some awesome scenes especially the ones involving Optimus Prime and of course the transformations.Some action scenes were amazing. Some scenes still give you the goosebumps. But most of them are chaotic and have no proper direction whatsoever. What we end up watching on screen is senseless and direction less metal-on-metal action with a whole lot of explosions and robots just firing at each other from everywhere.The transformers still look amazing but they seem better in the first part.There a lot of new ones involved this time and sometimes you struggle to differentiate between the autobots and the decepticons.There are a few irritating transformers as well. The transformation sequences of the robots are not shown as well as in the first movie but are still incredible though, the sequences in the first part were much better.Megan Fox sizzles on screen. But she has been used too much in excess, no doubt to cover up the innumerable flaws in this movie(which of course she doesn't). Shia LeBeouf does a pretty good job. Apart from the military guys the other characters are horrible,dumb, painfully irritating and totally unnecessary.The climax shot in Egypt and Jordan is ridiculous.I sure did expect much more from it in terms of action.The climax in the first one was incredible and left you amazed. The direction is incredibly horrible. This is truly a very lazy attempt at making a movie, I think the makers knew the movie would become a smash hit because of the hype of the first movie and hence have come up with such a piece of crap.3/10...3 is just for some incredible special effects,some good action sequences and Megan Fox of course.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Great if you're a 12-year-old boy,"I went into this movie with moderately low expectations, but sadly I was expecting way too much. I figured the plot would take a back seat to the action and special effects, and I assumed the effects would be great. While I was right on both counts, I was stunned at how painfully long the movie felt - not how long it WAS, as I knew the run-time, but how excruciatingly dragged out it felt as I was sitting in the theater. If I hadn't been at the theater with friends, I would have walked out early on. Regrettably, I stayed for the whole thing. So many of the scenes seemed completely worthless, as they did nothing to further the plot. I was also surprised by the content of many truly inane, tasteless scenes: the mindless, grade-school humor, the borderline (borderline?) racist depictions, the jarring dialogue. These are all sins that can be easily forgiven if one is a pubescent boy. Michael Bay obviously knows his audience; it's too bad I didn't realize in time that I wasn't meant to be a part of it.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Robots Go Botty, Big Time.","Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen is directed by Michael Bay and jointly written by Alex Kurtzman, Ehren Kruger & Roberto Orci. It stars Shia LaBeouf, Megan Fox , John Turturro, Ramón Rodríguez, Josh Duhamel & Tyrese Gibson. Ben Seresin is the cinematographer and the music director is Steve Jablonsky.The Autobots and the US military have formed an alliance called NEST, their singular goal is to rid the World of Decepticons. But now they face their biggest challenge, because heading for Earth is the ultimate destroyer, The Fallen.Michael Bay has never been the most subtle of film directors, he knows how to have fun, and in the main he knows how to drag his target audience along with him for a slam bang good ride. After the hugely enjoyable Transformers film, and after its subsequent success, he has crafted a sequel that he felt needed a more is more approach, where everything is bigger and louder and nothing pauses for breath. The end result is a dizzying ball of entertainment that's sadly devoid of substance. If ever there was a film to be put forward as OTT then Transformers 2 is a leading candidate. The plot is thin yet unnecessarily made complex by the writers, who you feel are trying to be heard in amongst the eye candy carnage, while Bay even resorts to cheap moments of crudity to get some laughs for his film. His cast are fine, yes Megan Fox seems to only serve as a drawing in weapon for the randy teenagers, but she still works well off of the ever likable LaBeouf, who in turn continues to deliver a good line in action comedy performance. Pity, tho, that in a film that's so big, with everything expanded, that John Turturro doesn't get more screen time. Only he, with his visual comedy at optimum, can make a metal testicle scene seem less crass than really it is.When all is said and done, all the human actors are playing second fiddle to the Bots/Cons and metal critters. To that end the film is exciting, undeniably so. Sure some of the set-ups riff on other movies that have gone before it, but Bay is the master of Bayhem, there's just too much fun to be had if one is prepared to forgive its shallow center. With a third film on the go and set to be released in 2011, without Megan Fox (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley slipping into the considerably short skirt this time), it's anyone's guess what we will actually get this time. Will Bay pull back a touch and give us a story, with characters given time to breath? Or will it be bigger and noisier than part 2? You hope it's the former, but even if it's the latter, it will be fun for those after a certain level of popcorn explosive cinema. Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen is like a great ride at the funfair, one you have been on four times in a row. You know you have had a great time, but as your head starts to spin and your stomach feels queasy, you wonder if it was just too much overkill? 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
More of the Same,"Almost everybody has returned for this one. Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is going to college. He finds a shard of the AllSpark which has given him visions of symbols. Meanwhile the Autobots are battling the Decepticons with the help of human forces. However, the president's man is unconvinced, and wonder if the Decepticons are on Earth only to hunt the Autobots. And that maybe it would be better if the Autobots leave Earth and lead the Decepticons to follow them.It's good that both Shia and Megan Fox return as well as many of the others. The action is still over the top extravaganza. There're a few too many slow motion for my taste. I'd rather it speed by, and maintain the pace rather than sit there and gawk. But if you like the first one, the second one will give you more of the same. The big thing I don't like is that the Bots seems to be still kept a secret. That's really unreasonable considering what happened in the first movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Missing nostalgia of what we want,"So, I just finished watching the movie. It was up and down for my take. First, what the hell was all the ridiculousness of Sam's mom visiting him in college. Please, let's bring a marijuana reference to make us laugh. Come on, that was as low brow as it gets. Also, not to break up the fact that the effects are amazing, but it is extremely hard to tell who is who in this movie! I mean, give me more colors and an easy way to decipher whether these guys are Autobots or Decepticons. Say their names for God sake!!! I almost, nay, I do miss the 1986 movie where at least I knew who I was seeing and could root for or hate against the robots because I knew who they were. Also, what the hell happened to Devastator??? I thought I heard he was in this movie but failed to see him or any constructagons at all. Michael Bay, you do an amazing job with action and special effects so bravo. However, as a fan and as most people watching should be fans, it lacks on some basic levels. First, don't introduce ridiculous characters (the twins) who were a complete social shall I say rip-off of a genre which didn't need to even be there?? I'd rather take two robots who were just robots than to offend a race or ethnicity by what you did. Now, I'll just rant on what I thought could have been better. Megan Fox....you are dumb. She really did absolutely nothing and did not even need to be in this movie. Sam, (nitpicking now), could have been called Spike to start with since we all remember Spike from the original series but have no clue where Sam came from. Bumblebee...became a badass robot?? Should be smaller and able to freaking TALK!! Where are the robots we remember? Jazz, Hound, Sideswipe? At least you mentioned Ironhide. Did Shockwave just sit in outer space?? What the hell was that for? Yes, we saw Prowler, but no Soundwave? He was the bomb in the series. Again, and I can't stress this enough, there should be more mention to who we're seeing and more colors to represent who we see. Most decpticons were plain silver (gray metal) and we had no clue who they were showing. I think Michael Bay needs to sit down and actually watch a whole series to get what the audience would like to see. The premise and plot was good for the movie, but it was all over the place with random characters, weird enemies we didn't recognize, and robots who came and left and were not heard from again. I absolutely LOVED the original transformer movie because it brought in all the characters from the original series, gave us a good plot and scenario of what was going on, and brought in new characters and events that we could follow and enjoy. There will be a third movie, yes, I know. I already think that it will be another shoot off of Shia and Megan Fox and some plot dealing with just Megatron and Optimus Prime. Ho hum. If you really want to draw everyone in, bring in characters we all know, a LOT of them. Bring in the Dinobots! Bring in the bots that transform into the Huge bots such as DEVASTATOR. And please,please, make the transforming 'sound' when they transform. That was the standard and I actually liked when I heard that. Yes, you brought in a lot of action, suspense, and thrilling things to see. BUT, you left out what a lot of us miss, which is having the things we came to see in the first place! Bring us more characters we know and love, mention their names, even make the characters more cartoony, and not so machine-like. I like my polygons to be quick to recognize if they are a truck, car, or plane. Not take 3 minutes to see if they transform into a radio. All I'm leaving this with is I feel the fans of Transformers want what we love, not what Michael Bay thinks is the 'hip' kind of robots.

It's a shame I'm not an over stimulated 18-25 male,"Or I might have enjoyed this. I went in with the understanding that there would be a lot of action, but I also went in with the expectation of the same amount of human dialogue and screen time from the first one, if not more. I didn't care about the characters in the slightest, and it's because the main characters were no longer Sam and his family and friends. They were robots; poorly scripted uninteresting robots.

Could not watch after 30 minutes,"It's not often that I don't give a film at least a fair chance. But I could not watch this film anymore after the first 30 minutes. Where to begin? The acting was awful. Megan Fox and Shia Le Boeuf should not be allowed in front of a camera anymore. The plot was... I'm not actually sure there was a plot. The attempt at humour... was aimed at apparently no one. To be more specific: the entire dialogue and acting by Shia's characters mother... drove me insane. Zero point whatsoever to her even being in the film, let alone actually having a lot of dialogue and scenes. The Megan Fox Show aspect of the movie was completely pointless. And how many times could they play that agonizing Green Day song!?!?!? I think they played the song 5 different times throughout the first 30 minutes. The song is horrifying to listen to once.. let alone 5 times.Considering this film was made in a society that allows Britney Spears and Lady GaGa to have success, it doesn't surprise me that this film was SO terrible.But it is a shame.

to the critics,"i'm sorry, i must have misunderstood what movie you were commenting on. i was actually looking for a review of the movie ""Transformers 2"", and expected the commentary to reflect a movie based on a children's television program from over 20 years ago. Everyone has grown up since then, but the reason we go to see transformers as ""sophisticated"" adults is to reach back to that nostalgia - this is what we are after. movies are pieces of art that tell a story, sometimes these stories are fantastical/dramatic/philosophical etc., not every movie should have to fit all criteria provided by the movie critics who would prefer every movie to be citizen kane, or the godfather perhaps. in fact, if you went to see transformers and you have something along the lines of ""there was little character development - it didn't move me - the dialogue wasn't what i wanted"" it is you who are the lesser for having complaints when you should have known what you were going to see before you bought your ticket. it's transformers, don't try to make it something else - each movie/book/painting has its place - learn to like things for what they are",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Still didn't transformed me into a Transformers fan.,"Actually I'm a person that is always quite fond of Michael Bay movies. I like how he brings some overblown action entertainment to the screen with basically all of his movies. His Transformers movies however have never really appealed to me.But having said that, I actually have to admit that I liked this movie better than the first. It seems like they learned from some of their mistakes of the first movie, which also makes me somewhat more hopeful for the third movie ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"". If they improve even more, the movie could actually turn out to be quite good, as well as entertaining.Cause by saying I liked this movie better than the first one, I'm not saying at all that this is being a very good movie. It's entertaining enough to watch but that is it really. Everything about it is quite bad and simplistic but I'm of course not talking about the special effects though.The special effects are basically what Bay's Transformers movies are being known for. They are top of the bill and with each movie they keep pushing to the limits of what's possible and come up with new unseen stuff. They are innovative movies special effects wise and that's also why I often enjoy watching a Michael Bay movie; they are big budget ones but you can always see the budget back on the screen. Not only with its computer effects but also all of its action in general.And yes, there obviously is plenty of action in this movie. But too much though in my opinion. At times the movie is really nothing more than the one big action sequences after the other, which quite frankly can get tiresome to watch. After a while you stop caring what is happening, also because you often don't even understand what is going on. Not because the story is hard to follow but just because of the way the movie got shot and told. The movie is definitely too long as well, also because the last hour or so is being like one big action piece, that could had wrapped up things far sooner.But strangely enough the reason why I still liked this movie better than the first one was its story. This actually might sound strange because this movie its pre-production really suffered from the writer's strike. The story had to be finished in a hurry, while Michael Bay had already come up with some big action sequences to write a story around, connecting them all. So by all means, the story shouldn't work but it just all felt less random this time. Maybe it was a good thing that they had to come up with things in an hurry because when having more time, you also have more time to come up with lots of other crazy action stuff, like perhaps was what happened and was the problem with the script of the first movie.Also all of the characters worked out better this time around. Lots of characters and actors from the first movie return in this one and the movie seems to have found a better balance between their sequence and the ones featuring the Autobots and Decepticons.An entertaining enough overblown movie to watch but by no means a great one.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Micheal Bay...What did you expect?,"I went into this movie with very very low expectations, after all majority of Hollywood sequels suck horribly.That being said this movie is an ACTION film, its story is lacking but I still cant find anyone who can name an actual plot hole. A plot hole is like the scene in the Matrix where Keanu is on the roof and fires all his shots at the agent misses every shot drops his weapons they hit the ground and he says ""Trinity help!!!"" The agent then empties his clip at Neo who dodges almost every shot and gets grazed by a few, as the slow motion stops he falls to the ground along with his weapons that had already hit the ground. Thats a plot hole.This movie is not perfectly written (feels a bit joggy and doesn't seem to flow naturally) I'll admit that but this is also a Micheal Bay film, if you wanted something more then action and T&A then look elsewhere as this movie is loaded with both.I originally gave this movie a 10, yes it was a knee jerk reaction but at this time Id still give it a 7 or 8. It does what it sets out to do, there's action, cheesy jokes like in the first movie nice long shots of Megan's bits and pieces.This movie did what it was supposed too, however I will admit that the Autobots like Ironhide and Ratchet had very few lines :( and the Decepticons lacked introduction and development.I did enjoy this film but maybe I was not expecting as much as everyone else was. I wanted to be entertained I wanted to escape reality and realism and thats what I got a few hours to kick back and enjoy a film for what it does well.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Good film, watch it more than once and it gets better.","The first time I saw this film it was at imax and I was rattled after I left the cinema, I knew that I enjoyed it but I needed to see it again for some reason so I did at a regular cinema and I liked it even more. In short this is one for the fans of transformers, part 1 was great but it did not have the epic battles of this part.It felt like I was watching the cartoon again only better. It brought me back to the days of good guys fighting bad guys with no need for any more information. Thats all I wanted from this film and it delivered exactly that, Bay did a great job, so I wouldn't pay too much attention to those who say its bad, they are just stupid. I have heard a lot about the people who like this film not being smart, well I have 2 degrees and I loved it.

good! my opinion...,"what can i say! i've literally just stepped in the door and felt the need to write a review. Although i felt the movie was awesome, i still felt there were a handful of negatives regarding the movie as a whole.here is the handful of negatives!1. megan fox. her acting is MUCH better than the first movie. and i remember reading an interview where she actually said ""i've worked much harder on my acting this time round"". sam's mother is also quite annoying, but you either love her or hate her.3. there's a lot of scenes that were pointless. they could have easily cut down the movie half an hour shorter. so yes...the movie is incredibly long! make sure you choose a cinema with comfy seats!4. there's a slight drag to scenes.but the movie holds so many positives which is why it's a must see movie.1. the graphics are INCREDIBLE2. many believe there wasn't much of a story line???? they're WRONG. in fact, there's more of a story line the second time round.3. bigger and bolder characters. when i say bigger...i mean bigger! there's two that are HUGE compared to optimus prime.4. humour. the movie holds different types of humour: humour that will appeal to just the children, just the adults and both. so great family movie5. original cast members. some may hate this, but i don't. I like seeing the same people. even the guy from sector 7 is in it! who, might i add, is one of the best characters in the movie. but the only person i see missing is Jon Voight. which is no biggie because he didn't play a vital character.I honestly could go on, on and on. It really is a good movie. oh! and there's something really important that you should know. DO NOT WAIT FOR THIS TO COME OUT ON DVD. why? 1. Small screens will not give this movie justice. 2. i don't think it's a movie suitable to own on DVD. i wouldn't be able to sit still while watching it...it's sooooo long",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What is wrong with people?,"I don't understand how people are saying there is no plot. Hello, the Fallen wants to destroy the earth! Why does he? Maybe his evil mind was shutout from the Primes and he was rejected and Im sure he blames the humans. Megatron isn't too happy with us either. You cant say its stupid that they borough Megatron back to life, it happened in the cartoon! They named him Galvatron, but Bay couldn't do that because people like you would have one more thing to complain about not understanding. I understood everything that was going on and I loved the fight scenes. It was more than pushing and shoving, I saw a lot of punches and kicks, who didn't? I think you need to take a step back and throw out what critics say and formulate your own opinion. I thought it was hilarious when Simmons was in that thong, the whole audience did. If your saying the twins were racist why? I thought they were funny, if your saying their black or whatever maybe your the racist? I know white people who talk like that, there's no race to be intended except by the puny mind of people like you!

you know a movie is awesome when your girlfriend who hates action movies loved it.,"I just read through some of these comments and I've noticed that there are two types of people; those looking for an epic story centering on one man's quest to save the world while he realizes his love for his girlfriend. Also some robots are in it, and the fans that grew up with the cartoon and the toys, who say ""hey, this movie needs to do two things, look amazing and tell a cool story that will entertain me for two and a half hours."" I'm personally in the later side I loved the flick, hell I'll probably see it again, the CG effects were awesome, the acting was good and funny, and I had to time my leaving the theater just right to use the restroom so I wouldn't miss much.

TransfomerMania 2,"If the title of my summary doesn't make any sense, let me explain.I begin with..I loved the Transformers when i was kid..The cartoons just blew me away..In the 80's era cartoons seem to change..They had story lines..There was a slick little story behind all the action..GI Joe also followed this format to a degree..(Although as i waited for the movie to begin with the crowd, the GI Joe trailer came on..I heard a couple of giggles in the packed house..I don't know about THAT Franchise as a movie!!..but back to this one) The first Transformers movie..was a bit of a shock to my system..I though to myself(before i saw it)How is going to be any good??Can they make it look real?? Well Well...They gave it to the right director. and Paramount did the rest..Everything was damn near perfect!!So success(IE. money!!) breeds sequels..If my expectations were low going into tans 1..They were off the charts for Reveng of the Fallen..The trailers looked awesome..The main cast and Mr.Bay was returning..Everything was in place..Then the movie started,or should i say the action started..Now i am not the one to quibble about the plot doesn't make any sense or the acting is this and that in this type of movie.Its about fighting robots for crying out loud..and i did grade this flick at 7 stars..No spoilers here..as if you haven't already seen the movie..but i will just list a few observations..(1) For shear spectacle alone see this movie in the theatre!!(2)The ""twins"" that have caused the controversy.They didn't bother me that much..they were more annoying than anything..Jar Jar was much worse!!(3)Two movies in.. i still don't know anything about Tyrese,and Duhamels' characters..give me just a little more with them (4)I didn't know who was who at times..A little clarity at times would been helpful.(but)(5)I knew exactly what i was getting with a Bay sequel..If you have seen Bad Boys 2!!..With more money means more mayhem..SO give him a movie with 200 million dollar budget and prepare yourself!(6)Its almost TOO much movie..and i don't think i have ever said that in my life..(7)Shia,and Tuturro were good(8)Fox was OK..she is still a little green (9) Is it me or did Ramon Rodriguez(College roommate)have a bigger role in this flick than what was intended??? (10) Starscream..LOve that character!! To wrap this up..back to my title. I borrowed it from the WrestleMainia series. A couple of days later i was talking with the buddy i went to see it with and we wondered out aloud in Transformers 3 they should skip the plot altogether and just have AutoBots vs Decepticons in one big cage 2 HR cage match movie.. *And if they did that..I still be in the audience.. just like when i was watching Hogan vs Andre the Giant as a kid in the 80's..",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Revenge Of The Fallen......amazing!,"I played with Transformers as a kid like most other kids did, Bumble Bee was my favorite. You can guess the excitement I had when I heard they were making a live action movie as well as a lot of other die hard Transformers fan were. I was amazed at the visual aspect and cg effects used in the first movie. I was blown away at how realistic the Transformers looked and how they were able to move flawlessly. The movie concept and action scene were all top notch and went down as a summer block buster movie with good reason. After hearing critics come down on the first one because it was a ""Micheal Bay blockbuster disaster"" I could not believe it. Micheal Bay is an icon for explosions and action movies, some may disagree but hey, its an opinion right? Now, Transformers Revenge of The Fallen, simply marvelous. Totally took every expectation I had for the movie and multiplied that by 10. I first saw the movie in IMAX and was visually stunned! I was in marvel at a 60+ ft Optimus Prime in front of me as if I was in the damn movie or the movie was real life. I believe this is the best cg animated movie ever made, I mean come on, 160 TB of cg effects? That's never been heard of! Even the first one was only 80 or so TG. But, critics again bashed the movie. Saying it was ""A Waste Of 2 1/2 Hours"" and ""Michael Bay should hang up the directing"". This is all the work of self loathing hypocrites who have no better opinion for a well deserved film than to bash it or make it so that nobody wants to see it. I fully disagree with the bashing or mediocrity involving the negative comments towards these two wonder movies. I think Michael Bay did a magnificent job portraying the Transformers and incorporating the small things from the cartoon stories. I am most excited that he will do a 3rd installment of this film and think that anyone else couldn't pull it off.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
3D Awaits!!,"I knew this was going to have spectacular effects and action as all Michael Bay movies do; great script from Alex Kurtzman & Robert Orci. It didn't need to have a great storyline because all I cared about was fast paced entertainment and eye candy which it delivered on and then some. The only downfall, without trying to sound to harsh, was watching Megan Fox try to act. She's great to look at but I haven't seen her do any acting worth watching yet.Now, after Avatar exceeded everyone's expectation with his 3D extravaganza, I'm looking forward to what Bay can do with it. Decepticons and Autobots fighting in epic 3D technology will be nothing less than shockingly good.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Very good movie.... if you suffer from insomnia,"There i was in the theatre with a large coke and a bag of popcorn. I wasn't particularly blown away by the first movie, but it had great special effects and a somewhat decent plot. I figured: if it's on the same level as the previous flick i will surely enjoy myself.Movie begins. Chase on the freeway. Megan Fox on bike. Explosion explosion, explosion. ""Wait a minute... what's happening here?"" Cheap joke, explosion explosion explosion. ""Eh.... Who's who? What are those robots fighting about? How did those parents end up in the desert? Is there a plot?"" Then my eyes forcefully closed and i dozed off. The movie was boring.I really wonder why they couldn't stick to the basic idea of the cartoon. The cartoon had two factions: autobots and decepticons. Each faction had equal screen time. Once in a while the story would switch to the other side by means of an autobot logo switching to the decepticon logo (or and vice versa). The story centred around the robots and not around the humans. The humans were caught in the middle of the fight against their will, and were being protected by the autobots. Why are these movies so different? So, don't see the movie unless you need a good few hours of sleep.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Transformers 2 A Decent Sequel With Some Flaws,"Let me say that I'm a fan of the first Transformers movie. It had some flaws but I still enjoyed it overall. The same goes for this sequel which after seeing twice I actually liked this film more the second time than I did the first. Yeah it has flaws that were in the original but this sequel isn't as bad as critics made it out to be. It does suffer from a rushed finale (Optimus vs The Fallen), an abrupt ending, and not a whole lot of character development for the robots but that's all right because I guess they served their purpose. Most of the humor worked too except for some that didn't. Michael Bay is a talented director and he's admirable in giving audiences more of everything (giant robots, intense action, special effects and humor) in this one which worked for the most part. Labeouf reprises the role of Sam Witwicky providing his usual comic relief and he's believable as the character. Megan Fox is all right as Mikaela but isn't given much to do except to be eye candy. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson are back as well and they're good in their limited screen time. John Turturo is also back and he does a good job as the wacky former Sector 7 Agent Simmons. The rest of the cast are okay including the military and Sam's parents. The special effects are top notch and the robot action/fight sequences are well executed. The one that stood out is between Optimus and three Decepticons in a fierce forest showdown that leaves the Autobots leader ready for the scrap yard. The biggest flaw this movie has is the treatment given to most of the robots. Many of the new Decepticons including Soundwave, Grindor, Ravage, and Demolisher among many others merely show up for a few minutes before being destroyed or disappearing only to be killed off much later when they reappear briefly for the desert climax. The same can go to the new Autbots introduced too including Arcee, Jolt, Jetfire, and Sideswipe because they arrive early on (except for Jetfire who shows up in the second half) but then after that they only make brief appearances throughout the movie but their characters are okay despite only being given a few minutes of screen time. Even returning ones like Optimus, Bumblee, Ironhide and especially Ratchet seem to be fighting for screen time because the're MIA for large parts of the movie. Optimus isn't in it for a very large part of the second half but I was glad to see he eventually returns briefly for the third act so his character is sure to be back for the third one. Bumblebee like the other Autobots seem to be in their vehicle modes for a majority of the move but they do get their moments. Megatron and Starscream get a little more to do than the first one action and screen time wise but not by much. The two characters I was little disappointed in were The Fallen and Devastator. They both get at the most 5 to 8 minutes of screen time. The Fallen could've been a good villain but he's killed off in his only fight near the end by Optimus way too easily and he could've been a much more worthy adversary. Devastator had promise and looked like cool but the joke with the wrecking balls for his well you know I didn't find all that funny. Not to mention Devastator doesn't show up until near the end is easily defeated like The Fallen. Scorpnok makes a blink and you missed it cameo in the desert climax before being killed off as quickly as he appeared. There seemed to be too many robots on both sides but as mentioned before I guess they sort of served their purpose by giving the movie an action/fight sequence. The only two characters to get any sort of development were the Twin Autobots. I didn't find them racist like some critics did and they're not as bad as you might assume. More screen time could have been given to Optimus, Bumblebee, Ironhide, or Ratchet without them but hey thats all right. The abrupt ending left you wondering about what happened to many of the characters who didn't die. There was also a part late into the film where Sam gets hurt and then a second later his hand is bandaged up so this seemed like an error by the writers for not coming up with a better way to put Labeouf's real life injury into the movie. The ending does leaves the door open for another sequel but I hope if they do make a third film they improve the flaws that were in the previous ones. The humor was often funny (Sam's mom eating brownies) while others not so much (Dog/Robot Humping and the joke with Devastator). The movie was a little long but the action make's it move at a relatively steady pace though. Overall despite it's flaws Transformers Revenge Of The Fallen is a decent sci-fi adventure with plenty of robot action, some humor, and good performances by the cast. This sequel could've been a little better but Transformers 2 is worth watching and I still enjoyed it. So if you're a fan of the first film you'll probably like this one as well.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Bay drives the last nail hard into the coffin,"I will make this short. The movie is 2 1/2 hour long. The plot is close to retarded...sure, it sounds retarded to say that about the world of transformers which is in itself rather silly. But just like Batman, this could have been made intelligent and good. This is a good no-brainer action movie..sure. The first one actually worked. But the second..gawd!Plot holes are plenty and it's rather strange when the story is as thin as it is. You'd think it wasn't THAT hard to write something close to logical. Nitpickers will have a good time with this. Megan Fox is insanely hot though, she is the ONLY reason to watch this movie.If there is going to be third Transformers movie, let someone who actually can take the time to read through the comics make it and make a robot design that you can distinguish from each other... and not make it into another aliens attack humans movie...If there is going to be more Transformers movies, start it over.

I don't hate this one! My second favorite in the series!,"Following the success of the first TRANSFORMERS, a sequel was announced for a summer 2009 release, but had to go through a lot before it was released and the Writers' Strike was one of them and the film received almost negative reviews from critics.The plot revolves around Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf), who is caught in the war between two factions of alien robots, the Autobots and the Decepticons. Sam is having hallucinatory episodes of Cybertronian symbols, and is being hunted by the Decepticons under the orders of an ancient Decepticon named The Fallen (Tony Todd), who seeks to get revenge on Earth by finding and activating a machine that would provide the Decepticons with an energon source, destroying the Sun and all life on Earth in the process.The story is very incoherent, but I still watch this movie and like I said, this movie had a lot to go through before being released and I am not going to talk about this movie. My god, man. I can't hate this movie.If there is one thing I hate about this movie, that is a scene where Optimus Prime is killed by Megatron and I did feel some emotion in the scene, but I almost cried because he was killed and did not come back into this film until before the end credits come on and when he comes back, it is okay, but I just did wish they did not kill him off in the middle portion of the film.The visual effects on the Transformers are really amazing as hell and it was fantastic, but the CGI on the Fallen is a little off, but it is really amazing. The musical score by Steve Jablonsky is really amazing and the score is just fantastic as hell, especially with the other Transformers films and the scary movie remakes produced by Michael Bay, Andrew Form and Brad Fuller, this includes the Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday THE 13th remakes. The acting is amazing. Shia LaBeouf once again plays Sam Witwicky and he does an amazing job. Megan Fox is really hot and cool as Mikaela Banes and this would be her last TRANSFORMERS film, and I would have loved to have seen her play that character in the third film. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson are cool in their roles, too. John Turturro is really funny, but there are scenes that the humor is taken way too far in this film.Isabel Lucas as Alice is creepy and hot in the screen time that she has. The other person, Ramon Rodriguez is funny as hell as Leo in this film and I would have liked to have seen him in the third film as well.This would be the last film to be distributed by DreamWorks Pictures as Paramount Pictures distributed future films in the franchise.Overall, with TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN, I love and hate this film and that's pretty much it. I give it a 5 out of 10 because I have the two-disc DVD and I watched the special features and even the documentary and I felt sorry for the filmmakers and cast doing this film, but they made one hell of a sequel. Critics should have gave this movie a lot of critical praise for this movie.This is Michael Bay's worst reviewed films along with Pearl Harbor, Transformers: Age of Extinction and Bad Boys II.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Great Movie,"I really disagree with those who did not like the film. I respect the fact that you didn't like it. But come on, the director made a great job in this sequel. Even the story was new, I never thought that the story would be like this. I thought that it would be the traditional storyline of the villain who wants to have his revenge. The script is good. I agree that there some jokes that are completely pointless and added length to the movie. As well as, some weird jokes like farting. But look on the other side, the battles are perfect. Especially the one of Bumblebee, it was perfectly orchestrated, adding to that Optimus Prime's battle against the Decepticons, I have never seen Optimus so strong. Some of the scenes are close and quick, but we got to see the original forms of the robots. If there's something that I didn't like about the film, is that they gave lots of scenes for the army during the battles whilst they could have give the scenes to the other Autobots so they would appear more. At the end, I believe that the movie is one of a kind, and Micheal Bay did a great job. He resurrected the fame of the Transformers",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Good but not completely satisfactory,"After coming out of the cinema I usually review a movie. What feeling do I have. With this one it was difficult.

It is much better than the last Terminator. But for instance Star Strek was much better than this one (and I am not a Star Trek fan). I guess it was too long too much action.

Transformers: Revenge of the fallen,"I went into the showing of Transformers Revenge of the fallen with hight hopes, and i came out entertained, thrilled and wanting more of the action!This film was 200 times better than the first Tranformers which was also my favourite film, but after Tranformers Revenge of the fallen the first film has been de-moated to 2nd.The CGI was truly amazing, at times i forgot that they were computer generated. A vast improvement. It was also vastly better due to the fact that the Transformers appeared so much, unlike the first film in which they were more like Cameo's in this they where is most of the scenes. Unfortunately many of the new Autobots and Decepticons didn't get named, i only knew whop they were from finding out previously online.Prior to the film, there was a lot of criticism about Skids and Mudflap's appearance because they appeared to be designed like Jar Jar Binks from star wars. I found that in the film, they actually stood out as key characters and were lovable characters. This is the same for Jetfire, who was criticised for looking to much like an old man.Sam's parents, two of the humans i was really pleased to see again, both of whom played a bigger part in the film, and i am glad about this, i thought their roles really contributed to the film. This is the same for Simmons from the first film, as well as Major Lennox.Apart from a few minor plot holes this has to be the best film i have ever watched.

Bad films succeed when good men do nothing!,"The real problem here isn't that the film was uncontrollably terrible and a complete disappointment to fans of transformers both young and old. Its not the cringe worthy stereotypically raciest characters, or disgustingly sexist voyeurism. Its not the lack of plot, or characterization, or coherency. Its not even the heartbreaking waste of an opportunity that is the problem with this film.The problem with it is that good men should have stopped it from happening. It SHOULDN'T have been allowed to go this far.I mean think about it. The amount of pre-production and planning, the number of committee meetings, designs and redesigns, storyboards and shot discussions and script writes and rewrites that would of gone into creating this film would have been gigantic.

I am happy to say that Megan Fox plays a good roll and acting than the 1st Transformers movie. Well I don't know what all others who watched this movie is thinking.

Not up to snuff for a director that he should be,"It would seem that Michael Bay is looking to get into the soft-porn industry with this production. What ever floats your boat Mike, but keep it out of your commercial releases please. The film jumps around and has conflicts with the plot. All he relies upon is CGI and a low-cut tight shirt on the starring girl. I used to look forward to his films but now... I will be more discerning. Mikes become a pop-director who likes his product placements and his royalty checks. He's a sell-out who doesn't care about quality anymore. I question if he ever really did want to make a decent movie. And it would seem that Hollywood screenwriters are still in jr high and the palms must be hairy by now.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Are you not entertained???,"Some of the charms in the first movie are lost in the sequel. But overall this is an entertaining pop-corn movie, more budget and more special effects. You wont mind to pay extra money for that, because it is worth. The robots in the sequel are more humanize, more active, more naughty. Personally I dun like it. In the first movie, they were much more cool and charming. Anyway, Michael Bay,who usually do not care about character development and plot details, make another success attempt to give us an exciting Summer Blockbuster action movie. Explosion, robots, special effects, MeganFox, Shia LaBeouf and Josh Duhamel.... What else can you ask for??? Are you not entertained? Is this not why you are here???",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What a blast to your senses!!!,"I must truly say I don't understand what most people complain about. I don't know much of the original Transformers series, but what else can you expect than explosions, crashes, AWESOME animations, awe-inspiring fight scenes... I could go on and on.I think what did a lot for me was that I was able to enjoy this movie, as well as the first one, which BLASTED me and SO made me long for this one, on an HD computer screen with a decent sound system. It just blasts you! Again and again, one scene after another. The detail of all the transformers is amazing. The camera movements are amazing. Every scene with a Transformer in it could be watched again and again in 1080p and you would notice another awesome detail on them EVERY time you watch them. I'm not kidding. And it's not just the ""typical"" Transformers from the first one, no, there are actually some extremely out-of-the-ordinary ones that I think most fans will love. I certainly did!!Anyone expecting a deep story or deep characters will be disappointed a little, especially character-wise. But if you're just a fan of AWESOME animations and special effects, or generally love great CGI stuff, this is the movie for you. The point for me also was that the attempt of the background story actually wasn't that bad. I am used to some rather 'flat' stories from video games, and if you can accept that, it's OK. The background-story about Transformers-related stuff is truly epic, just not THAT well-elaborated.The humor is truly bad at some points, this is why I can't give this movie a 10/10 score. I would love to, but that would be dishonest. There are some jokes in the first 30 minutes of the movie that made me wanna puke. But after that, Bay unleashes a roller-coaster ride of action and awesomeness - this is actually much like in the first movie.The thing about the two movies is that you feel like you're 12 years old again. All this crashing and exploding and fighting and transforming that is going on just amazes me to a deep and satisfying degree. The WOW-effect of the first scene of the first movie was just AMAZING, and this second movie just tops it again and again and again. I also love movies with deep stories, but this is none of them.Accept that, await awesome CGI effects, and if you want to feel like you're 12 again - go watch this movie, with the best sound equipment and picture resolution you can get your hands on. It truly is awesome.EDIT:I must add something, now 5 months later. I corrected my rating from 9 to 7. The problem is that the lack of any story or depth keeps me from watching it again after I have seen every animation a satisfying number of times. The movie remains perfect for kids, and it remains perfect for fans of spectacular CGI art, but after a few times you have seen it.The lack of depth is a problem that's lasting, but the initial WOW-effect from the animations were oh so worth it.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
More of the same....in a bad way **SPOILERS**,"Well, this is a hard one to comment on. It was good, but not what it could have been. Let's start with the negatives: - Devastator/Constructicons have NO introduction. They just kind of appeared. - Too many unidentified robots. - WAY TOO LONG! The first was even a tad too long for a Transformers movie, so this one is just ridiculous. - Skidz and Mudflap are the two most annoying characters I have seen in a film in a long time. - Much of the CGI was actually worse this time around. The textures were spot-on and it mostly looked life-like, but the transformers seemed to move at a lower frame rate than the rest of the movie, making them looked stuttery. - The whole film ended with a bit of an anti-climax. - Megatron OR Optimus Prime should not have been resurrected. - Please zoom out, Michael Bay! At times, it is hard to see what is going on!But it is not ALL bad. The good points are: - The fight scenes are brilliant. It raises the bar yet again for CGI, but it needs to be tightened a bit. - Retains the humour from the first one. - The sound. The sound in this film is incredible. Much better than the first film, especially during the pyramid battle as well as the Paramount/Dreamworks bit at the start. - Scorponok has a really incredible entrance. You almost forget about him until he appears.So there are more bad points than good, but that is just me. The first film, for me, was a 9 out of 10. The only bad point was the 2hr10minute MINIMUM running time. This is 147 minutes, so it gets a little silly in terms of running time. Still, I hope you enjoy it.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
From the same guy who gave the world Pearl Harbour,"Summer is here which means a lot of kids who want to watch things get blown up to take their mind off upcoming exams. I can understand that. Sadly there is no excuse for making an incredibly long (longer than Apocalypse Now Redux) explodathon. Dull, boring uninspired just like the first one. If you prefer style over substance you will like it which is why the highest votes were from women under 18. Strangely one would think a film about robots would get higher votes from males. But anyway the fact majority of votes are 10/10 means that they are the type of person to be blinded by the shiny lights. Surprise, surprise that people who liked the first film will see the sequel.These types of explodathon movies are why films such as Terminator Salvation are so awful. Because it is what producers can get away with.""Hmmm, should we write a tangible enjoyable plot?"" ""You kidding?!, they want explosions. lets give them explosions...and robots."" Treat new films with high rankings on any review site with caution (whether it is genuinely good or not) My advice, is if you saw the first one you are forgiven and avoid this one.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A nutshell review on this summer's talked about sequel.,"Transformers 2 has had a lot to offer. Including the usage of more Autobots and Decepticons than the first one had to offer. As well as a continuing story from what was left off in the previous installment.In the sequel, the Autobots have form alliance with the U.S. military in tracking down the remaining Decepticons that are wandering around parts of the world. While Sam is trying to keep his involvement with Optimus to a minimum by attending college, however after encountering a piece of the all spark from the first movie. A great deal of information had raced through his own head, and Sam ends up writing symbols of a code to something that the Decepticons are interested in getting hold of. Sam who tries his hardest to live a normal college life finds himself involve with the Autobots saving the planet yet again.This sequel was slightly better than the first one, but it didn't get where it was suppose to in surpassing the original. One would think that Michael Bay and the rest of the film team would be able to know what the old and new fans of the franchise want to see in a Transformers movie. The only pet peeve about this movie was the scenes that weren't necessary for the story itself, most the ones that involved the humans. While there's so much they could of added for this movie. Maybe giving some more screen time for most of the Transformers or more scenes involving Decepticon hunting.The only reason why I gave this movie an 8/10 was cause of the usage of more transformers than the other one and the transformer battles which saved the movie from being bad. I would give it a 9/10 if they took out the unneeded parts of the movie and more screen time on the Transformer's side of the movie.There's always a chance for the third installment to be better than this one. But let's hope they'll learn their pet peeves and know what to include for the next sequel. My suggestion is include a battle royal of at least a hundred Autobots and Decepticons fight against one another, that's what I'd like to see for a third installment, cause what would be more entertaining than watching all of your favorite transformers having their own role in the field of battle.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
a more complete movie than  the first,"while i gave the first movie a 10/10 for sheer entertainment,this sequel is actually a more complete film,in my opinion,as much as this type of movie can be.for one thing,the story is actually much more interesting and more developed.the humour quotient is upped in this one as well.there are quite a few chuckles.some of the transformers are really neat,especially on the Decepticon side.the fight scenes between the Transformers are quite spectacular,though that isn't surprising.what is surprising is that the transformation scenes(when the vehicles change into their robot forms and vice versa were not seamless,and looked herky jerky to me.in the original film,this was not an issue.still,it's immensely entertaining.and despite a few minor issue.a better movie overall.as an aside,the movie is nominated for a Razzie Award for worst movie,which mystifies me.it's nowhere near Razzie calibre.oh,well.for me,Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Guilty Pleasure,"After seeing this at the cinema I gave Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen another watch yesterday, I know a lot of people who have seen it would wonder why I was wasting my time but I have to admit its a guilty pleasure of mine.We pick up with the story two years after the events of the first. The Autobots have united with the US Military hunting down Decepticons, when they learn of an ancient Decepticon that is coming to destroy the human race.Its not that I think the story should be completely void of a human story line, but I just don't care whether or not Sam, the main character, can keep his girlfriend while he goes to college especially when there's fighting robots in the same movie. The film comes in at a hefty 150 minutes run time, which I think even tests a die hard fans concentration levels, it definitely needs some trimming down in certain places.There was far too many rubbish jokes in there as well, although a couple of them made me laugh, the mother getting off her face with hash cakes and running loose on a college campus and John Turturro making a robot-scrotum reference were highlights for me, also the promise of Matthew Marsden coming on screen with his cringe-worthy acting is always entertaining but for the wrong reasons.You have to take it at face value though, its entertaining however you look at it.For more of my reviews please go to http://alansmitheejrmovieblog.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Spectacular action scenes more than impress.,"I would like to start off by saying that this was an extremely entertaining movie. The action was intense and it literally kept me on the edge of my seat with my jaw grating the floor! The CGI effects are incredible and really blend in well with the live action elements, very seamless.The story line is OK, far from spectacular. A lot of people are complaining about how believable it is, but the movie is about a race of alien robots who disguise themselves as vehicles! Come on!!! It has some very funny moments, the twins Skids + Mudflaps for example, along with the Witwicky parents add that comical element to the movie. Shia & Megan do a good job with some solid performance's and they really pull off a convincing relationship in the movie.The main problem with this film is that it is very long and I think they could have at cut out at least 30 minutes from this movie. A few of the scenes do not add anything to the film and left me thinking 'wtf was that about? Also, it is easy to lose track of all the autobots/decepticons, especially nearer the end when a load of them appear from nowhere! All in all, a spectacular action movie with incredible CGI. Good Stuff. 9/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It's so cool,"When I had heard everyone say that Transformers movies keep getting worse as time moves on I was actually very hesitant to watch this. I really liked the first movie so there was no way I could believe that THIS franchise could possibly be bad (although I did see that later on, I didn't see it here). In my review of the first movie I said how I got interested in the Transformers franchise after watching it, since I didn't know this was actually a toys company and not an anime series. If that movie was just the introduction, this was where the real action takes place.I saw Revenge of the Fallen on Amazon Prime soon after the first one. I only had one week left before my Prime subscription would expire, so I had only decided to dedicate this time to watching all the Transformers movies so that I could understand what this franchise is all about. Unlike the future movie this one actually expanded on what was established at the first movie. Although the human characters were not as interesting as the previous movie and the story was also pretty much empty, the action scenes completely made up for it.As usual the CGI and action was very good. The new characters introduced were fun to watch. I really like to see it when new characters are brought in and given their own character development as they transform into cool cars. However not everything about this movie was good. Like I said above the human characters were not as interesting. The entire blood about Sam going to college and his parents continuously pestering him was very annoying. This was the last time we got to see Mikaela, which is also something very sad IYKWIM.This movie was able to explain very well the entire concept of Transformers, something that the prequel fail to do so. Before I used to think that Autobots and Decepticons are supposed to be cars, but now I know that they are actually robots which can turn themselves into whatever they see in front of them. I would definitely give a rewatch afterwards sometime in the future whenever I have to show this franchise to a new generation.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A long transformation,"Yet again, the special effects in this movie were out of this world.The story was great, but it was stretched out way to long. There was a bunch of extra nonsense in the middle of the movie that could have been taken out.The fight scene that took place directly after Megatron's revival between Optimus Prime and the Decepticons was full of intense action and absolute destruction. It was the best fight scene yet between the Autobots and the Decepticons.The Fallen, the ultimate villain in this movie, is also a prime like Optimus. He was made out to be much more evil than that of Megatron. But yet, there was not that much of him in the movie up until the very end of the movie. All that hype was for really nothing. It was the same mistake made in the first movie with Megatron's character.Despite the length of the movie and the short lived screen life of The Fallen, the movie was not bad. The special effects are much better than that of the first movie. There is also a difference in the voices of the Transformers; they sound more humanistic than robotic now.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This film is a must see for every Transformers fan!,"The scenario is more or less passable, the acting is basically the same as in the first Transformers movie, there are some ridiculous moments and some errors in geographical locations where the action takes place.But the thing is that when you see the fights of Autobots and Decepticons in this movie, your jaw will drop and stay that way for two and a half hours until you see the end credits. Any real fan of the original Transformers was waiting to see this on a big screen - a full scale war between the large robots that hasn't been really delivered in the first movie.There are so many new Transformers around this time, they fight and destroy each other in unbelievably detailed battles from the beginning till the end of the movie. If you really like the franchise, this is the one film to watch: it's as if the Michael Bay and producers have heard the fans and did everything to make the movie for them.

"Fun Movie, good action, Terminator was better","Well I would have to say the first Transformers was pretty damn good and seeing the trailer for the second one showed that they are trying to up the action level and maybe explain the story a little better. Well they do this OK. Its not what I expected. I did enjoy this movie. It was very fast paced, with extremely well done special effects. Sometimes the story got a little out there, which unfortunately you do think about it watching the movie. Most times you would like to think back after you've seen the movie to review the story, well that doesn't happen so don't be surprised if you start to review the movie before its over. The characters are mostly just there. The only person you really care about is Sam because well he is the only real character in the movie. Megan Fox seemed way way too fake in this movie. Just watching her makes you think she is a total b*tch in real life. She was only eye candy in this movie. Again the special effects are top notch in this movie. They were about the same professional wise as terminator salvation's were. It did seem sloppy at times and it was hard to tell who was fighting who and who really to root for. That didn't distract me too much. The only two things that bothered me the most about this movie is its split audience attraction. With the 2 gangster robots and there dialog and childish behavior you would guess this movie would be PG. Then all the sudden the robots would start cussing and swearing and talking ghetto. The movie would start to look dark and evil and move to its PG-13 rating. It didn't stay consistent all the way through. The second thing that bothered me was the cliché's of right place right time in every instance in this movie. There would just happen to be the ""right"" missile on a ship that just would happen to be close to where the action was. They would all be prepared to handle this unexpected and unlikely event. You knew Optimus was going to live again to see the final climactic battle yet the battle was short and pretty pathetic and expected. Now I did like this movie and sequels are hard to be as incredible as the first movies. Its rare to see newer movies these days that can be moving and worthy as some of our past classics that are available to us. I would say that many people are going to hate this movie and many people are going to love it. Me... I like it, nothing incredible nothing horrible, just there for me. I thought between to two summer blockbusters Terminator Salvation was much better but thats just me. I give it a 7 out of 10 because for what it is... it does its job I guess.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good movie although nothing like the original.,"Overall this is a good movie. People complain about it being bad just because it is nothing from the original TV series, but who cares it is a movie. If people would stop comparing movies to books and the originals they can see that it really is not a bad movie. The special effects are overwhelming and both movies have a spectacular soundtrack.I love this movie and I wish people would stop comparing it to the originals.

The two gang banger robots are not funny just because they talk about farts and genitals. Sam's parents are annoying as hell and the dogs hump hardy har har. #3 Megan Fox. Yeah she's hot but she can't act to save her life. #4 The action sequences are bleary and nauseating. #5 Michael Bay does not know the difference between story and specal effects. He is what makes this atrocity so atrocious. He shouldn't just never be allowed to make another movie again, he should be arrested for releasing this monstrosity upon the world. SHAME ON YOU Mr. Bay. #6 It's way too long. It's not like the Lord of the Rings which was a masterpiece and had a reason for being so long. This just goes on and on and leads to nothing.

Excessive Profanity Unnecessary,"I am a true fan of the Transformer movies but I have to say that Transformers 2 was very good with the exception of the excessive profanity. The first version did not contain so much use of harsh (adult) language. Within the first five minutes or so, the autobots were using such language as ""hell"", ""G--Dam--"", ""bit--""; totally unnecessary for the type of family movie this was supposed to be. I can hear the writers justifying the use of the harsh language to suggest it was more realistic; I disagree. Parents please be mindful of this if you plan on allowing your children under the age of 14 to see this movie. Other than then that, I really liked the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The plot-holes Bay makes leaves much bigger craters than his explosions.,"Michael Bay was so fittingly named the 'true Decepticon' by Rolling Stone critic Peter Travers, he truly ruins everything that anybody anywhere could ever truly like about this whole franchise; he makes Shia LeBeouf into this adventurer that didn't remind me anything of the character of the first movie, Megan Fox is sun bathed into becoming a underused but still terrible character, the robots are becoming less and less mechanical and more and more organic, the action scenes are a whole lot of mess, the sidekicks (whether it's the new twin-robots, John Turturro or nerdy schoolmate Leo Spitz (Ramon Rodriguez)) are all instruction manuals to creating horrible characters with perfectly timed unfunny lines - I could go on forever about this.I found out more interesting things about my teeth during this watch than whatever Bay could throw at me on screen. It's exhausting duration-time does not help out when there's really no climax to appear, scene after scene after scene Bay tries topping himself with explosions, shiny cars, ""funny"" one-liners, robot-fights where it's impossible to tell who's fighting who, an outrageously bad love story and a dooming story that uses bogus words to get out of a clamp. And for that matter, director Bay doesn't seem all that interesting in story, he is far more interesting in going out on the highway (again!) and making those wheels screech, or loading-up military weapons with our men Josh Duhamel and Tyrese; the plot-holes he makes leaves much bigger craters than his explosions.Using this kind of budget, and having so many ideas to pull from, we're left with what may just be the worst sequel of all time. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen does not manage to make one good scene; that's what I call a horrible mess.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Ha! 'Haters', Eh?","This movie, more or less, was a waste of a decent popcorn-fodder film. It was disjointed, sophomoric and should not have been able to receive a 'PG-13' rating from the MPAA.Bay clearly has a fondness for our Military, and for that, I am thankful. And there were a few interesting moments on the outset of the film, but they were quickly overshadowed by oversexed college students, silly, sophomoric humor that was all but devoid of taste, and sub-par writing delivered by even worse 'acting'. Bay knows how to blow crap up, and do it well. But wow, did he drop the ball with this one.The silly thing is that one even has to say these things about a film like this. It's a movie about giant robots from a planet called Cybertron. One should not even have to comment on a film like this in such a way. That's what makes the film such a sad state on the affairs of Hollywood today. That one has to point out the crude, tasteless, pointless film-making of a movie about a Hasbro toy.Hollywood, shame on you for making a film that should be fun and a nice escape into something that any sane parent with half of a brain will have to seriously consider (and I hope, decide against) whether or not to take their children (13 and up) to see.I'd rant about the film more.

Best Tranformers movie yet!!,"Everyone knows critics don't have anything good to say about action/sci-fi movies. So therefore, I wont even bother reading their reviews. Ionly read user reviews as regular people are more trustworthy about their reviews. That being said, I really enjoyed this movie and thought it was well worth the money compared to all the other movies out this year. There are some parents who say this movie was bad for kids or whatever, bad it did have a pg-13 rating that says ""intense sequences of sci-fi action violence, language, some crude and sexual material, and brief drug material."" So no one should complain about the ""bad words"" or ""sex"" or whatever that was in the movie. Other than all the complainers saying this movie didn't have a plot or whatever, should know that the first movie was made the same way, not really a big plot just action and graphics.

Someone needs a geography lesson!!,"I've voted a 6, which is perhaps a little low - maybe 6.5 - 6.8, but for me this was a little disappointing. What I really liked about the first one was that it was serious, with non- forced humour. This one for me was less serious, with terribly forced humour - it's the difference between Star Wars a New Hope & the Phantom Menace. In fact the difference didn't stop there, as just as Lucas put in the awful Jar Jar Binks, Bay/Spel put in two similar silly autobots - the names of which escape me. And to be honest, on reflection, that was another issue - whilst watching the movie I had no idea which robot was which. In the fight scenes it was difficult to tell them apart, it all looked quite scrappy - unlike the first one, where each robot seemed more individual.Now to my main bug bear - and yes I know it's just a movie.... However, the pyramids, the red sea & Petra are no where near each other!!! It would take days to walk from the Pyramids to the red sea, and even longer to walk to Petra - I know, I've been to all of them!!! In addition Sam seemed at one point to be running through Karnak temple??? Luxor is even further!!! Things like this just don't make the movie seem credible & it's sad to think that kids are now going to believe all these things are in the wrong place. I certainly get the feeling that Americans (and I am very pro American btw), do feel that if it's not in the USA, then it doesn't really matter about the accents/locations - I mean for them if it's in the same continent then thats enough - however I think if someone came out with a movie that had the star running from the Empire State Building to the Sears Tower, then they'd think that was very silly and unbelievable - and they'd be right!!!Overall I did enjoy it - but no where near as much as I did the first one, and part of me senses a Batman-esquire similarity, where we started with a couple of great dark moody Gothic Batman movies, but then descended in to comic-book tripe (Batman & Robin.... yuk...!!) - before it was rescued by Christian Bales latest excellent movies.Please don't let this happen to Transformers... Make it more serious, non-forced humour - no stupid/camp autobots - and I think one slow-motion shot of Sam running is perhaps enough for one movie.....",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A shamefully trite and pointless film,"I didn't think a film could be any worse than the first Transformers stinker, which destroyed in one sad Hollywood bomb a franchise for which I had fond memories. I didn't think the shameless corporate advertising and abominable military propaganda from that film would be repeated. Then I remembered having seen 4.2 minutes of Pearl harbor (completely by mistake; I was waiting for my tires to be rotated) and shuddered.Yes, Michael Bay can make worse cinema than the first so-called Transformers film.And so he did. I have never before witnessed such trite and random comic relief than what this film offers (OK, a middle-aged woman whining that things suck? the same woman repeatedly using adolescent curses? the WWE-style trash-talking between robots?), and I had no idea you could pack hundreds of instances of such superfluous nonsense into just one instance of cinema.If that's not enough to put you to sleep, add in about 35 minutes' footage of robots transforming. Sorry; not interesting. Not even a 2-year old will remain engaged after the first drawn-out alteration. I know this for a fact; mine fell asleep 7 minutes into the film. I joined her for about 20 minuted at the beginning of the second hour and was very ticked off to find I hadn't missed anything.I won't go off on the military recruitment propaganda anymore - if you're too stupid to see through it yourself that's your problem.The final word on this film: good thing I stole it. No single person is more deserving of having his 'art' stolen than Michael Bay, and no studio deserves to sell one less ticket than Paramount for having allowed such utter trash to be distributed to the public.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""I rise, you fall!""","Customary to any sequel in a major franchise, the action must be bigger, badder, and more epic. The story has to broaden. The conflict has to be ramped up more than before. I don't think anybody would argue that ""RotF"" fails in this field; the action is easily more impressive than the first film. From the incredibly massive chase scene in Shanghai to the epic finale in Egypt, the film takes us on an epic journey all over the world, blowing more s**t up, and causing unprecedented amounts of mass carnage! Entire highways are reduced to rubble, an aircraft carrier is ripped in half, the ancient pyramids are desecrated; these are incredible scenes that may never be topped (well, except for the next ""Transformers"" film).This film has been panned by audiences and critics for a number of reasons though. In their efforts to make things bigger, fill up the film with shedloads of new ideas, and take the story to multiple locales, the filmmakers may have indeed neglected to make the story congeal and flow as properly as it should. Some folks claim that the film has no story, but that's pure exaggeration; the story's quite clear-cut to me, just too much all over the place. If they toned the story down and maintained a steadier focus, the story would have probably would have won more hearts. Not to mention the myriad of lesser nitpicks; one too many crude jokes, perceived plot holes and inconsistencies, questionable mythology, the twins, etc.Personally, the issues regarding the story, humor, plot, characters, and everything else has never bothered me. If it wasn't for the Internet, I might have never known this movie sucks! Suffice to say, none of this has ever hampered my enjoyment of the film, and it hasn't affected my opinion of the plot. In my opinion, the plot works in its own inherent way. Just as a sequel should, it showcases the villains having their glory, while continuing the main character's development. The film is admittedly overblown in a lot of ways, but I love it anyway.Like before, the film has gorgeous picturesque photography and some very fast and hectic editing. Editing can be a little screwy, as certain shots are repeated or recycled from the first film. Altogether though, I think the action is better-framed and it's much easier to see the robots than from the first film. Acting is about as strong or as weak as before; Shia LaBeouf is still semi-lovable and semi-annoying. I think Megan Fox puts on a stronger performance here (or perhaps is more likable, or else has more material to work with; either way, her presence is stronger). John Turturro, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, Peter Cullen, and Hugo Weaving all return and are decent. Production value is still insanely high, with no expense spared on sets, props, costumes, special effects, or all the genuine military hardware and personnel on display. Aside from one or two iffy rock songs, the music is quite smashing.Given all the hate this films receives, I can only recommend it as a rental.4/5 (entertainment: 5/5, story: 3.5/5, film: 4/5)",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What an awful movie!,"Similar to Transformers (2007), I watched this movie in the theater back in 2009 and I remembered loving it. Now that I've rewatched the movie for this review, I have to say that Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009) is an absolute trainwreck of a movie.Positives for Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009): Peter Cullen, Hugo Weaving and Tony Todd are very good as Optimus Prime, Megatron and The Fallen respectively in this movie. Shia LaBeouf, Megan Fox, Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gidson are pretty decent as the human characters in this movie. And finally, the action sequences are a lot of fun in this movie.Negatives for Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009):
Now to be fair, this movie was rushed into production during a writers' strike and even Michael Bay himself admitted that he was disappointed with the movie. It literally feels like the movie is making stuff up as it going along and all of it is either a waste of time or completely useless. Aside from that, this movie goes full Bayhem with all of the traditional cliches in a Michael Bay movie. First off, Sam Witwicky starts seeing Cybertronian symbols after touching the shard of the AllSpark which makes no sense given that this guy was holding the AllSpark in the last movie. Sam's parents are even more annoying and irritating in this movie than they were in the first one. Ramon Rodriguez as Leo Spitz is also incredibly annoying in this movie. Mudflap and Skids are among some of the most racist characters I've seen in any Michael Bay movie ever and trust me that is saying a lot. The death of Optimus Prime holds no weight because we know he's going to be resurrected by the humans and it was also spoiled in the movie's marketing. The main villain of The Fallen is barely in the movie and it makes you question as to why they casted Candyman himself Tony Todd as this character. You also have that gigantic Decepticon Devastator that was heavily advertised in the marketing and aside from a stupid battle with Mudflap and Skids and revealing the harvester, the movie does nothing with him and he gets destroyed very quickly. The humor in this movie is even worse than the first one. And finally, the final battle between Optimus Prime, Megatron and The Fallen is one of the most anti-climatic final battles I've ever seen in any movie.Overall, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009) is an absolute joke of a movie that had no idea what it wants to do mostly because of the writers' strike and that's very unfortunate for everyone involved with this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
action packed robot film,"Along time ago robots came from outer space and wanted to destroy the sun to get its energy.But having discovered humans on earth the Transformers divided into those that would destroy the sun and also the earth and those who won't.It is basically a war between the robots with humans caught in the middle in different famous locations.There is some great acting, especially from Shia LaBeouf, Megan Fox, Tyrese Gibson and Josh Dunhamel.The animation and special effects are some of the best of the year This is a great action film.

Very harsh comments from some users!,"OK so I went out and watched Transformers Revenge of the fallen WITHOUT reading some of the quite frankly, funny reports on this movie.I wasn't all that impressed by the first movie which I think lowered my expectations somewhat for this second one.OK, so there are some holes in the plot, there are some very cheesy moments, especially when Sam has an out of body experience with ""the primes"".BUT!!! come on what do you want from what is historically a KIDS series and rated a 12a???? There are people on here banging on like they are all film critics, Michael bay this, Michael bay that! Its hilarious really.Transformers Revenge of the fallen is a good action movie, plenty of action, Optimus prime actually does himself justice in this movie, not like in the first when he was quite frankly a bit of a wimp, there is plenty of humour to go along the way (which was greeted with laughter from the cinema crowd, always a sign people are appreciating the humour involved) and overall I didn't feel it felt like 2 and a half hours (suprising considering the speakers in the cinema weren't working completely so we lost some of the surround sound effects!!) And and Megan Fox is just Hot, and who doesn't want to look at that!! Overall. I don't think this movie is a 9, but I rated it as such because of some of the pathetic reviews on here. Its more a 7.8 which is still a good movie. If you want action and light humour, go see it, you'll enjoy it, and ignore some of the would be film critics on here.

"All special effects, no juice.","'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen'. Not a great movie. I attended a screening last night, and all I can say is this is definitely not something I should've waited 1.5 hours in line for. Almost 800 people attended, and were very disappointed when not let in. They didn't miss anything but a piece of work pretty much only showcasing nothing but great special effects, and other stuff that you see in every regular movie.This movie includes jokes that were not too funny, lazy writing, above average direction, pretty good acting, and a dragged-out story. It seems as if the people making this thought adding special effects would cover up for their other weak areas. They were wrong.As for the characters/actors...I am SO glad Mikaela did more than stand around in this movie. She actually HELPED Sam. That is one improvement from the first movie. Shia Labeouf did a great job of making Sam much more mature and less naive than he was in the first movie.Overall, not too impressed. Way below my expectations. You disappointed me, 'Transformers'. Wished it was more juicy.Overall rating: 6.04/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good to Watch,"With all the special effects and a mix of action, romance, humor and fiction, this movie is Good To Watch ( at lest once ).The character of Optimus Prime steals the show as always. The transformations still seem to keep the audiences hooked up to the screen.Though it is basically an action, fiction cum special effects movie, it still clings to a good enough if not an awesome story. The climax is a little overplayed with typical romance creeping in.The end leaves path for another sequel. It's not like dooms day and has left of loose ends to build upon.The characters have been played well. Romance might not have been entirely necessary in the movie but it does not hurt. The good and bad transformers have a clearly distinct from each other.It's a movie worth a watch. Definitely some value for the bucks you spend!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Revenge of the Wasted Potential,"While the first Transformers film was a take-off/spoof of the Spielbergian 'kids + alien' sub-genre, Bay's sequel tries to be more of a 'Indiana Jones'-style globe-trotting adventure. (It's interesting that this this films was released only one year after Kingdom of the Crystal Skull; both star Shia LaBeouf and both are constructed as loosely connected vignettes built around a surplus cast of useless side characters. This Spielbergian sub-genre officially died here.)This structure is how the initial disappointment sets in; it's deliberately banal, as if the screenwriters had no idea what to make the movie about and so threw together a grab-bag of ludicrous plot elements involving the Matrix of Leadership, dream symbols, ancient history, All-Sparks, Sun destroyers---recent audiences will recognize this same tactic from the wretched Star Wars Rise of Skywalker. This problem does not automatically stem from the fact this is a 'Transformers' movie---the very title 'Revenge of the Fallen' suggests something almost Milton-esque, but the storytellers obviously have no clue how to construct an epic narrative to match the oversized heroes. That's failure number one.The other failures mostly rest on the shoulders of Michael Bay, who neglects the (for him) restraint of the first film and plows full speed into inanity. His fine eye for composition is still evident in the action scenes, but they're mostly so long, cacophonous, and numbing that not even the impressive practical effects can save them. Tawdry sexual humor pervades the entire film; any parent expecting a tame Marvel movie-style PG-13 will be horrified at how sleazy it can get. (Bay's leery camera never met a pair of female buttocks it didn't want to ogle). How can anyone take this seriously as an epic when so much is just relentlessly trashy?The actors don't fare that well, and neither does Megan Fox, who mostly hangs around looking stupid but fulfilling her purpose as a hot chick. Shia LaBeouf probably comes off the best, doing his usual neurotic stuff which can at least be entertaining. Bay tries to do the same thing for John Turturro that he did for Nic Cage in 'The Rock' (turn accomplished character actor into quirky action star) but it's just grating here. Voice actors Peter Cullen and Hugo Weaving are mostly reduced to voice-box quotes.It's frustrating, since unlike the brain-numbing superhero movies of today, there are some scenes and sequences where you realize the potential of the material, only for it to never materialize. The only really good thing about the film is Steve Jablonsky's fantastic soundtrack, which gives a further hint of what might have been.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Expensive, Explosive, Enourmously Rubbish","I got to be part of the first screening in the world showing the final cut and I thought that would be brilliant however I was not expecting to be the first person in the world to witness a highly anticipated failure. This was the general concensus when talking to people after the movie. The start of the movie seemed to show the same elements from the first one such as the comedy within the family which was good however as the film goes on the comedy can almost be described as slap stick. In fact it is the very over used comedy but stopped me from actually being bored by the action ironically.The movie is very long and the explosions were amazing but at one point I wanted them just to sit down and start talking. I felt that the movie became more of an indiana jones movie which ironically they went to the same location as the third Indiana Jones which was probably some Spielberg influence. The performances was good however, their were some awkward Shia performances which you will see when u view the movie. Megan Fox as always was looking amazing, but her character was very much under used and her role became more of a photo shoot with Micheal Bay using camera angles to highlight her beauty which is not that bad but does not make the movie that great. Again I'm trying to justify to you why I thought this blockbuster was such a disappointment.The story felt like it was made up on the spot. As if the writers were winging it and therefore made the whole film feel ridiculous. I felt the story did not have to be so complicated and would have been much better if made simpilar. The dialogue throughout the movie was very hard to hear and this was reinforced by this same statement being said by many of those at the premiere.One man said at the end of the movie that ""thank god it was CGI based movie because otherwise it would have nothing going for it."" I do hope you do see it in the cinema because I do not believe this movie should be seen any other way, but I was surprised that at points of the movie that my eyes glazed over because of how boring some scenes were. At points I could not believe some scenes were happening.Anyway this my opinion let me know what u think of the movie.Anthony",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Tedious Transformers action,"First off, let me start off by saying, I had high expectations for this movie, but sadly i was very disappointed. With a great cast, state of the art special effects and animation, all topped off with a $200 million budget, you'd expect a grandeur summer thrill ride at the cinema.But all you really is get is a tedious, dumb action movie with weak delivery in these key elements- Comic relief, tension, emotion, and set up. throughout the entire movie maybe about 3 out of 30 jokes actually get a laugh out of you. The tension of fearing the death of a character during an action sequence isn't there. The emotion that Mikaela try's to show for Sam isn't believable.Now the biggest complaint. As you can well imagine 2 1/2 hours of Micheal bay's mindless pyrotechnics can get a bit tiresome. Throughout the entire film nothing is set up to intensify fight scene or even switched up a little bit, it's all Shoot and bomb the big a** robots. My advice to Micheal bay, sit down and think before you make a movie. Please!",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Visually Annoying Stupidity,"Three words perfectly describe this film: Visually annoying stupidity. If you want simply a treat for the eyes then you have to settle for glimpses of Megan Fox because the CGI is as bad as the first film. If, like me, you are annoyed by an idiotic plot and tons of nonsensical issues, then stay away from this dud.What happened? This really is a good cast, what should have been interesting characters, but a boring story. I just didn't care what happened to them. The legend generated by the first film has properties that just were missing from the story. Not much action, not enough story. Unfortunately, this sequel joins the dreaded list of disasters.

Krrrraaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr,"Just got back from watching Transformers IMAX style and my head hurts. The film is everything you want from a Michael Bay film:- Tension, gags, attractive women and of course lots and lots of explosions. This film takes all of the aspects that audiences loved and critics hated from the last film and amped it up 7 notches. I found the film really enjoyable with great pacing and a nice mix of humour, simple plot and lots of action. But obviously the reason people go to see this film is for two reasons 1) the explosions and incredible special effects and 2) Megan Fox both in this film are amazing... to look at ahem. I think anyone who goes in with the intention of watching a summer blockbuster will be delighted with how this turned out... Spielberg is said to have told Bay that this is the best film Bay's ever done, obviously Spielberg would say that seeing as he's involved, but I have to agree with him on this one.

Crapformers - Revenge of the Bay,"When Transformers 1 got out in the movies, I was as hyped as any other guy who had played with the big and small robots in the 80s. I had Hot Rod with attachment and almost had the complete Devastator tank before I outgrew the toys. In short, I loved these guys, and the movie was a nice revisit to nostalgia.The first movie had a decent story line, the transformations were moderate and the acting was at times semi corny (I don't blame the actors for that... *looks at Michael Bay*). But it was still entertaining, because you hadn't seen it before, it was a big thing seeing your old hero kick ass as you previously only could imagine it would look like in ""real life"".Now, in what way does Transformers 2 differ? Not in a single way, except a weaker story line. There are no improvements, no proper introductions of the new robots, which simply just appear and starts whipping out dialogs, or more often monologues, that are supposed to be funny, but falls to the ground after the first two.Do you remember back when Optimus would transform into the truck in the cartoons and you'd go ""where the f*** did his trailer come from??"", in this case you'll still be sitting ""what the f*** is going on?"" because Michael bay still does ultra close-ups, uses objects or terrain to cover the transformation, or there is so much going on that you won't see it. In other words, he still skips nice and easy over this part which is probably the coolest thing about both movies. To be honest, that was the biggest thing I was looking forward to in no. 1.There is an upside for you fan-boys though: you'll see an excruciating amount of explosions big and small... just like Bay seems to like it. I guess he has an idea that that compensates bad directing.For my part it was 2½ hours of pain... my girlfriend, who also like the first movie, walked out after 1½ hours. I only stayed to naively get value for money. As soon as the texts started rolling I was out of there, I didn't bother staying for any post-images that would only toss more shameful humor at me....Oh... if you're thinking that a digital presentation and THX sound is going to make this an experience, just like I did... you're wrong.

Dramamine and Earplugs,"Dramamine and earplugs.I was in the Imax theater to watch Star Trek less than 2 months ago, and I spent the 1st 5 minutes of the actual movie hoping the ringing in my ears would go away. The tinnitus was caused by less than 3 minutes' exposure to the trailer for the Transformers sequel. At least it was fair warning. I made it a point to see the actual film in a regular theater and avoided Imax's 12,000 watts of sound. As a result, I am not totally deaf, tho not for Michael Bay's lack of trying.No shot in the film runs as long as 5 seconds, and the camera never stops moving. You think I'm exaggerating, don't you?There are some giant robots who want to destroy the Sun and other giant robots who want to protect the Earth. Except for one old-fart giant robot who just wants everyone to get off his lawn, it's close to impossible to tell them apart. They spend a lot of time duking it out with giant whirly hunks of metal and lots of flashing, smashing, and of course transforming. Everything goes by in a blur, which I have to presume was intentional. Little humans run in and out of the carnage, and I guess we're supposed to care.Based on product-placement fees and quantity of gratuitously destroyed vehicles, I strongly suspect I've figured out why General Motors went bankrupt.Every now and again the movie slows down just a tad and people stop shouting over the din enuf that you can actually understand what they're saying, and they get off a couple of clever lines, enuf to save this calamity from my lowest possible rating.Dramamine and earplugs.

Nowhere near as good as the first,"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen unfortunately doubles down on all the minor issues from its predecessor that have now become major problems. The plot is absolutely nonsensical, the run time has increased when it should've gotten shorter and it can be uncomfortable to watch at times thanks to the racism and sexism. What saves this is the grade A action in the first and third act so even when it goes off the rails it's still a bombastic blast.Shia LaBeouf has only gotten more manic. Whilst it's nice to see Sam Witwicky grow with each film his performance in this one devolves into deranged ramblings and shouting for a large portion. Megan Fox annoyingly has less agency as her character is almost entirely defined by her relationship to Sam this time. Bringing back John Turturro and letting him go on the majority of the adventure helps to keep this going in the middle.Peter Cullen will never be anything less than faultless even as this rendition of Optimus Prime becomes a psychopath. Every line he's given is imbued with all the necessary world weariness and emotion, he's just frustratingly sidelined this time. On the opposite end, by coming into the film a lot earlier Hugo Weaving gets a lot more to work with as Megatron, including an actually faithful dynamic with Charlie Adler's suitably cowardly Starscream.Even if some of his creative choices aren't the best, director Michael Bay's technical craft never falters, resulting in the most technically accomplished blockbuster to come out of a writer's strike. The robot on robot fights reach an all time high with the 3 vs 1 forest fight in the middle and even though there's weirdly no major set piece until the third act afterwards, the Bayhem unleashed at the end is reliably top tier stuff, culminating in a former record setting explosion.The other major aspect not to falter is the spectacular CGI. The Decepticon designs reuse a lot of assets which is understandable considering the time crunch. Steve Jablonsky's score doesn't create anything as awe inspiring as last time but it remains a noticeable presence that can always deliver what's needed of it. Plus Linkin Park's New Divide definitely picks up any slack left by the score since it's just an unapologetically epic end credits song.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Huh?,"What a piece of junk. Seriously I wouldn't mind the ridiculous plot, silly dialog, childish characters, etc if it wasn't mixed in with extreme violence, sexual innuendo, and all the other inappropriate for kid stuff thrown into the mix. Who is this movie made for? If it is for kids then Bay needs to be checked. No parent with a brain would let their kid sit through this. If it is for adults then holy cow they didn't offer up anything. As far as I can figure the writers and Bay put this together for males 18-25 who sit around in their basement in underwear playing with action figures. If that is the case then mission accomplished. It really is a giant piece of rubbish. My whole problem with this is man it could be amazing. Either for kids or adults. Just pick a direction and stay focused on it. You don't have to be perfect although shooting for that would be nice. But if you want to make an amazing Transformers then pick an audience and give that audience the best movie because what you are doing now is turning every crowd off. My kid loves Transformers toys (I never did as a kid) which is why we got excited about the first movie. But he found it boring except for parts and as an adult I found it even more so.

Since the main characters are already familiar with the Autobots and we know how everything works, there's almost none of that epic surprise moment. Where the first one scored points, it doesn't do so well here. What makes this film good is the action, which is still plenty and still awesome, even if it still remains far behind the finale from the previous installment. Besides, there is less of it here as the film slows down the pace. From a certain point on, it became quite uninteresting for me and downright drawn out towards the end. The plot is quite weak.

What you will experience instead are the following; Giant robot testicles, John Turturro's scrotum and buttocks, two dogs humping nonstop, robots humping humans, non-stop close-ups of Megan Fox's clothed private parts, a giant robot penis, endless amounts of sex jokes in general, robot heaven, robot black racist stereotypes, conspiracy theorist stereotypes, a mentally handicapped college professor compare himself to god, a woman going crazy from exposure to marijuana, two second transportation across the world over and over, a girl speed racing to Washington from LA, a guy not caring that a robot has saved his life constantly, characters getting killed and then magically being alive again, obnoxious and annoying subplots involving human characters that we couldn't possibly even begin to care about, pretentious and shameless Michael Bay advertisements for his other work, lots of falling wheels, lots of falling cars, lots of falling cogs, lots of falling bolts, lots of falling pieces of random scrap metal that breaks apart far too easily, lots of people not caring that giant robots are fighting in the middle of the city, lots of really bad dialogue, lots of confusing gray colored robots with no discernible features, endless amounts of plot holes, endless amounts of scenes of characters pointing out plot holes and then being shut up, and NO PLOT. There is nothing here. Not even the fight scenes manage to satisfy. It's all just a lot of endless noise and machinery flying all over the place for no reason! Occasionally you'll get a lackluster view of robots holding onto each other and shoving each other and that's it! I actually enjoyed the first film, mind you. It wasn't good or anything, but it was entertaining. TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN is just junk, plain and simple. There is, literally, nothing. There's no reason to care, no reason to watch, and no reason to waste money on it. It is just junk. That's the best way I can describe it. Junk. I'm so glad I saw this for free because if I had paid to see this I probably would never go see a Michael Bay film ever again.By the way, I've noticed that this comment has gotten reported and taken down three times now by snooty fanboys. That just goes to show you the crass mentality of some of the fans of this film.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Needed more of Optimus Prime,"The film has all the glitz and glamour; this sequel has some celebrated action and transformation sequences, but the writing of it suffers drastically. There are evidences of struggle throughout the narrative, from its central plot to its characters as well as each of their motives and actions.I truly feel that this movie needed more Optimus Prime because he is and always has been the uncontested show-stealer. The entire arc of him being resurrected by the mystical power of the Matrix appeared to be fairly ambitious, but Prime's notable absence in the middle brought more harm than good in my humble opinion.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Any potential for a classic sequel is destroyed forever,"I saw Transformers 2 Revenge Of The Fallen last night. I had been looking forward to seeing it for months. Well, this is a car crash of a movie sequel, i mean even though i enjoyed the first one very much, i was still disappointed how different Optimus Prime, Megatron, Jazz, Bumblebee and Starscream all looked in the final movie compared to their appearances in the Genration 1 comic books. But my disappointment got bigger and bigger until i left the cinema consumed with a hatred for the makers of this vile garbage that i could barely contain.To begin with, it starts with another gigantic, confusing battle in China (i think) there was so much happening in these scenes that it confounded my mind into a bloody headache. Optimus Prime and the autobots have teamed up with the platoon of soldiers from the first movie to go hunting down Decepticons around the Earth, so far so ho hum. The problem with this scene is that i couldn't tell who was autobot and who was decepticon because of the way the Transformers motion around on the big screen during the action scenes, this was a problem i had with the original as well.The narrative and the storyline were all over the place. I couldn't help thinking that the cast were hurrying through their scenes as if they were desperate to be somewhere else. Shia la Beouf is one of the worst actors ever to become a film star. Hes like a human version of Jar Jar Binks from Phantom Menace, honestly i wanted him to die horribly.Megan Fox kept me going though, but lets face it, she knows why shes in this film and its not because we all think she has the same range as Jodie Foster and Meryl Streep combined, its because shes fantastic looking straddled out over a Harley Davidson thats why. Thank God for that scene alone.The 'comedy' scenes stamped any potential this sequel had into the ground. What did the screenwriters think was so funny about Shia's mother running around his Campus high on Drugs? The dogs having sex on the couch didn't help either. Talk about shooting yourself in the foot.I honestly thought this would be a great follow up to the first movie the way Superman 2 or even Terminator 2 was to their originals, but boy i was wrong...absolutely terrible.Cal.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
i've watched it 2 times now.,"As expected, low scores.. i dont know what critics are looking for in the movie, but whatever. Its their opinion. I thought it was really entertaining, engaging thruout the movie. And some reviewers dissed the slang-speaking autobots, wtf! This movie is meant to be funny+actionpacked, thats why they put it there! Dont listen to the critics, watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Sequel with Bigger and Better Action,"""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" is a sequel to the 2007 blockbuster hit ""Transformers"". The movie is directed by Michael Bay and stars Shia LaBeouf, Megan Fox, and Josh Duhamel. The story continues where the first movie left off, with the Autobots and the Decepticons fighting for control of Earth.The movie is packed with action from start to finish, and the effects are even more impressive than in the first installment. The fight scenes are bigger, the explosions are louder, and the CGI robots are more detailed.The performances of the actors are also commendable, especially Shia LaBeouf who plays Sam Witwicky. His character goes through a lot of emotional turmoil in the movie, and LaBeouf delivers a convincing performance.The plot of the movie is not as strong as the first one, but it still manages to keep the audience engaged. The humor in the movie is also a welcome addition, and it provides a nice break from all the action.Overall, ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" is a worthy sequel to the first movie. It may not be as good as the original, but it still delivers on its promise of high-octane action and stunning visual effects. If you are a fan of the first movie, then you will definitely enjoy this one too.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Exactly What We Want Out of a Transformers Film,"The first Transformers amazed viewers with its fabulous special effects, so much so that it left us (including myself) begging for more epic fight scenes between giant robots from a different planet. Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen brings us just that...and only that. A lack of a central plot and some slightly poor script writing dampens Transformers. Despite this, director Michael Bay has indeed given what we have longed for. Amazing special effects. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a good film, not a great one like the previous movie, but a good one. After all, the only reason why we watch Transformers is for the action scenes. And there is plenty for everybody in Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. 7/10",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Transformers. Revenge of the Fallen: Don't Need This,"Money is dripping and fans are demanding more. What else do you need to create a new film? Right! More money in the ""budget"" column, more robots and more stupidity, which, by the way, prevails over sanity here. Transformers, whose popularity has increased every day since the release of the picture in 2007, a great future awaited. Talented actors, talented director - all this was part of the original film, which thanks to these things has become successful. Foreshadowing the sequel, everyone expected that it would turn out no worse than then. But, unfortunately, the sequel syndrome, which is popular to this day, successfully manifested itself in 2009, when creating this picture.The first thing I want to note is the problem with the development of robots. Started in the first film, the ""bzik"" continued its journey in the sequel. Unsuccessful attempts to develop chemistry between Sam and Bumblebee lead to children's fairy tales, in which the essence is the same - someday mutual love must begin between the characters. Sam and Bumblebee have it, but it is shown so clumsily that the love line between Michaela and Sam looks much better, and it is practically absent in the film. So draw your own conclusions. Newcomers among the Autobots, recently arrived at the behest of Optimus Prime, the Skids and Wheelie twins should have brought more humor to the picture. With their arrival, it was possible, but it turned out to be too hackneyed. Not much is known about the twins themselves, other than that they love to ""pin"" each other at the most inopportune moment. Ironhide, famous for disliking the human race because of excessive cruelty, is still a big man with hefty guns. Bumblebee's guardian has been transformed from a warrior into a postman who rushes around at every signal from Prime or Whitwicky.The second thing that needs a major overhaul is a love and friendship line. Sam, having clearly shown himself in the battle with Megatron, won the heart of the beauty Michaela. If in the first picture Sam was thinking about how to introduce himself to a girl in order to please, and not scare away, then in the second part he shows himself as a slob who is afraid to say ""I love you"". From the stormy relationship, which amazed themselves with their actions, dramatic lyrics turned out. Megan Fox, the sex symbol of the tape, from a naive schoolgirl turns into a mature girl who really has found a brain. She shows charisma, proving to Sam that she is worth something and now her character represents a more important person than the one that was in the first part. The acting looks decent, even against the background of the drama. Sam, after graduating from school, began to study at the university. Realizing what student life is, Sam quickly finds friends. Leo is an Internet entrepreneur with his own view of the world and a business plan for the future. In general, Leo is another comical character who came to the franchise to dilute the lackluster situation. His personality is cheerful, the character is casual, and his actions are cowardly. One of the reasons why you want to watch a picture.The Decepticons are still not wanted to be the main faces of the franchise, and this is really terrible news. Follen, a member of an earlier Transformer race, wishes to rid the living worlds of the sun. Follen, whose desire prevails over realization, is no different from the previous film's version of Megatron. Weak motives backed by a desire to kill Optimus Prime - stupid, isn't it? Megatron, the powerful ruler of the Decepticons, is depicted as a dull journeyman who has a clear goal - to serve Follen. The once great transformer has turned into a messenger. Pleases only Starscream, whose hypocrisy is the main weapon of the transformer. He still pretends that Megatron is his master, and he wants to serve him. But in reality, Starscream is still the same hypocrite, ready to frame the leader to take his place.Do not be upset if you are going to do this after reading the first three points. ""Revenge of the Fallen"" boasts colorful battles between Autobots and Decepticons. Popular to this day, the battle of Optimus and the Decepticons in the forest, the result of which turned out to be tragic, no longer amazes with the quality of the shooting, but with the emotions. Optimus' desire is not an empty phrase. He wants to protect not only Sam, but all of humanity. He understands that if he loses this war, then the end will come not only to the Autobots. Losing means death. The final battle in the Egyptian Desert differs from Mission City in that the location has a one-sided tone. Bright, warm Egypt replaced the various lanes of cities, which did not really benefit the picture. The scenes, although they look exciting, but the monotony quickly gets bored.Verdict. Revenge of the Fallen is definitely not the best picture in the entire franchise. Weak attempts to create a worthy sequel led to a fiasco. The already not the best plot became even worse, attributing to itself in the category of ""terrible"" new characters that they did not bother to reveal. The game of some actors (Duhamel, Turturro) allowed the film to stay afloat, thanks to which the picture could not sink to the very bottom. From all this tape, the good news is that this is at least not the worst film in the series. As the saying goes: ""And thanks for that!"".Remember me boy?Happy viewing!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This is a fun addition to the action genre that's a step down in storyline from the first film,"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009) is a movie that I recently watched with my daughter on Amazon Prime. The storyline picks up where the last film left off but now Sam is off to college and Mikelea is home helping her dad run the family business. As they balance a long distance relationship an artifact remains from the first film that energizes the Decepticons and gives them hope they can bring back Megatron. Can the Transformers, Sam, Mekeala and some old friends stop the Decepticons again?This movie is directed by Michael Bay (The Rock) and stars Shia LaBeouf (Fury), Megan Fox (Jennifer's Body), Josh Duhamel (Turistas), Tyrese Gibson (Baby Boy), John Turturro (The Big Lebowski) and Kevin Dunn (Warrior).The sound and special effects that made the first film so great was consistent and carried over well to this picture. They also did a great job of bringing back the original cast moreso than they did utilizing them. The writing was even cheesier than the first film and the use of the characters at times felt forced. I will say I liked the addition of the twin characters and there are some tremendous action scenes in. There's a woods sequence that's tremendous and as good as any action sequence in the series.Overall, this is a fun addition to the action genre that's a step down in storyline from the first film. I would score this a 6.5-7/10 and strongly recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Good in its own right, but not better than the original.","As with any sequel, it is expected to be bigger and better than the first film. 'Transformers 2' offers much more on action and CGI. Although it was maybe a bit too CGI-heavy, it goes with the territory considering the nature of the film, and was still thrilling to watch.The impressive action-packed opening sequence set the standard for what was to come. Once again, the visuals are incredible. The story continues as the Decepticons learn of a shard of the Allspark Cube remaining still, and they'll do anything to get it. Naturally, chaos and mayhem follow as the Decepticons destroys much of the cities around the world. And boy, Michael Bay does enjoy destroying things!!Most of the original cast is back to reprise there roles, which I enjoyed. It was not as suspenseful as the original, as this film has a lot more humor. The Transformer twins were just stupid as the comic relief characters and it would have been so much better without them. The library scene was really great, and the desert attack scene in Egypt was simply awesome! The action is insane! I must be honest, though, I enjoyed the first film much more.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A step above the first one,"That's not saying much mind you. In the original movie the transformers were treated like punching bags and punchlines. No real interaction with the story or other characters at all. This movie, in that respect, is slightly better, but while, in a few scenes, where the transformers are treated like actual characters, this movie also does some really dumb things.The most glaring example of this added stupidity are the 4chan brothers; twin Autobots that do nothing but talk smack throughout the entire movie. The one scene where they aren't talking smack is so ridiculous, that its not even worth mentioning.A couple of less impressive moments include a paper-thin Decepticon that somehow manages to hold onto and hide a large chunk of the cube from the first movie, a female Decepticon that transforms into a human female with a three foot prehensile tongue (the tip of which remains as a tongue even when she is in robot form, because the audience is not expected to know what the long appendage reaching from her mouth is referring to), and a tiny Decepticon whose most treacherous act is to hump Megan Fox's leg for far too long. Bumblebee's stupidity was seen in the trailer so it should come as no surprise when he starts bawling like a 3 year old that doesn't get its way.Also the plot includes finding this key which five Autobot ""Primes"" died to protect by merely burying it in a pile of rocks and turning their bodies into the shrine which housed it. This ""sacrifice"" makes absolutely no sense except that Michael Bay needed, for the sake of the final fight, all the other Primes to die so that only Optimus Prime would be left to kill off the Fallen, which only a Prime can kill - its never explained why nothing else can kill this robot. Maybe its like the 4th directive from Robocop, I don't know. This is not a movie you can put a lot of thought into.There are a couple of good things in this film. Soundwave makes regular appearances as a communications satellite and is never found out during the length of the film - which is surprisingly good writing. Also, Shia Lebouf is far less irritating in this film than he was in the first one, which is a major plus.All in all, not bad. I was honestly expecting it to be much worse.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not much development and differences that rise significantly,"Sam Witwicky has left the Autobots to start his new life. However, he found himself able to see a vague symbol that referred to an ancient entity that was the source of a weapon. Sam was forced to return in the Transformers war.Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is thesecond f ilm continuing the machinations of the problem between the Autobots and the Decepticons. Revenge of the Fallen presents a revenge story from a Fallen who is the teacher and the person behind Megatron and the Decepticon attacks on earth. I guess this gets interesting by fighting much stronger enemies. It turned out to be the same. The dashing heroic action of Optimus Prime became unexciting. This can be seen from how easy it is to solve the Optimus Prime and Fallen battle. Simple and stunning, but not fun and fun enough. Seeing the change of form from Optimus Prime like Power Rangers is funny and weird. A completion and became the end point of a sucking movie. Revenge of the Fallen has a plot that is not bad but also not entirely satisfactory. Too many stories, dramas, and conversations are widespread and long-winded. It's a pity that it's far from expectations. We are not given too much room to see how Energon works as well as the function of the existence of the Matrix itself. It can be seen in this film that many of the pieces are hidden or not shown so that it shows a half-storyline.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Michael Bay is fantastic!,"My headline is exactly what you feel after watching the mega-budget 'Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen'.Michael Bay has made epics, including the 2007 Super-hit 'Transformers'... this being its sequel doesn't live up-to its previous part. 'Transformers' was an amazing experience, with almost everything going with it. That film was a winner, but the sequel, for which people rushed into the cineplexes and making this a Blockbuster, isn't really that great.The problem: The script lacks fire, it's paper thin and gets dragging towards the end. As they say, first impression is last impression, the first made people to wow all the way, but the second lacks the fizz. The film doesn't hold in most parts, apart from the climax, there is hardly anything that makes you go Holy Cow!!!A special mention for: Bay's brilliant direction, one wished he would've come up with a stronger screenplay. Performances by Shia and Megan are top notch. Shia is fantastic. The Graphics are as fascinating as the first.Minuses: Script doesn't hold.To sum up, 'Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen' had the potential to make you go wow! But sadly, that doesn't happen here!",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What were they thinking,"I was looking forward what turned out to be one of the worst movie-going experiences of the year, I'm pretty sure its still gonna top the box office which sucks because that means Michael Bay will do a 3rd Transformers thus completely ruining the first one. I would gladly go back in time and see it on DVD later because then I would've had an option of stopping this torture of bad script and jokes which was just painful to watch (even Turturro seemed boring on screen after watching T2 for about hour and a half, probably a first for him) . The design of Autobots is still pretty amazing tho, and thats about the only good thing there was about it. The plot seemed very ordinary for the much awaited sequel, and instead of a couple big, charged battles there seemed to be about ten of them which took the wind out of the last time. I can't imagine willingly seeing this movie again.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pretty bad..,"I feel like I got tricked again. I really didn't care for the first Transformers movie much, but I assumed, like most people, Michael Bay uses criticism to improve and move on to the next project and do it better with this new found knowledge. But, with Transformers 2 some was improved, but a lot was just plain bad. The first hour was painful.. Terrible dialogue, many many innuendos, a set of twin Autobots that were equally annoying as Jar Jar Binks from Star Wars, awkward plot movement, and just plain bad writing. The first hour felt like it was written by a 40 something who is completely out of touch with the audience they are trying to reach, trying to write a story that will touch that age group with dialogue that will be relevant to them.. and it failed very badly. And please, do not take any children to this movie. It is given a PG-13 rating, but I wonder about that. Not only do you get see a robot that has testicles, but also you get to hear many profanities used by robots for seemingly no good reason other than they are supposed to sound ghetto. Also sex is eluded to with Megan Fox in pretty much every scene she is in. This seems to be her only function in this movie.The last hour and a half wasn't so bad. I started to notice a difference around the time the main characters go to meet John Turturros character. From there on, the story gets pretty good, the action is non stop, and the Autobots get some pretty cool gear.Overall I give it a 50%. Don't pay to see it. Wait for a friend to get it on DVD, and even then it still may not be worth your two and a half hours that you could be doing something else.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Sadly disappointed,"Considering previous Michael Bay productions I was not expecting too much from the first film but was pleasantly surprised by its visual intoxication, with characters carefully charted throughout the film. Unfortunately Revenge of the Fallen's chemistry was severely unbalanced. The much adored battle scenes from the first movie were sadly not outdone for this sequel, instead they were just longer, louder and without creativity. I would not totally discredited this film as Shia la Boeuf's performance was yet again commendable. You could see the director was pushed for time as most of the battle scenes were shot in slow motion to add the more dramatic effect but after 9 or 10 of them it can get a bit tedious then eventually funny when it shouldn't be. But in respect I wasn't constantly watching the clock waiting for it to end, so I was entertained enough to sit through the length of this picture. But as a person who truly rates films on the premise that I could watch them over and over again, sadly this is not one of them.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Certainly not better than the first but it's an awesome sequel!,"Why all the negativity? Revenge of the Fallen was everything you look for in a summer action blockbuster. Sure, it did have some plot holes and some annoying new characters but overall, it's a must-see for any Transformers-fan like myself. The effects and fight scenes, especially the big battle in Egypt, are all very spectacular. Coming from Michael Bay, that's saying a lot to me. I never thought he could pull off a sequel that would be as good as the originals. Although I still adore the first movie, this is an excellent entry into the series. Should Bay make a third film in the franchise, then count me in. Cannot wait to see the Autobots kick more a**.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"FUN , awesome effects","First off I have to say that the effects in this movie were off the charts. An unbelievable amount of work went into all of that and you have to appreciate it. The movie itself was a lot more action packed than the first and although it was not a master work of art, it was pretty cool. This movie was more tacky than the first, but it also had better action scene's, a better plot and was a lot more intense than the first. To be honest I found the first a little boring but back to revenge of the fallen. If you like action, hot women and science fiction, this film is a must see.Overall 9 out of ten, because it could have been more epic/ well thought out.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Transformers Revenge Of The Fallen Decent But With Many  Flaws,"Transformers Revenge Of The Fallen is decent but the film suffers from an overlong running time, a rushed finale, abrupt ending, and the lack of character development especially the Autobots and Decepticons. The dialogue wasn't the greatest at times and some of the humor didn't work either. Director Michael Bay is an okay director but this isn't his best film because there's more of everything (robots, action, special effects and humor) in this one but it ended up hurting this sequel instead of making it better. Shia Labeouf reprises the role of Sam providing his usual comic relief and he's decent as the character. Megan Fox is all right as Mikaela but she isn't given much to do except to be eye candy. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson are back too but even they seem to have less to do in this one. John Turturo is also back and he does a good job as Simmons . The special effects are top notch but it sort of becomes overkill after a while and the robot action/fight sequences are well executed for the most part. The only fight though that had any emotional to it was between Optimus and three Decepticons in a fierce forest showdown that leaves the Aubobots leader ready for the scrap yard because after that battle the action/fight sequences kind of become repetitive. This sequel definitely seemed to be more about the action and special effects than the story and characters. The biggest flaw this movie has is the treatment of not only the new autobots and decepticons but the returning ones as well because most of them with the exceptional of maybe Optimus, Bumblebee and Megatron don't get nearly enough screen time. Many of the new Decepticons introduced (like The Fallen, Devastator, Soundwave, Grindor, Sideways, and Demolisher among many others) only show up for a few minutes before either being killed or disappearing with no explanation. Except for Megatron, The Fallen, and Starscream the others have little to no dialogue who serve no real purpose besides one maybe two action/fight sequences. Some of the new Autbots including Arcee, Jolt, and Sideswipe aren't even given the proper treatment they deserve because none of them are in it long enough to leave an impression. Returning ones like Ironhide and Ratchet are MIA for the most of the movie. They both make a few appearances with little to no dialogue. They're not in it nearly as much as the first one. Even fan favorites like Optimus Prime and Bumblebee are MIA for large parts of the film but they're effective in their limited screen time. Megatron and Starscream get a little more to do than the first one by not by much. The two characters I was most disappointed in were The Fallen and Devastator. They both get at the most 5 to 8 minutes of screen time. The Fallen is an interesting character but he's killed off in his fight near the end by Optimus way too easily to be that much of a threat and he could've been a much more worthy adversary (His fight with Optimus lasts 8 to 10 seconds if that). The character Devastator had promise and looked like cool but the joke with the wrecking balls for his well you know I didn't find that funny. Devastator doesn't even show up until near the end and is easily defeated like The Fallen. Scorpnok makes a blink and you missed it cameo in the desert climax before being killed off five seconds later making the characters appearance rather pointless. There were simply too many robots on both sides. If they focused on the returning one mores and gave them more screen time while introducing some new robots it would've been better because some character development is better than none. The only two characters to get any sort of development were Jetfire and the Twins. I didn't find the Twins racist like some people did but the movie could've easily done without them giving more screen time to Optimus, Bumblebee, Ironhide, Ratchet, or some of the other characters. Jetfire was another interesting character but I don't know why they had him speak with an accent. The abrupt ending left you wondering about what happened to many of the characters like Megatron and Starscream to name a few. There was also a part late into the film where Sam gets hurt and then a second later his hand is bandaged up so this seemed like an error from the screenwriters for not coming up with a better way to put Labeouf's real life injury into the story. For those of you who have seen it already you probably know what scene I'm talking about. The ending does leaves the door open for another possible sequel but I just hope if they do make a third film it's better than this one. The music also didn't really seem to sync well with the movie like it did with the first one and the raunchy humor was often funny while others no so much. The running time of 2 and half hours did make the movie feel a little long especially toward the end. Overall despite it's many flaws Trasformers Revenge Of The Fallen is a decent sci-fi adventure with plenty of robot action, some humor, and good performances by the cast but this sequel could've been a lot better.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Painful and Insulting,"The usual defense in this situation is, ""if you were looking for deep plot and Oscar-worthy acting, then of course you were going to be disappointed."" But this is not a valid excuse for the travesty that was Transformers 2. Just because a movie is based off of a cartoon which is based off of a toy, this doesn't mean that the director doesn't have to construct a good plot. Is it terrible to ask that a movie with a $150 million budget have a decent plot line? But a decent plot line there was not. There was something about a key, and a machine to blow up the sun, but the rest of the plot was so haphazardly thrown together that it seemed to have fallen last on the list of Michael Bay's priorities in this film. Priority one was, it seemed, to blow up as much as humanly possible. Some people can endure 2 1/2 hours of explosions, others cannot.The acting is not only sub-par, it's lazy. It's as if all the actors in the film knew they were only second to the super-cool robots, and so they PLAYED second to the super-cool robots. Shia and Megan's romance was hard to care about, because there was no chemistry, and it was very annoying to see Megan Fox's character embody the ""love-obsessed-girlfriend"" stereotype. The world is about to blown up and all she can care about is the fact that her boyfriend hasn't said the ""l"" word yet? Please. At that point, no one cared. In fact, no one really cared about much in this movie except the fights, and it doesn't matter that it's an action movie or not. People still need to care about what they're seeing, it doesn't matter whether it's a movie about the Holocaust, or a movie about a toy.

Transformers 2 review,Once again I found myself going into another movie not knowing what to expect. I never really did care much about transformers in general but after seeing the first movie i thought to myself wow so that was transformers huh not bad. so when the news came about announcing the 2nd movie i just thought what more could they do? answer more action more explosions more Megan fox and another story i didn't care much about the film's highlights obviously were the extended over the top action scenes. watching those robots really duke it out on the big screen really makes you feel like you're right in the action and man are there a handful of those scenes. At first I just thought wow this movie basically was just one action scene after another. The story however is just straightforward and linear to say the least. Now I'm not gonna spoil anything I mean this is just a review if you wanna know the story read the summary or go watch the movie. overall it's just another summer blockbuster with pure entertainmentPROS --kickass action scenes --great effectsCONS --straightforward linear storyline --sub-par acting,7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Biggest Disappointment,"Transformers 2 is OK at best but fails to live up to expectations after seeing the fantastic first one. The effects are great as well as the fight scenes but other than that it's really nothing special. It failed to get me excited at all, didn't have the ""wow"" factor so to speak. The movie was really dull, as much as I wanted to get into it I simply couldn't. They really overused Megan Fox in this movie as well, went completely out of their way to show her hotness. I love Megan Fox and all but even when she was ripping off her clothes at one point and hearing the men in the theater all yelling ""wooooo!""

Just might be the worst film in the history of cinema,"For all intents and purposes, there is no story within this film. It is an utter, and complete mess, an abominable and failed film-making exercise in all CGI and no character advancement.It is a cocktail of explosions and over-use of CGI, and eon-old Hollywood clichés stolen from a collection of classics. Michael Bay has obviously forgotten his adequate storytelling since ""The Island"" and is now treading where horrible sequels tread... the land of all style, no substance.Aside from plot holes, loop holes, and gaping crater holes spread throughout the film it is terribly edited. There are time-lapses, and untimely scene cuts, and inexplicable displacement of characters and robots all the time. It is as if Michael Bay decided to edit it on his own (which he has), and gave up when he realized what a churning, improvisational mess he had shot on set.The acting is competent from all leads, aside from the mediocrity of Megan Fox, which has to be singled out. She is nothing more in this film than a vessel for cleavage, a tanned face with blue eyes. I don't know which one is sadder; Michael Bay's objectification of this girl, or her acceptance of it. Her romantic scenes with Shia LeBeouf feels like torture, force-fed and with less authenticity than the most tear jerking sequence in ""Pearl Harbor"".Of course it all comes down to the material, since the script is an utter insult to those tireless people who toil and write everyday in the film industry. It is truly a marvelous piece of juvenile humor, chaotic action scenes and Michael Bay's genital fixation and toilet humor with robots.All the characters are tanned from the 80s, all the girls are hot, all the men are wise cracking clowns and all the robots have stereotypical accents of either black or English men.If you do one thing right in your life, do not see this film.This is the zenith in the history of bad movies.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good Film! Expected More Though.,"I went and watched this today and i liked it, but felt it was just more of the same which don't get me wrong isn't bad just the same. There were more transformers which I wanted but not many Autobots just decepticons with no back stories or names and this really disappointed me. There were a lot more fights in this film compared to the first one which again was good but since the first one i felt the scenes could of shown more of the autobots and stop keep going back to the humans. I know I'm not a director but i think the fight scenes could have been more from a far so your able to see whats going on a little better. Other than the few faults i pointed out, i felt this was a really good film would of got an 8 if it was different from the first one. But I gave it a 7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Huge step down from the first film,"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a blockbuster of the most egregious variety. As a stand-alone film, it's noisy, vapid and bloated. As a sequel to the first film — which was, as you might recall, a surprisingly entertaining popcorn flick — it's disappointing and borderline offensive. It's the sort of sequel that was all too common in the 1980s — a continuation of a story without a story; about as necessary as Weekend at Bernie's II or whatever other marginally tolerable cash-in you can think of. The movie was clearly built from its predecessor's success, with little consideration given to the dynamics of what's actually occurring on-screen. For some people, this may seem a minor complaint — after all, as its stars willingly admitted in junket interviews, people don't go to see films about giant fighting robots for the story lines — but at nearly two-and-a-half hours, you're likely to find your patience put to its test, especially when you can't even wrap your head around what's happening half the time.The actors are all given thankless tasks to perform. Shia LaBeouf is one of the most likable and convincing actors of his kind — perhaps not the sort of deeply committed artist you'd rank as a great actor, but amiable and charming enough to carry blockbusters. His performance in the first Transformers helped add human conflict to an otherwise robotic (pun intended) string of action sequences. Here, he's given quite little to do. Why's he even in the story at all? It's never fully explained, beyond the obvious (um, he has to be, because you don't fix what ain't broke, right?). The plot: He finds a piece of shrapnel left behind from the first film and has a bunch of alien data magically ingrained into his brain on the day he leaves for Princeton University; suddenly the Decepticons are after him, to extract the information that will apparently lead them to the location (in an Egyptian desert) of a device that can, like, blow up the sun or something.None of it really makes sense. Most of the characters from the first film return (bar Jon Voight), and the roles seem pointless. Megan Fox, god bless her, tries to do more than just pout for the camera, but she appears and disappears at the will of the screenplay, which disregards her altogether for half the movie. She is, of course, a bad actress; but she openly acknowledges this, which makes me respect her far more than I otherwise would. I want to see her do well based solely on the fact that she's not the typical politically correct, wholesome Hollywood starlet. Brutally honest, self-deprecating beauties don't come around very often. To witness her fighting against the underdeveloped typecasting of her character is a struggle. To watch her openly describe Michael Bay as a ""tyrant"" to his face during a press conference is delightful; I'd more gladly pay for 2 1/2 hours of that.Most action films have one form of comedic relief; Transformers 2 has four. John Turturro returns to his role as an obsessive and wacky CIA agent (he provides the most laughs, which are hardly plentiful), but there's also three regrettable new sidekicks: a pair of unintentionally racist gangsta Transformers (perhaps the most offensive animated ethnic stereotypes since Jar-Jar Binks), and a perpetually whiny college kid played by newcomer Ramon Rodriguez, who has promised us that his role in Transformers 3 will be greatly expanded. No, thanks.Then, at least, there's director Michael Bay. What on earth inspired him to create such a laborious, boring film? Perhaps the same level of vanity that propelled him to feature close-ups of a poster for Bad Boys II here? Another filmmaker — Steven Spielberg, for example — might be able to get away with this sort of apparent self-love on the belief that he's being tongue-in-cheek. We never quite get that feeling with Bay. When he shows us the Bad Boys poster, it's self-idolatry — not self-deprecation or even just self-reference. And it's that ego of his, I'd imagine, that caused him to make his worst film since Pearl Harbor — and that one's really only worse because of its blatant disregard for the historical aspects. If Transformers: RotF were based on a true series of events, I'd be inclined to say this is even worse, because it felt even longer than Pearl Harbor, which is no easy feat.The saddest part about this whole mess is that you realize countless hours were invested in its technical craft. The special effects are superb; animators gave healthy portions of their lives to making this thing look good, and then when you see it up on screen, it's all so barely decipherable; between the shaky camera, split-second cuts and constant panning, the intertwining robots are virtually impossible to get a handle on. Who's beating whom? I couldn't even tell half the time. The last 45 minutes of the movie are so painful, dull and monotonous that I just kept checking my wristwatch in anguish, trying to calculate when the film had actually started and how long the previews had lasted. I saw The Dark Knight a year ago — a film of comparable length — and don't recall glancing away from the screen a single time, much less to check the time. The era of superior action thrillers has only rendered Michael Bay's inadequacies all the more obvious; it's clearer now than ever before that this guy really doesn't have a clue what he's doing. There are elements of his style that I admire, and certainly no one can claim he isn't distinct — the problem is that he's currently distinctly awful, and cutting his running times down by about an hour and learning how to handle his actors (I haven't yet mentioned his complete misuse of Rainn Wilson) might be a step in the right direction.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

not that bad,"i think this film is better than the first. we get to see more action, and this film is not entirely devoid of character development. pros: more emotion from mikaela who shouts that she loves Sam. also, i like the autobot twins, wheelie and jetfire, and Leo and Simmons are a welcome distraction. cons: really confusing. Sam suddenly became an intellectual, and many things were not explained. the robot girl was disgusting. and utensils randomly turning into robots are weird. sam's mom is weird, behaving like a loony, and his dad is very calm at first but turns emotional later on. overall, this movie is quite exciting, but, like candy, it does not last.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Michael Bay's Revenge,"If you followed the first transformer then you know a lot of critics gave Bay a hard time for making a movie that was heavy on action and thin on plot. well it look like this time around Michael Bay decide to prove them wrong, by taking everything they complained about and making it bigger...Big mistake on his part and we suffer for it. The stuff most critic complained about was true and if Bay had humbled himself he would have gotten rave review from everyone including the critics. If he had even listen to half of what was said about the film, this movie would have probably won awards during the Oscar seasons. But no, bay is all ego and he made is ego ruin a great franchise...The first movie was all eye candy. from the girls, to the cars, etc. but this movie was just long and boring. The movies started out decent but for some odd reason that i cannot put my fingers on, i didn't enjoy the film....I was bored to the point I fell asleep within the first hour, because nothing interesting really happened in the movie...don't get me wrong, there was action happening all the time, but there was no built or character development at all...while watching the movie i saw new transformers die on both side, and i kept thinking to myself, ""how come they didn't introduce us to any of these characters"".Are you going to enjoy this movie? more than likely you won't, especially if you love the first and want the second one to be better.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Excellent summer movie,"Well, I honestly don't understand what all of the negative reviews are about. I mean...it's Transformers we're watching here. Giant robots trying to destroy other giant robots...I wasn't expecting a deep Oscar worthy plot. Just one that was good enough to hold your attention and that's what you got. The action is excellent..with tons of explosions and more fight scenes than part 1. While the movie is a tad long, it is a good watch and it's always exciting to see the 'bots transform. Shia does a very good job and is believable as he helps the audience to feel his difficulty leading a 'normal' life while there is an alien war going on that he can't avoid. Meagan Fox is wonderful on the eyes but she needs to work on her acting. Optimus Prime and Bumblebee stole the show in my eyes...again and it's clear Michael Bay is highlighting their heroic acts..and the audience in my cinema loves it. I will always remember the cheers in both installments when Prime first takes the screen. Bumblebee believes in Sam and will always be there to protect him. It's a toss up which one is better...but action wise, Revenge of the Fallen wins. If you enjoyed part 1, I don't see why you wouldn't enjoy this installment. You see tons more 'bots, and experience tons more action. Go see it!!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The boredom is unreal sometimes but what I will say is that the final 3rd of the film was awesome. I could probably watch the final battle over and over.The fallen was a very underused villain with a crappy death that should have had more... well, just more to it.VERDICTOverall this is an eh sequel with its fair share of great moments but it's so goddamn cheesy and cringe for me to like it.48%C-",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Disappointed,"I have been waiting anxiously for this film for like nine months. I loved the first one, then they filmed part of it here where I live and to top it off my husband had the honor of being an extra. All and all this was a great film, and it met all my expectations for action. It keeps your eyes on the screen at all times. However, I am very disappointed with the amount of sexual content as well as foul language. It is obvious that this is going to be something that children watch, I mean there are action figures for goodness sakes.

The one Transformers movie that's good.,"I actually saw this movie at a generally filled theater in Virginia around early July of 2009, a tad bit after it's official release in late June. I was 8 years old and I liked the first Transformers, although not as much as my brother, who was 6 at the time, who was a huge fanatic of all sorts of robots and creatures fighting in the Saturday morning cartoons, and he was extremely pumped, but I wasn't too excited, although I did think it looked like a good movie. I saw it with my family, and we loved it! I didn't know this got bad reviews at the time because I wasn't familiar with film critics, and I won't say it's perfect, but it's a great summer film in its own right. The action and special effects are extravagant, particularly the forest battle and whenever a computerized Transformer is interacting with a human character. But I'll say that some of the comedy maybe a little too awkward to watch with families, in addition, the Leo character wasn't important nor funny in the slightest. Other than a couple of small problems, ROTF is a ton of fun for Transformers fans and action movie fans.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Nice Effects... What Else?,"I was forced into seeing this movie and basically, I want my 2 and a half hours back and I want my hearing back.I like movies with action and that isn't what the turn off is in this movie. This movie seems like ALL they did was focus on the Special Effects and nothing else. I like movies with a story and depending on genre, a deep and thought out one. In this case, this movie was much like Terminator: Salvation. Only in T:S, there was good acting.The machines are smart right? Wrong. They have the worst dialogue I have ever heard. Well, not actually. They had terrible dialogue. Shia LaBeouf was more interesting then the machines, and that (in my opinion), is saying something. He isn't the best lead.I have to hand it to Michael Bay, the effects were very nice, but he wasted a ton of money. He just seemed to focus on the effects. This movie was missing everything needed to be a movie. A shame. Michael, stop blowing things up, make a story first, then blowing things up will be much more rewarding.2/10",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Ignore the Razzie Awards, This is one of the Best Movies of all time!!","I was very surprised to see the sequel to the original Transformers movie (which I really loved that movie). I bought tickets and popcorn to see the movie, and it's awesome.This is just as good as the original, with stunning CGI effects, great screenplay, and fantastic action sequences.The story is hard to explain, so I won't get into more detail. The cast members came back in this, like Shia Labeouf and Megan Fox, and the Transformers like the Autobots (Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Ratchet, etc, and let's not forget about the Decepticons, (Megatron, Starscream, Devastator, Blackout, etc.)Another ""must see"" movie and a ""must buy"" DVD or Blu-ray if you haven't seen it yet.The climax scene where they battle in Egypt was epic, almost close to the original climax scene where they battle in the city doing all sorts of destruction.The one thing that really gets me into a bad situation, it was nominated and won by the stupid Golden Raspberry Awards!!! And it won Worst Picture, shame on you!!!!! I wish Old Dogs or All About Steve should of won that award, instead, they had to pick this movie for the worst, Why? With Avatar nominated for Best Picture (Lost to The Hurt Locker) and this movie nominated and won for Worst Picture. Two great movies, but opposite award shows. Last years Best Picture winner was Slumdog Millionaire, and last years Worst Picture winner was The Love Guru, so that's the difference.

Cool movie - but slightly overdone,"So I watched the last show (11.30pm) on the first day in IMAX... the show was apparently sold out, but the usher allowed me anyways on a regular ticket - and I found a great seat at the back! So far so good... Lets get the good things out there... Great scenes - right from the urban fight scenes to the scenes over the pyramids! Great animation and transformation sequences. Shia LaBeouf looks very convincing as a college freshman, Bumble bee was at his best with his radio vocabulary. Bad things - so what was great as one or two scenes (street fights, transformations, freaky creatures), there were 50 of them in the movie... Megan Fox - supposedly the sexiest female on earth - shows up in every other shot with her glossed lips, brushed cheeks, mascara-ed eyelids and the permanent pout... great eye candy, but kinda gets in the way of most of the action. Michael Bay used her the best in the first movie, where she actually had a lot of action, but in this one, all she does is to run behind Shia, scream, ""bounce"", and tame a midget Decepticon! All in all, I want to love the movie - because I am such an unabashed fan... but the movie is overdone - with special effects - both transformers and sexy babes...",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An orgy for the eyes and the ears,"Well, this is not the kind of movie you will watch for the story. Let me talk about it first. The plot is conventionnal, it's the bad guys against the good guys and the US army is on the goods' side. The evil ones want to destroy the sun and the good ones need to stop them. How typical.The acting is not at his best. Shia did a great job but the love story between him and Megan Fox is just lame. All the other actors are useless. Best performance though : Hugo Weaving. man he rocks the Megatron guy!! Why did a put a 10? Well, if you own a home theater system : YOU GOTTA HAVE THIS ON BLURAY! The sound is just awesome. Oscar for sure in my opinion!Better than the first title. The visual effects are just killers. The action scenes blew my mind. The music is so epic. Well, it's an orgy for the eyes and the ears.I recommend this title if you like explosions, killer robot fight scenes and things like that. The US Army did a great job to help Bay.

Good movie but could have left out the sexual parts for the kids.,"As a whole I thought the movie was good. It was as to be expected for a summer blockbuster. The only complaint I had was the sexual material that was used and I watched three different sets of parents leave with their small children. Parents use extreme caution with any children under 1o years old. The sad thing is that the scenes were pointless and did not add or would not have taken away from the movie, so why were they added? Transformers at the heart is for the kids. The director should have taken that into account before adding those scenes.Visually I thought the movie was great. Like most sequels it lacks a good story line but they try to make up for it by adding more explosions and fighting. If your looking for a movie with lots of action then you'll like this movie.

An Amazing EYE POPPING spectacle,"I just got back from seeing Revenge of the Fallen. It was nowhere as BAD as the negative reviews have portrayed it.This movie was great fun. I took my daughter to see it because she loved the first movie and she thought it was awesome. Did it have its faults? Sure it did but first and foremost this is a movie about giant alien robots that transform into planes, cars and a variety of other items. To expect anything other than pure escapism is to delude oneself.The action sequences were very intense and the fight sequence in the forest is by far the most amazing thing put on film. My only major beef with the film was the sometimes inappropriate interjection of needless sexual references.The Autobot twins were hysterical and nowhere near the level of Jar Jar annoyance that some have claimed. This movie also showed how bad ass Bumblebee can actually be. My only other complaint is they included many new Autobots into the mix but overall screen time was lacking.

Mostly the same fast talking-smart mouthed kid that he always will be.Two: Devastator is not a tank.The latter irked me the most, and I was excited upon hearing that Bay said the real Devastator would be in the sequel.After a year of anticipation, I go to see it.This movie is filled with sexual humor that got old after the first hour. Shia plays the exact same character, as if it was difficult for him. Lastly, Bay ruined Devastator for the second time.I was in an okay mood with the movie because the special effects were unbelievable, Megan Fox was gorgeous as always, and I do enjoy seeing Optimus on screen.

Great Entertainment Overall...,"I went to see Transformers last night at my local cinema. I went in with an open mind because of the bad reviews that it has received on IMDb and in the local newspapers.However i have to say i really enjoyed the film. Its much like the first film with it's action and its humor which has been significantly cranked for this film, some times for the better other times its quite pointless. The films SFX are again breathtaking and slightly better than the first film. However, when there is a lot of action happening on screen the robots seem to move very quick so you cannot see anything very clearly, i am not sure if this is because its hard to get it clear whilst moving at fast speeds.Overall the film is slightly dragged out by about 30 mins but still fun nevertheless.

Disappointment... a major disappointment.,"Surprisingly i had really high expectations for this movie. I didn't even check IMDb. Which in my case is odd cause I always read comments before going to the cinema. I LOVED the first one, so I just expected Bay to get this as right as Nolan did on The Dark Knight... Silly me.In movies like this I can usually put up with cheesy clichés, dumb third grade jokes and .... who am i kidding, NO I CANNOT! I cannot believe i went to watch this movie with my girlfriend.Shia LaBeouf thinks that good acting equals repetitive screaming and stuttering. Megan Fox is unbelievable, literally. The plot is just a big gaping hole. Micheal Bay took the first film, amplified it by 200% and threw the story in the trash. But as long as he gets the cash, I guess it's okay. Every character in the film doesn't have to be a comedian! Particularly a bad and an annoying one (the twins). The story is... well there is no story.Personally I'm puzzled by the choice to put this film into production. What were they thinking?? Can't they tell good from bad?Furthermore, if I were an actor that starred in the first Transformers I would never agree to a script like that. I mean I wrote better essays than that in high school. My point is, they screwed up the franchise. I feel sorry for the fans including myself for paying to see this pile of crap.My suggestion is, if you only want to see big explosions and destruction. Plus you're capable of blocking out all the utter mix of nonsense that this film is, then go and catch it on the big screen. Otherwise save yourself of the disappointment and go buy a six-pack instead.Edit:I wrote this while still being angry at Mr. Bay for not making me care about the characters. I'll give it a 6/10. 5 for the mind blowing effects. 1 for the silly little plot.Bay should stick to effects (which he does best) and let other people worry about the plot.

"Too boring, too off-mark and too drawn out","I honestly thought this movie could have pulled things off in an hour and a half, maybe even an hour and ten minutes. There were too many unfunny comic reliefs, the sidekicks were off- mark and the entire movie is TOO long.I thoroughly enjoy watching Optimus Prime and the Autobots kick ass. I thoroughly enjoy Decepticons and their numerous gizmos. But serious, some Autobots and Decepticons didn't even get names, and if it wasn't for their size difference I wouldn't have been able to tell whether the Decepticons were Transformers or Terminators. There's THAT MUCH character to the individual Transformer. Even Prime seemed uncertain and wavering in this sequel.And the comic reliefs. They may have been hilarious for soft porn lovers, but they simply didn't cut it for a movie directed at young adults trying to catch a ride back into good old Transformers and young children who would have been looking for TRANSFORMING ROBOTS.Plus Bay never fails to put in as much kickass American MILITARY PRIDE in his movies. I'm not even going to comment on this; it's the guy's right as a director to do what he will to his movies, but I honestly don't think it'll sit well with many of the audience.Oh, did I mention that the movie is too long? I went into the movie theatre expecting nothing from the story-line (I mean, I was there to watch robots blow things up and get blown up) but the glaring plot-holes carried on and on and on and on....hanging out like some serpentine tongue.

"Big Action, Good Outcome!","I saw Transformers ROTF last night. Although; the story was crazy, the humour was in some parts too stupid, the film became confusing at points and the robot to audience connection was far less than in the first movie I thoroughly enjoyed this. I don't want to spoil anything for our American friends but be prepared for the first scene in Shanghai. In my eyes that part blows you away. What a great way to start the movie. It jumps straight in and hits you in the face with action from the off. The forest fight scene is also a mega deathmatch, although I would like to see it in Imax due to there being a longer cut for fighting in that version. Don't listen to the haters, listen here - Transformers 2 is a whirlpool of plot holes but you know what? Just enjoy it for what it is. Oh and by the way, Jetfire rules.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Softcore Porn meets Artillery Barrage,"I am at a loss to put into words the amount that Transformers, quite frankly, 'sucked.' The fact that a multi-million dollar budget and who- knows-how-many tonnes of explosives produced such a phenomenally uninteresting and poorly-crafted action film is beyond me. Micheal Bay, who I unashamedly call the village idiot of Hollywood, isn't able to maintain an engaging storyline (or what I would more accurately describe as a sensical arrangement of explosions) or for that matter an engaging anything. What ensues is a clumsy combination of hit and miss comedy, tediously long 'action' scenes, terribly written 'emotive' scenes and indecent use of the slow motion effect. Micheal Bay and the scriptwriters ought to be ashamed of themselves as well as the horde of idiots who have given this film a 10. I am shocked that Spielberg has had his name associated with such a pathetic excuse for a film. Wrestling fans: this is a must-see.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Weapons of Mass Destruction.,"College freshman Shia LaBeouf appears to be on his way to a normal life after the events of the original, but soon his mind is entranced with strange Egyptian symbols which hold the key for the Decepticons to use the sun as energy needed to take over the planet. Hit-and-miss sequel does basically accomplish what its predecessor did with non-stop action mixing with would-be witty one-liners, beautiful women, and sleek technologies. With all that said, ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" still lacks the complexities and depth of legitimate film-making vehicles to be much of a movie from a critical standpoint. Director Michael Bay would rather get thoughts across with confusing action sequences and seemingly unending chaos which often becomes more tiring and migraine-inducing than thought-provoking and interesting. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""Pretty"" good movie.","Overall, it was a good movie. I liked the action, but not so much the sexual jokes. While some may consider repeated sexual jokes funny, I don't think they belong in this movie; they belong in a Seth Rogen movie. There were also WAY too many robots. It was difficult to follow the robots and determine which robot is which. While the good robots were easy to tell apart, the Decepticons all look pretty similar. Megan Fox is going to end up in adult movies if she doesn't get some acting lessons, and that's the honest truth. Shia Labeouf was pretty good. He showed emotion and he was believable most of the time. If there's a third movie, the parents need to die.

Michael Bay is killing the art of film-making.,"A YouTube video can have more meaning than this second epic film in director Michael Bay's Transformers series. This isn't even the worst of it. $200 million was spent on making Revenge Of The Fallen, and it made 836 million green ones at the box-office. I was wise enough to avoid seeing it in a movie theater, but I still felt ripped off after watching it at home. If this is the sort of film that passes as a big money-making machine these days then what is the world coming to? As an experience the film leaves one feeling tired, but it still has its good points. The CGI is often amazing though sometimes it takes effort to figure out which transformer you're looking at. Bay is, no doubt, a very good director of visuals. He can direct actors towards good performances too. I will say that Shia LaBeouf does a good job playing Sam Witwicky. The script hurts the film for sure, and makes it like a cartoon. Things could have been good if the dialogue was more thoughtful and if the pacing was better. As it stands Revenge Of The Fallen is somewhat of a mess. If only the juvenile humor had been kept out. Some people criticized Megan Fox, but I say why? It's not like the other actors in the film did much better. She's just there to represent a piece of good ole suburban American ass. At least SHE called Michael Bay Hitler. Yeah, the film could have been better (perhaps much better) if the Bayness wasn't so plentiful. So, for every impressive battle featuring the mighty Optimus Prime there is a lame attempt at humor featuring a small transformer with a machine gun for a penis. I don't recommend seeing Revenge Of The Fallen, but children will probably enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Transformers 2: The BIG movie that couldn't?!?!,"Might have spoilers! I usually wait a few weeks to see the big ""Block Buster"" movies because I don't like lines or crowded theaters. For some reason my wife has been bugging me to take her and the kids to see this since it released on Tuesday. After waiting in line for an hour in the 95 degree California sun, we spent another half an hour in the theater before the movie started.First off, I went to the first movie because I have 2 school age kids that were wanting to see it. I hated the cartoon because of the juvenile humor and irritating voice characterizations. This first movie IMO had none of these things and was a fantastic action movie!(I gave it an 8) Within the first 10 minutes of the new movie I knew I was going to be disappointed. They added a lot of the voice crap from the cartoon I hated. Why does Hollywood have to ruin movies by adding stereo-typed characters to them? If I see another modern movie with a 70ies style jive voice in it I am going to freaking scream! I see this urban element in tons of the new movies, even in ones that are supposed to be in medieval times! WHY! WHY! WHY! This movie was trying to please way too many age groups IMO. There was way too much sophomoric humor in this movie that was being pushed toward a preteen crowd. I never thought I would spend my hard earned money to see dogs have sex, TWICE! I am not a prude be any means and I like seeing good looking women bent over in their panties but not when I am sitting next to my 13 year old daughter! One of these scenes actually had a soft-core porn feel to it! This movie was a very cool special effects ride with some parts that were just plain irritating! For the rating? I would say it borders on an R for the sexual content, language, drug use and adult humor.Worth seeing if you have money to burn and nothing to do on a Saturday Night but leave the 16 and under kids at home!Thanx for reading, Robert",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not worth your time.,"I love a good action movie. I've seen some good ones that were rated high - and deserved it. Like Terminator 2 and The Matrix. Haven't seen a good one for a while, and I did read the reviews here before I went to see this. I saw all the negative reviews. But the ones who loved this movie wrote things like: Excellent superb!! Brilliant...simply brilliant! etc. One even said it was a roller coaster ride in the theater! Wow! There were so many positive things said, I thought maybe the critics were just wrong. But.. they are right. This movie is nothing but special effects gone overboard. That's all it amounts to. There is absolutely no reason on earth to care about any of the characters.. Half way through, I almost got up to leave.. But gave it a fair shake. Wow! was I wrong! I should have gotten out when the getting was good.

This movie was great to me,"I mean some, well most people say its too long, but the dark knight and titanic were too long. And i hate long movies. But this one is an exception. Most likely if the movie is long, then it is boring, but that is the oppisite with transformers 2. This movie had so much action i had to wait to go to the bathroom because i didnt want to miss any of it. Yeah half the jokes were bad, but half were also very funny. Would u rather it just have boring parts instead of comedy... i didnt think so. I dont know why critics hate it, but its their job to do that. But that didnt stop the movie from grossing over $200 million in its first five days. And people came to see this movie for one reason, action and adventure. So just because some of u little wimps cant handle all of the action doesnt mean u have to give it bad reviews.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A terrible sequel of the Transformers franchise but not the worst one!,"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2012) is a forgettable, exhausting science fiction action film. Not the worst one in the series it still a good one in some moments. The worst one that would be Age of Extinction because the film it is just too long and boring. This movie was good, but it lacks on a story and it is forgettable for me. Sam Witwicky goes now for college and he wants to focus more now on his life. He accidentally cross a path on an ancient mystery implanted into his mind by the now-destroyed AllSpark, who has to now unravel ancient origins of the Transformers. Megatron wants to caught Sam while ancient mystery he has in his brain so he can resurrected Fallen and is planning the revenge on the world. Now Sam and his friends have to run for his life and try to stop the Decepticons before is too late. In this one Megatron dies, but on the end of the movie he actually get's resurrected and get's back to life and he stops Fallen. I liked the ending that was the perfect in the film.The film tends to sag in the middle when the action slows down to progress some of the silly plot. Transformers is not a film about plot, it's about the action - just keep it coming and don't try to make a story from it because it's RIDICULOUS; - Megan Fox still looks amazingly hot but cannot act to save her life. She was too hot and she just did not gave a good acting performance. You may as well just put a cardboard cut-out of her next to Shia Labeouf and it'll do the same job for a fraction of the cost; - A scene towards the end of the movie where there is a small ""dream sequence"" of sorts, and the word ""destiny"" is mentioned. I almost vomited. The word 'ridiculous' doesn't quite do it justice; - The girl that Sam meets at college and who she is. I am simply AMAZED that they actually let that whole thing get put into the movie - it just doesn't fit into the Transformers world and leaves stupendous plot holes and questions; - There isn't enough slow-motion in the action sequences for you to take it all in - Transformers trying to be ""funny"" - yuck.This movie had everything the fans were waiting for. The story fit, and didn't go willy-nilly. My honesty of the four Transformers. The first one is only the best one and worth to watch it. I watch this movie in 2011 before the third one was released and I thought was better than the first one but no it wasn't. The first movie I always enjoy this one I just can't. Transformers was the only movie I watch it several times. I give up with the last three, I only liked was the music theme they really had wonderful music theme. I didn't got it what was with those pyramid things and who of Transformers was who, they all looked the same The movie got me exhausted, I thought Mikaela was hot and sexy in the beginning of the movie on the bike and the story started wonderful but than just all blow it off and was too long. Sam annoyed me in the beginning when he started screaming Bumblebee and ugh. Transformers 2 is terrible lacking movie, confusing and is the worst story telling and I don't got it either what was with the story. The only thing I enjoy in the movie was the music.I Like Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen because of the music. 2.weeks ago I did got it 2 BD and I love it. I would watch the third one after the first one. The problem with Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen was Megan Fox she was to damn hot, she shouldn't be but not all that. They put to much romance than action and less story in it. The final battle in the pyramids wasn't that great as the first one was, Dark of the Moon is Better. The music makes the movies."" Anyway Movie - disappointing! Too much unnecessary comedy. The action was very good, but what was with all of the robot spit?The confusing plot about the film. One of the most popular, thrill-packed, franchises of all time is back with even more action and more Autobots and Decepticons! In the highly anticipated Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, Decepticon forces return to Earth on a mission to take Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) prisoner, after the young hero learns the truth about the ancient origins of the Transformers. Joining the mission to protect humankind is Optimus Prime, who forms an alliance with international armies for a second epic battle.I am giving this film a 6/10 because there were moments in the film that I did enjoy them, and there were moments I just couldn't enjoy and did not got it.

It is like Holly Sh...!!!.....in a good way & in a bad way!,"The film was good, especially because I watched it 14 hours before the premiere, in an empty cinema where I work. I was really excited to watch this movies, since the first trailer came out.Everything in this movie was good, awesome, nice, cool etc...the acting was good and the action between the robots is spectacular, but this it is where it gets complicated.I am a little of director myself, so I watch movies maybe a little different. The camera in actions sequences is too close and moves too fast when the robots are fighting. And the robots move too fast, when in battle. For example: when Optimus fights Megatron, Starscream and Blackout in the forest I couldn't see almost nothing, because they were moving too fast and the camera was too close too them. Good thing that Optimus is in red and blue colors'cause if he wouldn't be, I wouldn't tell the difference between them.Too close and too fast camera in this movie, especially in fight scenes.

Effects  just can't carry a movie anymore!,"The first Transformers was as all ""first"" are, was amazing purely for the transformation scenes...the script and immature comedic scenes just don't work for me. This one however, adds more idiotic comedic scenes with the parents and a plot that is disconnected and worst of all I hate to say, since Michael Bay directed this should have asked the camera folks to pan back a lot...the transformation scenes were so close you could not see the full effect, the quality was very poor and that was the best part. The parts that were edited should have remained and a lot of the parts that were in the movie were not needed...I got tired of seeing Ms. Tennessee Megan Fox puff up her lips and do all the things she thinks the guys are looking for in this movie, its called ""suggestive direction"". Any way I did remember that Shia hurt his hand while making the movie and miraculously I found Waldo from one scene with a good hand to the next scene a bandaged hand, talk about continuity! But as usual the suggestive direction, the effects and the sheer knowledge that Bay is associated, all made this movie a ""must see"" for many...and its obvious this is another chain of movies! but will the next one be a hit or miss, this one was a miss....C plus",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"More of the same old Michael Bay- All effects, no fun.","I really enjoyed the 2007 film Transformers and was disappointed it didn't win the Oscar for Best Visual Effects. When I heard of the sequel, Revenge of the Fallen, I was ready for an even better sequel. I heard it wasn't all that good via RottenTomatoes(19% rating currently), but I brushed that off. I even bought an IMAX ticket(this was my first non-zoo IMAX visit). What I got was 2 and a half hours of time lost and $13.50 as well. The critics were, right: this was one BIG disappointment.It follows Sam(Shia LaBeouf), who is now in a big relationship with Mikaela(Megan Fox), going to college while the Autobots, including good old' Optimus Prime(voice of Peter Cullen), have sided with human soldiers to take down all of the Decepticons on Earth. After touching a piece of the AllSpark, Sam's mind is filled with symbols and this information causes Sam to become a target of the Decepticons. Apparently the Fallen, a prime who really hates Earth. It's a basically another clash between good bots and bad bots. Oh yeah, and Megatron(voice of Hugo Weaving) has been revived and he's looking for a little revenge.For the positives. The film has great effects. It also has plenty more bots than the first film. And pretty much you have almost all of the major original characters(John Turturro, Tyrese Gibson, Josh Duhammel and even Kevin Dunn and Julie White as Sam's parents) from the first film, except for Jon Voight(good move on his part).On the negatives, it's mostly same old Bay, with a weak plot and lackluster performances. One of the film's new humans, Sam's college roommate and later companion Leo Spitz(Ramon Rodriguez), is utterly annoying. And that's just an example. Unfortunately, I didn't care much for the effects after the first 20 minutes, as the excessive running time really annoyed me(I checked my watch like 20 times). The film has plenty of moments that didn't need to be put in, and I even think some of the fight sequences were unnecessary. If I had my way, I'd shave out the useless bits, which would reduce the running time to 100-105 minutes. And what's with you, Michael? It's like he said, ""Okay, we need to focus mostly on our effects. Forget acting and story, get those effects guys on the hook now!!!!!!"" I thought the first film was his chance for a great comeback, but this just destroyed it. In fact, aside from Transformers, Bay hasn't done a decently good film since 1998's Armageddon. If they do a Transformers 3, hopefully they'll look on this film as what they should NOT do.Overall, I give Revenge of the Fallen a 4 out of 10. What a shame. And it's still going to make oodles of cash($672 million worldwide and counting).",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I think it is one of My favourite Movies!!!,"People have their own opinions on different movies and I liked Transformer: Revenge of the Fallen. I even bought it on DVD the other day and have watched it a couple time. I like the action, explosions, the sounds and the characters and the adventure they are on. People say it is the worst movie of the year, even though if you look into 2009 their were a lot worse movies. This is however my opinion. I didn't like The Blind Side and it is because it is not my type of entertainment. That is why award shows suck because it makes it seem like everyone agrees on the same thing. I don't even want to see half of the movies that are up for the best picture awards at the Oscars. In my opinion Michael Bay is a great director and I like a lot of his movies. Shia Labeouf in my opinion is the greatest young actor out there right now. I thought Megan Fox is a fine actress and Julie White is very funny. The tranformers are awesome and my favourite characters of all time. I can't wait for Transformers 3 to come out. I will be there the day it comes out in theatres.

My Take on Transformers 2,"I've noticed there are two different types of reviews. Those who completely hate this film and those who thought it was amazing. Well I don't really agree with either side on this one. While TF2 is certainly not brilliant, Bay knows how to entertain. Me and my friends went to see Transformers 2 and had a great time. We laughed at the cheesy dialogue, thought the special effects were awesome, decided to ignore the mediocre and melodramatic acting, forgot about the story, and had fun(also enjoyed Megan Fox).It's no 'One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest' or for that matter 'Terminator 2'(made by the true king of action films) but it's not supposed to be. It's supposed to be mindless fun, which doesn't take itself to seriously. All of Bay's films are like this. So enjoy TF2 for what it is. The best way to watch this movie is with a bunch of friends where you can laugh together and enjoy it. The problem with critics is that they get to critical, they forget about fun films. I love intellectual films where I have to think, but sometimes you just need to relax and escape real life.I give it a 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A complete lack of understanding of military tactics and hardware.Bad acting, sure. But with such a bad script and directing, it is hard to tell.

From the destruction of the pyramids to robots fighting, every scene looks so realistic.However, the good points seem to end there. Just like Michael Bay's previous effort ""Pearl Harbour"", the film drags on and is far too long. It is filled with mindless and pointless fighting scenes, as if they are fighting just for the sake of it. Most of the time I can't even work out whether the robot is good or bad. From the last Transformer movie, I thought the coloured robots are good and the silver ones are bad, but in this movie it seems the colour robots fight with the colour robots, silver ones fight with silver ones, and then everyone fight with each other.

the fall of the robots,"Were Transformers (2007) brought us something new this brings us a thing that I have some problems with. On part of the acting I don't have any problems but it's the way some things are done and shown that made me think, what the hell, this is for kiddies.The effects are again sublime but I do had a few problems with some transformers. There are two small cars that can transform, once they did they really reminded me of Cars (2006). They had teeth that were laughable and they also act childish. That doesn't add anything and makes this flick going towards the jokes done in M.I.B. (1997). But not only that, the talking of those small spider robots I didn't like either. In the first flick they talk their language but now they can talk English with an accent and again it doesn't make them believable anymore. The story itself is rather good although it's written in two sentences. There's still a part of The Cube on earth, by coincidence it's in Sam's hands.Megan Fox is here two years older than in Transformers and she is indeed more sexy and could have been the next thing but she showed that her mind was a terrible thing to taste. She had said stupid things toward the director Michael Bay and towards others which has led to the fall of Megan Fox. From becoming a blockbuster girl she is almost not seen anymore. She only performed in Jennifer's Body (2009) that was worth mentioning but was broken down by critics. The end for Fox.For me The Revenge Of The Fallen is on the edge of becoming ridiculous but the effects made it worth watching.

The start of the slope of bad Bay films,"This film is arguably the most highly anticipated release of the summer, and you can see the pressure must have got to Michael Bay with the amount of crap he put into this movie to lengthen it.Firstly, i will say the action scenes and visual effects are great, and the addition of new ""hip"" auto-bots is good for young viewers (not anyone else though), but unfortunately you only really see any action until the last half, and then its still separated by unnecessary and tiresome romantic scenes, and even then, the action scenes become tiresome with large amounts of 300 style slow-mo and an obvious intention of Michael Bay to show everyone how great his visual effects are.The first half is largely made up of useless footage of Sam at college and annoyingly frequent comedy scenes with his mum. The whole ""college"" section could have been compressed to about 20 to 25 minutes rather than an hour long, which have no impact on the story as a whole.The plot is not very good, and the stuff about the fallen is pretty gnarly. Its just a shame you don't find out about it till about the last third of the film, and there are a lot of plot holes - like why the hell didn't Sam give the splinter to Optimus Prime instead of his lame girlfriend?! But i think if they had started with the plot earlier and cut a lot of the ""in-between"" they could have made the film a lot more fun.Overall, it was fun, but the faults become tiresome and therefore make the film less entertaining and some what boring at times, especially with its long length (2 and a half hours i believe).

The Michael Bay Movie,"Oh my lord this movie is quite something. I will start with the fact that the action in this movie is awesome and definitely improves over the first movie. However, the writing is absolutely horrific; But I was never bored. I don't know why but the absolutely horrendous writing was so funny to me that it actually became fun to watch and it was hard to be bored. The huge exposition dumps were just so hilariously dumb to me and the way they just skip around and literally invent teleportation with no explanation is just hilarious. Michael Bay's humor runs completely wild in this movie and it is so so so bad that it just becomes hilarious. Pretty much this movie is what happens when Michael Bay has full control over the whole movie, over the top action, terrible writing, artificial emotional and epic moments, huge exposition dumps to get to the action faster, dumb Michael Bay humor, and nonsensical nonsense.

Lacks traits of its predecessor,"The first transformers film had a lot going for it. It's music, action, special effects and acting were all exceptional. But as for this sequel, it seems like the tone of the film needed to be changed. Transformers (2007) had realistic tone, every now and then it would inject some silly humor but that was to let its audience know that there was room for some laughs. But for Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009), it was decided that more comedy and slapstick was needed. But for what reason?For the most part, every component was kept relatively the same as the first. Some of the statement is good, while the other part, not so much. What's good are the special effects action and music. The transforming sounds are still there, as are the visuals and the explosive action. Even Steve Jablonsky returned to make a musical soundtrack for the film. What went wrong here was character placement and how that effected the tone.Megan Fox and Shia LaBeouf both reprised their roles as the popular couple, Mikaela and Sam. However, as I mentioned in the first review of this franchise, I would only forgive Mr. Witwicky for being so jittery because it was his first time being around alien robots. What do we have here? Mr. Witwicky is still jittery AND now he's screaming like a woos. Half of the running time in this film Shia LaBeouf is screaming. Even Megan Fox's character screams less than him. Enough with it LaBeouf! Did you ask to have a script with little dialog so you didn't talk much? He should be used to this kind of thing now.Then there's the character placement of Simmons (John Turturro). Turturro played a supporting character in the first film and now he's been moved to head honcho/plot motivator. Why do that? Some of Turturro's lines are really ridiculous or worse, inappropriate. This was supposed to add to the comical scenes but I didn't find very funny. Plus, writer Ehren Kruger thought it would be fun to pen in some loud- mouthed autobots as well. Yeah they weren't needed either.I enjoyed more of Mark Ryan's performance as the decrepit decepticon, Jetfire. It reminded me of the senior citizens of our time. For nostalgia purposes. And for the rest of the voice actors, they all return as well. Even Frank Welker is here this time, which was a nice addition. But again, all these good things can't override the abundant silly slapstick that is placed in this film.

Average.,"The first fifty minutes of the movie is like... A drag. A really long, boring, painful and slow drag. The story was a bit confusing and kinda lame. Plus, too much robots looked the same to me. It was difficult to tell which was which, apart from the obvious ones.Speaking of obvious... Too much obvious music playing in the back ground. Sad moment, sad music; Happy moment, happy music; Military deciding to go into battle against the Decepticons, military deciding to go into battle against the Decepticons music. It's like Bay was telling the audience what to feel, instead of letting the moment speak for itself. Really annoying.The acting was average. For a comedy movie that is.BUT, the last part of the movie, even if you don't get anything going on, don't like the acting, the music, etc., has some nice moments. dramatic and action-wise. So, instead of giving a 6 out of 10. I'll throw a 7. There are a few loose ends that the film never tie up, including the fate of some characters. That was disappointing also.Nice to see with some friends, and have some laughs, either, with the movie, or of the movie. Other than that, avoid.For me, Seven out of Ten.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Might be good if they snip an hour out,"Went to see this with my heavily pregnant wife hoping to take her mind off the aches and pains. Unfortunately, it had quite the opposite effect.I was a big fan of Transformers in the 80s and 90s. I liked the first movie, though I don't find LeBoeuf particularly watchable. I like some Bay movies (Bad Boys, The Rock, Armegeddon) and hated others (Pearl Harbor and Bad Boys II).This film was long. Way too long. It's almost 2 1/2 hours that could have easily, easily, been 45-60 minutes shorter. There are so many slow-motion shots of people diving away from explosions, or screaming aloud, or just doing nothing interesting that they could have saved 20 minutes just by taking those out.Most of the characters are ridiculous, especially LeBoeuf's Sam. He has to be one of the most unlikable main characters to appear in any blockbuster in living memory. The rest of the characters are all stupid, and wait around to have things explained to them that the audience have already guessed.The fight scenes are almost genius. If you're wondering what 2 giant robots slugging it out looks like, you will get your answers here. The 'choreography' of the fights is much better than the first movie. However, and I'm sure it's been noted before me, it's hard to work out who is fight who amid the noise and blur of steel on steel. In the final battle especially, you can't work out who is an Autobot and who is a Decepticon.The romance sub-plot is pretty poor, Sam's roommate is another annoying character. John Turturro almost saves the day until he spews out some pretty bad lines.If you're going to see this in the same frame of mind that you watched Charlies Angels in, then you might enjoy it. I was going just hoping to see a match of the first movie. Sadly, it's not nearly as enjoyable.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Mindless Fun,"You know the boys who smash toy cars together and go ""bam!, crash!""? Now replace toy cars with real cars and real explosions. That's basically Transformers 2. Also, the cars punch each other in the face and shoot rockets.Transformers 2 is a movie made by boys, made for boys. And as that, it's great fun. As an achievement in storytelling, you should rate it much, much lower. The script could have been written by a 9-year-old. What little there is to act as story makes little to no sense and sometimes comes out of nowhere. If Michael Bay wanted to create a cinematic masterpiece, he failed. What he did achieve though is a boy's dream of an action movie.Go see it if you can ignore the plot and enjoy the action for its own sake, otherwise don't.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Unoriginal Eye Candy,"The special effects for Transformers were over the top. The plot was unoriginal and a bit overshadowed by the constant action.Megan Fox is portrayed as possibly the most absolute sex object I have ever encountered in a movie. There isn't a single scene she is in where she is not portrayed as a sex object. She doesn't actually act. She just poses. I don't think the effects people were even satisfied with her natural charms. I am pretty sure they enhanced her using the same effects they used to simulate robots and explosions. Her lips are absolutely dripping wet all through the movie—like they added a coat of Vaseline between each shot. In all fairness, the target audience is adolescent males, so I have to cut them some slack.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Exciting Robot Fights; Could Do With Less Michael Bay.,"Well, I'm back. For sure, it was better than the first one, but I still can't stand Michael Bay's style. Mainly, his constant comic reliefs bug the hell out of me.In this review, I vaguely talk about the plot of the movie. It's not in depth at all, but if you don't want to hear anything before you see it, don't read.There's a bit of duality about my personality that conflicts me on this movie. On the one hand, I'm a techie electrical engineer (in training) who loves robots. Therefore, seeing big robots duke it out on screen is pretty enjoyable. On the other hand, there is the critical, contemplative side of me that enjoys movies with a lot of substance beyond explosions and mayhem. As such, I really enjoyed most of the fight scenes. However, the acting was all pretty much sub-par to par, and you never really get attached to any of the human characters. Optimus was probably the most emotionally convincing character in this movie, and he's completely CG!One thing that really bugged me was the disposition of the decepticons. The decepticons' story doesn't really fit how they behave. They're searching for something all transformers need, but they're willing to destroy life while trying to get it. Does that make them bad? Sure. However, it seems to me that they wouldn't actively revel in the destruction of that life. To put it in D&D terms (LOL), the decepticons' story should make them neutral-evil, while they act like chaotic-evil.Michael Bay likes to center his movies around a small group of protagonists against a large number of mostly faceless foes (except for 1 or 2 main bad guys). I think he chose the wrong group to center the movie around. Both transformers movies so far have pretty much revolved around Shia La Boeuf and his unarguably foxy companion Megan Fox (No surprise here that her first appearance on screen is more or less an upskirt shot). But this is Transformers! I don't care that this little dweeb is having girlfriend problems, I want to hear about the autobots and their problems. I'd like to see their characters developed more.As for the rating, they crammed in about as much ""light"" profanity as they could, while keeping it PG-13 level. You won't see any body parts flying around (aside from those of nonorganics), despite the explosions they so frequently stand on top of. I would've preferred a darker, more gritty rated R version, but I'm sure that wouldn't be nearly as profitable.As for the IMAX quality, before the movie was shot, an announcer came on and described the difference between the IMAX and 35mm versions. For most of the movie, the original aspect ratio (16:9 or something) is displayed (just much bigger than a regular theater). However, for certain scenes, the movie was shot with IMAX film, and IMAX viewers get to see some content that was not in the 35mm version. In these scenes, the entire IMAX screen was filled. I tried to notice when this happened, but I only caught 2 scenes. First was when optimus is fighting the decepticons in the woods. Second is the scene that really SUCKED (lots of SUCKING). If you've seen the movie, you should know which one I'm talking about.As I see it, there are 2 kinds of people in this world. There is the critical minority, which I belong to. Then there is the more receptive general public. 95% of the time, movies are made for the general public. Every now and then, a movie (such as The Dark Knight) comes along that can satisfy both parties. I would say that this movie is not quite one of them. It could have been, had Michael Bay not directed it. (On that note, 100% of Michael Bay's movies are made for the general public) For the TLDRers out there, I give this movie a 7.4/10.Jason",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Great graphics, but everything else falls far short","I should know better than to expect different from Michael Bay, but I decided to give this movie a shot. First off, clocking in at over 2 hours of playtime, the movie is considerably long. However, in the entire movie, they manage to shove in as many overdone scenes as they could manage to fit in, and the whole movie is apparently intended to be nothing but continual action. The story had major events happen extremely quick and were clouded out by ""everything else"" that they had in it (i.e. explosions, massive fight scenes with unnamed and forgettable characters, so on).First and foremost, I want to know the audience they were shooting for. Many of their humorous moments were extremely overdone and were questionable for why they would be put into the movie. Two dogs start humping out of nowhere...twice. The massive Decepticon is for some reason given a pair of metal ""testicals"" (wrecking balls from a construction vehicle). The mother getting high on pot brownies and proceeding to make an ass of herself for no reason. The jokes were extremely childish and way out of place, but at the same time were definitely unnecessary for any child to see. In fact, about 90% of the movies humor is through blatant sexuality, and again...most times for no good reason.Beyond that, the many overused, overdone scenes that just make you cringe keep popping up. The ""say you love me"" ""I don't want to yet"" stuff got old right off the bat. The mother being extremely clingy. My favorite has to be something I have seen so many times and it continues to make me face-palm...the ""You have to let me go, dad!"" scenes, where the kid has to save the world or whatever, and the dad doesn't want to let him, so he screams ""you have to let me go!"" until the dad breaks down and gives in. It's no longer moving or meaningful after excessive use. War of the Worlds did the same thing and it was just as bad.The plot was extremely basic but took so long to happen, and was even harder to enjoy with the gratuitous amounts of overdone and at times unnecessary action sequences. 2 minutes of plot advancement, then 20-30 minutes of fight and action scenes, rinse and repeat. Many unknowns are killed off rather easily, even the massive one near the end (not spoiling, you'll see if you haven't). At the end, you feel like the story wasn't that important, and while it could have been much better, it falls far short.The only saving grace has to be the graphics...this definitely had to be a difficult film for the animators due to the massive amount of CGI needing to be done. Still, many scenes are so quick moving that you can't really marvel at the detail put into the characters. Most of it looks messy and disorganized at times. It was large amounts of work, which looks impressive at a distance, but looking closer you pick up on how it feels like no deep detail was done on the bots, and a lot of things feel thrown together.So, all in all, surprised as hell this movie stands at a 7.5 right now, I expect that to go down significantly, but I agree with a line from a great song...""Why does Michael Bay get to keep on making movies?"" Very disappointed, and so were many of the people that went to see the movie with me.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

After actually avoiding the release of this one, i was lured into watching it by my friends. I told them why i didn't like the first one and they said the second was a lot better. Basically my problem with both installments is that it seems that both were made with 8-12 year olds in mind. 8-12 year olds are gonna see a movie about robots that turn into cars no matter what the story line is, so they should have had a good one, also they should not have geared the movie for kids, instead they should have made them both for the adults, the kids who used to watch them, but that are now much more savvy. p.s. did the whole movie have to be made in slow motion? its running time is listed as 150 minutes, it could easily have been 90 minutes without all the slow motion parts.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen - A Wavy Davy Review,"Ridiculous! What an absolutely ridiculous movie! I still cannot decide whether I detest or love this movie and the swirl of robot carnage which Michael Bay delivers slickly. I have plumped for a diplomatic seven as it neither deserves full praise, no film by Michael Bay does, yet I came out with my adolescent male blood pumping to Linkin Park's great new song.Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is trying to forget about the events of the first film, and even leaves his loyal friend Bumblebee, parents and girlfriend (Megan Fox) to go to college. (Once again Fox displays a lack of acting ability, but I think we will forgive her for that). Sam discovers a remaining piece of the Allspark, which imprints a map onto his mind (seriously!) to a device which can destroy our Sun. With the resurrection of Megatron, and the return of his scheming master The Fallen, Sam is suddenly in high demand, with everyone wanting his mind. Sam goes globetrotting with a century old Deception, his sleazy college room-mate (they never seem to ask him what he is doing with them!), and other friends from the last movie. To make things worse, Sam's ever embarrassing parents are captured by the Decepticons (a very strange, and seemingly unnecessary sub-plot). This messy storyline turns into a mission to save the Earth, so Sam must save the day.Does that seem a lot of information for a Michael Bay film? Well, that is because it is a lot. It is too long at two and a half hours, something I noticed clearly with the high proportion of people needing to nip out to the toilet. There is a fabulous scene in forestry where Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) fights off multiple Decepticons, which could probably have served as the end of the movie. Instead, it is dragged out for another hour or so, leaving the audience a bit tired and, I have to say, the excitement of seeing crazily complicated fights between robots has waned. There is also a distinct feeling that Bay simply has a craving for Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson walking in slow motion, as except for these cool shots there was no other reason for them in this film. Ultimately, what can a sharp shooting soldier really do against killer machines that turn into very cool cars? We even get a strange few lines from an English soldier whose accent is as strong as the robots themselves.There is not a similar feeling of worthlessness to John Turturro's return as Agent Simmons, now living at a deli with his mother. Turturro actually rescues the film when interest begins to fade, and lifts it to the climax at the end.Despite Turturro's injection of humour and interest, Revenge of the Fallen cannot hide from the fact that it has a very, very similar plot to that of the first movie. Both end up with similar scenes, Sam running to stop the Decepticons from using a machine (the Allspark before, and now the Matrix) to destroy the world. Part of the reason these films are just SO insanely stupid is the fact that the villains are too one dimensional, with seemingly very little reason to destroy the earth other than their hatred of the Autobots (does that make sense?).Some may say this film was just too ridiculous. I thought that for a while. But then I thought, is it any more ridiculous than a small man with hairy feet trying to destroy a ring, or Bruce Willis saving the world from an asteroid? Transformers 2 has some comic moments, some exciting moments and even some sad moments, but not enough of these pockets of quality to fill the two and a half hour run-time. It is a fun action romp, but be prepared! For full enjoyment be willing to turn off all, and I mean ALL ounce of common sense!7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Distinctly average,"I went to watch TF 2 yesterday & I thought the film was an excellent advert for ILM & their skills but it was distinctly average in terms of entertainment. It's got more transformers than the previous film but throughout the course of watching it, you'll forget who they are or how they fit into the story. It's also got a fair amount of action but these scenes seem to be completely devoid of any sense of menace / urgency or danger. It also got a ridiculous amount of comic relief, most of which completely misses the target, although the fun element provided by Sam's parents is as welcome as ever.

More than meets the eye: less than meets the brain,"To make an awkward analogy, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is like a stupid and superficial party-crazy super-model on drugs with a car/military fetish. This is a tough movie to review. It's bound to make a ton of money even though the professional critics pretty much hated it. Who's wrong? the public who pays to see it and liked it or the critics? If I don't like it, am I being snobbish and expecting too much of a summer popcorn blockbuster? I liked the first movie way more than I expected, it was fun, spectacular, exciting and the robots were cool. The second movie left me numb and perplexed. It starts well enough with a thrilling action sequence (where you do have trouble identifying who are the good and bad guys, a recurring problem) followed by a relaxed scene showing the funny returning parents (love the mother) and the upcoming trip to college by Sam (played by Shia Labeouf who does a very good job as usual). At that point, the movie still felt right.I'm not sure how a rather simple plot became confusing. I also had trouble caring about the fate of the characters. Since I'm not particularly dumb and tend to enjoy more complex films, I'll attribute this to bad storytelling. There's even a big deus ex machina for good measure, sign of the lazy writer. The film is also blatantly commercial and excels into making American military look heroic so if those things bug you, steer clear. On one hand, the visual effects are awesome, on the other hand the writing sucks and the dialog is trite. The actions scenes are spectacular but very busy and too often you have trouble identifying the fighting robots. The robots have virtually no characterization and often go unnamed. The exceptions would be Bumblebee but only at the start, the little twin cars who are not only annoying but hard to understand, an older bearded robot seen later on and a tiny hyperactive radio-controlled monster truck. There's a huge variety of Transformers, they look amazing and their transformations are even better than the first film but how I wish they had at least some of the minimal characterizations of the TV shows. Is that too much to ask?The music is appropriately bombastic or heroic. The sound effects are loud and powerful. Yet the sound mix is sometimes bad, drowning out the voices. The director Michael Bay is quite good at making visually impressive set pieces and money shots (he loves his slow-motion) yet he falters in other ways. The movie logs in at around 2 hours and a half. It started feeling long mid-way through. The old returning characters are still the best, the new ones, either human or robotic, are lackluster. It's certainly not as good as the first film, which to be fair, had the novelty factor going for it. The human parts are not as clever or engaging. There's more robots but keeping track is confusing and it's almost too much of a good thing. The sequel has more of everything except storyline, human touch and charm. If you liked the first, you'll likely be curious to see the sequel, if you haven't done already, but I wouldn't pay full price for it. If you're a male who loves hot babes, hot rods/robots, cool action and lots of explosions, you're going to love this. I was disappointed but not as much as the critics said I should be.Rating: 5.5 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I wish it can transform into something worth watching.,"If you haven't seen this movie yet, don't! You are better off watching something else instead. This movie is a big middle finger to the audience and mocks their level of intelligence. Michael Bay obviously thinks that SFX = good movie. I cannot even begin to mention all the inconsistencies and plot holes this movie has because I do not know where to start. There were too much action and stuff going on all at once, stuff that doesn't make sense, even for a movie. It seems that all the big booms were specially made to cover up for the bad storyline. The jokes were crude, dog humping, robot on legs humping and there were racially-offensive robots. It is just awful.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
very ashamed,"Transformers revenge of the fallen is a perfect example of greedy and money hungry companies wanting to cash in on a good movies response, and bring in a sequel with no heart or enthusiasm, only putting it out there just to make money.

I must admit that Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen.....,"I must admit that Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen was my most anticipated movie of the summer, maybe even the year. I was really impressed with the first one, so it was hard not to have high expectations for Michael Bay's second installment. I heard certain complaints about the plot, but I find it somewhat interesting as it uses different time periods and introduces some new characters. As the title indicates, the story involves the Decepticons gathering up their forces for another epic battle. I don't want to say too much just in case you haven't seen either of the two movies. As would be expected, the first one should be viewed before seeing this one to get the full effect of the story, but the sequel actually stands quite well on its own. There's an equal blend of comedy and action, but the humor was hit-and-miss to me. The first few minutes were downright hilarious thanks to Kevin Dunn and Julie White (the parents), but later on the humor relies on corny, low-brow jokes and visuals which makes me groan more than laugh. I much prefer the slight dramatic touch of the first movie that this one lacks. While I'm nitpicking, I'll point out that the cinematography during the action scenes are a bit blurry and seem to be too close-up, which is a problem I see in most action movies to be honest. Also, it feels like all sense of scale was abandoned. How does a small sports car like a Camaro become four stories tall and appear to weigh 20 tons just because it transformed into robot form? Oh well, like I said, that's nitpicking the little stuff. Even though this film does not quite blow me away like I had hoped, it is a strong, entertaining movie, especially for a sequel. The props are outstanding, with the amazingly cool Chevrolet vehicles, fighter jets, etc. Plus, what's more awesome than a semi truck personified? The sound effects are well done, but this is an action movie after all. Shia LaBeouf has always made me laugh since his days on ""Even Stevens"" and there has never been a more aptly named actress than Megan Fox. As far as the soundtrack goes, I've been really impressed with the Linkin Park songs for the ending credits on both films; they just seem to fit.

During which, when some robot gets slagged you don't know who it is or care. The few fights that do occur are well done. But a few parts are omitted or edited past without explanation. Overall the movie is about 1/2 hour too long. And it falls short for the typical Michael Bay film.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Worst movie since Matrix 3,"This was a Truly terrible film. After seeing this film, I asked all my friends (who saw the film independently) to rate the film out of 10. It scored and average of 2.5I'm not even kidding about this - please do not watch this film. It was appalling. One of my friends suggested he'd have a better time going to the see side and hurling 10 £1 coins into the sea!OK, so why's it so bad? MICHAEL BAY like all humans loves money. No effort was put into script writing. The dialogue was appalling... I think my least favourite aspect of the film was the introduction of 2 ""gangsta"" autobots who tried to talk like they were ""from da hood"". AWFUL!!There was a joke at the end pertaining to the testicles of a decepticon. One of my friends compared it to going to see a stand up show where the comedian defecated on the audience for 3 hours then told a knock knock joke. It got no laughs whatsoever. In fact, about 1/3 of the audience were asleep at this point because of 30 minutes of BORING fighting.I think the CGI and action scenes took a turn for the worse in this movie. Also: there was no suspense, unlike in Transformers 1. Anything that was good about Transformers 1 has been removed to make this movie.After the first movie, the 2 main comments to Michael Bay were:1) REMOVE THE HUMANS and 2) FFS, PUT PRIME'S MASK BACK ON!!So Bay responds by keeping Prime's TERRIBLE lips and adding more useless humans to the mix. As if that's not enough, he introduces some new transformers that talk like gangstas. The introduction of these robots made me so angry, I felt sick. I like my giant robot battles to be serious and dark (like the trailer suggests). Thanks false advertising.I'm not sure I can continue with this review without getting SUPER cross. Please, just do not go see this movie. If you're curious, wait until it is out on DVD and download it. Do not, under any circumstances, pay money to view this movie. You'll feel robbed and almost certainly demand your money back!",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What's the point ?,"Don't get me wrong, I love the Transformers movie franchise, but there are alot of missing pieces. For instance, if there are decepticons or ""pretenders"" that can take on a human form, than why do they even bother using a vehicle form? Wouldn't it be easier to take over earth if they all looked like humans? Anyway, I love that Megan fox was in this one and I hope they fill in some of the gaps in their timeline in future films. I can watch this and or any other Transformers movie over and over and over again, and never get tired of it!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
And to think that I didn't want to watch Dragonball: Evolution...,"Given the fact that there is no ""0"" nor negative scores on IMDb; I just went and raised a star on every movie I've ever rated here, because after watching T2:TROTF i honestly believe no other picture deserves a ""1"". This is the worst movie ever. Not the worst movie I've ever seen, the worst movie ever made. Normally I disregard trolls and people who just go and throw a random commentary like that, but now, I feel powerless beyond belief, beholding this crime against moviegoers.Even if you thought the first one was good, this one is going to disappoint you to tears. If you felt N#1 was awful (like I did), this should be obvious; don't commit my stupid mistake; at least the first one had John Voight blabbering stupidity. Even though I feel happy because he isn't around this one to further tarnish his career, my heart bleeds for John Turturro, who's role here is even more idiotic than the one he had in numero uno. Not even Megan Fox's Bayesque cleavage and bouncing is a good enough reason to suffer through this.Story? Plot line? acting? None. None that you can understand at least. Everybody is terrible, but specially the lead. Just wait till Shia starts acting possessed or whatever (man I wish I could kick his butt!) and claims that he just read a book in two minutes and found that ""Einstein was wrong"". Your IQ will go down just by hearing that. A special mention should go to the main character's parents, a couple of the utter-most imaginable annoyance.OK, maybe you're saying ""hey man, you are a retard, you went and see Transformers expecting plot line??!! it's about FX!! Well, I'm not that naive of course, so that was my original thought. And no, not even what's supposed to be the movie's forte was good. Action was stupid and senseless, trying to catch moments of brilliance of far superior previous movies like 300. Na, here you have Devastator's Scrotum (textually), and a couple of the most racist clichés made into robots.You don't believe me? well, just go ahead and watch it. Go and watch how bumble bee has been demoted to an even more stupid scoobby doo. Look how Optimus Prime has become a bully with a gun.I just hope this flops at the box office. Not because I want Micheal Bay to stop making movies (even though I do), Not because I want these awful, awful 2 hours and a half of disastrous boredom to lose money (I don't really care). I want this to flop because that way, I would know there's still some notion of common sense around.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This film shall not be judged by Shakespeare,"Let's talk for a moment on the notion to quote Shakespeare in the review of a Michael Bay film: As children we are raised to appreciate Hamlet, or Romeo and Juliette, or Henry IV ... and yet the appreciation of Elizabethan dialect, iambic pentameter, and Danish teen angst do not come so easily to us. You must be taught to appreciate Shakespeare.To a film viewer entering an imax theater for a sold out show to Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, much like going to see Hamlet in the Park, you are stepping into a period piece. If you did not grow up listening to Run DMC and the Beastie Boys, and watching Transformers and Voltron on Saturday mornings, the experience will feel like two-and-a-half hours of nonsequiturs over-wrought by a cacophony of metallic crashes, and dialects that would make Buckwheat frown with embarrassment.But this is a period piece, and to the children of baby boomers and hippies -- and more specifically the children raised by Bugs Bunny slapstick and a sense of ethics born out of the age old battles of Heman and Skeletor -- there is real grace here. If you don't know the difference between Space Ghost and Moltar, or Gloop and Gleep, then it is a grace you might never see.Film in a large way is meant to be ... at least eccentric, and not a far leap from esoteric. It should be a goal of a film maker to bring light to things that people might miss. Why else would we praise film makers like Fassbinder and Herzog? This noted, Transformers IS dumb. I'll be the first to admit that. But the script by Kurtzman and Orci, and the banter as it's executed by Lebouf, Fox, and Duhamel carry the story as though it had always been a part of the series -- much in the same way the Star Trek revival carried the character of the original series.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It got needless and ludicrously bad reviews and I just don't understand,"People call it cheesy, people call it unbelievable and weak. People criticize it's story line. But do these apparent ""professional"" reviewers know what they're watching at all? I'll be hopefully the one of many to tell them that it's Transformers for god sakes! The last thing that I would expect out of an action thriller involving robots/vehicles coinciding with humans to help the planet for the greater good is a deep meaning or moral at the climax of all the CGI special effects! People striving for Oscars strive for a good strong story, not an action/thriller! I mean at the end of the day, it's Transformers we're watching, a former kids TV show.  I would hardly expect to find a massive deep, strengthened story line after it's history of childish, cartoon programming. So what I'm getting at Is, is that this movie did what it was supposed to do. It lived up to the action category!i Drama needs solid story lines far more than anything else in the movie business, so those who judge Transformers on plot are sadly mislead. Transformers (like every movie) needs a structure. It had one. Maybe a bit of a cheesy one, but, to the fools who analyze and criticize it based on plot, remember what your watching.I mean, dear God! I paid a couple of bucks to see what I hoped to be a thriller that performed to it's genre from start to finish, and let me tell you, it did just that (and over achieved on top of everything else). Transformers was marinaded by non stop thrills and adrenaline kicks of pure action! And the CGI was impeccable! So smooth to watch brawling robots in such crisp detail with the sound effects off the scales in terms of perfection.It didn't need a strong story line to keep it together. Transformers 2 was the whole package and should only be judged on the category that it performed so fantastically to!Don't over analyze it and you'll enjoy the show!Overall rating 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
So-So,"This movie was good, but it could have been better. My biggest complaint was that the battle to get to Optimus took forever. There was too much fighting going on for way too long. I also did not like the moron that they turned Sam's mother into or the way that they over-sexed Megan Fox's character. The new autobots and decipticons were impressive. All of the hype about the twins is not a stereotype that white people put on blacks, but a portrayal of what many blacks have made as a recognizable as a rapper stereotype. They were comical characters. As usual, Bumblebee was great. His emotions were endearing. The scenes with the dogs were not needed. This movie could have excluded so much and it would have been a better movie. It was worth the price of admission and not a total bomb.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Bad and Dumb,"The Transformer 1st was dumb, how could anyone expect the 2nd to be good one??? This member has best described the movie so I am just copying and pasting his comment, because I believe he is true. Anyone wit a little brain do not watch this movie, but it is meant only for brain less children, and making it a Box Office hit.""When Shakespeare's Hamlet spoke of life being ""...a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury; signifying nothing."" he was actually referring to a Michael Bay film. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is the movie equivalent of a 13 year old boy who has stopped taking his ADHD meds and overindulged on caffeine, sugar, video games and porn. It makes me wonder if Michael Bay actually is a 13 year old boy--the victim of a tragic case of arrested development. 13 year old boys also appear to be the target demographic that this movie was made for.In Revenge of the Fallen the dialog mostly consists of people yelling inanities at each other and robots making expository speeches that attempt to provide some vague skeleton of a plot. The female characters are either soft-porn eye candy or blithering idiots. Or both. The violence is almost non-stop, interrupted occasionally by jokes which revolve around scrotums and testicles and oral sex and humping. The ethnic stereotypes are shocking. The homophobia is palpable. This film displays all of the tact, intellect and decency of a locker room full of pubescent boys.Once the action kicks in, it is relentless. The battling robots are mostly incomprehensible blurs of motion and color and clanging noises. The music pounds. Guns and cannons fire. Jets roar. Things explode. The characters run and yell. It quickly becomes tedious, but it goes on and on and on like this. When it was over, I walked out of the theater dizzy.The best part of seeing Revenge of the Fallen was when I left the theater, got into my car, closed my eyes and basked in sweet silence.

"So different,","To see the Transformers not in cartoon motion is so different, especially if you are a big fan of the classic ones. In the last part, it was good to see the new detailed versions of the transformers, although it was off the track from the classics, but it was descent and a good movie.The new part however is so different, it feels like the new series is going to be ruined, and won't last more than another movie (if it survived). One of the most disappointing things is the lack of transformers original character's behavior, it is becoming so American with many ""funny"" comments, especially for the Autobots, which is so different from the original characters and not good at all.As for the action, it is a good thing to have too many action, but the big problem is that you will not know who's with who! And there is a specific scene near the end where you will get totally confused, there are too many characters, many of them didn't appear in the classics, and so you have no clue who they are, and you won't know what's happening and what's the role of every character even when the fight is over!The human involvement is one of the biggest holes in the new sequel; it is supposed to be a robot war, with no involvement of humans, in the first movie it was OK, but in this one, it is not OK at all. The spotlight is for the very most of time on the human characters and their lives, to the point that makes you feel you're watching a ""human"" movie with a ""robotic"" involvement!Imagine the old series to be done in present days with the new graphics achievements, and maybe adding some very little human involvement to spice it up, would't that be wonderful? I really hope writers, producers, and directors start thinking about what people really wants not what they see people want.Conclusion; go watch the movie, it's worth to be seen, but don't watch like a classic transformer fan, just as an action movie fan 7/10 for an action movie 4/10 for a transformer movie",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Yet another high-fund/low fun, CGI circus that's unable to hold attention, or add plot.","There are so many things wrong with Transformers: RotF. Let me begin in a top-ten list format to quickly express my gripes: 1.First, the movie was too long, clocking in at 150min: Basically depending on how far you commute to your local theater, you are wasting an estimated +3hr on this mediocre, brainless summer flick.2.Second the plot, or lack thereof: Yes there was a plot and yes it was BARELY enough to keep this fireworks show of silly action scenes moving forward. The movie is all mindless action, no character interaction or simple character building. Only what is necessary to move the action scenes forward.3.Excessive Product placement anyone? Are transformers limited to GM products only? Why did we need to hear that Sam's parents are insured by Allstate? 4. Once the first Transformers was announced, EVERYONE suddenly expressed they were Die-hard Transformers fans and that they had been fans since a very young age, much like when superman,spider-man,xmen, hell-boy,fantastic 4, and both In.Hulks were announced: they are probably lying and are failing at pretending they are ""cool"" 5. Most die hard Transformers fans, like myself, hate this movie. However most people looking for a simple action movie DID enjoy it.6.Megan Fox-Very attractive don't get me wrong, but she couldn't act herself out of an episode of Blue's Clues. Ill sacrifice a nice pair of legs and pretty face for an actress that can do other things then bend over in front of the camera.7.Why did Dreamworks approve a second Transformers? Because the simple fact that: it makes bank. The movie is mindless spending and random effects and explosions trying to shield a bad script and bad plot.8.The non-funny ""unneeded"" transformers: They are not funny, nor did they contribute to the story progression whatsoever.9.CGI: The action scenes are too detailed and hectic for the average human to fully appreciate in one viewing, thus most action scenes are ""too"" gorgeous, and I say that meaning that the illusion that the movie aims to create with CGI is way overdone, and it feels like you are playing a really detailed computer game rather than the adrenaline filled film it could have been.10. The under use of Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson. It seems to me that these two were put in the movie ONLY to boast about, and NOT to have any significant role in the progression of the film. The movie changes NONE if Tyrese had not been in it, heck all he says is a smart comment like ""we're about to get our asses whooped!"" or the movie changing quote of ""that guy is an asshole!"". You really should wonder if those making this movie are insulting your intelligence?",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Mr. Bay hats off to you.,"How to spend 200 million dollars in 2 ½ hour? Michael Bay knows better than others. This movie sets a bar on the technicality for future movies. I agree with the lack of plot and acting performance, but one should also remember that making the plot too intense would have forced Mr. Bay to divert his attention, time and money from the superb action sequences. This movie is like a good chick flick where you do not have to apply your brain except it has superb action sequences. So put your brain to rest for a while and just enjoy the human feat that has been achieved by the special effect guys. Hat's off to special effect guys. Before watching this movie, I was told that this movie is bad and I had the same perception, but it became thinner with the progress of the movie and I must say I enjoyed the entire movie. I have hard time watching a movie which is more than 2 hours long, but the storyline of this movie is fast and keeps you involved till its last frame. Movies like a transformer suffer from legacy problem, since they are derived from a cartoon series which have more than 50 episodes under their belt, and viewers have high expectations from it. Though these movies provides a great assistance in creating a plot, but at the same time also forces the director to give more importance to the theme, which in case of transformers is robots. Therefore I believe that expecting a plot like Batman or Lord of the rings will be injustice to this movie. This movie is lot better than Pirates of Caribbean (2 -3) and Spiderman (2-3). So it's a must see movie that too in a theater. One suggestion to the future viewers, do sit as far as possible from the screen, otherwise you will have hard time watching it because gigantic robotic action. It's worth the time and money I spent for the ticket.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Mr.Spielberg please suspend Michael Bay from his office!!!,"I never saw so much crap put together in one movie! No character-development, no plot development, because there is no plot, horrible dialogs directly copied from other trash-movies, simply one of the worst screenplays ever put to film. No wonder the complete acting is horrible too. The best thing is Ehren Kruger and Robert Orci got paid for this dunghill. And on top of it...Michael Bay! A puffed up rooster on his dunghill and he is clearly not aware of it!! There is no other explanation for this catastrophe. Even in the action sequences Bay is a gyp artist. Explosions here, explosions there, everything is bleary, shaky cam, rushing cam, zooming cam. You can hardly follow up what's happening. Bay only PRETENDS dynamic and speed. Watch the last 45 Minutes of Aliens and you have REAL action sequences. Many who saw the film complained about the ""Twins-Transformers""(new JarJar Binks, clichéd voices, racial insults, etc.) Asked about that Michael Bay blamed the voice actors! WTF!!! Shame on you, Mr.Bay! You were in charge for this debacle!! You, as the director, are responsible which lines from the screenplay comes to life on the big screen. You have no guts! I will end with a quote from another user, because it's an excellent conclusion to this garbage: ""This movie is a disgrace to film-making and the entire industry.

Unbelievable...,"What were they thinking?! Why did none of the actors ask the writers, producers, and director ""Are you serious?"", but yet most fans are asking that and many other questions? I, along with many other people in my movie theater, were bored halfway through this movie. One guy beside me asked his buddy ""How much longer til this is over?"".My problems with this movie: Terrible story (if there was one), atrocious acting, and the dialogue at times was annoying...especially the dialogue of the Transformers. Since when do Transformers swear, insult other humans, and have mechanical testicles?

And I quite liked the original, but if your IQ is in the 3 digit range and you are over 14, give this a miss.It's also racist - ""jive"" robots for God's sake - and sexist, with the female lead doing nothing more than not wearing a bra in endless slo-mo shots.Avoid at all costs.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Exciting Yes.  But Also Disappointing,"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is as exciting as summer blockbusters go. The signature Michael Bay explosions are definitely there. The machinery and the cars were all a great sight to see, as well as Megan Fox. The robot transformations scenes, the chase scenes, the fight scenes, all very excellently staged and executed as far as visual effects are concerned.However, for this particular blockbuster, I think the main problem is story-telling. When we understand what the Fallen meant, it seemed insignificant already. Focus is seriously lacking. It seems that story telling fell secondary to the explosive special effects and occasionally lame comedy schticks (particularly from Sam's mom and his roommate Leo).Part of this problem is time management. Everything in the script took too long to tell on screen. One example of a particularly over-long sequence is the climactic run of Sam to deliver the Matrix to Optimus Prime. It was one very extended series of indistinguishable gun battles interrupted by seemingly endless scenes of our two heroes running. Of course, these running scenes had to be in slow motion in order to emphasize Megan's jiggling anatomy for the boys in the audience (haha!)As a whole, it is OK for a lazy afternoon with the kids, as we did so today. The kids found it awesome and extreme, as could be predicted. However, we know there could have been better story-telling by its director, who seemed to be more concerned with the superficial embellishments rather than the core spirit of the story.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Unbalanced, yet isn't this what we asked for?","When the first movie released the reviews were great, some were bad but more than anything the most recurring ""flaw"" so to say was there wasn't enough Transformers screen time. Well, we got it... 2 1/2 of almost literally all action and Transformers scenes. I am not exaggerating when I say there are probably less than 10 scenes in this movie without a Transformer in it. Though the thought of 2 1/2 of pure Transformers action may seem appealing at first... I'll be the first to say it can become mind-numbing. Also, I must add that I am a HUGE Transformers fan and even for someone like me this became almost redundant. Overall this movie is quite good though, but 2 1/2 hours is just too much and that's what drives it down from an 8 to a 7 for me. It's 4:11am I just got back from the movie I'm not completely coherent so please forgive me. I should have waited to do this but I felt the urge to do it ASAP.Final Thoughts: This movie is like the counter weight of the first movie and together they balance each other out quite well. The first movie focused more on us, the humans, and our reactions and actions to toward the Transformers. In this movie the main focus by far is the Transformers. Little explanation involved in this one.. almost all action with a little comedy and slight drama thrown in. This movie could not stand alone without the first movie which isn't a bad thing though. I like that Bay used the first movie as the entire foundation for an action packed sequel so he would not have a need to explain anything the second time around. All in all this movie is definitely worth seeing just make sure you have seen the first movie and make sure you are prepared for 2 1/2 hours of pure action!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
You've Gotta Be Kidding Me,"Just watched the movie (better late than never, eh?). Being the sharing kind of guy I am, I wanted to point out a few of my opinions about this train wreck.1) The trademark Michael Bay camera is, as always, all over the place - even in the scenes where there's no action at all! Characters talk about stuff and what does the camera do? It moves around them non-stop! At the end of the movie I felt like I had ridden a bad roller-coaster for too long.2) I enjoy a romantic movie every now and then, especially with a girl next to me. Bu I'm sick to the bone with seeing romantic twists in all kinds of movies. In ROTF our heroes are saving the world from evil robots and they still find the time to have a relationship, complete with arguments, fights, jealousy fits, and all that. What the hell!?3) I have no objection for pretty girls strutting around in movies, but there is a limit to that. Apparently M. Bay doesn't know about this limit. There are way too many half-naked girls in this movie. Especially the dorm Sam moves in looks like the Playboy Mansion more than anywhere else.4) Action movies don't necessarily have strong stories; that being said, this movie's plot manages to insult a 5-year-old's intelligence. They spend $200 million and still can't write a decent story? How hard can it be?5) Of all the stupid things in this movie, there are actually two robots, twins to be precise, who talk and behave like stereotype Afro-American gangbangers. Apart from being extremely insulting to black people, why would robots do that, even if they could? For crying out loud, what is the logic behind this?6) I am aware that history is written by those holding the pen; that being said, I've had enough of watching American propaganda in Hollywood movies. In ROTF, the U.S., once again, saves the world. Americans bravely fight and sacrifice themselves while the rest of the world sits on its butt. U.S. war machines roam the skies, conquer the seas, dominate the land, and as always people from other nations live in mud huts and breed chickens. Get Real!ROTF is a disappointment, through and through. If you like watching endless special effects hour after hour, can listen loud, tuneless action music without having a headache, and have a strong stomach for M. Bay's shaky camera, than go for it. Otherwise avoid it like a pile of nuclear waste.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Holy Crap! 20 year old concept for the modern age,"OK, going into this I was very surprised that a sequel would be made period. Given the people that were hating on this movie, I was scared when I went into the theater; BUT I thought 'it can't be anyworse than ""the hangover"" or ""twilight"". I was surprised in the first 30 minutes that this movie was such a blast, a vast improvement over the original. A thinker of a story, comedy where action was at a null. The trailers are a bit misleading to this movie, they almost give off ""creature awaken from a thousand year old sleep vibe"" but totally goew off a different direction.

"Good, but succumbs to the greatness of the first one...","Upon seeing the film, I read early reviews slamming the film in its entirety. I saw an IMAX showing for this on the opening day, and I was not disappointed with the special effects at all, in fact, the quality and quantity of explosions and crashes and booms and bangs overall in the film was the best thing about it. The rest of the movie, disappointingly, was flawed in every aspect of the film compared to its predecessor, otherwise, it was still a fun ride. In short, its not awful...its just the first one but not nearly as good.First of all, the plot and general writing seemed to have been an identical copy of the first one with a few tweaks. There were the occasional funny and stupid one-liners and the same humor the first one gave. In addition, the number of robots in the film was so immense i walked out not knowing any of their names (save for the ones returning from the first film) and some of which have so little screen time there is no point to seeing them in the film anyway.The general thought i had when I saw this movie was that Bay sought to top number 1 with MORE OF EVERYTHING. He even dragged this one out an additional 20 minutes. Although it seems harmless (as I thought before seeing it), the plot is so minimal there was virtually no point to stretching it out that far. Also, the action scenes were way more animated; however, the editing only nauseates. The scenes had the potential to be excellent, yet this was one factor holding them back.Another argument is the stage-time of the human eye candy in the film (aka Megan Fox). Much of the films emptiness centers around her character. Although she is very HOT, she takes up too much time and overall what she does waste in the film pulls the rest of the movie down.Now for the good things! I did enjoy the action scenes even though some seemed very far-fetched and overlong. The acting was suitable for the film too, and the comic delivery was par with the first film. Overall, there are things to criticize in this movie simply because it didn't match up with the first film, yet it is still a thrill ride and an lots of fun! This is still definitely worth seeing in theaters despite the flaws!",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
So very much wanted to like this film,"As a kid, I was a loyal Transformers fan. I never thought I would see the day when they were brought to live in such a realistic manner as the first film. So naturally, I couldn't wait to see more Transformers from my childhood come to life in this sequel. Quite frankly, the plot was painfully thin, the action scenes, while exciting were waaay too difficult to follow. Virtually none of the new characters were developed beyond mentioning their names. And lastly, Soundwave. The iconic bad guy that most hardcore fans unanimously wanted to see make an appearance. I thought making him a satellite was a great adaptation, but the voice. C'mon man, it was the only thing that made him cool in the cartoon.At the end of the day, Transformers will make box office records, rewarding Hollywood for spoon feeding the masses with more dribble. It's a shame, because the money invested in this film could have gone a lot further. Instead, in order to build off the success of the first film and ramrod a new film into theaters ASAP, the screenplay appears to have been written in the cab ride to the first day of shooting.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
*Sigh* What a pity...,"Transformers had potential to be such a great franchise. I loved it as a kid. It was my favorite cartoon to watch. I had a ton of the action figures. Loved it to death.And then came the movies...Now, I kinda liked the first one. I thought the visuals were really neat, but mostly I just thought it cool that they brought my childhood love to life (Yay, Optimus!). I excused the pitiful plot in the first one. But I should have been able to have had one in this second movie. No. I get nothing. Just another random scrap heap thrown together in a semblance of coherency (and failing pretty hard).It would seem that most of the effort was spent making the visuals, which are quite amazing, I'll admit. And at first I believed that it would be okay just to see for the eye candy aspect (I'd read the horrible reviews before and was sad that it was considered so awful). I hoped for something though and went to see it. There's all this talk about reboots these days. I think Transformers is already in need of one.There is a ""plot,"" but it's just boring and cliché. About 90 percent of the characters are cardboard cutouts and stereotypes. I didn't really feel there were racist robots in the film, though I can understand why some people want to believe it. Most of the humor is vulgar and asinine, the kind that 12 and 13 year old boys make up and repeat to each other over and over again. Halfway through the movie, I was bored, even though there was non-stop action taking place. But it's not even good action. It's chaos and confusion. You can't tell who's who. Some of the new robots weren't even given proper names or lines. I don't have a beef with the acting. I thought it was okay. But it couldn't save this sad beater in need of a date with a car crusher. Also, there was no suspense, no sense of threat or danger, and no emotion evoked where it should have been had.Wait for the DVD if you haven't already seen it. No, I take that back. If you must see it, go now. Seeing it once in the theater is at least cheaper than buying the DVD.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Not as good as the first one but is better then most Hollywood dribble,"I remember not expecting anything good when I walked into the first Transformers movie since I had not liked the animated series, I was not a big fan of Micheal Bay's (Judging from Pearl Harbour and Armarrgedon being terrible) but, since there was nothing else good I went anyway and I was surprised, since it had good special effects (Well I saw THAT coming) and actually had a storyline and I was impressed, it was definitely a step up movie wise for Hollywood/Micheal Bay.Then when I heard about the second movie and I think with my high expectations I was pretty much down there. I expected the same fantastic quality of the first one and while this movie is good, it does not ever reach the quality the first one did.In this one Sam goes off to college 2 years after his first battle with the decepticons. But adventure follows him there and he is led into the second major battle of good vs. evil.The story is alright although lacking in some places, the movie does use its long run time well though and never stops unless it has to. Although the special effects take up this one more, this was not the only problem. They added too many of the characters just for kid humour, something which was lacking in the first one (which is a good thing) and I hated the twins that talked give even though that has not been considered a cool thing to have in a movie in about 5-10 years.Overall, the movie fails to reach up to the standards of the first movie but is pretty good and well worth a watch for fans of the first movie and the show. I rate it 62% for being an entertaining popcorn movie. Nothing more.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The decline of Western civilisation continues.In all seriousness, the spectacularly bloated nature of this film may have a lot to do with the absence of ""supervision"" from Mr Spielberg.

What was the story...?,"I usually enjoy action movies with a good plot and in fact I found the first Transformers fun, fresh and entertaining. This second chapter however has nothing to do with the first, starting from the new ""look"" of Megan Fox, who was so pretty in the first movie, to the silly ""girly"" voice they used in Italy to dub her, continuing with the exaggerated use of special effects to the total detriment of the plot (if there was one in the first place), to the two silly Autobots. Geographically speaking, it seemed like Petra, in Jordan, was near Giza and Luxor (Tebes) in Egypt, while the three locations are hundreds of kilometers away from each other. Also, Giza is right next to the city of Cairo, but in the movie it looked like it was in the middle of the desert... And what about the Egyptian authorities? The final battle was taking place around the pyramids... but there were only a few Jordan helicopters! Just a lot of nonsense... Kind of reminded me of Matrix 2. In my opinion, just an excuse to make money, certainly not good cinema. By the way, where was Spielberg?",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Interesting if you like action, but not much else.","Michael Bay did a great job once again, attracting viewers like flowers attract bees. Unfortunately, Bay thought that if a movie had enough and amazing action, it would be enough for people to love. If you guys like pure action, this is for you. If you like interesting story and character development, find another film.Although its not the best, I don't think it deserves the crap its been getting. This movie is an excellent part 2 for the first one. The special effects were almost unbelievable. It was very fast paced and kept me on the edge of my seat the ENTIRE time. The annoying characters (twin autobots) were a small price to pay for an amazing film. It was well worth the money I paid to see it.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Stupid, Poorly Made and Lame...But Fun","When reviewing a movie like this, one should consider not even bothering. A film with a laughable plot, often horrid dialog, lame jokes, and that tool Shia LeBeouf should be ripped apart a la ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"". However, this does what that joke couldn't do...it entertained.Let's begin by getting the obvious out of the way. The acting (at least the live action and some of the voice over) was reminiscent of an Elementary School production. The storyline was full of clichés and plot holes and meaningless subplots. Some Autobots were barely mentioned or seen and other characters that were prominently featured just seemed to disappear. The acting direction was a joke and those twins reminded me of Amos and Andy (if you get the reference, kudos).That being said, when one goes in to see a movie about giant robots fighting, you can't go in expecting something worthy of the IMDb 250. Many have insulted the defenders of this film by saying that they are ""mindless"" and ""tasteless"" and should know what a good movie is. Sure, this movie was all those, but it was good escapism. I wanted to see epic fight scenes and good explosions, because that's all I trust Bay to do. What movie of his has had ""good"" film-making involved? It's going to be bad, but it's going to be fun. If you want a thought provoking message film, you should stay away. If you want a fun, but stupid, ride, go for it. Try to enjoy a few hours of stupidity and stop over thinking things.Besides, the trailer for ""New Moon"" was more cringe worthy than this whole movie, so it could be worse.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Good, not great, but still loved it","Let's be honest with ourselves - if you're going to see Transformers expecting a stellar plot with well developed characters and stunning dialogue, you're in the wrong place. Going to see Transformers for the movie quality is a bit like going to see Star Wars for the dialogue - you know that you're just going to be disappointed.Yes, the dialogue was weak. Yes, parts of the movie dragged on a bit. I personally thought that there was a distinct disconnect between the first part of the movie (Sam going to college), and the second part of the movie (action scenes). The plot itself was so/so, but in parts was drawn out so much that it got a bit tedious, and tedious and Transformers are words that do not belong in the same sentence.That being said, it was still a fabulous movie. Gorgeous special effects, even better than last time, and loads of new Transformers, which was especially fun. This movie was meant to be entertaining, and entertaining it certainly was. New characters and old characters combined with spectacular special effects were what made this movie worthwhile.So ignore the reviews that decry how terrible this movie is. If you liked the first Transformers, you will like this one. If you thought the first Transformers was swill, this will be swill as well. All in all, a good movie, a good sequel, and well worth going to see for the entertainment of it.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
How is this ranked below DOTM?!!,"Transformers ROTF was a fitting sequel for the successful blockbuster released back in 2007. Unfortunately the numerous problems felt during the sequel production such as the writer's stryke ended up undermining the final result, as the director Michael Bay himself confirmed. The lack of time and/or the short script which Bay had access to may have indeed affected the production process, considering he didn't have that much to work with. Whether those were just excuses for the ""failure"" it doesn't matter. Bay had to adjust the sequel and ended up highlighting the action (as always) bits at the expense of dialogue, character's development etc. Despite Bay's critics concerning the ""mystical"" tone given to the script by the writer's IMO it was what saved the movie and ended up pulling me back to watch it more than once (something that did't happen with the third installment of the franchise). Overall, a decent sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Flash with Little Substance (Warning Major Spoilers ahead),"This movie lacked a clear narrative structure, and was logically inconsistent. The plot point centers around the Fallen getting revenge and firing his weapon. Optimus Prime was a main obstacle to this, but the Deceptagon attack on Optimus was incidental. Then the plot switches to reviving Optimus, and his part in the climax could have easily been a one shot in the opening. In fact the same power to revive Optimus so he could thwart the destruction of Earth was also the source to put Earth in jeopardy to begin with. It would make more logical sense to destroy the matrix right off eliminating the danger. This would prevent Optimus' return, but likely he wouldn't risk the Earth just to be revived. Also Blackbird ended being more instrumental in restoring Optimus.The geographic planning in the movie sucked. Cairo and the Gizz Pyramids are over 200 miles from the tip of the Gulf of Agaba, and Petra is another 100+ miles beyond that. The climax sequences made them seem much closer in relation. Also the Air/Space Museum in DC is in the city limits and does not adjoin a large airfield as alluded to in the movie. Location flaws such as this and bad internal plot logic really emphasize that this movie is flash over substance.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

It is Transformers people.  What do you expect?,"Is it the greatest movie ever? No. Is it a pile of garbage? No.Apparently the majority of people who write reviews and deem themselves God's gift to reviewing movies don't understand how to enjoy a movie ever. I am so tired of reviews that talk about nothing about how horrible the movie was.Complaints I've read:1) There were too many robots. It's transformers. It's supposed to have a lot of robots.2) I went to see it honestly wanting to like it. This is my personal favorite. You went in wanting to like it, but 6 seconds into the movie you found something that ruined the whole movie for you, so you ended up writing 2 full pages about every little thing you didn't like about it. That opening line is nothing more than you trying to pose as someone who is unbiased when you saw this movie when that is clearly not the case.3) Michael Bay is a terrible director. This is the movie that decided that for you? Michael Bay has made better films, but he has made worse ones as well. There is nothing in this movie that is out of character with what he has done in his other films. He makes movies that are meant to be entertaining on a basic level, not win scores of Oscars. Sorry for all you ""purists"" that believe if it's not made by Kubrick, Coppolla, Zwick, Scorcese, Tarantino, etc it's crap. How many of you went in to see this movie expecting it to be ""The Shawshank Redemption""? Learn to enjoy a simple fun movie for what it is.4) I disagreed with where the plot went. Yes, everyone is entitled to their opinion, but simply because it's not what you would have done doesn't mean it's terrible. Unless you are an esteemed screenplay writer yourself this complaint has no validation.5) There is no action until the end. What movie were you watching?I could go on and on, but I'll end there.Here's my bottom line opinion for Transformers 2.It's fun. It's entertaining. Do I like everything about it? No. But I still enjoyed it because I went in with a simple mindset of it's an action movie with awesome special effects a simple story and some humor thrown in. It's not trying to be anything more than that.I will say I wouldn't take my kids to this movie if they're younger than 14. The humor in there along with some of the characters tries to take aim at the younger audience, but comes up short. It is still more of an adult humor with language thrown in.The story is easy to follow and I didn't find myself ever wondering; ""who is that?"" or ""what is going on?"". It is easy to distinguish between the Autobots and Decepticons, so fortunately needless time is not spent on identifying who is who. The story is sufficient for the entertainment level the movie is trying to give. The goal here was not to win an Oscar for the screenplay unlike what a lot of people who have ""reviewed"" this movie seem to think.The special effects are fantastic. This really doesn't need to be said, but I'll say it anyway. The special effects are the heart of this movie. Yes, they're on the screen for most of the movie, but that is to be expected. The effects are the subject matter.Some movies are simply made to entertain and not win awards. This is one of them. If you want it to be fun and just look for the things you like about the movie then you will enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Not as bad as everyone says,"1) Movie length - could have been reduced by 20 mins. For those who are complaining that the movie was too long though, are you the same people who complain that movies are too short? For the price of movies these days, I'm glad someone gave me more than a 90 min movie.2) Special effects and action - they were terrific. At least in this movie, i'm glad he showed some of the robot fight scenes a little more. I felt a little cheated in the first movie.This is definitely not a kids movie. Parents with young kids, I would not recommend. It is overly violent for only a PG-13 rating.3) Character development - we could have used more of Capt Lennox and his team. Felt they were overplayed in the first one but underplayed in the sequel. Folks, we don't need a back story of every single robot who enters the movie. I think the explanation of, ""Prime invited them"" is sufficient enough. Some of them could have been given more of a ""personality"" and we could have used less of mudflaps and skids. would have preferred the trio of motorcycles.4) Story - It's no Oscar winner, but the story holds together better than people would lead you to believe. it's a summer blockbuster, something to pass the days of summer with.

"Perfect for it's audience, everyone else hates it.","Whilst usually I am not a fan of Michael Bay movies, with Pearl Harbour in my opinion being one of the worst films ever made, I have to say I started to think after watching the Transformers films. This was because of two factors: 1) I am an avid fan of the 80's TV show and, a result of this, watching it on the bigger screen was like being a kid again. Especially with Peter Cullen being the voice of Optimus Prime once more. I have to say that whilst the 1986 Transformers movie was much more faithful to the show, the 2007 movie did a damn good job of presenting the concept to a modern audience. I enjoyed the design of the robots (despite HUGE product placement from Chevrolet and Chrysler.) and overall the concept was clever enough and to top it off, it had a kick-ass soundtrack.2) This conditions in which I saw the sequel. It was a perfect summer movie. I saw this film during the day, and then spent the rest of the day partying. It was perfect. Giant robots beating the sh*t out of each other. Could it get any more simpler? To those who criticise the film for having a vague plot, well did you ever watch the 80's TV show? That had no plot what so ever. It was dumb, loud and colourful (aside from the Decepticons). In other words, perfect for it's target audience. It was the same for this film. It provided a basic set of rules for people to follow. Good and bad robots. Fight. Explosion. Done. $800 million big ones.One common complaint about this film is that it is a typical 'Michael Bay' movie. By this I mean it has all the classic trademarks, poor direction, explosions (oh so many explosions) weak plot lines and poor character development. Although this is a valid complaint, I felt it worked for this movie. Bravo for putting Transformers in the hands of the most crazy director in Hollywood. Having so many explosions and action scenes mean that I was never bored. And those moments when there was no action. Bay throws in Miss Fox to entertain the male half of the audience.Although it may seem stupid and insulting to women. It is important to note that Michael Bay clearly knows his audience and so panders to them. He knew that the average summer movie goer wants to see some action, listen to some awesome music (provided by Linkin Park) and watch Megan Fox fixing motorcycles whilst bent over. I have to say that for 90% of the time men are respectful to women. But when your watching a film for escapism you just want to no be judged for thinking a certain way, you enjoy being free of judgement.In conclusion, you can either love or hate this film. Love it if your in the right mindset and like simply being entertained. Or you can complain. Pick this movie to death because it that's truly what you want to do. In the time you do that, I'll watch Transformers 2 and love all the way through.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Revenge of the Brain-Dead Summer Movie,"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009)1/2 (out of 4)Who ever knew that $200-million could make for such an ugly piece of junk? Michael Bay's sequel to his 2007 mega-hit features Shia LaBeouf as Sam Witwicky, who this time is heading off to college leaving his girlfriend (Megan Fox) back at home. While at college Sam begins seeing cryptic symbols and soon the Decepticons are coming after him. TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN is an incredibly stupid, loud, obnoxious and rather worthless picture that perfectly shows what's so wrong with Hollywood today. Why on Earth would someone green light a picture like this and why on Earth would someone like Steven Spielberg not ask for a re-write of the screenplay? I understand this is a summer blockbuster so the ""story"" isn't the most important thing but what we have here has to be one of the worst written screenplays in the history of cinema and I still can't get over how someone wouldn't at least try to fix some of the various problems going on. Just take a look at how poorly written all of the human characters are. It really seems as if they're in some sort of bad sitcom because we get some of the most obnoxious scenes you're ever going to witness and what makes them so painful to watch is how unfunny they are. Take a look at the scene where Sam is getting dropped off at college and his parents embarrass him but it gets even worse when the mother eats some hash brownies and goes crazy on campus. Give me a break. Did someone in the script stages actually think this was funny? The dialogue going back and forth between the characters are just brain-numbing bad because it really does come off as if they don't know what they're talking about and just making up words and putting them together without any thought. A Bay film usually at least delivers on the action but even these scenes are rather boring here. Once again there are a lot of explosions, loud noises and of course things going boom but all of them are rather ugly and poor looking. I think it's obvious that most of the $200-million budget went towards the CGI effects but I found all of them to be quite poor, which is rather shocking considering how good they looked in the first picture. TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN is a really, really bad movie on all levels but how it got to the shooting stages is beyond me.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I know their target audience were boys that age 10-15, but if you don't want to heed the warning on the rating then don't complain about the swearing and sexual themes. And lastly the movie was way too long. If I want to watch two and a half hours of explosions and story remnants I'll buy or rent an extended version of the film. You didn't see the whole Lord of the Rings movies in the theater they all got extended through the DVD release. So long story short..he-he..they should have shortened it, then extended it upon DVD release. So to sum it all up; OK storyline, cut down on explosions, if you're going to take kids to see this be prepared to take whatever comes your way, and two and a half hours of explosions and a mediocre storyline shouldn't release until DVD.

"Bigger, louder, not necessarily better","Prior to Transformers (and, to a certain degree, The Island), Michael Bay seemed destined to be remembered as the director of a string of mindless, loud, critically lambasted blockbusters, plus Pearl Harbor (which was all of the above, only a lot more). Now, he's announced he won't direct the already announced Transformers 3, preferring to focus on smaller projects, and so he leaves the franchise with a sequel that looks scarily similar to his previous movies: dumb, excessive and (at least in the US) despised by critics. Sure, it is all of those things, but there's a big difference between Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen and, say, Armageddon: this time, the good parts manage to largely outweigh the missteps.Plot-wise, the Kurtzman-Orci duo (aided by Transformers expert Ehren Kruger) aims to set up a complex mythology, as is to be expected with action and sci-fi sequels nowadays: the Fallen mentioned in the title isn't just an adjective related to the defeated Decepticons, it's also the name of a god-like Transformer (voiced by Tony ""Candyman"" Todd) who's up to no good and has been around for a long time. At about the same time as he decides to make his move, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is about to start college and trying to keep his relationship with Mikaela (Megan Fox) alive, but realizes the war between Autobots and Decepticons isn't over as far as he's concerned when he starts having spooky visions that could be of interest for the Fallen and the newly resurrected Megatron (Hugo Weaving). And so it's time for Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen), Bumblebee, Ironhide and the other 'bots to help save the world. Again.The first Transformers succeeded because it displayed a foolproof mix of action and humor, barring the final battle which was a bit OTT. It was a silly movie that was perfectly aware of its own silliness and turned that characteristic into an asset. And for about 90 minutes, it seems like Bay and the writers got that balance right the second time as well: one moment Optimus and Megatron kick the mechanical crap out of each other, the next Sam is trying to make sure his parents don't embarrass him or goofing around with John Turturro's disgraced - and shamefully underused - CIA agent (""What you're about to see is classified. Do not tell my mother.""). The laughs don't just come from the spot-on humans (Rainn Wilson's cameo is a blast), they come from the robots as well, as new entry Jetfire (Mark Ryan) eloquently (more or less) proves.Then, all of a sudden, Bay drops the restraint in the third act: buildings blow up incessantly, slow-motion, smoke and dust are overused, the big Transformer battle goes on for ever and EVER, the mythology leaves room for every cliché in the manual and the silliness is blown way out of proportion (a close-up of a Decepticon's ""privates""? Really?). One might also wonder why the director bothered casting the animated series' original voice cast for the new robots (Ravage, Devastator, etc) when said machines are hastily introduced and then swiftly disposed (speaking of which, why come up with a Decepticon that looks human and drop the subplot after five minutes?).And yet... and yet Revenge of the Fallen is a pretty decent piece of entertainment. Yes, it's loud and dumb in all the wrong ways past the 90-minute mark, and yes, Bay is obviously pandering to a certain audience's expectations by inserting clearly gratuitous slow-mo shots of Megan Fox running in a quite revealing outfit, but what the hell, he does all that with much more gusto, energy and willingness to amuse than he did in Pearl Harbor. If this truly is his last big movie (for the time being, at least), it is, in its own, weird way, a triumph.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

More of the same. Except its just the same. Just more of it.,"Bigger is better; that's what Hollywood and the Michael Bay team believes. They believe that if you hurl everything from the first film, enhance it a gajabazillion times, and then enhance it even more, you'll have a better film. This mathematical formula has been used for action blockbusters since the early 80s when Empire Strikes Back unleashed its sequelness for the world to see. However, for years, we critics (and moviegoers) have shouted back: ""Check the math!!!"" Well, we don't really actually say that, but sometimes more of something is too much of something---get what I am saying? Let's simplify: Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is basically the original film except louder, longer, more stereotypical, and even more anti-climactic. All the strengths and flaws from the original transform their way into the sequel, and the end result is another Michael Bay firestorm of explosions (you know the kind, in which there are explosions inside explosions).In Transformers 1 ½ (my interpretation, my title) we follow Sam as he heads off to college. But, trouble is brewing as a source of unspeakable energy is being hunted by the enemy (that sounds awfully familiar). Before you know it, evil transformers are everywhere, and our heroes see themselves being overwhelmed by the enemy and also by the United States whom is finding Prime and his followers more a burden than helpful. 8 million dollar script gets you a repeat of the original script, with more dialogue and more backstory. Call me crazy, but in a franchise known for the fights and the awesome robots, do we really need deep conversations about relationships? Roberto Orci (writer of Star Trek and several episodes of Alias) should know better. The other writers, well, their (Ehren Kruger and Alex Kurtzman) previous work wasn't as impressive.More. More is the recurring theme to this film. More transformers, more characters, more action, more talking, more exploding, more music, more comic relief, more build-up, more fights, more close-ups, more special effects, more scenery, more military vehicles and weaponry, more stereotypes, more danger, more deaths, and to top it all off, more animal humping. There was more Megan Fox showing off her body instead of her acting. There was more from the parents (Kevin Dunn and Julie White), as they throw in more sexual humor and a surprising bit of drug-related humor as well. The parents was actually one of the better portions of the movie, as they provided the best comic relief; much better than the hoards of transformers whose only job was to attempt to make the audience laugh.In a film that has more, there are surprisingly less of other elements. There was less Optimus Prime than the original, there was actually less robot-on-robot fighting, as more of the action sequences involved the military going at it against the robots (Funny how we only see the United States military in the entire movie despite the fact that the fighting took place in two other countries). Michael Bay cannot deny he loves the military and the weaponry brought, since this film could have passed off as an Army recruitment video describing and showing just what the United States army is capable of. Bay himself dons the same directing techniques as all his other films; the man is coming off as a one-trick pony.Despite all the setbacks, you will see this film for one main reason: the special effects. The special effects team yet again delivers some of the best work in history, as the transformers themselves look absolutely fantastic and full of detail. The special effects never drop from prime quality, and is the main strength in the entire film. The fights themselves do improve, as the scope and range allow us to accurately see who is fighting whom. Unfortunately, the third act is where almost all the intense and gigantic action is, as the previous two acts had little blurbs of action. What hampers Transformers 1 ½ even more is that like in the original, the final battle (and the ending itself) is extremely anti-climactic. When the main and grand finale does appear, you are already tired from all the build-up that happened for about 45 minutes. There just wasn't enough activity coming from our robotic heroes, all the focus was on the military.Bottom Line: Am I being too harsh to a blockbuster flick? Most people would say so but guess what, summer action blockbusters can be noisy, explosive, and smart at the same time. This has been proved with the likes of Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Last Crusade, True Lies, Speed, Pirates of the Caribbean, Terminator 2, and even Michael Bay's very own The Rock. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen will satisfy the action junkies loosely, but only if they are willing to accept all the drawbacks, especially that of the franchise changing from robots vs. robots to man vs. robots. 150 minutes, several stereotypes, hundreds of explosions, and a couple dues ex mahcinas later, a weak sequel arrives.The ironic thing is I grade this film the same as the original. So, more does not equal better in this case, and more does not equal worse either. It just means, more of the same, and it's the same sort of stuff that prevents this franchise from ever being halfway-decent.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fantastic Entertainment for Entertainment Lovers,"Out of all of the movies due to come out this summer. This one and G.I. Joe are the ones that I decided to make it a point to see on the day of release and even reserve my seat well in advance to feel like I'm right smack in the middle of it.This Transformers, compared to the first one, was geared a lot more towards action and less storyline kind of like Matrix 2 compared to 1. A lot of reviewers are griping about Megan Fox's weak acting but I didn't go into the movie expecting Oscar-worthy performances. I came into this one expecting to be entertained.The Special Effects in this one are mind-blowing. When I left the theater I was still in awe on how long we have come in the movie World with visual effects. I just think about the geniuses that it takes to put a movie like this together.I also enjoyed the comedy in the movie. John Turturro was a perfect addition to the movie and he was funny every step of the way. I like the twin robots speaking like some Mid-90s hip-hip MC's. The parents are hilarious too.I am giving this movie a 9/10. It gets a 10/10 on an entertainment level but the 9/10 is for the storyline and a little confusion here and there.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Enjoyable but could and SHOULD have been better!,I've just returned home from seeing the sequel to the awesome Transformers. Unfortunately it hasn't lived up to the hype for me as somewhere between the first and this they have forgotten their target audience.It was disappointing for a few reasons:1. There were several characters in this film that were clearly aimed for a much younger audience than the M15+ suggests. Whoever was responsible for the two 'brothers' who talk like they are in a Disney film should be taken outback and shot!! It RUINED the film as I found it impossible to become immersed in the story whenever they were in a scene.2. One of the aspects of the first film that I loved was the dialogue used by the Decepticons which would be translated at the bottom of the screen. This was absent in the sequel which I found rather disappointing.3. The degree of difficulty to kill an autobot/decepticon changed. In Transformers it required a massive effort to destroy one of these guys and suddenly it became much easier.Things I liked:1. The acting was really quite good in my opinion. Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox were as good if not better than in the prequel.2. The special effects were brilliant. Loved every minute of the action and was exactly what I had hoped for.Overall it was a good film but had the potential to be great. I find it hard to understand why this film is only half a vote behind its prequel when they are miles apart.,7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
my boyfriend's money was wasted on this....,"This movie was horrible. It was a waste of money, & I suggest people not to go see it. I thought it was very pointless. The first one was very good, but this one was horrible. There was a lot of crude humor, sexuality, and i was appalled by everything they did to destroy this movie. At first, it seemed kinda cool. The opening and everything. But barely into the movie, you see some stupid dogs humping each other, twice in like 5 minutes..which is pointless anyways, and has nothing to do with the whole Transformers thing, and then we see girls in college, and they show all of the ""beautiful"" ones with cleavage and nice bodies, just like the media wants you to believe. It's eye candy for many guys, and probably made many girls, including me, feel horrible, and makes us feel worse about ourselves, because of how ""perfect"" the girls seem, especially Megan Fox, and how much we would like to look like her. The movie shows off her body, closes up on her lips, and there are scenes of a ""beautiful"" girl trying everything to seduce Sam, she suggestively pushes a chair into something and sits on his lap, and then you see her later, get on top of Sam, until you see a tail come out, showing her underwear. Obviously, I could tell from the beginning that something was wrong with her. Anyways, getting off subject... another thing that bothered me and my boyfriend, is how the Autobots would bleed blood, and they would be torn apart as if they had guts. Omg, robots are not supposed to bleed! I mean, cmon. And so many things were just thrown in there unnecesarily. I mean, if guys like this movie because of the sexy girls, the party scenes, the crude humor, and the sensuality, you guys can go buy some porn or something instead. But don't waste your money on this. This is supposed to be about robots, not skanky, suggestive girls, and stupid explosions, and no plot.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pearl Harbour: Revenge of the Fallen,"Oh yes my friends. Never has a movie been soo long, had soo many special effects, been soo expensive, been soo hammy and been soo utterly utterly rubbish. Not since Pearl Harbour.If this film had been 70,80,90 minutes, maybe I could see the fun side of having robots shoot at other robots, as well as Megan Fox's anatomy in gratuitous slow motion without any discernible hint of a plot or acting talent. But oh no. This weighs in at over 2 hours. I was literally in slack jawed amazement it was still going on 120 minutes in.This movie was definitely aimed at the under 12s. If you enjoyed this movie you probably fell asleep till 10 minutes before the end, or have been recently lobotomised.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"The money is all up there on the screen, but not a lot else","There is one thing that you can almost always say about the blockbuster films of Michael Bay and his ilk, and that is that the money is very clearly up there on the screen. The money is there in terms of the locations, the expensive sets, the destruction of those expensive sets and of course the many robots who do always feel like they are really ""in"" the scene with the real aspects. In terms of all this the film is impressive and if you go into the film wondering how on earth anyone could spend so much money making a two hour film then you will leave the cinema with your question answered because it is all right there.Unfortunately there is not much else there with it and indeed many of the problems with the film (and unsurprisingly there are many) cannot be addressed by simply having a lot of money in your hand to throw at it. The plot is the most immediate problem, partly because you have to keep the two human characters central to it whether it makes sense to do so or not. As a result we get a reasonable idea that is stretched too thin and loaded with convenience into a narrative that really never does anything other than provide the most basic of frames for stuff blowing up. The problem is that, because it is so contrived and basic, the viewer never really cares about the story but yet still has to sit through many clunky scenes where the characters explain to one another what is going on and why they are now going somewhere else to blow stuff up. Needless to say that the same writers struggling with this are not able to make much of the characters either. This conspires to undermine the one selling point of the film – the action. Without me caring one bit about the proceedings, the action becomes nothing more than special effects. My heartbeat never increased and my palms never got sweaty because there is no tension, danger, thrill or reason to have any emotional investment in the film whatsoever.The writing produces the most painful problem as well, which is the lame and ill-fitting attempts at comedy. While watching it I thought to myself ""Will Smith"" does this very well"" because the mixing of comedy with the action of big summer blockbusters is something he is called upon to do very often (I know it is not just him involved in making this work). However here the comedy is poor and it sits really badly alongside the action scenes because the humour is not part of the film so much as an aspect that is inserted in specific scenes. I say this because the film is not ""fun"" in the way good blockbusters can be but rather it feels like boxes were ticked without any intention of whether the various elements fitted together or not. The low points are generally associated with two of the Transformers who have clearly been scripted in a meeting that involved the word ""urban"" being used a lot. Mudflap & Skids are essentially urban stereotypes and I suspect that the people who wrote them probably think that Jar-Jar Binks is a great character as well. At best they are annoying and unfunny; at worst they are offensive race-related stereotypes.The cast (real and unreal) add to the film's problems although I will acknowledge that the cast don't have a lot to work with when you consider some of the lines they have to deliver and things they have to do. Having said that though, it doesn't help that the film is led by two ""stars"" who we are told are the new big things but who still leave me wondering why on earth they get all this buzz around them. LaBeouf doesn't have the charisma to lead this film and he doesn't really work in comedy, action or romance. OK he jumps around a lot but that's about it – his material is awful at times and it does feel like he just ""went with it"". Fox's role is a lot easier. As with the promotion of the film at various premieres (Fox front and centre, posing for the many press), the film pushes her body to the fore – her first scene has her repeating her ""bent over"" pose from the first film, this time over a motorbike. Personally I don't really see it and am not sure why she is famous while countless equally attractive women have yet to get a breakthrough –outside of her body there doesn't appear to be much else that makes her noteworthy. Oh, and if she is going to continue working her body in action movies, someone needs to buy her a decent sports bra or she find her assets ""depreciating"" the more ""running from explosion"" scenes she does. Turturro doesn't escape the rot but at least he is a bit of fun and even though he is so-so he steals every scene he is in – easy considering he shares some with the annoying Rodriguez. Duhamel and Tyrese do the same as last time with little to offer. The voice work is all very gravelly and fine with OK turns from Weaving, Cullen, Todd and others but Wilson and Kenny should be ashamed – blackface is unacceptable even when if one is a black actor ""wearing"" it.Transformers 2 is noisy and expensive but offers no more than this. A lot of the problems come with the territory but they have the knock-on effect of leaving the viewer apathetic to the action and ultimately I found it dull and unengaging which is probably its single biggest failing. Might satisfy those just looking for noise and colour but offers little else for anyone else.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Special F/X plus Megan Fox balance out awful script.,"Look, they pushed this out to capitalize on the success of the first movie and it shows in the script and story (if you can call it that).It's not that the plot is incomprehensible, it's just that it doesn't mean anything or amount to anything. Anybody looking for more mythology into cybertron, origins of Autobots or decepticons will be sorely disappointed. Then again, anybody with half a brain can figure out that Michael Bay has never been, nor ever will be interested in aspects of film-making that actually add depth to a story. The movie is 2+ hours of explosions, gunfire, and violence interspersed with pitiful attempts at humor.That being said, the special f/x in this movie are without question some of the best I have ever seen, the pyrotechnics, the CGI, the choreographed battle sequences are first rate, the movie delivers the punch in that department. In the end, it's about what I expected.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Action, explosions, entertainment and then 12 year old humor for some reason","This movie would have been a 9/10 except for all the dumb potty humor.

But this just ate my soul and it wasn't Bay who did it. Some stupid focus group out there said they needed to appeal to the kids 15 and under after all it is a kids movie right...bullpoopy I say. 2 moronic stereo types (why not put them in black face and be done with it), Old man jokes shesh kids these days, childish sexuality and potty humor, honestly what the F was this doing here (look balls hahaha... blah).

"Michael Bay makes a serviceable film. Dumb, but fun.","Michael Bay.Has any other name been as synonymous with big Hollywood productions besides Jerry Bruckheimer? He has been known for his legendary special effects as well as his utter lack of human traits in a film. If there was ever a classic example of preferring style over substance, look no further than Bay himself.Thus, imagine the surprise many felt when they actually admitted to liking Bay's Transformers. While his critics were still present, he had actually received several praises from several thousand fan boys and was green-lit to do a sequel.The plot starts off much later after the initial Decepticon encounter. Literally. Apparently at 17,000 B.C., there were also giant robots raging war with our ancestors. In the present, however, the U.S. military and the Autobots combine together to form NEST, a secret force made in order to defeat incoming Decepticons. However, after a messy battle, the military has had it. They want the Autobots to either cooperate or leave. Elsewhere, Sam Witwicky (Shia Lebeouf), leaves for college and tries to have a 'normal' life. Of course, when he accidentally touches a cube fragment, he sees symbols, thus destroying his wishes altogether.To be honest, with the exception of the giant opening battle, I found the First Act a bit of a bore. It's ironic because in the first Transformers, I found the First Act the strongest. It really had a sort of human connection with me that struck me the right way. However here, it has all these messy subplots which I didn't really care about. Like Sam's relationship problems, for example. It's the typical long distance troubles and new hot girl that really didn't interest me. I also didn't particularly care for the in-fighting of the Autobots vs. the U.S. Government. It's sort of that expected feeling you get from a sequel.Luckily, the rest of the movie follows up to what passes for an entertaining popcorn movie.All the vices of Bay's film work are here: the shaky camera, the 360 camera, the explosions, the loud noises, the heavy editing and of course, boyish humor. And just like the last Transformers, Bay always had to refer to one of his earlier works.What really brings the movie out are its actors. While the characters they play are a bit bland, they are given a lot of screen time and a lot of situations to express their acting range. Shia Lebeouf is as strong as ever as well as Peter Cullen as the infamous Optimus Prime. John Tanaturo is hilarious again, but credit should go to newcomer Ramon Rodriguez as Sam's roommate, Leo. He has some bright charm to him that compliments Shia's acting.The robots in the film are given a similar treatment in the first film. While Bumblebee and Optimus are given sufficient screen time, the rest of the Autobots don't really have that luxury. Add in the fact, that there are even more Autobots than prior, and you have a problem.An odd note I'd like to comment on is the Megatron/Starscream interaction. In the original cartoon, Starscream made it no secret that he wanted to overthrow Megatron and lead the Decepticons. Hell, he even tried to kill Megatron a couple of times. But in the movie, Starscreams kind of a coward, and begs at Megatron's feet. I kind of wished that Starscream would've back stabbed him, but oh well.The action of the movie is intense. If you ever find yourself lacking a reason to go see a film, just go for pure eye-candy alone. The battles are on a large scale, and bigger than ever. Contrary to what a lot of people said, I could keep track with all the action on the screen. Perhaps it was the color scheme, but I found myself engaged with a lot of the battles, and knew who was winning and who was losing.The humor is questionable to say the least. A large part of the movie is comedy and it comes from all directions. From speech to slapstick, there's humor to be found everywhere. Some of it works, such as slapstick from Rodrigez's part. Some of it is crass, like a robot dry humping Megan Fox. And some is just plain painful. There are two robots who are twins. Whether they are offensive Mexican Stereotypes or Black Stereotypes, doesn't matter to me. I just want them gone.In the end, you go in hating this film, you'll hate this film. If you go in liking this film, you'll like it. It's just another one of Bay's works that will appeal to a certain audience. The plot is serviceable enough, though with plenty of holes, to get us through and there are good moments as well as painful moments. In the end, I liked it just fine.Verdict: Go see it.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of those epic action movies,"Long anticipation for this sequel is paid off. This movie is seriously epic if you love action. People are always complaining about plots and the humors put into the movie. Seriously if you expect to get interesting plot, don't watch this. This is purely action movie on its base, you can go watch The Dark Knight or Eagleeye if you want interesting plot. The length 2 and a half hours have tons of action and the battles really pull you into the movie. The comedies also acceptable, at least the whole cinema laughed when they're shown. I really don't understand why people complaining with the amount of explosions. What are expected when missiles are shot? Fireworks? You hit robots with tanks and you expect water splash? Explosions are there because they all are using weapons!!There are some weaknesses as well, nothing is perfect anyway. Some characters are being different compared to the previous. Some parts of the movie are weird without clear explanation of their background. The battles are fast paced and hard to differ between Autobots and Decepticons. But they are not big deals since the actions can cover those weaknesses.If you want to see full packed action movie and getting entertained on your weekend, I recommend to watch this movie. If you want to see movie with interesting plot, then forget it, you won't get it in this movie.For action based movie, I would give it 9/10 Two thumbs up!!",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
this movie was bad ass,"I was totally blown away from this movie. It was longer and better than the first one. I have no idea where these people are coming up with these bad reviews. I never go see movies on opening weekend but I just felt compelled to see this one on Friday night. We waited over an hour in line. It was worth every minute. We absolutely LOVED IT. There was so much more fighting in this movie and finally bumblebee kicks ass! There was so much more US and foreign military interaction involved, it was awesome! I'm probably going to go see it again, which I've never done for any movie. I liked it just as much as the first one, probably a little better. They finally used a little more adult language and some of the humor was more adult oriented which was great! The graphics were unbelievable and they left the door open for a 3rd installment.

This was what hit the fan,"For starters, the plot was so darn idiotic that you spend the half movie trying to make sense of the plot until you finally realize that there is no point. Its like an acid-trip with two Mexican strippers and a bag of bubblegum, just ridiculous.Really makes you wonder who is responsible to give a retarded man this much money to throw in the ocean (make this movie).The scenes that I believe was supposed to be romantic was so sadly produced and acted that you rather than feeling for the characters actually felt for the actors and their careers.A few times during this two and a half hour endurance test you actually found yourself thinking that the director must be joking, but sadly he didn't..",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I think I threw-up in my mouth a little...,"At around 30-40 minutes into this movie you realize its going to be one of the worst movies you'll ever see on a big screen. And then you cringe to think you still have another 2 hours left.The amount of sexual content makes me want to punch myself in the face. What a disgrace to Transformers to rely so heavily on insignificant dribble. Sex may sell, but this was ridiculous: Robot ""parts"" coming out of a woman's panties, a transformer humping the leg of Megan Fox, and balls dangling from another transformer. Sadly, I could go on. What an outcry for attention and blatant distraction to the absolute lack of a plot.The amount of time spent on lame and unnecessary content causes a pathetic lack of character development and insight. ALL characters were COMPLETELY one-dimensional and some even extremely stereotypical. Sadly, not even the special effects made up for all this: The further the movie progressed, the more confusing the fight scenes since all the Transformers began looking alike.The movie gave me a sense that it was much, much more about Megan Fox's assets than about Transformers. And no gentleman, not in a good way... in a highly annoying, pathetic and nauseating way.Easily one of the worst movies I've ever come across. Please, Michael Bay, for the love of God....retire.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Amazing movie if only slightly flawed,"Let me start out by saying: Wow. Just... wow. The action in this movie is amazing. The plot for the most part stood on it's own, but let's be honest: you're here to see robots kick the crap out of each other. Transformers 2 delivers this by the truckload (no pun intended.) The fight scenes were incredible, to the point where I turned to my girlfriend at least 20 times to say ""This is badass!"" The action was nothing short of breathtaking, and I love the fact that the Autobots could actually hold their own this time (no more 3 Autobots and the Army struggling against a single Decepticon here). However, there were a few cheesy moments, clichéd characters, lame one-liners that I felt detracted from the movie. And the ending was not satisfying at all. I don't want to give too much away, but I will say that it felt too ""easy"". It felt like the writer got lazy and just wanted to finish it.Minor flaws aside, I loved this movie, and will be seeing it again, then buying the DVD and watching it again. The fight scenes were AMAZING, and for a popcorn flick it definitely hits more than it misses. See this movie!!Edit: After reading a lot of the comments and seeing the negative ones, I kind of get the feeling that a lot of people were a) expecting Transformers 2 to be the next Shawshank Redemption or b) just plain hate Michael Bay and therefore anything he does. This was SUPPOSED to be mindless and over the top. I'm not a fanboy, you're entitled to your own opinion, but when someone compares Transformers 2 to Goodfellas, it's clear that some people just love to hate this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Bigger, better and longer.","Grab your shades and prepare for the lens flares!I'm a sci-fi fan, but never really got into Transformers until I saw the 2007 film. I thought it had some cool moments in it and I did enjoy it, but thought that the movie had a little too much out of place comedy and that their coverage of many of the robot fights wasn't too hot.In Revenge of the Fallen, Bay's moved on from showcasing intensely blurry closeups of Optimus Prime's ankle to providing proper titanic scale battles that aren't covered using MTV's camera crew. The level of action really blew me away and I was quite impressed with the visual effects which I thought were way beyond what they were able to do in the first film. Granted there's a good deal of human drama in there too, done in Michael Bay's typical cheesified style. It's fun to watch, the new ""girl"" providing a nice twist to the standard love triangle idea.Revealing the ancient history of the autobots and decepticons further was interesting and even if they were a bit nauseating at times, I liked the hyperactive minibots that they brought in. My only problems were the runtime, which was a bit excessive, and the lack of characterization with the Fallen guy.Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed the film and think it's got the energy and feeling of excitement that the first one lacked a little. It feels more like a proper film than an overly long montage, and thrilled me much more than Terminator 4 ever could. Definitely recommended for all action and sci-fi fans out there!",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
worse than expected,"Yes, it's a Michael Bay film and so to expect anything else than lots of explosions, special effects, cultural ignorance, borderline racism and a big military showreel would be hypocritical. And I'm not going to criticise the plot either, because, clearly the film was not intended to have one. There is just enough dialoge to stitch the various battle scenes together and that's it. Continuity comes down to keeping the same characters throughout the film and having them say variations of their four or five different lines over and over again, and you know what, its fine, because the film doesn't try to be more than that. After all, this is a life action version of a cheap cartoon show inspired by a toy commercial. Hey, Michael Bay would have been my first choice too!I was getting annoyed by the frequent use of words like ""destiny"" and ""purpose"" and all that, but its not Transformer's fault. Every second Hollywood movie has it by now and I was already tired of it by the time Matrix Reloaded came out.There is some true potential for comedy here, snappy, fast shot dialogue, and little side stories that are cut together and overlaid in a very fast and exciting fashion. Typical for Michael Bay and something that worked well in movies like Bad Boys II. Too bad they all boil down to some character bumping her head or something, oh well.What I was expecting were stunning visual effects and a big, thoroughly directed action spectacle and in that respect I felt rather disappointed. Don't get me wrong, I have to give Bay credit for being able to insert an action driven sequence in five minute intervals, and I'm not being cynical! If you love big explosions, there are few films that can reach this sort of action density.It's fun, but it's also way too uniform. From the first opening battle with some huge unicycle robot to the last fight in the desert there is little or no dramatisation, no structure to keep me interested.For instance, the robot's agility and strength are in no comparison to the little human soldiers with their petty machineguns, so having humans fight robots for more than 20 minutes without them getting ripped into little fleshy pieces just seems odd and therefore drains a lot of suspense out of the action.The Explosions are repetitive and especially the final battle seemed to go on forever. The camera feels detached and inconsistent, which is sad because some sequences had some really great camera work in them but they are short moments and are easy to miss.Even the visual effects on the robots weren't all that impressive. I would have actually liked to see some robots TRANSFORM but even that wasn't possible most of the time. I'm sure a lot of effort has been put in building and animating these characters but apart from two or three scenes none of the transformations can actually be seen!!?! Either the camera swoops around so there's too much motion blur, or it's just a close-up where you can only see some random metal parts fly by, or the shot is cut early, or the transformation is actually purposely hidden behind some cleverly placed obstacle (parachute!!!).Kudos to the production team, it's a technical masterpiece. Still, despite all the effort, it left me somewhat unsatisfied. I rate it 3 out of ten because, sadly, it's not what I'd consider a great action film. Transformers 3 will probably be better than this but I won't be going.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Michael Bay. All action... No story.,"I'm not a big fan of Michael Bay at all. He seems to concentrate more on the action of the movie and less about story and character development. That might be good for some of you, but for the rest of us... Transformers 2 was Michael Bay at his best. All action and no story or character development. I must admit, I loved the first film and thought to myself, wow, maybe Mr. Bay is beginning to grow up. Nope. I was wrong. He butchered the Transformers franchise. The autobots that were in the first film really never had any kind of character development in this film. Most of the film they were missing. The movie was too long. A lot of the going to college scenes could have been cut out. They were irrelevant to the story. The fight scenes between the transformers were hard to follow because most of them were the same colors. Prime and Bumblebee were my favorites. A plus to the movie was the effects. They were great and really deserve to be nominated for an Oscar. You can tell they put a lot of effort into them. The beginning of the film was better then the second half. Still, go see the film. It's worth a watch. Just go to the bathroom before you see it. I made that mistake.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Don't even worry about reading any spoilers because you'll see it all coming anyway. I nearly fell asleep and left shaking my head as I realized I was theoldest one in the theater.

As expected and just as AMAZING!!!,"After watching this film I realized I got exactly what I expected. Bay gave me sex appeal, he gave me hard rock music, and he gave me intense action, and oh boy was it magnificent. This isn't a psychological thriller or some tear jerker. This is the kick-ass movie you go into knowing exactly what to expect, and yet again I was anything but disappointed!!! The Autobots are just as hysterical and charismatic as in the first movie, and the deceptacons are more evil than ever.Movies like these do their job perfectly. They let you enter into a state of imagination where the impossible becomes possible and the stressful becomes enjoyable. Once again Bay's mixture of special effects and not overly used CGI meshes perfectly well together.I'd like to say thank you to Michael Bay for creating enjoyment twice in a row, something many directors can't do. I'd also like to say amazing job, in the behind the scenes sense, to such producers as Lorenzo DI Bonaventura and Mark Vahradian for helping put such a great film together.

Great movie,"1st of all for all you people that say all the movie is, is robot 1at of all it is called transformers so maybe before you write a review you should learn how to read.

For all of you that hate the camera work, maybe you should try directing a movie then you can criticize Micheal bay until then shut your mouth.

Everyone else I have talked to has at the very least liked the movie. It just goes to show how bad you guys are at probably the most unskilled job in the world; o obviously it was a bad movie right no wrong how much money did it make why don't you check.

BUT, that does not mean i didn't enjoy it. it had exactly what i expected. i saw it in imax and it delivered outstanding special effects and visual quality, extremely loud and CLEAR not distorted audio that made you feel every autobots footstep in depths of your chest. over all i thought it was a good movie. very entertaining, and isn't that what a movie is all about?",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Michael Bay is good for teenage films !,"I was in the 2nd year of College when this was released and so could relate very well with all its sci-fi fantastical contents. From childhood onwards I have seen a lot of Michael Bay's films and almost all of his films carry the same tone, the tone of teenage spirit, the exciting rushness of doing this or that plus the teenage aspirations. Transformers 2 is also no exception. The only difference between this film and his rest is that of the topic chosen. This time the topic chosen is technology, yes electronics to be specific. All throughout the movie it depicted more or less the obsessive traits for electronics generally seen among teenagers. The statement 'If God created us then who created them ? ' in somewhere reflects well about it. The creator is ofcourse Hollywood or Michael Bay and his crew. When all these passion for electronics combines with the extra terrestrials, imagine the heat of restlessness, not to mention about Bay's likewise much needed intellectual cinematographic appraisals, action cuts and splendid visuals.Transformers 2 is a well thought out plan as a sequel, where exciting level is at a high zone, characters all been possessed by the younger traits, reflecting their thirst for genius attitude, lacks the serenity because of sudden appearance of wisdom oriented science in one of the most beautiful and happiest places of USA. Bay didn't stay confined in it rather included the wonders of the world like the great Pyramid, the place where spirituality is preferred higher than technology, at least in modern times. In climax all these creative aspects of High scientific truth, religio-political scenario, the wonderous landscapes with ancient myths fuses into one in the desert where Bay even remembered to point the resurrection concept. The seriousness within the film in some scenes well reflected seriousness but most are not like that, rather are funny. Only Autobots and Decepticons are serious in the film, nevertheless the film has strong logics behind all the tiny situations going around. But a few has flaws like Sam entering the security of Egyptians police etc, whichyou better ignore to enjoy the film.Technically the film is awesome, impresssive camera works, stunning romance and action, with BGM at an average. The performance of Shia la beouf is enough to entertain you, atleast I would say he saved the spirit of the film. My most favourite funny scene is that of where one character says 'A place of peace, - Shut up Grandma', and serious stuff like transformation into futuristic gadgets. For an entertaining film like this, I have written the review a bit seriously but you don't need to be serious, neither you should expect seriousness from this movie. It's a total entertainment film with tiny bits of almost everything you could think of, family friends, science, faith, myths, action, romance, politics, cars, women, sacrifice, extra terrestials, good, bad etc. Though I liked it, I reserved it for specific moments, not for genuine experience, due to lacking the serenity of progress but rather for getting relaxed and fun. A film satisfying teenage fantasies combo into one, intended for entertainment only and I was entertained in the 1st-2nd watch.A 7/10. A 73/100.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I seem to recall taking Transformers into sand was a bad idea...,"What an appalling piece of tripe.Michael Bay is a hack. If there is any justice in the world, he will one day be kidnapped by people with actual talent. They will force him to watch his movies over and over in a Clockwork Orange chair until they break the soul he clearly doesn't have.As someone who loves movies of all genres, Transformers 2 offends me on a deep personal level. Michael Bay's latest opus is a testament to the dark, greedy, soulless side of the movies. Anything for a buck, lowest common denominator, pandering to the base nature of humanity, crap.That bad? Oh yes. And its insidious. There were 2 things in this movie that were better than the first one. The transformers transformed more slowly so you could actually see it happen... well, you would be able to if it didn't also look like the movie was edited in a wood chipper. The Transformers also had more personality, which was an improvement over last movie where the only way to tell which giant robot was Optimus was to look for the Mac Truck.However, there is a dark side to these new personality-filled robots. The appearance of Amos and Andy in robot form was awful. Nothing like 2 buck-toothed, illiterate, bumbling, stereotypes to affirm that Michael Bay is either completely racist or completely naive. His comment that, ""they're robots,"" is moronic. And Jar Jar is just an alien.There was so much action it was sort of like an assault which got increasingly tiring. Yeah, the special effects were pretty and the explosions were loud, but 2 hours and 40 minutes of straight Michael Bay action was incredibly boring. Part of that is his style. The aforementioned wood chipper editing does not help anything. You can barely see whats going on. Despite the loudness, I fell asleep. Twice. In a theatre seat. I've never been that bored in a movie in my life. And it was 2 hours and 40 friggin minutes long! Indulgent and vapid. There was not enough movie to justify it being that long.The problem is the movie is all surface. There is an overly complicated plot, which really doesn't need to be there at all. Why explain giant killer robots in such depth? To appease the fan boys? I doubt that'll happen. They're already angry. And the plot is not engrossing. The characters are irritating. All the humor is fart and testicle jokes. The dialog... I'm actually in the process of repressing it, but robots + declarative = bad news bears. Out of self defense Michael Bay has to rely on fiery explosives and robots hitting each other with trees. He is incapable of every part of making a movie that is not special effects.There was a love story, which mostly involved Megan Fox bending over and pouting and then her face spiraling around near the end in a completely mystifying moment. Of course, to show how epic the love was, Bay decides to spiral around our couple in 360 camera shots that directors don't generally use. They don't use them because they are disorienting for the audience and considered amateurish. So after 5 straight minutes of rotating cameras I was ready to vomit, and it wasn't entirely the revolting meditations on saying I wuv oo first from Shia and Fox.You know, I can't actually do this movie justice. It was that bad. It was everything I hate in a movie. Everything. I think I died a little inside last night.And Michael Bay? Please do not rape anymore of my childhood memories. I can't take it. You should be ashamed of yourself.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Disagree Completely,"I fully enjoyed this movie, unlike some viewers. Even though I didn't look as deep into the movie as other critics may have, the actuality of an entertaining, somewhat family friendly, and unique movie plot was accomplished within this movie's length. I enjoyed the acting, I enjoyed the dialogue, and my grandmother, who hadn't seen the first one, immediately caught on to the continued plot. This movie was very well plotted, story boarded, filmed, and edited. I also send kudos to the graphic animators for a truly outstanding job.As a non-professional story writer, Filmer, actor, and editor, this film was very highly mastered and very well thought through. I am aware people may disagree, and I am in no way trying to counter dict anyone else's thoughts on the movie. I am simply saying it was not ""as bad"" as some people make it out to be.Remember, we are dealing with something that kids dream of and imagine thousands of possible ""wars"" the transformers fought in as young children playing with action figures of these timeless toys.It's not easy pulling a movie off like this. Kudos to all of the cast/crew. I enjoyed it very much. Thank you.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An easy escape to a fantasy world,"Can you take a movie seriously in which alien robots can transform into cars or planes? I can't. Transfomers 2 is supposed to be an entertaining summer popcorn movie and nothing more. It's made for the masses to make a hell of money. Good acting is not needed. Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox are the young attractive couple which is fighting with the good Transformers versus the bad Transformers. Both are shining and part of the pleasure. I enjoyed seeing Jon Torturro again as crazy former Agent. There is a lot of plenty CGI Action in it and typical for Michael Bay Explosions en mass. The Humor, Dialogues and Plot are made that everybody round the world can easily follow it. It's more difficult to find out which transformer is fighting against whom as to understand the movie. Not the best flick ever but it's a simple escape to a fantasy world. Turn off your brain and enjoy this piece of entertainment.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Stop the whining. It's a cool film!,"what a bad story, bad characters, bad dialogues, as all bad ... tired already read it.I got great pleasure from watching the film and not for one moment regretted that I looked at it - excellent action scenes, cool transformations, romance with beautiful girl, normal humor (not great, not bad) - this film has everything that I love. And I do not care that this film does not match the animated series.from the very beginning I did not expect from the movie deep story - it is not necessary in it. all that is in the film, enough to enjoy. and I'll be waiting eagerly 3rd part of Transformers",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A snuffy mess,"You know you're in for a royal mess of a script when the scene which kicks the whole story off is the main character conveniently 'just so happens' to find a piece of 'the all spark' in his jacket!? Followed by a totally unnecessary gremlin-transformers blow up the house scene. We find Bumblebee is being kept in the garage like a bloody dog... Toilet humor... Very quickly the smile on my face from the opening Shanghai sequence (which looked great, along with a forest fight later on) quickly started to fade.From here to got worse. Shias crazy roommate (who serves what purpose?) Shia caught cheating with a TX from Terminator 3 (yes, I'm not kidding). Annoying 'stuck in there' scenes with Shias parents. Where there wasn't stupid, loud, humour, there was explosions.The constant noise and explosions and grey messes of metal fighting wore thin on me very quickly. Action needs breathers, set up, anticipation. And give the robots some colour for Christ's sake! The movie did not need the comic relief of what people are calling the racist 'jar-jar twins' but I enjoyed the seeing some primary colours I have to say. All in all though, this movie was the pornographic equivalent of a 2 hour close up of a knob ramming an a'hole. Maybe some people want that but I don't want to see it. Show us a little foreplay, a little tease, change position, anything!Speaking of porn, that's also the reason Megan Fox didn't work. She looks like she's in the wrong business. She also has zero charisma or personality (though the writers could be to blame here). You see makaela would have worked if she was smoking hot in a pretty sense and a touch down to earth (attainable) so an audience could dream their were Sam. We would of related to her more and therefore cared about her. It also would have made the T-X 'seductress' work in the film work. But she's less hot than the ott megan! Talk about the girlfriend experience. How much is Sam paying for the privilege? And the story spoke of being faithful? Come on, how could you trust Fox? Seriously. In skimpy shorts and low tops hanging around motorcycle grease monkeys all day? Add this to dogs dry humping, robot radio control cars dry humping... Who is this movie aimed at?I mostly enjoyed the first film. It worked for the most part and felt like the story had been worked and then shot, as opposed to being shot while they worked it out. I think the transformers franchise could of worked brilliantly. It needed more 'Berg less Bay though. Given us a touch of wonder and magic...Star Trek still makes the summer a success. That was so enjoyable it counts for two movies. Same writers, yeah, but Bay would have turned the dark knight into a noisy snuffy mess.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The movie suffers from the fact that people hate Michael Bay.,"I've read comment after comment trashing this movie. I honestly don't know why! Yeah it's got some dumb stuff in it, but so did the first one. And am I the only person who actually watched the original transformers series? Or the 1987 cartoon movie? It was PACKED with stupid scenes and bad dialogue! There was even a scene where a Weird Al song called ""dare to be stupid"" played and all the transformers broke out into a huge dance number! No my friends, this movie is loaded with action and humour. The only problem with it is that people immediately hate it because Michael Bay is at the helm. People were lining up to trash the first movie but guess what, to everyone's surprise it was actually good! This film is no different. The first movie developed the characters which leaves more room for action in this film. But due to the simple fact that people couldn't trash the first film because it was actually good, which meant it was open season on this film no matter what the quality of the movie.So yes, I am a Michael Bay fan, I love The Rock, enjoy both Bad Boys, always get a kick out of Armageddon, and so on. Do I expect any movies like this or any of his future films to win the best picture Oscar? No, I expect them to be entertaining, which so far has happened every time.So here's a tip for you, if you hate Michael Bay's movies STOP &*%#ING WATCHING THEM! I hate Uwe Boll's movies, so guess what I don't watch them anymore, same with Roland Emmerich (who is often compared next to Bay), Renny Harlin, and a few others.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great movie BUT,"I'll agree with most everyone the effects were off the charts and looked great. Whose idea was it to add an un-educated hip-hop Chevy green robots with a gold tooth? Some of the comedy was good and original but the two idiot cars, come on! Totally a Jar-Jar Binks character the two of them, lame idea. It was almost comical that the Hot Megan Fox was airbrushing a bike while straddling it, I laughed along with a lot of other people behind me. Just make it original PLEASE! She would of looked just as hot if she were painting it like a real person! The effects were awesome, the forest fight was by far the best part of the movie. The only time the movie theater was silent really! The rest of the time there were to many people laughing. Some comedy is good, to much and it really disappoints. And I can't leave out the sissy roommate cyber computer guru that was a total sissy, can you edit out his character as well as the two lame Chevy robots. Maybe in the third one they will add a bonafide Alien from area 51..LOL..um Spielberg! He could transform his saucer and turn into a robot Indiana Jones with a laser whip. Overall it was a great movie for effects and new bad robots they previewed, but I would edit out a lot of the movie. I would of shown more of the robots and less humans.

What do you expect?,"It appears that most critics have dismissed the latest Transformers movie simply because it's a Transformers movie. They seem to be saying something along the lines of: ""this is an awful film and I can't believe everyone is still going to watch it and it will still make lots of money."" Well really, what did they expect? This is not full of drama and amazing acting, this is not going to teach you a moral lesson or change your view of the world. This is a popcorn movie intended to show you lots of explosions and exciting action scenes, and on that count Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen succeeds brilliantly. Why should every film be about perfect acting and drama? Why can't we be allowed to enjoy a popcorn movie without being called stupid? Why are the so called 'smart' films so acclaimed, while the popular films that keep the movie business running are ridiculed? I could complain about this forever, but instead I'll describe the film. Firstly, the storyline. You don't need to have seen the first film to understand what's going on, although I suppose it would help. The plot is certainly not simple but as with most films like this you don't need to follow the plot to understand what's basically going on: bad evil robots trying to destroy the world while the good robots and humans try to stop them. It's far more complicated than that, there were a few moments when I lost track of what exactly was happening, but you can still enjoy the film nonetheless.The acting is alright, there were no moments that felt out of place. The parents were both superb, completely hilarious at all the right moments yet able to switch to serious and terrified when required. The two leads were also good, Shia LaBeouf felt natural while Megan Fox was perhaps used more for her looks than anything else. There were a few moments that were obviously placed just to show off how perfect her body is, but I'm guessing the male half of the population won't see that as a fault. There are also some fun new transformers added to the cast, and the voice acting is excellent. There are a lot of supporting characters, many of them get some great one liners, some however felt a little unnecessary, but they're all played well.As for the CGI, it's simply astounding. The mind boggles at the thought of how much work went into this film and how much it must have cost. Every detail is perfect, every action scene gloriously orchestrated. This is a film with so many explosions, so many guns and tanks and jets and, of course, transformers, that not a moment goes by when you're not entertained. Is it used in excess? Are the special effects the only reason to see this film? Perhaps. But why should that be a bad thing? I went in to the cinema expecting to be amazed and I was.It's not all positive. There are some jokes that fall a little flat, some moments that feel contrived and the end is a little predictable. It's probably not as good as the first movie. Yet the critics are wrong, this is not a bad film. It set out to be an action film with great special effects and it is certainly worth seeing if you enjoyed the first or just want to see explosions. Maybe the fact that everyone is going to see it and it's going to make a lot of money should prove that the critics' definition of a 'good' film is sorely lacking. Whatever the case, I for one am looking forward to hearing the inevitable news that there will be a Transformers 3. If the special effects are getting better and better, I can't wait to see what they're going to do next.My score: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good but did not live up to expectations.,"Liked the beginning, flashback to 17,000 BC was kinda cool, kinda cheesy. The first fight scene in Shanghai with Lennex and the Autobots was pretty awesome, I wish there'd been more of Arcee though. (That's the chick Autobot!) A lot of the exposition after the college scenes and the race across Egypt were too drawn out, scenes could have been cut or shortened. The ""I love you."" and its ""your destiny"" were way too clichéd and just cheesy. The very ended was cut short and felt rushed. Bang we won! Now one sentimental message and no after footage, oh movie's over. Sequel coming, you can tell.The best moment in the whole movie was the way they worked Simons back in. That was brilliant. Jetfire was also incredible. At last a ""I'm too old for this."" from a guy who was still easily winning the fight. Mikaela' pet Decepticon was also cool, and hilarious, but he vanished in Egypt. I missed him after that.Overall: Too much exposition, too many random robots with no explanation, too many Decepticons, too much Mikaela, too much room mate, too long of a fight across the desert. Not enough back story on characters, not enough Bumblebee, not enough Arcee, not enough of a final fight at the pyramids.It was a good movie, it just didn't quite meet the great standards set by the first one.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
don't waste 2.5h of your life on this,"I'm sorry but I cannot find anything positive to say about this one... An hour after the start I wanted to leave the cinema but then I decided to see how bad this can really get - and I can honestly say that I haven't seen bigger trash in years! I used to be a fan of Transformers while younger, and believe me - the cartoons were way more serious than this one, even though made for kids. Cheep thrills! Mindless action and explosions, stupid jokes at best, totally predictable scenes and unoriginal ideas. On top of that, in your face all the time - the hot chick Megan Fox, looking unreal in every scene (in the middle of exploding buildings, the desert sand etc), boobs jumping all around and everything - it just shows how they tried to make it up for the poor plot, and it starts to get on your nerves even if you're a horny teen.

You can't complain like ""there are too much robots."" Of course, you idiot, this is a robot movie. If you go and watch this movie and complain about too much robots, then you are in the wrong theater buddy. Transformers 2: The Revenge of the Fallen is a great action movie. I went to see my childhood heroes and villains beat the hell each other and firing at each other with super-duper weapons, guessing what will come out in the end from the start. I watched this movie to be entertained, to see my Transformers toys come to life, to see Optimus Prime in all his glory and I got what I went for. The rest is detail.

"Special effects, and a thin plot, oh and, special effects.","This movie is a typical Michael Bay movie. It has everything to it, that a summer flick needs. A somewhat poor plot, a hot (the worlds hottest) girl, and someone is chosen to save the universe. The acting in the movie isn't the best but it is not at all bad either. If you come with the same expectation as me, it is just what you expect. An action-packed movie filled with special effects, slowmotion, and may i say, awesome fight-scenes. It has everything you want to see in a hot summernight. You can sum it up: 80% action-packed fight and demolition scenes. 20% storyline. - Or at least what i thought about it after. In my opinion, it is a movie everyone who likes the action-genre will love. It's definitely time well spent.

Megan Fox and shiny cars,"Don't get it twisted, I am the biggest CGI fan on the planet, I mean to the point where it becomes ridiculous. I can hardly mention how intimate I got with myself during Jurassic Park and T2 back in the days. For me CGI is incredible because when it's done right it opens up new worlds and fantasies. Look at JP, Matrix, LOTR, these are examples where it works, in this movie it doesn't.We've seen the first Transformers, they can transform and it looks good and that's why I actually kinda liked the first one. I agree that the plot was thin already in the first one but the new type of cgi used made it a worthwhile movie in my book, a great theater experience.So these days you have to make a trilogy if the first one is successful, it's simply one of the ways the studios make bank. In some cases the sequel gets pushed through just for the sake of making a sequel. You saw it with Matrix and Spiderman how horrible it can be, but with Transformers we have found a new low, one that I think will not be beaten for a very long time.It's simple, there is no creativity, no idea, no story, no message and nothing new at all. This is a 2 hours action ride that ultimately have you hoping for the doors to be kicked in to have the theater taken over by terrorists or something else to break the sleep hypnotic piece of crap you are watching (ouch, I went full out hate, ow well lets keep going).Let's just assault the premise of the movie a bit.Megatron was killed in the first one. You might think they would disassemble him, melt him down, send him to the sun or something to make sure this was it. Naaah, the American government and those in charge of security had a brain aneurysm here. Instead they thought ""hmm what are we going to do with this dangerous creation now that it's dead?"". The answer was of course to drop it in the ocean and keep like 10 cruisers and submarines around JUST IN CASE he should wake up again or someone might come to pick him up. This is early in the movie that this moronic premise is revealed.So I won't reveal anymore because then it becomes spoilers but if you have a brain you HAVE to leave it at home if you want to see this movie. Seriously, do not think about ANYTHING. Look at the transforming cars and let out the occasional ""wow"" and you might actually make it out. My IQ dropped about 50 points from watching this movie which explains why I can't spell English words anymore I suspect but at least I made it out, I doubt everybody will be so lucky.Trust me, the last 45 minutes you will be begging for the movie to end and you wished you would have never have to listen to 30 minutes of actors trying to justify the most ridiculous plot in movie history.But Hey, Megan Fox's titties bounces around a lot and there is a nice shameless intro shot of her on a bike.The people HAVE spoken, this is a commercial success but I dare ANYONE to try and watch this movie twice, it simply can't be done unless you are completely retarded.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Nuggets of humor,"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is vintage Michael Bay (remember Armageddon and Pearl Harbor) with explosions every other second, dialogue lost under the noise, and a plot so derivative you'll wonder why you're in a showing of King Kong Meets Indiana Jones.No matter, the audience loves the audacious pyrotechnics, vacuous plot, and Megan Fox in short shorts on top of a motorcycle—perfect for summer. Though not intricate, the plot is varied from Sam (Shia LeBeouf) going to college leaving behind the foxy Mikaela (Megan Fox), the Autobots landing out of a job protecting earth, and the rising of the fallen. Not one thread is deftly or deeply handled, but surprisingly in between the explosions are nuggets of humor if not lost to the noise. For example, on the college campus Sam's parents quip:Judy Witwicky: Look at this place! I feel smarter already! Can you smell that? Ron Witwicky: Yeah, it's the smell of $40,000 a year...Well, it's not great humor, but the moments of chuckles put it leagues ahead of this summer's Terminator Salvation for human interest if not depth of characterization.In addition, fleeting reference to swine flu and Obama remind us that even such a superficial sci-fi as this has hopes of greater meaning than just action. If you feel good about cars morphing into monsters, you may be the critic to see this film as an allegory about the monster car industry eating up bailout money or girl friends looking like Megan Fox dutifully waiting for college-bound nerds like Shia LaBeouf. The possibilities are endless, as are Transformer flicks, I suspect.Bay is Bay, a director who understands the taste of an action-lusting summer audience.Hey, it's summer.

Great visuals ruined by bad directing and cheesy acting,"What a sad result for such great visuals. I hereby congratulate Michael Bay for his great achievement of ruining this movie since it really requires some talent. Lets start with the actor selection. The only difference between lumber and Shia LaBeouf is Shia LaBeouf can talk. Given this fact, I really don't see any reason for his existence on this (or any other) movie. I mean it, this guy has no talent at all, he doesn't have an attractive physic or anything that can justify his presence in a movie. Also, the female characters made the plot more cheesy and they were totally unnecessary. Lets put some sexy girls and silly jokes to make a teenage movie. Unfortunately it doesn't work like that. I have never seen a classical movie with cheesy plot. Especially in sci-fi, this cheap tricks are just ruining the movie. I don't want to hear a stupid joke when there is an action packed fight scene. If you want to make a remarkable movie, you should be serious (I prescribe the director some James Cameron movies so that he may see how sci-fi is done). The last battle was really great in terms of visuals but overall, there is plenty of room for improvement. It is so sad that the third one will be done by the same director.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Revenge is coming.,"Decepticon forces return to Earth on a mission to take Sam Witwicky prisoner, after the young hero learns the truth about the ancient origins of the Transformers. Joining the mission to protect humankind is Optimus Prime, who forms an alliance with international armies for a second epic battle.So there it was. The trailer. Played on the silver screen. It looked darker than the previous film. The tagline ""Revenge is coming"" reinforces that aspect. It excited me. This could really be a serious, dark movie, like THE DARK KNIGHT. I was wrong. So wrong. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. I was insane hoping for a serious, dark, gritty action flick from Michael Bay. In fact, the trailer doesn't show any of the crude and sexual humor throughout the film. And you know what? I found the jokes pretty funny. Sure, some of the jokes are just disgusting (you'd be surprised what lays hidden in this movie), but I liked the laid back feel.The plot was...confusing, I will admit, but in a film like this, does it really matter? The movie never ceases to be entertaining. The action sequences are amazing, but directed by Michael Bay, it's not surprising. If there is one thing I have to say about him, he knows how to entertain audiences. And he was right when he said there would be more action scenes in the film. You thought the first movie had a lot of action scenes? Oh, God, I wouldn't even begin. To keep it simple, the special effects are nothing short of being flawless. I loved the score by Steve Jablonsky, most of it being brought back from the first movie.In an interview with Megan Fox, the sexy actress said the following: ""This movie is not about acting."" And she's right. I can go on saying that the humans in the films were actually the robots, but that's not particularly true. You have to give credit to Shia LaBeouf's part, at least. He does a swell job, given the material. I found John Turturro to be quite annoying in the first film but the producers or writers decided it was a good idea to bring him back. I still found him annoying in the film and I especially rolled my eyes when he was doing a serious scene.This goes along with Sam's parents in the film, Kevin Dunn and Julie White, although I don't find them quite as annoying. In fact, I enjoyed most of their scenes. They give some good comic relief throughout the film. I just didn't like them being serious because you just can't take them seriously. The writers apparently thought Ramon Rodriguez's character was a good idea. I just really hated him. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson also returned for the sequel, although they don't have much to do. Overall, the whole cast pretty much had one thing to do: Run in slow motion.With all the positives, there was no doubt some negatives. The most obvious is the overly long running time. I don't think Michael Bay ever made a movie less than two hours. I would've liked the movie if it were thirty minutes shorter. It was until the third act that I realized how long the movie was going to be. It started to meander a bit after that and there came a point in the film that there was just overkill. The movie was just really long. Another thing that annoyed me was a pair of twin Transformers. Actually, add another Transformer. All three of them were yelling profanity throughout. Not my thing.If you walk into the movie with the right mindset, you'd be surprised that you had enjoyed most of the film. The action sequences are just fantastic but the plot is lacking. The actors don't have much to do but to run around and scream. But really, what are you going to expect when you walk into a Michael Bay film? A plot? Great performances? A delightful script? Nah. You'd expect action. Action. And did I mention action?",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
HK Neo Reviews: Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,"Tagline: Pure eye candy entertainmentReview by Neo: Smack bucking, loud, noisy, big, and robotic and smashingly hot are automatic words that storm out of my mouth. Seriously, what more does a twenty something guy wants in a movie, hot girls, hot cars and the backdrop of Egypt? If this film is the answer to what works in Hollywood, then the art of commercialism is answered. Director Michael Bay (Bad Boys) is no stranger to big budget special effects flicks and for sure, Bay leaves no budgets unused and no stones unturned. In fact, the transformers are so complicatedly designed that some member of the audience may even watch it a second time or quite simply as my friend puts it, ""let's buy the toy just to see it more clearly"". Pure marketing genius in my opinion, but putting all that aside, this Transformer sequel actually works and despite being 30 minutes too long, it is ultimately entertaining and it leaves my eyes candy coated.The film follows on from the first film with Shia LaBeouf (Eagle Eye) moving on to college and leaving his super hot girlfriend (the irresistible Megan Fox) behind. As predicted, his college affair will be short lived, as the bad transformers goes after him for some metal specimen that can bring ancient transformers back to life. So together with his hands down sexy girlfriend, Sam goes on a journey and fights a battle alongside the good transformers with the bad transformers.To be perfectly honest, I was no big fan of the first Transformers movie; the simple fact is that I managed to fall soundly asleep in the midst of the transformers fighting it out. So for me to remain soundly awake, it must really be something. Perhaps it is the very presence of Megan Fox running around the desert of Ancient Egypt that got me fascinated, but then again, she really is the next Angelica Jolie.Shia LaBeouf reprises his role as Sam, the boy who conquered the bad transformers and the one with the super hot car and girlfriend. LaBeouf is a steady improving actor, and since the first Transformers, he has got himself involved in Indiana Jones and Eagle Eye. The only problem with these roles, is the very fact that they are the same, they all require him to be the hero as some sort, and quite frankly, to act like he is intense around his surroundings. Clearly roles that are hardly difficult, but it must be said that he handles them well and even if he somewhat does not deserve Megan Fox or Isabel Lucas, that is actually another story.To the new Hollywood goddess, Megan Fox, it really doesn't matter that her role in the Transformers series is irrelevant or even unimportant, as she is simply the perfect eye candy solution. When the picture gets a little dull, one glance of Fox lightens up the screen. It's been a while since an actress have that kind of sexiness on screen without even stripping down. It is not hard to see why the world is going crazy over Megan Fox, as she is easily, the hottest actresses in Hollywood right now. Not to shame, Aussie girl, Isabel Lucas (who used to star in the Home and Away series), but she pales in comparison with Fox. She is pretty and perhaps even hot, but when you pit her alongside, Megan, it is just impossible. Fox is bigger in areas that are meant to be and the lips are just plain sexy.All in all, Transformers is easily a good guilty pleasure to watch and it is probably safe to say that director Michael Bay is the one that can always deliver big budget special effects that works commercially even if not critics' friendly. With more transformers than ever before, adding in the Hollywood myth of Ancient Egypt pyramids being built by Aliens, Transformers is really a lot fun. Yes, the film is 30 minutes too long, it is not believable, but really who can resist a sport car that can transform, the joining power of several transformer, the beauty of Ancient Egypt and if all fails, we still have the undeniable, Megan Fox  (Neo 2009)I rate it 7/10www.thehkneo.com",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Garbage,"This is arguably the worst piece of trash that I've seen in along time. Was dragged to the theater and put my fake smile on, hoping to make the best of the experience and to see a bit of action. All I can say is, could they maybe have included a bit of a storyline?!?! Every scene was action after action, with Michael Bay trying to make everything seem ""cool"" so retards who don't appreciate a good film won't complain. The acting was horrible, but I can't completely blame it on the actors. The script, or should I say lack thereof, gave the actors no room to be more than mere two dimensional characters. Many of the characters were insignificant to the plot anyways (the military guys and the human decepticon chick). These characters added nothing to the movie and were added either to reprise their roles and please the fanboys, or to give the audience something to look at other than big f**king robots. I was dying to leave the theater about 40 minutes in, but I was with a group and didn't want to be an ***hole. I regret that I didn't. Two and a half hours of nauseating and noisy action. Michael Bay...just give up already...please!",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not *as* bad as some have been claiming,"I have to admit, I went into this movie expecting the worse based on everyone's review that I have read. From IMDb.com to feedback from friends, I have been told it was too long, it had bad acting and wasn't worth it.There was a fight towards the end that seemed to be a little too easy to win (I won't mention which fight or any other details to avoid spoilers), but outside of a few cheesy lines, I would say the movie was OK. It sure wasn't as good as the first movie, but wasn't THAT far off from it either. The music was fun, the special effects were fun, the many lines where they were obviously trying to be hip...at the most...were actually fun (or funny).Someone in another review said there was too much special effects and too much Megan Fox showing her cleavage off....but hey!...sounds like a classic ""good"" movie to me! Sorry folks, but that kind of stuff sells and I don't think they crossed any lines or over played it. As for the effects....this is a CG-packed action movie with a dramatic revenge title...what else were you expecting? It sure isn't a romance.I would say that this movie is not recommended for younger audiences since it does have a lot of profanity. Then again, with the ""hip"" approach to the use of language, I highly doubt its not something they already hear every day in school (regardless of grade). That's all up to the parents and how they want to expose or censor such.To give them a little credit, I went ahead and gave the movie an 8 out of 10. Why? Because it made me feel that I got my money's worth, it was a great movie, I would watch it again, and I left with the feeling that I would want to see another sequel. The acting wasn't that bad, despite the few cheesy lines as I have already mentioned.If you liked the first movie, I say go watch this one. One of the only things that didn't make this movie as good as the first one...is the fact that it lacks the element of surprise (aka ""its already been done once""). These kind of sequels almost always fall victim to fallacies and/or generalizations created by such.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Title: Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009) - A Visual Extravaganza with Mixed Results,"Title: Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009) - A Visual Extravaganza with Mixed ResultsTransformers: Revenge of the Fallen, directed by Michael Bay, is a high-octane action film that delivers on the promise of its predecessor with even more explosions, battles, and transforming robots. However, while it certainly provides a visual spectacle, the film falls short in terms of plot coherence and character development.The story picks up after the events of the first film, with the Autobots continuing to work alongside the military to protect humanity from the Decepticons. When Sam Witwicky (played by Shia LaBeouf) discovers a piece of the AllSpark shard, he becomes targeted by the Decepticons who seek to revive their fallen leader, Megatron. As the battle between Autobots and Decepticons escalates, Sam and his friends embark on a globe-trotting adventure to uncover the secrets of the Transformers' origins and stop the impending doom.From a visual standpoint, Revenge of the Fallen is a triumph. The CGI effects are stunning, with the Transformers brought to life in breathtaking detail. The action sequences are pulse-pounding and exhilarating, showcasing Bay's talent for creating epic spectacle on screen. The film's larger-than-life battles and jaw-dropping set pieces are sure to keep audiences on the edge of their seats.However, where Revenge of the Fallen falters is in its storytelling. The plot is convoluted and often feels like an excuse to string together action scenes rather than a coherent narrative. Character development takes a backseat to explosions and special effects, leaving many of the human characters feeling one-dimensional and underdeveloped.Additionally, the film has faced criticism for its juvenile humor and racial stereotypes, which detract from the overall experience. While the humor may appeal to some viewers, it often feels out of place in a film that is otherwise focused on epic battles and high-stakes action.Despite its flaws, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen still offers plenty of entertainment for fans of the franchise. The sheer spectacle of the visuals and adrenaline-fueled action sequences make it a thrilling ride from start to finish. However, those looking for a more coherent plot and well-developed characters may find themselves disappointed. Ultimately, Revenge of the Fallen is a film that delivers on its promise of epic robot battles but falls short in other areas.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What did I watch?,"Can someone explain this movie to me? Don't tell me the plot, I know the plot, what there is of it. Just tell me what I saw.It's one thing to create a movie with a lot of special effects, but when you sit in an overly long movie, you hope that the plot makes actual sense.Sitting through the the movie, I continually asked myself, ""How can you explain that?"" and ""Why don't they just...?"" Needless to say, I'm depressed that I spent money to see this. I put money in Michael Bay and the producer's pockets."" That will encourage them to create more of this tripe.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The first movie in the New era of cinema entertainment!,"I had quite an outstanding and unique experience watching this film, something happened that I've never experienced before in a movie theatre:Objectively, this movie is bad. The script is incredibly weak, the plot is full of clichés and can be summed up in several sentences, character development (if existent) is totally predictable and one-dimensional, and the characters are all genuine stereotypes - there are absolutely no ""normal"" people in this movie, every single person/robot that inhabits the world is a silly caricature of some kind. The number of bad things in this movie is beyond measure................except that I didn't notice a single one at all (!!!!) until later, when my friend and I went to grab a beer and pondered about the film a little...Yup....that's it. When you make yourself comfortable in your cinema chair, the lights go out and this whirlwind of a movie starts, it's something entirely different. Slowly, all of my senses became overwhelmed in a manner that my brain obviously decided to completely ignore every single thing that I look for in a (good) film in favor of pure fun. With my higher functions disabled like that, I just stared at the screen with my eyes almost out of their sockets and my lower jaw on the floor, and absolutely didn't notice the stupidity of some characters, plot holes and clichés, just incredibly enjoying this outstanding feast for my senses. Incredible, just incredible...With all the advancements in CGI, sound editing and cinema technology overall, I believe this film is (sadly or not?)the prototype for the future of cinema entertainment, where all the things that should make a good quality movie (like intellectual weight) will be dropped in favor of stimulating your most primitive senses to the n-th degree and pure entertainment value that goes straight up through the roof, a concept which is slowly developing in an art form of its own. Because of that, this is (all its numerous and gigantic flaws if you judge it as a ""film"" included) an absolutely amazing movie. If you're into some pure fun, go watch it.

"Good summer movie, but also typical Michael Bay.","I went into this movie not expecting a whole lot. I expected it to be nothing different than the first one. Loads of special effects and CGI, but also cheesy lines with a very thin plot. That is Bay's style of directing.I would have to say this movie is for some people and not for others. If you enjoyed the first movie, I am pretty sure you will enjoy the second.Do not listen to all of these users giving this movie 1 star.

Guide to enjoying this film as a G1 fan,"STEP 1 - Forget everything you ever knew, loved, or cared about regarding transformers. This step is important...so don't be lazy...erase every single little detail from your brain as far back as the first glimpse of the Autobots on Cybertron before they even crash landed here. Forget Rumble, forget Rodimus, and just pretend you've never even heard of the transformers before.STEP 2- Go see the movie in a small town. Some place where they still charge $6.50, like Austin or middle of nowhere California.STEP 3 - Pretend that you are going to see a one of those ""Scary Movie"" type of films that combines elements from eighteen other movies and franchises to make one funny, and somewhat disgusting film (i.e. the twins and john tuturro's naked ass).STEP 4 (final step) - Whenever in doubt, just stare at Megan Fox.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Basically, the same movie, but not as great.","Here's the honest truth about this movie. This movie does what the first movie did. Uses more Action than Character development. As far as the action goes, it was pretty interesting but compared to the last movie not as good. The Action was a lot messier in this one. Sometimes you can hardly tell what's going on. It's not without its moments, but again, the action doesn't hit the same.The characters, pretty much the same. Shia Lebeouf, Megan Fox, Josh Duhamel, all the same as the previous movie. They lead the movie just fine, but they don't have ANY character progression throughout.I will say, I am still impressed with the sound design, and art design of the Transformers. There were new ones that I thought were pretty cool looking, and fighting style matched perfectly to their appearance.The thing I thought was completely unnecessary were some of the toilet/sexual type scenes sprinkled throughout. I don't know if it was a Michael Bay decision, or a writing decision, but there were some that just didn't fit the movie, and just ended being cringe worthy.To be honest, I really thought I would hate this movie after watching it, but surprisingly I was still engaged with it. I still wouldn't call it a great movie, but I think it is worth A watch. Not more than once.D.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Good action film, Less than desirable plot and execution.","I went to this film feeling that I would be entertained similarly to the last one. It was exciting watching the great battle sequences, but when the plot slowed down to incorporate the human characters it was just uninteresting. Megan Fox's character was nothing more than eye candy, like the first film.The story revolves around the earth and the transformers having met before the all spark. Megatron is revived using one of the remaining shards from the cube. And he apparently is no master, but the apprentice of a fallen Prime, hence the Fallen. The plot has little coherence with the previous film. The story is completed when the decepticons attempt to activate ""The Machine"", which collects energon and is capable of similar feats to the all spark. Optimus Prime is the only one who can stop the fallen, being a Prime. He does so in rather handy fashion and the movie is left open for another sequel.Beyond the action sequences, the addition of the twins, who act much like rednecks and receive far too much screen time, and RC, the only female transformer, has no influence but to create a more congested world of transformers.The film, just as the first one, must be watched moving from one fight sequence to the next, the in between muck is not worth paying attention to. If you expected more out of Michael Bay you would be sorely sorry with this attempt to create a masterpiece from a beloved franchise.The action sequences balance out the lacking back story and below average acting. The CG is still amazing.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""Beginning,middle,end.Details.Plot.Compress.Tell it !"" -worthy advice for Bay !","I am going to start by admitting that I am a movie snob.I'm not easily pleased,nor impressed by what comes out nowadays yet I learned to adapt and appreciate this novelty genre namely ""summer blockbuster"",this sweet cancer rotting within the film-making industry,this symbiosis of sense-pleasing and brain-shrinking relish known also through the overused term ""pure entertainment"".Which is nothing but an excuse that protectively envelops the money-sucking tentacles of Hollywood.In view of the recent acclaimed comic/toy/cartoon films that conspicuously invaded the industry during the last of this sinful seasons,one may believe that after the consecutive critical and financial hits they finally got the right recipe to create the equivalent of a cinematic aphrodisiac.And they did,for a brief period climaxing with ""The Dark Knight"",the very moment when the two pedestals of money and acclaim reached a microscopical equilibrium on the balance of success.Notwithstanding, ""Transformers:Revenge of The Fallen"" is the epitome of the downfall of that trend;a downfall which I hope that won't victimize the average moviegoers for an extended period of time,and will be quickly followed by a gradual evolution.I walked into the theater expecting the safe formula that worked so well for the first ""Transformers"",which happened to be exactly the perfect blend of Hollywood's finest qualities used as an excuse for product placement.I left the theater virtually insulted by Michael Bay's effort of not letting us enjoy the mindless fun.The elements which compose ""fun"" alike ""TF1"",""Crank"",""Live Free or Die Hard"" are in abundance,unfortunately so are those that make up ""mindless"".There is no antagony between those two indistinct features of the movie,just the overwhelming and ostentatious quantity of both which leisurely prevented me from focusing on the first one while drinking my soda and stuffing popcorn in my mouth.A plot as smooth,clear and flat as a piece of Emmentaler (with an approximately equal amount of holes),a cast consisting of bankable,mediocre,overacting future-Christian Bales and teen-pleasing tediously artificial wannabe Angelina Jolies,a script as bewilderingly original and witty as the verses in Jonas Brothers' latest singles make up this simplistic and painfully elongated CGI extravanganza.It's the symbol of Hollwyood's worst,so obtrusive that ends up achieving an anecdotal value.There is one unforgettable flaw of this movie,obnoxious even beyond the blatant butchering of geography,army policy and organization,pointlessness of major characters (would someone kindly explain to me what was the outcome of the presence of Leo,the parents,the small blue robot,and the annoying government guy to the the plot ?) and awfully overdone premise,is the ""humor"".Or at least the complete and utter failed attempt at comic relief through repetitive perverted innuendos and low-brow racist teenage stereotypes which develop into an unbearable trend throughout the film.Mechanoid testicles ? Gangsta robots ? John Turturro's thong ? Mother getting high on pot ? Those are the clear signs that the divine hand of Steven Spielberg lost his grip on the project during the production of this predictable two-hours and a half hip-hop car commercial.Technologically speaking,this movie is a breakthrough in computer generated graphics and sound editing/mixing.Few scene in particular almost made me forget about the total artistic kitsch and enjoy magnificent backgrounds and character rendering at least for a few minutes.The cinematography is the sole improvement over the first ""Transformers"",with less shaky cam and more slow-motion to enhance the eyecandyness of the explosions within IMAX shots (which are surprisingly rare given the insane budget).Unfortunately,the movie fails on so many levels that technical brilliance alone cannot embody a redeeming factor.""Beginning, middle, end,"" Agent Simmons pleads to Jetfire. ""Details. Plot. Compress. Tell it."".If only Michael Bay and the writers had listened to the very character they created,this film could have been cut to half of it's length,and double it's value while avoiding a 19% rating from top critics and furious roars from dedicated fans .3/10 .",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

What is everyone's problem?,"I have been reading many people's comments on T:RotF. I finally had the chance to see it yesterday and I have to ask, what is everyone's problem? Everyone is blasting this movie left to right with comments on how it's too long, there's too much action, there's no story what-so-ever, there's gratuitous sexuality, there's blatant racism and stereotypes and so and so forth. This leads me to my next question: what's so different in this movie than what's in other action or sci-fi movies? This movie has a simple storyline with no twists or turns, it's got great action sequences, impressive visual effects, decent acting, and some good chuckles here and there. I agree that there were scenes that were crude or unnecessary, and content mature enough to warrant a 14-A rating rather than PG-13, but find a movie for me that doesn't have at least one instance of racism or crudeness, no matter how ""light-hearted"" it may be, and whether it be a movie for everyone or one for older audiences. Again, as for the action, there was no more or less action in this movie than there was in the first. The acting, storyline and humour was about equal and the visual effects were just as impressive. The problem is that people were expecting 1st prize when really all we were getting was an honourable mention. That honourable mention was exactly what I was expecting and I got exactly what I paid for.I don't want to ramble on so I'll just say that if you're a fan of Transformers, watch this movie.

Wow...,"I was a fan of the first film. It was decent for what it was about; transforming robots. Not a big fan of the original cartoons but I loved playing with the toys growing up. So my buddy and I went to catch this film opening night, and we walked out of there feeling like our lives had been deprived, as in we wanted not only our money back but our time we lost seeing the film.It follows the same basic formula the first one did; you got the transforming robots, hot girls, an O.K. cast, lots of explosions, but this one failed whereas the first one pulled it off. For starters, I laughed just a couple of times throughout the movie. O.K. so it wasn't meant to be a comedy, I'll keep watching for redeeming qualities. They never came. It was like watching Terminator Salvation all over again where it was the most unrealistic (and I'm not talking about transforming robots that fight unrealistic) movie I've ever seen. I expected this. The first film was unrealistic. However, at least they got some of the military stuff right which in this movie it's just all wrong wrong wrong.Then there's the plot development, or the lack thereof. Again, it's a Michael Bay vehicle I more than expected this. However, I didn't expect a COMPLETE lack of plot. It's as though literally the explosions came first and what there was of story was thought of on the spot as dubbing for the transformers. It was kiddish (again, Transformers, but more so than the first) it was filled with dumb dialogue from both autobots and decepticons, and it made me angry is what it did. I don't walk out of movies feeling like that; they don't get to me, but this one was just so horrendously bad that I couldn't help but feel mad I had to sit through it.You know there are people who loved it in there and they clapped, good for them. Just means that if this film succeeds Hollywood is going to again insult the movie going intelligence in order to make their millions. This is O.K.

It comes down to this...You are watching Transformers.,"As a huge Transformers cartoon fan and awesomely enchanted by the first movie I went to see T2 without second thoughts.

The movie score is similar to the previous one but can't help to say that Steve Jablonsky did an awesome job.

A movie struggling with identity problems,"Transformers 2 does not disappoint as a summer popcorn movie. It has all the ingredients for a summer blockbuster; a good fan base from the first movie, great special effects, and a popular cast. However, Transformers 2 was just a good movie and not a great movie, which it very well could have been.The opening sequence is good and sets up the story quite nicely but the story that is set up does not get a chance to fully develop throughout the movie. The reason is because Michael Bay can't decide on what to focus on. Does he make this an action movie? A dramatic movie? An action/comedy? There are too many different movie elements in Transformers 2.Some of the problems were the inclusion of too many low brow jokes in the movie. There is a scene involving Sam Witwicky's mother shortly after arriving at college that should not have been in the movie. It wasn't very funny and did not contribute to the advancement of the plot. These jokes throughout the movie take up screen time where dialogue explaining the plot and advancing the story should have been.Transformers 2 builds on the stories from the history of the Autobots and Decepticons, but those stories are not sufficiently explained and too much has to be assumed. The stories still make some sense and does not make the plot confusing or impossible to follow, but it makes the story seem incomplete.Where the first Transformers movie thrived on a strong story and good action scenes, Transformers 2 relies on just action scenes.I did give this movie a 7 because the story was still good. The action scenes were enjoyable to watch and the acting was well done. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson did great with their supporting roles as soldiers. It is easy for everyone to try to vie for the spotlight in such a big budget movie, but those two played their roles very well which is one of the reasons this movie was good.Transformers 2 also uses many elements from the original television series and some from Transformers: The Movie (1986). That made the movie more enjoyable as it was more in tune with the Transformers many of the fans grew up with. Bumblebee is still a lovable robot and Optimus Prime is still everyone's favorite leader. Megatron and the Decpticons are still just as evil as we all remember and the transformation of the beloved 80's cartoon series to a live action big screen film is just as amazing as the first one.Once you walk out of the theater a few things will stick in your mind. Optimus Prime is still a bad-ass and a terrific movie hero, the special effects were great and so were the action scenes, and Megan Fox is gorgeous. But, maybe the most important thing a movie should leave you imprinted with is not stuck in your mind and that is an intricate story that you want to see over and over again... maybe just twice, I know I'll probably see it again",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Summer Blockbuster Hits the Mark,"I'm not quite sure why this movie is receiving such terrible reviews. The so-called critics (with whom I almost never agree), predictably blasted it.

The action was intense, the machinery was awe-inspiring, and Megan Fox is incredibly HOT! There was humor sprinkled in and John Torturro was a hoot.I guess if I went to the theater looking for character development, unexpected plot twists, and the unveiling of the meaning of life, this movie would not deliver.

Let's roll,"Incredibly entertaining and fun- Transformers Revenge of the Fallen can be a bit problematic and messy at times- but between its incredible action scenes and fun charm- it easily surpasses the first film. I guess it's hard to describe just what I enjoyed about this film so much, maybe it was the action sequences- all incredibly complex and freaking awesome. Maybe it was the many new characters and their badass designs throughout, or maybe it was its sense of sheer energy that just carries the film to an excitable level I certainly haven't experienced in a while. Lets face it, the film has its problems. It can be a bit choppy at times, and has been fairly criticized for its racist depictions through its characters of Mudflap and Skid Mark- honestly the worst part of the film in general- as well as for me it's incredibly generic old british man robot who has an accent even though he doesn't know what earth is? If you're able to put these facts aside, the film was very fun to watch. I enjoyed seeing all the returning character and honestly got emotional at some parts I won't spoil, but needless to say i'm surprised I nearly shed a tear for a Michael Bay Transformers film. In the end, Transformers Revenge of the Fallen is a pure fun action romp with several issues. Its issues aside, it still makes for a fun adventure that is sure to please fans of the franchise young and old.My Rating: 7.2/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A DISASTER. Hollywood ignorance at its finest.,"It's pretty simple really Transformers 2 is one of the sloppiest pieces of garbage ever made. This film holds a proud place next to ""The Wild Wild West"" and ""Van Helsing"". The reality is that Michael Bay does not care about Transformers fans or ANY fans for that matter. Bay never took nor wanted to take the Transformers property seriously. It was Steven Spielberg who had kept Bay on a tight leash for the first Transformers and that's why the original movie is a decent film.TF: Revenge of the Fallen is a relentless mess of childish comic relief, horrible characters, and the worst writing in Hollywood history. And did I mention the jokes? Oh yes the jokes!! Sex jokes, pot jokes, fart jokes, penis jokes, ghetto robots, more fart jokes, and John Turturro..Nuff said. I swear this movie is so bad; it's almost as if Michael Bay was trying to purposely mock his own audience. Bay never liked Transformers, so now he has spent 2 ½ hours making the audience suffer for liking a franchise that he considers stupid and juvenile. It's amazing really Sure, Transformers is based on a children's toy line, but it didn't have to be like this. We could have had a quality adaptation that was on par with Star Wars or Harry Potter. But instead we get a big pile of garbage from a man who is such an ignorant film maker and some of the worst writers in history. .Shame on Michael Bay and his terrible team of Hollywood hacks",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Has the appeal of throwing pots and pan down a set of stairs,"I had a conversation once with a former associate who argued that the best way to enjoy the films of director Michael Bay was to simply sit back, turn off my brain and enjoy them. What he was saying essentially is that I needed to simply lower my standards and ask for less. Note that I said this was a former associate.Michael Bay makes blockbusters. He makes them loud, crude, violent and profitable. He made 'Armageddon', about rocks that threaten to destroy earth. He made 'The Rock', about a terrorist that threatens to destroy San Francisco. He made 'Pearl Harbor' about how the Japanese destroyed a navel base. Are you seeing a pattern here? He makes profitable films in which things get blow'd up real good. His excuse is that he makes films for audiences, not critics. Well, so did Hitchcock, but at least Hitch wanted to play us like a piano, not like a set of drums.'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' is a loud, crude, dumbbell action picture that has the appeal of throwing a set of cookware down a long staircase. The heroes and villains are robots from another world who can disguise themselves as mobile objects like cars, jets, tanks etc. They can even take the form of household objects like toasters or blenders. The reason they are here on earth is laid out in incomprehensible dialogue that I really I could not follow. It really doesn't matter anyway. The final scenes are an assault of noisy special effects and whip-cut editing that never allow you to get your bearings. Its like the movie was made to be a two-and-a-half-hour trailer for itself.The robots are seen early and often. There is no build-up or mystery about them at all. They are built of a convoluted mess of shiny metal pieces formed into something 40-feet tall with arms and legs. They have faces that aren't expressive but rather hidden by all the metal - it takes you a second or two to decipher where the eyes or the mouth are or if they even have them (why do they need them?). When they speak, they having nothing interesting to say. Their speech comes in three forms: Formal comic book boilerplate (""Die, like your brothers"") and pop culture buzzwords (""Punk-ass Decepticon!"").They make no logical sense in that you shouldn't ask how a 50-foot robot can contain enough metal to transform into a half-sized pick-up truck.Worse then trying to figure them out is watching them. All they do is fight, smash things and shoot lasers. A lot of things get smashed and a lot of lasers get fired. There are a lot of things that get blown up, a lot of things that get destroyed. The robot's bodies are made of metal, wires and gears. They look like moving scrap-heaps and when you get a bunch together to fight, you can't tell one from another.You have to ask why creatures from another planet would be metal robots anyway? Why is their speech such a mess of stale mechanical blandness? What do they have to offer besides weapons that can destroy stuff? What is their planet like? Where do they come from? Are there other organic beings out there? Do they know about us? Who built you guys? What's your technology like? How were you able to convincingly create a robot who was a human look-a-like? See, they wouldn't want to visit me because I would never shut up with the questions.The human characters in the movie aren't smart enough to ask those questions. The males in the movie are either college slobs or military archetype. The female are all gorgeous, smoldering in heat, and dress like Playmates. Shia LeBouf, the hero, runs through this movie looking dazed and confused while shouting at special effects. Megan Fox doesn't fare much better but at least I can give her credit for tiring of this material and bowing out of Transformers 3. The only romantic conflict between LeBeouf and Fox is the idea that he won't tell her that he loves her. Trust me, if a guy has the heart of a girl who looks like Megan Fox, the problem would be getting him to STOP saying it.Movies like this anger me. They are a determent to this art form that I love. They seem to have been made by people who don't know what movies are suppose to be about. Made by committee, they are filmed deals, made for box office, merchandise and beverage tie-ins. I like movies that ask something of me, they engage me and have a narrative that plays with my senses and my expectations and my sense of wonder. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is, I'm told, a movie that I am suppose to simply sit back and enjoy but, for me, that would be asking me to enjoy getting smacked repeatedly upside the head with a frying pan.* (of four)",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not what I expected...,"This is definitely not what I expected. The first Transformers movie was a so good adaptation that I was completely delighted with it... but this one... this is something else. Like first, there is suddenly a bunch of funny robots that are doing too much human things, and too much stupid things so they easily insult you intelligence, the least what I expected to see is an old robot which we see as ""old"" because he needs a walking stick and he has a metal beard?! And suddenly a character in the movie dies but later they find a way to revive it, and then another character dies so they find a way to revive him too, and some of the characters that died in the first Transformers movie get revived also... and then, big finale, another character sacrifices himself to give power to another... too much dying and reviving for me. Sometimes I had an impression I'm watching a drama. (I do not want to say what characters because I don't want this to be a spoiler)Well, the positive sides... the visual effects are very impressive indeed. Actually, they are right as I expected, but they are somehow buried under all this boring drama atmosphere. What I also noticed, in one scene that lasts for a few seconds, the rendered robots (autobots) do not fit the camera-recorded background perfectly... but let's say we can forget that. The humor is pretty good too, but just as I said, because of that humor, the sci-fi part paid it's price.The best, and most original characters in the movie according to me: Agent Simmons, Optimus Prime, and the little remote-controlled-car decepticon.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Definetly a must see!,"Yes it´s story is, reduced to it´s essence, a flaw. Yes the movie is a bit too long. And yes the movie kicks ass! Transformers 2 is Blockbuster Cinema par excellence! Loud, funny and enjoyable in every second. It´s a feel good movie and even better than the amazing first part.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
