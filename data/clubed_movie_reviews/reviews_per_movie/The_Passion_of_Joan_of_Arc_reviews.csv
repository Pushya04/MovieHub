The Good & Bad Of 'The Passion Of Joan Of Arc',"If you'll pardon the rambling, here are my thoughts immediately after watching this on DVD an hour ago.......THE STORY - Many of the times, while watching this for the first time, I thought this was almost the re-enactment of Jesus' last day, seeing the phony trial, the trumped-up charges He endured by legalistic, power-hungry religious leaders of the day who had no clue who God is, and then the tragic end to the central character. Apparently, there were a lot of similarities to Joan of Arc's last day and of Christ's day. However, here it's the Catholic leaders who are the 'bad guys' while in Jesus' time it was the Pharisees and the Sanhedrin. Also, with Joan's story here, she is portrayed far differently in her ordeal than Christ did, the latter taking everything in stride stoically while Joan, without any physical beating, still cried constantly and signed some paper in a moment of weakness (although she later recants that, which costs the woman her life.)Anyway, about this film:THE GOOD - Wow, what incredible direction and photography. Scene after scene is pretty amazing and especially so when you consider this was made about 80 years ago! I would like to see the same director and photographer doing work with today's technology.The expressions on Maria Falconetti's face throughout the film are memorable. A sadder, more pained look on Joan of Arc - or anyone else's - I have not seen in a motion picture. She also must have set a record that still stands for the most tears shed by one person in a movie! The woman's eyes were like faucets.All of the faces in here - and the film is mostly a series of facial closeups - are amazing and kudos to Criterion for making a DVD that showed these faces with a clear picture and amazing detail. Director Carl Theodor Dreyer's camera angles still look innovative today. He and Orson Welles seem to share the same love of this kind of photography. I found myself numerous times just shaking my head in admiration for how these characters were photographed.Another big plus for this film was the addition of ""The Voices of Light."" They made the music score in here fantastic. I can't recall too many films in which I have been so impressed with a soundtrack. The DVD gives you the option of watching this film with or without that audio. I strongly recommend viewers to take the audio.Finally, the story itself is memorable, with a powerful ending.THE BAD - I have to make these comments to be fair and honest. It's not hard to understand why many people will find this film almost impossible to sit through, especially those with no emotional or spiritual involvement with the story. That is because it is extremely slow and repetitive. Shot-after-shot of just Falconetti agonizing or crying and weird-looking men staring at her. If you aren't a devotee of cinematography, this movie could be extremely boring after about 10 minutes.As powerful as the story is, it isn't a movie I would recommend for most people. I think most folks - of any age, frankly - would be turned off after 20 minutes. I understand that. As mentioned, this is not an easy film to view. This might be the longest 80-minute movie you'll ever see, if you aren't into it.OVERALL - Visually and audibly: an astounding movie and one I am glad to have finally watched. If I was wishing to get into the movie business and wanted to learn how to shoot films, this would be a film I would study numerous times. Otherwise, one viewing is plenty. I can only recommend this film to a very select audience.",8.0,Anonymous,History
One of the Most Formally Striking Movies I've Ever Seen,"Carl Dreyer's ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" is a film that feels light years ahead of its time. Lean and mean, focusing its entire narrative on the interrogation of Joan that inevitably lead to her execution by burning at the stake, the film is kinetic in ways that most films even now aren't. Composed almost completely of tight close ups, Dreyer and crew cut rapidly between disconcerting, asymmetrical shots, giving the film a breathless, anxious, nearly frenzied pace.Maria Falconetti gives an almost unbelievably intense performance as the title heroine. Her performance, and the film in general, does get a bit monotonous -- it exists primarily of impassioned gazes into the middle distance, giant, tearing eyes opened wide, an expression of passionate, nearly demented religious fervor on her face. It's not a film that concerns itself with characters and plot, so we don't get to know Joan as a person. It's difficult to care for her particular plight and we instead feel compassion for her as one human being feeling compassion for another. For that reason, the film left me remembering its striking images and formal style more than any emotions I might have felt while watching it. But it's no less of a remarkable cinematic achievement for that.Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,History
A milestone in film history,"Technically interesting, but lacking in storyline - they could have built the tension much better, I think. Maybe it would work better if I cared about religion. Also the recently invented close-ups were taken a bit too far, as it was difficult to tell who was who with all the monk men looking so similar.Still, some neat images in this one, and definitely an important work in the history of cinema. Recommended as a study of advances in early filmmaking.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"an incredible directorial vision, and a devastating lead in Falconetti, make this one of the greatest achievements in all celluloid","Carl Th. Dreyer's The Passion of Joan of Arc was made, perhaps, years ahead of its time- my guess would be that if it wasn't burned after its initial release, it would've had as stunning an impact on the film world years down the line as Citizen Kane did. Though the use of close-ups and distorted angles were not completely new in this film, it felt like Dreyer was creating a new kind of cinema, one where reality, however cold and pitiful, was displayed with complete sincerity. There is also the editing (by Dreyer and Marguerite Beague), which has the timing that many directors/editors of the modern day could only hope to achieve (it has the influence of Eisenstein, only in a totally different historical context), and those moves with the camera by Rudolph Mate (who would go on to photograph Foreign Correspondent and Lady from Shanghai) that are precious- to call his work on the film extraordinary is an understatement.And it was crucial for Dreyer to use the close-ups and tilted angles and shots where you only see the eyes in the bottom of the frame, and so forth- he's developing the perfect atmosphere in regards to a trial set in 15th century France. It's all those eyes, all those faces, holding all those stolid mindsets that send Joan to her fate. Pretty soon a viewer feels these presences from all these people, so strong and uncompromising, and Dreyer does a miraculous thing- he makes it so that we forget about the time and place, and all of our attention is thrown onto those eyes of Joan, loaded to brim with a sorrow for where she is, but an un-questionable faith in what she feels about God. I wondered at one point whether Dreyer was making as much a point on people's faiths and prejudices in the almighty, or just one on basic humanity.There have been many before me who have praised Falconetti's performance to the heavens (Kael called it the finest performance in film), but in a way it almost can't be praised enough. What she achieves here is what Ebert must've felt watching Theron in the recent 'Monster'. I didn't even see her in a performance as Joan of Arc- I saw her as being the embodiment of it, as if Falconetti (with Dreyer's guidance) took Joan out of the pages of the trial transcript and her entire soul took over. There is something in an actor that has to be so compelling, so startling, and indeed so recognizable, that a person can feel empathy and/or sympathy for the person the actor's playing. All a viewer has to do is stare into Falconetti's eyes in any shot, close-up or not, and that viewer may get stirred to boiled-down emotion.For me, it was almost TOO over-whelming an emotional experience- when Joan is about to get tortured, for example, I found myself completely lost from where I was watching the film, everything in my soul and being was with Joan in that chamber, and for a minute I broke out in tears. That's the kind of effect that Dreyer's craft and all the acting work (including Eugene Sylvain as the Bishop Cauchon, and of course Artaud as Jean) can have on a viewer. I'm not saying it has to, yet The Passion of Joan of Arc could- and should- be considered a milestone in cinematic tragedy, where the images that come streaming forth never leave a viewer, and the detail for time and place becomes just that, a detail for the main stage. Love Joan or hate her, this is for keeps.",10.0,Anonymous,History
When viewing it we look at it as looking in a mirror.,"What can one say about this work of art that has not been said many times before by those far better qualified to explain both it's importance and place as cinema and art? I shall not comment on the greatness of the film's technical achievements; the stunning cinematography, the production design, the brilliance of the screenplay based on actual transcripts from the trial, or the perfection of Mr. Dreyer's direction. The performance of Falconetti as Jeanne d' Arc has a profundity and depth far beyond my ability to illuminate. I suppose the best I can hope to do is to share my feelings, however inadequately expressed, of the effect it had on me. To say that it may be the greatest film ever made is to sound both obvious and trite. That a work of such beauty and simplicity, made seventy-six years ago can still have the power to move audiences in an era of multi-million dollar, hi-tech, bombastic over-wrought cinematic drivel is in itself a testament to the vision and genius of Carl Theodor Dreyer, Maria Falconetti and their collaborators. It is nourishment for those that hunger for something more in cinema, a feast for the soul. It is a reminder that film can indeed be art, and this film like all great works of art, lifts and transports us from the routine of our work-a-day lives to enable us, if only for a moment to experience the sublime. When viewing it we look at it as looking in a mirror. That is to say we look into ourselves. We question ourselves as to our own beliefs, or the lack thereof and the strength of spirit that enables an individual to endure the unendurable. Viewing it is a profound experience the nature of which for myself is transcendent rather than religious, because I am not in the least a religious person. Transcendent because it evokes emotions and thoughts that I cannot wholly account for, or adequately explain.""La Passion of Jeanne d'Arc"" is stark, radiant, exalted, simple, (but never simplistic), and ultimately sublime. The rest is silence.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Devastating but brilliant masterpiece,"It's easy to overlook this movie. For modern audience and especially my generation (I'm 21), this movie is just close-ups of a crying woman and grumpy old men. But of course that's like saying Mona Lisa is just a picture of a woman, or The Last Supper is dudes eating. If you experience it with open mind, The Passion of Joan of Arc will give you one of the most profound visions of devotion, faith and martyrdom.I must confess, even I thought the praise of The Passion was too good to be true when I began to watch it. But when the film ended, I wasn't just impressed, I was completely devastated. The Passion of Joan of Arc is a downright amazing realization of Joan's last moments. There's not a hint of sentimentality, and still I was in tears. Yep. Call me a pansy, but this is one of the very few movies that had that impact on me.I don't know what else to say about this movie, sorry. The Passion of Joan of Arc counts as the most upsetting movie experience I've ever had, but it's definitely a positive one. On the contrary to what the other commentators have said, you don't have to be religious to be receptive in front of this movie. Believe me, I'm a hardcore atheist. If you're going to see this film -- I sure hope you do -- make sure it's accompanied with the Voices of Light soundtrack, which doesn't just fit the film well, but is amazing as a standalone composition, too. I can guarantee you won't look cinema the same way again.",10.0,Anonymous,History
timeless in every sense,"I saw this a few months ago on the big screen, just after Nosferatu, another silent classic. Both showings were supported by a live organ play, which has been composed directly for the movie, and which suited perfectly. I had seen Nosferatu before, but i didn´t know anything about `Jeanne`, and so i was in no way prepared for this overwhelming, soul-rapturing experience.My eyes were immediately glued to the screen. Unfortunately i had missed the first minutes, so it started for me with the first (?) court scene. The camera wandered through the faces of the court members, circled and focussed on Jeanne´s face. So beautiful, naked, strong and defenseless! I could rave on the technical perfection of this film, it´s clever editing, innovative and gorgeous cinematography, proper historical settings and pure storytelling. Carl Theodor Dreyer created a masterpiece. But the most outstanding feature of this silent are the performances; Maria Falconetti delivers simply the best performance of all times, and i can´t remember of any ´corny` overacting, which distracts most silent movies from the modern viewer, even the accepted classics. `La passion de Jeanne d´Arc´ is purest cinematic art, timeless in every sense.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Falconetti is amazing!,"A certain amount of credit must surely be paid to the director for the genius of 'La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc.' The daring camera angles, use of incessant close-ups and peculiar authenticity all may be attributed to Carl Th. Dryer. However, Renee Maria Falconetti is the reason this film indeed surpasses all attempts at reaching the Platonic form of brilliance. Her performance is breathtaking by all accounts. One can not help but remain mesmerized by her expressions. Yes Dryer's gift to us of so many wonderful close shots of Falconetti should be acknowledged. He must be praised for his relentless filming of scenes to produce the desired result. Yet to imagine anyone else in this timeless role (such as Lillian Gish who was said to have been considered) is to envision a less than perfect film. Unimpeded by the silent medium in which she worked, Falconetti's mere tilt of the head or gentle glance pierce the soul of the viewer. We see her speak in Jeanne's native tongue. We see her compelling portrayal of the anguish which the saint most certainly endured. It is almost as if we are watching what the director said he had found; the martyr's reincarnation! This actress presents to us her raw beauty unmarred by powders or makeup - thanks to a decision of Dryer. How bitter-sweet the fact that we have this once thought to be lost silent film and yet can not help now but to long for more Falconetti. And so we return to 'La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc' and with each of many tears and inaudible sighs marvel at the staggering accomplishment which is Renee Maria Falconetti's Jeanne.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Sensory Shift,"This film almost leads one to believe that sound betrays the emotion the eyes capture. Just as the blind develop hearing far better than the average, the deaf develop a keen sense of sight. I am convinced that a lack of dialogue forces us to read the language of the face and body, a verbage unmatched in beauty and nuance. Though the accompanying musical piece (be careful not to identify it as a score), so deliciously inspired by the film, enhances the visual playground; it is the actors' faces that comprise this tour de force. Ms. Falconetti shifts from worry and doubt to unabashed conviction in a single shot, giving the viewer the luck of seeing one's thoughts in progress. She needs no response to the interrogation, it's all in her face. Renee is not superficially beautiful and the lack of make-up only reinforces how bare Joan is, but it is the uncanny ability of an incomparable stage actor to be a window into the soul that makes her so stunning, for the soul we see is one we only wish to attain for ourselves. The Church sees what we see, and they respond just as clearly to her unspoken protest with vehement pomp. The cinematography is so astounding for its time no comment could ever do it justice. Though many comments can be made, and are, surrounding the inspiration and detail for the set, it is at its core an incredible gift from Dreyer to the actors meant to inspire. It plays little part in the film, but to pull an inconceivable last drop of reality from the actors. A testament I can imagine will never be matched to the incredible power of silence.",,Anonymous,History

Cinematography ahead of its time. Interesting recovered film.,"This movie, restored for the present day, is visually appealing to the modern viewer. The portrayal of Joan with bright, open eyes stirs up a variety of feelings. It also gives off the vibe of mystique and wisdom well beyond her years, a girl ground in her conviction, always cornered by dark forces in the room, yet remains a light.It is rather confusing with no back-story,as not everyone grantedly knows the story of Joan of Arc. But like any passion play, the purpose is not so much the circumstances to the setting, but the actions and reactions of the people in the moment.I found the film very ahead of its time in many aspects. Then dark tone in soon time became the staple of this director. The imagery of death and torture, though not graphic, seems graphic, and gives an illusion of terror in a way that may have seemed taboo in the more conservative 30's,40's, and 50's film making.The age old battle of clericalism vs. authentic faith and the centuries old account of Joan of Arc, are told through this near-90 year old movie that has a very modern feel. It has a timeless quality rare for an old movie.I do not think it ranks as high as the historians and students of film proclaim it. But is a must-must-see for any appreciator of film and arts.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Dreyer's masterpiece one of cinema's greatest artistic triumphs,"One of the last great silent films made during the advent of sound, Carl-Theodor Dreyer's The Passion of Joan of Arc is a haunting, riveting portrait of the historical martyr based on documentation from the original trial.  Focusing primarily on the series of courtroom examinations that doomed the young warrior, the film gloriously employs vivid close-ups to accentuate the ordinariness (while at the same time exaggerating the most grotesque qualities) of Joan's inquisitors.  Maria Falconetti is unforgettable as Joan, perfectly distilling the pain, terror, and saintliness required by what is probably one of the most demanding roles an actor could attempt.  The consequence of Joan's conviction -- her burning at the stake -- allows Dreyer to hammer home his exquisite visual motif balancing erotic corporeality with transcendent spirituality.",,Anonymous,History

A couple od details...,"I simply agree that this is one of cinemas true masterpieces, I'm with those who consider it one of if not the greatest film.Two details that I always loved; when Joan sits in her cell taking comfort by staring at the image of the cross formed by the windowpane, then the priest who pretends to befriend her but intends to betray her walks in and his shadow covers the image of the cross - wow, is there a more haunting or effective use of imagery in all of film?Also, I appreciated how at the end when she was about to be killed the same priest looked down on her, unseen, and bowed and shook his head with an expression of true sorrow. I think that was such a profound scene, showing that, though not exactly one of the good guys, he didn't really want her to die, he respected her strength and faith, it showed he was human - I thought that was an amazing, great touch.Also I'd like to mention Richard Einhorn's inspirational soundtrack that matches the film so incredibly well that I can't imagine one without the other. I'd love to shake his hand and simply say 'Thank you! ...you lucky dog!"" ;) ... to now and onward be associated with and part of this great film.

Simplicity of sets,"The simplicity of the sets in this film are absolutely breathtaking. It is a film that captures the imagination not so much with what it shows as what it doesn't show.This film is truly a ""passion."" Maria Falconetti expresses the pain and the anguish of a person who truly is being persecuted. Most of her shots are simply face or head-and-shoulder shots. Perhaps it is a reality of silent films that makes the images all the more compelling. Still, one can't help but wonder whether movies wouldn't be better today if the example set by this film and others like it were not followed.Maria Falconetti is stunning.

I've never seen any film, let alone another silent film, that sustains this level of emotional intensity for its entire duration.  The first ten seconds of this movie will show you why some directors chose to end their careers when talking-pictures became popular.  The expressions on the face of the incredible Maria Falconetti carry the drama in a way that no dialogue ever could hope to do.  My only warning is that this film is not entertainment; it is an overpowering work of artistic genius that could make a stone weep.

Vastly overrated,"After hearing the enormous amount of praise for this film, I was expecting to be swept off my feet.  However, I found myself incredibly underwhelmed by this incredibly mediocre movie.  Confused by my reaction, I asked two friends I had seen it with (both seasoned classic cinema fans) what they thought, and they agreed with me.  Together we worked out its three biggest problems.1. Worst of all, Dreyer assumes we will automatically sympathize with Joan of Arc, so he does little to help us in that respect.  Some may argue that scenes with cruel guards/priests are enough.  However, this argument fails since Dreyer never convinces us that Joan is truthful.  In fact, he accidentally gives the opposite impression, with numerous shots of her so wide-eyed she looks like she's about to pick up an axe and chop up the judges.2. None of the film's four most powerful scenes belong to Joan.  They instead belong to a torture device and various people who sympathize with Joan.3. The music is too good.  Normally, great music isn't a problem, but since there is so little quality on screen, ""Passion""'s music completely overshadows the rest of the film.  One of my friends went so far as to say he felt as if he was hearing an orchestration accompanied by various images rather than a film accompanied by music.Lesson: Not all critically acclaimed films are actually good.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Falconetti's breathtaking performance is undoubtedly one of the greatest the silver screen has ever seen,"Maria Falconettiis simply outstanding in this film; playing the eponymous character who claims she has seen and been sent by God, she delivers a transcendental performance that is overwhelmingly raw and visceral. Shot predominantly in close-ups, the tight framing restricts us to narrowly focus in on her state of fear and immerse us right into the emotional turmoil through which she is suffering. POV shots of the French clergyman ingeniously add to this effect as we experience the fear of the dire circumstances through Joan's eyes. And the fact that Falconetti never acted again only adds to the eeriness of her performance. With cinematography that was way ahead of its time and an incredible score to boot, this is simply a masterpiece of cinema. Far and away one of the greatest silent films ever conceived.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A Hideously Bleak Freakshow,"With Danish director, Carl Dreyer clearly going against the grain here in direct defiance of glamour and beauty - I'd say that as a perceptive film-maker - He was also something of a sadist to deliberately drag his audience through such an unpleasant religious-based hell as this.I mean - What an absolutely damning statement about the hypocrisy of Christianity this film's story inevitably made.Now 90 years old - This hideously bleak freakshow of stark, barren sets and unflattering close-ups sort of reminded me (in an odd way) of David Lynch's ""Eraserhead"".For me - The undeniably best moment in this truly unpleasant, yet strangely compelling, cinematic experience was, of course, Joan's tear-filled head-shaving scene.I think it's interesting to note that actress, Renee Falconetti (who played the Joan character) said that she never understood all of the positive reaction to her performance.",6.0,Anonymous,History

An essential work of cinema,"Carl Dreyer is one of the first and true masters of the art. His direction is always exceptionally controlled and crafted and for me this film encapsulates succinctly his dual expressionistic and formalistic approach to cinema. Although Dreyer succeeds in creating an extremely credible depiction of the trial and tribulation of Joan of Arc, he knew the filmic medium was not, and never could be, knowledge, fact or reality, and so he presents experience, truth and authenticity.The film can be argued to be entirely shot from the mind's-eye view of Joan in relation to her locality to give the impression that we, as Roger Ebert said, are not watching a film but in fact watching ""fragments from Joan's own experience"". Hence, the reason why everything is filmed in either, close-ups or medium shots, the reason why there are no establishing shots and very few visual linkages. Filming in this way also created the intended affect of overwhelming claustrophobia and discomfort for the audience- a mediation of persecution one could say.A lot has been said on Dreyer's inspirational use of the facial close-up in this film. His attention to the details on his performers faces, such as lines, warts, freckles, sweat and hair, and even on two occasions a fly, are used as revelations to their character and personality. The insignificant is made significant. Their faces are filmed in such a purist, ""microscopic"" fashion (no make-up was permitted by Dreyer) that their features and expressions convey a deeper more profound understanding of their emotions and thinking than words ever could. Renee Falconetti's face is also almost always seen in isolated shots and often filmed from a height thus accentuating her spiritual solitude and physical defencelessness. In contrast the trial judges and their faces are often shot from below, accentuating their threat to Joan and their dominance over her. Also her face is never in shadow and often captured in grey whereas the judges are always shot in shadow and have a more defined black and white composure, emblematic I believe of their inner good and bad.The acting is superlative undoubtedly helped though by Dreyer's cruel and unrelenting treatment of his actors. Dreyer became a notoriously demanding and dictatorial director after this film. He reportedly drove its star Falconetti into a mental breakdown in order to get the right emotional intensity he desired for the film. His pursuit for total realism, or to be more exact total authenticity, knew no bounds. The scene were Joan suffers a bloodletting was in fact real, albeit from a stand-ins arm. Falconetti never made another film again, yet her performance, I among others, deem as being arguably the finest ever filmed.Everything about this film is manipulated to convey the mind-set of Joan, her disturbed emotions and confused thinking, as well as her physical vulnerability and spiritual purity. Also anything that is not important to the conveyance of Joan's condition and situation is not included, hence the massive and very expensive set that was built but very little of it used. All the images presented conceivably convey what she could have seen and the way she might have seen it. Hence, the reason I believe for the upside down and backward shot of the English soldiers entering the gates of the castle, possibly a symbolic reference to St. Peter being crucified upside down, as allegorical parallels can be drawn with the historical story of Joan and the Biblical one of St Peter. Also, the swinging camera that makes the tower appear to be moving while she is burning is I believe a subjective representation of Joan's mental and physical suffering and the fact that she is about to depart from the earth. Either way these are certainly not just stylistic flourishes. The angular composition of the trial judges in relation to Joan and her relation to them, the off-kilter framing showing sometimes only half a head or at least only the head, and the fact that the judges are filmed moving in to and out of the frame only enhance capturing Joan's mental state of mind and her sincerity and honesty in the face of her Pietistic and duplicitous accusers. Furthermore, the weird and bizarre set designs from Hermann Warm, famous for his expressionist sets for The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, only add to the disillusioning and disturbing overall effect for the viewer.The themes of this film are also present in many of Dreyer's other works, namely his fascination with the incompatibility of institutionalised religion and individual faith, the physical dominance of the male over the female (somewhat dated now), and the power of the human soul over earthly ambitions and corruption. These themes appear to be of personal significance to Dreyer in nearly all his films. There is humanity and a desire to create sympathy, and not indifference, towards all his characters in his films.The Passion of Joan of Arc is an aesthetically austere yet serenely beautiful, psychologically uncompromising yet spiritually moving piece of work. The 15 hundred cuts and the way the film is structured, in clearly defined chapters, and, as already discussed, the way it is shot in close locality to Joan and always in relation to her immediate surroundings, gives the deceptive impression of simplicity and naturalness, whereas in fact the film is highly sophisticated and stylised. It also makes what Jean Cocteau said about the film even more true. That was, that it played like ""an historical document from an era in which cinema didn't exist"".Also, Richard Einhorn's 'Voices Of Light' musical score, first presented with the film in 1995, is an undeniably creative and truly inspired piece of work which adds to the intensely emotional, powerful and hypnotically engaging visuals of the film.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The greatest performance ever by an actress!,Dreyer's masterpiece is also Falconetti's masterpiece and the most powerful film role by any woman ever.

"Dreyer's ""Realized Mysticism""","*Note: This a review of the Criterion Edition DVD with the ""Voices of Light"" accompaniment.Over the decades Dreyer's film was a victim of religious and politic censors, two fires that destroyed valuable prints, unauthorized cuts, and zealous editors working against his wishes to modernize the film. An original, uncensored cut was found miraculously in a Norwegian hospital for the mentally ill (ironic?) in 1981 and fully restored for the Criterion Collection. Famed composer Richard Einhorn created his libretto, ""Voices of Light"", in response to his own experiences viewing the film and researching the history of Joan of Arc. The film can be viewed with or without the accompaniment, though I can't imagine Dreyer would've objected as Einhorn with great care honored the spirit of the film and arguably of Saint Joan with his compositions.Carl Dreyer's silent film, ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"", is a shocking example of the potential of film as art. No amount of scholarly critique can account for the raw power in viewing the film. It's one of those rare experiences that can only be seen to be understood. Dreyer's meticulously crafted aesthetics (the film is almost entirely composed of close-ups of the actors' faces) are perfectly married to the gut wrenching performance of Maria Falconetti (a theater star who never acted in another film) in the lead role. I think Dreyer was most accurate in describing her performance as nothing short of ""the martyr's reincarnation."" One need not be religious to understand what is meant or to feel for Joan as portrayed so humanely and exquisitely by Falconetti. Her face is beyond the realm of haunting, and Dreyer seers it into the audience's memory along with other stunning imagery like a window frame's shadow turning into a cross on the floor, worms crawling through a skull unearthed from a freshly dug grave, or a bored executioner barely able to hold up his head in the company of his torture devices. And then there's the burning at the stake and the brutal suppression of the peasant riot--unimaginable horrors rendered so beautifully and hyper realized onto a series of moving images projected onto a blank screen.The genius of Dreyer's visuals and Falconetti's performance is that they create a deep psychological complexity that can engage a modern viewer on multiple levels. In their bold suggestions and through the artistic integrity of their respective crafts, Dreyer and Falconetti leave it to their audience (weather it be a French nation still celebrating and mythologizing their 15th century hero Joan a mere eight years after her canonization in 1920 or a more skeptical 21st scholar studying the history of film) to decide the veracity of Joan's convictions. Was Joan truly a mystic, a martyr, a saint? Or was she simply mad and the unfortunate victim of the time period in which she lived and died? Either way, she is presented here as human. And in relating to her, one thing is for sure: the mysticism of film was realized by the Dane Carl Dreyer and Maria Falconetti in the year 1928 with ""The Passion of Joan of Arc.""",10.0,Anonymous,History
The passion of Joan of Arc - The face of Renee Maria Falconetti,"""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" (1928) by Carl Theodor Dreyer is simply one of the greatest films ever - silent or no silent and what considered by many critics, the greatest performance by any actress on the screen. Renee Maria Falconetti, a French stage performer, was persuaded by Dreyer to play the Maid of Orleans even though she had no film experience. From her very first shot, we can understand what a visionary Dreyer was. The director asked the actress to crop her hair and to strip her face of any makeup. Filmed mostly in close-up, the agonized face of Falconetti's Jean, free of all cosmetic artifice, appears more moving and human, and expresses so many emotions that it literally stays in a viewer's soul.A German designer Herman Warm (""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" and ""The Tree Lights"") constructed the austere sets for the film; the photography of Rudolph Mater also contributed to the films universal power. The composer Richard Einhorn wrote in 1989 the composition ""Voices of Light"" which is included in VHS that I saw and effectively enhances Dreyer's impressive images. With all that said, I couldn't help quoting Ingmar Bergman who said once, ""The human face is the great subject of the cinema. Everything is there"". Faces tell the tale of the Maid of Orleans in this movie, and above all, one unforgettable face - that of Renee Falconetti in her only film appearance.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Beautifully shot work in the art of facial expression,"This movie is definitely worthy of appreciation in terms of the novelty of its movie making technique of its time. I would say it is a difficult movie to make since there is really not much to a story, so Dreyer had to refer to camera angles and closed up shots to evoke emotion.Facial expression of the actors were essential to make it work. Maria Falconetti did a fantastic job in that regard. Even nowadays, I don't think many movies use the camera technique used in this movie. Because of the effectiveness, much of the movie is quite self-explanatory.Although I do appreciate of its artistic quality and like it very much, it is still not one of my top favorite since I am more driven by the literary side of a movie than the photographic side.I saw it only once at this time and much effort were exerted doing so because I wanted to pay close attention to the detail, especially for a silent film in the form of expressiveness instead of storytelling. I'm sure there is strong literary side to it as well. I can feel there are a lot more to this movie than I saw and that requires a multiple viewing, except that I am not ready for a second viewing yet. Still, a must see for at least once.",9.0,Anonymous,History
over-rated but interesting,"It is often said that Maria Falconetti gave the greatest performance in the history of film acting in this movie. That's nonsense. First off, I don't believe anyone can be said to be the single best artist in any pursuit. Shakespeare is not really the greatest playwright to ever live. But now that people keep saying he's the greatest playwright ever no one has the nerve to suggest perhaps he's just one of many brilliant playwrights.As for Falconetti, she gives a rather stylized performance in a very stylized, visually striking, very artsy movie. Her performance consists of a couple of looks, suffering and rapture, and in both she looks a little nuts, although I was never clear if she was supposed to seem nuts.The main power of her performance comes from a sense of pure exhaustion, and from what I hear the directory did everything he could to wear her down, so it may be less a great performance than just watching someone suffer on screen.The movie itself is cool looking but artificial and not that convincing. Those looking to see a truly great performance in a truly great silent movie should check out Emil Jannings in The Last Laugh.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Absolutely stunning,"This is the most stunning film I have ever seen.  I first watched it on a test run where I work and could hardly take my eyes from the screen. (Which wasn't good as I was supposed to be working)  Dreyer's style for this film is unsettling and takes some time to get used to, but is entirely worth it. Movies like this aren't made anymore, nor do I ever expect them to be again. The cast conveys an amazing amount of emotional depth solely with their actions and expressions.  The film is both stark and moving and should be seen by as many people as possible.  It has an interesting history (you don't often hear about lost films being found at the bottom of janitor's closets in mental institutions) and deserves treatment as one of the true works of art of the 20th century.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Part horror movie, part court room drama","The cinematography is top notch - it's what drew me in. I almost want to say it's ahead of its time. The panning shot at the beginning was really nice. The set pieces were well designed. It's very minimalist with its visuals and sets but I think it benefits from it. The haunting score with all the chanting and choir singing sets the tone perfectly. The actress playing Joan has these incredibly expressionistic big eyes. It does kind of get old and stale after a while seeing her cry every couple of minutes. I'll be honest, for the first half of the movie I thought Joan was a mentally unstable person who needed help. Just with the way she always has her eyes open, always crying and the way she behaves. This is a really good movie if you want to study faces and expressions.This movie proves that religion isn't the problem. The problem is the people who are in power in these groups who try to use it for their own self benefit - using fear tactics and lies. It's inspiring how she stuck to her beliefs despite everything that was thrown at her. It was an unjust and unfair assault on a peasant girl whose beliefs transcended those who were trying to persecute her. It's a powerful statement. The movie feels like a horror movie with all of its stark, striking and haunting imagery. It's part horror, part compelling court room drama. It's almost like experiencing a type of purgatory. Definitely not a movie I'd watch again, but I can see its powerful and influential message. Here's the thing: I think movies should be entertaining, exciting and enjoyable. This movie was not that. In fact it was quite unpleasant and not enjoyable to watch. Literally half of the movie was her crying with her big eyes open and the other half was close-up's of ugly guys faces. It's a dark movie that makes you feel isolated and powerless - much like Joan. It left me feeling pretty icky. And I get it - that's the whole point. I just wouldn't watch it again is all. It's almost hard to recommend too because I know it's not for everyone. Take the plunge if you're ready though! Raw score: 7.1/10.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A missed opportunity by a pompous filmmaker,"A number of challenges arise when attempting to produce a film based on historical events. The primary challenge being the decision of whose version of history is to be told. Another of the monumental challenges facing the filmmaker is deciding what resources to use in the design and execution of the film. By the late 1920's, advancements in cinematic equipment and technique were becoming more refined to include many of the basic cinematic innovations that are commonly used today. Careful filtering of different styles over the course of several decades led to these refinements. However, when it comes to methods of creating personal style, there are always those who want to spend time reinventing the wheel or those who decide that they know better than those that came before them. This often leads to artistic revolutions that last a short time before dying out and the art reverts to the basics. This essay will analyze the flaws in The Passion of Joan of Arc in both cinematic composition and narrative construction.Before film, audiences were used to going to plays and seeing the action from one vantage point. As the art of cinematography was developing, filmmakers realized that the action had to stay on the same axis for continuity. This has become known as the 180-degree rule. This is a common rule of axis that allows the audience to orient the characters' relationship to one another regardless of the compositional framing. The Passion of Joan of Arc frequently breaks this rule, which has the effect of disorienting the viewer and giving no firm frame of reference to the geography of the Mise-en-scène nor to the positions of characters. This issue is compounded by the overuse of close ups and washed out background that is bereft of any compositional detail. This was an odd choice considering the overwhelming abundance of magnificent architectural constructs available to those filming in Europe.This film is also hindered in the area of narrative construction. Although the historical figure of Joan of Arc might have been very familiar to European audiences due to her sainthood in 1920, it is no doubt true that some who may view this film might have no firm understanding of the events of the story. The lack of any expositional context is unforgivable even during this early period in cinema. The film opens with the book that supposedly contains the historical transcript of the trial from which the story is based. The text is written in two languages, one of which was swiftly fading from common use by the time of the production of the film. Another flaw in using this document as the basis for a story, which culminates in the burning death of a teenage girl, is the singular perspective of the transcript and the treatment of it as reliable. There exists no counterpoint to this trial therefore no advocacy of the defendant.These issues point out the basic artistic and technical flaws of filmmaking that had been weeded out by most in the industry by the time this film was made. The single redeeming characteristic of this film based on these criteria is the acting. Thompson and Bordwell say, ""Renee Falconetti gave an astonishingly sincere, intense performance as Joan"" (Kindle Loc. 5896) It can be said that the performances in The Passion of Joan of Arc are beyond any negative criticism. However, this sole exception cannot compensate for the overall poor execution of this production. Therefore, it can be argued that had the filmmaker used more fundamentally cinematic techniques, The Passion of Joan of Arc may not have fallen into obscurity only to be discovered in a sanitarium in Oslo back in the 80s.",2.0,Anonymous,History
The Most Spiritually Overwhelming Film Ever Made,"I saw this film for the first time a year ago, and it was such an earth shaking, illusion shattering experience for me, that I have not been the quite the same since.  In fact, it left such an enormous impact on me that I have not been able to see it again since, not wanting to undermine the overwhelming, spiritual epiphany that I deeply felt I had experienced the first time.  A very stubborn and silly attitude, I know, and one which I hope to overcome in the near future, once I come to terms with the infinitely important statements it makes on the very extremes of human nature.The Passion of Joan of Arc is work of art in the truest and purest sense of the term; it is a timeless expression of the eternal human conflict, namely the yearning for the ideal - the spiritual connection which binds all of humankind.  It is a statement without time or place, language or nationality, and set religious system or dogma.  I think that's where the true power of this film lies; in the fact that it concentrates on the exploration of universal human emotions and themes in a simple story, rather then having it's power and timelessness detracted from by an overly complex plot and other timely constructions.Since this is one of my first reviews here, the first two being Tarkovsky's Sacrifice and Nostalgia, I'll arrange my thoughts as much as possible to not make this overlong and gushing.  Just want to comment on certain aspects of this film which particularly struck me.  First of all, was the sense that this was one unified work of art, every element of film working together seamlessly, to form a coherent picture with a unique clarity of spirit, which feels very unencumbered by excess.  The sublime orchestration of music and images overwhelmed me with its poignancy; it was like music for all of the senses, always keeping everything at a high plane of emotion, accentuating the transcendent feeling I had throughout.Falconetti as Joan, as I've heard many times before, is the best performance ever captured on film, hands down.  Even before there was ""method"" acting, she embodied it.  You could feel every emotion she felt, because you sensed she was never holding anything back.  With the whole movie done in closeups, the indescribably expressive quality of her face only intensifies, making her's and your involvement much more personal.It is not only Falconetti's relentless portrait of suffering that comes through to the viewer, but most powerfully, the spiritual glory and triumph which shines through her luminous eyes in the midst of the worst suffering, which shows her pure spirit and the strength of her faith.  That is what most stayed with me about this film, even after the horrifying closing moments of her burning body on the stake.  It was her triumph.",,Anonymous,History

A Film For All Time,"I watched this film in complete silence because I wanted no extraneous input into a film I'd heard so much about. I think that might have been the right decision because I came away with a very high regard for it.First things first: I didn't share the strong sense of anger - that many previews of the film evoked - about the legal and religious aspects of the plot. In fact, I didn't really see the plot as anything more than a subtext (in a literal sense) upon first viewing.The real power of this film stems from the nuances and twitches of Maria Falconetti's face. Gazes clash - baleful against sorrow, defiance against pathic - frequently throughout the film, and it is in these clashes that the film's energy is generated.Maria Falconetti, the lead actress, has been given so much praise over the years that you'd be forgiven for feeling just a little let down at the end... but that is not the case. Even though she is trying to convey raw, deep emotion in tiny segmental bursts, the times where she lapses into the huge trap of over-acting are minimal to none.There were a few times I felt a little surplus from her work, but overall it deducted zilch from her overall performance.This is a strange film - in the sense that it is the human and psychological aspects that overbear any other element. Don't get me wrong, though - considering how old the film is, the cinematography is wonderful throughout. The framing of Maria's face is awesome. So simple yet so forceful.Perhaps this is why, even after all this time, and after all the advances in cinematic technology, the film still punches above its weight: there is no white powder or black eyeliner smeared across Falconetti's face, instead we see natural human skin in all it's porey glory.It's very easy to sum up this film in a short line: it could be *likened* to a sort of Shakespeare of the screen. Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,History

It will give you an endless distaste -- if you don't already have one -- for the likes of Freddie Prinze Jr. Falconetti is simply beyond belief, and it is also fascinating to see one of Antonin Artaud's too-rare screen appearances.

"IT WAS GOOD, BUT I WAS EXPECTING MORE","It's definitely a different movie and that, without a doubt, is always something refreshing and worth mentioning, not only for the story it tells, which is undoubtedly quite interesting and provocative, but also for the way it tells it. Using such close-up shots definitely makes you see the protagonist's brilliant performance; you suffer with her, but it's somehow funny. But I would say that the same style makes it quite monotonous later on because, in general, it doesn't use other types of shots. I also thought that, based on the title, it would be much more explicit in terms of physical violence, but it's more psychological, which isn't bad, but it could have been more explicit. However, in general, at that time, it's not something that was shown very clearly. Good movie, but I expected more.",7.0,Anonymous,History
shades in close-up,"Giovanna is taken to the Inquisition court. Her close-up is worried and pious at the same time. Giovanna in the close-up begins to cry. Then while she claims to be sent by God and the English will be driven out of France, the close-up takes a lateral angle, more painful and sharp as a knife that hits the viewer's heart. The editing alternates impassive close-ups of the inquisitors and the juxtaposition of Giovanna's close-up with the close-up close-up of a guard, which appears zoomed in his terrible look in the car: this is particularly disruptive. The process continues and Giovanna's eyes are estranged as if she were looking at angels and saints for whose vision she is also accused. After the accusation of blasphemy continues to pray in ecstasy as ""The ecstasy of Santa Cecilia"" by Bernini. A friar thinks that Giovanna is a saint, but is taken away by the soldiers. Giovanna sees a cross in the shadow and feels comforted. She is not considered a daughter of God but a daughter of the devil and is sentenced to torture. Giovanna D 'Arco says that even if she dies she will not deny anything. The eyes are twisted by terror in front of the torture wheel and faint. Giovanna is taken to a bed where they are bleeding. Giovanna feels that she is about to die and asks to be buried in a consecrated area. Giovanna says it is not true that she was sent by the devil but that they were sent to make her suffer. In a close-up, Giovanna turns her head in this ascetic and suffering moment and a quick, alternate editing correlates her with close-ups and details of the inquisitors, like their mouth whose words depend Giovanna's life. Giovanna suffers the final sentence while an image of a worm coming out of a skull in the common grave contrasts with the intensity of her close-up. Giovanna embraces death and on the gallows says she accepts death with a good heart. Giovanna burns at the stake while devoted ladies cry in a series of close-ups. The crowd rebels against burning a saint and the soldiers attack the people, who flee in an alternation of close-ups, filming from the top of the crowd that escapes attacked by soldiers and the silhouette of Giovanna burning on the stake.",10.0,Anonymous,History

A Test of Patience,"One could say that this film functions as a sort of 'rite of passage' for art film aficionados. As they say, 'If you can make it through this, you can make it through anything.' However, ""Jeanne d'Arc"" does not function as an overall great film in its own right, at least in my opinion.Honestly speaking, I would have found it nearly impossible to tell whether or not this was a so-called 'great film' had I not seen it on '100-best' movie lists. Certainly, I admire the creative camera angles and other directorial achievements of the film -- in this sense, it is somewhat interesting. However, no one, not even the most pretentious film snob should claim this film is interesting in terms of 'entertainment value.'Now, don't misunderstand me. Great works of art do not 'have' to be entertaining; but, all great works of art are 'fun' for one reason or another. I will explain.First of all, this, of course, depends on one's definition of 'fun.' The most basic, fundamental definition of fun -- mindless amusement -- is not that to which I am referring, though some great films do have this sort of appeal. (All works of art should make their audience think). Rather, the kind of fun I'm referring to is best described as a feast for the senses. One reason why I particularly love ""Citizen Kane"" and view it as my ideal 'great film' is because, if one engages every part of their being as they watch the film, the film will open itself up to them. It comes at its audience from many angles: it is an absolutely hilarious film, a dark film, a frighteningly ambiguous film, etc., depending on the perspective of the viewer.The problem that great films often pose to their audience is that they first REQUIRE that the audience think -- even be willing to suffer -- before they begin to give back in their feasting of the senses. Truly great films give back on one's investment of focus, engagement, and meditation on the film. I just don't believe that ""Jeanne d'Arc"" gives back enough. I can only take so much of Maria Falconetti's exalted expressions before my sense of logic tells me, ""Okay, now! That's enough! I get the idea!"" I feel like nearly half the film is spent staring into her pupils. To some, this might mark greatness; and yes, I admit that it makes the viewer think. But to me, it does not make the film watchable; and ultimately, I do not believe it pays off.These are my thoughts about the film. Sadly, I was expecting to enjoy it. I was ready for another feast of the senses, to have some fun, like with so many other great films; but sadly, this film could serve only as punishment to a sort of 'frenemie,' someone I am trying to wear out or impress via my film knowledge. This is not my version of a great film and it's one of the longest 90 minutes I've ever spent in front of a screen. (2/5)",4.0,Anonymous,History

True Passion and Genius,"This film moved me.
I mean, it really moved me. Witnessing the harrowing tale of this young, brave and feverishly passionate girl through the eye of ingenious director Carl Theodor Dreyer was so much more emotionally touching than just watching a film. It was a religious experience.
There is a fine line between madness and enlightenment. Renée Falconetti's performance brings that raw personage to life with an emblazoned look upon her face of the fervent young lady who has devoted her life to only God and expelling the English from France. Her gaze tells us that only she knows the truths that lie beyond the sight of mortal man and the complexity of her delivery makes it seem as if she also wonders why she should ever be put on trial for that which is an indisputable verity to her. Her gaze alone will grip you and hold you until the film is finished.
The cinematography of Rudolph Maté is astoundingly beautiful. The way the camera surveys the male judges, creeps along the courtroom and stalks the townspeople truly brings the film to life. Joan of Arc often appears in closeup during moments so intense that we see the hope inside her eyes. The motley crew of priests with their politically motivated religious regime always seem to have empty space in every frame alluding to their lack of awareness.
We're there with Joan. We feel for her. We yearn to help her. But she does not want absolution from an unenlightened gang of men who know nothing of her struggles. She only wants the love of God. She shows us how painful it is to know truth and beauty and live in a world that seems to be blind to it.

"If Perfection Exists, This is it!!","Maria Falconetti's performance was life altering. If perfection in acting is possible, Falconetti would be the pioneer of perfection. I saw this movie the other day at an international cinema, having no prior knowledge about the film, just the fact that I love foreign films. I must say, it is now my all-time favorite movie. Period! The movie will stay with you forever. I was not merely watching the trial of Joan of Arc, I was experiencing it.The lack of parallel lines and order in the set design adds to the surreal and nightmarish sensation of being falsely accused. However, Falconetti brings us back to reality from the surreal world with her movements and expressions of despair, hope, anguish, love, faith and devotion. All of which define the human experience. Seeing her on screen was like seeing myself, Falconetti's eyes were a window into humanity. I could feel what she felt, I could see what she saw, and I could understand what she understood. This emotional investment in the film had me in tears the entire time. Never have I experienced a movie like this.Along with the powerful performance by Maria Falconetti (which I could discuss for days) was the incredible music score. ""Voices of Light"" by Richard Einhorn was perfect at setting the mood and helping the audience become emotionally invested in the film. After watching the movie I immediately bought the soundtrack.If you let it, this movie can change your life, as it did mine.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Yes, the people living before 1928 had all the passion, the feelings and the beauty found in our present day society. Now brace yourself, because when Maria Falconetti animates that face in 'Joan of Ark' you'll wish she had continued on in at least one other film in her career. Her unadorned splendor in this film is unsurpassed by any other performance I have ever seen. The sparse geometries of the production set create a 'Picasso like' setting for this church sponsored judgment. Finally, the story is told within the realistic confines of Joan's trial, leaving her warrior past for a different movie script. I recommend this movie.",,Anonymous,History
Excellent idea. mediocre execution,"I'd first like to state this comment is NOT religiously biased, I choose not to follow religion, so I'm not biased towards believing this story or finding it stupid.The story of Joan Of Arc is fascinating to say the least. It shows the prejudice of the religious community both in times long gone and now, and for the twenties, it's quite well filmed.The cinematography is impressive in some areas, but the initial scenes are weak beyond description, the extreme and over-used close-ups becoming tiring and Dreyer's distaste for make-up results in some very unwanted glare from certain actors' faces.But the thing that harmed this potentially perfect film the most is the fact that it lacks sound, had Dreyer waited a few years or attempted to get more or done anything to acquire sound mixing equipment, this film would have been better, the intertitles give the most obvious of the film's dialog and the minor chatter and several important scenes leave to read lips, this kept Passion de Jeanne d'Arc from being the religious epic to end all religious epics.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Tour de Force,"This movie is such an intense experience, and if you are in the mood it can have a lasting impact.There are two sides to this. First there is the intense performance from Maria Falconetti. It almost boggles the mind how well she can portray all shifts in emotion with relatively subtle movements - it is not necessarily a subtle performance, in its intensity, but it recognizes limits. This is no American (or German) melodrama from the 20s, the acting makes the movie come alive. A real Tour de force performance.But then there is the directing and cinematography. It is visionary, honestly, the close-ups not letting up, in combination with interesting camera movements and at times a quick and intense editing style, which adds a kind of nervous atmosphere.It adds more tension to the movie and almost makes you feel trapped like Jeanne was, it is impossible to escape the very small room that is put in the frame.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Going to the Extreme Close-Up,"Here is a film which is easier to understand if you bring some prior knowledge to the viewing; most obviously, it helps if you know who ""Jeanne d'Arc"" (aka ""Joan of Arc"") was, because the film really only shows the last part of her story. It's like watching a stretched out final act of a movie; probably, the intended audience knew about the events preceding the drama. For film viewers not interested in doing homework, but possessing some familiarity with Christianity, it shouldn't be too hard to figure out what is happening. Think of it as a ""second coming"" Jesus Christ story, ""updated"" to a woman in France.The film picks up with Maria Falconetti (as Jeanne d'Arc) on trial for her crimes. Ms. Falconetti is teased and tortured. She is not able to read, and provides little information to the wicked judges. She says she is nineteen years old, ""Je pense,"" elle dit, but looks older. Director Carl Theodor Dreyer films Falconetti almost entirely in close-up. She widens her eyes, and emotes fiercely. It almost looks like a close-up screen test. Falconetti suffers well, responding to the director's commands. But it's hard to tell what she is emoting about; at times, she could be sitting on her toilet. Since she brushes a fly away from her face once or twice; it is likely true this film was made from originally rejected footage, after the original Dreyer edit was ""accidentally destroyed"".That this film is a compilation of outtakes explains (in part?) its flaws in style and storytelling. Although no substitute for the supposedly superior original, this ""La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc"" is worth a look. The director, star, and photographer Rudolph Maté demonstrate some courage and creativity in film-making.******* La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc (4/21/28) Carl Theodor Dreyer ~ Maria Falconetti, Eugene Silvain, André Berley",7.0,Anonymous,History
fabulous = a must see,"Maria Falconetti, almost always in extreme close-up and with no make-up gives a marvelous performance.  She offers a subtlety of expression that is moving in it's realism.  Many say this is THE greatest performance in movie history.  I don't think I could argue. Based on actual trial records. Director, Carl Theodor Dreyer demanded realism in costume, thus the absence of make-up.  Shot mostly in close-up the emotions are intense.  An excellent silent film.  The best I have ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Revolutionary,"'Joan of Arc' is stylistically a key work in the history of cinema, through its combination of close-ups, camera angles, framing and movements of the characters and of the camera on this characters. Dreyer created a masterful visual sequencing with the movements of the heads inside the screen and of camera panning and tilting on these same heads (of the judges of Joan of Arc). This sequencing suggests an inescapable iron encircling of Joan of Arc (whose close-ups were filmed with a fixed camera) by her vicious judges. All these shots created the same effect as that of the painting 'Christ Carrying the Cross' by Jheronimus Bosch, where the serene face of Christ contrasts sharply with the ferocity of the visages in the crowd around him. The camera angles and the decentered and canted framing further accentuate the contrast between Jeanne's face full of grace and the grim facial expressions of her corrupt judges, a bunch of perfidious theologians and dishonest lawyers.The film exposes blatantly the corruption of the Catholic Church, which slavishly defends the English crown and its interests. Instead of trying to stay above the political fray, it prefers to play an active role in a war of succession thereby choosing the interests of the foreign forces instead of those of the native population.The character of Joan of Arc is interpreted sublimely by Maria (Renée Jeanne) Falconetti. Ongoing rumors of Carl Th. Dreyer's misogyny and sadism towards his actresses are contradicted by the testimony of the daughter of M. Falconetti in Torben Skjødt Jensen's documentary 'Carl Th. Dreyer: Min metier'. However, Carl Th. Dreyer put without a shadow of a doubt the quality of his shots and of the final product (his movie) above the fate of his actors and actresses (see the testimony of Preben Lerdorff Rye in the same documentary).With 'Joan of Arc' Carl Th. Dreyer shot an eternal masterpiece. A must see.",10.0,Anonymous,History

I don't have words to describe her intensity, we were a few people watching it and everybody was staggered.A must for all cinema lovers, immediately after I checked her filmography, unfortunately her life was plagued with misfortunes and she died too early, leaving only a few other smaller performances.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Truly haunting...,"A must see even if one is not religious. The visuals in this film are stark and difficult to watch, the feeling of persecution almost causes the audience to cry out in Joan's defense.Maria Falconetti is excellent in the title role, devoid of makeup, wan and parched, she is still beautiful and affecting.Some of the inquisition scenes are noteworthy. The hypocritical religious clerics engineering her demise if she refuses to dress in ""normal women's clothes"" They see this as a threat and insubordinate.This film was shown on silent film Sundays TCM channel. It is every bit as effective in this day, as it probably was at its time. According to Robert Osborne the film was restored when it was found in the closet of a patient in a European asylum.

A classic of the era and a non-traditional portrayal?,"Undoubtedly moving and claiming historical accuracy, Breyer's much lauded but seemingly polarising film provides the silent era with one of its best remembered and highly praised classics. Although the camera work is somewhat erratic, and Falconetti's performance gives out more fear and panic than has been traditionally attributed to this historical figure, the film provides an atmospheric and uncomfortable journey towards a surprisingly harrowing and graphic execution.

Intense!,"While viewing this film on video, I wondered, where are the battles, where is the King, etc.? Then it dawned on me: the Passion of St. Joan. . .. This was a different film, this truly was a film about The Passion as in The Passion of Christ. It was at times excruciatingly difficult to watch due to the incredibly believable, brilliant acting of Marie Falconetti. I was so drawn in by the image of her torment that I often found myself not breathing. The score accentuated the images, and was never overbearing or morose. An unexpected surprise and joy for me was the appearance of Antonin Artaud, the French actor/writer/director who formed his own school of acting. I'd only seen pictures of him and read his books.

The Legendary Falconetti Anchors Dreyer Silent Classic,"I was completely floored when I first saw this movie in the basement of the San Jose Main Library sometime in the early seventies. The mesmerizing performance of Maria (Renée) Falconetti, filmed primarily as a series of brutalizing close-ups, is still the main reason to revisit Carl Theodor Dreyer's austere and claustrophobic 1928 silent film classic about the trial and execution of Joan of Arc. There is little provided in the way of background or context, as Dreyer made an intentional decision to use the original trial records as the basis of his dialogue. Using a minimum of sets, almost abstract in orientation, he uses the camera frame as his canvas by showing the bullying interrogation of Joan by her inquisitors in a series of face shots against a white backdrop. The actors had to use their make-up-free faces as their sole means of expression. There are never any establishing shots, so the viewer never knows where the characters are in relationship to each other. Instead, Dreyer uses dramatic camera angles to convey people's position in the story. As the film builds to its climax, graphic footage of Joan being burned at the stake alternates with sequences of angry French peasants being brutally driven out of Rouen Castle by club-wielding English soldiers. Many of the shots feel abstract and out of proportion to convey a world turned upside down.The overall effect of these creative and daring techniques gives the film a more contemporary feeling than a standard silent, and luckily, adding to the freshness of the treatment is a pristine print found in Copenhagen, the basis of the transfer in this Criterion Collection DVD. An effectively stirring enhancement is Richard Einhorn's beautiful ""Voices of Light"", an oratorio specifically written to accompany the film decades after its release. Falconetti was 35 when she played the 19-year old peasant girl, but she is entirely convincing using her large eyes and facial plains to build her character's spirit as it dwindles under the pressure of the French clergymen who rule her fate. One truly believes her assertion that she is a messenger for God. Never to act on screen again, she gives a truly legendary performance deserving of the hosannas received over the years. The DVD contains an interesting commentary track on which Dreyer scholar Casper Tybjerg provides a wealth of information. It also contains features on the film's unusually stylized production design, Einhorn's music, and the checkered history of the many versions that ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" has gone through over the years. In spite of its unrelenting tone and some scenes that will make you wince, it's a masterwork that still resonates 77 years later.",10.0,Anonymous,History
compelling closeup acting,"I watched the Criterion Collection from an original found in a Norwegian mental institution in 1981. The condition of the film looks crisp and perfect. It is based on the trial transcript of Joan of Arc. The film starts with Joan in prison. The religious authorities question and berate the young girl. They bring her to the torture chamber. At the breaking point, the priest guide her hand in signing a confession. She is eventually burnt at the stake. Renée Jeanne Falconetti stars as Joan. Her big eyes glow with passion. She is a bit old to play the teen martyr. Otherwise, this is an impressive acting performance from the silent era. The constant use of closeups is quite compelling. It's almost a piece of painting or art.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A Powerful Experience Not To Be Missed,"Watching Carl Theodor Dreyer's silent film masterpiece, ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"", is one of the most powerful cinematic experiences you will ever have.  Amazing direction by Dreyer, with extraordinary acting by Maria Falconetti as Joan, enable the viewer to sense every nuance of Joan's ordeal throughout her trial and eventual execution.  The experience is so realistic and overpowering that by the time the fire is lit under her stake, you can practically smell the burning wood.Almost the whole film is a carefully filmed and edited sequence of close-up shots that emphasize every aspect of Joan's plight, and that enable us to share in the deepest of her feelings.  The masterful shot selection takes full advantage of Falconetti's unparalleled performance as she shows us who Joan was.  By keeping everything in close, we never take our attention off of what Joan is enduring, and the intensity of the experience is never allowed to dissipate.After following Joan's lengthy trial and interrogation, the film climaxes with a phenomenal look at her execution.  It cycles through shots of Joan, the stake, her tormentors, and the crowd, and occasionally a shot of birds flying gracefully overhead, overwhelming us with moving sensations.To be sure, this is not the kind of film that casual audiences would necessarily enjoy.  What Joan of Arc endured was an unspeakable combination of systematic humiliation and physical agony, and Dreyer's film makes us feel every bit of it.  And to appreciate fully some of the details in the film, it probably helps to have some basic historical knowledge of Joan's life - the film starts immediately at the trial, with little or no explanation of prior events.  But even if you had no idea who Joan was, watching this account of her would still move you, and you would still come away amazed at her great inner strength - the film is that effective.If you appreciate dramatic cinema, whether you usually like silents or not, make sure to see this masterpiece when you can.",,Anonymous,History
10/10,"Carl Dreyer presents us with one of the greatest tests of an audience in the history of the movies. He forces us to look at Joan's face in a hundred fragmented close-ups, gaze into her steely eyes permeated with God's destiny, never sure of our surroundings. He makes us those that would judge her, gawking at her facetiously. She's the greatest angel we've ever had, and Dreyer doesn't make the mistake of turning her into a device for sympathy: when she bends, it's not because she's weak, it's because she's overcome with God's power. As usual with Dreyer, his film is something that we reflect ourselves onto: are we Joan, or the onlookers? When Joan cries, do we blame ourselves?Individual scenes are captivating: the scene where Joan is tortured in order to confess to lying is one of the tensest in film, and when she gets her hair chopped off it's as if her soul is being hacked away. Dreyer never shows her as a warrior in battle; indeed, he just shows the chaos incited by her death. In terms of silent movie impressiveness, there's a cool scene with blood squirting out when Joan is bled due to her fever, and some jarring cuts to a mother milking her baby. There is a great sense of drama here, as well. The questioning of Joan is often brilliant: How do they know she wasn't hearing the voice of the Devil? She certainly looks possessed. All Joan can say is, ""To make me suffer the Devil has sent you."" Falconetti is magnetic, otherworldly, drained. You can see why she never acted again. Like all true artists, she lets us peer into her soul, and it's frightening. Dreyer uses her magnificently -- through each tear droplet, her soul pushes its way out of her physical body so we can see inside.I personally don't believe she was the daughter of God, or a clairvoyant; instead, I respect that she didn't question herself, only those around her. It's what makes her human: God told her what to do, and since you can't question God, she's not liable. It's that maddening sense of childishness and purity and stubbornness and hypocrisy and a million other things that makes her someone you can't understand, makes her human. It's not so much that we believe she's hearing God as it is we believe that she believes she is. That kind of assurance is, of course, wildly admirable, but at the same time offensive and incredibly dangerous. Worshipping at the altar of Joan is foolish, I think, except for what it represents: trial by fire, and mankind's cynical, relentless attitude, comprised mainly of jaded non-believers. Dreyer's film is great not because it presents Joan as the greatest of martyrs but because it has the courage to show her as simple and human -- and probably as loony as the rest of us. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,History
Brilliantly filmed but with an odd performance by Joan.,"""La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc"" is probably the most famous work of Danish film maker Carl Theodor Dreyer. Unlike the typical biographical film, this one is based completely on the court proceedings in the trial of Joan--not some fictional or semi-fictional story written in 1928. This is pretty wild, as many historical films view truth as very flexible--with the real emphasis being on entertainment. If this means inventing characters or changing history--so be it! But, fortunately, not in this film! It's a history teacher's delight! When the film began, I sure was bowled over by the powerful soundtrack filled with Latin liturgical singing. While annoying normally, here with the intensity of the film and the subject matter is managed to work. In addition, the film is an artistic piece due to the director Dreyer's artistic vision. First, his choices of actors was truly amazing--as he chose some of the most amazing faces I've seen in a film--such character, such intensity and such acting from these people is truly amazing. Plus the camera pulls so much from the actors due to fantastic lighting and clarity of focus--you can even very clearly see the pores on many of the actor's faces! Second, unlike almost all other silent films and even sound ones, this one makes great use of closeups and inventive camera angles to heighten the intensity of the action as well as the impact on the audience. The result is a film that hits you in the face--hard, forceful and impossible to ignore. Especially strong in its impact is the execution itself--Dreyer chose to make incredibly vivid (so much so, some might find it very disturbing).Now I must say that although I greatly admired this, there was, at times, a downside. The actress that played Joan (Maria Falconetti) often looked downright crazed--like she was off her medication and reeeaalllly needed it!! While this could actually be true (after all, she was seeing things and having conversations with dead folks), I doubt if Dreyer wanted his audience to think Joan of Arc was nuts--as she so often appeared in the film. This is sad, really, as at other times, Ms. Falconetti did a masterful job--showing great sorrow and crying most convincingly. But, in many cases, after crying and emoting wonderfully, moments later she was staring off into space like she was stoned. I know this film is considered one of the great films of the silent age, but I don't know how this can be based on the truly bizarre and inconsistent characterization of Joan. Yes, I dare question Dreyer's brilliance in this respect. Overall, there's a lot to love and a lot that makes you question the film's ""classic"" status. Very good...just not great.",8.0,Anonymous,History
My thoughts on this film,"I had never watched a silent movie before today but when I saw this movie listed on cable and saw how old it was, I just had to check it out. I was not disappointed. This film had me hooked. It really showed the ordeal Joan must have gone through and also showed how, in all likelihood, no matter what she said, she was not going to be found innocent. Without one word, and only music in the background, this movie conveyed more feelings than alot of regular movies I have seen. I would recommend this film to anyone who wishes to understand her life, her faith and her amazing courage in the face of such adversity and the obvious hopelessness of her being found innocent. I would definitely watch this again, and again.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The greatest piece of film before Citizen Kane,"I saw it at Cinemateket in Oslo once and I was so captivated by the film that I was stunned for days after I saw it. I saw it with no background music, but when I saw it, I didn't even notice that. The camera work was SO tremendously magnificent, the cutting so exciting and the acting so good, that it passes Sunrise as my favorite silent film, which also made a tremendous impact on me. The extreme close-ups of the faces in the courtroom, the cutting during the torture scene are just two of my personal favorite things about this movie Falconetti's portrait of the french heroine was some of the most wonderful acting in a silent film I've ever seen. It even compares to the great Lillian Gish. I haven't been able to get it on Laserdisc or DVD yet though, but I hope it will be issued.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Passionate and expressive.,"Expressive eyes, tense lips, closed mouth, and the stare that just looks ahead and farther away from the desolate mundanity to settle to the glorious chants of heaven, Maria Falconetti easily and without a doubt gives one of the best performances found in the era of silent film. The Passion of Joan of Arc is one of the most influential French films of its time, and still continues to inspire today. It focuses on the last days of Joan of Arc's life, and dives right into her trial immediately after being captured and accused of being a heretic.Being banned in multiple countries as it was controversial during their time, this film is a strong testament on how far human nature can go, how humanity can easily shift towards ""sides"" depending on number. Likewise, this film is a spiritual experience that explores the idea of faith, and how much sacrifice one can put in just trying to protect or restore one's beliefs. It doesn't show Joan of Arc prior to her days at the trial. It doesn't show her victories, her accomplishments, nor her success in leading the English out of France. Instead, it completely strips her to a character undergoing through a strong crisis as she goes through a questioning of fate that ultimately decides life or death.I have seen the version with music in it (and am currently interested in viewing the completely silent one), and it is truly transcendent. Considering the fact that it was done way back in 1928 impressed me, and the metaphysical journey that this may bring to the viewer—religious or not, may take one to utmost beauty, even up to the brink of tears. Personally, the psychological power of the close-up made me sympathize much more with Joan, and the fact that Falconetti only acted once in her entire life is just stunning. Even without words, Falconetti is still able to display a performance of outright vulnerability while still being confident and at one with God.As per usual with silent films, I still did have some problems with this, and these are more personal ones that I found affecting my entertainment value of the film. As great as this film was, I found this one to be a difficult watch not just because of it's bleak subject matter, but also because of the way it was shot. I do understand the power of the close-up and I actually praised it a while earlier, but for me, using it for most of the film's shots was a mistake. There were barely any background pans or shots to establish the character's placement, so it's quite difficult to follow the location of each, making it sometimes a burden to watch. The wooden transitions between each scene also made everything jarring and dizzying. It's easy enough to forgive the film as it was almost made a hundred years ago, but I found myself occasionally distracted enough to pause the film, which isn't a good thing.In all, The Passion of Joan of Arc is easily commendable because of the technological advancement in film it made during that time, but the low rewatchability and abusive use of close-ups make this a difficult recommendation. Maria Falconetti's passionate performance may still make this film worthwhile, and the influence that this had on preceding films stretches out over many generations, but basing this on entertainment value, this film doesn't really hit the mark and, at times, feels outdated.",6.0,Anonymous,History
La passion de Jeanne d'Arc,"Maria Falconetti is superb as the eponymous tortured soul betrayed and tried for heresy in 15th century France. The history is well known, and Carl Theodor Dreyer sticks fairly faithfully to the more established, traditional, chronology which leaves us, the audience, to focus much more on the wonderfully emotive, gritty and poignant efforts from the cast and the wonderfully creative talent behind the camera. The combination of innovative, intimate and intense photography coupled with the beautifully expressive facial expressions from Miss Falconetti; the subtle but potent brutality of her persecutors - personified well by Eugene Silvain's Bishop Cauchon but also well exemplified by the cold and soul-less panel of judges all make this an effective and chilling film. The score - semi angelic, frequently intimidating but always powerful helps create an atmosphere that genuinely makes you feel fear and trepidation for this young woman, a pawn in things she little understands, but sticking faithfully to her beliefs of divine intervention and pureness of spirit. That emotional link is contagious, and even as a man of little faith myself, I found myself feeling an overwhelming pity for this person caught up in a trap of very much earthly ambition and deceit. It's a tough watch at times, especially as the chronicles remove even the slightest of chances for this woman. It is also pretty short - and that helps keep that momentum moving really well; there is no time for extended and sprawling cinematography to lessen the impact - it's a film about humanity, trauma and fear; and takes some beating...",7.0,Anonymous,History
Joan is played as a mental patient.,"Before I get into the movie it self I must pay my respects to the cinema photographer. Some of the shots are very innovative and unexpected. (1 of of my stars is for this aspect ) Now the movie, well in it self it's not bad but the woman playing Joan is quite obviously playing this part from a person with mental problems. Her never ending bug eyed frightened look and never ceasing crying are just plane irritating.
From what I read about the subject there are those that postulate that she did in fact have a mental disorder hence of 'visions'. Watch this for the photography but you have been warned about Joan!",2.0,Anonymous,History
A seminal landmark for the artistic stylization of French film,"Carl Theodor Dreyer's The Passion of Joan of Arc is a seminal landmark for artistic stylization in French film. The Danish director champions individualism using the persecution of Joan (Renée Falconetti) as a vehicle. This is achieved with the uncompromising use of close-ups, low angle shots, quick cuts and the strong influence of the art movements of the early 20th century.The trial and execution of Joan of Arc is condensed into a single afternoon. This revision serves Dreyer's primary theme of the struggle for autonomy between the individual and society. Joan represents a threat to the status quo and Dreyer plays on this binary opposition. Joan's direct communication with God undermines the rule of the Catholic Church. Traditional gender roles are questioned by Joan's refusal to take off her masculine clothing, thereby refusing to relinquish power to the patriarchal society. Her resistance to signing the written confession brings the church's hypocrisy to surface. The church's mandate is not to prove Joan a heretic, but to stop the spread of her insubordination.To convey Joan's isolation, Dreyer employs a never-ending barrage of extreme close-ups. This unconventional technique serves to heighten the effect of individualism in Dreyer's rendition of Joan. This overuse of the close-up would inevitably falter, were it not for the remarkable performance of Renée Falconetti.Joan's captors are filmed at sharp low-angles, ensuring an unquestionable level of authority. These low angles become increasingly oblique as the tension mounts towards Joan's execution. The result of this extremity is disorienting, creating spatial confusion and uncomfortable monotony for the viewer.Dreyer is unrelenting in his use of fast cuts throughout the film. Touching on elements of French Impressionism and Soviet cinema, these cuts dart between Joan's exasperated close-ups and the austere low-angle shots of the French judges and English guards. The influence of German Expressionism can be noted within the stylized mise en scène. Joan is often disproportionately framed with the crucifix, displayed in the form of barred windows and their resulting shadows.By employing these tactics, Dreyer successfully brings to light the humanity of Joan of Arc. Conversely, her persecutors are convincingly depicted for their insurmountable position of power. The result is an artistically realized silent film that has earned a deserved place in the history of French cinema.",,Anonymous,History

Tearing and cathartic report about every distortions in faith.,"The Tragedy is being consummated. The Passion is reaching its apex. ""You are burning a Saint!"", this is the scream of anguish of the people, witness of this poignant event, very deeply moved by the excruciating agony of Joan of Arc, flame beyond the flame. Very short hair, fine features in spite of her social condition of uncultured peasant, deep and large eyes burning of the same unquenchable fire bound to put an end to her life: this is our heroine, whose beauty is emphasized at once by her great faith in the infinite mercy of God.She never staggers under the heavy burden of her charge in the presence of her inquisitors, unreal and monstrous entities whose hardheartedness shows up on their grotesque features and on their unnatural animal-like attitude, judging by their perverse faces distorted by extremely short focal length lenses. They look like personified devilish entities engaged in a cat-and-mouse game, their ugliness accentuated by a series of uncommon close-ups contrasting with Joan's wonderful face that shows the extreme dramaticity of her situation instead, compelled to endure her pain with great courage and to bear the heavy weight of her cross with resignation, without losing her steady disposition of soul, wanting to go through with her rigidity of principles at the cost of her life.Satanic grimaces, devilish sneers, derisive laughters and spittle emphasize the ineluctable course of this absurd justice system while the vision of her holocaust hovers above the head of the sacrifical victim, so fragile, so vulnerable when fighting in defense of her behavior, so unheard when holding her own opinion, so unprotected when pleading her cause. She objects strenuously to everything they say because faith leads people to do things they never would have imagined themselves capable of, but her passionate words flow away like feeble whispers in a windy day, while her enchanting eyes scan an invisible sky, looking for something beyond her human strength, beyond every possibilities of the common mortals, maybe a divine sign from above, even if there's no question about her unshakable devotion to God, because ""God knows where He bring us"", she thinks, ""but we are able to know the road to Him only when we reach the end of it."" Every sequences are included in the above described oppressive scenario whose hypnotic suggestion expressionist style reminds us of the universal sense of pain ready to penetrate deeply into the substrate of our Christian and human consciences, in the inmost recesses of the soul, sharing our hidden emotions awakened by the vision of a defenseless face appealing for mercy in vain, without never losing her dignity.Joan, of Arc, splendidly played by Renée Falconetti in this ""PASSION"", might be considered the symbol of the eternal suffering of human beings, adorned with an aureole of beauty and holiness, set on a supreme pedestal, higher and higher than every other female characters of the history of cinema, namely the ideal heroin per antonomasia especially thanks to the heart-rending final purification, moving and endless journey around the deep black of human soul, around the meanders of a faith itinerary stranded for ages on the sand-banks of a devastating fanatic pragmatism.

Her close-ups can be heartbreaking.Dreyer's use of the close-up was novel from what I've read (I'm more of a Hitchcock scholar).

An undeniable masterpiece,"What Dreyer has achieved with Le Passion De Jeanne D'Arc is nothing short of miraculous. Indeed, it is a miracle in itself that we are able to witness the brilliance of this film, as the original negative of it was destroyed in a fire. A second negative, re-edited by Dreyer from alternate takes was also thought lost to a fire. Then in 1981, after more than half a century, an original danish copy was discovered in a Norwegian mental institution, allowing us to view the film probably very close to its original form.Dreyer was a master of portraying human emotion, and this film shows his artistry at the peak of his form, elevating him to the great pantheon of auteur's. In a very unorthodox technique, Dreyer refused to cast actors for the roles in this film, and refused to let anyone wear make-up, jewellery or facial enhancing products of any kind. He wanted to show humans in their simplest form, stripping them of all made up beauty, revealing our primitive emotions with true transparency, in order to display the delicate subtleties of our features and emotions. The relentless close ups in the film allow us to observe every flutter, every quivering lip and tear rolling down the cheek, displaying the aesthetic beauty of the human expression, using our faces as a window on our soul. Some silent films can be hard to watch, however like Murnau's masterpiece Sunrise (1927), these detailed human displays of feeling and suffering transcend any message that could possibly be spoken or written, and reveal endless levels of character interpretation.Although this film goes into a lot of detail on Joan's devotion to Christianity, I don't think that it would take away from the experience for someone without strong beliefs. I am not a particularly religious person, however this film touched me in a way that only few films can. I found the realisation of Joans suffering and emotional torment almost unbearable at times, however the film, although deeply sad, left me feeling so very blessed.

"Beautifully made, but tough to watch.","Silent films are always a challenge for me, because there needs to be something compelling in the way the narrative is presented that draws me in since I don't have some of the more traditional things I cling to in a modern movie. For this reason, most of my favorite silent films are comedies, because physical humor translates without anything spoken. I was quite worried when I started The Passion of Joan of Arc because it felt like so much of the movie was intertitles. With silent films I feel there is a tipping point where too many title cards start to pop up and my brain begins to think ""Maybe I should just read a book on this subject, because they don't seem to be utilizing the visual medium of film as much as they are just showing expository text."" Thankfully, this didn't last long. It seems the early scenes are designed to set up the narrative, so that the visuals can do the story-telling the rest of the way through. In fact, at one point I was wishing for a title card (to spell out the words in the note she is asked to sign) and they didn't give me one.I was certainly impacted by the story of The Passion of Joan of Arc, because it is a great historical tale of injustice and martyrdom. You can't avoid feeling sympathy for her character, particularly since about half the film is just close-ups of Maria Falconetti staring into the middle distance in different states of sorrow, shock, and horror. This makes it almost impossible to escape the emotion of the events unfolding, because we are forced to watch the toll it is taking on this poor woman. The constant conniving of the religious leaders overseeing her trial is devastating, and I suspect a bit mild compared to the way this thing actually unfolded in 1431. In many ways it reminded me of films I've seen about the trials of Jesus prior to his crucifixion, and it elicited a similar emotional reaction from me. That being said, while I was impacted by The Passion of Joan of Arc, and I recognize some of the wonderful film-making, it wasn't exactly my cup of tea. It is so depressing, and the endless shots of her teary eyes were hard to take. It's a film I feel appreciative I've seen once, but I can't say I'd want to see it again.",6.0,Anonymous,History
silent masterpiece,"Oak Cliff Film Festival 2018
Greetings again from the darkness. It's a rare treat to watch a 90 year old silent movie. Especially in a remastered format. Especially on the big screen. Especially at a historic theatre. Especially with a nearly packed house. And especially with a live score! The 7th annual Oak Cliff Film Festival, held at the Texas Theatre (opened 1931), afforded just such a treat with its Friday evening screening.Most know the story of Joan of Arc (Jeanne d'Arc), a teenage heroine of France for her role in the Hundred Year War. She claimed that she received spiritual and religious guidance through voices and visions. Once she was captured by English allies, she was charged with heresy and burned at the stake in Rouen in 1431. A quarter century later, the Pope declared her a martyr and she became a symbol of France - canonized as a saint in 1920. Of course, here the story is as much about the film as it is the martyr and historical figure.The eyes are what first grab our attention. The eyes of actress Maria Falconetti as Joan of Arc. It was Falconetti's only screen appearance, and though she spent the rest of her career on stage, this role cemented her place in cinematic history. Without the benefit of sound and voice, the silent era performer had to emote through eyes, facial expression and body movement. Few ever did it better than Falconetti. It's gut-wrenching to watch the church counsel attempt to break her resolve. Our minds hear the intensity of their voices though we only read the subtitles.Renowned Danish filmmaker Carl Theodor Dreyer directs the script from writer Joseph Delteil (taken mostly from the transcripts of the trial), and the cinematography is through the eye of 5 time Oscar nominee Rudolph Mate' (FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT, PRIDE OF THE YANKEES). It's impossible not to notice a style so different from modern day filmmaking. The harsh lighting and almost exclusive use of close-ups and medium shots bring an immediacy of which we aren't accustomed. The single piece set is quite unusual and provides a stage aura. Another thing that stands out is the editing style. Continuity of scene wasn't important here. What mattered was the sense of frantic pacing and over-bearing stress brought on by the rapid-fire questioning. We share the claustrophobic feeling with Joan, though of course, we know where this is all headed.As part of this special showing, the Oak Cliff Film Festival arranged for a live score performed by composer George Sarah, a 4 piece chamber orchestra, and a vocal group accompanying the music.Perhaps this meant even more to me since I visited Rouen last year, and the lasting legacy (almost 600 years) of this courageous young woman is evident throughout much of France. The re-mastered film is stunning to look at, and even more historically important knowing that the film had long thought to be lost to a fire. The story and the film are quite something to experience.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A fantastic film.,WOW! What a fantastic movie. This is truly one of the great pieces of silent cinema. Maria Falconetti is amazing as Joan of Arc. Flawless direction from Danish director Carl Th. Dreyer. A must-see motion picture from the silent era of film.,7.0,Anonymous,History
"Yes, It's as Good as You've Heard","It's always dangerous to track down a film you know nothing about, simply because the reviews are so overwhelmingly positive.  That's the trap I fell into here...but this movie did not disappoint.  A haunting, powerful film...with a larger-than-life performance by Renee Falconetti. From the first time you lay eyes on Falconetti, you realize that you're in for something special. I have never in my life seen an actor/actress express more emotion...with or without dialogue.  Falconetti demands your complete attention as she captures the martyr's torment beautifully.  A recent review on imdb claimed this film is depressing.  This may be true...but in a thoughtful way.  No, Dreyer doesn't explicitly *tell us* if Joan truly is a Saint.  The film would have been greatly diminished if he had.  But after watching the entire film, I think Dreyer's feelings on that matter are made very clear.  Bottom line: I'm not a big fan of silent movies, but I highly recommend you view this film.  And it's not just for ""art"" types, but anyone looking for inspired film making.  The DVD also includes Richard Einhorn's ""Voices of Light,"" music inspired by the film.  I find that this choral and orchestral work adds greatly to the film's impact.  Go find this movie...now.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Epic and Impressive!,"I think this film is one of the most impressive films of silent cinema. The actress, who played the role of ""Jeanne d'Arc"", performed at a high level. Although the film is silent, the orchestral music playing in the background increases the power of the film. One of the main points that make the film legend is the use of a camera. Close-up is often preferred. These close-up scenes are like a cinema course. The camera angles used in the film are very brave and the reference point for someone who will learn the camera angles today. It was the right choice to tell not the whole life of her, just a small part of her life. It is impossible for even a stranger like me to be impressed while watching this film about a French and Christian cultural figure like Jeanne d'Arc. For those of you who don't know, I suggest you find out who Jeanne d'Arc is before you watch the film.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A film so heartbreakingly realistic and brutally honest it might even bring tears to your eyes,"Part of what makes The Passion of Joan of Arc so bold and unflinching, for its time and its current state in cinema, is, much like its titular subject, how battered, beaten, and kicked around it has been in order to get where it is today. This is a film that, from its very inception, was a controversial subject that clerical authorities didn't want to be seen by a wide audience, for its portrayal of religion and politics. Nonetheless, writer/director Carl Theodor Dreyer pushed forward in a direction for a film on Joan of Arc that detailed the gap between religion and politics, in addition to insights into the complex of the fragile male ego that boasts assimilation and manipulation. After the completed and finalized print was lost in a fire, it was doubtful that a print even close to the original would ever resurface until one was discovered in a mental institution in Oslo, Norway in the 1980's. After some cleaning up and polish was added, the film was restored into an eighty-one minute cut, which is said to be very close to the original film's length and structure.Dreyer's focus in The Passion of Joan of Arc was precisely what the title suggests; an intimate and often harrowing portrayal of the agony the French heroine (played ever-so tenderly by Renée Jeanne Falconetti) endured following her unfair trial after the Hundred Years' War. Dreyer sees no point or purpose in showcasing sweeping battle sequences nor does he see it fit to detail Joan of Arc's story in a series of ""greatest hits"" moments that ultimately ends in a corrupt sentencing. Instead, Dreyer places us, the audience, in an awkward position throughout; we are practically voyeurs into the trial and sentencing of Joan of Arc, who we witness subjected to enough physical and mental torment to shatter one's entire self-worth. As she takes a stand for her faith and her beliefs of her own personal sainthood and relationship with God, she is bludgeoned and abused by an all-male jury and various authorities before being sentenced to death by being consumed by fire.The Passion of Joan of Arc can be viewed in two basic forms; in its original form, with no dialog, or a modified, Criterion Collection version that adds accompanying orchestration from Richard Einhorn called ""Voices of Light"" (which was my audio-track companion) throughout the film. Einhorn's score provides well-timed parallels in sound and musicality to events transpired on-screen, and the symphonic blend of instruments at various times adds to the cacophony of emotions and tones throughout the picture in a way that wouldn't be as impacting, I feel, with an empty audio-track. Dreyer's film has far too much potential for impact to be viewed in complete and utter silence.Dreyer's decision to focus largely on facial expressions and the facial personalities of characters almost overshadows the complex work of his and Rudolph Maté's in the cinematography department. At the time of its release, The Passion of Joan of Arc erected one of the most expensive and immaculately detailed film sets in the history of cinema, with its construction of the famous Rouen Castle taking most of Dreyer's seven million franc budget on the film. Having said that, the detail in the background of the film is almost as important as the detail in the foreground, with hulking walls and set architecture towering over the characters in the film like a bitter and obvious presence. The walls are nothing more than helpless witnesses to the atrocious treatment of a very confident woman; so confident she makes her male counterparts squirm with inferiority and fear.Out of eighty-one minutes, probably a good forty or forty-five are Dreyer's camera lingering and depicting the facial and emotional reactions of Joan of Arc. Dreyer allows us to zero in on Joan of Arc's emotional responses as a way of peeling back the events of this film and revealing a tender, more human side that can often get lost in the shuffle. This is also likely why Dreyer forgoes the conventional battle sequences the Hundred Years' War practically loans itself to on film; it doesn't work to detail the kind of grounded human interest in the film.Finally, there's the concept of male ego that Dreyer subtly explores here. Consider how manipulated Joan of Arc becomes shortly after allowing herself to be tried for blasphemous remarks about her alleged sainthood and her relationship with God. Her trial was never intended to be fair, but instead, a circus for masculinity to triumph over a defenseless woman who was never going to be heard out on anything she had to say. As a result, the males of the court room decide to shame her, cutting off all her hair and physically and mentally abusing her in a barbaric manner that shows little else besides dominance over the meek and powerless in a cruel situation.The result is a heartbreaking film that grabs you with an all-too-real depiction of a time period frequently obscured by the lingo of textbooks and droll college lectures thanks to Dreyer's human approach and intimate focus on facial expressions and steadfast realism. It's only fitting that The Passion of Joan of Arc endured such a brutal life trying to gets its message out to a wide audience; it perfectly replicates the struggle and fight of its titular character.Starring: Renée Jeanne Falconetti. Directed by: Carl Theodor Dreyer.",9.0,Anonymous,History
there is no better film to begin a serious study of film,"The Passion of Joan of Arc, especially with the addition of Einhorn's score, is the best film I can imagine using as an introduction to film study. As a student/occasional-teacher of film studies, I tend to watch for all sorts of technical details and usually end up intrigued by films far more often than ""moved.""Viewing this film is considerably different for me. It's something of a truism now that this is one of the best-acted, most emotive films ever created, and I couldn't agree more, which is why using this film to begin thinking about the myriad issues in film studies seems ideal.On the most basic level, there is a wealth of topics related to symbolism and semiotics (silent films ""speak"" entirely in visual signs). There is also, as many others have pointed out, a use of camera angle and shot framing that is emotionally and narratively powerful, but also seems stylized to contemporary viewers, thereby simultaneously drawing viewers in and allowing a critical distance for examination of the technique.The addition of Einhorn's score makes this film a wonderful case study in theories of textuality, textual authority and discourse theory. The various theories of authorship (Foucault's ""what is an author?"" and Barthes' ""Work/Text"" seem particularly applicable) can be studied at length considering that Dryer is not around to consult about the addition. Einhorn's libretto also raises a number of questions about the relationship between Dryer's film, the other stories of Joan of Arc (explored on the Criterion DVD), Biblical text and the female mystics. Biblical exegesis, textual criticism, semiotics and psychoanalytic theory can all be brought together to elucidate some of the most urgent questions any text can ask: what is the nature of humanity? What is the human relation to (a)god? What are the political/religious/ethical ways gender is dealt with? (or performed?) What is jurisprudence?Usually, I would try to separate each of these inquires into film, if for no other reason than I know of few texts are both intellectually AND emotionally complex enough to support such a thorough inquiry without boring students. I'm not sure that this film could ever become ""boring.""I can recommend to film more highly than this one, especially to beginning students of film.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A must for film lovers!,Saw this on one of the classic movie channels and was astounded. If only there were actresses that could come close to Maria Falconetti.

The best film I've seen in the year 2000,"I am selecting this french silent film as my initial user comment contribution to the IMBD. Viewing an average of 300-400 films yearly,I seldom discover a masterwork of cinema as ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"". Dreyer's astounding directions, encompassing fluid camera movements and rapid editing techniques, are progressive for the era. Falconetti's intensive facial reactions appropriately convey bewilderment during the early investigation sequence, anxiety when faced with torture, and atonement in her final hour. Populated with an assortment of authentic faces, the motion picture transports one to the time period depicted. It is this documentary-like achievement which grants itself to the film's greatness. The fact that the script is based on the actual transcipts, leaves me to assume a high level of historical accuracy, something lacking from Besson's recent version. The print, seen on a videotaped TCM showing, was accompanied by an inspired music score which accentuates the imagery. I think the film is important in the history of cinema, and I look forward to viewing Dreyer's ""Vampyr"" and ""Day of Wrath"". 4 out of 4 stars",,Anonymous,History

A silent film that speaks volumes (Criterion's Voices of Light version),"What a beautiful and yet startling movie. I am currently watching it on TCM (Turner Classic Movies). It's outstanding, from the acting and cinematography to the words and music (""Voices of Light,"" performed by Anonymous 4 which was composed by Richard Einhorn who was said to have been inspired by the movie). This is a gem that needs to be seen by real film buffs (who would opt to view the film without sound, as director Carl Theodor Dreyer preferred) and current directors and producers. When I first began viewing it, I thought it had been filmed very recently. All the techniques used, from the placement of lights and cameras to the intimate close-ups of the faces of actors are stunning, almost shocking. As a still photographer, I feel the camera work by Rudolph Mate is tremendous -- there were angles used during the filming of the 1928 movie that still aren't used today. It's so powerful yet also unsettling; even with today's cinematography, Rudolph Maté's lens forced the viewer to see the pain up close, the insensitivity of the judges and guards... Maté's compositions must have been kept off-center to give the viewer a sense of imbalance. And when the film climaxed, camera movements rocked back and forth, or were swept upside down and even trampled on.I wish I could have watched the making of ""La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc,"" to see how the film crew and actors developed the movie. Word is that Dreyer insisted that no one wear makeup, which was unheard of in the making of movies in that time. He apparently was also obsessed with being factual and wound up relying on actual transcripts of the church trial. I am glad this movie has been released in video. Please, be sure to at least view this film with the ""Voices of Light"" music track, if not purchase it. I strongly recommend it, over what I recently saw in what may be the original music, a simple piano track. That version left me rather underwhelmed.I had to save the best for last: actress Maria Falconetti. She never made another film from my understanding.

Profoundly Faithful. Spellbindingly Hypnotic. Hauntingly Overwhelming. One of the best films ever!,"Finally got round to see, ""The Passion Of Joan Of Arc"" yesterday night.One word sums this film up, Woah!This deeply spiritual film conjured up an indefinable state of breathtaking hypnosis, I sat spellbound and dumbstruck by film's end. I actually felt like an unstruggling insect caught on an entangled web of anesthetically luring movie magic. ""TPOJOA"" certainly now ranks as a shining example of cinema's suggestive power to touch and stimulate, to incite and inspire.On closer scrutiny, an intoxicating religious fervor was so expertly woven into the film's tapestry, it was inevitable that I too was swept up by the tumultuous mood swings and intense emotional momentum of this sensational work. Truth be told, I even felt like watching the whole film again to relive the cocooning comfort of this strangely uplifting experience. For the record, I was never this psyched up by an `old' film before, much less a silent one.Of course, not to put a slight on Carl Dreyer's masterful direction, one single galvanizing element that held this film together was unarguably, Falconetti. This woman (reportedly having only acted in this one film) deserved every single critical accolades thrown her way.Her face, those piercing pair of eyes, every twitch and every grimace, haunted me in unimaginable ways. With nowhere to hide my arrested gaze, that extra-terrestrial face miraculously leapt out from its screen confines and stabbed me right where it hurt. It was not pretty. I was a rubble of my former self by film's end. It was like I surrendered my senses like a willing captive, overdosing on this woman's internalised angst and suffering, till my mouth frothed and my eyes bled.Okay, melodramatic gushings aside, being more of an ""atheistic leaner"" myself, even I have to admit that the intensity with which Falconetti portrayed Joan of Arc's religious piety to God and her calling was shatteringly convincing. Viewed within the context of its filmscape, those ""clothed"" men and sundry characters during the trial must surely have been blind (or sinisterly evil) to not be touched by such enveloping sincerity.On a more introspective note, I was much astonished by this film's uncanny power to challenge my intellectual conviction. To claim that it did not even manage a superficial gnaw at my unwavering existential beliefs on that ""fabled"" man upstairs will be a complete disservice to the film and most importantly, to myself.As such, not wanting to cap my exploratory swing in the great spiritual pendulum, I shall opt (for now), to appreciate this film on a purely secular level. Though this film did not completely convert my anchoring beliefs in the wonders of universal nothingness, it did expand my myopic view on mankind's struggle with something as abstract as faith and spirituality.Most importantly, I did just witness a great, great film, whatever its religious underpinnings or however potent its persuasiveness. Consider this then, my highest compliment for ""The Passion Of Joan Of Arc"".",10.0,Anonymous,History

Breathtaking Performance in a Religion-Based film.,"Watching a silent film made in the 1920s could be a jaded adjustment for people that are used to the storytelling methods of today, let alone one that abandons a score to aid the visuals. The Passion of Joan of Arc does exactly that, but with a purpose; the filmmakers want to explore a play by play of Joan of Arc's trial without inflicting their opinion onto the film. They urge us to draw our on conclusions on the happenings of the events. In their attempts of doing this, trying to connect with the character of Joan as a protagonist is difficult.The film may have troubles identifying its heroine to the audience, however, the actress portraying the religious figure, Maria Falconetti, bares her soul through the eyes of the character. Never has authentic emotion been more present in a character than in it is Joan. Falconetti creates a stabbing ache in your stomach as you see the pain Joan has survived though and the state of fear she currently lives in.Her performance is most famous for her glaring eyes that stare into space in what feels like every scene. My explanation for Falconetti's exaggeration is Joan's interaction with God (unseen in the film) was so overwhelming, it clouded her view of the world. Now every minute of her life, she sees those images of Him. It's a breathtaking performance that deserves to rank among the best in film history.Carl Theodor Dreyer's mission to create something with is personal stamp of originality is found with The Passion of Joan of Arc's jumbled camera angles. He has thought up each cut, where the camera is placed, and how it contributes to telling this story. We, the audience, are just around to observe what's happening, we're not supposed to feel like a part of the history being told. It's usual editing for such a film.The Passion of Joan of Arc is a religious-based film with a performance that will live on with Joan of Arc's legacy. The Passion of Joan of Arc is uncommon, and should be experienced. It gives Joan of Arc the credit as a Jesus-counterpart in the eyes of God, something that may not be understood to even deeply religious people prior to seeing the film.Rating: AGrade: 9",,Anonymous,History
Made me rethink what silent cinema could be,"This silent French drama from writer-director Carl Theodor Dreyer depicts the trial and subsequent execution of Joan of Arc, the 15th century warrior and religious icon. Her trial is fraught with political intrigue and the outcome is virtually preordained, yet she transcends her grim future and achieves spiritual grace. It stars Maria Falconetti, Eugene Silvain, Andre Berley, Maurice Schutz, Antonin Artaud, and Michel Simon.I can still recall the first time I watched this and being absolutely floored by it. The movie's artistry made me rethink my idea of what silent cinema could be, and the performance by Maria Falconetti remains one of the greatest ever committed to film. Dreyer's emphasis on close-ups is jarring and unconventional for the time, and his choice of terrific faces is one of the movie's many highlights. Most of these performers are not the typical handsome gentlemen or Hollywood cuties one expects, but rather they are aged, fleshy, wrinkled, spotted, even downright ugly, and they imbue the proceedings with more weight and character. The film's finale is still one of the most moving and disturbing sequences of its type.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Simply devastating,"In ""The Passion of Joan of Arc,"" Carl Theodor Dreyer elects to tell the story of Joan's trial not through action or dialogue (or title cards, as this a silent film), but through faces. His simple but mesmerizing technique is to place the actors in rooms with stark white walls, film them in extreme close-up, and assemble the film by alternating images of Joan with those of her interrogators. The bare white set contrasts with the actors' faces, which are filmed in such detail that their flesh almost becomes tangible, and reveals everything you need to know. The craggy, warty faces of Joan's interrogators suggest human menace and evil, without the actors ever assuming an overtly menacing expression.Renee Maria Falconetti, playing Joan, is required to go through the entire film with the camera focused tightly on her bare face as it registers all the infinite nuances of anguished but steadfast faith. Tears often roll down her cheeks, yet she never forces them out of her by sobbing, or tries to hold them back by closing her eyes. The openness of her face, the involuntary flow of her tears, help establish Joan's saintliness: it feels as though she suffers and weeps not for herself, but for the whole world. The moment when Joan, alone in her cell, realizes that she must become a martyr, is an extraordinary piece of acting.Famous theater director and theorist Antonin Artaud appears here as a young, compassionate monk. At first I thought it ironic that the founder of the ""Theater of Cruelty"" should play one of the least cruel characters in the movie; however, after doing a little research on Artaud, I noticed similarities between his theories and this film. Artaud wanted theater to be an intense, cathartic, spiritual experience, relying on emotion and gesture rather than text, using physical means to achieve a metaphysical purpose. I can think of no better summation of ""The Passion of Joan of Arc,"" than to say that it is the cinematic equivalent of this. Its almost ritualistic evocation of pure suffering produces an emotional effect that few other films achieve.",10.0,Anonymous,History

This is a masterpiece that breaks all sorts of filmmaking conventions that are rarely broken even today. In fact, the breaking those conventions are what make this film as great as it is.It must be stated the feat that Dreyer pulled off in a technical and story sense. The Passion of Joan of Arc solely centers around Joan of Arc's trial and execution, not the battles and wars, but the trial itself. It's a dialog-driven courtroom drama told without sound. It is almost nonstop talking and there are very few title cards, yet you completely follow everything that is going on and said, even if you can't read lips or don't know the language. It's almost all close-ups without any establishing shots of peoples' faces. On top of that, the only surviving version of this film was created from the film's outtakes by Dreyer because the original version was banned, and from the outtakes, it's STILL one of the greatest film ever made, arguably the greatest ever.This isn't just a movie, this is way beyond that.

Faces,"Regarded as one of the classics of silent cinema, ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" (La passion de Jeanne d'Arc) is a cinematic portrayal of the trial of Joan of Arc and her execution. Directed by the lauded Danish director Carl Theodor Dryer the film is an exercise on expression and its effect on the viewer. Shot in a unique style of highlighting the actors' faces with continuous close-ups the film is quite the assault to the senses as one facial exclamation after another bombards the viewer. Lead star Maria Falconetti is the focus as she enunciates every ounce of expression on her face. Whether it be single-dripping tears, soaring joy, or yearning hope her highly dramatic acting leaves an impression as her creaking head motions and restrained emotional volatility subtly stamp their mark. Dreyer shows his lofty reputation with the consistent acting throughout with the far from aesthetic visages of the church persecutors convincingly depicting their ugly oppressiveness and Falconetti's adept immersion into the victim's parlous state. Alas, with all these attributes and novelties none of them work. The lack of perspective and the minimal, stage-like set limit the work creating a tunnel vision atmosphere of endlessly wearying tedium. I dozed off and zonked out throughout the flick ""missing"" scenes and dialogues altogether. This would have benefitted from a traditional style of filmmaking or as a short or both. As a bonus being a literary fan it's good to see once again Antonin Artaud in a prominent role the strange and tragic author showing to posterity he could act.

An Indisputably Authentic Art-piece,"This film is a highly emotional document of the final conflict between the eventually sainted 'heretic' Joan of Arc and her interrogators, and Joan d'Arc's subsequent burning at the stake in the 15th century...(1437, I believe)1.) By utilizing the actual manuscripts of the trial and Mlle. Rene Falconetti's empathetic talents, Dreyer quite possibly distilled the account of the incident to its authentic emotional content.2.) The pitch is established through eyes, nose and mouth of Falconetti and by the arrangement of the others around her - before her, accusing; beside her, questioning; one alone, despairing; behind her, whispering.3.)

A contender for THE movie of the 1920s,"As much as I did love Metropolis, The Gold Rush and Faust(1926), The Passion of Joan of Arc is a contender for the movie of the 1920s, that's how amazing it is. It is an incredibly well made film, it draws on artistic styles from the Renaissance through to the avant-garde and with all the symbolic angles, zooms, tilts and pan shoots the photography is spellbinding and captures the authentic costumes, sets and scenery wonderfully.The Passion of Joan of Arc is also a very haunting film, as what it does have is an atmosphere that is so genuine and unsettling. It is beautifully directed by Carl Th Dreyer, and the story based on trial records is highly compelling and genuinely dramatically intense in its action. Other than the atmosphere and visuals, what makes The Passion of Joan of Arc is the lead performance. Sincere and personal, Maria Renee Falconetti is absolutely astonishing.All in all, amazing and dare I say a milestone not only of its decade and genre but of film in general. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,History
It's a shame silent films are rarely shown anymore,"Groningen's movie scene is always up to unusual and interesting things. I've seen La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc in a church (Martinikerk), with an organ and a latin choir providing the music to this silent film.Jeanne d'Arc is played very emotional though very convincing by Maria Falconetti. Jeanne d'Arc was her only performance as an actress, but you can't see she hasn't done any acting before. She sighs, weeps silently and gazes beyond her questioners. You see her eyes wide open and staring into nothing. She does it all the time, and it might get a little irritating in the end.The other actors too, are very good. Their looks perfectly match their characters, and in the many many close ups you can see through them by just looking at them. Very useful, because a lot of their dialogues do not appear in text screens.Despite of a perfect Jeanne d'Arc and a very good crew of judges, clerks, priests and soldiers, the Oscar for best performance goes to the camerawork. Long and intense close ups, very modern framing and a few shots you can also find in Soderbergh's Traffic.La passion de Jeanne d'Arc is a story with a very predictable ending: she dies. But it takes long before she finally gives up and I believe director Dryer has stretched the story a little too much.It was a wonderful experience to watch a silent film in a church, accompanied by organ music and a choir. But even without those extra's, La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc is a very worthwhile, if not a beautiful movie. It's a shame silent films are rarely shown anymore.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Movie Odyssey Review #022.1: Passion of Joan of Arc,"022.1: Passion of Joan of Arc (1928) - released in Denmark 4/21/1928, viewed previously.DOUG: We watched this silent classic a couple of years ago when we became interested in how historical figures, warriors in particular, are portrayed in the movies. This entry was part of a trio of films featuring Joan of Arc (the others starring Ingrid Bergman in 1948 and Leelee Sobieski in 1999). We watched this one last, and it's definitely the best of the three. Those wondering about the title may assume correctly: Mel Gibson took the same approach to Christ in his film Passion of the Christ as this film takes to Joan: The last part of their life leading up to their famous public execution. When one talks about this film, the discussion really has little to do with what happened to Joan herself; it's more about the unique, disorienting way the film is shot, lit, edited, and acted. The director isn't really interested in teaching the audience about Joan; her trial is just the setting for this little head trip. The whole thing is very disorienting; in the courtroom scene, you're not allowed a sense of where each character is sitting or how the room is laid out. Dreayer wants to immerse you in what's happening. Much of the film's strength also lies in the performances of the cast, particularly Maria Falconetti in her only film role. This is an essential piece of silent film history, which was winding down at this point in time.Last film chronologically: Speedy (1928). Next film chronologically: Steamboat Bill, Jr. (1928).The Movie Odyssey is an exhaustive, chronological project where we watch as many milestone films as possible, starting with D.W. Griffith's Intolerance in 1916 and working our way through, year by year, one film at a time. We also write a short review for each and every film. In this project, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the time period, the films of the era, and each film in context, while at the same time just watching a lot of great movies, most of which we never would have watched otherwise.",9.0,Anonymous,History

A film historic milestone with low entertainment value,"From today's perspective, it's hard to watch this film. Compared to Buster Keaton or Charlie Chaplin, who shaped an era with humor and wit, this film is primarily dramatic and tells an intense story. The highly praised film mainly relies on close-ups, where the faces of the characters resemble individual paintings. This aspect is worth highlighting.

The one thing everyone should know about this movie is...,"That the script was based on the transcripts of the actual trial of Jeanne d'Arc in Rouen in February and March of 1431. The same is true of much of George Bernard Shaw's play, ""Saint Joan.""There is no question that the film would be powerful even to anyone who had never heard of Joan of Arc. It is impressive in every way-- the structure, the camera-work, the acting (Maria Falconetti is extraordinary), even the fact that make-up wasn't used, which heightens the brutal reality of her story.But the most astounding thing is the script. I can't think of another *silent film* with a script this important and memorable. All it takes is one look at the original trial transcripts to understand why both Dreyer and Shaw relied on them. Joan's intellect is impressive, as is her faith, which embraces all that is good about Christ's teachings. In contrast, the ignoble church interrogators ask questions that expose the shallow hypocrisy of the corrupted Roman Catholic hierarchy-- blind, self-serving, intolerant dogma that is still evident among too many passionate Christians today.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The Passion of Joan of Arc,"To ensure King Charles rise to the throne, supported by the apparently divine guidance given to Joan of Arc, is discredited, the captured Joan must be found guilty of heresy. This classic silent film chronicles the endless tricks and misdirection employed by the church to gain Joan's confession so she can be burned alive as a heretic.At nearly 100 years old this is a considerable achievement, noted for its pretty much constant close ups on Joan her persecutors, so that instead of chronicling courtroom action you instead see the pain, anguish and anger in the faces of those involved. At the centre of this is of course Renée Jeanne Falconetti as Joan, giving, in close up, a stonking performance even by today's standards. The whole drama is moving and equally frustrating as God's priests on earth slowly but surely decide she must burn. This notorious climactic scene is itself impressively handled and broadened out from just close ups with the actual execution, poignantly and incredibly realistically staged. One you have to see if you love cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Recently re-released on video with a new score by Richard Einhorn (this score is a separate work of music, entitled ""Voices of Light""), this movie is one of the most powerful films ever created. Falconetti gives a stunning performance as Jeanne, displaying both human emotion and saintly fortitude. Jeanne cries throughout her intense trials, but maintains her convictions and answers her critics with wisdom and humility. Falconetti captures the strength of Jeanne, while sacrificing none of her femininity nor any of her pain and sorrow. Truly a masterful performance.",,Anonymous,History
The Finest Film Ever Made,"This has got to be the finest film that ever made. If you are watching this on DVD, make sure you get criterion collection. The whole film must be watched in one sitting, or it will break. Pay close attention to the camera-work and their angles. It shows what God sees and the emotions are captured perfectly in this film. I was dumbstruck after seeing the film as it is so powerful. It beats every single film I have ever saw. Current favourites like Lord of the Rings pale in comparison to this. The actress who played Joan is perfect, as her eyes tell the viewer so much and her fragile features in the face of the 'horned' judges makes you seem like you are there inside the trial. This film is also quite accurate, and that makes the film a whole lot more enjoyable. If you must see one film in your entire life, make it this one.",10.0,Anonymous,History
An inquisition of the soul.,"It is to be regretted that owing to defective equipment Carl Dreyer was unable to realise his film with sound as originally intended and that by the time the uncut version was finally released talking pictures were all the rage which meant that his masterpiece was consigned to the relative oblivion of art houses. Critics early recognised its qualities however and over ninety years on it remains an immensely powerful and mesmerising work which is difficult to define. Cocteau describes it as well as anyone by saying that ""it seems like an historical document from an era in which the cinema didn't exist.""Based as it is upon historical transcripts and telescoping the events of eighteen months into one day Dreyer has typically made no concessions to the viewer and gives us a series of startling images whilst the relentless close ups typify his belief that film should show the 'drama of the spirit'. The judges are without make up and shot in stark black and white from a low angle whilst Joan is filmed predominantly from high in softer greys. The avant-garde sets of Hermann Warm and Jean Hugo do not seem at all incongruous and the charcoal lamps that Rudolph Maté uses for lighting add to the film's mystical quality. The influence of Eisenstein, particularly the final sequence, is there for all to see.Dreyer first came across Renée Falconetti in a boulevard comedy and somehow recognised her potential as the Maid of Orléans. Film tests revealed what the director called 'a soul behind the facade' and her casting proved a masterstroke. By all accounts he really put her through it but drew from her one of the most unforgettable performances on film. Pauline Kael has called it the greatest performance but that is purely subjective. What is certain is that her innate spirituality and other-worldliness have proved the most difficult to equal and she remains the template by which other actresses in the role are judged. The fact that Mlle Falconetti was never again to be seen on screen adds to her legendary status.Carl Dreyer's unique and uncompromising vision resulted in few films throughout his career but his elevated reputation and the reverence in which he is held prove the value of scarcity.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Very ""Hot Stuff"" in the France of 1928","My theory on why we almost lost this one (most of the prints were destroyed in the '30s):The Great War all but destroyed what was left of a French Enlightenment and democratic tradition that was little more than 150 years old. The culture that had spawned Descartes, Focault, Rousseau and Napoleon was in decline well =before= the huns charged across Flanders in 1914, but it was in a moral, spiritual and financial power-dive and headed down the road into a civil war between the urban socialists and communists vs. the urban and rural landholding, wealthy, ultra-conservative fascists in 1928.The Holy Roman Church retained its power in the provinces, but as urbanization spread, France was splitting into a polarized culture of progressive, anti-clerical urbanites who watched films and listened to the radio and traditionalistic – and politically conservative -- peasants. The great landowners of the northeast had been all but ruined by the Great War, and it would be some time before they held the political power they'd had until 1914.French politics involved endless battles between labor unions and manufacturers in the cities. Fascism was on the rise, but it was a listless, reactive, passionless sort, as opposed to all the excitement in Italy and Germany at the time. The modern viewer may do well to understand this as he or she watches ""The Passion"" For this is a film of metaphors.The Paris intellectuals of the '20s saw Benedict 15th, and Pius 10th, 11th and 12th during the early part of the 20th century as the popes and anti-popes of Joan's day.Joan of Arc had ""led"" the pro-papist (""conservative"") French forces that installed pro-papist king Charles 7th to the throne during the Hundred Years War against the English in the early 15th century. She may have been canonized for her role in ""saving France for Holy Roman Church,"" but she is also seen by many in France as the savior of the culture in the face of a very serious foreign threat.Some saw French politics in the '20s and '30s as strikingly parallel to the politics of Joan's time. A prisoner of his very divided College of Cardinals (many from the Central Powers), Pius 10th stood on the sidelines as Germany and Austria-Hungary set about dismantling the rest of the Continent.The urban French audiences of 1928, and indeed, the audiences in much of Northern Europe understood the ""message"" here, depending upon their point of view: Kill the threatening energy of French democracy and give us another ""man on a horse"" (and good churchman), in this case a war hero named Philippe Petain... the very same Marshal Petain who would head the puppet Vichy government for the Nazis just a dozen years later.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Ahead of its time, and deeply moving.","With the story of Joan of Arc containing so much information, I believe the film would have benefited from being a talkie instead of a silent film. As a result, there are more inter-titles here than I've seen in any other silent film. This is a difficult story to tell without dialogue, since Joan's confession and testimony ultimately determined her fate.Jeanne D'Arc was not the Joan in helmet and armor, but simple and human. She was a young woman of nineteen who was deeply religious and believed she was sent by God to save France. Claiming to have seen visions and being told by God to wear men's clothing until she has fulfilled her task, she was charged with heresy and condemned to death.In a time when people had limited knowledge and understanding of the world, the universe and the unknown, women - especially - were easily judged and accused of witchcraft. Thousands were burnt at the stake by the Church ""in the name of God"". To this day, the Church never apologized for all those innocent deaths, but that's a debate for another platform.Since we know Joan's fate, there is no surprises how the film will end, but the journey to the finale is interesting, and I thought Maria Falconetti did a great job as Joan. She managed to convey so much emotion with her eyes. It's a pity she never pursued film acting, especially since she won a Best Performance award.Joan was attacked by theologians and experienced lawyers, and was being mocked while being trialed. The film's last moments are far more intense than I could have imagined for a film of 1928, and it must have been very disturbing at the time of release. 'The Passion of Joan of Arc' is a depressing film, but nevertheless very well made, and a good film.The photography and cinematography felt ahead of its time.

one of the finest works by a female  lead in the history of Cinema,"Along side Marion Cotillard of la Vie en Rose, and Meryl Streep of Sophie's Choice, Rosaura Revueltas of Salt of the Earth and Jessica Lange of Rob Roy, Maria Falconetti's Joan of Arc is a masterwork of the cinematic arts.Although it deserves to be rated as one of the best films of all time, let this beautiful work stay in obscurity to be seen only by those who seek it out. The price of admission is not enough to pay for the privilege to experience this film.Additionally this remains an important movie. Joan's crime of consorting with God without the consent and supervision of His owners is the most dangerous crime of all. Politics, not spirituality, is the evil here. In this instance it was the Catholic Church used as the justification, but it happens constantly over and over any time those in power feel a challenge to their supremacy.

Passion is the correct word.,"The Passion of Joan of Arc strikes me right away as a film with so much to say that it is hard to contain on film alone.  Let me explain.  The pure, raw emotions expressed by Maria Falconetti as Joan burst off the screen. Her performance was the highlight of the film for me.  I never would have expected to see so many different shades of terror, loss, sadness, etc. expressed so expertly.  She just drew me in. The film style of Carl Dreyer also makes this picture stand out among others of the time and even now.  Notice how we never see a wide establishing shot.  Instead, Dreyer aggressively chose to shoot the whole thing with medium shots to extreme close-ups.  This technique, combined with a fair amount of camera subjectivity creates for the viewer a sense of intimacy with Joan.  At least it did for me.  I couldn't help but sympathize with her if not theologically, then purely visually. It is a terrifying thing to face death, but it is also an interesting twist for this story that Joan knows no matter what anyone says, that she is on the right side.  To be able to convey such inner turmoil in a character is a fantastic achievement.  Furthermore, the director shot her so well, that her performance needed to be as excellent as it was.  The viewer was going to get close to Joan and feel her pain.  That was a directorial decision, it was up to Joan to draw us closer. Also of note is the blatant reference to the `Odessa Steps' scene in Eisenstein's Potemkin (1925).  Dreyer's use of montage is appropriate and skillfully done.  However, I was a bit disappointed to see a repetition of what such a popular director had just done. Overall, this film seems to me to be a great example of film as art. Though visually stunning, the film's only downfall is that it may have been too long.  I feel the story could have been portrayed just as well in say, 30 minutes.  Something doesn't have to take an hour and a half to move us.",,Anonymous,History

The Eyes Have It (and the music helps too...),"I go to the movies to feel more human. I want to see on screen what I feel inside my heart, and when a film expresses emotion so authentically--so real--that I am moved to tears, then that is the highest praise I can give.Falconetti's portrayal of Joan is what everyone else has said: powerful, sensitive, and moving. Her eyes burn up the screen. In them, you see Joan's struggle for truth and justice, and her love of God. In a less capable actress, Joan would come across as vapid, insane, or fanatical, but Falconetti takes you to the precipice of your emotions and it is a mystical experience to watch.Dreyer's direction is visionary. Unlike most silent films, it is wonderfully modern in its use of close ups of Falconetti. Beyond these remarkable closeups, Dreyer has a great visual sense, most notably in two pivotal scenes: the torture chamber, which gets your heart pumping, and the climax/finale, where you feel for Joan and then it rouses you (like the crowd) to anger. The film's sets are spare and white, not unlike a sanitarium, which gives you a sense of the trapped sensation that Joan must have felt in her last days on earth.Buoying this work of art is Richard Einhorn's score, ""Voices of Light,"" which although not the original musical accompaniment to the film, it was inspired by the film. The score is worthy in its own right and it adds considerably to the film's impact.The backstory how this lost film was ""found"" in a mental institution is worthy of further investigation.

The use of close up shots, while the actors don't have any makeup on, makes this really timeless even when it's a film from the silent era. The production itself is huge and the direction that innovatively uses everything with the huge production, Falconetti still stands out as the MVP. The emotions that are displayed by her alone makes it worth watching to anyone. I'd sooner forget about the Dryer's methods to get that performance out of her though.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Something Only Silent Era Could Execute, Something Only Silence Can Still Achieve...","When tormented by lots of noisy productions of modern cinema, blockbusters filled with effects and action so successful at the box office, it is easy to remain both blind and mute to true art that silently addresses human sensibility. However, though so often neglected, forgotten for years, considered 'lost', it appears to rise again after a few generations in order to overwhelm a totally different audience...This film, having experienced a strange fate of storms and fires, had to wait for decades in the dust of forgotten past in order to be acclaimed one of the true classics of cinema, one of its most genuine achievements. And many people will perhaps agree with me that its story does not constitute the only reason for its success.The most significant aspect that makes LA PASSION DE JEANNE D'ARC so authentic nowadays are its humane depiction and realistic interpretation. It is not a hagiography of a saint who lived more than 500 years ago but a powerful insight into one of the most infamous trials in history when the daughter of God was found to be a daughter of Satan by...the 'holy' learned ecclesiastics. This trial, based on true notes, is presented in a unique, vivid manner where the viewer is stuck by merits galore characterized by profoundity of development, symbolism of visuals and simplicity of portrayals. Here, a necessary analysis must be made concerning the most significant merit of the movie, Marie Falconetti in the lead.Considering Marie Falconetti, I would like to refer to the words entailed in the New York Times article which discussed the 'poignant' French film that premiered at the dusk of silent era. ""as one witnesses her (Marie's) eyes filling with tears or perceives a faint grateful smile crossing her appealing countenance, one feels that it would be difficult indeed to elicit from any other actress such an eloquent interpretation as she gives in this production."" Yes, Marie Falconetti gives a timeless, the most unique performance that appears to be as mesmerizing as it must have been in 1928. She executes the chain of various emotions from disappointment, shock, fear, sorrow, blissful hope, regret, to courageous dignifying faith. Her portrayal of a misguided lamb being found guilty, accused of heresy, tortured and executed by knowledgeable wolves is even more intensified by one more important aspect: close-ups.Indeed, the film can boast an unusual number of close-ups --- ones, as Gary Morris nicely put it (2000), ""among the most harrowing, claustrophobic ever."" This strategy used so widely by director Dreyer makes the movie one ahead of its time, something innovative that introduced cinema to its more mature level of development. It also allows us to witness the whole drama on silver screen more intensely, feel sympathy for the main character while her bitter experience of the unjust accusations and satanic furies of the 'decent.' Throughout the movie, her face appears to represent the purity, upright heart, courage and holiness as contrasted to the wretched faces of wrath, corruption, hypocrisy and misery.Besides, you can find lots of memorable moments thanks to Dreyer's masterful direction and Rudolph Mate's brilliant cinematography. Who can possibly skip such memorable scenes like the faces of the judges (the cast with no make-ups - so rare for its period), detailed symbolism of single images like torture chamber or mockery of Joan's Christ-like figure, the emphasis on various images of the Cross as sort of metaphorical manifestation of the main character's mind and heart.I particularly liked the atmosphere close to the end when the viewer is truly led into the dramatic twilight of justice and, more to say, hope for justice. What seems to remain, what seems to be everlasting is... Love, the Love given by God, the Love that transforms and turns a dark night into a bright day: Joan takes the last Sacrament while the stake awaits her, the stake symbolizing earthly fire of destruction. These are the most powerful moments of the film. To make this experience even more unforgettable , I recommend you to see the film with Richard Einhorn's magnificent ""Voices of Light"" in the background. He wrote this music having seen the film and having been inspired by it.Summing it up, I will again refer to the words of Gary Morris who reviewed the film at its DVD release (2000): LA PASSION DE JEANNE D'ARC ""reverses the cliché that 'life imitates art."" Similarly to the Maid of Orleans, it was rejected, destroyed by fire, forgotten; yet, when everything seems to be over, the genuine power of honest art strangely triumphs, does triumph like Joan who was canonized 5 centuries after her infamous execution. Perhaps, it has a message for us, she has a message for us, a touching but universal message for humanity and about humanity: its rises and falls, its deaths and triumphs heard in the astonishing sound of silence.",10.0,Anonymous,History

""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" is one of the most visually arresting feature films ever made. As I understand it, the film follows the transcripts of the trial of Joan of Arc. It is fascinating to watch the angst and anguish of this young woman. You really feel the strength of spirit that Joan had. As this young woman faces down the church and political leaders of her country without wavering from her convictions one cannot help but be moved and struck by the power of her devotion. The cinematography alone makes this film worthwhile.",10.0,Anonymous,History
...and hope and faith...,"This silent masterpiece, based off historical records, reveals the trial and execution of Joan of Arc. It was wonderfully acted, with Maria Falconetti giving a particularly moving performance as the lead. And director Carl Theodor Dreyer really captures the detailed expressions and emotions of all the actors through a constant use of close-ups, which also added to the sense of distress and torment, and hope and faith, this picture intended to convey. The film is also quite stylish, with sharp editing, reverse camera angles, quick montages, and multiple instances of symbolism. Set design, or at least what was shown of it, was sparse but believably so, and gave several nods to German expressionism. The Criterion DVD does justice to this once lost work of art, giving us the option to watch it completely silent or with the Voices of Light soundtrack, an operatic orchestration inspired by the film, which I found to be very fitting. Also included on the disc is a comprehensive commentary track, a feature on the history and many versions of the film, and several other worthwhile extras. All in all, this is the best silent film I've seen and I'm glad I went ahead and purchased it.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The Overwhelming Power of the Human Face,"You will not appreciate the experience of silent film until you know the face of Renee Maria Falconetti. In a medium without words, where the filmmakers conceived that the camera seized the heart of characters through their faces, to see Falconetti in Dreyer's landmark is to look into electric, almost extrasensory eyes that will never relinquish you. She also embodies Joan with an unrelenting monastic guilelessness, moving as if in a dream, her body language so slow and meditative. She answers questions in taut earnest.Dreyer had been given a large budget and a screenplay by his French producers, but he sacked the screenplay and turned in lieu to the archives of Joan's trial. They told the account that has become folklore: of how a rustic provincial girl, dressed as a boy, led the French troops in their triumph over the British occupation forces. How she was captured by French loyal to the British and brought before a church court, where her conviction that she had been emboldened by celestial apparitions led to accusations of blasphemy. There were many cross-examinations, supplemented by torment, before Joan was burned at the stake. Dreyer coalesces them into one trial, in which the judges, their faces wrenched with their alarm at her dauntlessness, hover over her with roars and charges. Men here who think they represent God are the cruelest to her. She remains undeterred. Believing her would compromise their beliefs. So she is punished for the same thing that drives them to punish her: Faith.There is not one single establishing shot in all of Dreyer's passion play, which is filmed with eccentric, idealistic mystery by Rudolph Mate completely in closeups and medium shots, creating apprehensive proximity between Joan and her oppressors. Nor are there freely interpreted perceptible connections between shots. What does this signify to us? There is a lexicon of shooting and editing that we subliminally presume at the movies. We figure that if two people are talking, the cuts will make it appear that they are facing one another. We expect that if a judge is challenging a defendant, the camera position and editing will make it evident where they stand regarding each other. If we see three people in a room, we presume to be able to say how they are situated and which is nearest to the camera. Almost all such visual expectations are absent from this film, replaced by an all-encompassing disjointed effect.Alternatively, the placement of cuts shapes the film into a sequence of surprising panchromatic imagery. The prison guards and the ecclesiastics on the court are seen in high contrast, frequently from a low angle, and although there are frequently knifelike structural shapes behind them, we are not certain precisely what the distance is. There is a shot of three priests, likely positioned from front to back, but shot in such a way that their heads appear piled on top of each other. All of the faces of the inquisitors are shot in bright light, without makeup, so that the clefts and blemishes of their skin appear to evince an ailing internal life.Falconetti, in comparison, is shot in more delicate grays, instead of blacks and whites. Also without makeup, she appears austere and absorbed by internal certainty. Solitude proves her only on-screen companion in the whole film. Note an exchange where a judge asks her whether St. Michael indeed spoke to her. Her serene face looks to propose that whatever happened between Michael and herself was so far outside the compass of the question that no answer is possible.Why did Dreyer splinter his space, obscure the visual impression and shoot in closeup? He might've wanted to eschew the refined snares of a historical drama. There is no landscape here, save walls and arches. Nothing was put in to look pleasing. You do not leave talking about costumes, granted they are all real. The preeminence of the faces asserts that these very people did what they did. Dreyer dismantles the church court of its ceremony and respectability and reveals its members as obese charlatans in the pay of the British. Their fixed eyes and mercenary mouths violate Joan's asceticism.To us contemporary audiences, accustomed to films where emotion is reflected by dialogue and action more than by faces, a film like this 1928 sequence of expressions is a disconcerting undertaking, so penetrating we worry we will unearth more occult than we wish, although watching with the Visions of Light soundtrack makes a hugely profound difference. It is deeply moving music, and also allows a less demanding experience from a modern audience. It is a testament to the film's power that it also features a performance by Antonin Artaud, who wrote of a need for a ""Theatre of Cruelty,"" by which he meant a fierce, physical grit to eradicate false reality. He believed that text had been a bully over subject and implication, and wanted in its place a theatre comprised of a unique language halfway between concept and action. Our compassion is provoked so vigorously for Joan that Dreyer's visual methods don't even play like aesthetic decisions, but like the remnants of Joan's experience. Depleted, emaciated, frozen, in perpetual despair, merely 19 when she died, she lives in a chimera where the faces of her tyrants surge like savage nightmares.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Haunting Portrayal,"A fairly well known religious story, French director Carl Theodor Dreyer made The Passion of Joan of Arc in 1928. Because it is silent and in black and white, facial expressions via frequent close ups must convey the sincerity of the subject. Whether she was insane and delusional or was actually hearing the voice of God is up to the viewer to decide. I have to separate my personal views as a retired Catholic from my review.Joan is played magnificently by Renee Jeanne Falconetti, who so convincingly portrays the future saints' emotional character so well. Her performance has been hailed by many as one of the best ever captured on film.The transcript of her trial is used as the basis, with judges on a panel interrogating Joan and doubting her message from above, to drive the English from France. Even under torture, she never relents, and it is not a spoiler to mention the burning at the stake, which is not a secret. The Passion of Joan of Arc is a work of art, regardless of ones beliefs about the supernatural. Ms. Falconetti's last role is a memorable one, which should be studied by everyone in the acting profession for a lesson in perfection.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Overwhelming,"Strikingly beautiful, the movie delivers even if you see without any sound. Surprisingly simple (only a few scenes, most of the movie is made of close-ups and shot indoors) it has nevertheless the characteristic that elevates a director to the height of myth. And here the screaming yet peaceful expression of Maria Falconetti is pivotal - she conveys all the emotions that the viewer feels, and therefore nearly expenses the need of other characters in the picture. Magnificently shot, amazingly acted, this is a masterpiece in every sense of the word, that has the power to make you really develop feelings towards it. Unmissable.",10.0,Anonymous,History

"Joan, we hardly know ya...","TPOJOA. What can I say. I saw this movie back in the summer of 1990 and I hate to sound like one of those people that always say a movie is boring unless there are lots of special effects, or predictable action every ten minutes, or if it was made before 1990.  But I'm not going to say it's boring - it's not -, to me it's something else: It's DEPRESSING!I remember reading all the positive write ups about this film before I saw it. I must've looked for it for probably 5 years before I finally found it and rented it from an out of state video distributor.  I can't believe someone could make a depressing silent film, but they did! When it was over I couldn't wait to mail it back to the video distributor. I can't imagine any part of a sunny day that I would want to give up to see this movie. Or any part of a rainy day for that matter.And I'm not saying the people who like this movie are depressed individuals, on the contrary I admire them for taking the initiative to see and appreciate a ""difficult"" film like this.Don't get me wrong, it's a extremely well made film and some of my favorite films can be considered to be ""sad films"", but sad can be surrounded by beauty (Read: ""It's a sad and beautiful world""), but depressing is beyond sad, it's hopelessness, there isn't any beauty around that.See the odd camera angle as the English soldier reaches back for his weapons to be later used to beat the heck out of the peasants who support Joan. See the English soldiers beat the heck out of the charging peasants. See the birds fly from the trees as Joan is about to burn. Hear the hectic staccato organ music as she burns.It's also amazing but after seeing this film I have less respect for Joan than before. Is she truly a Saint? I don't know this film doesn't help. And to make matters worse, after I viewed this film I went to bed and had the strangest nightmare I've ever had.There is one interesting line in the film. As one of the peasants in the film says as they're about to torch Joan: ""If they're not crucifying 'em, they're burning 'em!""If you want to see something a little more uplifting by Carl Dreyer I recommend you check out ""Ordet"" (1955) instead. It's a much better movie and it's not depressing, just puzzling. I finally saw it about 3 months ago and I didn't have any bad dreams after viewing it!If you want to see another depressing film like this one then you may want to check out ""The Devils"" (1971). It has sound, is in color and leaves one with the same empty wasted feeling at the end!",4.0,Anonymous,History
The Lotus position,"I subscribe to the notion that says there are really very few great films in the small history of the medium so far, truly great ones. It has to be so, and you have to make sure. I believe that you have to be versatile and familiar with a lot of films, but let really few touch you, if the touch is to matter at all.My practice is that I normally resist emotional content and think less of films that solely try to exploit the fact we are, by nature, emotional beings, this being our weakness, and that is because most filmmakers, even a lot of otherwise great ones, are really tactless with these things to allow them into my life in that capacity. They are quick to wound and anxious to heal you back.This I welcomed with no resistance. This is the most sorrowful cadence, purely concentrated interior space until the last minute. And it is, perhaps, the most spiritual film I have seen, quite apart from the obvious fact that it deals with god and transcendent faith.Knowing this was altogether lost to us until very recently, and the chances it would be at all rediscovered really nonexistent, makes me feel like Nietzche confronted with the horse in Turin. So much beauty just a short step from being so casually erased from ever getting to know about it. But we did, and it wasn't. And how it was discovered is equally stunning, I mean can you imagine the chain of events? An original copy somehow ended up in a Danish mental asylum, and was it screened at all there? Did it mend some broken soul? Did the preacher let it do his preaching? And the cabinet opened 50 years down the line, the film is there. What are the chances?And Maria Falconetti, the most mysterious figure in all of cinema with only this major role to her credit. Did she go insane from too much pain, as portrayed here? Did she open a brothel in Argentina, as rumored? Suicide? Or, so much more ingloriously, died from a crash-diet?Further back in time, a teenage peasant girl in armor leading armies into battle and lifting sieges, guided by visions - god or madness, it doesn't matter, the words describe one thing. Her complete testimony before a mock trial survived and from the hands of her captors. Again, what are the chances?So folks, let the multi-faceted story of this film being made sooth and guide you home. Because it is a stranger world than anyone captured on film.Because all we have between us is testimonies of life, no doubt doctored, in our case by notaries at Rouen, the doctored version presented as truth, the truth always mediated by who's telling the story; we have blurred roles and so hard to surmise the real being, the woman as maiden, mad saint, icon, soldier, visionary actress, whore, real or imagined; we have staged fiction to frame our experience, mock trial, private dealings, confession, Sacrament, public execution, our film about these things, lost and foung again. And so, having caught a glimpse of this fabric that is chaotic, arbitrary life behind the images and stories we devise as scaffold to support a shape, we may concede at last that it's a world spinning madly out of orbit, beyond anyone's control except who writes the stories. Did god ever speak to her?Except for one thing, that we have this film and performance about a woman having visions as our vision about her. This is our center, a woman appearing before a camera some time in 1927.This is our spiritual center, and it is fitting that this maelstrom of a performance will be forever associated with and help explain a legend. This is where the divine madness of god speaks. In the utter, unbreakable, single-pointed concentration this woman and the man filming her embodied and sustained, this is the essence of spirituality.I'm not just babbling here. I know of only one image where god appears, not the traditional god but the state of mind that might as well be described in those terms. It is the picture of Buddhist monk Thich Quang Duc's self-immolation at Saigon. A human being sitting calmly in the lotus position as flames surge out of him.Oh, Falconetti is ravaged by emotion throughout and far from Guang Duc's meditative dispassion, a very Christian image of torment, a very Lutheran film, grim, recoiling under the gaze of an austere god, but it is very much the performance of a woman transforming herself into pure soul. In the end, she burns serenely. She burns and the world at her feet is torn asunder.",,Anonymous,History
"Not my favorite silent film, but in my opinion, the greatest","It takes a real man to admit that his favorite item in a genre, is not the greatest. Such is with me and The Passion of Joan of Arc. My favorite silent film is, and always will be, Murnau's Nosferatu. It is amongst my very, very favorite films. And while Nosferatu IS a masterpiece, it is not as great as Dreyer's The Passion of Joan of Arc, which is easily the greatest silent film of all time. This is a truly magnificent film, and belongs amongst the ten greatest films of all time. Rich and detailed, with attention paid to historical authenticity. It is an artistic film, but not quite avant garde...the message and style of the film are crystal clear, and presented as such on Criterion's DVD.

One of the earliest masterpieces,"The Passion of Joan of Arc was a groundbreaking movie in its own time. Humongous set build just for the film, visionary camera techniques yet unseen, controversial subject matter, powerful role performances. Everything needed for a true classic.The film has withstood the test of time remarkably well. True, the story itself is a bit bare boned compared to modern films, but the fact that it's based on true events, real historical trial manuscripts, gives it gravitas.And it's simply shot so well. Director Carl Theodor Dreyer relies on extreme close-ups and harsh lighting to accentuate either the suffering or the grotesqueness of his characters, and it works wonders. Denying his actors makeup also helps, highlighting every pore and wrinkle on their faces.Renée Jeanne Falconetti's performance as Joan of Arc has been hailed as one the all-time best in cinema history. Not without merit, I have to admit. The fragility of Joan and her situation in the hands of English comes through crystal clear. Yet, her performance is perhaps too fragile. If you study Joan of Arc at all, and especially if you read the actual trial manuscripts, you're going to meet a woman perfectly willing to give as good as she gets. A woman of conviction, who laid doubt into the hearts of even her harshest critics with her piety and belief. That aspect of her character is somewhat missing in Falconetti's performance.Still, it's a great film. A must see for all those that are studying cinema and for those that want to see the best films ever made.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"The Nerve, The Vision","The  Masters of Cinema series released their long-awaited restoration of Dreyer's ""La passion de Jeanne d'Arc"" (1928) on Blu-ray last November. It includes the ""Oslo print"" in two different projection speeds, both 20fps and 24fps, as well as the ""Lo Duca"" bastardization. Highly recommended not only for the beautiful 1080p presentation but also for the booklet that comes with it.It's been some 10 years since I last saw this, and intriguingly divergent films and memories have superseded Dreyer's film in the memory. I couldn't remember the stylized movement of the camera and the imaginative camera angles, and how they have likely inspired Eisenstein's ""Ivan Groznyi"" (1944) and Welles' ""Othello"" (1952). Dreyer's unflinching nerve, his clear vision, and the unity of that vision. Someone somewhere has called this the ultimate close-up, and it most certainly is. Nick Wrigley, formerly of the Masters of Cinema team, describes the release on Twitter as ""a magic death-defying fever dream. I can't imagine a luckier Blu-ray on earth. 20fps pure joy"". I really like the phrasing in ""death-defying fever dream""; this is exactly that, a fervent, dreamlike, atmospheric, never-consumed – much like his later masterpiece and for me his apotheosis, ""Vampyr"" (1932), his subsequent film.And if you've never tried it, it's one of the most intimate experiences one can have, watching a silent film completely silent, without any music. I did this with the silent comedies of Ozu, released by the BFI on DVD, mainly because I didn't like the new scores they recorded for them. The experience is otherworldly.The ""Lo Duca"" version now seems like a bad joke in its emotional manipulativeness. If you want to find out how to mistreat the beautiful passages of Bach and Albinoni, look no further and give the ""Lo Duca"" a spin.I prefer the 20fps version, and I really have no interest in going back to 24fps unless for comparative purposes. It flows more naturally (to my eyes) and viewed silent has more flair to it (to my tastes).I'm looking forward to many high definition fever dreams to come.",9.0,Anonymous,History
The Shape of Cinema to Come,"An absolute landmark in cinema. I wasn't expecting this to be so intense. The directing and cinematography are peak and the performances, mainly Renée Falconetti, scorch the retina of both agony and crucifixion. The additional impeccable score acts as a guiding force that tethers the film together. It's all too perfect right here. Love the religious symbolism and god do I love the composition. Joan is framed with the camera looking down, but as she remains steadfast, the camera hoisters down a bit and views her upward, emphasizing her moral superiority and power over the court.What fascinates me the most is the how the film challenges both a Catholic and Atheist viewpoint. A catholic may view the corruption of the court as elites who have abused their free will granted by God. Whereas an atheist may believe that the court's antithetical use of God suggests there is no true God. Carl Theodor Dreyer also uses imagery to enhance the conflict. The obvious cross symbol is ever so present but Dreyer twists its inherent nature, embodying cruelty rather than redemption. Consider the shadow of the religious cross reflected through a window. As Joan makes a slight smile at the shadow, it instantly vanishes, blocked by the two-faces judge's white garment. Religion has the divine opportunity to heal and console, but when challenged with a perplexed evil, it can do nothing but scurry in fear.Man, it's the movies like these that inspire me to create and pursue all the passions. They're also clear examples of the often neglected silent age of film. Most people won't watch this simply because it was made in a time without spoken language. But if a film can get across as many points and ideas as this one without the need for vocals, then it's begging to be seen.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Several times I had to remind myself that this was NOT a pseudo-documentary in that vein. Then it occurred to me that, having been made in 1928, it was before the advent of television,so this bonus effect had not been planned. Of course seeing it on video on an actual television must have added to the effect.The spare, largely blank gray background and closeups of Joan concentrated ones attention on her and heightened her personal pain, dread and tragedy.For me this was a new treatmernt of with new insights into the Joan of arc story.",8.0,Anonymous,History
One of the All-Time Greatest Movies,"A chronicle of the trial of Jeanne d'Arc (Maria Falconetti) on charges of heresy, and the efforts of her ecclesiastical jurists to force Jeanne to recant her claims of holy visions.Dreyer really loves his close-ups in this picture, stressing the rough humanity of the faces -- they are not pretty, but full of emotion and contour. I can see why it was a commercial flop, as it is not terribly entertaining... but the pure genius of the film can be appreciated from a critical point of view.Mordaunt Hall said ""as a film work of art this takes precedence over anything that has so far been produced. It makes worthy pictures of the past look like tinsel shams. It fills one with such intense admiration that other pictures appear but trivial in comparison."" That might be a bit of a stretch, but I can hardly disagree too strongly. My only real complaint is that Joan of Arc was 19 at the time of trial... and Falconetti was 35 or 36. But I cannot fault her acting.The Criterion Collection comes with Richard Einhorn's ""Voices of Light"" as an optional score to the film. I strongly recommend this. While the film is powerful even silent, Einhorn nailed the feeling and more... I cannot imagine a better musical attachment to such a film.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"The Passion of Joan of Arc: Historically Significant but Lacks Appeal, 3/10","The Passion of Joan of Arc, a silent film from 1928, earns a 3/10 from me primarily due to its lack of sound, which significantly impacts its appeal to modern audiences. While it stands as a monumental piece in cinema history, the absence of dialogue and sound makes it a challenging watch for those accustomed to the audio-visual experience of contemporary films.The film is renowned for its powerful visual storytelling and the intense, emotive performance of Renée Jeanne Falconetti as Joan of Arc. However, the silent format, a standard of its era, can be disengaging for viewers who rely on sound and dialogue to fully immerse themselves in a film. This lack of audio dimension limits the film's ability to convey the depth and nuances of its narrative effectively to a modern audience.Furthermore, the pacing and style of silent films like The Passion of Joan of Arc are vastly different from today's cinema. The slower narrative progression and reliance on visual cues to tell the story can feel alien and less engaging to those more familiar with fast-paced, dialogue-driven movies.In summary, while The Passion of Joan of Arc is a significant work in film history and a testament to early cinematic achievements, its silent nature and the resulting limitations in storytelling make it less accessible and enjoyable for contemporary viewers, reflected in the lower rating.",3.0,Anonymous,History
The Last Epic Silent Film,"I was told in class that this film was to be made with synchronous sound, but the technology was slow to reach France in time, so it was released as a silent film instead.  Which doesn't matter, because it is already one of the most powerfully emotional films ever made, sound or no sound.  I was really blown away, not just with the acting (which is amazing) but with the trick camera work.  The surreal low angles that are used make the necessary characters imposing and threatening, and the scene that has the camera swinging away from the building is jaw dropping!The climax of the film is searing!(pardon the bad pun)  The trial and Joan's heartfelt testimony build suspense that will have you on the edge of your seat, and her punishment is a testament to pre-production code censorship. Very graphic, I was surprised.  This truly is one of the best silent films ever made.  By far the most powerful. Don't be scared of the age of the film - some stories stand the test of time better than others, and this one certainly is a benchmark.  Enjoy it.",,Anonymous,History
incredible camera work... a true original!,"The Passion of Joan of Arc is one of the most perfect movies ever made, if not the most perfect. Falconetti gives the most ecstatic, tormented performance of Joan that is undoubtedly the best acting ever caught on camera. The jarring style of editing, cuts and camera work defies all the known rules of shooting at the time, and you can see the influence this movie has had on filmmakers like Hitchcock and Fellini. This is also one of the only surviving filmed performances of Antonin Artaud, the 'enfant terrible' of French stage and cinema, and a fascinating poet and author as well. It is worth seeing for so many reasons! I highly recommend it, a perfect ten of a movie",10.0,Anonymous,History
The Divine in cinematic form,"A timeless treatise on the agony of the soul that bristles against the confines of its structure, so much of The Passion of Joan of Arc's power comes from its use of close-ups, carefully constructed yet completely raw in its delivery. The film makes for an intimately unsettling watch, as director Carl Dreyer's shooting style traps the viewer as much as the players, his camera acting like a microscope, peering into the souls of the legions of men circling Joan like a pack of hyenas, trying to break down her soul and force a confession. Ultimately it's Maria Falconetti who steals the show, her haunted face channelling both the agony and the ecstasy of martyrdom, youthful and weathered; her expressions are tortured but joyous, it's a legendary performance. Richard Einhorn's Voices of Light just further adds to this film's haunting beauty, creating a deeply moving experience, one that captures spiritual rapture and institutional hypocrisy in stark, almost vivid, life. One of the most transcendent pieces I've seen from the silent era, The Passion of Joan of Arc is the divine captured on film, a thing of irreproachable honesty and ethereal suffering.",9.0,Anonymous,History

This is probably due to the Panchromatic Film. The panchromatic emulsion is a type of black-and-white photographic emulsion that is sensitive to all wavelengths of visible light.Be sure to take advantage of the extra features such as ""commentaries"" as it adds to the understanding of what is trying to be portrayed (this can be a revelation.)

Timeless mysticism founded in stark realism,"The saint Maid of Orléans' legend has been filmed many times, but no version can hold a candle to Dreyer's groundbreaking silent take on the subject matter. What the ingenious Dane himself dubbed ""psychological realism"" and ""realized mysticism"" is a masterfully shot close-up feast generating an overwhelming flood of imagery, a lead that Dreyer called the ""martyr's reincarnation herself"" (the incomparable Renee Falconetti) and powerful re-enactment of original dialog transcribed at the trial in 1431. But it's also a forthright picture sans make-up, sound, not even a backstory is there, but all of it is lacking for a reason. ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" is completely focused film-making, minimalism in its purest form, centering entirely on a core theme and thus radically eliminating all other elements that hinder the primary endeavor. Even the sets only seem to exist merely on the fringe of the spiritual drama and tragedy, which unfolds through the eyes of the actors via glimmers, flickers and stares. Confronted with piercing questions again and again circling like vultures above the torn state of mind of the famous maid, Joan's soul is revealed to us. Enlightened or a lunatic is not for the film-maker to decide. However, simplicity elevated to a film-making method makes our own observations a devastating and spellbinding journey at the same time, a journey into another world from where there is no escape. What we witness is indeed timeless mysticism founded in stark realism, and that's why it shakes us to the bone.Dreyer preferred the picture to be shown in dead silence, which makes ""Joan of Arc"" work as a highly contemplative, almost tangible spiritual experience of the first rank. Nevertheless several composers have tried to provide a score to this masterpiece, giving the scenes a completely new spin - all very diverse attempts, ranging from piano accompaniment to very modern interpretations. The definitive one of these is Richard Einhorn's orchestral choir supported ""Voices of Light"" soundtrack (1995), a masterpiece in itself, but together with Dreyer's intimate rendering of Joan of Arc's devotion to her belief an entirely new sublime work of art emerges. Completely silent or with the Einhorn score: there's no way around Falconetti's soulful portrayal in one of the greatest films of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A Haunting Masterpiece,"When Carl Theodor Dreyer made this film in 1928, he wasn't yet the fixture of European cinema that he would be in later years. He had made several films in Denmark, now rarely seen. But this film was a revelation, and single-handedly put him on the map – four more great films followed (at long intervals): Vampyr, Day of Wrath, Ordet, and Gertrud, establishing Dreyer as one of Europe's predominant filmmakers.The Passion of Joan of Arc, based on actual court records from the time, tells the story of Joan of Arc's trial and execution. It says little, and shows nothing, of her earlier exploits, and in that way, it works very much as a passion story (as its title implies). Stylistically, it's a striking film, showing images that will burn themselves on your memory. It makes heavy use of close-ups, highlighting the subtle facial expressions of the characters, who didn't wear makeup for the film. Many of the camera angles are unlike anything I've yet seen in silent films.Maria Falconetti gives a mesmerizing performance as Joan. The raw emotion she conveys is remarkable, and it amazes me still how much she was able to say with her eyes. It's a shame that this is the only movie she made that can be easily found today (she made two minor films about a decade earlier.Another haunting characteristic of the film is the fact that it has no musical accompaniment.

A Mind-Blowing Silent Film Masterpiece (Almost),"Pros:
1. There is not a weak performance in sight, with Maria Falconetti (Jeanne d'Arc), Eugene Silvain (Évêque Pierre Cauchon), and Antonin Artaud (Jean Massieu) standing out as exceptional.
2. The score wonderfully emulates and induces every emotion from: hope, despondency, sadness, fear, grief, and more.
3. The set and costume design are great and build up the 15th century world greatly.
4. The cinematography is fantastic. The framing is incredible, and the zoom-ins and close-ups help to add so much weight to every scene.
5. The long and intense pauses are incredibly powerful in hitting home the emotions to the viewer.
6. The dialogue, although it's in written form to be congruent with the silent film model, is captivating, and almost ethereal in its structure and delivery.
7. The pacing is perfect, despite the limited setting and constricting plot. The movie never once feels tired or outstays its welcome.
8. The death of Jeanne d'Arc is simultaneously enthralling, beautifully shot, and exceedingly sad.
9. The film serves as a fitting tribute to Jeanne d'Arc, by detailing her indomitable faith, the virulent church suppression, as well as her staunch French nationalism.Cons:
1. Jeanne d'Arc was famously a teenager, and it's blatantly obvious that Maria Falconetti is much older than that (she was 35).
2. The ending riot scene feels rather unnecessary.",9.0,Anonymous,History

"Just the score would be enough for a fantastic experience, but the story and the way it's portrayed is amazing too","I haven't heard such a good score in a movie since watching Sideways (2004). I had goosebumps throughout the whole duration of the movie and just the idea of seeing this in the 1920s with the live orchestra makes me envy those who had their chance in the past. Just the music was enough to get me invested in the film but combining that with a great and passionate plot just made the watching experience unforgettable.Joan of Arc is a hero to many, an inspiration for many more, and a known historical figure for most. Looking back at when I was still at school, we only knew her as a heroine and savior of France, who was burned at the stake for her heresy, but we never discussed why and how that happened, we were only focused on the results of the Hundred Years' War. Looking back at it right now, that might not have been the best approach, since the story of Joan of Arc is an inspirational tale with a sad and bitter ending that offers a lot of insight about the less talked about side of the war. For example, an analogous version of Joan of Arc in Lithuania is Emilija Pliateryte - she was a patriotic noblewoman, who fought in the November Uprising of 1830-1831 against the Russian empire. She wasn't killed in battle, she has succumbed to an illness, but her feats and accomplishments are still talked about to this very day, just like with Joan of Arc.Since I started to talk about one woman, that's important to Lithuanian history, I'd like to talk about another one, a less know one - Monika Aluzaite. A Lithuanian historian Marius Emuzis recently put her story into a book and to me, it's really inspiring. Monika joined the partisans as a high school senior and even though she was with the partisans who were engaging in guerrilla warfare against the Soviet army after WW2, her battle was different - she was creating and distributing Lithuanian literature. After getting caught in a bunker by the enemy forces, she tried to kill herself to prevent any information from falling into the wrong hands. Her attempt wasn't successful and she ended up being tortured and blackmailed by the KGB. There's one picture in the book that really stuck out - a photo from her criminal proceeding, where she's standing with her hair cut off, eyes barely open and barely conscious after the second attempt of trying to commit suicide. The connection with Joan of Arc that I'm seeing is the passion and the will to do anything you can for the country you love, whether in the name of God or in the name of your people.Going back to the movie, what surprised me is that I didn't find any of the visuals to be boring. Seeing the emotions in everyone's faces during the silent film era just feels... different. The movie was directed by Carl Theodor Dreyer, the same guy, who's responsible for Vampyr (1932) to the big screen and I'm starting to feel like his work might be really experimental for the time, at very least it's really clever as the filming techniques used in both The Passion of Joan of Arc and Vampyr are impressive, some of the choices made might be difficult to pull off even for the modern-day cinema. I might be wrong with the last statement, but I just don't feel as impressed in that matter with a lot of modern-day hits, but on the other hand - they have more tools to visually and audibly entertain the viewer.Overall, I was really impressed with the movie, even if writing about it made me write about some unrelated matters that sort-of relate to the figure, whose demise was displayed in the movie - Joan of Arc. Her punishment earns her ceaseless martyrdom and may she forever be remembered as a hero.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Dreyer's Masterpiece features Falconetti's Facial Expressions,"""You cannot know the history of silent film unless you know the face of Renee Maria Falconetti,"" wrote film reviewer Roger Ebert on the unique motion picture by director Carl Theador Dreyer in April 1928's ""The Passion of Joan of Arc.""As the 19-year-old Joan, 35-year-old Falconettie has her face front and center throughout the movie. Dreyer, casting out a large net to find the perfect Joan, spotted Falconetti acting in a comedy on a local Paris stage. A screen test on film verified his hunch. The director remembered he ""found in her face exactly what I wanted for Joan: a country girl, very sincere, but also a woman of suffering.""Dreyer had researched for some 18 months on the leader of the French troops who fought against an occupying English army. The funding studio, France's Society Generale des Films, provided the director a script, which upon first reading, Dreyer tore. He decided to incorporate the actual testimony of her fateful trial as the basis for his film. He condensed the lengthy trial into an abbreviated one day on the screen. Earlier, the French studio agreed to the director's initial wishes by building a very expensive replica of 1400s Rouen, France, complete with wall towers, a chapel, a church's court and concrete walls thick enough to support a number of actors. Big mistake. Dreyer was so enamored by Falconetti's striking facial expressions he decided to forgo all the elaborate historical surroundings. He felt such a cityscape would detract from the intimacy of his characters and made the bold decision to film mainly closeups on the trial's participants faces, mostly shot with his camera low looking upwards.To say the Society Generale des Films was upset at the large construction expenditures being wasted was an understatement. The studio had hired Dreyer on the basis of his previous film, the Danish movie, 1925's 'Master of the House,' and had acquiesced on his demands while he doing his research on Joan of Arc that it build an entire medieval village. The final result of ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" was a unique look never seen on the screen before, and rarely, with this amount of intensity on actors' faces, was ever seen again.There's conflicting reports of how Dryer got Falconetti to show the reaction of each of the trial interrogators' questions and decisions. One account has the director forcing the actress to kneel with no kneepads on a stone so her inner pain would be expressed on her face. Others say he repeatedly cleared the set, with just the cameraman, who focused on her face for crucial reaction scenes. Dreyer said a director ""must be careful never to force his own interpretation on an actor, because an actor cannot create truth and pure emotions on command. One cannot push feelings out. They have to arise from themselves."" An observer noted, ""Dreyer and Falconetti would watch the rushes of a single scene together, seven or eight times, until Dreyer could pick out a little bit, maybe a few feet, where the effect was what they wanted, and when they reshot the scene, she could play it without the least inhibition. Just those few feet of film had inspired her.""The director was searching for realism in his actors, ordering that none wear face makeup: the more worts and wrinkles on a character's skin, the better. He also filmed the inquisitors in bright light, with harsher black and white contrasts, while Falconetti was given the softer gray treatment. This is to show the judges possess a diseased inner life while Joan displays a saintly aura surrounding her.Because of the sensitivities of the largely Catholic French nation, ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" was greeted with a round of censor cuts, much to the director's chagrin. Dreyer did make a second version of the film, restoring some of the government's cuts. When it was released, critics labeled it as one of cinema's greatest masterpieces. But the film was banned in Britain, with its authorities claiming the portrayal of the English soldiers paralleled those of the Romans during Jesus' time. ""The Passion of Joan of Arc,"" turned out to be a flop in the theaters, and the Society Generale Studio canceled its contract with Dreyer for future films. He ended up suing the studio, claiming it mutilated his original movie to please the censors. He couldn't direct another movie until the suit was settled in late 1931.As history has proven, ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" is praised as one of the all-time greats in cinema. The Village Voice named it the eighth best film in the 20th century. A number of noted filmmakers, including Michael Mann and Walter Salles, claimed to have been influenced by the movie. Film critic Pauline Kael called Falconetti's portrayal of Joan as ""maybe the finest performance ever recorded on film.""As for Falconetti, who had appeared in only one minor movie in 1917, she returned to the stage as an actress and a producer, feeling there was no future for her in film. She fled France during World War Two, and ended up in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Gaining weight, she went on a self-imposed restrictive diet. The actress,suffering from depression all her life, committed suicide in 1946 at the age of 54.",9.0,Anonymous,History

A brilliant anomaly,"Ingmar Bergman once said that ""The close-up, the correctly illuminated, directed and acted close-up of an actor is and remains the height of cinematography."". Bergman said it, Dreyer did it. In his film ""La passion de Jeanne d'Arc"" he tells the story mainly through facial expressions. In this film their are no establishing shots, only close ups. Everything that could distract from the faces has been eliminated. No make up, a set consisting of only white walls (which in reality were painted pink so that the color in black and white would be right) , no music and last but not least a story that exclusively focuses on the trial of Jeanne d'Arc and not on the battles that preceded the trial. The Dryer film is something completely different than the ""Joan of Arc"" (1999) from Luc Besson.For the film a very expensive set was build. Because the film only uses close ups, very little of this set is visible in the completed movie. The investors were not amused, but according to Dryer the set helped the actors to give a better performance.The cinematography was also an essential part of this film. The interrogators of Joan were filmed from a low angle and in high contrast lighting. This way they would appear more intimidating. Joan, on the other hand, would be filmed from high angle and using soft lighting. The use of the different camera angles would also have the effect that the little glimpses of the set that are visible are claustrophobic and spatially strange. This reminds us of Germen expressionismDid Dreyer succeed in his experiment? ""La passion de Jeanne d'Arc"" is not the most thrilling film I ever saw. Given the restrictions Dreyer imposed on himself it is however a miracle I remained fascinated during the whole movie. I thus agree with the classification of this film as a ""brilliant anomaly"". Anomaly because no one after Dreyer followed his footsteps. Sergei Eisenstein also frequenly used extreme close ups, but never for a whole movie.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Closeups are used extensively, and convey emotional twists and turns perfectly. Maybe it is shaven-haired Falconetti: for it is her film. Falconetti is inspirational, compelling. Without having seen this film, her picture hung on my wall for years, such was its power to provoke. No one else is as photogenic as is Falconetti in this role.

This movie is Powerful!,"Before I even watched this film, I already knew joan's story, read her story, watched documentaries, saw priests and theologians talking about her, and as I got to know her I ended up creating more and more respect for her, regardless of her belief or disbelief I think we agree on the importance of this woman in the history of France, and why she is one of the greatest symbols of endurance and resilience.I ask for a space to talk a little of my beliefs for a moment. After I came to have more faith in Christ and a closeness to Catholicism, I came to understand that it was through Joan of Arc, I believe that this saint intercedes for me to this day, so that I may reach higher levels of faith and at the end of my life rest in Christ.So, since she is such an important figure to me I decided to watch her films, which I admit I hesitated for a good time, since in recent decades we had dozens of religious films that did not mind being really good movies, or worse, treated the faith of a Christian as something that came out of nowhere, without reason or reason , and anyone who truly believes in God knows that these representations of the Christian faith are very poor.Anyway I decided to start with the most praised, studied and debated by moviegoers throughout history.I watched a completely mute version, just the film and its lines of dialogue, and I must say that it was a powerful experience, I am to this moment perplexed by every second I saw, the emotions that Joana felt defined mine, I felt close to the character, as if I were in the same situation as her.The threat that those judges face is almost demonic, even if someone who was a saint (which was Joan's case) would question whether he is really guilty of something or would think of surrendering to false accusations just to get rid of that threatening environment.And the performance of Maria Falconetti deserves all the applause of those who watch, this woman delivered everything of herself for this film, all the expressions that conveys the emotions of the character, be it a tear of suffering, a look at the sky representing her faith, a finger pointing that shows her resistance, or a small smile that exudes passion. If the character didn't even have a line in the entire movie, we'd still capture everything that's passed on screen.The film gains even more merits by choosing the documents and historical records that were preserved from that time, especially in the trial of Joana, making it believable even for those who do not believe in the religious part of history, director Carl Dreyer was very smart the religious vision to the look of Joana, which we can perceive with its symbolisms, for example the window with a cross shape.The most interesting after the end of this film was that, I do not feel like watching any of the others, not because I believe they are bad but because I believe it is difficult to overcome the impact that this had on me, eventually I will watch them of course, but I am fully sure that 'La passion de Jeanne d'Arc' is the definitive work on this saint of which I have so much affection.And if I may be religious again in my analysis, ora pro nobis Jeanne, di vivere Christus rex!",10.0,Anonymous,History

A truly beautiful film,"The Passion of Joan of Arc is a 1928, French silent film directed by Carl Theodor Dreyer. The cast is fronted by Maria Falconetti, but also stars Eugene Silvain, and André Berley. This film has a very interesting history, including being thought to have been lost for 50 years or so. This was also Falconetti's first, and final film of her life. She lived for 18 years afterward, but she just never starred in any films again. It just goes to show that some of the best art or film is unsuspecting. I'm glad to say that this film is tragically beautiful.
Let me first address what makes this movie; Maria Falconetti. This is one of the best, if not the best performance I have ever seen. I might almost say the best because she perfectly uses her face to express all of her emotions. You know what she is thinking, what she fears, what she hopes. She stares at the ceiling as if she is pleading with god, trying not to question her faith. I could only ever imagine this film as a silent one since the performance by Falconetti is just so passionate and breathtaking. The other performances are also good of course too, especially the young priest who has a very memorable scene with Joan. In other words, the performance from Falconetti and company is worth it in itself.
Secondly, the cinematography and photography went absolutely hand in hand with the performances. There were many shots where I got goosebumps, or where you could pause and write an essay about that still image. Almost every shot of Joan is a close up, and it works excellently. It just shows you don't need a big budget to get shots with such beauty and emotion.
The performances and cinematography are amazing, but all the other aspects are at least I would say ""good"". The story is pretty simple, but that is all we need for this experience. The pacing is just right, transitioning right when scenes would lose their light. The set's are I would say good for the time, but nothing spectacular, but it doesn't need that. Most of the music is harrowing but in a sense mystical at times. The only little problem I have is that sometimes solo male voices in the music kinda broke immersion for a second. This was only because they were so prominent that it took my attention off of the scene, instead of blending with it.
If you're reading this by now you're either really love it like me, or are very very interested. So all there is I need to say is that this movie is in the film hall of fame for me. It just left me thinking all night, and was a truly beautiful film. It also showcases one of the best performances in film of all time by Falconetti. May she rest in peace.",10.0,Anonymous,History

The Passion of Joan of Arc,"The Passion of Joan of Arc is about a woman who is put on trial. Religion and corruption run amok in this classic movie, with Joan being a religious fanatic and The Church ironically putting her up for trial for that very reason. What unravels is a meticulously paced film that, hopefully, should delight viewers.The film is completely silent and black and white, unless you listen to it with Voices of Lights, a orchestra that performed just for this movie. I have not watched Joan of Arc with it, but it is highly acclaimed. Renée Falconetti is the leading woman and gives one the most amazing performs, despite not talking. This is because the film is shot in almost all close ups, and she portrays such brutal emotions throughout the movie. By now most people know how this film ends, but it still comes has a shock, and so does the whole movie.Joan of Arc will leave you speechless, and the director, Carl Th.

Film as a Religious Experience,"Film is largely a religious experience. So when the narrative of a film itself pertains to a religious experience, it is doubly engrossing and cinematic.What interests me here is Falconetti's face and how Dreyer uses his camera to paint that face. Faces are purely cinematic, perhaps the most cinematic things that have yet to be experimented with, probably because they are the most human. Falconetti's face is real beauty. Pure expression and conveyance.The camera. It is static when painting Falconetti. It is moving, sliding, sideward-dollying when painting her persecutors. Falconetti is the fulcrum or the center-point, and the others are painted in a dizzying blur surrounding her that conveys the nature of the experience.According to my ideas this is pure cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"The trial of Jeanne d'Arc, very close up.","when you think of a Jeanne d'Arc movie, you don't expect to see a movie based purely- and focusing just on the trial of Jeanne d'Arc. considering the entire life-story of Jeanne d'Arc, it just doesn't seem like the most likely and interesting thing to focus on. It however of course works well for a more deep, serious and realistic approach and or course also in an original way of retelling the story of Jeanne d'Arc. So don't expect to see a strong heroic female lead but a betrayed, broken, emotional one instead.On top of that, it's a very artistic shot movie, which helps to at all times keep the movie interesting and great to watch.I'd say that about 70% of the entire movie consist out of close-ups. The faces and facial expressions really tell the story of the movie. The movie was also originally intended to be released without any music, to even more empathize on the faces.All of the original shots of the movie were considered destroyed and lost forever before release, which forced the director to completely re-make the movie through re-edits of previously rejected shots. But also this versions got soon destroyed by fire. Therefor this movie was long considered a completely lost one, until an original Danish copy of the movie was found again in 1981, in perfect condition, in out of all places, the closet of the janitor in mental institution in Oslo. How weird is that? Stories like this of course also contribute to the movie its legacy.By todays standards all of the acting performances within the movie can be described as over-the-top. This sort of acting approach was of course however needed in the silent movie era, to make clear to the viewer what the story and the emotions within the story were.I won't go as far as calling this one of the best silent movie out of history, but it's definitely among the artistic most successful ones!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,History
Incredible!! You MUST See this Film!!!!!!,"I just seen this film last night for the first time on TCM and it was Amazing!Anyone who sees this film and does not like it is beyond me! What really made this film so incredible for was the time is was made.1928!The acting, directing, editing and camera shots are WAY ahead of its time!These are movie making methods American audiences would not see in American movies until the late 1960's and early 1970's and that are missing in most of Hollywood movies today!It blows my mind how a masterpiece 50 years ahead of its time such as ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" was made in 1928 and 77 years later Hollywood still makes crap like ""White Chicks"" and ""From Justin to Kelly""The performance by Maria Falconetti is so stunning that the Academy should just give her an Oscar regardless of the fact her performance was 77 years ago!It was an Honor to have seen this film!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Masterful Photography!,"Starting with Eisenstein's ""Ivan the Terrible,"" I began to be comfortable with these early films and their incredible focus on faces. This is like an 80 minute slide show, using some of the most wonderful expressiveness I have ever seen. I know this could be boring to some, but even in shots that seem repetitious, there are subtle differences that express the absolute summit of emotion. This story has been done so many times and it usually falls on the hopes of the character to express, usually in words, faith. Here Joan is so human and yet so saintly. She is devoted to her faith but also afraid. We need to remember that this person came from humble beginnings, unable to even read. Perhaps she was delusional. Personally, I have trouble with any of this, but she certainly could not be more heroic. When she recants her confession, she does so in the shadow of the stake. I was intrigued by the soldiers and the villagers at the end. Did this really happen? I don't recall this in other treatments though I may have forgotten. It is also wonderful that this film was restored. It is crisp and bright and needs to be to show every wrinkle of its characters.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Hard to Believe the Film was Made in 1928,"While director Carl Theodor Dreyer is probably religiously motivated, the persistent usage of Joan of Arc's and the evil judges' Close Ups, which must be exceptionally innovative and progressive at the time, suitably conveys Joan of Arc's emotional intensity. Towards the end, several incredible external panning/tilting shots from extreme angles culminate the audience's emotion to the apex. It is hard to believe that the film was made in 1928.The version I watched is scored by Richard Einhorn, who blends the Middle Ages-esque melisma with a contemporary post-minimalism taste. The score is composed in 1985 and performed by Anonymous 4, and is impossible to exist as a soundtrack back in 1928, but for the contemporary audience it appropriately accompanies the film.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Every Bit Worthy Of Its Legendary Status,"A powerfully moving & thoroughly compelling biopic that effectively utilises the human face as its storytelling device from the first frame to the last, The Passion of Joan of Arc is a cinematic landmark that still retains a mystical power despite being nearly a century old and also features one of the finest actings ever committed on film.",,Anonymous,History
That Male Attire,"For those who have seen Ingrid Bergman and later on Jean Seberg play the maid of Orleans in other interpretations of the Joan Of Arc story you might well do to take a look at what the French themselves have with their national heroine. The Passion Of Joan Of Arc made at the tail end of silent films give an actress normally associated with comedy a chance to give an astonishing interpretation of the maid. It also gives us the only recorded performance of Maria Falconetti to treasure.Directed and written by Carl Dreyer, the sets are a bare basic item in this film, there only to establish a time and place. We see none of Joan's deeds of heroism, this film only concerns us with her trial and execution. And in an interesting and successful technique the entire film is told in closeups, more closeups than I've ever seen used before in any film. As she's interrogated by the Bishop of Cauchon who was in the pay of England's ally the Duke of Burgundy. The film cuts back and forth to closeup shots of the interrogators and then to Falconetti. Her expressions and her tears even without dialog create the image of the frightened and pure saint like girl just trying to do the right thing and stand by her conviction that she's been singled out to save France.At least to my eye Falconetti bore more than a slight resemblance to Anna Magnani and I'm betting if talkies had been available she would have sounded like her as well.There have been modern interpretations that Joan Of Arc might well have been a lesbian. What was really bothering her accusers was the fact that she was in male attire. Now leaving the question of sexual orientation aside, even if all that Joan was, was a symbol just getting around a battlefield might require the clothing that a soldier might wear. It wouldn't be practical to be wearing a farm dress. And certainly if one was participating in the battle it would be foolish.But the male attire seemed to be what got the accusers going. They harped on it constantly during the interrogation. If this was proof that the Maid was a lesbian, than surely she was in league with satanic forces.Depending on your point of view it could range from Joan actually hearing the voice of God to some hallucinatory ramblings from some kind of native intoxicant. Whatever it was she was convinced they came from heaven and more importantly she convinced others. It's why she remains France's national heroine and why she's such a challenging role for so many actresses. Maybe Meryl Streep will try that one next.Until then Maria Falconetti takes her place alongside Ingrid Bergman and Jean Seberg. Watch them all and compare.",9.0,Anonymous,History
The Best Silent Film Ever Made,"If Mel Gibson hasn't seen this movie, then the similarities between this film and Braveheart and the Passion of the Christ are some of the biggest cinematic coincidences of all time.A stunning, emotional film that barely feels dated and with none of the outrageous or make- up diluted acting that was the staple-point of most other silent films. It is a powerful examination of a martyr told in an extremely humanistic way and evokes many of the same emotions as the martyrdoms in the aforementioned Mel Gibson dramas.The performance of the title character is one of the greatest female performances of all time, and in a film without any sound! An excellent example of film as a timeless piece of fine art.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A French classic,"While I read some of the books related to world cinema I was just stuck on one name because of the pronunciation of it. That name is Carl Theodor Dryer and it was quite alien to me because I was just introduced to world cinemas at that time. When checking his filmography The Passion of Joan of Arc stood at the top position and it is surely a classical work. The film is a silent one, just passed a year since the first talkie enter the cinematic field (The Jazz Singer) but this film has its soul in it. Dryer adapted the story from the transcript of Joan of Arc and he just fits it into the story which has cinematic appeal. The movie is like a congested one in the sense it has a lot of close-up shots which are repetitive in the course of the movie's progression. Dryer framed up the characters in particular spaces without any movement for them and did their performance within that space. The film starts with the trial of Joan by the church and then it shifts to the crucifixion or burnt up of her (in another way from the Passion of Christ). In the end, the movie changes its track and goes into a speedy mood. This is a worth classic and good study material for those who dreamt about cinemas.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Good supporting actors, but a bit tedious","I watched the Video Images 1985 video cassette version.  Image quality was slightly grainy.  Cropping did not appear to be off.  This should give an idea of the technical quality of the release I watched.I have mixed emotions about this film.  On the one hand the facial close ups were pretty, but they got tedious for me, and I do feel that I have a lot of patience with movies.I feel that this movie could have benefitted a great deal from sound. Mainly because in a court room interrogation sound would be useful.  Given that the actors in the film would also have made as good voice actors as they are actors, this could have been very captivating.  As it is I found the most interesting scene to be the torture wheel.  The slower film speed makes it appear abstracted and dreamlike.  The interrogations still have their intense bits, and I feel that the supporting actors contributed very well to the feel of the movie.The main long term artistic merit of the film is the artistic cropping of the close ups of Joan.  The same close ups and cropping were used on Sigourney Weaver in Alien 3.  There is even a head shaving scene in both movies.  Alien 3 seems to be praised mainly for mood and cinematography by other imdb reviewers.  It borrows these from Joan of Arc.  This shows that these devices are still relevant today, which means that Passions of Joan of Arc has framing and set up that are considered good by a general audience today.  This also shows that facial close ups of a woman with a shaved head just do not necessarily make a good movie without substance to back the film up.What back up there is in Joan is excellent.  The story is based on reality which gives it distinctive twists, so plotwise the film is stable.  The actors who make up the court trying Joan are excellent.  They make the film worth watching.My final recommendation is to skip this, unless you like artsy close ups, or have some special reason for viewing it.  It was slow for me at bits, and I doubt that you be captivated by the whole film.  The excellent acting keeps the movie from being to tedious, but it didnÕt pull me in.  This may be due to grainy image quality on the edition I watched, and not due to the film.",,Anonymous,History
The best,"I have read all the other comments and agree with all of the favorable ones. This is the best film I have ever seen. There is not much I can add to what has been said.I was surprised, however, that there wasn't more mention in the comments of the connection of this movie with at least two of Sergei Eisenstein's.The last portion of the movie shows that Dreyer must have seen Potemkin. The similarity to the Odessa steps scene is striking. This is not to take any thing away from Dreyer.I had always thought the Eisenstein's Ivan the Terrible has the most amazing closeups and interesting faces. Having seen this film, I think that Eisenstein must have seen this.Thus, I see a two fold connection between Dreyer and Eisenstein. Dreyer taking from Eisenstein's Potemkin and Eisenstein using Dreyer in Ivan the Terrible.Of course, since both directors are in my cinematic pantheon, it just could be that genius often expresses itself in similar ways.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"If one picture is worth a thousand words, Maria Falconetti's eyes are worth a thousand frames ...","Never had the torment of a woman been as beautifully portrayed, inspiring nothing but pure sympathy, as in Dryer's silent masterpiece, ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"", pure sympathy in the Christian meaning of the word, and I'm not even Christian.I can't describe the emotion that tunnels me through Falconetti's eyes; words are feeble, futile, risible, such a performance can't be praised enough, it's like the divine touch of Joan of Arc really embraced Falconetti, she WAS Joan of Arc reincarnated on celluloid, it's even as if Carl Theodore Dryer traveled in time and shot the real trial of Joan of Arc  I know, this is from Jean Cocteau, but I'm only paraphrasing what is probably the feeling of a vast majority.We will never know how God inspired Joan to resist to the English Invasion during the Hundred Years War, and it's only fitting that this unintelligibility is featured in a silent film. What we see is an ounce of divinity inhabiting the eyes of Falconetti, this life in her eyes is the guiding light that comes from the bottom of her soul, we see but we can't reach it, because Dryer doesn't deify the heroin, not even make a martyr out of her. Indeed, if one word could describe Joan of Arc in the film, it's a vulnerable, poignant and heart-breaking humanity. Her face provides such a wide range of emotions that she hypnotically embodies the weakness of a woman harassed by a bunch of heartless judges, scared to death, scared OF death, yet she stands for her convictions. Her body betrays her emotions, but her eyes resist, her eyes mirror the true strength of her soul: an unflappable faith.Dryer's directorial work also deserves praises for the significant part it plays in the film, if you combine it with the editing and the screenplay. The movie is a period drama, but there are no castles, no riding knights, no feasts, no battles, except for the chaotic execution's aftermath. And the trial is only an excuse for probably the first cinematic character study, centered on one of the most legendary heroin that even graced the course of humanity's history, and God knows not enough women did what Joan did. Joan of Arc defines the very word of heroin as someone who's anything but a victim, choosing her fate, her destiny, not out of bravery but despite her fears. It's easy to die when you're not afraid of dying, but never heroism can be displayed without something precious at stakes. In the case of Joan, how could have she discredited her belief that God came to her ... to save her life?! What was the point of living after that?Like for any hero, there's the pivotal test, when she's subtly lured into signing the infamous paper that would saved her from excommunication, from the bonfire, at her integrity's price. But when she realized she signed out of fear, she immediately retracted and symbolically signed her own death warrant. How could she lie to herself when her eyes breathed the truth in its purest form? This is what the story is about, Joan's passion, a passion transmitted to the crowd when her head was shaved, when she carried the cross, when she burnt on the bonfire. Joan embodied a Christ-like martyrdom, sadder than inspiring, we feel sad because she's human, mortal and vulnerable. For the judges, the crime isn't even blasphemy, it's pretension. They mock her, shout at her, even condescendingly laugh, but there's always one moment where her eyes manage to penetrate the soul of one of them, and for a brief instant, one heart is touched by a sort of ephemeral light betrayed by one imperceptible facial expression.On that department, the movie is a school case. I said it's not a period drama made on a epic scale, it's not even on the scale of a trial film. The whole film is made of countless cuts and close-ups with a close to perfect capability to convey the right feeling. The film is a masterpiece, not just by silent films' standards, it reaches a level of artistic greatness independent from any attempt to tell a story. Look at the film even without that haunting medieval music and you'll still find yourself transported by these eyes, these facial expressions, even the wrinkles on the faces, the severity of a closed mouth, emphasize the nightmarish feeling endured by Joan. The camera is always kept low with the antagonists as to reinforce their powerful position, while Joan is under the camera with her eyes looking in God's direction. Whenever she feels weak, she looks down then turn her eyes to God, at times, her eyes move in every direction, when she's panic-stricken as any 'weak' woman, but ultimately, she recovers the extreme serenity of a privileged human being touched by the divine grace.Yet, at the end, she's still scared, and when she finally meets God, you can tell on people's eyes, the guilt carried on their heart, to have allowed such a martyrdom to happen. What follows is a chaotic violent battle, that leaves us almost emotionless because Falconnetti drained all our emotions, and we're simply exhausted after such an intense and disturbing experience. Again, you can analyze and make all the essays of the world, it always comes to this : Maria Falconetti's performance as Joan of Arc is the soul of the film, and the greatest cinematic performance ever, and the fact that it's her only role, makes it even more legendary, Falconetti and Joan of Arc are almost equally iconic.And in these recent days where the growing success of ""The Artist"" revived the interest for the Silent era, movies like ""Joan of Arc"" are vital to understand how silent films, beyond their nostalgic value, elevated cinema to its truest essence as maybe the most powerful artistic medium, to convey the universal language of the soul.",10.0,Anonymous,History
I'm not even religious...,"and yet I still loved this movie. The music, the camera movements and compositions, and the acting are all simply amazing.It'll be enjoyed more by those people who firmly believe that Joan was in fact sent by God, but there's enough here for the rest of us as well. It is a good movie regardless of what you believe because it draws you into its own world, and keeps you shackled there until the end.If you're the type of person who notices little details in movies, that's definitely a bonus, because there are a lot of visual metaphors (ex. there is a shadow of a window on the floor that looks like a cross. One of the priests steps over it covers it with his shadow). Also, the use of close-ups means that we really notice every single tiny detail of the (mostly) excellent dramatic performances.Score: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,History

Carl Theodor Dreyer's take on the legendary 15th century French teen martyr Joan of Arc,"In 1412, a young girl called Jeanne is born in Domrémy, France. Jeanne develops into a very religious sentiment, and she confesses several times a day. At the age of 13, she has her first vision and years after that, in 1428, she knows her mission is to be ridding France of the English and so sets out to meet Charles, the Dauphin. Later on , Henry VI of England proclaims himself king of France but then Joan of Arc, the peasant girl hears saints' voices telling her the Dauphin Charles claim the French throne and drive out the English . Being nineteen years old , proclaims in Bourges to Charles VII as king, after being crowned in Reims. Charles persuades Joan to proclaim herself the legendary ""Maiden of Lorraine"" and raise an army to battle the Brits . Joan of Arc acting as a divine mission defeats the English army in Orleans. But this ¨La passion de Jeanne d'Arc¨(1928) focuses on the interrogation, the conviction and the execution of the medieval French heroine and saint. On May 23, 1430, Joan of Arc, a 19-year-old maiden, fell into the hands of the Duke of Burgundy. She was sold to the English and dragged to Rouen (capital of the English possessions in France) and was brought before an ecclesiastical court. Joan is placed on trial on charges of heresy. The ecclesiastical jurists attempt to force Jeanne to recant her claims of holy visions. Lord Warwick, the governor of the city, chose the jurors from among the allies of the king of England, in order to secure by all means Joan's death sentence and have her burned in the public square. During the trial, Juana declares that she has fought the English under the inspiration of the archangel Gabriel. Furthermore, she claims that Saint Michael appeared to her with the promise of saving his soul. The court declares her guilty and sentences her to die at the stake.From the minutes of the trial found in the library of the Chamber of Deputies of Paris, Dreyer reconstructs the trial carried out against the young woman in 1431 in the city of Rouen. This is an unforgettable masterpiece in which the impeccable work of the theater actress Maria Falconetti stands out, who gives a terrific performance showing the deep profound pain, extreme suffering and sorrow that Joan of Arc suffered. The decorator Hermann Warm also stands out, along with the dressmaker and the director of photography Rudolph Maté who shortly after emigrated to the USA, achieving great successes both as a cameraman and as a movie director. The motion picture was very well directed by Carl Theodor Dreyer, This famous and classic director was born in Copenhague, Denmark. He was a prestigious writer and filmmaker, known for Gertrud (1964), Vampyr (1932), Ordet (1955) and La passion de Jeanne d'Arc(1928) .Other films about this historic character is as follows : ""Saint Joan""(1957) by Otto Preminger with Jean Seberg , Richard Widmark , Richard Todd and John Gielgud ; ""The trial of Joan of Arc"" (1962) by Robert Bresson with Florence Delay ; ""Joan of Arc"" (1954) by Roberto Rosselini with Ingrid Bergman ; ""Joan of Arc"" by Victor Fleming (1948) with Ingrid Berman , J Carrol Naish , War Bond and Jose Ferrer as Charles VII .

Powerful silent era drama,"The trial and execution of Joan of Arc.Powerful drama. Starts rather tamely, and it seems like the movie could just be a back-and-forth dialogue between Joan and the judges / priests. However, the dialogue is spot-on, and the verbal jousting is wonderful to behold.Great direction by Carl Theodor Dreyer. His use of close-ups is a masterstroke, giving a great intimacy with and engagement to the character of Joan. Quite gritty, realistic direction too. Very graphic for 1926 - the last few scenes are incredibly harrowing.What makes the movie is the performance of Maria Falconetti in the lead role.

Silence That Speaks Louder Than Words.,"When it comes to religious films whose title's begin with ""The Passion"", most people will think of Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ. That is certainly a great movie, but another film should come to mind, that being Carl Dreyer's 1928 silent masterpiece, The Passion of Joan of Arc.Passion, in its original Latin meaning, means ""to suffer"", and in terms of people like Jesus and Joan of Arc, it also refers to their death. As such, The Passion of Joan of Arc's plot focuses on the trial of Joan of Arc, as a heretic in the eyes of France's Catholic Church, for claiming to be sent by God to save France from England.Even at 94 years old, The Passion of Joan of Arc is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. Director Carl Dreyer, most known for making deeply spiritual films, crafts a memorizing portayal of Joan's trial and ultimate death.Despite it earning a 10, there is a minor complaint I have, which still extends to a positive. The movie runs for 81 minutes, and even then, roughly half of the movie is dialogue free. (Note that it is also a silent film.) We see Joan cry, priests and judges debate, Joan walk to her death, all without speaking. As a result, the movie can feel like a slow burn, as if a turtle could move faster.However, Dreyer films in such a way that there is beauty in these slow moments, such as Maria Falconetti (Joan)'s large eyes flowing with tears. So, despite how slow it is, Passion still manages to keep the viewer overall engaged and moved by the picture.In many ways, her death mirror's that of Christ's, as she is put on trial for heresy, spit on, wears a crown likened to the crown of thorns (though she makes it herself in jail), and in the end, she dies a horrfic death for her cause.Maria also does a fascinating job playing Joan, and her pain and sorrow are portayed beautifully. Her thick tears, her large, pierce eyes, and simply put, her soul make for a powerful performance.I've already touched slightly on the look of Passion, and apart from how Joan of Arc is portrayed, it also holds up for a movie from 1928. No film dirt or signs of age (apart from an ancient credit style and glorious black and white footage) are shown, and even 94 years later, the film holds up, even visually.The visuals, emotions and cinematic power of The Passion of Joan of Arc is what makes it one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen, even if it is nearly a century old. Whether you are religious or secular, The Passion of Joan of Arc is a powerful piece of cinema where the silence speaks louder than words.",10.0,Anonymous,History

"A serious, albeit didactic, silent film","When the film opens, Joan of Arc (Renée Jeanne Falconetti) is about to go on trial. She was a girl of about 19 who through visions from the age of 13 she sought to help Charles VII during the Hundred Years War against the English. She had been captures and was on trial for heresy. We see many shots of the crowds and of the main players including the Bishop of Beauvais (Eugène Silvain), the prosecutor (André Berley), and the Dean of Rouen (Antonin Artaud).The movie follows the argument at the trial about her self-perceptions. For a possibly illiterate young woman she gives remarkably nuanced answers to difficult questions. At one point, under extreme pressure she admits her error, but later recants this confession and is condemned to burn at the stake.The cinematography in this film is amazing. It is simple in style, but complex through the extensive use of extreme close-ups both of main characters and the simple folk looking on. This is especially the case with Falconetti. Her facial expressions range from fear to acceptance to pain to confidence and back again. The extended execution scene, while not terribly graphic, is unforgettable both because of the way Dreyer sets up the celebratory crowd that gradually turns against the soldiers. And Falconetti's face registers all one needs to see.If you want to see a serious, albeit didactic, silent film look this one up.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Tremendous, an essential classic in all ways","This is certainly an instance in which the film's reputation - nay, legend - well precedes it. From development to release to censorship, to seeming loss and eventual restoration, there is much to discuss about 'The passion of Joan of Arc' even before considering the content. And with that firmly in mind - this is an outstanding picture. Set design and decoration, and costume design, are deceptively complex and precise. Very particular use of lighting is still more readily impressive, not least of all as it is used to emphasize Joan's perspective or her antagonists' malignance.And then there's the direction: Carl Theodor Dreyer demonstrates keen sensibilities deserving of the movie's renown. There are sparing but pointed uses of tracking, panning, framed shots, or other specific techniques. Much more than anything else, however, Dreyer employs close-ups in his camerawork and shot composition, with many shots tightly focused on a single individual so as to accentuate the subtleties in their countenance, or the details in a set piece, prop, or other especial facet of the production.Indeed, there's much to take in, not least of all with such a fantastic cast to build the picture. In each of Joan's jailers and inquisitors we see the vigor the actors bring to their roles, realizing anger, spite, and mocking confidence that belies terrible cruelty and immense hypocrisy. It's a joy to watch them at play - yet much more than this, it's hard not to be impressed with star Renée Jeanne Falconetti. She embodies Joan with incredible nuanced range besting that of her co-stars, to the point that to an extent it's not wrong to think of 'The passion of Joan of Arc' as a psychological drama, so closely is it centered on her state of mind. Falconetti captures with wonderful capability every ounce of Joan's deep sadness, zealous resolve, and recognition of her mortality, and it is without a doubt an extraordinary display of acting skills, matching or exceeding the best to be found anywhere in the silent era or beyond.Consider, too, themes including the overreach and abuse of power of the Church, misogyny, gender roles, and the way institutional Christianity regards women. Though simple on the surface, there's much to glean from the film, and much that it tries to do. Perhaps a little too much, as the finale runs a little long in the tooth, in my opinion, following Joan's inevitable departure. It's also worth noting that while directly inspired by the historical record of Joan of Arc's trial, the picture is more of a truncated interpretation of the course of events. Still, these are rather minor matters, and don't truly have bearing on the great quality of the feature. For its place in cinema history, let alone on its own merits, this is a superb classic that holds up exceptionally well almost 100 years later. For anyone that enjoys movies generally, and silent movies specifically, 'The passion of Joan of Arc' is an exquisite feature that I should think everyone needs to see at least once.",9.0,Anonymous,History
The Greatest Silent Film Ever Made,"A magnificent film. The story itself so simple yet languorously explored in a series of long tracking shots, close ups, and dutch angled or lopsidedly framed scenes which seem to unfold a presence inside and hovering over Joan and the Church/Civil court proceedings. That presence or inescapable fullness is a marvel of filmmaking. How does one show the presence of what is unseen in a visual medium? Ironically the answer for Dreyer is often, to film nothing in particular and detach the camera from what the eye most wants to see.For those not familiar with the story portrayed in the film, Joan is accused by the English of heresy and blasphemy, claiming that God has sent her an angel, commanding her to lead an army of the French to defeat the English. Of course to the English this seems impossible because that implies that God loves the French more than the English and so the question her, attempt to trick her, and even torture her before she is eventually executed by fire.For a movie without sound, it is remarkably easy, through the performances, to interpret the roles of each of the court officials and priests as well as what degree to which they sympathize or abhor Joan. It is a testament to the development of cinephilic language to which Dreyer contributed that with the aid of only a sparse use of title cards, the audience is not only never lost but somehow transported into the bare court which Joan of Arc was forced to endure. I never felt like I was just watching something happen. I felt more like I was in the crowd, sitting next to a wicked priest condemning her, in her stead as she approached the instruments of torture, or even a member of the crowd, come to watch her death. That is quite a feat in a film where there is no sound to aid in that immersion.That isn't to say that it isn't work on the viewer's part. Intentionally, I think, Dreyer has directed a film in which you must be an active participant. It is easy to wander off in your mind or find yourself glancing down at your text messages. Just as Joan must actively submit herself to her death, we the viewer must make an effort to join her.For this reason, I find this film to be an excellent companion during this particular time of the year: Lent. During a season in which we deny ourselves forms of comfort and go beyond mere attempts to 'not commit sins' and find knew levels of resolve, weakness, and faith, I am reminded of how easily I stumble, even as Joan does, and hope that I may too, endure whatever trials I will face.It is a constant reminder that the faith which men may see as silly or weak is in fact, as Marcus Vinicius of ""Quo Vadis"" claims, a faith of courage.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"The ""St Matthew Passion"" of Silents","Remember when in ""Sunset Boulevard,"" Norma Desmond asserted that in her era, the silent era, ""They had faces!""  Well, this film certainly has faces. Carl Theodore Dreyer's ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" indeed ends the silent era on a high note by projecting, like none before, its strongest attribute - the visual.In a way, this is how Bach brought the baroque era in music to its culmination.  Once he had made his statement, there was nothing left to say. I think the same can be said about Dreyer and his ""Passion""Moreover, I think Dreyer's ""Passion"" can be compared to Bach's ""St. Matthew Passion"". Both were created by Lutherans, who took their religion seriously. Bach used music as the idiom of his devotion, as I think Dreyer did with film. In fact, Dreyer's frustrated ambition was to make a Life of Christ, which he had finally begun just before his death. I would suggest, that what we are seeing in ""Joan of Arc"" and Dreyer's other films is - as we are hearing in Bach's music - the passion of a great master.By the way, Pauline Kael says that Falconetti's Joan may be the greatest performance by an actress ever filmed.",,Anonymous,History
"Possibly the Greatest Film Ever Made, Still","When a medium is only twenty years old, what does it mean to be called the best of that medium? When The Passion of Joan of Arc was released, narrative film was really only about 20 years old. It's seems like a paltry selection of films from which to pull the best ever. I suppose the closest corollary in my lifetime would be video games. Mass consumer video games seem to have a birth in the late 70s and early 80s. When a game came out in the late 90s and early 00s that was considered one of the best ever, at the time, how long will that opinion last? Will people who play games in 2080 still consider that game to be one of the greatest ever?
Such questions come to me when thinking about the reception The Passion of Joan of Arc received upon its release. I've read contemporaneous reviews that called it the greatest film ever made. Seems like a small feat when compared to a movie called greatest ever now, with 90 more years of films to deal with.
And yet, I don't think anything has changed about this film's place at the height of cinema.
Film as an Emotional Medium
To really begin, here's a link to the entire movie with the Voices of Light soundtrack. Do yourself a favor, especially if you've never seen this movie, and at least bookmark it to watch at some point.joan2Film is really primarily an emotional experience. Storytelling in general asks people to connect with fictional characters, to understand who they are and why they do what they do. That's particularly strong in film because we actually see people's faces as they go through events.
The use of faces in The Passion of Joan of Arc is particularly important. Whenever people talk about this movie, the one thing that comes up most is the central performance by Renee Folconetti. She was a stage actress who had never worked in film before. She would also never work in film again. Part of that is probably because of what we actually see in the movie. She's obviously emotionally distressed, and there are stories that the direct, Carl Theodore Dreyer, pretty much tortured her to get the performance, and it was wildly effective.
Joan's eyes are wide with innocence as she navigates her interrogators' questions, making them seem alternatively foolish and unserious. It's both Joan's strength and fragility, all told through Falconetti's performance, that sells the conflict. We are with her from the beginning to the end, and it's quite an emotional journey.
Experimentaljoan3I revisited the movie for this post and I had completely forgotten how much the camera moves. I don't know about you, but when I think of silent filmmaking, I imagine hand-cranked cameras on tripods. The cameras used in The Passion of Joan of Arc were hand-cranked, but it feels like they were never on tripods.
The camera swings around, back and forth, and is always pushed right into actors' faces. The production company actually spent a significant amount of money building an entire French medieval town for the film, and they were angry at Dreyer because the audience barely sees it. The movie has wider shots here and there, but the story is almost entirely told in close-up, and often at off angles.
For those who think that filmmakers never really got inventive until that one movie that speaks to them personally but was released in the late 90s and they watched at a formative time, it's interesting to see them take in the fast editing and fun camera work in a movie from the 20s.
Preservationjoan4I provided a link earlier to a free streaming version of the film. If you do just go over and watch the first few minutes, there's a bit (the copy is from the Criterion collection version) that includes a brief history of the film, including the fact that the original version was considered lost for decades.
I can't find any images of the comparison, but one difference between the cut Dreyer cobbled together after the original negative went up in flames and the one we have today is in a scene late in the movie where Joan gets blood-let. First of all, it's an actual arm, an actual knife, and actual blood. And they did it twice, to the same person (apparently not Falconetti), within minutes.The first version is what's in the restored, original cut. The spray is strong and jumps out of her arm. In the cobbled together cut, the spray is much less powerful. (I know I've seen that alternate take, and I think it's on the Criterion DVD as an extra, but I'm not reorganizing my attic to find it. I have the ripped version of the movie on my hard drive, and that's going to be good enough for now.)
I don't place film preservation on the same level of importance as someone like Martin Scorsese (whose movie Hugo is a celebration of film preservation), but The Passion of Joan of Arc and the fact that it was completely lost for decades, and could have been lost forever, tells me of the effort's importance. I never want to see that cobbled cut with alternate takes for everything. It's not what Dreyer had decided was the best representation of the film he had made. It was a lesser version. I'd never want that.
Greatest Ever
I only order my Top Ten based on either time or alphabetically. I'm not interested in pitting movie 5 and 6 against each other. I just want to celebrate them both.
The one exception to that rule would probably be this. I think that if I were to ever actually order the list from best to least best, The Passion of Joan of Arc would be number 1.

Not like looking oneself in a mirror,"This movie is looking at someone dying and suffering, not as a martyr, but as someone who's in synch with nature, and nature is, as everyone around you will tell, oh so gay.One has to look at earthquakes, thunder, rain, sun, etc to see the potential force of nature.A human being is part of nature, from it's birth, until it's death, despite all the robots around, a human has a potential for great, wonderful, beautiful.The word is: potential.Joan was lured by nature, by this 'other' thing which is NOT like looking oneself in a mirror.Joan of Arc was NOT Alice in Wonderland, but she might have heard her voices.The judges in the movie are a metaphor for society in modern America/Europe and co.The newborns, filled with life, and the schizophrenic dads and moms surrounding those newborns who, instead of being unhappy with a metaphor, a situation, a general grim state of things (meaning EVERYONE around) take it on their children's.Joan of Arc is the only, the sole, the unique reason many people don't go around shooting at everyone in the street.

Grossly underrated,"Given the title, you might think I wrote this just to praise the creation.Well it's not just that. One has to say the film is very theatrical, but that makes every scene a painting in itself, and the camera angles and the empty scenery is there to emphasize the messages.The fact that the movie was heavily influenced by the transcript of the actual events, can be seen in small details which today may not be in the knowledge of the public, or at least were not known to me.From my experience in movie arrangements, not many directors have managed to use the scene as good, better for this can surely be named a number of Russians and Nippons, but not the mainstream Western directors, with the mention of Bergman.This is a movie to be seen, for the power it transmits the message without words, and might have lost that power if sound was present.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Grace, hope, and passion","""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" by Carl T. Dryer is approaching its centennial celebration. For a silent film that is almost 100 years old, it is incredible how modern, compelling, and visually pleasing it still is. Indeed, it is easily one of the greatest movies ever made. The remastered cut available on streaming platforms is worth seeing. Not a single shot is wasted: the skewed angles, closeups, and quick cuts are used to highlight the secular and emotional terror of the young martyred saint, but also her stark devotion and blessedness. Renée Maria Falconetti's performance is appropriately otherworldly and expressive. But the rest of the cast are also fantastic, from the self-congratulatory, hypocritical, and corrupted clergymen to the sympathetic bystanders and conflicted co-executioners. Antonin Artaud, too, makes a memorable guest appearance. The faces of each character reveal subtle nuances and a deep inner life that is captured with scientific accuracy. Although most of the movie takes place in and around the inquisitorial chambers (in a magnificent set constructed just for the film), the final dark crescendo outside, culminating in her martyrdom, also includes some impressive crowd shots and action scenes. But towering above it all - with the birds, clouds, and the divine victory - radiate her grace and hope in the face of the unforgivable. Catharsis belongs to the peasants and lords alike - and spiritually more to the former. I have not seen another movie like this, and I love it - like she loved God - to death.

Mesmerizing silent classic,"The film focuses on the trial of French saint and icon, Joan of Arc, a young girl who helped France win several victories during The Hundred Years War in the Middle Ages.Now imprisoned by the English and on trial for heresy by a group of clergymen, Joan fights to justify and defend both her faith and her unique gift. However, the clergy are determined to break her at any cost.Leading the charge is Maria Falconetti as Joan, who captures just how out of her depth and terrified Joan is in this situation, often with a distraught look on her face, while still giving the role a sense of dignity and commitment, much like Joan's to her faith. The supporting cast is made up of the various clergy and guards, most of whom are of older age, and enhanced by the black and white, giving their pock-marked faces an almost demonic feel. They almost become living gargoyles, and only enhance further just how isolated and helpless our lead is.On a technical level, Dreyer goes for an unorthodox approach for the time.If you've seen any silent films, or just glanced at pictures, they often have the camera pulled far back, more akin to recording a stage show. However, Dreyer goes up close and personal, often utilizing close-ups to give a claustrophobic feel, and combined with some sharp lighting and the lack of make-up on the actors, create an uncomfortable and tense atmosphere. Musically, the film has never had an officially confirmed soundtrack, so there exist many versions. The one I'm basing this review on is the Criterion version, which uses Richard Einhorn oratorio 'Voices of Light', a haunting choral piece that compliments the religious themes and imagery perfectly and adds a surreal dimension to Dreyer's uncomfortable visuals, turning the film into a sensory experience that envelops you utterly.Naturally, with no spoken dialogue, most of the narrative has to be conveyed by the actors and a couple of title cards here and there. However, don't be fooled by what may sound this archaic: it's actually very effective. The reason being is quite simple: it's a very emotional story, both in terms of reaction as well as presentation. There is an almost beautiful directness that perfectly lets in on how our characters, mainly Joan, feel and think as the trial goes on. Simple nods of the head or movement of eyes tell us what, often times, dialogue can't or if it tries, it's not very effective. Furthermore, it allows us to inhabit Joan's skin and feel what she feels. This is especially poignant when the camera is not on her, and because of the near constant close-ups, you almost begin to feel like you're the one on trial, surrounded by all this angry men. It really cranks up the tension and unease as you watch, which is, frankly, really impressive for a film this old.What's more, despite the presence of religion, it's not that mystical or fantastical. Rather, the film is more about belief, and how it can be wielded: Joan's belief in her divinity, the clergy's belief in her heresy, the belief Joan instills in others, who may or may not betray her as the story goes on. Regardless if God is real or not, it's the fact that Joan's faith is so incredibly strong that she ultimately is willing to die for it that is the core of the story. This is enhanced by the fact that she isn't some kind of super-woman: Joan does get frightened, and even at one point, comes close to completely breaking down when the pressure gets to her, allowing us to see the human being behind the legend.However, there are gripes. As I mentioned before, this particular version's musical score can be a little overpowering at times, but even watching a different version, there are still some little 'hiccups'. The clergy, though effectively intimidating, are not much more than one-dimensional villains, and little is made of the richness that is the debate of which side truly knows more about Christianity and faith, though you can write it off as simply being constricted by the time the film was made in. It's well worth at least one viewing for both aficionados of this era, as well as newcomers to film history",8.0,Anonymous,History

This is a perfect film,"I love Jeanne d'Arc, the patron saint of soldiers.Before I saw this film, I had always considered 'The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc' to be the epitome of Jeanne d'Arc's story on film.When I found out about this film a few years later, I only watched it because of my love for Jeanne d'Arc. But I didn't think a silent black and white film from the 1920s would be able to stand up to a modern film. When it was over, I stood corrected, because The Passion of Joan of Arc proved to be one of the most powerful and moving films of all time.The incredible performances of Maria Falconetti (Jeanne), and every actor in the film was beyond perfect. The way they conveyed emotion through expression, and used their body language to speak volumes in this silent film, took hold of and captivated me. The camera work and settings were obviously far beyond their time. The director was truly a visionary. I completely fell in love with the film, and, for me at least, it became the pinnacle of Jeanne d'Arc's story on film.When I researched about the history of this film, it turns out we're very fortunate to have this film with us today. As It was almost lost to history.

Forces Of Darkness,"Historically compressed, this reenactment of the trial and subsequent murder of French martyr Jeanne d'Arc (Maria Falconetti) is a famous silent film that has had a torturous past. The film was initially censored. Then the negative was destroyed. A second negative somehow survived but went undiscovered for fifty years.The film is unusual in several regards. First, it has very little action. A big part of the film is the interrogation of Jeanne by Church hierarchy, hostile old men who fear her dedication and inner conviction. Second, camera shots are mostly close-ups, or of medium range. This strips images of background distractions in the interrogation sessions. Props and scenery are thus either absent or largely irrelevant.The only consideration is the interplay between Jeanne and her tormentors. Camera lighting is bright when focused on the faces of the monks and judges. And none of the actors wore makeup, another unusual trait of this film. The visuals thus present these men as forces of darkness, looking hideous, barbaric, and cruel, unable to hide behind their righteousness or religious ritual.By contrast, Jeanne comes across as sincere, courageous, honest, and unwavering in her convictions. Falconetti gives a really fine performance. Some critics regard it as one of the greatest performances in film history. Falconetti seems to have the ability to cry on cue.After the interrogation, Jeanne is led outdoors where she is roped to a stake. The townsfolk gather to watch. Their sympathies, judged by their crying and grim faces, clearly side with Jeanne. The film's climax is uncompromising. The images at the end are quite potent.This is a true story of a lone individual up against an arrogant, institutional bully. No wonder Jeanne d'Arc is now regarded as a Saint. The DVD provides a couple of options for watching this silent film: one with no sound at all, the other with the ""Voices of Light"" music track. I prefer the latter because the classical music instills a sense of historical majesty and grandeur to this simple, but powerful film.",,Anonymous,History
A Classic devastating story of spiritual faith causing death and alternatively Freedom.,"THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC (1928) :BRIEF REVIEW (REMASTERED VERSION) -A Classic devastating story of spiritual faith causing death and alternatively Freedom. This is probably the only Frech film from 20s decade i have seen so i don't exactly know what kind of level French Cinema had acquired by the time. However, i have seen some other classic films from the decade so i better go with comparing this one to those. Hereby, i say The Passion Of Joan Of Arc is a Classic storytelling of a devastating tale of a Legendary Heroine Figure in France History. In 1431, Jeanne d'Arc is placed on trial on charges of heresy. The ecclesiastical jurists attempt to force Jeanne to recant her claims of holy visions but she declines and seeks a salvation through ultimatum of Death. The story itself is very passionate and dedicated yet it has too much of spiritual thoughts. It shows that, yes the death could be an alternate freedom and may be that's how you repent your sins. I liked these thoughts already but i liked it more when it all came in artistic form like facial Expressions, atmosphere, tension and background music. I believe, that was a golden era for Cinema World when silence and expressions used to speak clearer and louder than Voiced Dialogues because then makers had to think about how to express the scene on screen how to bring conviction, how to build the interest rather than making it verbal which happened later in Talkies era. And i must say Director Carl Theodor Dreye brought that conviction without exaggerating anything. Simplicity is the Key here. In the lead role Falconetti delivered one of the most memorable performance for any actress in silence era. Her eyes, her expressions, her pain everything was amazing and wonderful. Overall, The Passion Of Joan Of Arc CLASSIC FILM which carries a Timeless Legacy and surely set a benchmark for Biography genre.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",8.0,Anonymous,History

This had the added speedbump of the titles being in Danish. At least the version I watched. And yes I know it's French. Also note the version I watched had no sound at all.
It was not perfect by any means. It had more close ups than any movie ever made. It was a bit much I thought.
Like many silent movies, the acting can be overly gestured at times.
However it was still impressive in many ways. Falconetti was riveting in an amazing performance.
And that ending was simply unforgettable.

Great powerful classic,"The film is beautiful in every respect, from its cinematography's focus on extreme close-ups, its supporting character performances and even the few moments you truly glance at the set design and decorations. It all contributes wonderfully to Dreyer's vision of the trial of Joan of Arc, but the highlight for me, along with many other viewers, is certainly Falconetti's performance. It's honestly heartbreaking when the inevitably tragic ending is portrayed as for the brief time we, as viewers, have been watching the film, it certainly feels like we have got to know who both Jeanne d'Arc and Falconetti are and that she has opened herself up to the world - her performance is one of the most genuine performances I've ever had the pleasure of viewing.I definitely recommend this film, whether you're curious about acting, cinematography or silent cinema, this should definitely be essential viewing.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Joan's Pain, Power's Hypocrisy, and the Eternal Triumph of the Human Spirit","The Passion of Joan of Arc is truly a masterpiece, captivating not only for its depth but also for the brilliance of its cinematic language. The film, based on the actual trial records of Joan of Arc, unfolds as a tragedy of faith, youth, and purity clashing with the cynicism, hypocrisy, and brutality of power.One of the film's key features is its use of close-ups. Dreyer employs them not just as a technical tool but as a means of conveying the inner worlds of the characters. Joan's face, filled with pain and serenity, is contrasted with the faces of the judges and executioners, marked by cold cruelty and even depravity. The camera penetrates into the souls of the characters, exposing their true motives and fears.The hypocrisy of the clergy is a central theme. The judges, hiding behind sacred texts, attempt to break Joan's spirit. They act as Pharisees, performing rituals to maintain their power rather than seeking justice. This is especially evident in scenes where a young priest, initially doubtful of the trial's righteousness, gradually succumbs to the pressure of his older colleagues. This generational contrast symbolizes the conflict between the desire for change and the conservative fear of it.Dreyer pays immense attention to detail, from the set design to the actors' gestures. Every scene feels deliberate and symbolic. Notably, the executioners are portrayed not only as enforcers of the sentence but as people deriving perverse pleasure from their work.The film resonates unexpectedly with the modern era. Joan's image as a fighter for truth and justice evokes comparisons to figures like Alexei Navalny and others standing against repressive systems. The dispersal of protests and trials of activists remind us that history, unfortunately, repeats itself.The Passion of Joan of Arc is not just a movie. It is a work of art that compels viewers to reflect on timeless questions of faith, power, and the human spirit.",10.0,Anonymous,History

"It's Not Just the Film, but the Whole Experience","This movie is hard to study just as a film, but is easier to study as a film-experience. The film itself, has a few problems and probably deserves a ""C"". It does have some great composition shots, great framing and excellent positioning of the characters. Some of it could have been highly influenced by the ""Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" (1920). The best shot is the one of Joan in front of the cross during her second sentencing. In the finale, in the scene with the stake, the imagery is terrifying and believable too. There are some offshoot mistakes, where you can see the top or side or creases in the set walls, but nothing awful. The film itself probably would have been better if it was shortened just a little.There is also a very interesting feeling of early lesbian persecution by the religious judges that I feel captured the mythos of Joan of Arc. The short hair, the guards having fun with her and tormenting her with the crown and arrow. Making her look like she is a freak, the religious persecution and calling her a monster, all gave a hint of early, unfair, paranoid, prejudices that we still see even today and from what I understood about Joan of Arc, may have been very accurate.And, talk about images of emotional angst. Every supporting character, with a long close-up shot, looks amazingly framed. You feel the emotions just rolling out of each person, that Carl Dreyer's camera touches. Which brings me to Falconetti. I really feel bad talking about her performance, considering the woman went nuts afterwards, because she immersed herself into the roll too deep. It drove her mad and she became a recluse and apparently died young. It is sad and I fear her performance may have been too deep and from what I have read annoyingly so.Which also brings me to the ""film-experience"" thing I mentioned before. If you watch this film and add in the life of Joan of Arc, the film itself, the post film life of Falconetti and the remarkable journey that the film itself took after the initial 1928 release, than the film is an ""A"". The amazing parallel directions that all four of these aspects actually take is frightening. The similarities between the mythos of Joan of Arc and the life of Falconetti was creepy. The film itself, thought lost forever, enjoyed a reincarnation, of sorts, or a second chance. In fact if someone wanted to make a movie or TV mini-series about the whole ball of wax I think it would be pretty cool. It is this aspect that makes me split the difference and I will settle with a ""B"". By the way, did they really have scissors back then?8.1 (B MyGrade) = 8 IMDB.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Her EYES....,"I haven't seen many silent films, they always seemed remote & dull, unable to muster the kind of sensory battering 21st Century Schizoid Men like us are used to. I've begun to see hyper kinetic visuals as lazy and impoverished in their own way, though. Mellower efforts from bygone eras offer much on their own terms. Not so much boring & old as...different. Like reading a book a silent film lets more of your own imagination fill in the blanks; there's more participation. I think that's key to helping people feel less numbed-out by all the excess stimulation now but that's for another rant.A filmed interpretation of the final days of Joan of Arc, this movie just *has* to come up in a lot of feminist classes. The whole thing is the prolonged torture of an innocent maiden, her refinement & beautification through pain lovingly administered by the Man.It just wouldn't work as a modern movie either,the dreamy disconnect of all silent flicks is essential in maintaining the strange religious hysteria without the stark repugnance of the situation overwhelming it.The spot-on music & Maria Falconetti's mesmerizing features evoke real intensity; who knew silent films could be so moving? (Then again,I thought that once then saw ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT).So little actually happens just the camera lingering on the agonized reactions of our heroine with haunting choral music plugging away in the background. It gets at something pure few movies today would.So intimate, so epic. There's an undeniable awe, all from lingering shots of near-demonic patriarch faces, doe-like Joan receiving the officially approved Galgothan experience.You can see why the central performance is still regarded as one of the best. The saintly Joan's wretched pain & stark terror, broadcast loud as day over her elfin face is etched into our heads by the movie's end. She glows brighter the worse it gets,humiliatingly shorn of hair, abused and at last- martyred.The horror is foremost but also gut wrenching sadness,the torment of a lamb abandoned by her Shepard to a den of wolves in sheep's clothing. Especially in the scene between her and the sympathetic priest Artaud (the only other person here that commands a fraction of the same magnetism)does the utter brokenness of Joan and her hopeless situation hit deep.I can't think of many actresses who looked more ethereally beautiful over the course of a movie in direct proportion to how much awfulness is dredged on them.The whole experience is Maria Falconetti's agony & ecstasy; her sad,wasted, haunted face.",,Anonymous,History

One Of The Best,"Since it's all been said, I just wanted to check in with my comments on 'The Passion Of Joan Of Arc"". I saw it recently and I am glad I did so. For all movie lovers, this is a must-see. I will try hard to avoid clichés and corn, as many reviewers have already used the thoughts I wanted to put down - and I am a movie-lover not a movie critic.It is difficult to remain detached from Joan as portrayed by Ms. Falconetti. She gives an extremely sympathetic and powerful performance and draws you to her. You cannot watch her face without feeling as she does and this, combined with Carl Dreyer's direction creates the illusion of reality and the 'suspension of disbelief' is complete.I thought the use of close-ups was very effective, as much of the film is comprised of them, particularly the harshness of the faces of her tormentors contrasted with the softness of Joan's. I have seen one other of Dreyer's films, ""Days of Wrath"", and felt the same stark realism and authenticity as depicted here. His films are more than character studies, they are in a sense soul studies. ""The Passion Of Joan Of Arc"" is the depiction of a true-life tragedy brought back to cinematic life by superb filmmaking.",,Anonymous,History
Sagas of Suffering,"As Bernadette Soubirous' story proposed suffering as a kind of pre-requisite to spiritual salvation, so Jeanne d'Arc's saga suggests a similar prospect.Whatever transpired in that remote village of Lourdes, public response widely bought into the concept of struggle as a requirement of genuine grace.""La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc"" dramatizes what was historically one of period phenomena, that of stalwart spiritualists facing the flames rather than denounce their voices and visions.So effective have been the various painters, playwrights and filmmakers in fashioning artworks based on these tales, that people have been profoundly influenced into tragically fallacious thinking.Such concepts are best laid to rest, along with ancient relics and rituals. They are as tired and worn as medieval self-flagellation whips and shackles.It's a new day of enlightenment, where we don't have to seek out gurus, soothsayers, or miracle healers.  We also don't have to buy into past mythology, no matter how persuasively it may be presented.As for myself, Mr. Dreyer's opus is one I personally shy away from with its dubiously downbeat message in the same manner that I avoid Gustav Dore's disfunctional lithographs of Dante's ""Purgatorio.""",,Anonymous,History
"Artistic yes, but not a dramatic masterpiece","It is hard to judge the quality of a movie like this.  Any comparison to later films is doomed at the start because the techniques and features are so different.  I did not feel the acting was at all remarkable, but the total composition was quite moving.  I appreciated Dreyer's blend of cynicism, faith, hope, anger, and pity in the performances of the judges. He showed Joan's piety more in their changing reactions to her than in Falconetti's performance.  I could not imagine her leading troops in battle. The trial probably did take a lot of Joan's self-confidence away, but Falconetti's wide-eyed woebegone tentative Joan, doing her duty despite her fear, generated only pity and respect for her courage.  Who would follow a person like that?  Christ after his betrayal kept a commanding presence.  It was almost as if Dreyer looked at all the martyr sculptures, created a consummate victim for his film play, and forgot about the real person who caused the controversy in the first place.  Falconetti's Joan would fit in well with the Children's Crusade, but was no Deborah or Boudicca leading troops, or even the Joan who passed muster with the King's counselors before being sent off to battle.The ""Voices of Light"" soundtrack and the composition as a whole worked beautifully together on the DVD as a fascinating work of art.  The end result was like a Ken Burns special or a video catalog of images, giving a two-dimensional detailed look at a time and place.  Is it the best Joan ever? Perhaps it is more authentic than some, but it has a clear emotional bias that makes it no different than any other well-made agenda-driven film. I purchased it rather than seeing ""Messenger"" because of the almost universal praise for the older film from critics reviewing Besson's version. I am not sorry that I bought the film but would not recommend it except to those interested in the craft of filmmaking or attuned to medieval music.",,Anonymous,History
