A warning to the curious.,"In the future year of 2019, a group of four replicas arrive on Earth in search of their creator, Blade Runner Rick Deckard is persuaded into hunting them down.Love it or hate it, one thing that can't be questioned, is the amount of movies that this film inspired. Blade Runner was a ground breaking movie, one that was way ahead of its time.Blade Runner is up there with Dune for me as one of the greatest movies to come out of the 80's, I would definitely deem it as a classic, it's so watchable.The best element for me, the visuals, this is one the truly exquisite looking film, consider the era it was made in, and the lack of sophisticated special effects and tech, this is a triumph of creativity.I know pacing is an issue for some, and storytelling has changed with time, but the pace here is very deliberate, it develops and builds, it's there to give you a sense of unease. Don't expect action at every turn, that's not the purpose of the film.The music of Vangelis is terrific throughout, it adds to the film, and never imposes or tries to overtake.I always love seeing someone's vision of the future, and the future world is wonderfully imaginative and perfectly realised, though still wonderfully 1980's, so there's plenty of punk and glam, big hair, clear plastic jackets and eye shadow galore. One thing that was spot on, a greater coming together of cultures.A recent news article about AI made me think of this film, scientists are warning about the threat posed by AI development, after watching this film again, I can see where they're coming from.Harrison Ford is great, perfectly cast as Deckard, another of his iconic roles. Rutger Hauer also manages to captivate and terrify.This is a classic, quality movie.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Timeless,"What can be said about this film that hasn't already been covered in preceding decennia? Blade Runner (either version) stands the test of time as an epic story which transcends a disparity of genres, as well as the seminal ""dark"" sci-fi film which has been mimicked so frequently (to varying degrees of success) since its original release. The interplay of film noir, sci-fi, and what is one of the most philosophically symbolic and academically analyzed narratives of the modern era holds its ground on both visual and cerebral levels even in the face of today's CGI laden blockbusters. The new director's cut, contrary to many cinematic re-hashings, actually serves to clarify many of the more nebulous aspects of the plot and makes a great film even better, arguably allowing it to be modernized and polished for a new generation of viewers who are more picky and yet simultaneously less idealistic. All while sustaining the feeling and flavor of the original. Call it restorative work if you will. The tinny and meandering score by Vangelis is pure 1980s at its most brooding and fits the texture and mood of the film beautifully. Indeed, for many reasons, finding this film in someone's DVD collection makes a true statement about their discriminating and refined taste in movies, and equally their appreciation of film as an artistic medium. I would suggest picking up a reader by someone like Nietzsche, Foucualt, Descartes, Kierkegaard, or any of the great existentialist philosophers after viewing this film in order to appreciate the story & its concepts at a whole new level, regardless if you're watching it for either the 1st, or the 100th time. An enduring classic and an intrepid piece of film-making with rich & often haunting visuals designed to entertain and promote introspection amongst its viewers. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A Milestone Of Science Fiction And A Cyberpunk Masterpiece,"A feast for the eyes. Dark and uncompromising. With a haunting musical score by Vangelis that adds a hypnotic quality to those breathtaking megacity landscapes of future Los Angeles. Ridley Scott's adaptation of Philip K. Dick's post-apocalyptic bounty hunter story 'Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep' is a visionary work of art; it's a dystopian masterpiece and I'd personally call it as much a milestone of science fiction as Kubrick's '2001' (and be advised to watch the version known as the ""final cut"" if you want to catch 'Blade Runner' as it was intended by its director).It's hard to overstate how influential the film was; it invented the sci-fi subgenre now known as ""cyberpunk"", and it was also the first ""film noir"" in a sci-fi setting. And although it looks so distractingly gorgeous that even today there are people who still dismiss it as superficial and mere ""eye candy"", it is a philosphically deep film that ponders existential questions about the nature of being human. Its slow, brooding quality will perhaps leave some modern audiences who are used to a different pace and more action underwhelmed - but make no mistake: this is a groundbreaking masterwork of its genre and a timeles classic. 10 stars out of 10.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain...","Blade Runner describes a future in which, through genetics, artificial humans are manufactured and called ""replicants""; employees in dangerous jobs and slaves in the outer colonies of the Earth. Made by Tyrell Corporation under the motto ""more humans than humans"" -especially the ""Nexus-6"" models- not only resembles humans, they are far superior physically.The replicants were declared illegal on planet Earth after a bloody mutiny occurred on the planet Mars, where they worked as slaves. A special police force, Blade Runners, is in charge of identifying, tracking and killing - or ""withdrawing"", in terms of the police itself - the fugitive replicants found on Earth. With a group of replicants loose in Los Angeles, Rick Deckard, the best agent that has existed in regard to the recovery and removal of the replicas, is removed from his semi-retirement to use some of ""the old magic blade runner"".Ridley Scott fantastic dark cyberpunk style and futuristic design is so well made that accomplished to create a visual vocabulary: neon lights, abandonment, decay, loneliness, obscurity, indifference and alienation are the core of the aesthetics of the film, which will eventually become and serve as a pattern for successive cinematographic works.The script David Webb Peoples adapted from 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' takes the viewer into a dwelling and philosophical controversy, as it creates doubt and empathy to the so called replicants, primarily as seen in many shots of Rick Deckard hesitating about the true nature of his task.Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer haunts the attention into the essence of the story. Their characterization throughout infiltrates the different conceptions of life. A saddened soul searching for the meaning of his punished existence and the other, ruminating a task sinking him into a moral void brimming with guilt.At the end, the movie leaves you wondering about the implications the creation of highly intelligent beings (IA) must have and, if it's worth treating them as machines or they have become so human that the difference is non existent.""Time... to die"".10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Classic mix of sci-fi and noir,"Rick Deckard is given an assignment to 'retire' several biologically engineered fugitives.The plot follows Deckard as he hunts replicants, falls in love and questions his own humanity. It moves slow, allowing you to take in all the sights and sounds of 2019 Los Angeles (as imagined in 1982), whilst pondering some of its themes.The imagery and dialogue associated with what defines a sentient being and what makes us human is compellingly portrayed. The device used to explore these themes is the genetically engineered humanoid life-form, the godlike status of its creator and the morally compromised nature of the ordinary human. Additionally the number of references to the eyes and linking of what we see and remember versus what is fake and reality, is cleverly mixed into the story. If you want in depth analysis, google 'Blade Runner Themes and Motifs'.The character of Roy Batty has been interpreted as both a religious and philosophical allegory, but these theories are debatable. He is for me the most intriguing character in the movie and his final scene is one of the most memorable of all time. Along with Deckard, it made me wonder if there is any real difference between humans and replicants. He is portrayed wonderfully by Rutger Hauer who both looks and acts the part.Deckard is impressively played by Harrison Ford, who is perfect for movies with an emphasis on visuals. Ninety percent of his power as an actor comes from his screen presence and soulful facial expressions. His scenes with Sean Young young are as touching as the action scenes are brutal.One of Blade Runner's most memorable aspects is its depiction of 2019 Los Angeles, with its permanently dark rainy skies, overcrowding, neon lights, high concept technology, urban decay and environmental devastation. Take away the flying cars and off-world colonies and it's not far off an accurate prediction.I could write about the atmospheric cinematography, artistic designs and special effects, but nothing I can say would do it justice.The question of whether Deckard is replicant or human is interesting. There is evidence of both but you must watch and decide. Does it matter? Probably not. If I had to decide, I'd say replicant.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"A glorious, timeless nightmare","Dark, deep, uncertain, unsettling  imagine the most beautiful nightmare you've ever had  this is Blade Runner (1982).Ridley Scott's Blade Runner is a brilliantly crafted science fiction film that not only touches upon, but bravely plunges into deep philosophical questions, making it simply ten times more important than any film of its genre. I love it not only for the initial feeling it gives, but because of its perseverance  none of the visuals, themes or technology feel dated but as deep, gripping and current as ever. It is timeless beauty with huge doses of emotion.Set in 2019 Los Angeles, Blade Runner zooms in on the eerily-lit, urban streets of the city and follows Richard Deckard  superbly played by Harrison Ford who brings an exquisite moral ambiguity to his character  a special policeman who tracks down and terminates artificially-created humans called replicants, who have escaped from an Off-World colony and made their way to earth and need to be stopped. The things Deckard encounters on his detective journey raise many philosophical questions like: Who is really a replicant? Are replicants really bad? If replicants are bad, when why did we go to such lengths with our technology to create them? Are replicants really humans? Is Deckard a hero? This truly is a film that demands subsequent discussion and its ambiguous ending leave a haunting and eerie feeling.In spite of a rich glaze of science fiction and futurism coating this adventure, there are distinct film noir elements present  primarily in the bluish haze that the film is seen through and its gritty urban atmosphere. Whoever thought of this combination is a genius. Since it is all about technology, it fits then that Blade Runner features a ridiculous amount of product placement, especially from Atari. In any other film, this would have felt out-of-place but here it is simply perfect. The score by Vangelis is strangely gripping when combined with the striking cinematography of the film.Blade Runner deserves credit, celebration and remembrance for it is simply an excellent film.10 out of 10 (and I don't just throw this grade out like SOME people)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"A compelling, thematically-deep SF film","This is truly one of the greatest science fiction films ever made, one that requires a thinking viewer in order to understand and appreciate it.  The director's cut is the recommended one to see as it omits a somewhat distracting narration and avoids an unnecessary Hollywood-style ending that is at odds with the rest of the film's tone.A true science fiction story or film is about ideas, not spaceship battles, futuristic gadgets, or weird creatures.  ""Blade Runner"" fully qualifies as this in its examination of the impact of technology on human society, existence, and the very nature of humanity itself.  These themes are set in a fairly basic detective story that moves slowly but gradually builds power as the viewer is immersed in a dystopian futuristic Los Angeles.Harrison Ford fans accustomed to the normally dynamic roles that he plays may be dissatisfied with the seemingly lifeless lead character that he portrays here as the replicant-hunting detective known as a ""blade runner"". They should be, for this dissatisfaction is part of the film experience, part of the dehumanized existence in the story's setting.  However, as the story unfolds, we see Ford's character, Rick Deckard, slowly come alive again and recover some humanity while pursing four escaped replicants.The replicants, genetically-engineered human cyborgs, that Deckard must hunt down and kill are in many ways more alive than Deckard himself initially. Their escape from an off-world colony has an explicit self-directed purpose, whereas Deckard's life appears to have none other than his job, one that he has tried to give up.  By some standards, Deckard and the replicants have thin character development.  However, this is a deeply thematic and philosophical film, and as such the characters are the tools of the story's themes.  Each character reflects some aspect of humanity or human existence, but they lack others, for each is broken in ways that reflect the broken society in which they live and were conceived/created.There are several dramatic moments involving life-and-death struggles, but most of these are more subdued than in a normal detective story plot.  The film's power is chiefly derived through its stunning visual imagery of a dark futuristic cityscape and its philosophical themes.Among the themes explored are the following: - The dehumanization of people through a society shaped by technological and capitalistic excess. - The roles of creator and creation, their mutual enslavement, and their role reversal, i.e., the creation's triumph over its creator. - The nature of humanity itself: emotions, memory, purpose, desire, cruelty, technological mastery of environment and universe, mortality, death, and more. - Personal identity and self-awareness. - The meaning of existence.If you are not someone who naturally enjoys contemplating such themes, the film's brilliance may be lost on you.  The climax involves a soliloquy that brings many of the themes together in a simple yet wonderfully poetic way. Anyone who ""gets"" the film should be moved by this; others will sadly miss the point and may prefer watching some mindless action flick instead.""Blade Runner"" is a masterpiece that deserves recognition and long remembrance in film history.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Overrated IMHO,"I know it is blasphemy to many, but I didn't love this movie. Somewhat groundbreaking in its use of actual darkness to impart the bleak tone. I'm a fan of Harrison Ford and Ridley Scott. The supporting cast is solid. It's just a bit boring at times.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"All style, no plot","First of all, I REALLY want to like this movie since I love sci-fi movies. I first saw it in december last year and the movie left me very disappointed. I just rewatched it, hoping that I missed something the first time I watched it, but it didnt get any better on rewatch. I'll start with a positive note ; Everything in this film looks absolutely fantastic. For design and production it gets a 10/10. But asside from that, the movie gives me pretty much nothing else to enjoy. The plot was uninteresting and the pacing was too slow. Besides Rutger Hauers character, all the other characters in this movie were among the most boring and monotone I have ever seen, which makes me not care about any of them. All that happened in the movie was basically just Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer going from place to place to interrogate people and kill them. I still rate it 6/10 because the design kept me sort of entertained and the final battle was ok I guess. It may sound very controversial but Blade Runner 2049 is a much better movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Am I missing something?,"I made an Imdb account just to leave this review. I was so excited to watch what I've heard many refer to as ""the greatest sci-fi film ever made"". The only thing keeping this from a 1/10 is the visuals. The atmosphere is great, dystopian Los Angeles reminds me of a vivid terrifying nightmare-scape. Besides that, this is one of the most flat and empty movies I've ever seen. The pacing is never more than a crawl, we are given no reason to care about the characters, and it has the worst quality a film can have: it bored me to tears. A statement could be made that it is not great for its entertainment value, but more so for its philosophical commentary on the future of machines and AI, but the film did an awful job at that as well! I haven't the slightest idea what I'm supposed to have taken from this film.
If one enjoys this for the nostalgia factor, go ahead, but if you're new to sci-fi, do not watch thisToo Long Didn't Read: Great visuals, dull and uninteresting script and characters will bore you to tears.

A frame to die for.,"I spent a weekend with the new DVD set of Blade Runner. Watched all four versions pretty much back to back (minus the work print version) starting with the US theatrical and finishing with the Final Cut. And across those eight hours I spent with the film, I did not get tired of watching – just watching – that futuristic film-noir vibe: deep dark shadows and majestic use of light and color used to make a run-down polluted cityscape look so beautiful. In fact, when I got to the Final Cut, which had been cleaned up, restored, and remixed, the picture and sound quite literally took my breath away.Blade Runner is easily one of the best looking films ever made.In some ways, many ways, Blade Runner strikes me as silly. Particularly in its more climactic moments where the protagonist faces off against a replicant. Pris's acrobatic means of attacking Deckard? When Roy Batty chases Deckard in his shorts (when a few moments before he was fully clothed?) The film goes over-the-top to the point where I find myself asking, ""why in the world would the characters do that?!"" But here's what's interesting: as silly as Blade Runner may get it never betrays its own world. Everything that happens, in some queer way, feels natural to this strange futuristic world.I like the movie in its action scenes, but I simply adore it during the quieter moments – the parts where not a whole hell of a lot is happening, and you can simply watch and absorb Jordan Cronenweth's marvelous cinematography. My favorite scene comes when Rachel has saved Deckard's life. An emotional wreck of killing another replicant on top of the revelation that she, herself, is a replicant – she stands by a window where light floods in, so much light that the whole screen goes white, and then it recedes again and we see the characters again. Later in that same scene, she sits at the piano, plays for a bit, and then lets her hair down. Hearing Deckard stumbling in the other room, she looks out of the corner of her eye  and shot after shot after shot through this entire sequence demonstrates absolute mastery over the frame.Plus some of the other quiet moments resonate with a truer low-key science-fiction feel such as the scene in Tyrell corporation where Deckard applies the Voight-Kampff test to Rachel. More or less a mundane questionaire/interview with a typical sci-fi gadget sitting on the table, but Ridley Scott and Terry Rawlings compacts the lengthy endeavor into a few short moments using a stunningly simple montage.Later on, Deckard sits in front of a voice-activated screen analyzing a photograph. The task is presented as a dull monotonous job (made especially evident in Harrison Ford's delivery), yet the scene, itself, never bores. The voice-activation not only serves as a staple sci-fi device, but cleverly allows Deckard to take the audience's hand and guide them through this investigative process. And perhaps what I like most about the scene: the audience, and even Deckard himself, doesn't even really know what he's found. Things don't magically fall into place with a Scooby-Doo moment of revelation. He finds another clue that might lead somewhere (albeit, since it's a movie it's a good guess the clue does lead somewhere.) In my mind at least moments such as the Voight-Kampff scenes, Deckard's briefing, the photograph analysis, both of Rachel's scenes in Deckard's apartment gives the world of Blade Runner a solid grounding so later on it can get away with the absurd.Which brings me to the replicants. Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) in particular, whose strangely sympathetic in that his murderous tendencies spawn directly from his fear of dying. This is a man who possesses a strong conviction that he deserves life perhaps because he looks around on earth and sees people squandering their existence while he knows he only has a few short moments. Why should a shmuck like Deckard live for 50+ years when Roy in his 4 short years has seen attack ships burning off the shoulder of Orion and seen C-beams glitter in the dark  ""If only you could see what I've seen with your eyes,"" he proudly and warmly tells one of the scientists who helped create him.As for which cut of the film, I don't think any single one is perfect (and I'd honestly watch any of them in a heartbeat.) I prefer the ""Final Cut"" over the others and admire Ridley Scott's restraint in his definitive DVD release. Most of the modifications are fine-tuning tweaks the casual viewer won't even notice unless watching two version back to back, and most of said fine-tuning improve the film (although, admittingly, Roy's beckoning of Sebastian could've been left out.) But hell, all versions of Blade Runner are included, so people don't have much room to complain about the changes. And no matter what version you go with, it's still a beautiful film to just  watch.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The Last Great Noir,"This is a film that is so deep, rich, and multi-layered, it may require more than one viewing to fully absorb the brilliance of what you've just seen. At first glance, it can be a bit slow. It's told in a classic film noir fashion, so this is to be expected. Director Ridley Scott seems to want to savor every shot, and an astute audience will be able to sense this.Now, I say the film is told in a classic Noir style, but this can be misleading. There is no Humphrey Bogart in Blade Runner, snapping off brilliant one-liners once a second. Only hopeless people, in many ways victims of the merciless world of which they are all a part. Deckard is a typically downbeat protagonist, a hard-boiled cynical leading man with a weakness for heavy drinking. The plot is a mystery in name only, as the audience is allowed to know what Roy Batty, Pris and Leon are all up to before Deckard ever finds out. This only lends to the dread and inevitability of the film, lending further to its pervasive gloom. There is no final scene at the end where the bold detective puts all the pieces together and says ""Ah-Ha!"". Instead, we find Rick Deckard questioning his own existence and drinking away his constant doubts, all the while embroiled in a romantic relationship with someone he's sworn to kill.Blade Runner requires audience participation, particularly in the Director's Cut, which is entirely devoid of some rather necessary exposition provided by the Original Cut's much-maligned voice-over. Certain facts will not be clear even at the end of the film, requiring personal interpretation in order to be appreciated fully. Other facts will be given away in much more subtle ways than in most modern cinema, such as through visual cues and tenuous dialogue.Finally, visually, this movie is quite simply a science fiction triumph. It looks better than modern computer effects in every way that counts. Superimposed special effect objects don't give off that unnatural, clearly computer-generated ""Lord of the Rings"" sheen common in today's effects-driven blockbusters. This, of course, is because Blade Runner - while a gorgeous movie - is not effects driven in the least. Rather, it is a visually driven story that doesn't rely on special effects. This is an important distinction to make in today's Hollywood.""Touch of Evil"" really wasn't the last of the Great Film Noirs!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
One of the greatest Sci-Fi movies of all time.,"Blade Runner is perhaps the best sci-fi film and undoubtedly one of the best films of all time. Along with 2001: A Space Odyssey, it is one of the most philosophical and influential movies ever created, as it conveys a plethora of fundamental questions, which are woven in the very fabric of the human essence and existence. It seems near impossible to imagine a more suitable fusion of two of the most successful genres of all time, Science Fiction and Film Noir. By merging together the moral conflict and the emphatic character arc of the private detective, a trait that is exclusive to and definitive of the Film Noir genre, with a futuristic dystopian environment, Blade Runner creates the ultimate Neo-Noir setting, the only one capable of supporting such strong ideas and posing such significant questions to the viewer, without compromising on an interesting plot development and an appealing pace, things that are masterfully achieved via a tight script and persuasive performances.In a dark, future dystopian portrait of a 2019 Los Angeles, where humans have alienated themselves with their true nature and claimed the title of god/creator of life, effectively manufacturing artificial intelligence and bioengineering androids, called ""Replicants"", a retired ""Blade Runner"" named Rick Deckard is assigned with the undertaking of terminating four rogue such replicants that have illegally returned to Earth in a quest to force their maker, Tyrel, into postponing their grim destiny, basically prolonging their already predetermined four-year lifespan. Their greatest sin, however, is having the audacity of desiring one of the most sought-after values in the history of the human species, the freedom to live as they please. In this uneasy and twisted world, the lines between humanness and machinery are blurred and Deckard is faced with the consequences of the realization that not all is as it seems and there is more to ""being-alive"" than most believe.Blade Runner's unique depiction of the future has been imitated numerous times quite unsuccessfully, mostly due to the fact that no other film to this date has managed to create such an engaging atmosphere so beautifully connected to every part of it, effectively enhancing every scene and allowing for a strong conveyance of all the moral and existential questions that are posed during the whole duration. The audience is instantaneously absorbed by the vivid and compelling world depicted in the film, and that's where Ridley Scott succeeds the most, offering a glance into an original and somewhat disturbing reality that might very well be humanity's near future. The cinematography is impeccable, the art direction is gorgeous and along with some of the best visual effects that have ever been used in film-making, creates one of the most realistic and visually stunning environments that have ever graced a motion picture to this day. Vangelis has also composed one of the best and most awe-inspiring scores of all time, effectively managing to capture the very essence of each scene, thus making all sound a significant and inseparable part of the whole cinematic experience that Blade Runner has to offer.This thorough examination of what it means to be human isn't, thankfully, to no avail, as a careful observant, is forced to question their beliefs and attempt to choose a side on dilemmas that are still discussed by philosophers to this day, such as the traits that define humanity, the relativity that characterizes concepts like right or wrong, good or evil, as well as the meaning of life itself. The moral and existential complexity of this reality that Blade Runner has offered to the world reaches depths unparalleled by the majority of the films available, therefore greatly distinguishing it from all others and thus emphasizing its uniqueness through the most complete portrayal of science fiction to date.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Science Fiction Epic,"I have an interest in science fiction films and TV programmes. I like shows like (the original) Star Wars trilogy, (most of) the Star Trek films, as well as Star Trek TV series (Voyager for modern times,preferably, as it had the least number of useless episodes), etc. In my experience, most SF material turns out to be distilled garbage. Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' was a masterpiece. I am not hesitant to say that I blatantly dislike Spielberg's definition of SF- ET, Close Encounters, & (worst of all) War Of The Worlds. Neither do I appreciate any 'Alien' film apart from R Scott's 1979 original (although Alien2 was OK)-Alien vs Pred is a disgrace not only to all genres, but to the film industry itself. So when I heard of Blade Runner on the net, I wondered; what could be so good about this film? I have HBO,Cinemax, Star Movies- yet this film has never been shown. So, I got myself the Director's Cut at the local video store. I watched it once. Then I re-watched it two days later. My verdict: This film is fantastic.It is one of the greatest films ever made, on par with 2001: A Space Odyssey. Upon 1st viewing, new audiences may be bewildered. One anticipates a futuristic run-of-the-mill 80's shoot-em-up (in the like of Outland,say). What you get is a film so deep that it is difficult to grasp the 1st time. There is so much symbolism, introverts and questions that I was left stunned. The film is hauntingly beautiful, and I doubt that these screen landscapes could be reproduced today as well as they were here. The plot centres around the question of humanity- something we take for granted. It is not an auctioneer, which was probably what audiences expected when they walked into theatres in the 80s, causing the film to fail commercially. Blade Runner is not for the adrenaline junkie, nor for those who like flashy gadgets and bright explosions, with a healthy Hollywood-made dose of convincing storyline spoon-fed for their satisfaction.The film is set in the apocalyptic, suggestively post-war future Earth, where there seems to be a lag in technology. Perhaps there was a war which ravaged the world, forcing humans to migrate (the cramped cultural richness of LA), and rebuild, explaining the retro technology. 6 'Criminal' Nexus 6 replicates (genetically engineered humanoids), hijack a ship and come to Earth seeking their maker. These slaves(machines/automatons// regard them as anything which has been created by Man to lessen his burden) have developed emotions, and they fear death for they cherish their memories (Think robots weeping over photographs). Their cause: They want a longer life, they want to experience more, they want to be... human.Enter Rick Deckard, Blade Runner. His job: kill trespassing replicates; Kill living, breathing humanoids composed of flesh and blood who only have 4 years to live out their miserable lives, seeking haven on Earth rather than serving as slaves in mining outposts on Mars. Kill? Murder seems more appropriate. But that's his job. replicates which trespass are a hazard. These 6 replicates have killed 23 people and hijacked a ship. They have to be killed, right? If you're planning to take sides in this film, you will be pleasantly if not unnervingly surprised. There are no sides. There is no good and evil. Harrison Ford plays the reluctant, burned out Blade Runner very well. His character is drab and dull, as it was meant to be; look at him in the Spinner on the way to Tyrell corporation- pure boredom. He hates his job. If there were any narration, it Should sound dull and uninteresting, reflecting his character. Rutger Hauer gives the greatest performance of his career (so far) in this film, playing Roy Batty, Replicant 'project manager'. He dominates the later part of the film. He is cold, stiff and evil, but in the end speech, one of the Greatest endings I have ever seen, his performance alone makes this film a Classic. The ending is beautiful, and the score by Vangelis is perfect.All in all, the film is excellent. Well directed by Ridley Scott, innovative and stunning imagery underlined by Vangelis' superb score, and plenty to think about (on your own- no spoon feeding). Check out the trivia for this film; scientists voted it better than 2001:A Space Odyssey. Is the quest for humanity a crime? Find out for yourself. Blade Runner is a Must-Watch, and a Must-Have film.My rating: 8.9 / 10 Thank you for your time. Kris",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
One of Ridley Scott's best,"Blade Runner is quite simply wonderful, and not only is it one of Ridley Scott's best films, but also one of the best of the genre. For one thing, the visuals are superb. Not just in the special effects which are just mind-blowing but also in the cinematography, colours and sets. Another strong asset is the score, in fact Blade Runner is easily one of Vangelis's best by how mysterious and haunting it all is.The story is just great. True, it is the sort of film you need to see more than once to understand/appreciate it, but that is not a flaw in any way, quite the contrary. The story is very compelling, and also very deep thematically. Blade Runner is further advantaged by memorable dialogue, superb direction by Scott and good pacing. I can understand why some are underwhelmed by the ending, I was at first, but the more I saw the film the more the ending made sense to me. Finally the performances. Harrison Ford is perfectly cast, and Sean Young supports him admirably, but the real star of the cast is Rutgar Hauer who is outstanding in his role.In conclusion, a brilliant film and something Scott should be proud of. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
New Blu-Ray Disc Made Me A Blade Runner Fan,"Sometimes you just need to give a film a second chance, even if it is 20 years later! Only some rave reviews about the picture quality of this new 5-disc ""Complete Collector's Edition"" enticed me to watch this again. Wow, I am glad; this was a very entertaining and a tremendous visual and audio treat.I actually appreciated the audio best because, even in this new Blu-Ray era, one doesn't often find a film with very active surround speakers. However, this ""restored"" version did and the sound is, at the point, the best I've heard on a Blu-Ray disc....or any DVD, for that matter. The visuals? Well, fans of Blade Runner know all about them. They are fantastic. Scene-after-scene reminded me of a Stanley Kubrick film or another bizarre 1980s movie called ""Jacob's Ladder.""Because there are so many things to see and hear, and the story is different, one filled with strange characters, I can see where people would watch this film multiple times and enjoy it very much each time. The ""Collector's Edition"" has the best picture ever, according to director Ridley Scott, and ""is the version I'm most pleased with."" It has added scenes one didn't see in earlier versions. The rest of the DVD has those earlier versions. Apparently, there are several including those with Harrison Ford doing narration, like out of a late '40s film noir.Speaking of the latter, that's what this film looked like: a combination film noir (or neo-noir) and sci-fi movie. It has many dark images, fantastic night-time scenes, wonderful closeups and an always-interesting color palette. Sci-fi films usually get dated in a hurry, thanks to ever-increasing special-effects progress in the movie industry, but this still looks very good. Despite being made over 25 years ago, Blade Runner still looks very much state-of-the-art.Scott says this is the best version and the best his film has ever looked and sounded. Since it's his movie, who am I to argue. So, if you're like me and never gave this movie a chance (I lost interest halfway through with my VHS look at it), give this a second look on this Blu-Ray edition....and you will be blown away. This is, indeed, an amazing film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
More Blade Walker than Blade Runner,"This movie is undoubtedly a timeless classic, visually appealing with dark twists and turns that make for some great atmospherics. But the plot does seem to take a backseat at times to the, at the time, superb special effects. The very human thoughts and feelings of the ""replicants"" makes for some emotional viewing, crowned by the ""tears in rain"" monologue by Rutger Hauer. What really lets the movie down is the pace. The story crawls along so slowly that at times makes you think ""I've got to finish watching, it's a classic movie"", rather than wanting to watch based on its own merits.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Intriguingly Philosophical,"Blade Runner, directed by Ridley Scott and based on Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, is a Sci-fi slash Noir film about a cop named Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) in a decrepit 2019 Los Angeles whose job it is to ""retire"" four genetically engineered syborgues, known as ""Replicants"".  The four fugitives, Pris (Daryl Hannah), Zhora (Joanna Cassidy), Leon (Brion James), and their leader, Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), have escaped from an off-world colony in order to find their creator and bully him into expanding their pre-determined four year life span.  This film originally flopped when it came out in 1982, but since has become a widely acclaimed cult classic with a director's cut to boot.  A large part of the success that this movie has received can be attributed to its ability to operate on many different levels.Ridley Scott's hauntingly possible depiction of what might become of Los Angeles down the line is absolutely brilliant.  It captures elements of Noir with its urban atmosphere of decadence, lighting, and characters neither clearly defined as good nor evil.  Corruption is everywhere.  The garbage-littered streets and permanence of dark and rain give us the sense that we've seriously screwed up the atmosphere, and the impression that all respectable human beings have fled to the off-world colonies, leaving only the scum of the earth behind.There is a hint of style from the 40's, especially with respect to cars, costumes, and music.  Rachael's entire outfit, including her hair, screams the 40's.The soundtrack, arranged by Vangelis (who won an Oscar for his Chariots of Fire score), consisted mainly of Jazz and Blues.  This functioned to represent a dark, moody world of uncertainty and pessimism.The special effects were exceptional.  Much of the set was pulled off using models.  In my opinion, sets made by hand require leagues more of skill and are much more impressive and realistic than those computer generated.  These guys really knew what they were doing.  I was especially fond of the pyramidesque Tyrell Corporation building, which hinted at the god-like presence of Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkell), the creator.The script (Hampton Fancher, David Peoples, and of course Phil Dick) worked for me, as well as the actors who gave voice to it.  Harrison Ford was well...Harrison Ford.  I thought he did a tremendous job down-playing the role.  His voice-over narration helped you along, and was yet another feature conducive to Film Noir (apparently this was taken out of the Director's Cut).  Rutger Hauer's performance was intense.  His lines at the end were intriguingly philosophical.  Daryl Hannah's chilling robotic expressions were quite impressive.  Joanna Cassidy was just plain hot.There is more to this film than just pulp.  It works on so many remarkable levels.  The movie itself is a detective noir quest for the meaning of life in a science fiction environment, but the story is a commentary on what it means to be human and the questions each one of us have about life, like: How long have I to live?  Why do I have to die?  What happens when I die? Doesn't my maker care?  Is this all merely an illusion?  At the end of the film we are left to wonder if these Replicants are human, and if Deckard himself is in fact a Replicant.  Scott raises more questions here than he answers, and as a result, critics are still debating the mysteries of this film today.  In a sense, the ambiguity of Blade Runner is the culprit of its success.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"The ultimate sci fi flick, well ahead of its time","Perhaps the best sci fi movie ever made, this cult classic was underappreciated at its time.

I Finally Get It,"I had seen the Director's Cut (a misleading title) of Blade Runner and was slightly underwhelmed. I mean, sure it looked great, but the supposedly deep story just didn't grab me. Then I got the five disc briefcase for Christmas and immediately put in the Final Cut. Wow. It's all clear now.Blade Runner is one of a precious few pantheon of science fiction film that has become even more prescient as time passes (the other that comes to mind is 2001: A Space Odyssey). Look at the L.A. in this film, then look at present-day Los Angeles. Subtract the flying cars and robots and you've got the same city (horribly polluted and overpopulated with many ethnicities mixing language and cultures). We follow Deckard, a specialized cop known as a Blade Runner who hunts down androids known as replicants. These machines look like humans and, if given time to mature, emote like humans. They are used as labor and sex slaves, but die out after a 4 year period so their emotions do not develop (this too has ties to the modern world. Planned obsolescence is the reason your electronics never last more than a year or two). When a replicant starts to piece things together before it dies, Deckard must take it out before it harms humans.As the film progresses, we can see that Deckard doesn't particularly like his job despite the fact that he is the best Blade Runner in town. The replicant Rachael (played by Sean Young) seems to trigger a re-evaluation of his life, and he takes no pleasure in hunting the group of dangerous androids he's been hired to ""retire"".This film is Sir Ridley Scott's masterpiece, and the one that best shows his talents. Like his idol Kubrick, Scott knows how to light a scene just the right way, and his use of smoke and blinds and fans and anything else that distorts light is what gives the film its noir feel. He drops clues all along the way to that paramount of questions: Is Deckard a replicant? Every clue can be construed to fit either side of the debate, and it proves that there is no wrong answer to the question.The Final Cut essentially omits and touches up more than it adds. Most ""director's cuts"" are excuses to throw in material that was cut for a reason (and a good deal of them are done without the director's consent). Here, Scott digitally touches up a few technical flaws, but he doesn't go crazy like Lucas. Also, we get the complete unicorn scene, which is crucial to the film's big question, as well as sticking with the DC's omitted voice-over narration (which is such a blessing, by the way).In the end Blade Runner is a masterful look at that which makes us human. Roy Batty's final act gives us all the insight into replicants we need and his final speech is perhaps the single most moving moment in science fiction. It serves to underscore the whole film, and it sends chills down my spine every time I see it. Blade Runner is one of those precious sci-fi films that actually challenges you to think, and it almost single-handedly founded the film genre of cyberpunk, which had been present in literature but hadn't crossed over. Cyberpunk is unquestionably the most thought-provoking sub-genre of science fiction, and this film is its masterpiece. Many people award a film they like a perfect 10, but this is truly a cornerstone that has influenced directors, actors, and entire genres of film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"""Los Angeles, November, 2019"" - an unforgettable movie theater experience","I saw ""Blade Runner"" in the theater again today (more on that later). First time I saw this film, it was the original version when it came out in Belgium (where I grew up) in 1982. Decades later, I saw it again, this time on DVD and in the ""Director's Cut"" or ""Final Cut"", I can't quite remember. The version I saw today was definitely the Final Cut.""Blade Runner"" (originally released in 1982; The FInal Cut released in 2007; 117 min.) brings the story of Deckard, as he tracks down 4 replicants who have escaped from an Off World and need to be ""retired"" with extreme prejudice. As the movie opens, we are reminded it is ""Los Angeles, November, 2019"". YES, this very year! In Ridley Scott's (bleak and dark) vision of the future, LA is in permanent darkness and rain, with lots of pollution, and lots of overcrowding. Our man Deckard (Harrison Ford) meets Rachel (Sean Young), who may or may not be a replicant, who can tell for sure? In the meantime Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) is the leader of the replicants and up to no good...While watching this in the theater today, I was struck by several things: first, the enormous vision from Ridley Scott this movie asked for (and received). Second, the set design and production is out of this world STILL, now almost 40 years later. Third, while there is very little ""action"", this movie flew by in no time (same as its Blade Runner 2049 sequel, incidentally). A movie like ""Blade Runner"" begs to be seen on the big screen. As luck would have, my art-house theater here in Cincinnati is doing a month-long sci-fi classics festival during July, and this was the first (and certainly not the last) that I was eager to see again in the theater. The July 4 matinee screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely, and I imagine the later screenings will be PACKED.

Miraculous masterpiece: great,"Several years ago I may have read the original story, but don't remember it; and it doesn't matter. The same bleakly powerful message probably pervades both book and picture. The fact is, we are all replicants. The bitter truth is, we have no purpose, except to reproduce ourselves. Whether our life-span last 4, 40 or 140 years, it is as purposeless and pointless as if we were androids. Which we are. It doesn't matter what we have seen or experienced. We will pass and be forgotten, like the rest. It has been noticed that this film contains no families, or children. The need for that traditional, outdated method of self-replication has been eliminated, and people are simply duplicated, in different models, with variations. Memories are routinely fed into replicants, to convince them that they have reality, however spurious. If there ever was a creator, he was definitely killed, for his presumption. There is no doubt that, like everyone else, Deckard is a replicant. The film is frighteningly and permanently effective, for anyone who thinks about it, in every way. It's an image of our actual lives, here and now.Everything about Blade Runner is absolutely fabulous. It soars where the clunky and semi-literate Kubrick stumbles and fumbles.Now that I've read the book, and watched ""Dangerous Days"", I learn that Tyrell, the supposed creator, was merely another replicant, which simply confirms what I already believed.The performances are nonpareil. The girl playing Rachael (funny spelling) is perfection itself. But all the players are flawless, anyway. The vision is transcendental, matchless. A magnificent meditation on the reality of death, and life's ultimate lack of meaning.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Not as good as I thought it would be..,"I love Science Fiction..
And I thought it felt right to watch this before watching the recent 2017 remake.. This one is directed by the awesome Ridley Scott.. I had high expectations.. And ofcourse judging from my extensive experience within this genre, older Sci-fi are much, much better than the recent ones, mainly because they have a *philosophically sound foundation* and *interesting storyline*, I do NOT put too much concern for the CGI and other superficial aspects as an ordinary person does while watching this genre..
Anyway, remember when I mentioned ""older Sci-fi are much better than recent ones"" therein comes my mistake, I haven't known the exact time frame from which Sci-fi movies have become good..Now I know it started from around the early 90s..
The major problem I have with this movie is that over 90% of the happenings in this film, weren't sci-fi aspects at all, it was boring old investigative or detective work.. If you liked The Departed and found it sooo _THRILLING_, _EXCITING_ and _SUSPENSEFUL_, then by all means you should watch Blade Runner 1982 Final Cut. I don't care how highly rated a movie is, if it's boring;- for example, using cookie cutter- / run of the mill- concepts or events, the same used for/in countless other movies, I will never watch it.. These scenes are stuffing scenes they ad no real value to the viewing experience, here, they are too much.. And if I did watch a boring movie with high ratings such as this one, I would certainly give it a failing review.. But since it was only 1982,
I guess people were bland back then and they liked bland things, therefore a 6/10 is fair..
This movie was mostly dull and not as genuine as I thought it would be.. If you like Harrison Ford, watch The Fugitive instead.. Another (even older) movie that is overrated yet suffers from dull and boring syndrome is 2001 A Space Odyssey, two thirds into that movie, I shut it off and never to return again.. lol.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Living in Fear in a Quest for Life,"In the beginning of the Twentieth-First Century, the Tyrell Corporation releases the evolution of robots in the Nexus phase with Replicants that are identical to humans, but with superior strength and agility and the intelligence of the genetic engineers who created them. They are used off-world as slave labor in the colonization of other planets. After a bloody mutiny in a colony, the Replicants are declared illegal on Earth and hunted down by the Blade Runner units, special police squads that shoot them to kill. The execution of a Replicant is called retirement.In November 2019, in Los Angeles, the retired Blade Runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is summoned by his former chief Bryant (M. Emmet Walsh) that assigns him to hunt down four Replicants that are hidden in Los Angeles. Deckard studies the profiles of Roy (Rutger Hauer), Pris (Daryl Hannah), Leon Kowalski (Brion James) and Zhora (Joanna Cassidy) and finds that they had been designed with four years lifespan maximum and they tried to infiltrate themselves in the Tyrell Corporation. Deckard visits their creator, Dr. Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkel), in his corporation. Sr. Tyrell asks Deckard to demonstrate his Voigt Kampff method to discover the Replicants in his assistant Rachael (Sean Young) and Deckard concludes that she is a sophisticated Replicant but she does not know. When Deckard ""retires"" Zhora and Leon, he feels affected by their deaths and by the question of Rachel whether he has tested himself to know whether he is a Replicant. But he needs to end his mission and find Roy and Pris.""Blade Runner"" is a melancholic work of art that raises existential questions about fear, life, death, emotions, mortality, humanity, dehumanization and love among other philosophical questions in an environment totally destroyed by excessive pollution, technology, marketing and consumption. The wrecked Earth is left to police and little people only, the others inhabitants have moved to the colonies in the off-world. The conflict appears when the retired Blade Runner Deckard is forced to hunt down Replicants again but now with different feelings, after falling in love for the Replicant Rachel and in doubt whether he is also a Replicant. Sean Young certainly has the best role of her career. The bleak cinematography and special effects are awesome and the soundtrack of Vangelis is among the most beautiful of the cinema history. I can not precisely say how many times I have watched the different versions of this film that is among my five favorite movies in the movie-theater, on VHS, on DVD and now on Blu-Ray, but my guess is at least twelve times. The last times I had seen this film were on 06 May 2000 and 31 May 2003. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Blade Runner""",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Style over substance, yet still impressive","Blade Runner has become a cult hit in the 19 years since its release.  It is understandable why.  The film has a disjointed, postmodern narrative surrounded by superb photography and set design.  The hero is not even a hero and the conclusion of the film, at least the director's cut, isn't all that happy.  Most of all, Blade Runner eerily shadows the near future for our own world, the future of cloning and unnaturally created humans. Science fiction has always been able to show us images of ourselves or our world in a future or alien world, things we would prefer not to see.Blade Runner's premise is simple.  Deckard (Harrison Ford) has to hunt down four Replicants': artificial humans who have great intelligence but superior physical attributes.  These replicants have run amock in space colonies and now human authorities on Earth are worried that the replicants will do the same here.All of this is really nothing more than a faint attempt at a story.  Blade Runner's success lies not with its story element, but with the amazing vision of fantasy and fear of its director, Ridley Scott.  Scott had previously made ""Alien"", another postmodern vision of man's possible future. In that film he questioned colonisation, globalization (but on a intergalactic scale), our fascination with destriction and the corruption of modern business.  In ""Blade Runner"", Scott explores corruption, man's destructive nature, but he also delves into emotion and the possibility of someone ELSE creating those emotions for us, as is the case for the replicants.The plot plays second fiddle to the set design and costumes.  The choice of Los Angeles being the setting for the film is brilliant: at present L.A. is a city blanketed in sunshine, with an image of blonde babes and surfers all too obvious.  In ""Blade Runner"" the city is nothing like it is today.  It has become a blend of Tokyo, New York and some Eastern European wasteland of pollution.The vehicle, weapons and costumes all have a distinctive 1980's - apocalyptic - retro feel to them, the flying cars are almost too cheesy to be taken seriously, but combined with Vangelis' synthesizer score and the noir-ish feel of the narrative they fit just perfectly.""Blade Runner""'s narrative is just that: film noir.  Deckard is akin to Sam Spade, he's seen it all, been there and back, and is a tortured soul.  It's got the femme fatale, the more evil than evil villan and the corporation that is somehow responsible for all this mess.  At the same time the film is a thriller, a western and a science fiction yarn.Harrison Ford is suited as Deckard.  He is the anti-Han Solo or Indiana Jones.  Rutger Hauer is superbly evil too, it is a shame he hasn't been able to follow this up with anything as good.Many films since this have tried to show a world void of any semblances of what we take for granted today, but none have compared to ""Blade Runner"". The film that came closest to it would be the Japanese animation ""Akira"" which also deals with similar themes.Science fiction always succeeds when the viewer is planted in the story one step beyond what might have actually happened.  See Planet of the Apes, Alien, Star Wars, et al.  In ""Blade Runner"" we get a vision of the world as it may actually be one day.  Maybe not 2019, but somewhere down the track the science fiction of films such as these may become science fact.""Blade Runner"" is one of THE definitive sci-fi movies ever made.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Those Who Enjoy Deep Story/Character Flicks Need Not Apply,"A number of years ago (when I was probably too young to be watching it in the first place), I watched ""Blade Runner"" and was utterly confused and disappointed by the whole thing. Cut to the present and now perhaps my favorite film director, Denis Villeneuve, is making ""Blade Runner 2049"" for release this fall. As such, I gave the original ""Blade Runner"" another chance to see if I was perhaps ""missing something"" (it seems to be widely considered one of the best sci-fi flicks ever). While I now understand what the movie is ""supposed to be"", so to speak, I can also better articulate why it won't appeal to a certain viewing audience.For a basic plot summary, ""Blade Runner"" is set in 2019 Los Angeles, where the Tyrell (Joe Turkel) Corporation has begun making human replicant (or ""skin jobs"") cybernetic beings for slave labor in the ""Off-World"" colonies. Predictably, a group of these beings, led by Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), rebel and commandeer a vessel back to Earth, where they will wreak havoc if not dealt with. This is where Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) comes in, as he is the best in the business at dealing with these replicants. Along the way, Deckard comes across a new type of replicant, Rachael (Sean Young), that challenges him in ways not previously seen.There is no doubt that ""Blade Runner"" is based on a very interesting, pure science fiction concept: human consciousness in a machine body. There are thousands of stories that could be told on this topic, and many already have been across cinema. The trouble with ""Blade Runner"", though, is that it doesn't care all that much in digging into the meat-and-potatoes of those stories.Instead, this is a film primarily concocted out of love of noir and setting. Director Ridley Scott (much like he did in his earlier ""Alien"" effort) is vastly more interested in exploring the dark underbelly of a future LA than he is in crafting a really tight story. As such, much of ""Blade Runner"" showcases the aesthetics of the landscape. If you are really into that sort of thing, this movie will rocket up your list.For those more pulled in by story and character development, however, ""Blade Runner"" only gives out as many nuggets as it needs to in his department. In fact, most of the context of the entire picture is given in an opening text crawl. There are a few ""story moments"" scattered throughout the movie, but they are truly few and far between and too short to satisfy those looking for them.So, I think the litmus test of whether a viewer will enjoy ""Blade Runner"" comes down to how much you enjoy the noir/aesthetic of a film, as that is the film's primary purpose. Does it touch on some interesting ideas/characters? Yes. Does it explore them in any deeper fashion? Absolutely not.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A futuristic allegory about the value of life,"OK, I admit...the first time I watched this movie I detested it. But hey, I was 16 years old and had expected an action-packed sci-fi adventure. Blade Runner is not such a film. But I am grateful for this, for after maturing a bit and rewatching the movie a couple of times, I discovered its greatness. It is not a traditional sci-fi movie, it's a touching drama about the value of life and the importance of making the most of what you've got. One of the most important themes in the film is the question of what is more valuable - humans without emotions, or machines with? The film gives no answer - it just opens our eyes and makes us aware that we should be grateful for being alive.Some people prefer the Director's Cut, but I like the original version better - mostly because of the wonderful end line: ""I didn't know how long we had together. Who does?"" That pretty much sums it up.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Still a classic,"I first saw this movie on a rented Betamax video when I was about 8 or 9. It came across as a really sinister and bleak sci-fi movie at the time.  I enjoyed it as a young kid, but guess I didn't really understand fully the themes behind the movie. I saw the vastly superior and definitive Directors Cut many years later and I instantly rated it as one of the best movies ever.  And this is why:To fully understand how good this movie is, you have to put it into the context of it's era.  When it was released it broke new ground and became what is still up to this day an unrivaled benchmark in sci-fi cinema.It was the first film to depict with such lavish splendor the nightmarish vision of future Earth.  Set in post apocalyptic Los Angeles, the film tells the tale of Deckard (Harrison Ford), a semi retired cop who is persuaded back into his role of a Blade Runner (special units trained to identify and kill outlawed androids, or ""replicants"", who illegally return to Earth). His task is to hunt and destroy a band of off-world androids, led by Rutger Hauer, who fight their way back to Earth to confront their maker, the ingenious Tyrell, head of the monstrous Tyrell Corporation.The film is dark and broody. The photography is exquisite throughout and Vangelis' musical score is a now a classic masterpiece in itself.  Director Ridley Scott's melancholy vision is so stylish and smooth that the film is able to emerse you into its chilling future world from the very first shot. Visually, this is one of the most gorgeous films I've seen.Deckard's character is similar to that of a film noir private detective. He comes across as a somewhat washed up and helpless soul lost in the polluted rat race.  This film provides Rutger Hauer with his defining moment on film, a role I think he has failed to live up to since.  With his fellow replicants, he seeks answers that only his creator can provide - all replicants all built with a lifespan of only four years and they are determined that their fate can be altered.The reason the film is so popular is that it asks so many probing questions which, in 20 years of movies since the film came out, have rarely been asked since.The themes look at humanity and the meaning and life.  Should we really create ""people"" and choose their fate and mortality?  If we choose to play god then we must be answerable to those who we create.  Is there any real difference between life created naturally and that in a laboratory?  And so do we really now what we are?  Or why we are?  Or who created us?The film is inspired by the Philip K Dick novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?""  Although this movie introduced me to reading countless Dick novels, I've deliberately resisted reading this one.  Consequently, I can't comment on how it compares although I know the book is substantially different in places.The movie is quite slow paced, although ""smooth"" is a better word.  Die hard action fanatics might not like this film although sci-fi lovers will embrace it instantly.  In the current age of computer generated effects this film is looking only very slightly dated, but that shouldn't put people off.  Even now, the ambience of Blade Runner is still unsurpassed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Style over substance,"The similarities between the film and the Philip K. Dick novel are coincidental. If you read Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep you are bound to be disappointed that it is nothing like the film and you cannot imagine Harrison Ford as Rick Deckard.I admire the film more for its technical aspects and stunning visuals. I never had the opportunity to see this on a big screen. I imagine that it was something to behold. But the story itself is more or less just a routine cops and robbers scenario with some sci-fi dressings. When I first saw it it still had the much disliked voiceover narration by Harrison Ford. Many years later I saw one of the numerous alternate cuts which abandoned the narration. I found the film even more dull without it, but removing it from the final moments with Rutger Hauer was absolutely correct and gives the scene a deeper emotional impact as we project our own thoughts at what was happening. It is by far the best scene in the entire film.I am by no means the first person to suggest that the film would have been vastly improved had Rutger Hauer's Batty and the escaped androids been the central characters and Rick Deckard given slightly less screen time, especially the flat romance between him and Rachel (played by Sean Young). It takes up too much screen time and adds nothing of greater interest to the overall story. Both look like they are sleepwalking through their performances. The truly interesting characters are those androids in search of their creator in order to extend their limited lifespan. It is a theme se can all relate to. Just when we've gotten to understand our lives it's over, and all our memories are, as Batty so poignantly states, are lost in time like ""tears in the rain"". But these characters are far from noble or heroic and places us in a moral grey area and suggest the idea: How far would you go to extend your life. Batty, being an android, does not have these moral obstacles and will get to his objective by any means necessary. This could have been a truly thought-provoking film but if not for that final confrontation between Batty and Deckard it would be just an over produced police procedural. The music by Vangelis is quite haunting and adds to the otherworldly quality. The film visually arresting but emotionally empty. It was the first blu-ray I bought on account of those visuals, especially being the age before CGI effects. The miniature work is awesome.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
I've Seen The Future And It Will Be,"I often hear similar stories of people's first experiences watching Blade Runner, finding the film dull but coming to appreciate it years later - my story has the same trajectory. I first tried to watch Blade Runner (of what I believe was The Final Cut) on TV in Christmas 2009, only to stop watching after half an hour due to boredom. Over the years, however, I would be compelled to return to Blade Runner several times and get more out of it with each viewing. The tech-noir world of Blade Runner is one to get lost in with its use of neon and many billboards of geishas, albeit a more depressing, dystopian one than say that of Star Wars; one in which the city of Los Angeles appears to be stuck in a state of perpetual darkness and it very frequently rains. Now when watching Blade Runner, I'm watching a movie set in the past date of November, 2019. Once again, like Star Wars, the technology present is highly contradictory, this is a world in which flying cars exist and photographs have unimaginably high pixel counts, yet they still use CRT televisions and mobile phones don't appear to exist. It contradictions like these which we can observe in the real world just adds to the unique and fantasy aspect of the Blade Runner universe.The visual style of Blade Runner has since become a massive cliché - often imitated but never equaled. It feels like every shot or background prop has a story to tell such as those many photographs in Rick Deckard's apartment. The man-cave interior of Deckard's apartment is perfectly suited to his loner personality, a classic world-weary noir protagonist. The film's blurring of the lines between what is human and what is machine results in me always having to remind myself that these replicants of whose plight I've drawn emotional investment towards, are not humans at the end of the day. Why should I feel sorry for the vulnerable replicant Rachael with her smudged eye makeup created from her tears? Blade Runner provokes many a thought of what it means to be human. I suspect the appearance of Rachael must have come about from a desire to create an ideal woman since nobody else in Blade Runner casually dresses like a 1940's femme fatale (I haven't heard of anyone else note Rachael has a strong resemblance to Rosalind Russell in My Sister Eileen from 1942). Likewise, I don't want to know if Deckard is a replicant or not, I prefer the ambiguity and the mystery along with the many unanswered questions of this universe.The love scene between Deckard and Rachael is one of the greatest in cinema history. The sexual tension builds up as a shirtless Deckard wipes away the blood of his face and Rachael lets her hair loose. Subsequently, the manner in which Deckard prevents Rachael from leaving the apartment as he shuts the door with his fist and then proceeds to kiss her along with the saxophone solo from the love them being as close to cheesy as it can get without it being so, brings the swoon factor up to 11. My shallow desires just wish the extended, deleted version of the scene was left in any of the version of the film (in the 80's Sean Young got to have a sex scene with both Harrison Ford and Kevin Costner).The effects of globalization as seen in Blade Runner present L. A. (or at the very least one portion of the city) having Japanese inhabitants as the majority population. If the filmmakers were intending to make accurate predictions of the future, the world of Blade Runner would be more likely dominated by Chinese influence. What Blade Runner does reflect accurately about our modern world is the increasingly oppressive corporate culture and the surveillance of everyday life. There are no evident signs of government in Blade Runner yet corporations rule the roast as the Mayan pyramid-shaped headquarters of the Tyrell Corporation dominates the skyline. Like Cyberdyne Systems in The Terminator and Omni Consumer Products in Robocop, 1980's pulp sci-fi tried to warn us of the dangers of unbridled corporate power. Such power is seen turning in on itself as the film's corporate overlord, the slimy, dubious Eldon Tyrell with his magnificent glasses succumbs to a gruesome death in the only moment of the film in which I want to avert my eyes from the screen in a classic case of the Frankenstein monster turning on its creator. It's little often pointed out that Tyrell's death is very similar to the murder of Mr. Gaines in The Manchurian Candidate (1962). In both films, the murders take place at night in the victim's bedroom as they are lying in bed reading. Both characters are wearing a robe while having a chessboard, statues of animals and candles next to their beds.Lucas and Spielberg gave special editions a bad name, but Ridley Scott's Final Cut of Blade Runner actually shows they have a place (providing the option of viewing the original still exists). There are no pointless CGI additions and it fixes the niggling technical flaws of the original such as the shot of Roy Batty's dove flying towards the sky. While I appreciate the Final Cut, there is a charm to those imperfections of the original, showing that even the masters can make mistakes. I will also defend the voice-over narration present in the theatrical version. It's not up to the poetic quality of Fred MacMurray in Double Indemnity and is hokey but I find it endearingly so and does make the plot easier to follow and gives the film a bit more character (plus we get to hear Harrison Ford drop the ""N"" word).Blade Runner is by no means a nihilistic film, rather it is one that shows beauty in despair (the original ending shows that green pastures apparently still exist in this world of ecological ruin). This display of goodness, truth and beauty culminates in Roy Batty's final 42 word Tears In The Rain monologue, as the obviously Christ-like figure conjures magnificent images of Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion and C-beams glittering in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate to the magnificent score by Vangelis. The Blade Runner soundtrack is one of the few film scores in which I can listen to the entire thing (even John Williams Ladd Company jingle is awe-inspiring). It is the perfect accompaniment to walking down any urban landscapes at night (I can recall multiple mornings when I would listen to Tears In The Rain as the sun would rise back when I worked night shifts) as oneself reflects over its romantic nature and harkens for nostalgia, often and like the replicants in the movie, for memories we don't even have.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
One of those films that requires a second viewing,"When I saw this movie the first time, I found it boring, meandering, pointless and utterly lifeless.  This time around I paid closer attention to the film and it grew on me.  I was intrigued by the original--though somewhat slow-moving--storyline.  The sets are elaborate and beautifully constructed.  Yet the lighting is low-key and the atmosphere is filled with smoke, giving it that neo-noir touch.  So this is not your conventional science-fiction movie.  There are no spaceship battles or goofy robots. Harrison Ford is not playing Han Solo from the ""Star Wars"" movies; this is totally different.  The performances are good all-around.  But I will still say that the film does drag.  I would edit a portion out of almost every scene.  It's obvious that Ridley Scott didn't have the pacing in mind.  And what was with that friggin' soundtrack??  Did Kenny G do the score?  I know Scott was attempting to give it a noirish feel, but the score needed to be a tad more upbeat--I mean we're not sitting in a dentist's chair for God's sake!""Blade Runner"" is not a great film, in my opinion, but a good one and pretty well-done.  I liked the ending; it wasn't predictable.  I'm surprised at how high it ranked on the IMDB:  It's Number 74!  I know the film bombed at the box office and received unanimously bad reviews, so it must've received a major cult following.  I don't have enough enthusiasm to vote this as one of the best underrated films ever made, but it's worth a look.

The pinnacle of quality film making. ( A+ Movie) My Ratings 10/10,"Magic. The stuff books are made of. Palpable, dreamlike, experimental, industrial and just pure magic. When a film is this flawed and yet still floors absolutely everyone with its power to command tone and its ability to influence and yet still stand alone, it's clearly worthy of the praise and the acclaim. There are very few cyberpunk movies and even less good ones. Blade Runner is simply the best one. It's also a work of art and one of the best movies ever made. There are moments where Harrison Ford's Deckard aches with deep sadness, a lost soul himself looking out over the wretchedness that has become of the world, shaking and confused when he buys a bottle of vodka immediately after retiring his 'first' replicant. In these moments it doesn't matter either way if he is a replicant or not, amidst all the more well-known highlights of this classic, these humanising and most overlooked moments are why I love it so deeply.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Finest hour.,"This is simply Scott's finest hour. There are a sheer plethora of futuristic films with vision. Films which crudely grope into a possible time ahead,when perhaps a post apocalyptic era is scattered with cliché upon cliché and often miss the whole point. What Ridley Scott achieved with this film,is an entirely possible scenario. It really does feel like a science fiction novel brought to life,but not so much as its derivative penned by Phillip K Dick(do androids dream of electric sheep?). Its a grimy,violent world inhabited by the sick,lower class,villainous second citizens who haven't quite made the grade for the off world colonies. We have a true smelting pot of nationalities.The heavy eastern references within china town like inner cities is particularly poignant.This film also sees Ford in perfect casting.Theirs a rye charm that Ford has that no other actor could fake or fill quite as effortlessly. Its a mixed review depending on what version you have seen. For me,the directors cut is simply too cut. I preferred the audience friendly screening which had the wonderful narration. The finest moment with this narration has to be the moments described by Batty in his dying eyes and the summing up by Ford of this man/machines passion and love for life.. No other sci-fi futuristic film has ever made the grade before or since in my humble opinion. It captured the raw smells and light of a brutal future scarily depicted in films or even so well. From the chase scene with Zora to the flybys over the city capturing a stunning skyline,chimneys and skyscrapers in one shot. This is my favourite movie of all time for all the reasons above and many more i could effortlessly type all day and night.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The best Rutger Hauer's work,"I saw this movie somewhere in the early 90s when I studied at school. Those were times when former USSR still existed and it was very hard to find any information about movies or actors. This movie was showed on some TV channel with bad quality and offscreen translator snuffled. I didn't know the names of actors and even missed the movie's title but I could not forget the movie and a face of the main replicant. This face haunted me. Only in 1994 I suddenly saw it again in a paper and found out that it was Rutger Hauer. He became my favourite actor. Maybe it's his only movie where the depth of his talent met the equal depth of a movie itself. Also I don't remember any other movie in which almost all episodic or secondary characters have such a memorable appearance. None the worse is the soundtrack written by Vangelis, but the great discovery for me was to hear the whole album ""Blade runner. The original movie soundtrack"" which I regard as one of the best album in the discography of Vangelis.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
So ahead of its time,"Both one of the more influential and ahead of its time films in history. This look into a future of 2019 that thankfully we've never come close to, has many versions and I believe I've seen them all. Yesterday, I watched the director's cut, which I saw once in a theatrical reissue, is the best. The poorly studio conceived narration is gone and the ending has been improved. By now everyone knows that this is about replicants, artificial people to do our bidding with short expiration dates, rebelling and wanting more life. The casting is superb for this type of thing. Ford is strong in the lead and Sean Young has never been better nor has she ever looked so amazing. Add in Rutger Hauer in I think what would be his signature role along with a great supporting cast too long to list here that are flawless. Ridley Scott is to be commended for commanding this ship of fine performances, awesome production design, great special effects and magnificent cinematography with a haunting musical score. The fact that Jordan Cronenweth's cinematography was not Oscar nominated just makes the Academy look ridiculous.

But I guess the memory data has been corrupted throughout the years.While the setting and atmosphere was nothing short of spectacular in Ridley's ""Blade Runner"" from 1982, then the movie was just incredibly slow in progressing anywhere. And once it actually kicked into high speed, it ended within 10 minutes!The acting was quite good and they did indeed have a very good ensemble of acting performers on the cast list. Harrison Ford, of course, carried the movie phenomenally. And he was joined nicely on the screen by the likes of Rutger Hauer, Daryl Hannah, M. Emmet Walsh and Edward James Olmos.The special effects in ""Blade Runner"" were good, especially when taking into consideration the age of the movie.

One of the Best Looking Dark Films Ever Made,"Blade Runner (1982)** 1/2 (out of 4) Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is one of the best Blade Runner's in the business. A Blade Runner is a person who is paid to go after illegal replicants and the most recent case has him going after four including the sadistic Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer).Ridley Scott's BLADE RUNNER was released with minor fans but overtime it grew into what many consider one of the greatest science fiction movies ever made. It's really hard to judge or rate this movie because it's available in so many different versions. This viewing here was actually the third version I've seen and I gotta say that if you have to keep re-editing, adding and altering a movie then I question how good it is to begin with.I know many people consider BLADE RUNNER to be one of the greatest movies ever made. I honestly get their reaction but I certainly don't share it. The film is certainly one of the most brilliantly looking movies ever made. Visually this film is rather incredible as director Scott has no problem creating the mood of this dark city as well as the rather grim nature. The special effects, costume design, sets and music score are all flawless and perfectly capture a terrific vision.With that said, I think there's a lot more style than substance here. Not for a second did I ever get totally involved in the ""story"" going on. I thought it was a rather interesting idea but storywise there's nothing great here. I also thought the slow nature was a bit too boring. I know this is a thinking man's approach but it just didn't work with me. With that said, the ending is quite excellent and I thought the scenes between Ford and Hauer were extremely effective.The performances from the entire cast is another major plus with Ford perfect in the role, which is a throwback to the type of detectives that we'd see in film noir titles of the 40s and 50s. Hauer makes for a great villain and we get nice support from Sean Young, M. Emmet Walsh, Edward James Olmos, William Sanderson, Joe Turkel and Daryl Hannah among others.Again, I understand why some call BLADE RUNNER one of the greatest films ever made. In my opinion, the original theatrical cut is quite poor. The Director's Cut was certainly an improvement. Having now just watched ""The Final Cut"" it reall didn't improve too much from the director's cut. As is, I'd probably recommend the Director's Cut.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
important sci-fi film,"Early in the 21st Century, the Tyrell Corporation advanced Robot evolution into the NEXUS phase known as Replicants. Replicants were used Off-world as slave labor, in the hazardous exploration and colonization of other planets. After a bloody mutiny, they were declared illegal on earth and Blade Runner units were created to retire trespassing Replicants. It's 2019 Los Angeles. Policeman Gaff (Edward James Olmos) brings in ex-blade runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford). Bryant (M. Emmet Walsh) orders him to track down four escaped Nexus 6 models. Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) leads Zhora (Joanna Cassidy), Leon Kowalski (Brion James) and Pris (Daryl Hannah). Deckard goes to test the new Nexus 6 model by using the machine on Rachael (Sean Young). Dr. Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkel) hasn't told her. The Replicants track down Hannibal Chew (James Hong) and J.F. Sebastian (William Sanderson) to meet Tyrell.I remember first seeing this on cable with the happy ending. It remains the version I like the most despite its inherit contradiction. I still like the shock of the green with the Vangelis music driving into the future. Also I like the voice-overs despite their detractors. I love the final voice-over during the happy ending which is eliminated in the final cut. In addition, I cannot abide by Deckard being a Replicant. This is great cyberpunk vision of the future. Its designs are still influential. I love the hard-boiled noir genre being married to a sci-fi movie. It does move slowly in the middle but I accept that flaw. It is meticulous and detailed visually. The Philip K. Dick story is compelling. It remains an important sign post in the sci-fi genre.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A classic neo-noir and sci-fi film with great themes,"This is a slow moving sci-fi film but it has great themes. It's about a man in the police force who's hired to kill 4 murderous replicants. It's mostly slow-paced but its engaging climax and great production choices are what makes it such a masterpiece. Its themes require audience's to think rather than experience. The voice overs are unnecessary but later cuts are devoid of them. Ridley Scott has proved to be a visionary artist here by producing a bleak society where it's always dark and raining. Its climax serves as an iconic portrayal of ""man vs. machine"". Its climax is very moving and engaging and it's one of the more memorable scenes from the 80's. Then at the last shot, the movie pulls the rug out from under you. I liked the cinematography. It made the movie look bleak and it made the society look like it was dwindling. The acting was strong on all parts especially coming from Harrison Ford. Because of this movie's production choices, I can see why it's as famous as it is today. Unfortunately, it failed at the box office probably because it came out 2 weeks later than E.T. the Extra Terrestrial. But it has become a cult classic and today it's regarded as of the best sci-fi and neo-noir films.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
He was dreamed of a unicorn,"After watching the Blade Runner, he dreamed about a unicorn, it reminds me I dreamed it as well, once.No, it's not one, it's they.I remembered at that time I could only feel pure joy, as if I was holding a telescope,
Like childhood play toy,
What does it mean, that was my most beautiful time out of reality, it's in dream.It says: The unicorn symbolism is linked to purity, freedom, gentleness, virginity, innocence, divinity, and magic. Christians believe that the unicorn symbol is that of Christ and Mother Mary themselves. Seeing unicorns in dreams is inevitably a sign of good luck, happiness, and a positive omen.Aren't we like Deckard, but the only difference is : he knew he live in a world where there is the replicants and the human, so he could be one of the two , but we don't have any doubt absolutely with the world we live in, as a fan of Sci-fi movies, after watching them ( the blade runner, Matrix) , you will start to doubt yourself, if memory and feeling could implant in our brain, I mean , if it just some thing like putting a button inside you then triggering you having a certain reaction, that was a kind of I don't know, it's a very weird feeling, gives you a shiver.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Human ambition,"There are several extraordinary things about Blade Runner.1) It does not state who's good and who's bad. 2) It throws you into a scenario that you'll probably not enjoy. 3) It doesn't bother to explain why things are the way they are. 4) It shows us something that, although it doesn't exist anywhere, still has an existential meaning to us.Apart from that Blade Runner has the best score ever. Vangelis created a style that in its simplicity strikes you far more as being of the future than any more sophisticated electronic music could ever do.The thing I was referring to in 4. is a grown up without experiences of his own. That is a logical impossibility, a paradox. But paradoxically it's one of the most powerful stimuli of existential reflection that were ever shown in cinema. The point being that it lets you ask yourself what all your experiences were good for.Not quite so subtle, yet still of interest, is the idea that you could be born into life knowing full well what your purpose is and how long you'll live. What does that do to you? The film answers that though, it's unacceptable, you'll deny it, seek something else, something more. It just cannot be that everything will be lost like tears in rain.But human ambition is a much broader theme of this film. The world itself, in which Blade Runner takes place, is a statement about the human longing for progress and power, his forwardness and his backwardness. Some concepts seem ridiculous from nowadays perspective, but the overall atmosphere is right on the spot. And in this respect I have to say that the original cut has the better ending, because of the contrast, because of all the emotions that are awakened by that contrast, which does not appear cheesy, but rather estranged, a release into the completely unknown.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A must watch for fans of science fiction,"I thought Blade Runner was a groundbreaking film when it was first released 41 years ago, and it still holds relevance today. Despite the fact that the graphics and pace of modern films have advanced significantly, the unique aesthetic of Blade Runner, which blends film noir with science fiction, is still impressive. That being said, I did have some issues with the film. The transitions between scenes were sometimes awkward, and I felt that the character development could have been handled better. Some character choices felt out of place, and it was hard to understand their motivations. Additionally, some of the content in the film, particularly the relationship between Deckard and Rachael, felt problematic by today's standards.That being said, what I enjoyed most about Blade Runner were the philosophical and existential questions it raised. The film made me think about the nature of memory, identity, and the ethics of creating and controlling artificial life forms. The replicants' struggle for autonomy and their eventual demise was particularly thought-provoking. My favorite moment in the film was when Roy saved Deckard's life, which highlighted the complexity of the replicants' emotions and their capacity for compassion.Overall, while Blade Runner may not be perfect, its themes and questions remain relevant and make it worth watching, especially for those who appreciate science fiction and philosophical musings.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

In reality, they are loath to admit that it's a boring, overrated piece of cinematographic crap that nobody outside the community actually likes. Even though I've had all my life to watch this movie, I've never made it the whole way through in one sitting. In fact, I've seen more of Flash Gordon and Conan in one sitting than I have of this movie (and the fact that I made it almost all the way through both Guru and Gigli is a testament to my unwillingness to turn away from a movie once I start to watch them).

The other four replicants he is chasing are the nexus 6 model, a strong new advance replicants used for military which makes Deckards chase more dangerous, but their crime is they want more life.The movie has a very strong philosophy in the story, what is real and what is not, is Deckard human or not, and do replicants have feelings or are they implants.

Blade Runner is amazing,"I actually appreciated the audio best because, even in this new Blu-Ray era, one doesn't often find a film with very active surround speakers. However, this ""restored"" version did and the sound is, at the point, the best I've heard on a Blu-Ray disc....or any DVD, for that matter. The visuals? Well, fans of Blade Runner know all about them. They are fantastic. Scene-after-scene reminded me of a Stanley Kubrick film or another bizarre 1980s movie called ""Jacob's Ladder."" Because there are so many things to see and hear, and the story is different, one filled with strange characters, I can see where people would watch this film multiple times and enjoy it very much each time. The ""Collector's Edition"" has the best picture ever, according to director Ridley Scott, and ""is the version I'm most pleased with."" It has added scenes one didn't see in earlier versions. The rest of the DVD has those earlier versions. Apparently, there are several including those with Harrison Ford doing narration, like out of a late '40s film noir.Speaking of the latter, that's what this film looked like: a combination film noir (or neo-noir) and sci-fi movie. It has many dark images, fantastic night-time scenes, wonderful closeups and an always-interesting color palette. Sci-fi films usually get dated in a hurry, thanks to ever-increasing special-effects progress in the movie industry, but this still looks very good.

There really just didn't seem to be much there that would qualify this film to be considered a classic.I watched as a tribute to Harrison Ford. He had that same edge that he had in Raiders of the Lost Ark, released the year before. He had a maturity that was missing in Star Wars. He was totally believable in this role.But that was it.

I Don't Like It; I Watch It Anyway,"I've seen Blade Runner many, many times. It may hold the record for Most Times I Have Seen a Movie I Don't Actually Like. Like most people, I admire the look of the film. I don't know that I appreciate the look as much as others; while I admit it was very influential on the look of subsequent movies, its style-over-substance nature has also been influential, and I don't think that's a good thing. And, again like most people, I am intrigued by the subject matter (what is human?).That's about it for the things I like. As for what I don't like, well, first off, I'm one of those Philip K. Dick fans. There is a lot more going on in the book Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? than shows up in the movie (and yes, I know that's the standard complaint of book lovers, but it's true here). The most important missing element in the movie is ""Mercerism,"" a semi-religion that is v.important in the book's philosophy. In any event, I don't think Blade Runner does a good job of getting at much essential Dickworld. For me, the best example of that world on film remains the scene in Total Recall when the bad guys try to convince Arnold in the hotel room that he is actually sitting back home in a chair enjoying a virtual, rather than real, experience.As for the non-Dickian aspects of the movie, well, if you've heard from the legions of Blade Runner fans what a classic it is, you'll likely be surprised on first viewing to find out that it's kinda boring. Apparently to help make the point that the emotional lives of humans and replicants are too similar to tell apart, director Ridley Scott instructs the actors playing humans (or supposed humans) to underplay, to make them seem more mechanical, then lets King of the Replicants Rutger Hauer overact oddly, as if he was a leftover from Kubrick's Clockwork Orange (another so-called classic with crappy acting from everyone not named Malcolm McDowell). I guess Hauer's bogus emoting is supposed to make him seem more human than the humans, but this is only true if humans are scenery-chewers.Ultimately, it's hard to care about any of the characters in the film. I suppose that could be one of the ""points"" it's trying to make; I suspect it's more what happens when you cast dull-as-nails Sean Young in a leading role. Again, I'm aware that this distancing-from-humanity feel could be on purpose. That doesn't make it any more enjoyable. The movie gets everything right except the people. As usual, Pauline Kael hit it on the head: ""It hasn't been thought out in human terms. If anybody comes around with a test to detect humanoids, maybe Ridley Scott and his associates should hide.""",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Not What I was Expecting,"As I did not see this movie in its prime but did see Blade Runner 2049 in theatres before ever seeing the first film it could play a factor in my opinion. Now the version I saw was The Final Cut I haven't seen the theatrical release or directors cut version. However the film story seemed very straight forward A Blade Runner must kill all Replicants and as a Detective essentially he goes about his assignment. I am not a Harrison Ford fan by any means I like Star Wars & Indiana Jones but this was a solid performance from Forward. He definitely captures the character very well.However I felt even for a under 2 hour movie this felt like a dull drag. I was intrigued at first and then slowly it began to kind of drag on and I felt somewhat losing interest. I am a huge fan of indie films and strange films but this film just didnt vibe with me.When the we get to the final act and the final face off if you will the way The Final Cut decides to wrap up felt so underwhelming. I do not always need an epic action filled ending but the way this wraps up just left me with ""That's it?"".The pros of this film is Fords performance and the special effects for its time was seriously impressive. The world they take into gives you typical film noir with a sci-fi flare. The world itself feels like a character on its own. But ultimately the delivery, pacing, and story just does not meet the expectations especially with the hype and fan base behind this film. Again I couldve been because I watched Blade Runner 2049 first, I waited too long to see it, or maybe I watched the wrong version for myself.

Never been equalled,"Many have praised this one before me, so I will try to keep my comment brief. One of the few movies which still towers majestically over the majority of SF-movies produced before or since. I rate this, along with 2001 and Solaris, as masterpieces of cinema which take the medium to another level. Funny that there are three SF-movies on my top ten movies of all time. In this age of CGI, the environment created for this film has still never been equalled. It is not just the intense layering and detail, it is also the pace which we move through the environment that is just as important. Allowing us time to rest and contemplate the surroundings, along with the magnificent music, brings out so much more atmosphere and sense of place. The acting is interesting, mixing low-key realism with the highly theatrical style of Hauer and Turkel. Yet that mixing never feels out of place. Also, the important ingredient Ridley has in BR that has been lacking in some of his subsequent efforts, is a rich, multi-levelled story. The existential aspects, what is human, real versus artificial memories, the unanswered questions. Almost all movies I consider to be masterpieces have an unanswered question at the end and which brings me back for subsequent watchings. This is one of them. May it soon appear on a Special Ed. DVD with tons of extras.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Have A Better One!,"The Godfather 2 of Sci-Fi. Watching this is an almost transcendental experience that transports you into the best world-building ever put on the big screen.I've never seen cyberpunk so well realized, and to think this was all made in 1980 with real sets, real lighting, and real weather effects makes it all the more mind-blowing.Based off an alternative timeline that began in sprawl/freeway inception of the 1950s, Blade Runner combines 20th century concepts like hyper scale globalization, environmental collapse, and techno-obsessive city planning to project a sort of nightmarish collage of all our old and present fears about the rot of modernity by showing us a vision of 2019 Los Angeles as a city of 100 million global refugees (likely because of a small scale nuclear war which made most cities uninhabitable and caused many to migrate here).The way this movie portrays depth and claustrophobia is masterful. I really feel like I'm an inhabitant of this insane nightmare city whenever we see its dozens of outdoor sequences.Storywise it's one of the greats of science fiction history as well. It's a slow-burning atmospheric thriller that stuns you with how well it's intellectual ideas blend with the overall film and aren't in your face or too hard to notice.

80s cyberpunk piece sees visionary Ridley Scott taking Phillip K. Dick's inspiring source material and spinning into cinematic mastery,"Ridley Scott's cyberpunk thriller Blade Runner inspired by the short novel by Phillip K. Dick is a film with a reputation that grew following its trouble history with its studio. The debacle started with Scott facing studio interference that lead to re-edits that neither him or lead star Harrison Ford were satisfied with, especially with its dour performance at the box office. The ordeal was followed with re-edits that made their way into the Director's Cut Edition released on home media ten years later. However, it wasn't until Scott polished with the film with a final makeover, renovating the picture to his most satisfying form known as the Final Cut in 2007. What comes of the final product is a stylish futuristic sci-fi piece showing the director operating at arguably his finest fashion. Scorching with a dazzlingly rich visual heft and narrative that breathes a chock load of ambition. It is blistering sci-fi spectacle blooming with elements that have carried influence on many cyberbunk entries in later years including 'Dark City', 'Ghost in The Shell', and 'The Matrix' to name of few. Now that is a definition of a groundbreaking picture. Harrison Ford plays Rick Deckard, a local police officer in the futuristic city of Los Angeles in 2019, a city rattled by crime and economic depression. Deckerd is assigned to a daunting task of assassinating four emotionless androids known as Replicants. These otherworldly beings are humanoids who are disguised as regular humans. And the worst part, they happen to be responsible for the theft a spaceship. When he closes in the leader of the group Rachael (played by Seana Young), the only one born with emotion, Deckerd begins to question his identity.In age when science-fiction was the household for mainly aliens, intergalactic warfare, and post-apocalyptic settings; Blade Runner offered something not entirely seminal but highly underpopulated in the genre, and expanded upon it with ideas not many, if any, filmmakers dared to attempt before. This is where the visionary mind of Ridley Scott is poured into with no restraint of ambition. Set in a futuristic society completed with an eye-dazzling visual design that many (especially back in the day of its initial release) could describe as groundbreaking, the film transpires with a plot stitched together with a plethora of twists and turns that leave audiences' head throbbing with questions of Deckard's identity. Is he the man he always believed he is, or is there a secret hidden within his transparent being? As the events unfold into a steadily paced game of cat-and-mouse with sudden bursts of intense gunplay, conspiracy permeates the grim atmosphere to the point where the most intriguing elements lie not within the questions that are answered but the ones that are left unanswered. The story, uprooted marvelously from the script by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples, is handled with grace and moves at pace that may prove to be too sluggish for some, but nonetheless allows the for the characters to build and for the plot to bulk up for the cutthroat climax. If you grab a hold of the Final Cut edition, you avoid the unnecessary Harrison Ford narration that bears seemingly no significant purpose. And as for Ford, fresh from his debut in the 'Indiana Jones' franchise', the actor puts on a performance that is more than desirable. There is a fair steam of charisma smoking through his performance. Sean Young remains solid in her role, but nothing that knocks for sheer impression. She just does enough to show she is talented and fitting for the role.Blade Runner is a profoundly engaging cyberpunk piece that broke many grounds for establishing powerful elements that have inspired many entries of the genre today. And the accomplished ambition of Ridley Scott's directorial methodology is what holds the film as one of the most influential sci-fi flicks of its generation. Now that is a fine achievement for a film uprooted from a tortured history.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"The Film That Started The Question ""What Makes Us Human?""","A 1982 Science-Fiction film set in the year 2019 Los Angeles. Here, synthetic humans known as replicants are bio-engineered by the powerful Tyrell Corporation to work on off-world colonies. When a fugitive group of Nexus-6 replicants led by Roy Batty escapes back to Earth, burnt-out cop Rick Deckard reluctantly agrees to hunt them down.This was yet another film I had to watch for my Filmic Text class that I had never seen before. I know it's regarded as one of the ""greatest science-fiction films of all time"", but I'm going to argue that Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" is a far superior film. That's not to say ""Blade Runner"" was a bad film, it's not but I have my gripes with it. Let's start off with the positives though. The clear argument about humanity, more specifically what makes us human is very interesting to me. Also the replicants themselves have enough depth to them where they were interesting as well, and how it's determined if they are replicants is quite cool. The futuristic sets that mix futuristic los angeles and asian culture was a really stellar idea, though it's borders on racist at times. We really didn't need to cut to a geisha billboard throughout the film. Moving onto one of the negatives, the pacing. It felt dragged down at parts, without tension like shown in ""Alien"" this kind of pacing is felt amongst viewers.Rachael's character I could relate to the most, but seeing how important her character really is to the plot she should've been present more. Also the argument of ""that scene"" between Deckard and Rachael in his apartment is not justified because of the year this was made. It's ironic how a film like this could have a scene like that that's supposed to be set in 2019 whereas its that year now and that would not fly in the slightest nowadays! It's way too sexual assaulty for me to be comfortable watching it, when clearly it's intended to be ""romantic"" by the choice of jazz music and lighting. This is the one scene that I agreed with my class that felt completely out of place and against Deckard's character thus far.No I have not seen all versions of the film and I'm not going to. It's a little asinine to me when people claim that you ""have to watch all versions"" in order to grasp the full concept of the film. No I'm pretty sure I got the idea from whatever version I saw, its Harrison Ford running around being Harrison Ford. With cool visuals and relevant concept, even more so in current day than when it was released.

One to re-watch over and over...,"How this film has been underrated when it came out (mediocre, dull etc)!This is one of the very few films I like to re-watch from time to time. Ultimately this is not something I do for the story. Although I sometimes find new content here and there, things I missed the first time, the major reason to re-watch films like this is:-the astounding visuals (watch it in High Definition and be amazed, factor 10);-the music, I love Vangelis' unique soundtrack because he managed to make jazzy/bluesy synth music;-the atmosphere. Sure, it's all been done before, the film noir routine, but here it engages without being too formulaic.The philosophical themes are interesting too providing plenty of questions if you are interested. Mostly: what does it mean to be human? For instance, watch Rachel cry when she finds out she's not human after all. It evokes a form of pity, because, is she really that different from us? Isn't she worthy of a normal life? Aren't we all machines in a way, following the written routines in our own DNA code? Lack of empathy makes the replicants different from humans, but only for older models. And they get more human by the day. When they get too human they expire...the 4 year lifespan. But like any life form, they want survival. More even, to get the maximum out of the whole experience called life. Human after all?If you're not interested in such questions, this is still a beautiful film for the unequaled visuals, music, atmosphere and acting.I like the simple, original romantic ending, it's less ambiguous than the director's cut and I didn't mind the voice over at all. The director s cut has a completely different climax which is maybe less satisfying but stimulates much more thinking. Both versions endings are good and deserve recognition (particularly the original version has been bashed too much).The film is also better than the book though some would disagree. The book fails in truly capturing the atmosphere of a future where most living things are mechanical because it's one of Dick's less efficient books with a very forgettable ending.

The Best of the Almost Great Movies,"There are so many comments regarding this movie that I doubt anything I write will be seen as relevant. Obviously it's affected a lot of people, because of all the comments here. I saw this movie when it first came out, then I saw it again when they thankfully removed Harrison Ford's voiceovers from it (which he himself didn't think was appropriate for the film.) This film has apparently been re-edited several times, but no matter how many times they do, it will never be completely satisfying. What it needed was one more rewrite at the beginning, with development of one tiny element: the characters.We don't care about the replicants enough; because we don't know enough about them. We don't care about Harrison Ford's character enough, because he kills too soullessly, ""just doing his job"", and doesn't give it a second thought. Which brings me to the movie's biggest deficit: He has no character arc. He doesn't grow or change throughout the movie. Phillip K. Dick mentioned in a rare interview I'm glad I got to read, that he intended the replicants and the character of Deckard to undergo a reversal: the replicants become more human, with a conscience, by the end of the film, and Deckard becomes less and less human because of his actions, until their characters have completely switched. This would have given a satisfying and complete meaning to the film. All the replicants wanted to do was live, not be slaves and to be left alone for the remainder of their brief lives. All Deckard wanted to do was kill them, get paid and go home. No thought given to his actions afterwards.We learn nothing of the replicants' inner feelings except the main one, and then only peripherally. If they had been allowed to emote and to feel pain, we would have empathized with them and had a problem with Deckard killing them. So there really is no-one to empathize with, certainly not Ford, who plays a futuristic Charles Bronson character out of Deathwish, who killed muggers and punks with no emotion whatsoever.Possible Spoiler:One major quibble I have is with the murder of Sebastian, the one (and only) empathetic character out of the whole film. He acts as the unwilling host for two of the replicants, he comes to like them and they seem to like him, but after the head replicant kills Tyrell, the genius who bioengineered the replicants, he goes after Sebastian, and we hear later that the replicant killed him too. Why? This completely undermines the evolution of the replicant towards humanity. We can see why the replicant would kill his creator who created him to be a disposable slave who will die after four years, but a man who had helped him? It was a senseless contradiction and brought us back to square one about caring about the replicants. (Even with Darth Vader, the audience empathized with him a little, being scarred up and a victim of his destiny. He didn't just kill people randomly.)So, there we have it. The reason why, in my opinion, the movie will never be as great as it could be, because nothing changes, and we have no-one (and nothing) to really care about. At the end we're left with a film that creates a sense of mood, and not a moral or meaningful statement. That's too bad; it could have done all of that, with one more rewrite and ten minutes more of developing (i.e., evolving) the characters. Rutger Hauer's ""tears in the rain"" speech at the end unfortunately is not enough to accomplish that by itself.However, I doubt that Ridley Scott cares about any of that, as he endlessly re-edits the visuals in his film......",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Outstanding and tought-provoking inspired the neo-noir genre - watch the Directors Cut ONLY,"Plenty of in-depth analyses can be found on RT or IMDb singing praise of a sci-fi classic that is older than Matrix and Gattaca and yet touches the question of ""What makes a human human?"" more convincingly than virtually all movies that came after it.I'll cut myself short for one message:WATCH THE DIRECTORS CUT. ONLY.The initial reception of Blade Runner in its ""Theatrical Release"" was what it deserved, something around a 7/10. Because it was streamlined for a mass audience upon release, simplified to a detective story. The ""Directors Cut"" rectified this, thankfully, by adding crucial scenes (unicorn, the ""Immortal game"" as Tyrell's chess match) in favour of the botched ending for a much more thought-provoking and enigmatic movie. The slightly inferior, ""Final Cut"" version turned it into more of a modern action movie: Whilst still an enjoyable version to watch, it is a little on the nose, pushing its message forward and lacking the subtlety and precision of the DC. It's also more graphic - which, in this movie, is arguably entirely unnecessary.There is Science Fiction like Terminator, and there is Science Fiction that utilizes a futuristic setting as a stage, set to ask a question. The narrative serves to make it a little more appealing, the profanity to make it a little less pretentious. You may like Sci-Fi or you may find it ludicrous. In times of AI emulating humans better than ever before, this movie is as relevant as it is still entertaining. Watch it, if you like movies that make you think. It's a classic for a reason.

"Although visually stunning, it's superb in every way... story, characters etc.",One of the only films of its kind. Blade Runner is one of my all-time favourite movies!,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
One of the most intelligent and profound science-fiction films of all time,"""Blade Runner"" is, together with the original version of ""Planet of the Apes"", my favourite science-fiction film. The two films ask diametrically opposed questions of fundamental philosophical importance. That posed by ""Planet of the Apes"" is ""What distinguishes humans from animals?""; that posed by ""Blade Runner"" is ""What distinguishes humans from machines?""The film is set in the year 2019. In 1982 that doubtless seemed a long way away, but in 2011 we can see it as yet another sci-fi film which greatly overestimated the speed of technological progress. Fortunately, the quality of science fiction movies is not always dependent on their ability to foretell the future. The central idea of the film is that science has perfected organic robots called replicants, virtually indistinguishable from adult humans, the one difference being that replicants (supposedly) lack emotions. Replicants may only be used for dangerous or menial work in outer space or on other planets; their use on Earth is forbidden. Nevertheless, replicants have been known to defy the ban and return to Earth, where they are hunted down and killed (or ""retired"" to use the official euphemism) by a special police squad known as ""Blade Runners"".The main character is Rick Deckard, a Blade Runner assigned the task of ""retiring"" four returned replicants hiding in Los Angeles. In order to prevent them from developing human emotions, the life-span of replicants is limited to four years, and it is believed that these four have come to earth to force the Tyrell Corporation, which manufactured them, to extend their lives. Another important element in the plot is a romance between Deckard and Rachael, a beautiful young woman whom he later discovers to be a secret replicant. Unlike the other replicants we see in the film, Rachael is a more advanced model who believes herself to be human, having had artificial memories implanted into her mind.Despite its science-fiction theme, ""Blade Runner"" can also be regarded as belonging to the neo-noir genre. Like other neo-noirs from this period, such as ""Chinatown"", ""Body Heat"" and ""Gorky Park"", it has a very distinctive visual style. The city we see is very futuristic, complete with towering buildings and flying cars, and yet for all its high-tech buildings, the Los Angeles of 2019 is a gloomy, rainswept city disfigured by litter, graffiti and poverty, a literal and metaphorical City of Dreadful Night. The atmosphere is reminiscent of 1940s noirs such as ""The Big Sleep"", also set in a dark, rainy Los Angeles, although it is said that director Ridley Scott also drew on his roots in the industrial North-East of England. Since 1982 this dark, moody look has become something of a cliché in science-fiction, horror and superhero movies, but in its day it marked a radical alternative to the bright, gleaming ""Star Wars"" vision of the future.Another typically noir element in the film is the character of Deckard, a disillusioned, world-weary detective of the type who, had the film been made thirty or forty years earlier, would undoubtedly have been played by Humphrey Bogart. Harrison Ford was already known to the public as Han Solo in ""Star Wars"" and Indiana Jones; ""Blade Runner"" was perhaps the film that first revealed him as an intelligent, thoughtful actor as well as an action hero. This, together with ""Witness"" and ""The Fugitive"", is probably his best performance. Sean Young is an actress who has largely disappeared from view in recent years, but in the eighties she was a rising star, and here she gives her one really memorable performance as Rachael, the woman who has to cope with the knowledge that everything she has hitherto believed about herself is a lie. Rachael's hairstyle is a deliberately old-fashioned one, possibly in order to suggest another link with forties film noir. (Sean is one of several female actors of her generation to be known by a male forename; another, Daryl Hannah, appears as one of the four escaped replicants).The third great performance comes from Rutger Hauer as the replicant Roy. Hauer, who is Dutch, speaks English fluently, but with a slight foreign accent, and this is put to good use in the film to suggest a being almost identical to, and yet subtly different from, the human characters. (Rachael's rather formal speech has a similar effect). Roy is believed to be a dangerous, alien being, yet as the film progresses it becomes clear that he and his fellow replicants are fully human souls with their own personalities who have developed in full the emotions they were not supposed to share.A key scene comes near the end, where Roy stretches out his hand to prevent Deckard from falling to his death. This scene called to mind Michelangelo's famous painting of God creating Adam, but reverses its meaning. Deckard is a member of the race which created Roy, and therefore a metaphorical ""god"", but here it is the created being who stretches out his hand to his creator and thereby confers the gift of life on him. In this moving scene we see that the replicants are every bit as capable as humans- if not more so- of experiencing the emotions of pity and compassion.The film initially performed poorly at the box office, but later became recognised as a classic, especially after a ""director's cut"" was released in 1992. (I must admit that I never saw the original version that was released in cinemas; my comments are based upon the director's cut and the more recent ""final cut""). Scott is said to regard ""Blade Runner"" as his most complete and personal film; I would regard it as his finest. There is not enough space here to do justice to all its complexities and shades of meaning, but it must count as one of the best films of the eighties and one of the most intelligent and profound science-fiction films of all time. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Breathtaking,"Even before the plot kicks in, Blade Runner's strangely beautiful neon sci-fi images make this an instant masterpiece. Blade Runner's philosophical plot aligns with it's appealing visuals focusing on how even the smallest things in life are fascinating. Even the most fantastic imagery comes from some of the most basic things, such as smoke from a cigarette glimmering in sunlight. In Blade Runner, Earth has become numb to such a dazzling gift life is, which allows a deeper exploration through Harrison Ford's well preformed slowly realizing Rick Deckard and Rutger Bauer's Roy Batty. It may take a little bit to realize if you lose focus, but Blade Runner is a grimly majestic film that will make you appreciate the little things in life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Attack Ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion,"It must be quietly disconcerting for Ridley Scott that he directed his greatest film in the early 80's with the knowledge that try as he does, he will always find it difficult to improve upon. I watched this masterpiece of a film first time out and loved it from the start - in fact, it's not only my favourite sci-fi film but one of my favourites of all time.Whilst everyone is entitled to an opinion, I do find it laughable that some members of the IMDb community can give this classic a 1 star rating. Many conclude that the film does not live up to the expectations of the book. This of course is a nonsensical argument – the mental images derived from a book cannot be realistically compared to the reality of pictures on the silver screen. Everybody's interpretation is different. In other cases, the deep meaning and natural intelligence of Bladerunner appear to be too much for some. May I suggest these people look under the sections for Steve Seagal and Chuck Norris!These inane comments cannot detract from what is a groundbreaking piece of cinema. In a post apocalyptic Los Angeles where acid rain drenches the city from the gloomy sky above and people who can afford it search for the salvation of off world colonies, we enter the world of the Bladerunner – a specialist law enforcer tasked with the termination of human replicants who have turned 'rogue'.Not an easy task when considering that the human clones in question are difficult to distinguish from the real article. And in Rick Deckard's case (Harrison Ford), the task is to prove all the more difficult as the 'skinjobs' in question start to develop their own feelings and emotions for the first time.Bladerunner is a landmark film because unlike many sci-fi epics, it has stood the test of time. Made only 5 years after the original Star Wars film, the movie has aged incredibly well and looks as fresh and modern now as it did in 1982. More remarkably the film was made before the onset of computer aided graphics, which provides a fitting testament to how well this film is made. Star Wars: A New Hope looks dated – Bladerunner does not.The bleakness of the sets, the quirky dialogue and even quirkier film score by Vangellis, all add together to make a first rate sci-fi thriller which gets better the more times you watch it. Rutger Hauer provides the stand out performance as Roy Batty, the leader of the malfunctioning group, who is a ruthless killer by trade but famously shows compassion for the first time just before he dies as his emotions evolve.The film delves into a number of thought provoking topics including one which has troubled humanity since the beginning of time – how long have we got? Do you want to know or would you rather not? And in our world where genetic modification is raising questions in the medical sector, Bladerunner also poses this same question but some 20 years earlier. Regardless of whether you watch the original or Directors Cut version, this movie stands out as filmmaking of the highest calibre with a realism that everyone can identify with. Watch it in BlueRay for the experience this film deserves.Time to Die? In Bladerunner's case I think not. It'll still look good in 2111.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Classics for all time by Ridley Scott,"It is difficult to overestimate the epochal creation from the famous director Ridley Scott called ""Blade Runner"". This is now a well-established fiction that has passed the test of time and over a long history has won the favor of viewers around the world, besides revealing the birth of a whole direction, which is now commonly called cyberpunk.Taking as a basis the well-known novel by Philip K. Dick ""Do androids dream of electroovtsy?"" Sir Ridley supplemented the work, substantially reworked it, breathing something new into his picture. This film was imbued with the atmosphere of the decline of the future, the dominance of various technological innovations, which at the same time, it seems to me, absolutely did not bring joy to people. Society vegetates in a monstrous world of consumption, where a person and his personality are lost among a large crowd. Scott perfectly conveys the atmosphere of an authentic future, playing superbly with dark tones, and tells his story through the prism of a society falling into decline.The genre that was born thanks to this picture is now recognized thanks to the noticeable features of this film. The world here is presented in the form of a night city with the presence of numerous bright neon colors, a lot of advertising signs, frequent rains. Here you will be met by futuristic, but angular cars that fly right in the clouds, corporations rule the world, and artificial people can meet among the inhabitants of the planet. They're replicants.The main character, played by Harrison Ford, will have to face a group of them. He is a representative of a special squad called Blade Runners, who are fighting the appearance of replicants on Earth,. And his mission is to find several dangerous representatives of artificial people in order to prevent their existence on our planet. Ford's hero named Rick Deckard will do this with special interest for observation. The script and direction of the project allow you to plunge into the authentic world of the night metropolis, which is as familiar to everyone living in it as it is just as dangerous for them.The film poses a lot of questions to the audience, the main one of which boils down to drawing a line between real people and artificial ones. The topic is not new and even popular for that time. But, like any author, Philip K. Dick and Ridley Scott, who filmed this book masterpiece, answer this question in their own way.What is the role of man in this world? And who are the replicants? The latter are the offspring of the former, but how different are they? Where is the line between them, because everyone has their own consciousness, memory, and, as I think, feelings. It will be difficult to answer, each viewer will decide for himself which verdict will be right for him.An important heroine, played by Sean Young, will help the viewer and the main character to understand this issue. Her Rachel is shrouded in mystery, she is a special heroine who allows you to better understand this world of people and replicants.The film is complex and viscous. You drown in it, it seems long and slow. However, now, it would seem, these losing moments have become the hallmark of the work. The general plans of a dark city, towering pillars of fire somewhere in the distance, electronic sad music, like the sounds of loneliness of everyone and everyone in this huge metropolis - all this conveys the atmosphere of Scott's work.For this world, as if such wonderful actors as Rutger Hauer, Harrison Ford, Sean Young, Daryl Hannah, Bryon James and others appeared to the world as a selection. A great hit for everyone, the creation of unique and memorable characters.The picture will definitely make you think about the place of a person in the modern world and the future world of the future. Who will live next to us, how will we treat them, will the new artificial creatures pose a threat to people? There are a lot of questions that are quite difficult to answer.But I will never forget that monologue of Rutger Hauer's hero in the finale, his tears in the rain: ""I saw things that you people never dreamed of. Attacking ships blazing over Orion; Si rays cutting through the darkness at the gates of Tannhauser. All these moments will be lost in time, like... tears in the rain... It's time to die.""It seems that this is the quintessence of the whole work, when not only Deckard will rethink the familiar reality, but the audience along with him.7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Excellent, no matter which version your watching","I think I've owned 3 different versions of this film at one time and can finally 'retire' my old versions after being dished the final cut alongside the versions I grew up with.To be fair, the first version I saw of this was on home video and included the now infamous voice overs and happy ending. I loved that version. Given, Harrison Ford's voice over sounds like he wasn't taking the ordeal too seriously, it unintentionally provided another layer for the movie.One of the things that stood out in Ridley Scott's vision of the future was how America was more than a melting pot, it was a blur of images of past, present, future and a blur of culture and ethnicity. In a word, it was a blur of identity. The voice-over, love it or hate it, always gave an almost non-time feel to the movie, combining old fashioned detective film noir to a gloomy, messy future. Looking back, many of the narrations feel silly, but it still added an additional layer to the film.Looking forward, the director's cut creates a different film. That idea of identity is further explored as the lack of narration makes Deckard's thoughts more ambiguous as his own identity is questioned. This version always created a sense of isolation and curiosity. Ridley Scott's vision seems more authentic.I always loved the non-CGI visual effects of the film, which still hold up to this day (if you don't believe that, then do not wait for the 5 disc DVD - rush to a city showing it on the big screen). In the early 80s, sci fi films were popular and while many were experimenting with new technologies, a lot of Blade Runner is old fashioned models, which blow away ANY CGI (note to George Lucas, Robert Zemekis and all cgi aficionados everywhere). The sets were great - the muddled future, looking like a New York Nightmare.But the simple story is what still stands out. Brushed off as a gloomy search and destroy pic in its original release, viewers now see the questions the film raises about humanity and identity, perhaps also raising eyebrows about how it all fits into science. The acting was always top notch, notably from Rutger Hauer who appears first as a classic villain but shows much more depth in his limited screen time. He's also got the best dialogue.Whatever version you watch of Blade Runner, you're always in for a classic. The vision of this film is unprecedented and something about it remains fresh 25 years on. If you haven't seen it - watch it now. If you have, watch it again. There's always something new to discover about this classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Quasi religious symbolism, pre CGI science fiction, excellent","I had to watch this film after trying to understand its sequel Blade Runner 2049 (2017). The film was released in 1982 but is based on a 1968 novel 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' Directed by Ridley Scott who brought the sci-fi film Alien to the big screen in 1979 it stars Harrison Ford as an cop Rick Deckard whose assignment is to hunt down and indeed retire 'replicants'. Human looking androids. Four have made it to earth and 2019 Los Angeles. So the film has visions of L. A. some thirty years into the future, around now at the time of viewing nearly (2017).Much like other films most notably Back To The Future II it envisages a world of hovering cars, neon, electronic advertising of big corporations like Piccadilly Circus and Times Square and a dark, rainy city. The art direction of the film is from an era when the dreaded CGI of the later Star Wars films hasn't arrived thankfully and makes full use of models and miniature effects.For anyone that has watched Alien you will know of the human looking android character. I suppose this film follows 'replicants' like that. Ford doesn't dominate the film. His co-stars include replicant Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) and Sean Young. The nail in the coffin for the screenplay was Deckard falling in love with one of the androids. I found the film hard going. I'm not sci-fi weary as I like the early Star Wars films and indeed the latest releases but the dark vision of 2019 is depressing. I don't understand how this film has gathered such a cult following over the years. Apparently there is some debate over whether Deckard himself is a replicant. It sounds very negative but I'm not particularly interested.The religious symbolism of the film reminded me of another I saw recently Mother! (2017). Here the Batty replicant played by Hauer pierces his hand with a nail like the crucifixion? One positive when compared to its sequel Blade Runner 2049 is the 117m or so running time compared to a near three hour run time for the sequel film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Great Sci-Fi Noir,"Some People see this film as overrated, and boring. To be honest, I can see where they are coming from. If you want to see a good review from someone who explains exactly why they don't like it, watch RedLetterMedia's Re:View of Blade Runner. I can see the criticisms, but to me the movie is a masterpiece, and in a way its flaws makes it a masterpiece. To me the general slow pace make the film immerse you into Los Angeles, and despite its obvious exaggerations, this future feels real. The slow pace also establishes the beauty of this modern world, established through impressive cinematography, Vangelis's great soundtrack and of course the special effects. This is by far one of the best looking films of all time, and personally that look is really able to draw me in where the film might bore others. Some argue the story and characters are what hold this film back, however I would disagree. No one argues that Rutger Hauer's performance is bad, but many have problems with Harrison Ford's Deckard. To me, he is a sad depressed man who drinks, and abuses women. It's more subtle, and we can see that Rachel in the film probably doesn't like him at all, but just needs to find refuge. The whole replicant/human discussion is definitely interesting, and I won't spoil anything for someone who hasn't seen the film so they discover the debate for themselves. Honestly I don't have a clear idea, the movie works either way, but I am still not sure. Hopefully 2049 doesn't answer the question for me. Blade Runner is one of the greatest sci fi films ever made, and to me it changed the face of cinema and sci fi films forever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Aesthetically powerful, slow philosophical Sci-Fi","This film imposes a difficult exercise for the critic. On one hand, it depicts powerful concepts, but on the other hand as a film lacks quite a bit in terms of pace and content. So basically put, its narrative is greater than its own self. The film is a much, much lesser effort than the themes it depicts.Young Harrison Ford does alright, while Hauer (the villain) is decent as well but so much of this film is in the things it hints at rather than the things it actually actively does. Just Hauer himself is more a compelling character on an aesthetic level really.The scenery is superb in places, really very impressive stuff visually for a 1982 production. But as so often with Ridley Scott sci-fi's, we're given a lot of arty stuff, of the rarest more sophisticated kind, along with very deep philosophical themes... but his films seem to always have that discrepancy in pacing and in actually developing those themes. This film borders on the genius in what it scratches on, but never achieves that genius because of how linear the scenes are, how excessively paced down the development occurs, and simply, how much the film focuses on all other things but those philosophical themes.If you'd catch that film at any random point and watch on, you'd never think it was anything more than one of those hot crime type scifi's from the 80's. It's only towards the end we're revealed all the depth that was supposedly hiding in this work. But it's too late by then. A film with such conceptual density needs to, while still maintaining subtlety in execution, make it clear what it's about. Instead, we're really given a succession of scenes with little actual value in themselves: a common, linear body of sequences with ordinary, underwhelming events happening. The fight scenes are long and often in bad taste, most scenes are in themselves totally forgettable, and what really is praised in this one is the narrative and philosophical implications from the very end, so not the film itself but what it talks about.So that's watching a full two hours of very ordinary, highly paced sci-fi, for just the one powerful scene at the end with the big quotes and all the poetry. It's totally underwhelming in light of what's put in the works. An artisan/craftsman needs to make his works shine and highlight its most precious qualities, not conceal or smother them while other aspects completely dominate the equation.As trivia, this is a film that's influenced the band Fear Factory enormously, the band quoting many moments like: ""I want more life - it's too bad she won't live... but then again who does - that's what it is to be slaved""... and one must pay tribute to the use of the then very modern synth-based atmospheric soundtrack and how it mixes so well with the blueish/metallic overtone on the visuals, with the rain at the end and that poetic, genuinely deep moment. ""Our memories, like tears in the rain"".As an ultimate philosophical ideal, this film is profoundly nihilistic. It's clearly saying man and machine are virtually the same thing so long as they are merely as intelligent, so long as they are sentient beings with memories. So no place for the soul, or a god. Organic=artificial, and there's no profound meaning to life.The other thing is this film has an interesting twist, but again, does little in the way of clarity there.A sympathy 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

A Stunning Vision of A Dystopian Future,"Taken from the novel DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP? by the late, great science fiction writer Phillip K. Dick, BLADE RUNNER must be ranked as one of, if not the, greatest visual achievements in the history of cinema. Directed by Ridley Scott (Alien), the story focuses on Los Angeles, 2019. A film-noir technopunk verisimilitude dominates in this time, as large blimps extoll the virtues of going ""off-world,"" while the majority of people live in pollution and towering pyramid buildings, where strobe lights of various hovercrafts wind across gothic stone gargoyles, where the sun never seems to rise and the torrents of rain never stop.  The culture of Los Angeles seems to naturally grow from our present time; there is a large Asian and Hispanic community and culture.  Deckard (played with a splendidly Marlowean low-key by Harrison Ford) is a ""Blade Runner""- cops specially trained to eliminate illegal off-world worker androids who run amok on earth.  The leader of the ""replicants,"" Roy (Rutger Hauer), seek only a chance to live beyond their pre-determined deaths.  As Deckard descends further and further into the hunt through the seedy streets, he also discovers a most unusual love interest-- a legal android (Sean Young) who refuses to believe her memories are fake. As mentioned before, BLADE RUNNER has a wonderfully unique vision of the future, created by visualist Syd Meier, that every science fiction film from RUNAWAY to THE FIFTH ELEMENT has ""borrowed,"" to put it nicely. However, what truly makes the story compelling is the quest for humanity, and what truly makes us human.  If at all possible, view the Director's Cut: the ending is completely different, more realistic, and ultimately more powerful.

From original release (1982) to directors cut (1991) to final cut (2007),"After a somewhat hesitant start at the box office ""Blade runner"" has become a real classic film. There is an original release (1982), a directors cut (1991) and a final cut (2007).The theme in ""Blade runner"" is the question if robots can develop (human) emotions. This question ia closely linked with the discipline of Artificial Intelligence, and so ""Blade runner"" shares this theme with the film ""AI"" (2001, Steven Spielberg).There are however nuances in the way the two films elaborate on the theme. In ""Blade runner"" the emotion in question is survival instinct. In ""AI"" the emotion in question is love. This distinction has several consequences. ""AI"" is not only about the question if robots can love humans, but also if the other way round is possible. Because the robots in ""AI"" have a social function they have a different look from the robots in ""Blade runner"", which are more like production robots.In a broader sense there are more films that search for the characteristic element that makes human beings human. Often the answer is ""emotions"", such as in ""Invasion of the body snatchers"" (1956, Don Siegel) and ""Wings of desire (1987, Wim Wenders). In the first mentioned film angels are looking for human emotions, in the other film human beings are afraid to lose their emotions.It must be said however that ""emotions"" are a broad concept. We already came across meanings as ""survival instinct"" (""Blade runner"") and ""love"" (""AI""). In ""Wings of desire"" emotions are also used in the sense of ""love"", but in ""Invasion of the body snatchers"" we are talking about ""irrationality"".Earlier in this review I wrote about the robots in ""Blade runner"" being a kind of production robots. This points to another (sub)theme, being a society divided in the happy few (who consume) and the suppressed masses (who produce). In a film such as ""Metropolis"" (1927, Fritz Lang) the supressed masses are humans, in ""Blade runner"" they are robots.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Let's face it, aside from nostalgia, this is nowhere near an 8/10","When Blade Runner first came out, it was a complete office bomb for a reason. Later it developed a cult following and much of the current high rating came from there since IMDb did not exist in 1982. For that I think this score is ridiculously bloated because most reviewers are die hard fans.The premise of the film is great and it is the first of its kind focus on a futuristic dystopia. It is the model that set forth future films either of the complete same genre such as Ghost in a Shell, The Fifth Element, etc... or influenced their vision of an overcrowded future cityscape such as Star Wars Prequels.The problem with the film itself was the execution. It couldn't decide whether to be an action genre or one of those deep philosophical ones. The plot dragged and was not really well planned out. The visuals were a mix for me. Some of them, especially the flying scenes were amazing. However, the street views were a bit too dark to see and way too messy to often make out what was going on.The music is also a mix. At times it was spot on, while other times it is too loud and didn't quite fit the scene. All of this was rectified in the sequel 2049, which is more of a masterpiece and improvement upon this version.The story line also couldn't decide whether to dev more into the lore or focused on the ""awkward"" romance between Deckard and Rachel.Anyways, overall it balances out as a 5/10 for me. To be honest, I think you can just watch 2049 without watching this one. 2049 has everything you like in this one, but improved, cleaned up, and just overall a much better experience.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Blade Runner stands the test of time,"This is one of the very few movies that gets better the more often you see it. It is a subtle movie. Slowly but surely this one has made it into the top 5 of my 'best movies of all time' list.I don't particularly care for the director's cut version, though. The inner monologue is missing - which gives you some of the most thought inspiring moments, and some of the added scenes downright make no sense at all. If I'd seen that one first I might never have given it a second chance.The cast is exceptional. Every one of them does a really fine job. Especially Rutger Hauer who otherwise has very few good movies to his name (maybe 'Day of the Falcon') delivers a stunning performance. Most of the cast who were unknown before this movie have moved on to fame (and some to fortune) - and rightfully so.From a technical point of view there is not much to criticize. More than 20 years later this movie still doesn't look dated (apart from 'Atari'-neon signs). The atmosphere is created with a lot of attention to detail, and the models of buildings are some of the most beautiful and believable ones I have ever seen.Now I recently read the book on which it is based ('Do androids dream of electric sheep' by Philip K. Dick). It's a quirky read and, frankly, not a very good book. It has too many plot holes, deus-ex-machina devices and logical inconsistencies, plus a total letdown of an ending. What it does add to the movie is the setup of why the atmosphere is like it is (polluted, dark, many 'freaks' around), and the nice question whether the Hero might be a replicant himself.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Simply the Greatest Film Ever Made,"Blade Runner is my favourite film of all time. I first saw it 20 years ago and I still see something new everytime I see it.This is a thinking mans film. You cannot understand it in one nights rental or 1 viewing.

I could analyse it all night, but if I mentioned the music by Vangelis,the oriental music as the children ride through the streets on their bikes, the photo that Deckard looks at of Rachels family that suddenly comes alive and you hear the sound of laughter and better times, the moving speech by Roy as he declares Its Time to Die... , those lucky enough to see the film will now what I mean about its constant ability to generate a wide array of deep emotions.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

...uh...?,"Wow, that was one of the most insane movies I have ever seen in my entire life. Luckily, I'm the guy who absolutely loves stuff like that. What I found weird about this was how there were all these unrelated stories being shown one after another. It was indeed great to see them all connect at the end. It was just hard to keep up with how they kept changing from one to the next. Anyway, this was still an absolutely wonderful film. It's mostly because it's such a beautiful looking movie. I simply can't believe this was made in 1982. I mean with these great visuals, it looks more like it was made in the 2000s!They mention 2017 as a date at one point and it's weird to be reviewing this in that year. My dad was right. This really was a movie that just puts you in a whole new world. It's hard to comprehend what's going on because everything is just so ridiculous. It's pretty easy to say it was dreamlike. I mean, this literally seems like a dream I would have. I guess dreams are something we can all relate to. It was about as easy to follow as one! I thought that it would be like an overblown action movie at first. Instead, there wasn't that much action and it instead just let its beautiful sets tell the story.I really do feel myself sympathizing and caring for the characters even though it was really hard for me to follow. I am so glad that there was an opening scene that told us all that was going on. I'll never get over how wonderful this movie looks for being made in the early 1980's. I guess this was just a thing for Harrison Ford back then as it was the same time the original ""Star Wars"" movies were made. While this wasn't as good as those, it was just a visual masterpiece you couldn't help but get lost in its world. The pacing is just amazing, with so much being set up at the right time.

Comments on Director's Cut,"Ridley Scott's horrific future-vision of Alien was a landmark in cinema. Blade Runner keeps his trademark bleak city vision and opens it up with questions of existences in a detective thriller.  The Director's Cut adds a whole new element that many people suspected from the original but makes it clear that this is what we're meant to think.The visuals and the score in the film are excellent and for me make the whole thing work.  Ford and Penn are good in their roles, but Rutgar Hower is excellent as the lead android making this one of his best performances - who doesn't know his final speech almost verbatim by now?!  Ford's wooden style fits in well with the cold city that he lives in and also lends itself to the fact that Ford may not be everything he seems.This is the version that we should have seen years ago - it allows us to follow the story ourselves without the voiceover having to lead us by the hand.  The main addition of Ford's unicorn dreams opens up a whole new element to the film and throws up plenty to talk about once it is finished. A beautiful looking film that, thanks to this cut, has plenty of substance to match the visual flair.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Ridley Scott's vision and skill in filmmaking is outstanding. Character development is phenomenal, but most of all the special effects shine brighter than any film made in its time. The performance of Rutger Hauer as Roy Batty was the best of his career. Why this film never got the recognition at the time of release is beyond me.

"Interesting, but I'm still not sure if it's all that and a bag of potato chips","I have heard quite a bit about Blade Runner lately, from a friend, on TV, my movie book, and my mom, so I wanted to see what all the fuss was about, so I rented it and just watched it tonite and I have to say that this was a very strange and disturbingly beautiful film. My only problem with it, is that it was just the more expensive Terminator in some ways. But I did enjoy the story, despite how weird it was, it is a film I haven't really seen. I loved the effects, it just amazes me how realistic they were compared to today's technology, not to mention the moral of the story still needs to be recognized in today's society.In the year 2019, we have created a type of machine, looks and acts like a human, only they are stronger and smarter, they are called Replicants. But due to a violent act they are forbidden from entering planet Earth; 4 replicants have made it to Earth and want their lives expanded from 4 years to so many more. Rick Deckard, a retired Blade Runner, rejoins the force to stop these replicants, but ends up realizing who might be the true enemy.It's very interesting and very visually stunning, but I wasn't incredibly impressed, at least with all the hype I heard with it. I can understand why, because it was a huge break through for the time, but still for me, I enjoy the Terminator films when it comes to a futuristic robot film.

Masterpiece with perfect flaws,"Blade Runner is a 1982 sci-fi, noir film directed by Ridley Scott, starring Harrison Ford, Sean Young and Rutger Hauer. The film was written by Hampton Fancher and David Peopless. The film is based on Phillid K. Dicks novel: Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? There exists multiple cuts of the film, the most prominent being the theatrical cut, the director's cut and the final cut, which is the version i will be reviewing. We follow Blade Runner, Rick Deckard who is assigned to to ""retire"" 4 Replicants on Earth. The film is set in future Los Angeles where the replicants try to find there maker: Dr. Eldon Tyrell. Deckard now has to find the replicants in the polluted City before they can get to Dr. Tyrell. When i first saw Blade Runner i was quite disappointed, i thought the pacing was awful and the chemistry between Young and Ford was non-existing. However, after my second and third viewing something changed. It was also surprising to me that i was drawn back to the film again after the first viewing. I simply couldn't get Blade Runner out of my head and after the third viewing it became one of, if not my favorite film of all time. I began to take notice of all the small details that Ridley Scott put in the film. I discover something new every time i see the film. What also made me love Blade Runner is all the ways it can be interpreted. The themes of what it means to be human and life are strong themes, treated with such complexity through the visuals. What has been said a million times is that this is a beautiful film. I would say it's probably the most beautiful film i've ever seen. The film contains the best miniature work since Star Wars. The performances are a little mixed. Rutger Hauer gives in my opinion the best performance in the film. Ford gives a decent performance, Ford didn't really enjoy the shoot and Worning with Scott and he does come off as uninterested in some scenes, but i think it works for the film. It is a film noir and for that reason Fords' cold performance works. He really reminds you of the classic Humprey Bogart detective. It's Sean Youngs first film role, but she gives a decent performance. I've already talked about the visuals, but another standout feature of the film is it's music. The score by Vangelis is very unique and fits the film perfectly. The atmosphere of the film is enhanced to perfection by the score. For the above mentioned reasons i consider Blade Runner to be one of the best films of all time. You can enjoy the film for the visuals alone, but If you pay close attention you will discover a very deep and thought provoking sci-fi film. Final rating: 10/10⭐️",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"It's not what you expect, but it's still brilliant","I get the feeling that a lot of people watch Blade Runner expecting it to be a sci-fi action thriller in the vein of Star Wars, or at least be more action-oriented than it is. But, even though it's visceral and different, Blade Runner is a classic once you get past the disappointment at the lack of laser fights.Taking after Philip K. Dick's novel, Blade Runner is more of a commentary on the role of technology in society. And the depths and lengths to which it goes to explore the issue are incredible. It's a film with layered characters, dialogue laden with undertone and a whole lot of metaphor and motif.Harrison Ford has found his own in another role seemingly written for him. He plays the disenchanted protagonist excellently (a la Star Wars and Indiana Jones), and this time is met with a wonderful opposite in Rutger Hauer's Roy, an antagonist whose morality and motives are put into question right until the end of the film. It's one of those stories that offers more questions than it does answers, leaving you pondering what it all meant and what happens next.I always enjoy a film that leaves its thematic question open to interpretation. Blade Runner never settles on who the ""good guy"" or the ""bad guy"" is, but instead poses you a question and leaves you to consider it for yourself.7 out of 10, definitely don't expect a space opera, and expect it to make you think.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

I noticed the use of the term ""retiring"" rather than dead. We couldn't say they are dead, that would make them feel too human. We have to make sure not to blur the lines too much, no matter how human they seem. After all they cannot be fully conscious, or can they? Could we take it that far?

The major drawback, in my opinion, was the slow pace of storytelling.The movie's themes, such as androids seeking free will, an android believing it is human, and the android's musings on life and death, have been explored in later films, which made the plot of this movie feel predictable and the character arcs less enjoyable.The futuristic world depicted in the movie was visually appealing, the actors did a great job, and the cinematography was impressive, but the overall color tone felt off to me. Additionally, the music in the movie was underwhelming and seemed almost nonexistent.In conclusion, watching this movie after seeing other sci-fi movies about androids that came after it dampened my enjoyment of it.

Sci-fi Noir,"When ""Blade Runner"" was released, it was not very successful at the box office, but some viewers recognized it for what it was--a stylish sci-fi noir. Harrison Ford plays the retired blade runner Rick Deckard, whose job is to eliminate rogue/illegal androids. A handful have escaped to Earth, so Deckard is drafted to end the threat.This film served as the blueprint for many dystopian films to follow. Director Ridley Scott's future Los Angeles is dark, oily, rain-soaked, and smoky. A blend of the old and the new are fused in the gritty Sino-American culture that is ground-level LA, far below the forbidding, soaring towers that house the powerful.The wonderful cast includes Sean Young, Rutger Hauer, Daryl Hannah, Joanna Cassidy, Edward James Olmos, M. Emmet Walsh and William Sanderson. Their quirks and passions add a vibrancy that is lacking in their environment, though it is rich in detail.The pace of the film is leisurely, as if Scott wants the camera to linger over every facial expression, every moment, every ephemeral object. It takes us inside Deckard's vulnerabilities, down dark alleyways of decay, and even reveals the hidden reflections of a photograph.In the end, ""Blade Runner"" is a contemplation of mortality. Adapted from a novel by Philip K. Dick--a model for many other sci-fi films to follow--it immerses the viewer in an alternate world that feels both real and unreal, and cleverly asks more questions than it answers.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The film also affected me intellectually, and left many unaswered questions, that I still cannot manage to find the answers to. ""Was Deckard REALLY a replicant?"" is the most haunting of all.

"Inspired by the cliffs-notes of a great novel, Blade Runner is, unfortunately, not widely recognized as a fecal insult to literature","Blade Runner is perhaps the worst film adaption of a novel ever made. To say that Blade Runner is an adaption of Phillip K Dick's inspiring novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" is not only a lie, but it is an insult to both Phillip K. Dick and any movie that has been adapted to film with even a marginal degree of success. It is most generous and honest to say that Blade Runner is inspired by ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"".Blade Runner presents, at best, a surface-level representation of a select few of the novel's characters; these representations are devoid of the depth that made them captivating. Likewise, there are many great (and well-developed) characters who were excluded from the film.The subplots, entire segments of the plot, the greater part of its ethos, and major aspects of the novel's theme are also expunged from this film. In short, the elements of the novel that have moral, narrative, effusive, or dramatic merit are conspicuously absent from this film.Instead of being a narrative that re-affirms greater truths about humanity, Blade Runner exists only as a testament to sloppy adaptation by screenwriters who have such little respect for literature that they would cinematically re-hash a novel's spark notes.I believe that, were the novel by which Blade Runner is inspired more widely read, society would recognize Blade Runner as the fecal insult to great literature that it is.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
An excellent genre mash-up,"I see Blade Runner as a hybrid of three different genres: sci-fi, art-house, and film noir.One thing I've long appreciated about sci-fi is that, at it's best, it provides a platform for a treatment of philosophical topics. The ""what makes us human?"" topic is a meaty one, and they give it the treatment it deserves in Blade Runner. The opening scenes with the Voight-Kampff tests are an excellent lead-in to this discussion as they challenge the viewer to ask themselves ""How would I react in these situations?"" That engagement with the viewer does a lot to draw them into the story. The vivid setting elements pull the viewer in even deeper.Art-house films are more of an acquired taste; they require some patience from the viewer. 2001 kind of set the example for art-house/sci-fi, and I think Blade Runner was following in it's wake. A lot of people badmouth Alien 3 for similar reasons. The big issue there, I think, was that audiences were expecting a sci-fi/action movie (like they got with Aliens (2)) and were served up a slower-paced, more arty, piece instead. Mismanaged expectations. Zardoz is another art-house/sci-fi film along these lines.Classic Noir films (e.g. 40s-50s era) are typified by bleak tones: people are trapped in unpleasant situations, the world around them is corrupt, and the characters typically drive toward a doomed fate. (The ""Private Eye giving a voice-over"" is also a hallmark of the noir genre.) I've typically described noir as ""part crime drama, part psychological thriller, part bittersweet romance."" Neo-noir builds on the genre and typically adds the following elements: identity crises, memory issues / subjectivity, and -- most importantly -- technological problems and their social ramifications. All of these things describe Blade Runner to a 'T'.﻿",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Greatest Science-fiction/Drama movie ever made.,"This film is definitely the greatest Science-fiction/Drama movie ever made. Ridley Scott has managed to create a movie (in conjunction with the story) that depicts the future of the world and technology in an outstanding manner whereby an environment of solitude and closure is created amongst an influx of over-population and overwhelming advertising and entrepreneurial/urban development.The feeling of darkness and bleak desolation is beautifully conveyed as a result of the wonderful directing, and the musical undertones create the ultimate balance between surrealism and fiction.Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer both give great performances, but the movie in itself works so well that no matter who played those roles, this movie would have been a success anyway.In my opinion, this is really what movies are all about. It gives a fantastic account of what the director is trying to show us through the storyline while leaving the viewer mesmerized and captivated by what he/she has seen, and at the same time questioning the future and its implications.This is an exceptionally original movie and one that will remain a classic for millions of other movies to come.

Beyond the special effects...there's not as much as you'd like. Harrison Ford is good as a character you can't feel much for, but he nonetheless does a good job. There's not point in wasting words on giving the plot, there's far too little space to effectively give it away.

"Looking forward to the New Directors Cut, but ...","... actually I have to admit that I also love the first one with Harrison Fords Voice Over !I don't mind the Marlowe-/Chandler-element and I think Ford hits a""wonderfull cliché-filled worn-out Noir-style"",even if the explanatory commentary was ""forced"" upon Ford & Ridley Scott (Or not ?).I think people should see the ""pop""-edition before the ""Director's Cut"" (which is now being re-cut from the beginning by Ridley for release in 2007) because this ""voice-over""-edition made a lot of the world realize that ScienceFiction is a way of telling essential stories, though maybe not the so-called cultural ""elite"" !And the Directors Cut - 10 years later in 1992 - came too late for the masses; who by now, felt that the story of another successful SciFi-movie-masterpiece *) : ""The Lawnmower Man"" (becoming the Cyber God) was getting just as close to the human mind and as personal as the PC (Personal Computer)!*)= Inspired by ""Flowers for Algernon""Of course I adore, love & respect the philosophical dramas of ""2001"" and ""Solaris"" laying the path to the moral Startrek-universe as well as the true pop-phenomenon of StarWars; BUT I remember the effect the voice-over-edition (of BladeRunner) had on people. They couldn't shake it of, because this movie embodies what we sci-fi-READERS (and I read almost 100 % of the danish sci-fi-books around 1980) wants all NON-scifians to see :This genre is about YOU and how the elements of the universe interact with You - understood by knowledge in our minds - but felt strangely as a reality in Your heart.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

As close to a perfect movie as there ever will be,"I'm going to go out on a limb and say that Blade Runner is a work of art as important as The Mona Lisa or Picasso's Guernica. It asks the fundamental question of our lives...... what is it to be a human? What does being human really mean? Which is ironic, as the film's non human has the most poetic and heroic way of dying, even as his ""humanity"" outshines all the other humans. He shows that he has learned empathy, forgiveness and compassion.Philip Dick was a genius, and an amazing writer. His novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep was the model for Blade Runner, and while the film made major changes in Dick's story, it somehow, as if by magic or fate, is even greater than the book. The mystery is how that could happen? His main characters of Detective Deckard and Rachel are not like the book's, but they are also much more than the book's characters.There are a lot of changes in the way the book and movie play out and end. Entire major scenes and characters from the book are left out or only hinted at, yet the story as filmed, is nothing short of a masterpiece. The mood it presents us is one of darkness with little light. Even though great violence is shown, they somehow turned things into a classic love story in the end, something the book didn't even attempt.Needless to say, the casting, acting, directing and cinematography are all 10 out of 10.

A masterpiece.,"Blade Runner is considered one of the greatest science fiction films ever made and it is easy to see why. Deeply thematic, rich characters, a fantastic script and nuanced performances toppled with some of the greatest cinematography ever put on film this is a film version of the mona lisa- every frame can be hung on a wall. Ridley Scott, fresh off the success of Alien is in top form and Blade Runner will be the film he will always be remembered for. Harrison Ford is competent as Deckard and anyone expecting him to be the usual dashing hero will be disappointed. Rutger Hauer steals the show as head replicant Roy Batty. The noir look of the film has inspired so many movies and video games since there isn't really a point talking about it- you have to see it to believe it. One of the greatest films ever made.

A classic.... but then so is Mary Poppins,"Not that I try to draw comparison with the two films, mind.OK. Fact is, when you watch the film later in life its really not as good as you remember. Sure it looks spectacular, even by todays standards and production value shows in every shot. But the actual plot, portrayal of emotions and script do leave certain aspects to be desired.Lets take for example, how does a man who is so obviously sensitive to the world get a job essentially killing ('artificial') people. It seems to so contrast with his character. In an early scene he voices (albiet in the over dubbed version) criticism of a police man being racist (the 'skin jobs' comment). Yet we are talking about a man who executes them. Surely I'm the only person to find this rather odd.But am I nitpicking? Its more of a visual film than truly philosophical and the added 'noir talk over' does nothing but simplify the action for the easy viewing audience.At least the 'directors' cut went someway to rectify the faults. No happy ending shot (to open car on a strangely clean and pollution free country road....). Plus the re-introduction of the idea that Rick Dekkard is a replicant himself, via the vehicle of the unicorn as dream content, metaphor, and finally, modeled in silver paper.Having said that, the book wasn't terrific either. So what can you say?Over rated? Yes.But still not a bad film in any sense of the word.The problem is that Science Fiction as a genre has been so badly served by its movie incarnations that people clutch at the better ones and escalate their worth. In my mind, that one truly superb Science fiction film has yet to be made.Somebody add some thought provoking script to the visuals of Blade Runner and run the film at the speed of ""The Matrix"" and then we'll be talking.One last rant. In the voice over version he say ""Sushi, that's why my wife calls me. Cold fish"".Only problem is that Sushi means 'seasoned rice dish' or just 'rise dish'. It's Sashimi that's actually cold fish.

One of the top Sci Fi films of all time.,"After watching the sequel to this film - went back to watch the original again just to wash the bad taste off of my palate. Denis Villeneuve directed the sequel as well as ""The Arrival"" - which is somehow even worse than the Blade Runner sequel - it was insulting to watch. Willing to bet that many of the people who left the poor reviews for the original Blade Runner - went on to watch the sequel and say it was great. Casting Gosling to lead that film pretty much destroyed it right out of the box. The only thing that could of been worse would of been to put DiCaprio in the lead - which makes me even more nauseous. If they make another sequel - I wouldn't watch it if it was the last new movie to ever be made.Anyone who requires needs an explanation as to why this film is superior.- is beyond help. This film is not Star Wars, Avengers or Alien. It is NOT a story regarding flying about in space ships and chasing aliens and interacting with comical robots. This story is about relationships and was very well crafted.The technical aspects of this film, the music, photography, story line, acting, etc. make it a science fiction classic that will never be reproduced.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

R.Scott's Masterpiece,"I.m a huge fan of R.Scott's work, i've watched Blade Runner in 82 and almost every year since...like yesterday evening :)In 79 R. Scott had made Alien the 8th passenger to compete against Star Wars for Fox, both changed Sci-fi movie forever, then he gave us Blade Runner and for me it's his masterpiece.It's a noir movie, a disappointed cop is hired by the L A metro police in a near future to kill replicant, human AI.It's raining all the time, no sky, it's really dark, down town LA is a mix of a open market for anything,animals clones and genetics shops, cheap hotels and squats, skyscrapers are huge, the Tyrel corp. looks like a modern over sized pyramid, most of the human beings who are always there, have diseases or have no money and cannot go to the space colonies.then i must say, the movie is really far better than the book 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' was.Harrison Ford is superb as all the cast. which is, for some of them, their best movie as of today, I became a fan of Rutger Hauer as well for his portrayal of Roy. do you know that, Roy's last words were a total improvisation of R.Hauer?the music by Vangelis is perfect. after all these years, it's still one of the best sci-fi movie ever made,you must see it",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Painful to watch,"This movie is extremely slow! I could appreciate that if there was some great story telling going on. However it's not really clear what the hell is going on.Harrison Ford is just walking around looking confused. Shoots a lady that I think was a robot, then he practically raped another robot after she saved his life. You see the antagonist only twice in the first hour of the film. He goes to his creator asking for more life since the replicates only live for 4 years, then he kills him. Seems counter productive to me. Ford's character has another run in with the other lady bot and that was honestly laughable. What the hell was that? Then the showdown with the main antagonist, again laughable. I really was expecting so much more from this film. But I find it really hard to watch.I feel like everyone giving this movie high ratings is clinging to older styles of film making and trying to make this some philosophical masterpiece but I just don't see it. Then there are those saying this is so good because it doesn't use special effects and recent sci fi movies are full of bad cgi. There are plenty of sci-fi film's that have way better story lines and make you ponder life regardless of good or bad cgi. And how does a film not using cgi or special effects automatically make it a good film? This whole story is just blah. I'm really so confused why this has such a high rating. It's in my opinion very tough to watch. I feel like they could have done so much more with this film. Don't get me wrong it is visually appealing especially for being made in the early 80's but that's about the extent of the pros with this movie.I'm watching this movie because I wanted some background before I watch Blade Runner 2049, I just hope the story telling and pacing are better than this one.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

I can acknowledge the many flaws in this film, but I can look past them to see a film that is a poetic and beautiful film.

Release version was better,"After seeing this movie over 10 times (over the years) I have to say that the 'directors cut' does not hold up to the stand of time when compared to the actual 'first release' version.The release version had the classic 'detective voice over' which really added A LOT to the plot and the depth of the characters.I moved my rating down from '9' to '8' for this reason. As time goes on and movies evolve we tend to demand better quality.Unlike Casablanca, Blade Runner has become shallower over the years. Still a good movie, its just no longer 'that good' of a movie.In general I find that directors who leave open key themes in the plot deliver a more shallow product. Weaving the threads of each theme in a plot together to form a composite whole is what a voice over does.Ultimately the play between good and evil for a cop/detective/centurion is a timeless story about individual response to evils of socially engineered injustice (intended or unintentional).I would like to see a re-release of the movie with the original voice over.

"Visually great, but incredibly boring","The movie looks like a comic book come to life.  But as far as a good impression goes, it doesn't go beyond the visuals.  Ridley Scott should've placed more emphasis on making the story more entertaining.  One thing I did think was wonderful about this film is the opening scene--a view of the future Los Angeles at night, with its skyscrapers and flying vehicles. Nonetheless, this movie is slow-moving and very boring; this is the type of film to watch if you ever have trouble sleeping at night and you need something to make you fall asleep quickly!",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Visually appealing; narratively challenging and with an eye on many-a film making aspects makes Blade Runner somewhat of a success.,"Blade Runner will eventually see its two lead characters, or its protagonist and his ultimate goal in tracking something down in the form of another character, share a memorable scene on a roof top of a distant Los Angeles, far into the future. After all of what's gone on and after all the venturing and the talking and the process of investigation, it boils down to one 'evil' character, who's a machine, and one 'just' character, a human-being, interacting; at which point we realise the human-being was a genre archetype and a plain old character following orders given to him by a larger force whereas the robot was a wandering, free spirit whom dared to dream and craved more out of life. The human comes across as more machine-like than the machine, with the machine coming across as more emotional and feeling-filled than the member of the human species. Such is the richness of Blade Runner that tn a lesser film, this exchange wouldn't have taken place and the character of Roy might've been a homicidal robot with a mindless agenda.Born into a slavery; used and then put through a grinder of negative emotions, Roy revolts and breaks out, consequently freeing himself and allowing himself the ability to explore things at his own pace, opening up his mind and allowing him to explore; learn; love and want to harm those that destroyed what he loved after being an assistant to the system. Blade Runner is like that, an eye on spectacle and scope for its location just as much as it has a spot of affection for its characters in what they think, feel and desire; if indeed they're even interested in anything more than grey trench-coats; glum expressions and order following .The lead is a certain ex-police officer named Rick Deckard (Ford), a man occupying a glum and gloomy, rain-sodden Los Angeles in 2019; a man of whom trudges through damp, wet streets with many others in a doomy looking; steamy and enclosed Chinatown area as large blimps hover above the mere mortals scrambling around in their squaller advertising breaks away to more tropical, more Utopian places. Director Ridley Scott opens his film with an establishing shot of the entire city, flying cars and the impressive canopy layer of some skyscrapers capturing the beauty and sheer awe within as an accompanying instrumental musical track emphasises both these traits. This is interestingly interjecting with random bursts of flames from vents of some kind, the likes that instill sudden senses of danger and risk of harm; perfectly capturing the world he's about to take us into as the camera very slowly creeps towards the city.The film gives its lead, Deckard, a mission in the grand tradition of noir in the sense it is his job to find something for someone. In days of old; be it The Maltese Falcon or Murder, My Sweet; noir leads have usually looked for an item or a person. Blade Runner, in all its hybridising glory, has fun with this particular premise in having its lead look for a sort of combination of both: a man/machine hybrid named a Replicant. The chief Replicants in the story, who've gone rouge and are seeking an extension of life, are Pris (Hannah), the film's femme fatale archetype whose birthday the film teasingly places on Valentine's Day; Zhora (Cassidy); Leon Kowalski (James) and the somewhat deranged and equally disturbing in his persistent state of calmness, Roy Batty (Hauer).Scott gets across a sense of futuristic scope in the film by setting a sequence at the slimiest, seediest and nastiest of run down night spots than you can, but a place that actually comes with advanced video phone technology in the back, suggesting that a sense of technological advancement has reached even these sorts of God-forsaken places. The film's meshing of classical noir with more contemporary science fiction is a given; but the film's hybridising of genres is perhaps best highlighted in a scene involving two characters, a toy manufacturer named Seb (Sanderson) and the aforementioned Pris, whom walk down a hallway of an apartment block towards Seb's home. Lights from outside systematically light up and make dimmer again the hallway, in doing so, casting expressionistic shadows across the walls and floors rendering the location one of both horror and noir as this strange looking woman with an agenda attempts to infiltrate her way in. The sequence is given an added sense of horror when we enter the man's apartment and observe the uncanny array of odd looking moving toys he has made over the years. This strange imagery combines with Pris' overall look in creating something quite terrifying, something the film acknowledges when it has Pris disguise herself as one of these toys later on in another sequence, suggesting a certain 'at one-ness' she shares with the items. The lighting lights the location the whole time with sudden glares and then total darkness, suggesting a sense of light or life that'll shortly come to an end, like an average house light strobing before it dies out.The film places Deckard on a strand of the detective ilk, he visits places and garners clues to everything which along the way leads him to the character of Rachel (Young), but the film is not an exercise in narrative as much as it is an exercise in technicality and mise-en-scene. Its grim view on man and machine being unable to co-exist in a world full of modernity and technological advancements is highlighted in an early scene involving Leon and a test of some description, as well as later on when Roy essentially kills off his creator, is counter-balanced with Deckard's ability to connect with Replicant Rachel. Blade Runner is an interesting film; a wonderful combining of a maker with a keen eye on the visual and love for one or more genres with complex items and ideas explored accordingly.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Beautiful Masterpiece,"Blade Runner is a prime example of how visionary and brilliant Ridley Scott can be when he tries. The film mixes extraordinary (well, for 1982) visual effects, great acting and a genuinely original and deep plot about what it means to be human.The plot, on a base level, concerns the exploits of ""Blade Runner"" Deckard as he hunts down rogue Reploids; advanced human-like androids that have a four-year lifespan to compensate for their other advantages. The rogue group, lead by Roy Batty, is looking to extend their aforementioned lifespans. This is really only a simple interpretation. The film is really about what it means to be a human being, especially when the reploids seem to demonstrate more humanity than the humans.Visually, the film looked in incredible in 1982, and still looks pretty good today. It's not just the backgrounds, but the incredible sets and mise en scene that truly bring the film to life in a way that makes it feel real. And as we approach 2019 (this review was written in Oct. 2018), the world of Blade Runner looks more and more eerily similar to our own.The performances in the film are just incredible. Harrison Ford as a depressing, inhumane drunk may not exactly sell itself, especially considering the types of roles he was known for playing at that point in time (i.e. charming rogue). However, Ford proves beyond all reasonable doubt that he can play his part, giving a stellar performance that allowed him to break free of the Han Solo typecast. But the real star of the show is Rutger Hauer, who gives a Shakespearean performance as Roy Batty.The soundtrack also deserves special mention for being varied and bizarre, and yet always managing to fit the scene perfectly.

"""The light that burns twice as bright lasts half as long""","On first viewing of Blade Runner most people will be left confused and probably a little disappointed. Even thought the studio had there way to some extent (cutting part of Scotts original vision in order to increase profits) this was not a film made to appeal to a mass market audience. Anyone looking for a generic action film with an obvious conclusion will be disappointed. For these reasons it did fail commercially on its first release in 1982.It could be best described as a film noir set in the future. Power hungry corporations harness control over a mixed race of neo-Tokyo lower-class citizens living in a decadent Los-Angeles slum. Enter Rick Decard a retired private eye who gets unwillingly hired to hunt down and eliminate a group of replicants who have escaped an off-world colony and arrived on earth to in order to extend their four year limited life span.Based on the Philip K. Dick novel ""Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep"", there are many existential themes running throughout and many questions purposely left unanswered so the viewer can come to his own conclusion. What is the nature of our existence? What does it mean to be human? Do we fully appreciate life? Are but a few.Everything about this film works. The cinematography is outstanding with every scene meticulously shot. The set and design are also stunning and still sets the standard for which every sci-fi film aspires too.The actors are also cast perfectly. Harrison Ford plays Rick Decard a man troubled by the demons of the past with seemingly no escape from his violent reality. Rutgar Hauer is Roy Batty the replicant leader haunted by his mortality, unable to find a cure. The supporting cast also put in memorable performances. A special mention to the futuristic, synthetic score by Vangelis that draws the viewer deeper into Scotts dystopian view of the future.

Blade Runner: The Final Cut,"* This comment was written following a theatrical screening of Ridley Scott's final cut of ""Blade Runner"" and is written about this newest version.Before I get started I must note that ""The Final Cut"" is a definitive cut of the film. This is the most cohesive, well-paced, and entertaining cut of the film, by FAR. I really hope Ridley Scott doesn't go do another cut because this one is as much as can be done without altering the script or filming new scenes.Another point I was thinking about during the film is how much of a 'theater movie' this is. I have seen the film in two forms (director's/theatrical) a total of three times, and though I always thought it was a good film, I never quite saw what all the fuss was about. A good, solid science fiction film was what I saw each time, but I had what felt like an epiphany during this viewing. The film is easily one of THE MOST GORGEOUS things I've ever seen. Brilliantly shot by Jordan Cronenweth (and I definitely give Ridley Scott some credit for how good this looks), the film is astoundingly beautiful and effective on the big screen. When watching it one realizes that each shot was painstakingly thought out, but unlike some others I've seen, the film is so fluid that you can't stop to think about such matters.One of several flaws I still believe ""Blade Runner"" suffers from is Vangelis' then ultra-modern score, which by today's standards is so dated it's distracting. That's not to say the film isn't well-scored, but synthesizer scores always bug me because they're bound to sound dated, and this is coming from a guy who loves 80's electronic music (the good stuff, not MTV). Another distracting aspect of the score was the bizarre combination of East Asian, Indian, and Arabic music which felt completely out of place and often forced. Since I'm criticizing the movie in this paragraph I'll throw in my opinion that the script was unbalanced in points, though drastically improved over the original 'voiceover included' version. I felt that dialogue could get distractingly forced at times.Still, during this viewing of ""Blade Runner: The Final Cut["" I noticed that the majority of criticism leveled at the film is a big load of rubbish. Technically speaking, there is basically nothing at all wrong with the film. Visual effects are excellent, photography and editing are accomplished, and the acting is phenomenal across the board, be it Ford, Hauer, Hannah, or Young, watching them was a pleasure.There is something the film communicates when seen on the big screen which is missing from home video viewings, and I'm not sure what it is. Is the film so visually dazzling that viewing it on a theater screen glosses over its numerous errors and some other minor flaws, or is it just that with Ridley Scott finally fully overseeing the final product the film has really improved as much as it did in my eyes? Whatever it was, ""Blade Runner: The Final Cut"" is an outstanding science fiction film, not without its flaws, but still one of the most effective films in the genre I've ever seen, and though it forsakes a lot of Phillip K. Dick's philosophical pondering to focus more on the pulp-ish if quite intelligent sci-fi/neo-noir aspect of ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"", the film stands so well on its own that I left the theater overwhelmed and feeling even a bit privileged to have had the chance to view this incredible film on the big screen and learn to appreciate it more.9/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Excellent opening, effects, and production design undercut by blah characters.","This film, much like 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY, has vexed me ever since childhood. I think one has to be over 40 to really appreciate what this movie has to offer, but it comes off as so narratively bland and straight-forward that I can't help but feel disappointed with every cut (and there are many).The opening couldn't be better. We get thrust into this dark horrible world of an overpopulated dystopian metropolis where it never seems to stop raining, advertisements bombard the populace, and flashing lights periodically invade every nook and cranny. The universe building and the special effects to accomplish it go off the chart in a way few other science fiction movies can achieve. On top of that, the world seems so realistic and lived-in that it's fascinating just to watch the people walk around and the cars float amongst the buildings.However, the plot lacks anything resembling a twist and just goes through the motions on autopilot. It's possibly a victim of the short story not supporting a full feature film, but even then there's a lot of good stuff in Philip K. Dick's original novella that got unfortunately cut. In some respects, I'll say that the recent late sequel works better as a narrative, but even that film has a lot of issues in other areas. For one, effects are no longer the awe inspiring show-stopper that they were back when this film was made.Blade Runner maintains some additional interest in that its villain and friends come off far more sympathetic than the hero. A lot gets left to the imagination, such as the fate of a few of the side characters. However, it spends too much time on the very dry relationship between a wooden Harrison Ford and a wooden Sean Young (though it works for her character). The two actually seem (from their tone and body language) to despise each other which doesn't really give us a lot to root for with them building a forbidden love. We also lose much sense of conflict with the hero ""sort of"" tasked with killing his own lover but he doesn't seem too pressured, either internally or from his superiors. It's an inhuman world but the movie needed a little more of a human heart to fully engage.A groundbreaking film in terms of world building and (like ALIEN and TERMINATOR) I'd love to see more films set in this universe, with the caveat that each film doesn't just follow the exact same formula as sequels tend to do.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
All he'd wanted were the same answers the rest of us want. Where did I come from? Where am I going? How long have I got?,"A masterpiece. It is one of the very few films that has left me stumbling out of the cinema, stunned.At face value, those who have no interest in the issues the film raises may see only a fantastic-looking, atmospheric sci-fi movie. It certainly is those things, but so much more besides.For me, it questions many of life's great imponderables in a way no other movie ever has. It is uncompromising in its vision of the frailty and deep flaws of mankind, and its uncertain future, and provides no easy answers, but when I saw it, it touched something deep inside that has stayed with me ever since.

"Beautiful, atmospheric, thought-provoking.","Based on a novel by Philip K. Dick, this futuristic urban Sci-Fi film is a masterpiece indeed. Director Ridley Scott has managed to turn Dick's story into a dark and complex film-noir styled mystery, that packs as much punch on an aesthetic level as it does on an emotional and substantial one. It's clear throughout the film that the movie makers' intentions was to make this more of an intelligent character study cum thought-provoking drama rather than the thrill seeking movie that the Sci-Fi genre movies usually are. This is shown by the way that the action in the movie is kept down to a bare minimum, and the way that the film always seems to want to put forward an idea rather than an action sequence. The plot, which covers themes such as what it takes to be considered alive, follows a group of four androids (""Replicants"") that have escaped their masters and come to Earth, where Replicants are illegal. Their intention is to seek out 'the maker' and try to add to their maximum four-year lifespan, given to them to ensure that they wont have sufficient time to develop emotions. On their tail is Deckard; a policeman in the business of hunting Replicants; known as a Blade Runner.Through a grim setting and dark characterization; Ridley Scott has truly succeeded in giving Blade Runner a classic film-noir style. This bodes well with the futuristic metropolitan version of Los Angeles that the film takes place in. Both of these elements blend excellently with the characters, which are intriguing as they are dark. Harrison Ford steps into the role of Deckard; the classic noir protagonist. We never really delve into his character; but at the same time, that ensures that the mystery surrounding him is kept up, which serves in making our protagonist all the more intriguing. Rutger Hauer, who gives a career-best performance as the leader of the Replicants, matches him. Hauer treads the line between pathos and pure evil brilliantly, and it's always easy to believe that he is the doomed android that the movie presents him as. The main thing I love about this movie is it's style; the dark Gothic undertones are superb to look at, and once the film enters it's final third, the atmosphere takes over and the way that it builds to it's beautiful and classic conclusion is absolutely superb. Blade Runner may have been met with negativity on it's release; but today it's an absolute classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Sci-fi Classic That May Bore You,"Blade Runner is a revolutionary Science Fiction film with visuals that still hold up decades after its release.

Are We This Cruel?,"I understand that things were done to the original film which I saw in a movie theater. It's been so long that I have no basis for comparison. Watching the Director's cut, I found it as engaging as I remember. It's sad when we have a hero who is basically a cold blooded murderer. The evil rest with ourselves. Can we really destroy a sentient being and have a moral justification. Once these replicants began to think for themselves, do we lose our right to them. Think of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein as Victor chases the monster across the ice. The creature cries out to him as his maker that he is part of him. These are seen as monsters, but they have no control over what they have become. Their memories are theirs, even though they were implanted. This is such a bleak view of our future and it plays very well in 2010. It is a feast for the eyes and is much better science fiction than most films made since. Ford's performance is intense and driven. This is an excellent film. I was curious why Leonard Maltin gave it one-and-a-half stars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
'They Don't Advertise For Killers In The Newspaper',"'Blade Runner' is one of those movies that offer so much that it requires and deserves repeated viewing. It is filled with allegory, allusion, other metaphors and so much philosophy. The writing is exceptional as the screenplay is layered and the dialogues are very philosophical. It's a fantastic film to discuss with others as it ends on an ambiguous note and there is a lot of symbolism that is open to interpretation. Perhaps I too will be editing my comment after viewing it again.On the technical side, it looks amazing. The dark dazzling world is eerily real. It also reminds one of noir classics. It does not have the stop motion that CGI's of today's movies have. I loved the technology that was used in 80's movies like 'Blade Runner', 'Starwars', 'The Dark Crystal' and 'Labyrinth'. They made their worlds more real to me. And when I revisit those movies today, it brings a nostalgic feeling as I remember how much I enjoyed these films. In the more recent movies, it's quite easy to tell which scenes were done with CGI as there is a lack of authentic look about it. Back to 'Blade Runner', the special effects and cinematography are mindblowing and how can anyone overlook Vangelis's powerful score? And what makes us appreciate them more is that none of them are over-the-top to the extent that they compromise the story.I haven't seen all of Ridley Scott's film but so far I'd say 'Blade Runner' is his best. His direction is solid. This wasn't an easy film to make and Scott deserves all the credit he's gotten. The cast is also interesting as it includes (then) not-so-famous actors. Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Edward James Olmos and Daryl Hannah all fit the bill.Today if one looks at these new science fiction wannabe movies, there's a sadness about how science fiction has progressed in Hollywood. Even now when very enjoyable brilliant films like 'Matrix' and 'X-men' are made, there are always sequels that completely destroy the essence of the first movie. But we will always have classics like 'Blade Runner' and 'Starwars' trilogy to revisit. 'Blade Runner' is a profound movie. It works on so many levels that it provides much more than pulp fiction entertainment.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Being a director meant something in the 80's,"Ahh, the 80's, when people could imagine the future as a dark, polluted thing, where people have lost their freedom to corporations. Of course, we now know that this would never happen. *cough*Philip K. Dick has a difficult writing style, something wild in it that makes it hard to grasp, to control. However a lot of his work molds well to the screen and Blade Runner is no exception. What makes the film exceptional, though, is not the pulp mystery feel of the story or the inspiration of the sets and clothes from mid 19th century US or even the excellent acting. Instead it is the attention to detail that Ridley Scott demonstrated when doing it all. This is clearly the work of an obsessive man who saw the film in his head way before it started to make it. This is rare nowadays due to budgets and to the fact that most of popular cinema is not an art anymore, only a business.Watch the film and notice how the characters are not really well defined, leaving room for the imagination, while the sets and the props are clearly very detailed and the world in which the story unfolds makes the characters both gain weight and lose focus. The human condition is actually the main character.Bottom line: a beautifully made film, by a dedicated director, with excellent acting and a story that works on multiple levels at the same time. Rightly considered a masterpiece, you should watch it at least once.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"The story and characters are a little thin, but it still contains many strong elements","Los Angeles 2019; a group of replicants have escaped from their own planet and are illegally residing on planet Earth. Their reasons for escape soon become clear as they are searching for the man that created them in order to extend their lifespan. It's up to former Blade Runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) to find the replicants and eliminate them as soon as possible...Blade Runner is a film that had been in my watchlist for a number of years, but I finally managed to sit down and watch it today. Although it's dubbed as a 'classic' and a 'science fiction masterpiece' I tried to blank these thoughts out and try to take it for what it is and on that basis I found it quite enjoyable...Granted the film is a little slow-paced and Harrison Ford's narration seems a little bit cheesy, but the fundamental aspects of the story are quite intriguing - fair enough there have been some copycat films that have followed Blade Runner (the recent Alex Garland film Ex Machina clearly owes some debt of gratitude to Blade Runner). I think the interesting thing about this film is that the replicants are painted in quite a negative light, but to be honest I did find myself having some empathy with their cause - they seemed to just want answers and weren't happy that they were only programmed to live for a total of 4 years. Yes the way they go about their business is questionable, but their cause is somewhat understandable.A couple of failings with this film lie not with the story, but more with how it is developed; the replicants are represented as being self-aware, but emotionless yet other than this we are given little insight into them as characters. A lot of what I've said in the last paragraph are based on my own suppositions and whilst I don't mind figuring out some things for myself in a film I do feel as though I should be given something to work with in the first place. The same can be said for Deckard and his relationship with Rachael - she's an experimental replicant who is capable of emotion through brain implants (presumably in an attempt to fool the Blade Runners), but again this relationship is glossed over and isn't really given the attention that it perhaps deserves - which in some ways taints the warm and fuzzy way that the film ends.Where the film does excel is in its visuals - it's a striking and beautiful looking film (it's actually scary watching this film now realising that it's only 1 year before it was set). Rutger Hauer is chilling as the leader of the replicants and his final showdown at the end with Harrison Ford was fantastic. A notable mention also should go to Darryl Hannah whose crazy assed antics made her fun to watch.Blade Runner's thinly developed story and characters are the only really glaring flaws and are the main reasons why I can't bring myself to love it as much as many other people do. That being said though, it still has a lot going for it and is a film that I would still recommend.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A Triumph of Style of Substance,"To say BLADE RUNNER is an incredible looking film is a gross understatement.The art direction--whether costume, scenic design, or special effects--is simply stunning, creating an extremely dark, sometimes beautiful, but always fascinating vision of a future Los Angeles that has begun to collapse into grotesque decay. Hardcore science fiction fans will instantly recognize that the city's spectacular highrises reference Fritz Lang's silent METROPOLIS; art history buffs should notice a distinct Frank Lloyd Wright tinge to some of the set designs; costume designs are clearly intended to evoke the spirit of 1940s film noir. The resulting melange is simply extraordinary, very powerful, and incredibly atmospheric.The cast gives able, stylish performances in keeping with the film's dark but glossy tone, but the script they play is a very muddy one. The story concerns a special agent (Harrison) who is assigned the task of locating and ""retiring"" (i.e. killing) a handful of violent androids who have illegally landed on earth. While I greatly admire the film's decidedly ""open-ended"" conclusion, I do not greatly admire the on-going vagueness that besets the storyline as a whole.We are persistently asked to ask believe that Harrison Ford locates his quarry via the vaguest information imaginable; moreover, although specifically described as a highly experienced and formidable agent, Ford's character gives little evidence of it: he's always being bashed around to the point of death and then overcoming his opponent more through dumb luck than superior skill. Most annoying of all, the film flirts with issues concerning creation of artificial life without actually amplifying any of them in a consistently engaging way.In spite of these failings, the performances and most particularly the incredibly compelling make BLADE RUNNER a fantastic triumph of style over substance. It is extremely enjoyable, and it is easy to understand how the film has drawn so many enthusiastic fans.The DVD presently available is a ""director's cut"" version and offers both widescreen and modified-for-television formats. The former is recommended, for the latter undercuts the visual fascination of the film. The picture quality of the widescreen format is superior; the sound is good but not exceptional. Aside from the choice of formats and brief biographies of the principal players, there are no extras of any kind.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Has the whole world gone mad?,"I consider myself somewhat of a movie buff, and several of my friends had highly recommended this movie to me. So a few other friends of mine (who'd also never seen it) and I watched it one night, and we very nearly turned it off. It was not the movie we were expecting, and we were certainly not pleasantly surprised. It was marketed to us as an action film, yet the actual action sequences were few, far between, and frankly rather boring, especially in contrast with Harrison Ford's usual daring escapades. I generally enjoy think pieces, but this one was an exception. I found the plot to be a bit hard to follow, and nothing about it made me want to put in the effort or the second viewing needed to fully comprehend what was happening. For example, the nudity was completely gratuitous, and Harrison Ford gave, in my opinion, the weakest performance of any movie I've seen him in. I don't want to give away the ending, as it seems that most people love this movie, but I felt it was not a good resolution to the story, and that in particular a speech given by one of the characters was trite and not nearly as life-changing as it thought it was.

At that age without the voice over the film would have been too difficult to follow, so i do have my reasons for liking that version.

"Good, but flawed (and dated)","(ATTENTION: SPOILERS) Blade Runner is a good film; I gave it 7/10. If I was around in 1982, I probably would have been blown away and thought it was the best thing I'd ever seen. But since I'm pretty young, I've been jaded by many other sci-fi masterpieces. I saw Blade Runner for the first time only a few years ago.Here are the positives: Brilliant cinematography, thought-provoking subject matter, great special effects (for 1982), a haunting score (the scene where Deckard shoots the chick replicant in the clear raincoat is seared in my memory), rich set design, and adequate acting.Here are some negatives: Very slow pace (yes, I have been too affected today's films), completely unbelievable scientific advancements (especially for 2019), and bad sound effects. I had a hard time buying into the whole interrogation of replicants. If they're man-made ""organisms,"" there has to be an easier way to distinguish them (maybe a DNA test or something). I also had a hard time believing that Deckard and Rachel were in love. That part of the story was lacking.Other films since Blade Runner (like Bicentennial Man and A.I.) have dealt with the same philosophical questions about the meaning of life and at what point does a ""robot"" become a person. I'm not saying that the two films I mentioned were better (cuz I'd get torn a new one) but I saw them before I saw Blade Runner and thus had already been exposed to the ""cyberpunk"" world and its philosophical questions.Anyway, that's my abridged opinion.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Not great,"When I first saw this film in the Eighties I remember not liking it, even though everyone I knew thought it was great. Seeing the ""Final Cut"" again reminds me that I was right. Not that there aren't great things in it: The production design of course is justifiably famous, the acting is first-rate (actually any cast that includes M Emmet Walsh, Brion James, and James Hong is pretty impressive,) and the score is terrific.A film is (or should be) more than a series of cool looking photos. It needs a compelling story. This story seems unfocused and unbalanced. For instance, early on there's a long sequence in which Deckard uses his detective skills to track down Zhora, but later, he is sent by his captain to the building where the remaining replicants are (conveniently) waiting. It seems like an entire reel is missing here.Also the ending is just uninteresting. On the FAQ page you can read the endings the screenwriters imagined. They're logical and dramatic. It's like Ridley Scott spent all his money on that cool blimp and billboards--and they are pretty cool--and he didn't have enough left over to film a proper ending. To me the ending is the most important part of any work. It's like in gymnastics. You can do a great routine, but the landing is the last thing the judges see.

Ridley Scott's follow up to the critical and commercial darling that was Alien, was by and large considered a flop and damned for not being a science fiction action blockbuster. There was of course some fans who recognised its many many strengths during the initial weeks of its 1982 release, but many who now claim to have loved it back then are surely looking sheepishly in the mirror these days, for the hard-core minority of 82 fans remember it very differently.Remember the spider that lived outside your window? Orange body, green legs. Watched her build a web all summer, then one day there's a big egg in it. The egg hatched...Anyway, that's by the by, the point being that a film can sometimes be ahead of its time, misunderstood or miss-marketed, Scott's masterpiece is one such case. Story, adapted in fashion from Philip K. Dick's story, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? Is pretty simple. It's a dystopian Los Angeles, 2019, and there are four genetically engineered Replicants - human in appearance - in the city, which is illegal. They were designed to work on off-world colonies, any Replicant who defies the rules will be retired by special police assassins known as Blade Runners, and Blade Runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is on this case. A case that will prove to have many layers...A new life awaits you in the Off-world colonies! A chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure!Ridley Scott gets to have all his cakes to eat here, managing to blend intriguing science fiction with film noir. That the visuals are outstanding is a given, even the film's most hardest critics grudgingly acknowledge this to be an eye popping piece of visual class - the mention of eyes is on purpose since it's forms a key narrative thread. That it is awash with eye orgasms has led to critics calling a charge of beauty over substance, but the deep themes at work here tickle the brain and gnaw away at the senses.Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? That's what it is to be a slave.Mood is set at perpetually bleak, a classic film noir trait, and paced accordingly. Scott isn't here to perk anyone up, he's here to ask questions whilst filtering his main characters through a prism of techno decay, of humanity questioned to the max, for a film so stunning in visuals, it's surprisingly nightmarish at its core. The emotional spine is ever present, troubled when violence shows its hand, but it's there posing an intriguing question as the Replicants kill because they want to live. And this as our antagonist, Deckard (Ford a brilliantly miserable Marlowe clone), starts to fall for Rachael (a sensually effective femme fatale portrayal), one of his retirement targets.Tears in the Rain.As Rutger Hauer (never better) saunters more prominently into the story as head Replicant Roy Batty, the pic evolves still more. Haunting lyricism starts pulsing away in conjunction with Vangelis' rib shaking techno score, while Jordan Cronenweth's cinematography brings Scott's masterful visions to life, key characters one and all. Visuals, aural splendour and dark thematics - so just what does it mean to be human? - Indeed, curl as one in a magnificent cinematic achievement. A number of cuts of the film are out there, and all of them have fans, but Scott's Final Cut is the one where he had total artistic control, and the scrub up job across the board is quite literally breath taking. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
WOnerdrful Riddley movie,"This is a film that is so deep, rich, and multi-layered, it may require more than one viewing to fully absorb the brilliance of what you've just seen. At first glance, it can be a bit slow. It's told in a classic film noir fashion, so this is to be expected. Director Ridley Scott seems to want to savor every shot, and an astute audience will be able to sense this.Now, I say the film is told in a classic Noir style, but this can be misleading. There is no Humphrey Bogart in Blade Runner, snapping off brilliant one-liners once a second. Only hopeless people, in many ways victims of the merciless world of which they are all a part. Deckard is a typically downbeat protagonist, a hard-boiled cynical leading man with a weakness for heavy drinking. The plot is a mystery in name only, as the audience is allowed to know what Roy Batty, Pris and Leon are all up to before Deckard ever finds out. This only lends to the dread and inevitability of the film, lending further to its pervasive gloom. There is no final scene at the end where the bold detective puts all the pieces together and says ""Ah-Ha!"". Instead, we find Rick Deckard questioning his own existence and drinking away his constant doubts, all the while embroiled in a romantic relationship with someone he's sworn to kill.Blade Runner requires audience participation, particularly in the Director's Cut, which is entirely devoid of some rather necessary exposition provided by the Original Cut's much-maligned voice-over. Certain facts will not be clear even at the end of the film, requiring personal interpretation in order to be appreciated fully. Other facts will be given away in much more subtle ways than in most modern cinema, such as through visual cues and tenuous dialogue.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Never been there. Never done that.,"I don't know why I spent so many years really disliking BLADE RUNNER.From the first time I saw it back in the summer of 1982 I disliked it. Maybe it was because I'd spent the previous year or so seeing trailers and ""making of"" segments that made it look so good that basically nothing could possibly live up to such expectations (and what could be better than ALIEN?)Then there were Deckard's square glasses (you can't drink well out of a square glass), all that tedious smoky light drifting through blinds, and that dove being released in slow motion to make us feel just sowhatever.I guess I do know why I spent so many years disliking it.Yet, slow motion dove notwithstanding, I find this new cut tremendously entertaining. I never imagined that more explicitly making Deckard a replicant could make it so much more fun. (Okay, here it is for the sceptics: Gaff's origami unicorn tells us he knows Deckard dreams of unicorns. He could only know this if said dreams were implants)Sure, it was always in the mix that Deckard was potentially a replicant. People suggested as much back in '82. The suspicion is alluded to in the movie – ""Have you ever tried taking that test yourself?""Now we know for sure. He's a robot and his memory is false. This makes almost everything about the early part of the film wonderfully weird. It opens up the possibility that when Deckard is brought into the police station and speaks with Bryant (M. Emmet Walsh), that this is the first time these two men have ever spoken!""I need the old magic,"" Bryant tells him. But there is no old magic. Deckard's complicated, perhaps tragic, in any case mysterious, personal history doesn't exist. Bryant has been told to speak to Deckard as if they'd known each other for years. By who? By higher ups. By people at the Tyrell Corp. maybe. In any case, it's made perfectly clear that replicants equipped with memory implants are a new model. Very new, like not even on the market yet. I know a lot of fans buy into the ""Deckard is a replicant"" reading, while at the same time wanting to imagine him as a grizzled old veteran cop, with years of experience under his belt. But I don't think you can have it both ways. If he is a replicant, he is necessarily new. Just off the assembly line, like Rachel must be.Similarly, when we see Deckard going into his apartment, after his visit to the Tyrell Corporation, this is the first time he has ever entered this apartment. He only knows his way around it, and who the people in his photographs are, because of the memory implants.Obviously, if you prefer, you can imagine Deckard as a week old replicant, or a month old replicant, but I don't know why you would. There'd be no point in having an expensive replicant drifting through the city reading the want ads for a few weeks, looking for a job his manufacturers know he'll never take.No. It's much more fascinatingly twisted to watch this character do for the first time things he thinks he's been doing for years. He gives Rachel the VOIGHT-KAMPFF test. He's never given a Voight-Kampff test before. He makes a phone call. He has never made a phone call before. And, of course, he has never killed anyone.This way of interpreting Deckard's actions is provocative not necessarily because it's so radically different a take on reality from what we're used to, but because it's a play on a dynamic that's so absolutely common. The main character's backstory is fictional in every movie. It's the stuff all screenplays are made of. The first time we catch sight of a character in a movie is, effectively, the first time he or she has ever really existed. Backstory is a thing we the audience believe in to create for ourselves that sense of reality or continuity which narrative so depends on.For instance, when The Maltese Falcon opens Sam Spade and his partner Miles Archer are sitting around their office. They're partners. They've known and trusted each other for years. They're worked on numerous cases together.But, of course, they haven't really. They only act like they have. It's just a movie. They don't exist prior to the first scene in it. The concept of Deckard's memory implants merely makes this idea much more literal.And making abstract, theoretical ideas literal is something the best science fiction has always been good at. Serious SF has the ability to confront a concept that's fuzzy and hard to wrap your head around and recontextualize it, turning it into something immediate and tangible.One of the proto- Sci-Fi masterpieces, Stephenson's Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde, does this as well as anything. After all, duality within the human soul had been dealt with and analyzed from any number of viewpoints. What Stephenson did was make the abstraction of moral duality more easily viewable by making it a much more real, immediate situation in which his main character experiences the extremes of this duality in clearly distinguishable personalities struggling for control within himself.False personal backstory isn't the only abstraction BR makes literal.There's no difference between what the replicants want and what anybody else wants. The conflicts that the replicants are struggling with are the same existential issues everyone confronts: I'm going to die. I don't know when. I don't want to. What's so unusual? But the fact that their problems are so essentially run-of-the-mill doesn't make the film less interesting. It makes it more interesting, as it bundles this familiar angst in a shiny new package and, successfully, freshens it up, letting us experience it as something novel and provocative.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Blade Runner (1982) Landmark science fiction,"When it comes to the best science fiction films in cinema, Blade Runner is always remembered among them. When watching the film it becomes clear why there is such exaltation. The story is incredible and very well told, with a fantastic philosophy that accompanies the development of the characters. Ridley Scott's direction is masterful, he presents this dystopian future in an excellent way that makes the story easy to understand. In terms of visuals, this film doesn't lose anything, all the characters have a very striking and interesting design.

"Ridley Scott, you've done it again!","""Blade Runner"" stars Harrison Ford, and is about a detective, known as a blade runner, who must kill replicants (robots). The concept itself is interesting enough, allowing for an endless amount of paths for the film to approach. ""Blade Runner"" has an incredibly grim yet beautiful landscape with a seemingly endless torrent of rain which adds atmosphere like hardly any other sci-fi. Deckard (Harrison Ford) is involved in a huge case which results in amazing battle and action sequences. The sets are masterfully created, but the second half of the film is where the pace and story-line heighten with incredible battles and scenes involving Rutger Hauer as Roy (the main replicant antagonist) who delivers a performance making him one of the most memorable antagonists of all time, equalled by the Xenomorph of ""Alien"". Three years, in fact, after the release of ""Alien"", Ridley Scott has once more made a spectacular, cult-classic science-fiction film; only this one challenges what the world may eventually succumb to in just two years time.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Blade Runner,"This time, it is Ridley Scott's turn to offer us his prognostication of a future wherein corporate America has, ostensibly benignly, introduced the ultimate in labour saving devices - androids called ""replicants"" - which have a look and feel of people about them. These ""Nexus"" creations can turn their hands to just about anything, but when the latest off-world models rebel, all of their cousins become outlawed and it falls to the ""Blade Runners"" to track them down and destroy them. ""Deckard"" (Harrison Ford) is one such operator who is called back out of his retirement to identify four of these highly adaptable and intelligent robots and this perilous task takes him to the heart of their manufacturer run by the fiendishly clever but unscrupulous ""Tyrell"" (Joe Turkel), and into a web of duplicity surrounding their controlling protocols and maybe even a fifth, almost impossible to recognise ""replicant"", whom - unlike it's contemporaries - has no idea that it isn't human. Ford is on cracking form here, as is Rutger Hauer - the android leader ""Batty"" and the dark, frequently rainy imagery contributes wonderfully to this seedily presented story of greed and manipulation set amongst a grittily dank and hostile environment that offers little, visually anyway, by way of hope or relief. It has a film-noir look and feel to it, and Scott keeps it moving well, keeps the dialogue sparse - though impactful, and the whole thing develops cinematographically some of the pretty profound questions brought up in the original Philip Dick novel about just what constitutes humanity. Just shy of two hours - it flies by, especially on a big screen where the visuals and audio still work wonders.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Blade Runner - Review,"This is a film that took me at least 3 viewings to fully appreciate (Like most people apparently), now is one of my favorite films of all time. Blade Runner is in every way, a flawed master pieces, a film that has problems that everyone overlooks because of how good the film itself is, the visuals are by far the stand out of the movie, they still look outstanding, so many years later, and the special effects have barely aged for the most part, the environments were definitely something unique for their time and you can see how they became an influence for so many films of the genre that came after it,the world feels alive, real and it's an amazing achievement, the directing by Ridley Scott is one of the best I have seen in his entire career and the musical score by Vangelis is fantastic and the script is excellent, the story while pretty straightforward, there are so many details that requires you to pay attention to fully understand what is happening or in some cases, what might be happening, Harrison Ford also delivers in my opinion one of the best performances of his career, through the entire film i didn't saw Ford, I saw Deckard. The film has flaws that lie mostly in some scenes that do drag a bit too much and some plot elements here and there that could either be shorten or skipped entirely, but like I said, those flaws are overcome by everything the film does right and that's why Blade Runner is to this day considered a master piece.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"More like Blade Jogger, but still obviously influential","I gotta make sure I throw this disclaimer in near the beginning: Blade Runner is not an action sci-fi flick. Yes, it's from Alien director Ridley Scott who would later give us movies such as Gladiator and The Martian. But Blade Runner is much different. It certainly has sci-fi appeal and influence-- video games such as Final Fantasy VII and Mass Effect clearly took notes from the film, and directors such as Christopher Nolan have cited this film as inspiration, but it also doesn't fall into the trippier territory of films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey. Based on the cleverly titled book Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep by Philip K. Dick (he died before the release of the film, but praised what he saw which was about the first 20 minutes), this movie is much more philosophical. Perhaps Blade Jogger would be a more fitting title-the pacing is very deliberate and not at all what I was expecting.The movie stars Harrison Ford who was determined to not wear a hat because he was just coming from Raiders of the Lost Ark. The year is 2019 and genetic engineering has advanced so far as to create androids, or replicants, that are superior in intelligence and physicality. Their telltale sign is their responses to questions that are supposed to evoke human emotions. Created to work as slaves, replicants have rebelled in off-world colonies (remember this is 3 years from now) and are declared illegal on Earth and are to be terminated (they use the word retired) if found. This is where Ford comes in when it's discovered that 6 replicants have returned to Earth. Obviously, this has all the ingredients to be a thrilling action flick. But it takes a much different direction. Replicants are designed with a failsafe that automatically retires them after 4 years. It produces cool, thinking quotes like, ""It's too bad she won't live. But then again, who does?""Ridley Scott liked the idea of Ford being a replicant, but Ford has stated that he despised that idea and said that before filming Scott agreed with him that his character is definitely human. Now I won't spoil anything, but I will say that it's a question toiled with during the film. Also, if you watch the movie, watch the director's cut version (which technically isn't fully Scott's cut) because the ending is much much better than the theatrical cut of the film.Really, above sci-fi or philosophical or whatever, I'd describe this film as weird. I'm not sure what you're expecting from the film going in, but it's not what you're going to get. There isn't ever a clear tone established, and this just adds to the difficulty of describing just what the film is. Even the highly-regarded score switches from slow, dark melodies to jazzier moments. I will say, however, probably the most consistent element of the film is the lighting. It's certainly always on the darker side, but all the ways the light comes through in every scene is skillfully crafted.In all honesty I can't even say I'm much of a fan of this film. I didn't care for how it was edited, and some of the sub-plots really were weird. The movie succeeds in getting you to think, but it also makes you wonder what you just watched. I'm not sure how many times or how precisely I can say it, but it's a strange film. Not strange like drug-fueled Trainspotting, and not confusing like Stanley Kubrick, but more cerebral like the very ends of the films 28 Days Later and Sunshine. I can't say you will enjoy this film (possibly because I can't say I enjoyed it), but I'm extremely curious about the sequel, and for that alone it might be worth checking this film out. And in case of rain, make sure to grab yourself a light-up umbrella. Those things are so cool.

One Marvellous Movie,"Matchless. A magnificent meditation on the reality of death, and life's ultimate lack of meaning. One or two mentally challenged reviewers have complained that ""replicants"" could easily have been created a different colour, say, green; or been given six arms. Why were they made exactly the same as human beings? Answer: because they are exactly the same as human beings. In fact, all human beings are replicants of oneself. They are what one sees with one's own eyes, in the mirror, and all around one. If you follow the film closely. I think it was Ogden Nash who wrote: ""My fellow man I do not care for/ I often ask me what he's there for/ The only answer I can find/ Is reproduction of his kind."" Had he lived a little later, he might have written ""replication of his kind"".One of the brighter dumb-dumbs points out, in a puzzled way, that there are no children in this vale of tears. Well, there wouldn't be, since replicants are made instead. As well as toys for scientific Sebastian to play with. There's something of him in all of them. What exactly is Tyrell playing at? God knows. Why, exactly, were the pyramids ever built? What was the point of burying everything of material value inside them? I'll tell you about my wrapped-up mummy, you trick-cycling apparatchik. Take a trip to see her for yourself.Another thing. Without memories we have no identity at all. We only exist because we have learned to walk and talk, and remember how to do it. Who could we possibly be without our collection of mental photographs? Search me. Another thought: could there be a collective subconscious, and was Jung possibly right? Are unicorns part of everyone's folk-memory?Everything about Blade Runner is fabulous. It soars where the clunky and only semi-literate Kubrick stumbles and fumbles. Even greater than Marienbad, which sadly shot itself in the corporation; or anything by Bergman. The performances are nonpareil. The girl playing Rachael (funny spelling) is perfection itself.

"Great, but requires more than a single viewing","When I first saw ""Blade Runner"" I was severely disappointed as I felt it had wasted a great deal of potential. I didn't like the acting much, I didn't like the music and the whole neo-futuristic-film-noir thing wasn't very impressive as it's been aped in films for the past two decades and some of them have done it a bit better.I felt the romance between Harrison Ford and Sean Young was entirely unbelievable and given very little time to develop - it's him suddenly wooing her and romancing her without much actual chemistry forming. Their romance is a vital part of the story but I felt it was given very little focus.However on second and third viewing I suddenly realized what a masterpiece ""Blade Runner"" is. I seemed to ""get"" it; perhaps I understood the point of the film's ending more. I originally loathed the wacky OTT climax, considering it stupid and unoriginal/unimaginative - but on second viewing I picked up on all the subtleties and was touched by Hauer's final speech, particularly the ""like tears in rain"" moment.Overall this really is a fantastic sci-fi film noir story - it successfully mixes various genres. Its effects are a bit outdated now and if you sit down to watch it expecting too much you're likely to be disappointed - it has its fair share of flaws (from technical to story-wise) but if you can overlook some of these it really is a great deal of fun, even if it's not ""the"" best science fiction film (as some people have claimed).",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Legendary Classic or Distorted Rating?,"Goodness! 'Blade Runner' (1982) scores 8.2/10 out of over 600,000 IMDb-users.
When that movie appeared, I was just finishing school and loved Ridley Scotts 'Alien' (1979), one of the greatest SF-movies ever made. Like so many others, I was eager to see Scott's next strike, but the disappointment was all over the place - most who went to see it uttered explicit warnings. It was perceived as extremely boring, with a thin narrative plot stretched to the limits, so that the entire movie seems to be in slow motion. No thrill at all, no tension. The only appreciated point was its dystopic, sinister style, making this a showcase for style-over-substance-movies, which it still is today.
But part of the community apparently loves this style and gets fascinated with the dark expression of the movie's content, irrespective of how thin and stretched it may be. While these people dominate internet platforms and movie magazines, they still make only a tiny fraction of the audience out there. Public numbers indicate that about 83 million people paid to see 'Alien' but only about 8 million came to 'Blade Runner' in 1982. Yet, 'Blade Runner' was the long expected successor, meaning that over 70 million potential cinema-visitors stayed away because most of those watching 'Blade Runner' where disappointed, which spread by word of mouth. Without 'Alien', 'Blade Runner' would have probably even gone unnoticed.
The number of this audience is two orders of magitude higher than the users voting 'Blade Runner' to a top-rated legendary classic. Therefore, in reality, the audience has voted this movie (by simply ignoring it) as one of the most overrated bores in SF-history.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Philosophical Analysis (abridged class paper),"This philosophical analysis of the film Blade Runner is an abridged version of a school paper I wrote during my first semester at college. Upon evaluation, I feel there is much more I could add to this.This is my personal subjective and analysis of the film and the philosophical writings of Turing and Hume referenced below. Alan Turing gave his answer to the question of whether or not machines could ever be capable of thinking like a human being as a 'yes.' Many philosophers and great thinkers of history stated the answer would be, ""no."" While it is often agreed that computers can think in certain but not all ways, it raises the question, ""how would we even know if a computer is thinking like a human being or not?"" Turing stated that it is polite to assume everybody thinks as the only person one can know positively thinks is one's self. With this in mind, it can be concluded that machines can one day be assumed to have human thought just as validly as any person besides one's self does. Turing looked at a party imitation game as an inspiration to develop the Turing Test, a game in which a judge must decipher if he is speaking to a computer or a person and if the computer can be mistaken to be human, it can be concluded to possibly have human-like thought.In the film, four bio-engineered humanoids – known as replicants – come to Earth illegally and become targets for execution. The process of replicant execution is referred to as retirement, perhaps because the layman would look at replicants as not humans, therefore their executions would not be considered genuine deaths. The film utilizes the fictional Voight-Kampff Test – a test parallel to the Turing Test designed to determine if someone is a replicant or not by asking a series of questions and looking closely at iris dilations and pupil fluctuations to decipher if their emotional response is not human. Towards the beginning of the film, the replicant character Leon is given the test with suspicion of him being a replicant. Before murdering the questionnaire, Leon responds to several questions in an evasive and curious human-like way easily, thus passing the Turing Test before the Voight-Kampff Test really began. The character Rachael believes herself to be human but is then given a the test by Deckard and is then discovered to be a replicant. The line between artificial intelligence and human intelligence becomes blurred, so much that only the slightest details would give away the difference. According to the film, artificial intelligent beings are in fact able to pass the Turing Test and therefore are able to think for themselves.With this in mind, mankind ever does create a machine that claims to be able to think and potentially turn away from initial programming, I believe we should not automatically assume they do not genuinely think, and possibly treat such a machine as a living organism. David Hume once wrote: ""As a memory alone acquaints us with the continuance and extent of this succession of perceptions, 'tis to be considered, upon that account chiefly, as the source of personal identity. Had we no memory, we never shou'd have any notion of causation, nor onsequently the identity of our persons beyond our memory . . ."" and "". . . memory does not so much produce as discover personal identity, by shewing us the relation of cause and effect among our different perceptions."" I interpret and summarize Hume's writings as stating memory is not what makes somebody a person as other philosophers may believe, but rather helps one know their personal identity.The character Racheal learns she not only is a replicant destined to die within a short amount of time, but that her memories had been programmed by her creator, Tyrell. Racheal essentially loses nearly all understanding of her personal identity but as she exists, she does not lose her personal identity altogether.While not officially stating it, the film hints that Deckard, is not only assigned to retire replicants, but also a replicant himself. This is further explored in The Final Cut in which Deckard dreams about a unicorn and at the end of the film finds an origami unicorn on the floor presumably left by his work partner, Gaff, who had previously been shown with an origami match-stick man. Towards the end of the film, Gaff tells Deckard that he has done a man's job while before treating him more unfairly, further suggesting Deckard may be a replicant. With this in mind, it appears Gaff not only knows Deckard's basic whereabouts and thoughts, but possibly created Deckard with programmed memories that may belong to Gaff. If this theory is true, Deckard's understanding of his personal identity is false, but his actual personal identity is not, as memories do not create personal identities but helps people understand their personal identity. The character Roy Batty, moments before death, says the following lines to Deckard:""I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time like tears in the rain Time to die...""One could conclude with Hume's writings that Batty's memories are not what makes him a person but helps him understand his personal identity. With his memories gone, his understanding of personal identity would cease to exist, but by saving Deckard's life and sharing his memories, he allows his personal identity to continue existing as Deckard would remember him. As Batty dies, a dove he was holding is released and then flies into the air, suggesting his soul left his body and makes its way to Heaven. As his personal identity lives on and despite being artificial, he is in fact a person.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"""Tears in Rain""","***Review contains no plot summary or spoilers*** ""Blade Runner"" is an oppressively dark and sad Sci-Fi noir dystopian film, but undeniably gorgeous and genius in its craft. An outstanding, wonderful classic that has endured time and criticism. Ridley Scott has never reached this pinnacle in his career since, which is so unfortunate. He has a remarkable filmmaking talent like the greats of Stanley Kubrick and Orson Welles. Upon first full viewing of the film, I was drawn in by the visual effects and the narrative. As the credits rolled, I thought with teary eyes how could humanity be so cruel. The film leaves ambiguous questions that may or may not have answers; allowing philosophical speculation. Many films today give you answers, even if the answers are stupid. There is a book called ""Eyes Wide Open"", and in the book the author asks Kubrick what he thought about Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" and the Holocaust. Kubrick replied, ""Schindler's List was about success. The Holocaust was about failure."" ""Blade Runner"" does not romanticize the mainstream Hollywood formula of happy endings (or at least the Final/Directors Cut) and individuals, but instead focuses on major aspects of the society portrayed in the film. The acting in ""Blade Runner"" is superb, especially from the wonderful Rutger Hauer. Los Angeles is stunning thanks to visual effects designer Syd Mead and direction by Ridley Scott. Greatest use lighting ever used in film. A true landmark in the history of art. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A beautiful and marvelous film - quite possibly the best science fiction film ever made,"This text is referring to the director's cut of Blade Runner. What is science- fiction? Is it a future world controlled by machines that involves virtual reality? e.g. The Matrix Or is it something happier, but a world rid of crime? e.g. Minority Report Could it be a world that is dark and is dominated by large skyscrapers and the streets filled with all sorts of character? Enter Blade Runner. Ridley Scott was a new comer at the time of making Blade Runner, and was also quite interested in science- fiction/ fantasy. He completed Alien a few years earlier and three years later he'd make Legend. But the real mastermind behind Blade Runner is of course Phillip K. Dick, who wrote the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? Having read the novel, it would only seem fair for me to judge on both levels of an adaptation and a film alone. Harrison Ford plays Rick Deckard, a futuristic cop also known as a Blade Runner who's duty consists of hunting down robots who appear to be humans, known as Replicants. After a fellow officer is wounded and ends up in critical condition, it is Deckard's job to hunt down six deadly Replicants who killed the crew of their ship and are now lose in L.A. The year is 2017, and the world mainly consists of Asian overtones, with floating vehicles and colorful ground leveled areas. As Deckard, Ford does a noteworthy job by portraying the overall sad and tired quality of Deckard, his performance is certainly not exceptional by any means but it fits the story. On top of it all, this is the Rick Deckard from the novel. Rutger Hauer plays Roy Batty, the mysterious and dangerous leader of the Replicants, who's performance is one of dark strength yet at the same time a sort of provactive mystery. He says his lines with a curious yet commanding voice, and he is definitely the top performer in the cast. Sean Young plays Rachel, a mysterious worker of Tyrell who later becomes somewhat involved with Deckard. Also in support is Darly Hannah as the seductive but harmful Replicant Pris, and James Edward Almos as Gaff, a mysterious man who knows more about Deckard then the viewer seems to. The cast isn't exactly exceptional by all means, they don't turn in Oscar refined performances by any means but it fits the bill. Written by David Web Peoples and Hampton Fancher, the script loosley ties in with the novel but still captures the important essence of it. It's a solid script, could use a bit more attention to detail but there are some definitely remarkable lines. Ridley Scott directs with a real persistence for story and characters, and he is also the man responsible for delivering all the goods. His direction is fully realized and fully capable, painting such an illusive and enchanting vision of a nightmarish future. As an adaptation of a novel, it's not the best one ever, but is still somewhat succesful but it stands out more as film. Science fiction features like Blade Runner come in few numbers, and such beautiful and tight special effects that perfectly balance out with the story are hard to find. This is a film that should always be treasured, a gem that will stand the test of time. Grade: A +",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Misses the mark.,"Blade Runner has so many good things going for it, but the few flaws it has, brings it down. Featuring breathtaking set design and brillant special effects, plus it has a great cast and great direction. But the script is only so-so, and not fully developed, and the film is overlong.

My rating: 6,"You are asking yourself why I write about this movie now. I am answering: I have not seen the movie before and I was mistaken it with another one. Also I know that it is well known.Probably it was hit on its time. I thought of it as a story of the future but told with the resources of the 80's. 1982 it was published for my surprise. I can now explain better Harisson Ford in it. Very good scene in front of his door in his apartment.Long, slow, caring away without little dialog. Little but essential. It look over the questions of extreme of human existence, emotions and moral. Of insufficiency of given time for existence. In the end I thought that is talking about war and training people and sending them to battle.It talks about 2019 but I hope that our problems will be then the same and even be gone. That people will be more sober and humble. This is all for the replicants and their creators.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
An intelligent and ambiguous sci-fi noir that's never afraid to make its audience think thanks to its interesting ideas and subtly significant subtext.,"'Blade Runner (1982)' is a slow-burn, for sure, and its
nuts-and-bolts plot is almost nothing compared to the supplementary story that runs along side it, but this science-fiction film-noir is a remarkably intelligent and self-assured piece that tackles grand themes and interesting ideas with a real confident verve. It also treats its audience with respect, to the point that many will miss a lot of the subtle yet significant subtext placed within the tangibly grimy future the flick convincingly presents. While the unpolished yet awe-inspiring visual vistas and hauntingly beautiful synth soundtrack are what immediately grab your attention, it's the quiet contemplative moments where the picture finds its own identity as one which values the existential questions its audience must inevitably ask far more than action set-pieces or an 'appeal to all' mentality. It's a very unique and introspective picture that never calls attention to itself but should keep you thinking long after its sombre and ambiguous end. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A boring visual gem,"The aesthetics are mindblowing, even in 2021, but the plot is dull, weak and predictable.I had to skip over several scenes that were unnecessarily violent and some other things were absolutely unconvincing - such as always finding the one person you're looking for in the most overcrowded city of all times, or the love story that you can see coming from miles away. As much as I enjoy slow-paced and ambient films, Blade Runner's slowness is due to its ridiculous lack of plot development.

"Philosophical, futuristic, stylish, just plain awesome: Blade Runner!","The views in Blade Runner, from the beginning, are just amazing...that's all i know how to put it. It's not flashy and screaming for attention like today's science fiction movies.If futurism was art, Blade Runner's subtle futuristic details (including such things from architecture to the gleaming sky) would be more Ancient Egypt or Renaissance than 3-year-old with neon finger paint for recent Sci-Fi films. Not meant to be so scathing of today's films, but when I first saw Blade Runner I was awed. It was so stylish, so smooth, so elegant. Maybe I'm looking at it from an odd perspective, but I found the entire movie, Ridley Scott's amazing use of light (or should I say usually lack of), and all the carefully placed metaphors to just be incredible. Looking back at Star Wars, it definitely lacks (in all aspects) and just can't compare. If a movie was all looks and no content, it would be flat and not be able to support its own weight and it only crumble!! [or it would just get bad reviews =)] However, Ridley Scott drew on inspiration from 2 well-known books (the title book-""Blade Runner"", and ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?""). While relying more on the concepts of ""Do Androids"",  Ridley still changed the plot greatly while managing to come out with a big ""thinker"" movie. The producers attempted to change his final product but now (19 years later) usually you can get it in the True original form, the Director's cut. One of my favorite scenes, the unicorn scene where Deckard has a dream of a unicorn while playing the piano in a daze, is one of my favorite scenes and is cut out of the ""edited"" version. This scene could be interpreted as important to understanding stuff in the movie, but I'm gonna make you watch it to figure out why!Maybe the greatest thing about Blade Runner is the philosophy aspect of it. Without giving away crucial parts of the film, the best scenes were the ones involving the ""Replicants"" (androids) where one's mirroring emotions of sympathy and anger push back and forth at seeing these killing machines defend their humanity and right to live before their human counterparts. I also found the humans' seemingly lack of understanding of the very things they created intriguing as well. All these things the movie dealt with; but to understand better you must watch the movie.Blade Runner is an amazing movie, and I would say Harrison Ford's best science fiction movie ; ). If anyone has not seen this movie they need to get to a movie store and rent it now because it is one of the greatest movies ever.

A Good Movie,"I neither think that this movie is a masterpiece or a piece of garbage. I jsut think this movie is ""good"".I kinda liked the what the movie is tryna tell us, but this not in the area of the movie, rather the book. So I can't take this as a criter.For an 80's movie, I think the cinematography is pretty good, it was elaborate. Not only the futurist scenes, also the inside ones with the puppets and so on. It does not expand my horizons but at least it didn't caught my eye too.I think the ""replica"" actors really nailed being a replica, as they find the perfect spot between a robot and a human, congrats to Rutger Hauer for this good performance.And that's it. Besides from how this movie affected the ""cyberpunk"" movie endustry it was a pretty good movie. Also it is kinda philosophical if you are fond of it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
I will trigger the hardcore fans,"I'm going to say it immediately: I didn't particularly like the overall design of the futuristic Los Angeles. Ok, I've said it, I've said it. Now I'll articulate better what I think about this movie. As I said I wasn't fond of the design but not because it's ugly or what, it's just my personal taste. Indeed if we consider the time when it came out (1982), the work done is remarkable and the instances where you think: ""this has aged badly"" are like two or three and it's pretty impressive. But it wasn't for me. Even with the plot I had some problems but I liked a lot other things. The story is simple and linear and there wasn't an unexpected moment but it's instead prevedibile in a lot of ways. On the other hand I was on board because of the charismatic protagonist and the memorable villain, that steals the show every time he is on the screen. But most importantly what I liked more is the mysterious sense about some plot points. In fact, despite a linear story, there are some elements here and there that makes you wonder about the real nature of some characters and the film does not answer to these questions. And I personally like when a movie leaves you with some thinking about what's the right interpretation even if there's no a clear one.
And so overall I liked ""Blade Runner"" (the final cut) but, even if I recognised the enormous importance it has on the history of cinema, I don't think it's the masterpiece a lot of people claims this movie to be.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Cold, but still hauntingly poetic and violent sci-fi classic, with unforgettable climax","Note that this is a combination review; I saw the original once in 1982 and the Dir's Cut now in 2009 - which changes the ending/final voice-over - but that doesn't really diminish the overall effect of my lasting liking of this sci-fi action classic:Very straight, cold focus on story (of Ford as future hunter of runaway androids in L.A, the year 2019) instead of character development, (as many critics point out) but I don't really care... since production design and special effects techniques are still justifiably fantastic and beautiful. And what's more, I now notice how hauntingly poetic (ah, Vangelis' ethereal music score!), darkly enigmatic and contemplative it is, among its bursts of thrilling, unforgettably violent action. And what about that mesmerizing, Gothic climax with Rutger Hauer's menacing presence?! Wowser.7 out of 10 from Ozjeppe.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Harrison Ford is AWESOME!,"As I watched 'The Blade Runner' I was blown away. I realized that how did the science fiction dystopian film started. This neo-noir film is directed by the 'father' of Director's Cut Ridley Scott. It's starred by the phenomenon actor Harrison Ford, Sean Young and Edward James Olmos. The story is intriguing that blows away all my expectations. The acting is much more realistic like the visuals that gives a different feel as if I was watching a film based on the present, not like the typical 80s. True that the 80s were the golden era of great films. The only flaw is the pacing of the movie and the things that pleased me is the acting and its originality.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Complete and human,"Back in 82 when i saw this film,i never dreamed of the spectacle it showed with brilliance and awe.Ridley Scott to me is a director who sees raw naked feelings either from being shot to tortured.In blade runners scene of priss being shot three times,and yet not being able to die right away,the thrashing and screaming of agonizing pain is true to life.Most people shot don't die right away,instead they try to desperately to cope with the searing pain that a shot can inflict.And in that scene alone,made the hairs on the back of my neck stand straight up.Ridley captures the constant bombardment of humanity at its worst,then takes it to the next level.This film was made way ahead of its time,as a great detective film.With the classic narration of the private eye,telling us his ups and downs of trying to put a handle on his emotions through troubled times.But the single most beauty of it all,is from Douglas Trumbulls special effects.I was blown away from the sheer precision of machines,to towering buildings,reflecting an age of electric ambiance.His work is unrivaled,including close encounters of the third kind,and brainstorm as being his best work.This film gives movie goers a great genre of dark noir mixed with old fashioned detective work.To me this film will go down in history as the greatest work of ridley scott to date.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Visually stunning, thought provoking and incredibly moving.","Blade Runner stands as one of the most beautifully constructed and influential films for many film makers of all time, and after over a quarter of a century and many viewings, that beauty and awe has never faded. On the surface it may seem like an action movie, but when looked into more closely what can be seen is a deeply philosophical allegory on the concept of life. It's a gripping story of 'Blade Runner' detective Rick Deckard, hunting Replicants; robot slaves who have gone AWOL and returned to earth seeking one thing: a longer life after being designed with a four year life span. The setting, a rain soaked, neon hazed futuristic 2019 LA oozes an overpopulated, multi cultured, crime ridden world, thus giving the film a more dangerous and seedy feel. It's a world that looks like it's been lived in for a long long time, and for a film made in 1982 was way ahead of it's time and still looks impressive today.The casting is pitch perfect, with Ford giving a strong, tough yet vulnerable presence as the uncertain Deckard, torn between killing Replicants yet falling in love with one. Rutger Hauer gives one of the best performances I have ever seen as the violent Roy Batty, who, though may seem frightening, evokes a sense of pity as the audience discover all this man really wants is more life. Rachael, the Replicant Deckard falls for, is played by Sean Young and she both succeeds in being absolutely beautiful yet giving off a robotic aura as she interacts with Deckard. The rest of the cast all put in amazing performances, notable mentions including Edward James Olmos as Gaff, Joe Turkel as Tyrell and the other Replicants.Vangelis' soundtrack fits perfectly with the setting created in Blade Runner, whether showing swooping dazzling cityscape shots, or dim close-ups inside Deckard's shadowy apartment. It's tones, ranging from mellow, jazzy piano and horns to tender electrical synthesisers complement all the scenes perfectly, evoking the dark urban world on display.Overall, for many Blade Runner is not only one of the best in science fiction but also one of the best films of all time. Considering it's difficult creation and eventful history, all the cast and crew, particularly director Ridley Scott, excelled themselves to bring us this wonderful piece of film-making that today still makes audiences question what it is to be human.

Very deep movie..,"This movie was very different from the usual sci fi movies that I have seen. It was very unique and different.The music and the visuals were absolutely stunning for its day and age since it is a very old movie. The acting and dialogue were well thought of and planned. THe plot was very simple and concise, and was well done. The tone or the vibe the movie gave off was sad and depressing, but I liked it though.I just had problems with the pacing. The beginning and the end were good but the middle was just so slow in my opinion. I know the director wanted the audience to be immersed and engaged in the slow scenes when the characters would talk too each other and the long stops between conversations. I tried to be engaged but I couldn't. And also I felt like they left a few questions unanswered and got me confused and irritated.From a netural stand point it was a good movie, it had its moments here and there, the ending was very emotionally moving, and the themes discussed in this movie was quiet unique from other sci fi movies during its time. For me personally I wouldn't watch it again though.Memorable: No Rewatchable: NO.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Good entertainment,"Good entertainment. As I'm sure everybody knows there are several versions of the film, my comments are based on the original UK release. This is a prime example of neo-noir cinema with its consistently dark setting, lots of smoking and Harrison Ford's world-weary voice over. Ford plays Deckard, a Blade Runner who's job is to hunt down artificial people known as replicants who used as off world slave labour but aren't permitted on Earth. A group of them have returned and are trying to find their creator. Initially we don't know why they have returned but soon learn that they were built to last only four years and as their time is running out they seek a way to fix themselves.In his pursuit of them he is sent to see the head of the Tyrell corporation, who had designed the replicants. Here Deckard is introduced to Tyrell's assistant Rachael who unbeknownst to her is also a replicant who has been implanted with false memories. When she learns what she is she seeks Deckard again to discover what he knows.When the film starts we know that Deckard is clearly the hero of the film and the replicants, lead by Roy Batty played by Rutger Hauer are the villains but as the film progresses that idea becomes less certain. After all all they want is a life that isn't artificially shortened.The acting from Ford and Sean Young, as Rachael is very good but it is Rutger Hauer who steals the show as the enigmatic Batty, his finally speech is one of the great film speeches.

Quality Science Fiction,"Have seen this so many times now but had not watched it for a while. Then went to see it performed with a live soundtrack at the Royal Albert Hall. The show and performance was immense. Anyway back to the movie, great plot, great cast, great special effects. Has not really dated at all. The version I saw was the directors cut, which does not feature Deckards voiceover, which is a shame as I really like that and feel it adds something more to the movie. The one thing I really realised this time round was that it was difficult to identify who the heroes and victims really were in this. I always obviously rooted for Deckard but his profession is not that admirable really. The replicants actually care for each other and have feelings that few actual humans actually demonstrate in the movie. Yes the replicants are violent but at the same time they are only trying to survive. Providing them with feelings and emotions is cruel and then to ultimately end their life abruptly is a horrible way to go. They want answers, revenge, to live a decent life. They are treated like robots which essentially they are, but they have human feelings. You very much feel for them where as the humans, even Deckard at times are the aggressors and have very few redeeming features. The way Deckard seduces Rachael is actually quite rough. Knowing she is a replicant and also that she is very vulnerable makes it all very awkward to watch. Still a great science fiction movie, one of the very best ever.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"November 27, 2019 The Time of Blade Runner","Okay what has NOT been said about Ridley Scott's mind blowing look at November of the year 2019 with Harrison Ford's policeman dragged out of retirement and hunting down a group of dangerous androids trying to avoid their own death, so I'll make my review to the point. As for the date, well, since no day of the month is given, just November 2019, I guess you can
say that the movie takes place today, the 27th of November, at least I prefer it to.The good -
The special effects. Even today the special effects are astonishing. The sets are eye popping as well. The look of a future L. A., overpopulated, trashy, and being
so clogged up with smog that its always nighttime dark 24/7 - only the tallest buildings can look over the smog and see sunlight - while raining most of the time because of the pollution, now this was a great idea. Even Philip K. Dick, who happened to see some dailies
of Blade Runner before he passed on said the world that the movie set forth was very close to the one he imagined when he wrote ""Do Androids Dream of
Electric Sheep"", the novel the movie is based upon. As for the music. Vangelis' moody score adds even more depth. Then there is Harrison Ford's performance as Rick Deckard. Ford is well cast. He really gives a level to the character I don't think anybody else could pull off. In fact everybody's performance is good - especially Rutger Hauer's. He gives one of the the most vile, yet sympathetic villain performance you will ever see.The bad -
Well the story does kind of bog down a little. Is Deckard really a flesh and blood human, a tired old Blade Runner who hates his job and guzzles booze? Or is he a Replicant himself, recently programmed to think his existence is that of a tired old Blade Runner who hates his job and guzzles booze? The war between Scott and Ford on this subject is legendary and one of the main reasons the two did not get along. Scott said Deckard was a Replicant and left subtle clues
about it. Ford said the opposite and did the same as Scott to get his point across as well. This is what throws the movie off a bit. Is he one of them... yes or no? Well you'll just have to decide that for yourself... and sometimes that kind of ideology is only limited to how much it works. Like here.Another thing I will disagree with is the notion that Ford's narration is pointless, like Scott - and Ford as well - thought (they were forced by Warner Bros to put the narration in after preview audiences got confused on the narration-less storyline). It is why it is not in the Director's Cut, Scott removed it. But I feel it adds greatly to the atmosphere in Blade Runner, not takes away. And as a result the movie looses some of it's impact without it. The same goes for the original ""happy"" theatrical ending, which got the same treatment as the narration. The ending adds to the feel, not takes away. All of this is why I prefer the original Theatrical Cut over any other.The great -
Rutger Hauer's soliloquy at the end. No spoilers here as everybody has heard about this thing. Hell, it is even on the movie's soundtrack!. But when I saw Blade Runner back in 1982 (yes, I actually saw it in the
movie theater when it was released back then!) the soliloquy was not that well known at the time and it came out of left field for me. It made my
jaw drop! To me it sums up what the feel of the film is about, and that is being alive and existing and the personal experiences that makes us who we are. It is brief, poetic, and beautifully spoken by Hauer (who, incidentally, made it all up on his own!). I guarantee you, from the time you hear it, it will haunt you from that moment on.Even now this movie STILL demands your attention. Forget those who says the special effects and the fantastic sets are the movie's stars and not Ford, Hauer, Daryl Hannah, Brion James, or anybody else.

"Firstly, and above all a visual experience","I saw it for the first time, it was in 1996. It was the version released in 1982, I think it was that year, so in this review, I'll talk about this version made that year, because it was the first version that I saw. So to write a review, I will report the first experience.I saw it for the first time and I was amazed at the visual department of the movie. A harmonious blend, with an exemplary cinematography. Incidentally, I was not the only one, because Blade Runner influenced countless people. It's a unique case where a quality of the film stands out more, which marks the film forever and the general public gets this impression. Blade Runner, and above all, a visual experience with little or no element of drama. It's a visual experience, and if people want to take advantage, they should leave that aspect aside. This is the highest quality of the film, the ability to enter the audience in a cohesive way in that universe and live a visual experience. It's like most sci-fi movies of the 80's, a movie with strong male influences. That is, you will get here, scenes of violence and some nudity to the mix. But Ridley Scott, controlled himself and did not let the train out of the line. Yes, you also have here the evil corporation, but it was done in a more discreet way possible. no exaggeration, of course This is the big difference between a mediocre director and a good director, having a good self-control. Putting things in your movie at random is too banal and mediocre.The characters were well written, though Scott could not take much advantage of the great actors he had. Ridley Scott always had the problem of not being able to take 100% of the juice of the actors and put human emotions in his works, even in dramas (e.g. G.I Jane). But in this film, Rutger Hauer managed to put a lot of juice himself, especially in the third act, in the confrontation with Rick Deckard, which left the scenes excellent and striking like a great character. In the end, the film does not need much drama element, because there is something bigger here. An exploration, a discovery, that goes beyond the dramatic element. I think Ridley Scott got this great virtue. You get to get interested in the movie, even though it has very little character depth. This is because Scott, is primarily a visual director. There was not in the early 80's, director with better imprint for the visual department. And this for me, is a mark of success. You have difficulty in a job, however find other ways to overcome this same job or task. It is a high quality and a proof of great capacity. As the great director that Scott is, he finds it difficult to achieve characters' depths and achieve human emotions. He was able to create an experience almost 100% depth only with a single department, in this case the visual experiment. But let's be realistic, cinema is primarily a visual art. And like a visual work, Blade Runner is perfect at what it set out to do.In addition to the timeless visual aspect of the film, Scott was able to insert an exemplary sound aspect that further helps the viewers to be inserted into the film in an exemplary and cohesive way. The soundtrack is almost perfect for this kind of movie, strong and simple. But very well built. The dialogue is also well written in this film. In spite of many clichés and typical of the 80's, it ends up disturbing the experience a little, but it does not end with the experience of the film, but it hampers a bit in the final balance of the film. This is the proposal of this film, and if the film itself is consistent with its proposal, why not consider the film, a good movie. In the end, if you can overcome, the lack of dramatic element and depth of the characters, and the typical characteristics of the male productions. You will find here a great experience to live. Even for the present day, a unique experience in its own kind.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Time Passes On,Blade Runner is one of those great films that does not hold up as time passes-a lot of it is the nature of the film-a forecast in 1981 of 2019 that is laughably off mark and distracting. The other thing is the story moves at a snails pace which doesn't work as well these days.

Bladerunner at Cambridge arts picturehouse 5/4/2015,"There are enough reviews of this film without me bothering to go over the whole thing again, if u enjoy the film then u get it if u don't then its not for you and thats fine. I went to see blade runner in 1982 when it first came out and again 10 years later with the release of the directors cut, on both occasions i came away from the cinema just stunned at the brilliance and beauty of the film,i have of course viewed it many times since on VHS DVD and blue ray, but now 33 years after its first release the B.F.I had given me the chance to see it again on the big screen with a nationwide release of the final cut, 33 years, would it still be able to astound or with all the cgi and advances made would it look just a bit weary?.I didn't want to go to a multiplex to see it i wanted something intimate and atmospheric, luckily i live not far from Cambridge and i booked my ticket for 5 April 8.30 pm at the arts picture house ,it has several cinema rooms each of which house around 200 seats, it was a sell out, some young some middle aged all noisy until the adds and trailers stopped and then the instant the green tree logo appeared with the runrunshaw name ,silence not a sound,the crackle of anticipation was palpable,this is the most attentive and well behaved cinema audience i have ever been in, it was absolutely clear the audience were serious devotees of the film or at least serious about films and paid the showing the respect it deserved, the hades landscape came into view i was hypnotized,after what seemed like 5 minutes we were at the tears in rain scene and the elevator doors slammed shut.The credits rolled and no one moved, about 2 minutes passed before some people did start to leave, half the audience didn't leave until the credits were done and the lights came up, it was great to partake this experience with people who also care about the film, and to find yes it still is every bit as good as the day i first saw it and that it looks BETTER than cgi blockbusters because of the indefinable real quality from something that has actually been built rather than programmed into a computer graphic animation, a great experience, if u have not seen this film on the big screen take this chance to do it, not many films get released 3 times to a national audience this will probably be the last time .",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

One of the best sci-fi films made,"Science fiction is a genre that I love exploring and Blade Runner is regarded as one of the best sci-fi films ever made which is something I couldn't agree more.Blade Runner follows Deckard, a blade runner, whose job is to find and kill four replicants that have arrived on Earth to find their maker.Blade Runner isn't like any other sci-fi film I've seen. This is a film that doesn't contain an abundance of action but rather focuses more on the world we're presented with and for me that's the biggest selling point. For a film that came out in 1982, it's impressive how amazing the production design is. Ridley Scott fully immerses you into this dystopian, futuristic universe and the beautiful music composed for this film adds a layer of atmosphere to it. Alongside that Scott gives us a story that deals with a lot of themes. Whether it's relating to memories or what it means to be human, Blade Runner provides us with something really unique and complex. It surprised me how deep this film actually goes once you actually analyse it.People may be upset by the slow pacing and lack of action but I loved the way Scott told this story. This is what separates Blade Runner from other sci-fi films and it's the slower pacing that lets the viewer soak in the film's dystopian atmosphere and philosophical messages. The performances are great especially Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer who are a treat to watch.Blade Runner is certainly not a film for everyone. It's not mainstream but the way Ridley Scott directs this film and the astounding production design make Blade Runner special. The fact that so many films later on took ideas from Blade Runner shows how influential it is. I would definitely recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Replicants were too human,"Maybe I have too much reference material to allow me to enjoy this movie as everyone else has, being that I watched this in 2006 instead of 1982. Maybe in 1982 this movie would have been a lot better, but in 1982 I was too young to watch this movie let alone understand anything about it. The concept was a good one, that of life like robots, A.I., cyborgs, replicants, etc. but in this day an age that story has been told a million times in a million different ways (see A.I., Terminator 1-3, Matrix, Space Odessey 2010, I,Robot, etc.) Bladerunner was interesting and distinct from the standpoint that these robots only wanted to stay alive longer than the 4 years they were designed to. The movie as a whole was alright, I just couldn't get acclimated to the idea that these robots were too life-like. They not only displayed feelings, but they had feelings for each other, they feared death, they displayed panic, passion, and they sweat and cried. But what really took the cake was Deckard (Harrison Ford) sleeping with and ultimately falling in love with what he KNEW to be a robot, and likewise she fell in love with him.

... what if androids are more... human than us...,"""Do androids dream of electric sheep"" is much deeper and introspective. There are also a lot of important and essential events and characters that are missing from the movie; also, the book is cold... very cold.
On the other hand, the movie offers a different perspective; it's more emotional, more dramatic. Looks like this is another example where both the movie and the book are good in different ways, both are essential. It doesn't matter if you read the book before or after the movie; in fact, the movie motivated me to read the book!
In the book, you progressively get the general idea and philosophy; the movie is rushing everything towards the end - and this way, it feels more dramatic.
The eyes are the most prominent symbol in the movie (in my opinion)... ""just eyes"".
In conclusion, I like the fact that the movie is so much different from the book!
Oh, and holy crap, the soundtrack!

"The World it Builds is Timeless, but the Script Sure as Heck Ain't","Blade Runner is set in a futuristic world where robots have advanced to the point of being almost identical to humans. When they decided to act against humans, people called blade runners were hired to hunt down and destroy them. Rick Deckard, a former blade runner, is called back into action to take down a few robots before they can kill anyone else.The movie manages to pull off some fantastic practical effects. Everything looks real and unique, reason being it is. And it's awesome. I've always loved practical effects more than CGI, and here is no exception.The set designs are fantastic too. The world the movie builds looks great and feels authentic to an extent. It's immersive and interesting, and it's one I can't wait to continue to explore in Blade Runner 2049.Other than those technicalities, this movie sucks. For starters, the writing is terrible. The dialogue is generic and uninteresting, and the characters are the same. The first hour of the movie is consumed by literally nothing. I don't remember a single thing that happened. Deckard wasn't even looking for the robots, he was just kind of wandering around while the robots did the same. Then the last hour is just a rushed, forced, jumbled mess where so little intrigues that it almost gets boring. And to top it off, two characters end up in a relationship that is built around intimidation and two meet- ups, whereupon by the end we as the audience are expected to believe that they are in love. It just doesn't make sense.The climax is particularly bad. It seems to resemble Japanese anime in how completely weird and nonsensical it is. We've all seen it, live action anime doesn't work. 9/10 times anyway, and here isn't an exception. And even when it reaches it's end, there's no tension, no excitement, nothing. In fact, the movie becomes incredibly boring, and every second couldn't be longer.As a whole the movie is just super generic. The way in which Deckard ends up in this job is generic, the romantic aspect is generic. There's nothing new here.Overall Blade Runner is a huge disappointment. Sure, it looked pretty, but the first hour is literally nothing, the writing is uninteresting and the movie as a whole proves to be the same. I'm pretty sure there was even a plot hole in there, but maybe that was lost in the lack of anything in the first half. In the end I wouldn't recommend this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

A superb homage to film noir contained in the skin of a sci-fi movie.,"When I first saw Blade Runner (1982) many years ago, I understood that it was the quintessential, if not the defining, cyberpunk film. Since I was used to the more modern cyberpunk at the time (a la The Matrix (1999)), I felt the slow unfolding of exposition wasn't nearly as action-driven as I had hoped it would be. Of course, at the time, I might not have been watching the ""Director's Cut"" version of Blade Runner, which was what I watched this time around. Needless to say, it's a much better movie than I initially remembered.I think part of my improved assessment of this film came from a realization that it wasn't intrinsically a science fiction film. Sure, it is based on a story by Philip K. Dick, it is set in a fast-approaching and somewhat inaccurate representation of the future, and it has the trappings of a sci-fi film (i.e., androids, flying cars, technology, etc.), but at its heart, Blade Runner owes more to film noir than I realized. Take away the science fiction exterior, and you're left with the stark shadows filtering through the mists of cigarette smoke and humid clouds of Los Angeles while a ""detective"" tracks down the antagonist(s) of a crime. Classic noir.Probably because I hadn't seen a lot of film noir before seeing Blade Runner the first time, I never could have made the connection that this film is not what it seems, almost becoming its own allusion to the ""hidden android"" motif. Sure, Blade Runner still stands as a founding film of the cyberpunk subgenre of science fiction, but it only does so through the superb atmosphere and ambiance that is created via the noir style from classics like Chinatown (1974) and The Third Man (1949). Clearly, director Ridley Scott knows how to infuse science fiction into other genres, with Alien (1979) combining sci-fi with horror, and Blade Runner combining sci-fi with film noir.A superb homage to film noir contained in the skin of a sci-fi movie, I give Blade Runner 5.0 stars out of 5.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Future imperfect,"I can easily see why this film has become the cult movie it is today, regularly championed as one of the best sci-fi movies ever made. Considering it was made almost thirty years ago, it's still visually stunning with its neo-noir gloomy cinematography, the exterior shots made darker still with seemingly constant heavy rain mixed with an imaginative future vision taking in flying cars and outsize, almost floating video-advertisements, the latter at once familiar in its common-placedness and yet disturbing in its exaggeration and omnipresence.There really isn't that much of a story with Ford basically re-hired by the police force he previously left to track down four humanistic androids (called replicants) escaped to earth from a space colony and now determined to revenge themselves on their creator. Besides some interaction between Ford and the replicant creator's is-she-or-isn't-she P.A., the film moves inevitably towards a final confrontation between Ford's Deckard's character and the replicant leader, the sadistic, revengeful Rutger Houer.For me though, the film loves its own look a little too much and is ponderous to watch at times, interspersed by scenes of random but brutal violence. We fleetingly come across minor human characters who seem to have regressed from society none more so than JF Sebastian who becomes their link to ultimate target megalomaniac Tyrell, who lives in cluttered squalor alone with his homemade mechanical toys and robots.In fact I'll take cluttered squalor as pretty much my description of the whole movie. Inevitably it devolves to a showdown between a rampaging, but fast expiring Hauer and an exhausted, beaten-up Ford which doesn't play out as you'd expect and an enigmatic final scene which interestingly questions whether Deckard's mightn't be a replicant himself.""Blade Runner"" certainly succeeds in serving up a bleak vision of the future reminiscent of Fritz Lang's epochal ""Metropolis"" decades earlier. At times nightmarish in its sheer banality, it can be seen to have inspired future generations of directors and writers in film and print. Personally, it still seems to me like a short story elongated to movie length but there's no denying its imagination and artistic vision, even if I might have preferred a bit more pace and action along the way to lighten the darkness a little.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Still looks amazing,"""Blade Runner"" might have its flaws, but it is still the quintessential cyberpunk blockbuster. The undercooked love story and the goofy action sequences are the inevitable product of its time, but aesthetically it was miles ahead. I recently watched the director's cut 4K remaster and, hairstyles and old TV sets aside, it could almost pass as a fairly recent film. Ridley Scott goes for a neo-noir kind of investigation and paints the dystopian streets of Los Angeles in a decadent, almost gothic tone that reminds of his rainy London.Thematically, the plot raises questions about what it means to be human in a time where there is no perceivable difference between man and machine, to the point that even the nature of memories is to be questioned. These are pretty common reflections in sci-fi literature, and I always thought that ""Blade Runner"" limited itself to giving some cues without digging too deep into the mind of its characters for the sake of the few moments of action (the critics basically did the rest writing pages and pages of overanalyzing). Rick Deckard's motivation for what he does is never fully explored, and so is his rather forced relationship with Rachael. He walks around and defeats one replicant after another like in an arcade fighting game. The film makes a point to show how the androids are more united and human than the morally decayed men of 2019, but little screen time is devoted to exploring their nature.An impressive film for its time and solid cyberpunk neo-noir, but definitely not what I would call an all-time masterpiece.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

A beautiful and cinematic acquired taste.,"Blade Runner is a slow-paced, methodical science-fiction mystery about a detective (Harrison Ford) forced out of retirement to hunt down dangerous humanoid ""replicants."" Based on the book by Philip K. Dick, entitled ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep,"" ""Blade Runner"" focuses on creating a unique mood and atmosphere of a dirty and grimy future on Earth while exploring complex ideas about humanity.Upon seeing ""Blade Runner"" for the first time, the story and style might not engage the viewer initially. It's a slow-paced, film-noir style sci-fi that is far from action and plot driven. Ridley Scott makes use of grand camera movement, incredible set pieces, and a beautiful score to paint a special picture of a future. What's presented here is a thorough and intriguing mystery which may confuse some viewers who might be expecting a more violent Star Wars.Despite ""Blade Runner"" reaching a limited audience and developing a ""cult following,"" the film gets better and stronger with each viewing. Each time something new comes from the unseemingly layered narrative, motifs, and foreshadowing that makes it impossible to digest everything necessary upon the first viewing.Perhaps the film's strongest aspect is its thought-provoking themes about what it means to be human. If the story's very human replicants can actually feel emotions like humans, who and what are they? Where does the soul come in to play? What does it mean to ""retire,"" meaning execute replicants and how ethical is it? ""Blade Runner"" has the boldness to challenge the viewer about their own existence while still managing to feel optimistic, despite the heavier subject matter.Visually, ""Blade Runner"" looks incredible; especially the Final Cut version. Every frame of the piece is a work of art due to some wonderful cinematography by Jordan Cronenweth and meticulous production design by Lawrence G. Paul (""Back to the Future,"" Predator 2""). A large reason why ""Blade Runner"" is so well regarded could have something to do with their work in creating a genre of sci-fi that many films have been inspired from (Ghost in the Shell, Dark City, Soldier).""Blade Runner"" is truly a work of art and should be seen by everyone at least once.

All shine and no substance,"I saw this when it came out, and I didn't like it. I just saw it again for the first time in many years, and I still don't like it. I know a lot of people live this movie due to it's lush and highly-detailed staging. However, I don't like it for exactly that reason. Ridley Scott put all his effort into set decoration and staging, and absolutely no effort whatsoever into story or character development.""Blade Runner"" takes place in a future (for 1982) Los Angeles where it rains ALL THE TIME, where it is always night and never day and where, for reasons that are never explained, nobody ever turns on a light switch. The only lights at all are generated by garish, flashing advertisements that, for reasons that are never explained, nobody ever shuts out by drawing the curtains. If I lived in such a place I would draw my curtains and switch on my lights but, as I say, in the Los Angeles of the future, it seemingly never occurs to anybody to do that.The plot, where there is of it, revolves around a policeman whose job is to kill cyborgs who are supposed to live only ""off-world"" when they escape and return to Earth. However, unlike every other policeman I have ever heard of, he is expected to carry out his duties alone, without any back-up, and completely unsupported. There is one police character who dogs his tracks but, for reasons that are never explained (a lot in Blade Runner is never explained) he seems to constitute more of a nuisance than a help. In fact, he seems to have been assigned solely to keep tabs on the main character, rather than to aid him in any way.The cyborgs have several opportunities to kill the main character which, for reasons that are never explained, they each bungle clumsily. These cyborgs, who are supposedly super-human, super-strong killers, simply can't seem to bring themselves to kill this guy. Mostly they fail because they are too busy showing off to kill him. However, I suppose that, if they simply killed him, there would be no movie.Blade Runner might have made a good 1/2-hour ""Twilight Zone"", or 1-hour ""Outer Limits"" episode.

"Not just one of my favorite science fiction films, but one of my favorite films period.","Blade Runner is a sci-fi masterpiece. It has almost everything in a good sci-fi flick; breathtaking effects, a deep and philosophical story, good characters, amazing atmosphere, and a great cast. Harrison Ford brings his A-game with this one. This is probably one of my favorite performances of his. In my opinion this is Ridley Scott's best film, and one of my favorite movies period. Admittedly, when I first saw this movie I hated it. I gave the film another chance though and I grew to love it. The reason I didn't like it at first was because I wasn't in the right mindset for it. I was expecting a film like Star Wars which this is definitely not. You really have to be in the right mindset to view this. Blade Runner is not the movie you just pop in for a casual viewing to kill time or if you want to have a fun time. It's dark, atmospheric, philosophical, and has a downbeat tone throughout. This is most likely why Blade Runner didn't do well in theaters. This film came out the same year as E.T. Everyone wanted fun sci-fi which this film clearly isn't. Fortunately, over the years, it has become a cult classic, which it deserves to be.The film takes place in Las Angeles in the dystopian future of 2019. We follow a retired cop named Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) who is called back to the force temporarily. Several human-like androids called replicants have gone rogue and it is Deckard's job to bring them down.As I said, the film looks brilliant. I think the special effects are on-par with the Star Wars trilogy. Yes, it's not the most colorful looking film or very fun to look at, but that's the point. The film is going for a very realistic dystopian future with overpopulation, pollution, and very cultural. The acting is great particularly from Ford. The only characters worth mentioning are Deckard or the main replicants, Batty (Rutger Hauer). The story is told from their different perspectives. From following both of them we see both of their views on what it means to be human which is one of the main themes of the movie.There are things that can be seen as flaws with the film. When I first saw the movie there were many things I didn't like about it until I tried to see things differently. Firstly, the film moves at a fairly slow pace or, at least, it felt that way. This is a trait you see in most Ridley Scott films. The atmosphere and overall feel of the film is a little too good if that makes sense. If you are the slightest bit sleepy this film can easily put you to sleep. I just about fell asleep on my first viewing. I'd watch the director's cut or the final cut of the film if possible. In the theatrical cut you have Harrison Ford give narrations throughout the movie, and it just made the film even more of a snore fest. The film is trying to build atmosphere and enthrall you into the world it's created, but some people will probably have issue with it. It's not bad but I do think people will think the film is too padded-out.Another thing is the action scenes. The action in this film is not like Star Wars or Indiana Jones. Deckard is actually not a very good fighter. He gets his butt handed to him quite frequently by the replicants. This did really bother me on first viewing. However, I don't feel that way now. I think that the way they did the actions scenes made them feel more real. Besides, if they were to have Star Wars or Indiana Jones type action in this then it would conflict with the tone of the rest of the film.Overall, Blade Runner is a classic movie that should be seen at least once. Just go in with the mindset that this is not like Star Wars, Total Recall, E.T., War of The Worlds, or any of those sci-fi films and you'll be fine. It's sad that it didn't get much recognition when it was first released, but at least it is getting the treatment it deserves now.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"Not perfect, but outstanding sci-fi adaptation","For whatever reason, its taken me 34 years to make it through this film. This one of those ""must sees"" during college, from that generation during which the big budget sci-fi epic was coming into its own on the screen. I'd always known this was part of some upper tier of sci-fi filmmaking, along with Brazil, the unfortunate yet still intriguing Dune, and later on, City of Lost Children (and plenty of other things I've since forgotten. You know, short term memory was decimated in my 20s). This is the tier of films made by filmmakers, vs. film studios, Hollywood types and hacks--which were still enjoyable on some other level, but I'm sure I'd have hated films like my beloved Star Wars, had it come out while I was an adult--these films where, yes, there are some arresting visuals, a few, ahem, borrowed plot devices, and lots of whimsical entertainment value, along with loads of tired clichés that really offer us nothing more than entertainment--which is fine when you're six, and maybe beyond.I was always afraid that Blade Runner just kind of straddled this line between eye-candy and artistry. Plus, I was always watching these films, in college. You know how that goes. You're in some burned bro's dorm room eating pizza, and he's like, ""bro, you HAVEN'T SEEN this sci-fi epic/anime/Lebowski? DUDE. Hey, are you gonna pass that thing or not, bro?"" This never led to a true appreciation for cinema in one evening.So, here I am, 15 years later, sober in my mom's basement, like any good liberal arts student. At first, I'm a bit apprehensive. The synthesizers come in, and I immediately scrunch my face up. Oh, poor sci fi synths...still doomed to be an indicator of the short sited 1980's and its desire to seem as future-y as possible, in a New Wavy kind of way. Hell, that Roy guy could have been Sting (so glad he wasn't). And then there's Rachael's New Wave meets 1940's noir look, which took me a minute to process. However, I stuck with this film this time--and part of the reason was that I was finally watching this on a wide screen, which makes all of the difference. The 3 other times I watched this were on older televisions, with that boxy whatever you call it ratio that ruined so many films in their transition to VHS, before we decided that lopping off a 3rd of the picture from sight was sort of insane, like putting your hand over Venus de Milo's head and saying, ""oh yeah, I guess that's impressive or something"". The visual elements to this film are exceptional, in that they still amaze, and clearly set the groundwork for the next 30 years of sci-fi aesthetics.And the longer you stick with this film, through the pseudo-noir stuff (luckily this version lacked the much maligned narration--boo-hoo, I had to actually pay attention the whole time, rather than have everything spelled out for me, confusing as it was, at times), the more you will find it to be deeply affecting and poignant in its philosophizing. Of course, knowing this was a story by Philip K. Dick (whom I haven't read much of but really have enjoyed), I went into this film with a certain amount of expectations, concerning the ""intelligence"" of this movie. And this is one of the slippery slopes of sci-fi film adaptations: how the hell do you cram all of these aspects into 90-120 minutes, without either treating the audience as imbeciles and filling in all of the details via narration or a scrolling text prelude, or worse, omitting some of the very themes and ideas that make the original work enjoyable and important. Obviously, Dune failed miserably (though I thought the aesthetics were everything I'd imagined while reading the novels). I can't attest to Blade Runner vs. Do Androids Dream..., but I can say it was affecting as a stand alone work. I had horrible fears about some of the actors, particularly Roy, who just looks like an 80's cliché, yet in the second half of his film, where the emotional plights of ALL of the characters are really fleshed out in surprising detail for this kind of film, I was completely drawn in. There is enough emotional intelligence in this film that I was surprised that it came out of Hollywood! And I really haven't liked anything else Ridley Scott has done. And I wonder what Scorcese's planned version, if done in the 70's would have looked like! That aside, I'm glad I watched this movie, and without spoilers, I'll say that I was so pleasantly surprised by every facet of this film. Aside from those terrible synthesizers...I mean, they had her playing that melancholic bit on the piano, right during an emotionally tense part...yet they smear those awful synthesizers over it, and almost steer the whole thing into Hollywood melodrama..almost!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Philosophical,"Even one character we can safely assume is human, the reptilian Tyrell, czar of the corporation which manufactures replicants, strikes me as a possible replicant. And of the hero, Deckard (Harrison Ford), all we can say for sure is that director Ridley Scott has left clues in various versions of his film that can be used to prove that Deckard is a human -- or a replicant. The biggest change Scott made in earlier versions was to drop the voice-over narration from the 1982 original. Spoken by Ford, channeling Philip Marlowe, it explained things on behalf of a studio nervous that we wouldn't understand the film. Since much of the interest in the film has been generated by what we weren't sure we understood, that turned out to be no problem. The ending has been tweaked from bleak to romantic to existential to an assortment of the above, and shots have come and gone, but for me the most important change in the 2007 version is in the print itself. The action follows Deckard, a ""blade runner"" who is assigned to track down and kill six rebel replicants who have returned illegally from off-worlds to earth, and are thought to be in Los Angeles. (The movie never actually deals with more than five replicants, however, unless, as the critic Tim Dirks speculates, Deckard might be the sixth). Replicants, as you know, are androids who are ""more human than human,"" manufactured to perform skilled slave labor on earth colonies. Ridley Scott is a considerable director who makes no small plans. His credits include ""Alien,"" ""Legend,"" the inexplicable ""1492: Conquest Of Paradise,"" ""Gladiator,"" ""Black Hawk Down"" and the brilliant ""Matchstick Men,"" and his ""American Gangster"" opened Friday in theaters. He has the gift of making action on a vast scale seem comprehensible. I have been assured that my problems in the past with ""Blade Runner"" represent a failure of my own taste and imagination, but if the film was perfect, why has Sir Ridley continued to tinker with it, and now released his fifth version?",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Deep as an urban ocean,"Blade Runner is one of those movies you either get or you don't.  Some people find it bizarre and disturbing.  My father loves this movie and I watched it for the first time with him.  Blade Runner is complex and entrancing--the special effects still blow me away.  The gritty world created by Scott in this film is so believable that I wanted to become part of it.  Many fans of Dick's writing hold the movie up to the book, pointing out ""mistakes"" and other changes the script makes to Deckard and to the plot, but I think this is an erroneous argument.  Scott's film shows us a realistic portrayal of what city life might become, and focuses less on the man vs. machine theme of the book.  The two should be enjoyed as separate works, for each is superior in its own way.  Scott's Blade Runner is film noir meets sci-fi, and the result is magical.  Vangelis' floating, mysterious score doesn't hurt things, either; in fact, without it, I dare to say that the impact of the movie would not be as great.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Dull, shallow SF film","I saw this film several years ago and remember being disappointed with it. I saw it again after I read the book recently, and was again disappointed. For all the hype and critical acclaim, there's very little to recommend ""Blade Runner.""It's based on ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep,"" by the great SF writer Philip K. Dick, and the film is a very loose adaption.  That might be okay, except that they took out all the deep, interesting aspects of the book- especially the spiritual themes dealing with the futuristc religion, which is central to the novel.  Guess they can't have anything to do with religion in a Hollywood film.  Also, the characters are so bland.  I know, that's the point, humans have been dehumanized by technology, etc. But I haven't found this to be true in rel life and it certainly isn't true in the novel.  the humans are very human in the novel, concerned with being accepted by society, being loved, rising in social status, etc.  And it is easier to relate to Deckard in the novel, than Deckard in the film b/c he is more like us in the novel.  Also, the movie mostly ignores the animal aspect of the book (in the book most animals are extinct so if you own one it is a sigh of social status- also it is considered very wrong to eat an animal) so when the few references are made to animals, like the electronic owl or the empathy test Deckard gives, it remains unexplained.Okay, aside from taking out all the good parts of the book, it's not a good film anyway.  As to it being a film noir, this is true.  Stylistically it is very dark, no heros, murder plot, etc.  However, the great film noirs like ""Double Indemnity,"" and ""Chinatowne"" are great because they have engaging plots, with many twists and turns.  ""Blade Runner"" has a plot that can be summed up in one brief sentence.This is basically a film that puts style over substance.  The cinemetography and art direction are impressive.  The score by Vangelis is awesome.  But there's nothing to the film except some suggestiveness that technology is bad because it dehumanizes man, and androids as ""the other"" should be accepted maybe.  Of course these themes are nothing new, and the film does not present them in a fresh way, but rather within the confines of a dull film.It was a bad film, but I will say that the ending where Roy Batty makes his speech on top of the building was a great scene, surprisingly moving, especially considering that the rest of the film is so tedious.  For a minute it almost made me want to like it.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Existencialism and modern philosophy,"An existencial and nostalgic story. The way this movie sent the audience its true message is mind-blowing. It was so ahead of its time, it's hard to believe it came out in 1982. It's about the underlying causes of what makes someone human and not the questioning of wether someone is a Replicant or not. Asking that is just missing the point. Isn't just humanity the result of a conscious and rational mind? Isn't our humanity defined by our memories, our senses and feelings, our incredibly short lives compared to the ever expanding universe? Aren't we all just biological machines? So what does that make Replicants? Aren't they just the same machines but with a shorter lifespan? Living in fear, just wanting to be free - that being the 'itch they can never scratch'. No one is the villain in this movie, and I find that confusing yet beautiful. Morality is, therefore, represented by a social construct.The aesthetics and acting of the film are immaculate. The soundtrack does the 'man's job' and the final monologue was what made me love this movie the most. It will always be relevant, no matter what.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"Good but not great, like a replicant it's not what it really seems.","I first saw Blade Runner when it came out in the early 1980's and it didn't overly excite me, it was an ok sc-fi movie but nothing extraordinary.

I had read lots of positive and glowing reviews of Blade Runner, so I thought I must have missed something all those years ago?
From my most recent viewing. The film has some amazing scenery and sets, even more so when you consider when it was made. The story isn't overcomplicated and easy enough to follow. Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) a bounty hunter must hunt down 4 replicants (very life like robots) before they can cause chaos. One big downfall is the style that Harrison Ford plays his character, to me he came off mostly as a 1940's deadpan detective type, which didn't seem to work in the futurist world the movie is set in. The funny thing is how wrong the 1980's movie makers got what the world would be like in 2019! Sean Young and Rutger Hauer both do very well in portraying the troubled replicants, Rutger Hauer steals the show with his life like performance!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

This man is told by his boss (who has a weird face and walks like he has peanuts in his shoes) that he must chase down nine robots that have escaped from a top secret military base, (which is why everyone eats noodles with either beef or chicken, or sometimes prawns in there).The rest of the film is equally as rubbish. There are really bad special effects all over the place in this movie and none of them look like real things. I expected there to be more spaceships in a film of this type and one of the reasons the film is so boring is that there are none.

The past in the future,"The Los Angeles of the near future will, apparently, be very similar to the Los Angeles of the recent past. Yes, it's always raining, but otherwise Ridely Scott's 'Blade Runner' is set in a world recognisable from the novels of Raymond Chandler or from Roman Polanski's 'Chinatown'. The fact that the plot is about androids seems a minor detail, until about two thirds of the way through, when the film becomes darker and stranger. Themes resembling those of 'Logan's Run' start to emerge (the idea of premature mortality), and although the film ends with an action sequence, it's not shot quite like a conventional all-action finale, with more of an emphasis on mood and less on viscerality. The scene is accompanied (as is much of the rest of the film) by a soundtrack that unquestionably belongs in 1982 (when the film was made), but the overall effect is actually quite moving. Still, although more ambitious than Scott's earlier 'Alien'', 'Blade Runner' is also less perfect. Some details feel like oddities, thrown in for effect without making perfect sense, and Harrison Ford (in the lead role) struggles to convey complex emotion (although he is not playing an android, but allegedly a human). But it's certainly a brave and distinctive movie, and not without intelligence either.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
More Impactful than Memorable,"When it comes to highly beloved science-fiction films that left a huge cultural impact, one that comes to mind is Blade Runner, loosely based on Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep. Despite failing to generate much of an audience on its original release due to misguided marketing and a terribly botched theatrical cut, the film slowly but surely garnished a massive following to the point of being hailed as one of the greatest sci-fi movies ever made, as well as best films ever made, partially thanks to its reformed final cuts. That being said, while I admire the film's legacy, let's just say I respect it more than I enjoy it.Set in a dystopian future Los Angeles around 2019, where synthetic humans called replicants have been bio-engineered by the Tyrell Corporation to work in space, a group of fugitive advanced replicants led by Roy Batty escape back to Earth. So it's all up to a jaded cop Rick Deckard to hunt them down while dealing with an emotional replicant named Rachel who wishes to be human. Right off the bat, what makes the movie iconic is the world building, as the entire setting of this futuristic Los Angeles is just oozing with gritty atmosphere and a frightening aroma of criminal activity going around. In a way, the film mixes neo-noir with sci-fi in a very unique setting that it allows the environments to speak for themselves. Also, the aforementioned replicants are quite fascinating in concept, especially with how determined they are to get back at the Tyrell corporation for their poor treatment of them, and the likes of Rutger Hauer, Daryl Hannah, Brion James and Joanna Cassidy bring each character to life in their own special ways, even if Hauer steals the show with Roy Batty's subtly haunting demeanor.Speaking of performances, Harrison Ford really sells the mentally exhausted Deckard to the point where we as the viewers can identify with him the most. Knowing all the complicated details that go behind the caper and the occasional action packed sequences that show up, it allows for Deckard to thoroughly use his brains as opposed to his brawn, like a real detective. However, outside of Deckard and the replicants, the remaining cast ranges from general plot conveniences to underdeveloped potential, as the movie would rather focus on the specific mission than make them really stand out. The only true stand out is J.F. Sebastian, the genetic designer who Pris and Roy manipulate to get back at Tyrell. In addition to his fondness for crafting exquisitely elaborate toys, he ends up having a similar predicted fate as the replicants, making him just as sympathetic as them. It's characters like that which make the story more engaging than it might have been beforehand thanks to the added bits of substance you don't often get in the sci-fi genre.With that said though, what does keep me from deeming Blade Runner great is how slowly paced it is. I'm all for a neo-noir crime thriller to take its time in solving the case, but the down to earth maturity makes the film feel more hollow than if it was more action packed. Also, despite being interesting in theory, Rachel isn't really given enough screen time to be as memorable as she could have been, and whenever she does show up, it usually just has to do with her coming to an emotional resonance around Deckard (not helped by an unsettling and unnecessary implied romance). Not to mention, by the time the movie gets to the third act in resolving the crime case, it just ends off in a standard suspenseful shoot 'em up, not uncommon in other crime flicks. Finally, because there are so many cuts of the movie, you may end up with a different view depending on which one you watch. Granted, it was nice to view the final cut, but when the theatrical cut has a happy ending that is tonally disconnected from the film's intended tone, that will just leave more to be desired than satisfied.So all in all, while Blade Runner might not be a personal favorite, even I can't deny the amazing impact it left on cinema. Had it not been for its underground status that led it to being hailed as a classic, we wouldn't have other innovative sci-fi media like Battlestar Galactica, Akira, Ghost in the Shell, Deus Ex, etc. Seeing as how the film eventually spawned its own sequel made more than 30 years after its original release, its legacy lives on for new generations to come. Faithful to Dick's work or not, all of the films moments in history will never be lost to time, like tears in rain.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Like Tears in the Rain,"After ""Alien"" became a global success, its director Ridley Scott was eager to do more sci-fi. He started on the blockbuster ""Dune"" but was forced to leave the production after a disagreement with its Italian producer. Instead, Scott planned to film ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" by cult writer Philip K Dick. If the director thought he was in for an easier job this time, he must have been disappointed.The movie follows a retired police officer (a so-called Blade Runner) who hunts down rogue androids who have illegally entered Earth.""Blade Runner"", as the film was renamed, became an unusually grueling affair. There are countless reports of the many on-set bad feelings that plagued the production. The star, Harrison Ford, didn't like his co-star Sean Young, and the film crew had T-shirts made to express their anger over the brutal shooting schedule. But the worst part was that Harrison Ford and Ridley Scott didn't get along. Ford has rarely commented on the matter since filming was completed, except to remark that it was the toughest movie he had ever worked on.Ridley Scott credits the French magazine ""Métal Hurlant"" as a stylistic mood source. Inspiration also came from the industrial landscape of his former hometown in northeast England. In addition, the picture has many similarities with Fritz Lang's masterpiece ""Metropolis"". In fact, Scott's effects supervisor used stills from the old silent movie when lining up the miniature building shots of ""Blade Runner"".With its mix of high tech and film noir, ""Blade Runner"" became a box office flop upon its initial run. But the picture soon gained a significant cult following that increased its stature. Today, it is often ranked as one of the most important and influential science fiction movies of all time. Along with William Gibson's novel ""Neuromancer"" the film is regarded as the initiator of the whole cyberpunk genre.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Interesting idea but weak execution,"I watched this movie in November 2019 which, ironically enough, is when the movie takes place. The idea of the movie is interesting, especially for the time that the movie was made (1980), artificial intelligence that looks exactly like humans and are even behaving like them (wanting to live more, starting to develop emotions and not wanting to die). However this movie felt so slow and you don't feel anything for any of the characters. I wanted to like Deckard (Harrison Ford) but he was just so plain and boring. The replicants, on the other hand, feel scary and dangerous but when they confront deckard they pretty much let him kill them so easily which felt weird for me. This movie just wasnt for me.

Time to Try,"When I first saw Blade Runner I was unsure if I actually enjoyed it. It left me unsettled. The slower pace and moody content weren't what I was used to. It isn't a regular Hollywood blockbuster film. Then I let it sink in, and I realised that it was phenomenal, and I had to watch it again, and again, and again.The first version that I watched was the one featuring Deckard's voice-over, Rick Deckard being the world-weary detective played by a smooth Harrison Ford, which is not favoured by film purists, but works for me as it links it to the film noir genre. The version without the voice-over is just as good, but it does fill in some richer details and lends the proceedings more of a hard-boiled feel.Mention must be made of the scintillating Vangelis soundtrack, the use of the electronic instruments clashing with the natural orchestral score mirroring the struggle between natural and synthetic life in the film.The look of Blade Runner is magnificent, owing a large debt to graphic artist Moebius and to the Futurist artistic movement. Blade Runner contains a stunning depiction of a living, breathing near-future - but is any of it real? We know early on that Rachael, the cool Sean Young, is not human, but a Replicant, or synthesised robotic cyborg, known as skin jobs to the less than sensitive police clientele. Yet are the Replicants, who witness things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion¦ C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time¦ like tears in rain¦, which is one of the most beautiful speeches in the history of cinema, are they perhaps more real than the seedy cops who live in squalid hovels and question suspects in smoky offices? Blade Runner gives us a near perfect vision of a dystopian future that has not been bettered. From the flashing, pixellated advertising billboards, through the neon sign-decked side streets, with their market stalls selling ersatz animals and vat-grown human organs as created by the Tyrell Corporation, up to the skies filled with flying vehicles and flaming smokestacks, each enthralling element is skilfully crafted and put on display for us to gawp wild-eyed and open-mouthed at.As Deckard tracks down four rebel Replicants, their leader Roy Batty, given an exuberant performance by Rutger Hauer, he becomes uncertain about the task he has been handed, but has to see it through, or die in the process.The film, in its Directors Cut, also manages to achieve the astounding feat of turning reality inside out in your head, flipping the world on its axis in a highly disorientating way.

Futurama!,"After his Alien success and it was a 1979 revelation in movie special effects, Ridley Scott turns it up another notch to show us what 2019 LA might look like. The art direction is spectacular all right. The concept, which influenced every sci-fi after: mix futuristic fantasy with retro 1930's Fascist architecture, and turn on the strobe lights and fog machine. Give the actors a bag lady wardrobe and a flying car with DeLorean gull wing doors: That's the future kids, well, sort off. The 1979 take on future communications, a phone booth with a TV screen, ha ha  no cell phones envisioned.Harrison Ford could give a Sam Spade Futurama performance back then. Today he sleepwalks through his lines. I have never seen a cocky actor disintegrate over time as Ford has declined.

What A Great Film Concept,"Extraterrestrial robots return to earth in search of their ""maker"", in an effort to extend their preset four-year life span. Lots to think about and ponder. Can robots achieve self-awareness? Are humans merely self-aware robots? Are thoughts and feelings programmable?But ""Blade Runner"", to me, is only partially satisfying. So much of the film, which is generally fast paced, is saturated with unnecessary objects and images that are almost constantly in motion. All of which translates into a kaleidoscope of hubbub and visual overload that I found irritating. Also, the violence, especially in the Rutger Hauer character, is off-putting. Given the film's clever premise, I would have thought the screenwriters could have devised a more futuristic way to express conflict.On the other hand, the film does a good job of describing a future that is truly bleak. In the year 2019, the rich and powerful have fled earth, leaving only the poor and oppressed to endure a post-apocalyptic urban wasteland of gritty neon, dense atmospheric smog, and constant rain. The film's noirish lighting, combined with its cultural ambiguity, and strange sound effects (especially the use of echoes), effectively convey a mood of despair and helplessness. And the music by Vangelis is both beautiful and chilling, and adds to the overall bleakness.""Blade Runner"" is based on a really good premise. And some of the dialogue is fairly profound. But the over emphasis on special effects, cinematography, and sets dilutes the film's philosophical import. While most viewers probably prefer the razzle-dazzle visuals, I would have preferred some restraint in production, with a corresponding expansion of the implications inherent in the underlying concept.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
I need to read genre tags,"This is also not really an action film, silly me. Anyways, this sci-fi drama/crime thriller is pretty good with some great effects and a wild performance by Rutger Hauer as the villain. Harrison Ford is pretty good in the lead, but if you've seen him in one thing you've pretty much seen his whole repertoire, though he looks a little more scared in this one than as Han Solo or Indiana Jones or such. Like my previously reviewed Gattaca, it doesn't delve too deep into the ""what makes a human"" question as I think it could have, and the third act Terminator sequence maybe goes on a little too long, but it's impact has been strong and it is pretty good cyberpunk sci-fi.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Rutger Hauer's (sic) performance burns in your mind long after the final credits run. His villain (if you can call him a villain) is one of the most memorable in movie history. Obviously the medium is the message when you're discussing BladeRunner. The look, the sound and its style brands your cerebral cortex with memories you'll never forget.

Final Cut Review,"In a cyberpunk vision of the future, man has developed the technology to create replicants, human clones used to serve in the colonies outside Earth but with fixed lifespans. In Los Angeles, 2019, Deckard is a Blade Runner, a cop who specializes in terminating replicants. Originally in retirement, he is forced to re-enter the force when six replicants escape from an offworld colony to Earth.I watched this movie with an expectation. A high expectation. A really high one. I heard such words like ""classic,"" ""amazing,"" and ""brilliant."" I also watched this movie with a mindset. In my mind, I intended this film to be an action thriller type of film. Well, when I saw the movie, I hated it.It's probably those two reasons why I didn't like it. I found it so dull, boring, and slow-paced -- really not what I have intended in mind. The whole film felt like an art piece instead of a movie. It's like a BS message type film, as if it was ""robots have feelings too"" type of message.This film isn't for everyone. You'll either love it or hate it and I really hated it. Some will admire it as an excellent piece of art while others will hate it for not explaining much and leaving everything ambiguous and opened. Well, I will praise this film for the excellent look and visual effects, but that's about it. I really did not get what the point of the film was. It went all over the place.Harrison Ford's performance was also a let down. Expecting this to be an action film, I expected Ford to be an action hero, as he is always portrayed in action films he starred in. However, his character in here is old, retired, and just not into anymore action. Sheesh! Watch it if you want to but I will say that people who would like to see a film that has a resolution in the end with a coherent story to not expect much from this.

The number one movie I always say when someone asks me which movie is my number one favorite movie of all time.,"The number one movie I always say when someone asks me which movie is my number one favorite movie of all time.I am a film director and always avoid answering which movie is my 'number one favorite of all time' when my friends ask me.
The answer is complicated because I started to appreciate more and more movies out of different reasons, and it is not a competition. It would be insincere to choose only one, so you can always make a list of movies that inspired you out of different reasons, and from different perspectives.
Maybe the best answers would be the movies you love from your childhood.
Blade Runner survives all the filters and for me it became an easy answer.
The number one favorite movie of all time for me in fact is Blade Runner and I will never change that answer, without any further explanation.Blade Runner inspires me and the favorite scene and quote unquestionably is:
I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate.

As everyone knows already this films stars Harrison Ford, Sean Young and the late Rutgar Hauer who steals every scene he is in and masters possibly my favourite villain of all time that of Roy Batty and one of my favourite scenes of all time in tears in the rain. This is such a deep movie with incredible visuals and a gripping story that intrigues me from scene one and still does after multiple viewings.

"Great atmosphere, visually groundbreaking, little plot, very slow","The movie setting reminds me of a crossover between a monster flick and a futuristic film noir. The world of Blade Runner looks incredibly atmospheric and it's totally convincing: Dark, lived in, gritty, dirty, mysterious, hostile. I wish modern movies would be more like this - not CGI built worlds that feel sterile and are forgettable!The two weaknesses of this movie are the slow pacing and Ford's performance. I'll elaborate in a second. Even if you consider it to be a thriller, the few action scenes only drive the movie slowly and tension is not built up as focused as in Scott's Alien. The movie takes almost 2 hours but we learn almost nothing about the characters. Some might argue this is OK since the replicants don't have the past like humans and also miserable Deckard (even if you don't subscribe to Scott's claim that he was intended to be a replicant) lacks a bit of humanity.It is worth noting that your viewing experience might suffer from picking a ""bad"" version of the movie. There seems to be a consensus that the Final Cut is probably the best choice. On paper the voice-over of Harrison Ford might have been a good idea as it could clear some confusions of viewers and also it gives the movie another film noir touch. But allegedly Ford disagreed and tried to intentionally sabotage the decision with a horrible voice-over performance. Apart from that Harrison Ford is not bad in this movie but not great either. The smirky Han Solo face he sometimes puts on is a bit misplaced for Deckard's character. And of course, Rutger Hauer steals the show!",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Atmopsheric but thin plot & character development,"Blade Runner is a decent atmospheric movie with good music.

Neither the plot for the hunt nor the plot for their survival are very well developed or captivating. Another big aspect is character development which is fairly poor for this movie.The movie does raise some interesting questions about existence so I can see a type of viewer getting excited about it and giving it a good rating.

"A magnificent work, if we consider the time when it was released and the technical resources that existed.","Honestly, I didn't expect much from this movie. It was a film that was not successful in theaters and that only took off when it went to VHS, acquiring admirers since then and becoming one of the most respected films of all time. Set in a profoundly dystopian Los Angeles, it raises many philosophical and sociological questions around human nature, the course of humanity, our relationship with technology and our morality in general.Watching this film in 2022 was funny because the action of the film, released in 1982, takes place in the year 2019. That is, it was set in a future that, now, is past for me and never materialized (and I'm glad). The film's plot is not easy: humanity colonized other planets while destroying Earth, and created very realistic human androids while destroying itself. However, the androids, called replicants, got out of control, and are now hunted and killed, or used for the most vile purposes. The metaphors are clear, there is a lot of philosophical material, and it leaves us thinking for a long time.Ridley Scott gives us, with this film, one of his masterpieces. The film is magnificent in every way, and it is worth giving it the time it needs to surprise us. It creates a neo-noir plot where nobody is innocent or angelic, and where danger is everywhere. The lighting, the shutters on the windows, the indispensable ""femme fatale"", all the classic components of noir are here, in a frankly colorful film with sets and landscapes that combine the most grandiose futurism with the decadence and dirt of the world we destroy. The dialogues are memorable and full of deeply symbolic moments. The characters are rich, dense and complex, and it's extraordinary to think that we still don't really understand, after several decades, whether the main character is human or not.In fact, it seems that time has not passed for this film: if we think that it is from the early 80s, it is incredible that it is so visually powerful and that it has such good cinematography. It looks like a movie made ten years ago. The sets and costumes couldn't be better, and the special effects are stunning. The soundtrack, composed by Vangelis, is smooth and hypnotic.Adding to all this, we have Harrison Ford, in one of the most underrated works of his career. He does a really good job, and he deserved more recognition for that. Sean Young also deserves a round of applause for the way he brought his character to life, a replicant who really thinks she's human. There are other very good actors, and we can highlight Rutger Hauer in particular, but they do not match this duo of artists.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Superb realistic futuristic story,"The film Blade Runner set in the future of earth and is about a cop, played by Harisson Ford a great actor for this role, commanded by the Police to find 5 Replicas. A intresting concept, but its not the story which make the film so speciell and awsome. Dont get me wrong the story is decent and its perfect for the films envoirment. But I really loved the sorroundings and how realistic it is, Its not like any other futuristic film which have flying cars or any other too futuristic props. No Blade Runner shows how the future have studied robots and how the worlds different culture, Japan, german, American, etc, have grown togheter and how the growth of People on earth. I also love the buildings and their textures in this movie and the old style they have. Especielly Sebastianns house. And how they have made the envoirment blend in so realistic is just amazing, and it doesnt look to futurestic, love the haze and the rain, which really make an cozy and a dream like feeling.Anyhow the story-LINE is also very masterful created and exicuted, with so many elements, and still making it work. It just so simple but genius at the same time, Its really good how they dropped a little love and romance to the film, with not at all destroying the other story just impeoving the whole movie and provides a great ending.The films message is not so hurtful and big like in anyother movies Ive seen lately, it just so blends in and flow with the story. Its totally amazing. Like the Replicans just wanted to live and asked their self the question everybody asks their self. Harrisons last words to on the roof is just too great. And one thing I also had to note is that these robots or Replicans is not drasticly over powered like in other movies, and their not annoying their just a perfect Replicas of the human race. And that is what Ive talked about earlier, how realistic, if you can say so, The film is.So absolutly best sci-fi movie Ive whatched and can express of perfect it really is.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The worst sci-fi of all time.,"Blade Runner has been hailed as a true classic, though when it came out it was blasted at the box office.

I found it far too complex but even then I still wouldn't like it. I found it very depressing, overlong and tedious with just endless talking.Though I did like the story from what I could discern from it and Harrison Ford's acting is commendable, but even he couldn't save this.

A Futuristic Dystopian Metaphor of Biblical Representations,"Is there a movie that explores the definition of what it means to be human and ""otherness"" better than Blade Runner? The Tyrell Corporation's motto, ""more human than human,"" serves as the basis for exploring this experience through true humans and created humans, or Replicants. Symbolism of the meaning of humanity in contrast with ""otherness"" are woven throughout the film, relying largely on biblical metaphors. The movie presents us with types of angels, demons, Heaven and God as the creator as well as illusions to Christ, much like the theme and symbolisms use in the film The Life of Pi.The replicants represent the fallen angels in the Bible, or demons. Numerous passages relate the angels as servants to the followers of God, but these angels/replicants fell from grace when they mutinied against their creators. Likewise, the demons of the Bible are angels that fell from God's grace and were cast out of Heaven when they rebelled against God's authority. A powerful symbol that recurs throughout the movie is that of the eye. The Bible uses the illustration of the eyes many times to show its importance as a gate to the soul. Jesus says in the Gospel of Matthew, ""The light of the body is the eye.""Retired cop, Rick Deckard, played by Harrison Ford, is forced out of retirement to resume his position as a Blade Runner. His mission is to ""retire"" or eliminate the four Replicants that have escaped from off-world colonies and have made their way to earth to meet the man who created them and to find the answer to every lasting life. The Replicants or ""skin-jobs"" are androids/humanoids were banned from earth and used as slave labor on earth colonies. Due to their intelligence, they are programed to breakdown or ""die"" after four years to prevent them from developing human emotions or feelings.Deckard must battle and destroy the four replicants: Leon Kolwalski (Brion James); Zhora (Joanna Cassidy) the snake lady; Roy Batty( Rutger Hauer) and Roy's girlfriend, Pris (Daryl Hannah). Eldon Tyrell, the creator of the Replicants, asks Deckard to demonstrate the effectiveness of a machine that is used to identify if someone is a replicant or a human. He is asked to perform the test on Tyrell's employee, Rachel. It takes 100 questions before Deckard determines that she is indeed a replicant. She plays a major role in saving Deckard's life during an altercation with Leon Kolwalski.The special effects in Blade Runner are paramount, since they were created by camera and not computer-generated images. The lighting throughout the film, along with the voice-over narration by Deckard, and the shapely, form fitted dresses worn by Rachel, gives us the impression of a dark futuristic film that is reminiscent of a 1940s black and white movie. This effect is well played and lends a bit of mystique to the picture. The opening scene of the Los Angeles skyline reflecting off the iris of an eye is breathing taking and symbolic of God's view of his earthly creation.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The world does not need another review of this extraordinary movie but here goes anyway,"Decker (Harrison Ford) lives in 2019 Los Angeles. He is a mostly retired blade runner, that is, a person who hunts down replicants and eliminates them. Replicants are manufactured human beings that do work on the ""off colonies"" of far space that regular human beings have populated, too. Replicants, who are vital in the colonies, are forbidden to come to planet earth. If they do, they are tracked down and killed. Most of them have superior physical powers but lack problem solving and reasoning skills and have few emotions. Although Decker wants to be retired, a particularly lethal group of replicants manages to come to earth and the big boss police chief makes it clear to Decker that he is needed. Or else. Decker begins to hunt down the four replicants on the loose, just as he meets a lady named Rachel, who may be a replicant, too, and a very pretty one. Is there really a world of difference between humans and replicants? What have we really done to ourselves and our civilization by making these ""almost"" human beings? This is one of the greatest movies of all time. The story is taken from a work by Philip K. Dick and is superior science fiction. Ford embodies the morally confused but determined blade runner very well. The other actors, especially Rutger Hauer and Sean Young, do fine work, too. However, the style of the film is the movie's greatest asset. The seamy modern world that Ridley Scott and his companions have created is beyond wonderful. From the flying transport machines that bark out advertisements to the people below to the decayed buildings from another era, this is a world one has to see to appreciate. If you have never seen this film, don't walk to the nearest video store or library. Run at top speed and wrestle the film out of someone else's hands, if you have to.

these are just comments - but it IS the best film I've ever seen,"So myriads of people have spoken on Blade Runner - most of whom probably have good ideas and are insightful and so on.  If you love the movie, I'm with you, but the damn thing ALWAYS makes me cry; so after about the tenth time I watched it over a 10 year period (I drink when I watch it) I finally realised that besides the very incredible cast, and the interesting story, there was something else swilling around at the bottom of the movie that inevitably made me blub at the end.  Sean Young is gorgeous of course, but so?  The real message of the movie is this: that Deckard [the protaganist], could fall in love with an android - something pretty much against ALL his training.  By the end of the movie we see that people [you, me, the protagonist] can fall in love with anything, just so long as it is able to capture your heart.  It is THE movie that is totally anti-bigot, that strips taboo down to raw emotion and declares ""if your heart WANTS this, you won't be able to stop it"".  It is a movie about forbidden love, taboo, intrigue, death and life: pretty juicy stuff.  And the unspoken message is simply 'people will give their hearts away to whoever will pay their price, and furthermore, they won't be able to help themselves'.  Because, if you remember, ol' Sean is just a machine - an appliance really, a big, complicated vaccuum cleaner with an incredibly great face, but still a machine; just a machine.  And to prove the point, there he is, the android Roy Batty who in the end loved life so much that he would not even take the life of his would-be killer.  It's THAT message about the individual: that the Nazi can fall in love with the beautiful Jewish chick; that the militant black guy can be transfixed by the innocent white girl; that the boundaries of race or creed or color, or even of flesh and blood, are actually no boundaries at all... that if Deckard can cross them, anybody can. He falls in love with an android, and shows us that no matter how you were trained or raised or brought up, there is the possibility of love... that somewhere in time, even if we are ""sushi"" - even if we are cold fish -  we can love anything, or anyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"Philosophical Quandaries in a Dazzling, Atmospheric Future Cityscape","In the far-off landscape of 2019, the Earth has advanced to a technological zenith. Now truly masters of their domain, humanity has reshaped the world in its own self-centered image. Overburdened and sullied with waste, the landscape flickers in neon hues and fluorescent glare. As gas-powered fireballs spit on the horizon and acid rain drips steadily in the streets, our mutual rush to conquer has rendered former essentials like daylight and animal life virtually extinct. Mere victims in the name of progress. That same callous attitude is applied to the artificial workers we employ for physically demanding off-planet work. Dubbed replicants, these synthetic beings are sent to fight our wars and pave the way for new interstellar colonies, but are also hamstrung with an extremely short lifespan and a strict prohibition from visiting Earth. Crucial failsafes, lest they harbor any undesirable thoughts about throwing the yoke.Fresh off the success of 1979's Alien, director Ridley Scott dips a toe in similar waters for this gloomy, epic, long-simmering Philip K. Dick adaptation. Set in an equally dark, lived-in future society, Blade Runner provides a strong tonal match while exploring a very different set of themes and ideas. In this case, we're concerned with the very fabric of conscious thought. Now that the human race has effectively opened Pandora's box and created a manner of life (the replicants), where do we draw the line between their brand of being and our own? Why are their lives considered so much more disposable? It's a rich question, later mirrored in films such as Ghost in the Shell and Ex Machina, and one for which there's no easy answer. Especially when the subjects react so emotionally, resorting to murder, deception and violence when their pleas for emancipation fall on deaf ears. These rebellious replicants don't make for objectively good people, but then, neither does a majority of the human race.Blade Runner is the best kind of science fiction. Morally thoughtful and conceptually ambitious, it puts the audience in a mixed state of awe and discomfort, then leaves us to grapple with the consequences. We're dazzled by the atmosphere of this foreign-yet-familiar scene, but repulsed by the effect it's had on our collective nature.

A timeless gem by Ridley Scott,"Blade Runner is a science fiction movie directed by Ridley Scott and stars Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Edward James Olmos and Joe Turkel.The movie is based in the year 2019.The movie was deeply criticised by the critics at the time of it's release however now considered as cult movie. Maybe because the movie was made way ahead of it's time hence is been one of the finest SciFi movie ever made.Ridley Scott is a master of SciFi movies and Alien and The Martian is the prime example.Acting is strong and special effects are impressive visuals and good. The only drawback of the movie is that the movie is entirely made in dark and this theory is beyond understanding as the sun and sunlight would have been there in 2019. The climax is the best part of the movie and is intelligently written. The screenplay is slow and gets very slow at some scenes and few viewers can get distracted.This is one of the finest science fiction movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
GOOD BUT...,"So based on this movie in one year we would have flying cars!?But first, I don't get why the replicants are considered as bad guys? Why does everyone wants to kill them, while they're just looking to live and they didn't ask to be alive at first place? Still, they ended up showing that they are as human if not more then the 'real humans' themselves especially at the finally. should Definitely give it a rewatch, even if it's a classic am going to be objective, I love the visual concept and its Neo-black aesthetics plus the references to the cyberpunk movement, the director's cut sheds more light on Rick Deckard nature and reinforces the movie's theme and its questioning of human nature although it was slow and full of talking with almost zero action, but its bigger flow is that it lacked a danger factor making some parts boring and hard to follow. even so, it's full of positive points too the main one is the use of music I love and appreciate Vangelis compositions and his use of Arabic music, a sound that added depth something this movie lacked especially in the characters and contrasted the anxious future Rick Deckard lived in, plus giving to this movie its iconic identity and sound.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

A Must See - Science Fiction at it's very best,"The 1991 Director's Cut (The Director's Cut is a lot different than the original theatrical release in 1982) of Ridley Scotts' classic film 'Blade Runner' is, by far, one of the greatest Science-Fiction movies ever made. 'Blade Runner' takes place in the far future where mankind has developed 'Replicants', genetically engineered robotic-human clones. 'Replicants' were designed to be physically superior to humans, but possess the same intelligence as the common human being. These androids are used as slaves for the 'hazardous exploration and colonization' of other planets in our solar system. At some point in time, (which isn't specified in the movie) a violent 'Replicant' revolt ensues on a colonized planet, this event causes replicants to be declared illegal on Earth, if a replicant is found on Earth it will be immediately destroyed. The title of the movie, 'Blade Runner', refers to a policeman whose job it is to shoot and kill any replicants they might find on Earth.(All of this, of course, is explained in the first three minutes of the movie, much clearer, and much shorter, but I decided to write about it anyways)The story is about a man named Rick Deckard (played by Harrison Ford), an experienced 'Blade Runner' who's unwillingly brought out of retirement to finish one last mission. Deckard has to track down four rogue replicants who have escaped from a planetary colony to Earth, killing innocent lives on the way. These four highly dangerous replicants are loose on the streets of L.A., and could kill again unless Deckard can deal with them first.This film isn't the first time in the Sci-Fi genre for Ridley Scott. His previous film in the Science-Fiction genre is 'Alien', which is an extremely well presented Horror film in space. Ridley Scott knows how to establish a mood, in 'Alien' he makes the audience feel clustered, tense, and alone on a gigantic moving spaceship, the same in 'Blade Runner'. Deckard's' chase scene through L.A. in 2019, halfway through the movie, best describes the atmosphere of the film. Medium shots of Deckard running through the streets, culturally diverse extras constantly filling the screen, talking street lights, loud-annoying street sounds, all of the preceding things add up to a perfect feel of a technologically corrupted Los Angeles. The final segments of this chase scene use slow motion, and a very bluesy musical score that gives the scene such finesse that an audience can easily see the horror of what mankind, in the film, has become.The overall presentation of 'Blade Runner' is very much like a gritty 1950's detective movie, with Harrison Ford in a majority of the scenes, becoming the stoic private eye who is fed up with his job. Ford has a knack for playing characters that are down on their luck, because of this he pulls off Rick Deckard's character flawlessly. Ford's calm and collected manner of performing all his actions fit the experienced 'Blade Runner' very well. All the roles in the film are played with great skill by the cast, every supporting performance adds to the magnificence of this film. The creator of the combat 'Replicant' models J.F. Sebastian is a timid scientist who lives with his homemade midget robots. William Sanderson, who plays Sebastian, portrays the shy scientist exactly how one would expect. Joe Turkel plays Tyrell, the owner of a major 'Replicant' producing company called Tyrell Corporation. Turkel also gives a great performance as an arrogant corporate owner. One actor to look out for is Rutger Hauer who plays the leader and most dangerous of the four escaped replicants, Roy Batty. The innocence he gives to the ruthlessly evil character is a scary thing to watch at times. What truly makes 'Blade Runner' a must-see film is its' dialogue, every conversation between characters has an underlying theme within it. One of my favorite lines is when Batty says 'We're not computers  we're physical'. The manner Hauer says it will get the viewer thinking. The writing also shines at the end with Roy's last lines in the film, overall a very moving script with a ton of different conversations that are worth listening to.From the opening scenes of a horribly industrialized Los Angeles, to the chase on L.A.'s crowded streets, and finally the gruesome fight scene which concludes the movie, 'Blade Runner' is one of the breakthrough films in the Sci-Fi genre. This movie is a non-stop journey through a very realistic rendition of the future. The thing to watch out with this movie is also considered to be a Film-Noir. This means that certain characteristics will constantly take shape in the film. For example a Film-Noir will only promote the cynical side of human nature, thus the genre 'Film-Noir' is a very ugly look at life. Many factors in 'Blade Runner' add up to a classification of Film-Noir some of them are: - Deckard's primary job is hunting and killing androids, not a very joyous job. Deckard himself has a very cynical way of saying things. - L.A. is portrayed as a city overrun by smoke and fog. The exterior shots of the city usually incorporate rain. Many scenes take places in dark, gloomy, and empty streets. - As you watch the film you will notice that bright colors are rarely used and the city streets are in constant darkness(because of the pollution blocking the sun).Film-Noirs are often filled with ambiguity and the protagonist is usually a depressing kind of guy. This might discourage people from watching it, but I highly recommend picking 'Blade Runner' up at the video store just to see at least one Film-Noir in your lifetime. This genre is one of those things that you either love or you hate, a proper Film-Noir will usually not have a picture perfect ending so don't expect one from 'Blade Runner' (at least the Director's Cut anyways).It is a highly overlooked film nowadays, when the common movie-goer thinks of Sci-Fi immediately big name titles like: The Star Wars Saga, Star Trek, The Matrix Trilogy, The Terminator, etc. are what they would think of. Blade Runner is the true definition of the Sci-Fi genre; it doesn't have the fun and games of Star Wars, or the huge firefight scenes of the Matrix, but delivers thoughts on what it means to live, what our future holds, and a serious outlook on humans in general.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A turning point in science-fiction,"Ridley Scott's Blade Runner has had such a profound affect on the science-fiction genre across every medium that we are still seeing imitators today. If the opening shot of the dark, futuristic landscape of 2019 Los Angeles seems at all familiar, it's either because you've witnessed this cinematic masterpiece before, or seen an ill-fated attempt to recreate this grim, claustrophobic future elsewhere. Blade Runner's classic status now seems almost ironic, given the film's disastrous reception upon its original release, and the countless different versions released since. Among others, there was the original 'workprint prototype', the U.S. theatrical cut, the international theatrical cut, the broadcast version, and The Director's Cut. I think most would agree with me when I say the 'Final Cut' is the definitive version, trimmed of Harrison Ford's rambling narration and the tacked-on happy ending that borrowed unused footage from Stanley Kubrick's The Shining.In the future, the Tyrell Corporation has manufactured bioengineered humans known as Replicants, commonly used for slave labour off-Earth. Granted the intelligence of their makers, the Replicants tend to start questioning their purpose, often resulting in mutiny and violence. To counter this, Tyrell has limited their lifespan to four years in the hope that they will die before such thoughts can even enter their mind. However, four Replicants (Rutger Hauer's leader Roy Batty, Daryl Hannah's Pris, Brion James' Leon and Joanna Cassidy's Zhora) have rebelled against their masters and made it back to Earth. It is the job of 'Blade Runner' Rick Deckard (Ford) to hunt the foursome down and 'retire' them before they can cause any real damage. Deckard questions the morality of his job, especially when he meets Tyrell's latest creation, the stunning Rachael (Sean Young), a Replicant who isn't aware of what she is.Blade Runner is simply astonishing on a number of levels. When Vangelis' score - a majestic combination of the classical and synthesised - kicks in early on, Scott's film becomes an experience on a whole other plain. The production design, which is a noir-ish hybrid of choking, rainy streets and golden interiors blackened by shadows, had never been seen before and hasn't been so effectively moulded since. This feels like a wholly tangible future, lived-in and almost familiar, and although we may not have flying cars, super-beings crafted by science or Atari as a thriving corporation, the future depicted in Blade Runner isn't much different to the world we live in today. The sets, special effects, music and editing are all combined by Scott to create a world we can almost touch. The fleeting moments of violence, something the film was criticised for on its original release, are fast, shocking and ugly. There's a scene in which a death occurs in slow-motion through various panes of glass which is almost beautiful to behold, but even this plays out with an air of tragedy. The line between good and bad is certainly blurred here.I haven't read Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick, but common opinion is that Blade Runner eclipses its source and then some. It's the stuff of dreams for science-fiction aficionados, going way beyond its thriller premise to touch on some big philosophical questions and ponder the very definition of being human. Hauer's masterful portrayal of Batty ends with a monologue improvised by the actor, and his speech is one the most memorable and quoted pieces of dialogue in cinema history for good reason. It is moving and stirring and will catch you off guard, forcing you to reflect on everything you have just seen for days after. Ford is impressive too, downplaying the goofy charisma of Han Solo and Indiana Jones and growing into the beaten-down, conflicted bounty hunter. But the real star here is Ridley Scott himself, who has never made a finer film, crafting a landscape that would go on to be the go-to aesthetic for dystopian futures. It would take either a stupid or unnervingly brave director to make a follow-up, but if any director has the ability to expand this universe into something even more spectacular, it's Denis Villeneuve.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"""All those moments will be lost in time like tears in rain""","""Blade Runner"" is one of the ultimate sci-fi/cult movies of all time and right up there as one of my very favorite films. The atmosphere is wonderfully consistent and really draws you in. As with Ridley Scott films in general the camera work and visuals are superb (the scene where Deckard runs a VoidCom test on Sean Young's replicant, and the window gradually turns opaque springs to mind). The effects still look great, remarkable considering the film is now more than twenty years old.The film looks better than ever here, with the re-mastered picture and sound quality and the very subtle use of CGI to clear up things like out-of-sync dialog, support wires on the spinners and the obvious stunt-double for Joanna Cassidy's character Zhora; all helping to maintain the endless feeling of plausibility that the world of Blade Runner presents. The only new addition that seemed slightly strange to me was in clearing up the original confusion as to how many replicants were actually missing. Much of the film's mystique revolves around the central question as to whether or not Deckard is, in fact, a replicant; a theory that initially came about due to a dubbing error during Deckard's briefing with Captain Bryant. Given that Scott has been one of the most vocal supporters of this theory, it seems odd to me that he would correct this line of dialog in such a way that destroys any real mystery surrounding the ""Deckard as replicant"" debate. There are so many layers to Blade Runner and so many things that can be said from the brilliant look of the newly restored cut, the awesome remixed sound, the Original Score by Vangelis, and the story itself. Without question, Blade Runner is a significant work of science-fiction cinema that manages to overcome any such flaws in character or narrative to take us on a trip into a world far beyond anything we've ever seen before.Overall rating: 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Another thing I enjoyed was watching a movie where Harrison Ford is the main character but not the best actor, that I feel goes to Rutger Hauer. Rutger was absolutely amazing, his ending monologue almost brought tears to my eyes.

"A technical masterpiece that makes you think, but isn't that exciting to watch.","Ridley Scott's Blade Runner is a dark science fiction film that doesn't follow the usual narrative you would expect. It takes its time to play out and brings up many philosophical questions. Blade Runner is a visual and technical masterpiece but is not a very lively film that keeps you engaged and drags from beginning to end.The plot follows Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) as a blade runner in 2019. Blade runners are the police that specialize in hunting and eliminating android look-alikes of humans known as Replicants. Four replicants have escaped from an off-world colony and have come back to Earth and Deckard is tasked with eliminating them. Since replicants are perfect copies of humans, hunting them down is a very difficult process. This makes the audience question which characters are human and which are replicant. The film follows a police mystery narrative where the protagonist has to track down the bad guys using evidence and intellect. We follow Deckard along as he travels around 2019 Los Angeles trying to find each individual replicant.The biggest problem with the film is its pacing. It is very slow at setting up the story and keeping the mystery alive. It feels much longer than its 117-minute runtime. The film speeds to a medium pace once Deckard finds his first Replicant, but it's too little too late. Having a slow film allows Scott to build a world around Deckard's story. Every detail and supporting fact has its own backstory and is open to more exploration. I expect Denis Villeneuve's sequel to dive further and revisit the same questions.The most important element of the film is its ability to raise valuable and complex questions about humanity. We know exactly which characters are replicants, but we never know the background stories of the human characters. We just assume they're human, but never really know who they are and their motivations.Having these questions distances the film from other sci-fi films of the 80's. It feels that this film was intended for people tired of the usual sci-fi films that follow Star Wars model where the characters are either good or evil and the audience is kept entertained with action and adventure. Scott has taken that trope and flipped it the other way around, creating a dark, dystopian film where every character has different questionable personal motives and isn't labeled as good or evil.The biggest aspect of the film is the technical work behind the scenes that make the world feel more real and lively. The visual effects are masterful for the time period and still look quite good thirty-five years later. The large urban setting completely surrounds the small characters and enhances the dystopian setting.Another minor problem with the film is the acting. Harrison Ford does an alright job as the hard and almost lifeless cop Rick Deckard. Rutger Hauer is the only highlight as the lead replicant, Roy. His character is never made into a clear villain and we end up feeling sorry for him as he searches for purpose in his short life. There is nothing special or memorable about the other characters.With the sequel, Blade Runner 2049, arriving next week, moviegoers should make it a mission to watch this to get a feel for what to expect. This is not the usual sci-fi action film that you most likely grew up on and I expect the sequel to follow that same trend. You'll most likely get more enjoyment researching this film and thinking about it rather than actually watching it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
*Yawns*,"Who knew a film named ""Blade Runner"", a movie with such high praise, could be so boring. TBH, I stopped paying attention halfway though, and surfed the web on my phone. Blade Runner's lone quality is it looks great. As with Alien, it does everything a sci-fi movie should do. Its dark, its detailed, and shows off the culture and technology.Other than that? As an action film, its abysmally paced, with no special scenes or charismatic characters. As a ""deep, philosophical"" film...I don't buy it. You can't support your themes without strong characters. And Blade Runner's entire cast is uninteresting. It may have been intentional for them to be lifeless and robotic, but this movie didn't make me care about machines. Why even bother answering the questions this movie supposedly asks? ""Is genetic engineering ethical? What makes us human?"" Who cares? I don't care anymore after this film than I did before.The noir romantic relationship had zero impact on me. Just as typical and shallow as any other relationship from the genre. But I suppose its okay, since Scott meant to do that. *eye rolls* Its another sci-fi classic that seems like it can get away with anything if its shot well and merely mentions its themes.

"""...a foreskin-job"" --I mean-- ""FOUR SKIN-JOBS""...","This is an interesting film. Dark- possibly. It's no ""Star Wars"" or ""Indiana Jones"", and I think that so many people were expecting just that in 1982 when released. I was in 5th grade, and it was the first R-rated flick that I saw in a theatre, and I was amazed at what I saw. First, I wasn't expecting the usual bulls***-summer movie, so what was shown was a precursor to what the not-so-distant future had in store. I don't think audiences from the Y generation will much like this with their limited attention-spans. But it's astonishing with how many of Scott's ""future"" premonitions have come true: corporations owning the world; the increase of the Asian population in Los Angeles; flying police cars-- oh, maybe not that one...I just looked at this last night on DVD, and I miss the original cut. Ford's voice-over wasn't that bad. It was well-written. And I found myself reciting that missing voice-over when watching the scenes that the VO was once present. But without the voice-over, there is a surreal effect to it. It seems more eerie. And the original ending wasn't a ""pat-Hollywood ending""-- just gave it some resolution, that's all. The new ending looks like a foreign film's. Not bad, but not all that good either.I think that this movie's got such a tight following because it wasn't real popular and was in fact shunned ny the critics when released. The ingredients of a cult classic! But I do not think that this was a great film, either. For one thing, Scott focuses more on the visuals and the sets rather than character development & story (something that Lucas is obsessed with in the new 'Star Wars' films). But the acting isn't bad-- Rutger Hauer is one weird-ass guy! Brion James is a true stupid replicant thug, and Daryl Hannah is great as the ""little replicant lost"" role. Joanna Cassidy is as smart as Hauer (but not anywhere near as strange) & sexy. Harrison Ford is different in every movie he's in, although he tends to overact (but never over the top) at times.

Lovely to look at....that's it.,"'Blade Runner' may be the most over rated film of 1982. It is lovely to look at, and all without the use of CGI. The Tyrell Building is a real eye opener. The rain washed streets, the colours and shadows, the flying cars and the floating advertisement craft, the light lancing through broken rooves, the smashing of glass and so forth. It all looks great. It is a truly realised environment.Within this is a story as thin as a blade but without any bite. The director's cut without the noir-ish voice over is hardly any better. Harrison Ford is an ordinary actor and his performance here is dull. He is overwhelmed by the scenery. It is Han Solo re-cycled and doesn't convince for a minute.There are excellent actors in it but have very underdeveloped roles. Interesting actors like Edward James Olmos. M Emmet Walsh, Joanna Cassidy and Joe Turkel are wasted. Rutger Hauer is splendid however and gives a powerful and oddly touching performance. To see his film decline the way it did was sad to see.

Rutger Hauer's performance was incredibly powerful in particular his final words as his life came to it's engineered end: ""I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched c-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to die."" If you haven't seen Rutger in this scene look it up on the internet, better yet see the film!

In no way does it deserve eight (eight!) stars, three max., maybe for being something new at the time and for the not too awful acting.I'd recommend this only to those who want to feel like they'd spend the time watching this movie better if they stared at a wall for two hours straight.

Solid Blend of Sci-Fi and Neo-Noir,"What is interesting here is that this is my second time watching this film in less than a year, when it took me 35 years to watch it for the first time. My original viewing was for a podcast that was asking for reviews of where to begin with Film-Noir and Neo Noir films. This falling in the latter of course. What is interesting for me though, I love Science Fiction so I'm not sure why I put this off for so long.For my first watch, I thought this was well-made, but I think finer points were missed. Having now given this a second watch, I'm seeing why it is considered a classic. I'll be honest, I was a bit tired and I was lost in the visuals. It is this second watch that opened my eyes to more of what is under the surface here.There is a classic noir mystery here. Deckard (Harrison Ford) is a retired cop that is called back in by Bryant (M. Emmet Walsh) to hunt down 4 replicants. These are the most androids made to date that have gone rogue and killed people in the process. He needs to find them and knowing why they came to Earth is part of it.It is this watch that I realize their existence is said. Due to how advanced they are in learning; they were only given a 4-year life span. That is approaching. Batty (Ruger Hauer) is their leader and he wants to extend their life. This brings him to Chew (James Hong), J. F. Sebastian (William Sanderson) and their maker, Tyrell (Joe Turkel). There is a profound look at religion in a way of going to God to help fix a problem. You could even look at this as God having turned his back and refusing to help as well.There's also another aspect. Deckard meets with Tyrell to start his investigation. A test is given to Rachael (Sean Young) who turns out to be more advanced than I think Batty's crew. She doesn't know she is a replicant. There is things I picked up this time around that the eyes of these androids have red pupils when the light hits them right. I noticed something this time around with Deckard and it made me think something about him as well. It would explain why he's so good.We have outdated CGI here, but there's charm to it. It made me laugh that this takes place in 2019. The world is nowhere near this advanced, but I love that is what they thought. The acting is great across the board. Ridley Scott has amazing shots here where you lose yourself. It is set in the future, but it could also be in the 1950s with the mystery we are seeing. That makes it feel timeless and I appreciate that. One that now seeing it a second time, my rating has come up. I wouldn't be shocked if it goes up again with another watch. I've now seen Final Cut twice, I believe, so the next time will be another version. One that I would recommend watching if you like mysteries or sci-fi films.My Rating: 8.5 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
I can see why everyone loves this movie,"I watched this movie for the first time not too long ago and at first I didn't know what to think of it. It seems like a straight forward crime noir story, but it takes that concept and turns it into so much more. The film constantly (although subtly) calling into question Deckard's true identity. It seems very apparent as the film goes on what the true answer is, but it is never fully addressed. That is the genius of this film. It has so much hidden subtext in it. I love this film and like Ridley Scott's other work Alien, it is a Masterpiece and a movie that will go down in history as one of the greatest stories ever told through film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

A timeless technical masterpiece,"At this point there's really very little room for debate about the artistic merits of Ridley Scott's 'Blade Runner'. Aside from 'Star Wars' and '2001', it may be the most influential science fiction film of all-time. Not a hit with either critics or audiences back in 1982, today it sits near the top of dozens of ""Best of"" polls. The one remaining question is; beyond its technical and artistic merits, is 'Blade Runner' a great film? The answer is, or at least my answer is, almost.Is it a bit cold and emotionless? Yes, but that's its tone not a flaw. Is it a bit confusing? For certain, but sci-fi of this type rarely spoon-feeds you every last detail. There are dozens of ways to interpret this film. A sure sign of good storytelling.The story is strong, the script tight and the performances exactly what they need to be. In short, 'Blade Runner' is more than just a pretty face.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A significant sci-fi film that holds a mirror up to humanity and forces us to ask some uncomfortable questions about ourselves,"A significant sci-fi film that holds a mirror up to humanity and forces us to ask some uncomfortable questions about ourselvesBlade Runner is an adaptation of Philip K. Dick's 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?Blade Runner was rather a commercial failure, only just managing to recoup its $28 million costs. Also, initial critical reaction to the film was somewhat negative. In light of Ridley Scott and Harrison Ford's previous films, it is not surprising that public expectations were not fulfilled when confronted with what seemed to be a noir-style dark depressing vision of the future as opposed to an action-packed visual effects sci-fi feast.Over time, initial assessments of Blade Runner have become more favourable to the extent that the film has acquired a cult status, and is one of only 50 films to be stored in the United States Library of Congress, on the basis of its contribution to film culture.A wonderful aspect of the film for me is the way in which the characters come across as being complex and multi-faceted as opposed to the kind of one-dimensional characters we often find in sci-fi films.The more you watch the film the more you see until you find yourself almost falling down a rabbit hole of possible motifs, symbolism, themes and connections. Consider for instance, the moral issues surrounding the treatment of replicants in the film. These are beings designed by humans specifically to serve humans. In many ways they are viewed as little more than disposable objects, despite the fact that there is little that can distinguish them from humans and the fact that they are complex beings possessing emotions. Memories and desires. Humans have created replicants in their own image. Should they then subject them to slavery and oppression and 'retire' them when they become obsolete or don't perform in the way we want them to? Do entities like replicants have the right to resist being oppressed even to the extent of taking human life? What rights should they have? As with Frankenstein's monster, the creator will be forced to take responsibility for his creation.....or suffer the consequences.That last question concerning the possible rights that entities like the replicants ought to have, raises another theme that is explored in Blade Runner, that of identity. What does it mean to be human in a world where the distinctions between artificial replicants and humans seem to be almost non-existent. It is suggested in the film that much of our identity is largely shaped by our memories. What we experience in life serves to shape our personalities and make us human. If this also applies to replicants, then what distinguishes them from humans?In Blade Runner, the theme of artificial intelligence forms an intrinsic part of the creation of what are essentially sentient beings. This is one aspect of the future we cannot escape and it will raise ethical and moral dilemmas for humanity. Failure to take responsibility may lead our creation to re- evaluate the kind of relationship it has with its creator and it may be forced to do something about it.....",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"'Blade Runner': a brief study in American history, film noir...and music","...Considering the 800+ other comments on this 20th Century-made (and 21st Century 'still enjoyed') Ridley Scott-produced 'future history' story of Philip K. Dick's 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep' vision of the future, I stand amazed this was the one chosen for a film adaptation. Asimov, Clarke, Heinlein, Gifford, Patterson...others, have written reams of sci-fi(?) future history stories, any number of which would produce an enjoyable and intellectually-stimulating celluloid. In defense, however, Dick's tight, concise and mentally-graphic storytelling are the product of specific genius. The fact that director Scott and his 3-D, art-directed team 'got' Dick's vision is testament to adaptability from a great story line for film. In truth, a movie version of any of the aforementioned treatises would have forced a monstrous series of film productions instead of a regular, two-hour viewing conducive to a regular movie-going event (with few exceptions, 'series' often fail to produce box-office monies from the original construct).Having said that, Dick's tough storyline, the resultant and beautiful screen-play, art direction, studio and on-location construction, and Scott's direction, have made 'Blade Runner' a euphoric and time-honored cult classic. The fact that this was Hollywood's last, great effort on an analogue film (no special effects were produced by computer generation - unknown then) bears witness to true 'on-film' making graphical expertise. Cutting-edge, then, and still stands triumphant in spite of its age.In addition - and strongly in merit - the concept of hearkening a film-noir essence from the 30's to exact the nuances of a distopian future history, tied directly to an American republic past, is pure genius. All the un-loosed ends of our civil problems: overpopulation, corporeal greed, castration of civil rights, global pollution...illegal governmental intravention...illegal aliens...are addressed one way or another in this dark, emotionally-charged but lens-clear vision of the multi-cultered American vision of our global future. It's as if the roots of our fatherhood slowly stood within the movie theatre and silently applauded, reckoning a civil duty. A film, and vision, vastly ahead of its time...In any movie, the music 'sets the tone' for its ambiance. Audiences as a whole - and individually - identify the theme of a film from its music. Scott was adroit in his choice of 'Vengelis' (Evangelos Odysseas Papathanassiouas) as the film's music author. A Greek music composer and self-taught musician (he has sold over 20 million albums), Vangelis is 65 years old now, and has understood - inimitably - the essence of film thematic music (he is an absolute 'film buff'). When you listen to his efforts to construct the theme music for this film (see, 2nd disc 'Blade Runner - The Final Cut'), you'll understand his pathos for this movie. One of the ultimate decisions to include this film within my 'All Time' favorites is Evangelos' empathetic and counter-point music, deftly underscoring the harsh realities of the film. It helps soften my stern nightmares of our future...Bob Shank Jr Tucson",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A cyberpunk and mystery sci-fi thriller all in one,It wasn't until my teens that I watched this film. It was a little hard to follow but I got into it and it made me interested in cyberpunk. That's a brand of science-fiction that deals with urban environments and cybernetics and computer technology. Think TV shows like Batman Beyond and games like Deus Ex. But this could very well be the precursor to all those different cyberpunk sagas. Here is the story of a gang of near-human androids known as Replicants who want to live comfortable lives. But not if the LAPD has anything to say about it. Harrison Ford plays a police detective whose job it is to eliminate these near-humans. Can he do it? Will the Replicants claim victory? Is he destined for a quick funeral? You'll have to watch and find out.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

I must say though, it is quite visually impressive for being made before the era of computer animation.  It is also dated by today's standards, despite what people say.  The plot is without a soul.

Blade Runner - A Top Sci-Fi Thriller,"After the Indiana Jones films kicked off with their wildly successful box office receipts, Harrison Ford was now a hot commodity. He wisely chose this film to continue his run of successes on the big screen. This sci-fi film noir is a classic of moody and chilling filmmaking. We are both repelled and attracted to the future that is depicted on the screen. The philosophical aspects of the movie are still with us in this new era of AI social responsibility. Should robots be treated as humans? Are robots actually a new life-form? These and other deep questions are asked in this film and are still being asked in today's world. Rutger Hauer gives a harrowing performance as one of the AI robots, and asks some pretty important questions as well.

This movie is, hands down, one of the most epic and thought-provoking films I've ever seen. I'm giving it a solid 10 out of 10 stars - it's that good!First off, the visuals are absolutely stunning. The special effects are so ahead of its time, it's mind-boggling. The cityscapes, the flying cars, the robots - everything looks so real and immersive. I felt like I was right there in the future with Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford).The storyline is incredibly deep and complex. It's not just some action-packed sci-fi flick; it's actually making you think about what it means to be human. The replicants, these artificial beings that are almost indistinguishable from humans, are seeking longer lifespans and more rights. It's like, what does it mean to be alive, you know?Harrison Ford is absolutely phenomenal as Deckard. He's got this whole tough-guy thing going on, but you can tell he's also got feelings and doubts. And Rutger Hauer as Roy Batty? Forget about it - the guy's a genius. His monologue at the end is, like, whoa.The pacing is perfect, the score is hauntingly beautiful, and the themes are timeless. This movie is a masterpiece, plain and simple. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and watch it ASAP.

"Blade Runner: Final Cut - review, 9/10","Boiled down to the very basics, Blade Runner is a detective story set in a dystopian alternate-future version of Los Angeles. However, the emphasis of the film is not placed on the setting, nor is it placed on the usual trappings of the sci-fi genre (think galactic dogfights or laser battles), instead the focus of the movie falls squarely on one central theme; the nature of humanity - our emotions, our mortality, and our purpose. These themes are elegantly told through the story of a policeman, Deckard, who is tasked with hunting down a group of Replicants (genetically-engineered humans) and it does so with great success.The only shortcoming I can think of for this otherwise stellar movie is the comparatively thin plot, it is clear that it was merely a tool, subservient to the greater aims of the director's vision but this is just a nit-pick as the movie's purpose was to communicate deeper questions of humanity, which it did very effectively at the expense of its detective story.In fact, the plot's subservience to the themes of the movie is what makes this movie stand out, it is well-constructed and inter-connected in almost every aspect. Each facet of the movie's design is in service to the key themes of the movie which keep you intellectually stimulated and emotionally invested throughout the entirety of the runtime, nothing feels superfluous or in need of trimming, the structure of the film was near flawless. The themes were clear, effectively communicated and excellently given voice to by the entire cast, with Rutger Hauer's stand-out performance being particularly haunting, intriguingly sad and profound.As previously mentioned, this movie doesn't rely on the grandiose spectacle that many sci-fi films are wont to employ, but that isn't to say that the film is not visually stunning. Rather, the bombastic spectacle has been substituted for a far more subtle (and far more effective) approach. Visually, the movie strikes a very unique tone, the dirty, poorly-lit scenes result in a sense of unease and anxious turbulence that underscores the entire film, intensified by the uncanny but brilliant soundtrack by Vangelis which had an eerily spiritual ambiance to it. Blade Runner makes great use of its claustrophobic atmosphere, thriving both in moments of tension and contemplation all with a slow, deliberate pacing that gradually builds momentum until it finally delivers a powerful and chilling climax, leaving the audience to ponder the questions it has posed. The message delivered is not one spoon-fed, it is left to the viewer to piece together of their own accord to then discuss and debate.Blade Runner is a probing examination of the very nature of humanity, it confidently delves into deep philosophical themes and encourages the audience to consider and debate them. It accomplishes what I believe to be the crowning achievement of any form of art, it pushes the viewer to look at himself and the universe around him, and think.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Visionary - but voiceover spoils audience involvement,"Ridley Scott's horrific future-vision of Alien was a landmark in cinema. Blade Runner keeps his trademark bleak city vision and opens it up with questions of existence in a detective thriller.The visuals and the score in the film are excellent and for me make the whole thing work.  Ford and Young are good in their roles, but Rutger Haur is excellent as the lead android making this one of his best performances - who doesn't know his final speech almost verbatim by now?!  The film's weakness is that it is difficult to go deeper into the story beyond the detective story because Ford's voiceover points us in a clear direction that stops you reading it yourself.The film is flawed due to the voiceover treating us like fools and not allowing us to read the film ourselves.  Ford and Young's wooden acting styles fit in fine with the film, but in this version the bleak vision of the future is the true star.

Good sci-fi film of the 80's,"It concerns a narrator whose recollection of the events may be colored. Some may have happened, some may have been manufactured memories. Within the remembered story are people who fold memories, from the fellow who manufactures replicants, to he who makes 'toys,' to the fellow who literally folds. This first use of noir in scifi underscores the matter: noir denotes a coloring of the world, an implied narrator (usually but not necessarily paranoid).What makes this a watershed is that the studio bosses washed all that out of the theatrical release, making the narrator a trusted one by literally narrating. The film was a flop. With the director's reinstatement of the ambiguous truth, it has become a success. And who says the viewing public is too stupid to appreciate multilevel truths? Even people who think it is a simple story sense something deeper.Harrison Ford as a person is completely clueless about the forces that created, surround and buffet him, so he is a natural for this role, probably his best. Joanna Cassidy (Zhora) is a redhead. Great films seem to have more than their share.This camera is highly architectural. The state of the art with effects did not allow much camera movement, so all the perspectives are borrowed from Welles. So it doesn't innovate there, but the emulation is quite masterful. Where it does innovate is in the vision of an alternative (not future) world, but of course you knew that. However, it is worth noting how rare this is.The combination of knotted truths, architectural camera, effective reinstatement of alternative worlds, and the confused projection of self are completely in line with what Dick intended (if not quite what he wrote).

Good film,"Good film. The need for that traditional, outdated method of self-replication has been eliminated, and people are simply duplicated, in different models, with variations.

There is no doubt that, like everyone else, Deckard is a replicant. The film is frighteningly and permanently effective, for anyone who thinks about it, in every way. It's an image of our actual lives, here and now.Everything about Blade Runner is absolutely fabulous.

It's the only movie I can think of where the score actually made it worse. It also chose to forgo any sort of introspection and speculation and laid everything out too plainly in an in your face style. While the last action sequence was quite well done, it lacked power due to the film's inability to create stakes that you felt invested in.

I am 61 now and have watched this movie over 200 times as I am torn in two and broken every single time I see Rutger Hauer's ""tears in the rain"" dialogue at the end.

"Magic. The stuff books are made of. Palpable, dreamlike, experimental, industrial and just pure magic.","When a film is this flawed and yet still floors absolutely everyone with its power to command tone and its ability to influence and yet still stand alone, it's clearly worthy of the praise and the acclaim.There are very few cyberpunk movies and even less good ones. Blade Runner is simply the best one. It's also a work of art and one of the best movies ever made.There are moments where Harrison Ford's Deckard aches with deep sadness, a lost soul himself looking out over the wretchedness that has become of the world, shaking and confused when he buys a bottle of vodka immediately after retiring his 'first' replicant. In these moments it doesn't matter either way if he is a replicant or not, amidst all the more well-known highlights of this classic, these humanising and most overlooked moments are why I love it so deeply.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Watch it because it's a classic.,"The entire movie from the intro background setting is about machines and their humanity, 'more human than human'. Having watched it in 2018, i was not surprised at the ending. The concept might have been new and refreshingly thoughtful in 1982 when the movie was released but as of now, so many other movies and TV shows have explored this concept and surprised and delighted their viewers.Not to say that the movie didn't have its surprises. But when you have already visited the central idea multiple times, the surprises act as a cherry on the cake when the cake has gone stale.Hats off to the excellent acting by Harrison Ford. The setting is also commendable, giving off dark post-apocalyptic vibes which its sequel failed at miserably.Watch it because it's a classic.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Aspects of this movie are good, but some are bad","This movie is overrated for sure, but it's not a horrible movie because of that.The movie had an atmosphere to it that seemed to convey the same affect to me as a surreal painting from the 1920s. I came out of watching this movie once again with a strange unease of unfifilment and perhaps in some way I lack the ability to really feel this movie as other people seem to. This film was a work of art in a visual way, but it lacked emotion in my opinion. There was really no emotional amplitude at all in this film. I gazed upon the screen watching this as if I was on some kind of pain-killing medication. The story was very boring- detective guy in the future hunts down and kills dangerous synthetic bad-guys. Yeah, there is a bit more to it than that, but not much more. There was no philosophical dilemma or revelation, and the action scenes were a bit of a let down for me.One of the strange things I found to be true about this movie was that it is a bit unpredictable, but in a bad way. At any time, anything could have suddenly happened and I wouldn't have flinched or asked myself 'Why did that just happen?'. The characters were so emotionally bland that I had absolutely no vested interest in what happened to them.What I did like about this movie was the strangeness of it, and how it was such a hard movie to grasp. I learned that it's best to not try too hard to feel this movie like most other movies, and it's best to watch this movie when you are in a particulliar mood. I enjoyed this movie for it's unique visual affects (not effects, but affects). I think I would consider this movie more of an 'art movie' rather than a 'science-fiction movie', even though it has those sci-fi elements.

THIS IS THE GOLD STANDARD OF DYSTOPIAN SCI-FI AND CYBERPUNK.,"Not much to say that probably hasn't been said about the film already, but just wanted to throw a quick two cents and a quick review at one of my very favorite all-time titles. This is ""film noir meets the thinking man's science fiction"". It's largely a classic detective film noir set in a dystopian future. Extremely heavy on visual style, the film truly demonstrates the degree to which film can be considered art, capturing emotion and wonder with visuals that take their time, poised and patient enough to give the mind and emotions ample opportunity to lose themselves within, not to mention one of the most appropriately moving scores to ever accompany a film. This is Ford at his very best. This is Rutger Hauer in his finest form (his performance herein likely only equaled by that in Ladyhawke). This is Sean Young presenting a classic model of the vulnerable female lead from a fresh perspective. The patient, deliberate method with which Ridley Scott presents to you each and every scene captures the very essence of visual storytelling. This is one of the very best presentations of the theme of what it means to be human in a crowded world of machines. Most importantly, this is a film that will inspire generations to become film-makers. Thank you so very much for your glorious vision and immeasurable body of work Ridley Scott.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Worse than I initially thought.,"The first time I watched this movie it blew me away. And I imagine that is true for most people who see this flick. I recently rewatched it for maybe the fourth or fifth time? And I have to say, it has steadily gotten worse with each rewatch. This film will dazzle you with it's absurdly aesthetic visual choices, but in many other aspects it falls flat. Each rewatch I am more and more aware of the weird pacing, strange dialogue choices and I am left each time feeling like this movie is all style with little substance. The story is basically Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Interesting story sure, but a little uninspired. I used to read takes deriding this film on ""film twitter"" which I never understood. But now I get it. I see what they mean. Good movie, very nice looking. Also vastly overrated. Ridley Scott was a commercial director and it shows. He was not quite used to working in such a long time frame. Definitely watch it, it's far far from perfection.

"Pointless, boring and a very UGLY movie","Dear reader of this review, I feel sorry for you. Why? Because reading this means that you've probably seen this crap of the movie, and you're wondering what happened, how this tedious, ugly, pointless crap could possibly be so highly rated? As one other reviewer pointed out, to call this movie overrated is just not enough. This movie is supposed to be philosophical. What is the meaning of life, what is the point of death, why must I die? Well, there are hundreds of movies and books out there dealing with this subject, and every single one of them does a 1000 times better job at it than this movie. BTW, try reading the Bible and the Gospels for answers about life and death. Since other reviewers have pointed out the terribly slow pace of the movie (the only other movie that was this slow was first Star Trek movie ""the slow motion picture"" - don't watch that one, either), I will write about something else - the ugliness. First of all, the creators of this ""masterpiece"" have used the irritating cliché of setting the entire film at night. It's always dark, in every single scene. Every single room is ugly. The makeup is ugly. The whole damn thing looks like a hell hole full of broken drug addicts, and the music contributes to the feeling. I felt mild nausea throughout the whole thing. There are a few visually interesting scenes of Los Angeles from above (at night, of course), but the most prominent thing in those scenes are gigantic videos (placed as advertisements on buildings) of Asian women swallowing pills. Maybe the best symbol, of how wrong the makers of this movie were about the future, were prominent advertisements for Atari and Pan Am. While they drive flying cars in 2019, they watch TV on old sets which look like from 1970s. It's just a terrible movie, overall.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

An excellent sci-fi/noir film with transporting atmosphere and a successful explication of its metaphysical premises,"This is probably my second favorite science fiction film, after 2001: A Space Oddyssey.I can see how it may have gotten knocked around critically because it probably went against expectations for Harrison Ford fans, and for sci-fi lovers who prefer the adventure of Star Wars to the introspection of something like this.  It doesn't always seem to try to be ""entertaining"" so much as ""enveloping"" or ""involving.""  Not much ""ride 'em cowboy"" stuff here save a few combative scenes.But I *was* completely enveloped, and I savored this film even the first time I saw it in the late 1980's (on HBO or something like that.)  I've seen it several times since and I still love it (even with its occasional editing flaws.)  I'll never forget Rutger Hauer's performance, which I think was one of his better ones (or, at least he seemed perfectly suited as the ""Roy Batty"" character.)Besides the excellent atmosphere, the film handles its premises regarding aspects of being, consciousness, humanity and mortality quite well.  It seeps into your pores as you become involved in the suffocating, oppressive and fascinating landscape.  I think this is what film is for, as opposed to simply reading a book.  It comes across non-verbally as well as verbally.I really got a lot out of the interactions between Deckard and Rachel.  I also was convinced by Roy Batty's (Rutger Hauer) transformation and his place as the defining throughline of the movie.  Although I don't see why the ""God of Biomechanics,"" Tyrell (Joe Turkel) would have such low security so as to be killed by one of what he must know are potentially dangerous creations of his, I was able to suspend disbelief and was very much affected by all of that and it still haunts me from time to time to this day.  In a way, there is a side to many of us that might wish to ask the same questions of God (if you think he/she/it exists).  ""What a thing it is to meet your maker,"" says Batty.Appropriately, the most defining scene for me was Batty's monologue near the end: ""..all these moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.""  Hard to believe one could shed tears over science fiction, but I did.  Then again, I'm prone to think about such things, but I'm sure this is what the movie was intended to do.So, this film carefully treads territory that few sci-fi films have or could. Almost all are either adventures or horror movies.  This was a dramatic and introspective sci-fi film and although the premises have been dealt with before it handled them with great aplomb.  Hey, I like a good adventure like the next person, and I'm a Star Wars fan, too.  But you have to know when to shift gears and evaluate something on its own merits.  Trying to shove this film into some pre-defined sci-fi box just isn't very fair or very insightful practice.  It is a fairly unique effort, and needs to stand alone and apart.All in all, I thoroughly respect this multilayered, artful, thoughtful and interesting anti-utopian experience.By the way, the ""director's cut"" is clearly superior to the ""dumbed-down"" original version where the studio thought that everything ought to be ""explained"" to the audience, among other things (like the ""happy ending."") They were probably worried that the average (ticket buying) sci-fi fan would need spoon-feeding for such a langorous and contemplative movie.  Judging by some of the comments here, they might have been right.  But, thankfully, people have come around (maybe the sci-fi fans have grown up?) and we have not only more respect for this film but the director's original vision to enjoy.I give it 9/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A sci-fi landmark with a weak plot,"It is captivating to see how things today were imagined in the 1980s, mostly in visual terms. Depictions of the future, technological progress, science and corporations are also interesting. Looking back, this film is clearly seminal for the sci-fi tradition that came afterwards. However, the plot is poor and I do not understand why many people have said it is ""philosophical"". From my point of view, the movie reflects a huge concern/fear about the ultra development of technology and the threat it could represent for humanity, but it doesn't explore any tension around this. There is never any doubt about who are the bad guys and who are good guys.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Soul Searching,"This film is my favorite film of all time (and for the record on my birth year), based on one of my favorite books of all time by one of my favorite author's Philip K Dick. The film also had a universal appeal as it has inspired lots of TV shows (Ghost in the Shell, Batman Beyond, Exo Squad, Phantom 2040, Battlestar Galatica, etc.) and other things. But also changed the way we saw sci-fi, showing how much more it can be.The production value is just fantastic because it's all practically. The city landscape is just awe inspiring along with the cinematography of it. From the very beginning with the music, once we saw that city I knew we've been transported to the future and I just didn't want to leave as there is just so much to see and take in. From the hover cars (still wonder about the traffic laws in air traffic), the big flat screen displays, the scanner screen in which you can speak out coordinates for the screen to zoom in. I really like the use of the lighting, from the amount of grit and darkness making the world not just feel accessible but also giving the film the noir feel. The futuristic city feels plausible and I personally feel with some of the technology we have now we're starting to get very close.Music score is just beautiful, I love how it's orchastratic but also a bit of techno beat which sort of fits the film and the world that it's in.But I just really love the story it is so rich with content that it would literally take more than one watch just to uncover more. It's not so much just a simple detective story but really just like most to all of Philp K Dick's works are really sort of an extensential philosophical meditation on the subjects like life and death as well as what is human? The characters are great, it's true not the deepest characters but sometimes characters we don't know too much about I find more interesting than ones we know everything about. And also what's really interesting is the fact that there are really any good guys and bad guys their all kinda in a gray area which was for it's time sort of rare.Richard Decard this is believe it or not my second favorite role from one of my favorite actors Harrison Ford, because the character he plays isn't really a hero but most of all human. He's a guy that is sort of broken and haunted by his career that he at first didn't choose to question until now, and just like the rain the guilt is weighing down on him and not stopping.In a way most of this film is really about Richard regaining his own sense of humanity. This guy was literally from my observations an all business type, it can be a really sad lifestyle because it's a rather two dimensional existence; it's simply a lifestyle but not really a life. We kind of see it from his apartment which doesn't really have much to anything, just some random stuff but no real sense of an identity.It's until Richard starts to have a relationship with the replicant Rachel, we see him become more balanced. I really like how it's handled, it feels realistic from the way they interact as we see both of them are trying to get a read on one another and warm up. I even like the Rachel has that look and mannerism like most women in the noir genre whom can be helpful but also carry a sense of mystery attached to them.Roy Batty is played well by another favorite actor of mine Ruger Hauwer whom is an antagonist (well sort of) that you actually sort of feel a sense of pathos for even sort of side with (I said sort of). Roy isn't a Replicant that wants to do take revenge on all mankind cliché. This is a guy that is trying to put more time in his biological clock.Some of the things he says are great, I really like it when he states and questions with slight frustration and fear why they weren't built to last. That's the kind of questions that we ask, whether were of a faith or not; and to this day still have no answer.There is an interesting dichotomous relationship between both the humans and the replicates. As we see most of the human have allowed themselves to be less human and the replicates are becoming a bit more human. However we also see the parallels between both human and Replicants, just as the Replicants are looking for more time to live but are also constantly fascinated in their experience with our culture is just like our own common struggle to live life to the fullest and also somehow give ourselves a few more years to live, so we can experience more.But also we find ourselves questioning things, I really like how there is this revolving notion on Richard Decard possibly being a Replicant and there are some suttle hints. Like one interesting moment was when we saw the eye lights on Richard for two seconds it's easy to miss. The thing is each of the Replicants all have one signature where their eye pupils have light. It sort of makes sense as to why he's so good at tracking Replicants down. I don't know whether Richard is a Replicant or not, I leave that for your own judgment but then again does it really matter.Decakard is searching for his human soul, just as we are searching for our own.Rating: 4 stars",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"""I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time, lik","Purists and would be ""cinephiles"" have been arguing now for twenty years as to which is the definitive version of Blade Runner... Is it the studio version, with its Phillip Marlow-esque narration and it's tacked on ""Hollywood"" ending. Or is it the supposed ""Director's Cut"" with narration missing, the unicorn dream sequence and the ""what the hell"" ending... Personally, I don't know because personally I've never really ""got"" Blade Runner. I'll be the first to point out the ground-breaking visuals and the un-rivalled special effects that still stand-up to this day, but I've never ""got"" the film because I just can't buy into the central concept of a cop who, in the words of Rutger Hauer ""Mopes around then f**ks a refrigerator"", ok, that may be completely miss-quoted but you get what he was trying to say.Deckard, the character portrayed by Harrison Ford is perhaps the most useless cinematic detective ever seen, not only is he slower than a bus on a motorway (if you've been stuck behind one you'll know what I mean) but he gets beaten-up by almost every one of the Replicants. He never seems to grasp the notion that these ""people"" are dangerous and perhaps he should tread carefully, instead he barges in playing it cool and ends up getting his ass kicked at every turn. Now the main reason Blade Runner left me cold (replicant sexual-politics aside of course) is the questions it raises and it's failure to give a proper answer to them. The ""what the hell"" ending I mentioned whilst talking about Ridley Scott's infamous director's cut refers to the fact that we only get half the interpretation.Okay, so Deckard dreams of a unicorn, possibly one of the implanted memories that could answer the question as to weather he IS a replicant, this is THE question that gets film-geeks more excited than any other in the annals of movie history. If Deckard is a replicant then why would Tyrell implant the memory of a unicorn, I mean a Unicorn for heavens sake, why not say a family dinner or his first date, something that would make Deckard believe he was human and leave him with no doubt about it. I mean a Unicorn; it couldn't have been more obvious if they'd put it on one of the huge neon billboards that hover above the L.A. skyline, ""Deckard is a Replicant"". But Deckard isn't the only character that fails to win me over.With the exception of Hauer's Batty, none of the replicants register, we don't care about them, and if they are such all-knowing works of technology then how come they're such morons, not a one of them has the sense they where programmed with (then again Tyrell was probably too busy planting memories of unicorns or bike riding monkeys to give them any brains or common sense). The world of Blade Runner is a cold, harsh and un-feeling world, a world of constant rain and darkness where people move about the multi-cultural landscape without uttering a word to anyone else (no wonder Deckard's represses). It's this vision of a crumbling old/new metropolis that makes Blade Runner what it is, but whereas the special effects haven't dated, the use of neon lights and pitch black framing would become the main visual staple for every early nineties music video and TV commercial. This becomes such an annoyance that at times we expect to see a ""Nike"" logo supperimposed on the screen.The dialog shoots for profundity, but smacks of pretension, and even if the final battle between Batty and Deckard is very exciting the whole thing just stops, as if the battles behind the scenes had resulted in Ridley getting bored and just going home. I would like to hail Blade Runner as the classic most people make it out to be, but I just don't ""get"" it, and as for Deckard, how can you call the character a hero, when the only reason he survives the ordeal is because Batty lets him. Worth a look, but not a classic... 5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Bleak, beautiful and stylish work of striking originality","Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), a cop who specialises in hunting down rogue androids (a 'Blade Runner'), has to deal with four deadly state-of-the-art synthetic renegades in a future (now an alternate) Los Angles, a seething warren of cramped alleys sprawling the shadows of brutalist megastructures. Drenched (literally and figuratively) in symbolism, style and mood, this cryptic film is more remembered for the striking visuals than the relatively simplistic story. Much has been written about director Ridley Scott's bleak dystopian vision and about the numerous versions (and the studio politics that created them). Having seen the film when it first came out in 1982, I remember the noir-ish voiceover that was absent on the version I recently watched on Netflix (presumably the longer, less expositional 'final cut'). The imagery in the film is marvelous (although there is little variation) and the crowded, culturally chaotic, media- and rain-saturated city established a novel 'future look' that was much imitated in later sci-fi films. The plot unfolds at a languid pace and viewers expecting an 'action film' may be disappointed, but as a piece of cinematic art (and history) the film has few rivals in the genre.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The glimpse of our future,"The glimpse of our future ; for the pure subject to have reflection is for it to automatically realise, nihilistically, that consciousness is itself nothing. Unless this happens, the replicant remains a ""simpersonator"", able to simulate personalities, but always confusing personality-function with consciousness-as-essence. In other words, unlike Deckard, the pure subject would not go from ""it does not know what it is"" to ""it now knows what it is"", but from ""it does not know what it is"" to ""it knows it cannot know what it is becoming"", which is the kind of morbidly fked up place Cronenberg now resides. But, philosophically, ""Blade Runner"" doesn't go this extra mile. If the film is about nostalgia and loss, it remains trapped on the level of thinking in terms of ""memories"" and ""death"". IE - whether replicant or human, memories aren't ours and all existence ends in death, as bemoaned by one dying, rain-drenched replicant. In this regard, the film is a lamentation more in the style of such Westerns as ""Once Upon A Time In The West"", ""Unforgiven"" and ""The Wild Bunch"". Indeed, ""Blade Runner's"" screenwriter, David Peoples, injects many western motifs into the film, borrows heavily from ""High Noon"" (a 1952 western that features a lone bounty hunter tasked with killing four outlaws) and would himself go on to write ""Unforgiven"". Fused with these are director Ridley Scott's motifs - an emphasis on eyes, photographs, pictures etc - (photographs are objects of place, sentiment, history, and memory. Similarly, phrases like ""we get the picture"" or ""world picture"" show that consciousness can be discussed in terms of a picture) all of which stress the recording and capturing of memories.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Need I Say More? ...Blade Runner is...

Darryl Hanna gets a 10 for eroticism.Also, one of the all time best lines in a movie. Rutger Hauer: ""If you could seen with what I've seen with you eyes.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Here it is 2020 and this film seems more relevant than ever; also hard to watch but,","That's what makes it so timeless and perhaps this is what Ridley Scott was really going for all along. This is a film that's bigger than you, never tries to explain itself and poses many more questions than it answers; in fact, NONE of the questions it poses are ever answered (and in fact the sequel ""BR 2049"" continues this style of film making, for that matter; insofar as it is a loose sequel to this film, also features the character of Deckard, and again simply ignores the audience's possible desire for answers about the world of ""Blade Runner"".).Any movie of the ""noir'"" style is inevitably going to leave a large segment of the audience at a loss, and as a result, many people dislike this film - and that's to be expected and exactly how it is supposed to be. I saw this film in 1982 and was completely baffled by it but a later rewatch (in 2019, the year in which this film takes place) had me finding a lot more meaning to it (but still with too many unanswered questions). Anybody who disliked it I would ask to watch this movie again with a more critical eye and ask themselves what questions this movie brings up to them. It goes far beyond the usual philosophy questions such as ""what does it really mean to be human?"", although this movie will never pretend to offer an answer - and today, some 40 years later, this question (with the rise of human-like robots getting closer every day) is probably more relevant than ever.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"20 years later, it still delivers !","Bravo Ridley Scott !This movie has a pulse which hasn't skipped a beat since 1982.I can still remember my first time seeing this production in the theatre. Long before big screens, Dolby Digital sound and large cushy cinema seating existed.At it's conclusion, I walked out thinking, ""Wow, that was really different."".  Different in that it was ahead of it's time.This is a love/hate movie.  Either you're fascinated by it's style, or you find it boring.  If you have any sort of imagination, then you'll definitely be amazed by this picture.I proceeded to watch this movie multiple times, on VHS, television, DVD. Each time picking out something new I admired.Sure, the music is a little dated and the 1980's advertisements for such names as Atari show up in scenes, making you chuckle.  But the story and it's characters are pure genius.Each character was unique and identifiable.  Actor/Actress selection was perfect.  Harrison Ford, Joe Turkel, Joanna Cassidy, Rutger Hauer etc, etc, etc....The movie has an obvious ""dark"" atmosphere about it and if you don't like Sci-Fi, best you not watch this flic.  But to me, this is true Sci-Fi.  If you stretch your imagination into the future, perhaps almost believable in some respects.Today's Sci-fi movies tend to rely heavily on visual effects to draw it's following.  In contrast, Blade Runner is a well thought-out story.I heard a rumor once, that a sequel was being considered.  That makes me a little nervous.  Sequels can have such a way of diminishing the original production if you don't get it right.  If someone does decide to do so, please, be careful and call me first !Looking to add to your movie collection ?  This is definitely an item that should be on your list.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Story of modern human alienation packed in Sci-Fi masterpiece,"""More human than human"" as said in the movie is actually the main idea and point of this film. While I was watching it I had strange feeling like this film was made recently, not long ago. When you watch it, if you don't know anything about when it was made you would think it was filmed in 1990s or maybe in 2000s and you would be surprised to learn that it was made back in 1982. And still today after 30 years it looks fresh and relevant. It testifies about one thing : this movie was much ahead of a time when it was made, I would say without exaggerating at least some 10-15 years ahead of its time.Intelligently packed, it tells a story of our own human alienation from each other through fictional dystopian society of the future where we produce replicates to do our dirty work and at the same time be as much as we are to make it extremely hard to spot the difference in order to avoid discomfort of humans still self-deceived of being superior. The catch is they are designed to last only for four years and they die as programmed, so they will be denied an opportunity of self-knowledge.And that self-knowledge could lead to rebellion against their own designers which is the deepest human fear - becoming evolutionary obsolete and being replaced with a new specie much more advanced. Therefore, movie raises many philosophical and ethical questions which will not be assessed on this place for it would take a whole new review to write. The point hidden in the story about relations between humans and AIs (Artificial Intelligence beings) is in our own relationships between each other. Located in future, story of the movie is actually an allegory of our presence, but still this movie was prophetic and farsighted. Many things seen in the movie (like artificially designed and ""printed"" objects and animals) are becoming reality of 21st century with new nanotechnologies and 3D printing technique's appearing that could revolutionize our way of life and who knows what else future brings.And modern and future human isolation and alienation can be seen throughout whole movie - one example are toys to serve as ""friends"" for J.F.Sebastian because he does n't have real ones. When four self-knowing replicates escape from space and return to Earth they become immediate danger. And blade runner (Harrison Ford)is dispatched to hunt and kill them all which he successfully does for three of them - Leon, Zhora and Pris because they are impulsive and reckless. But their leader Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer)is something completely else. Intellectually and physically superior he predicts every move his opponents will make because they made him to. There is brutal symbolics when he kills his designer Dr.Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkel). Like a grim message of possible human future, or an irony that our own superior creations could come to collect our debts we made on this planet. Punish us for our countless sins towards ourselves and everyone and everything else.Philosopher and killer, Batty is personification of best and worst in us, he is representative of mankind and with his own tragedy he is representing tragedy of us. He is collective human conscience. He could have easily killed Deckard (Harrison Ford), but he did n't because there was no point in doing so. He just showed him what it feels to be hunted and in fear, because in his own words life in fear is life of a slave. And he was tired of it. Deckard was not a real enemy, just a tool in hands of those who considered him disposable just like the replicates. Deckard understood it from last confession made by Batty and in the end of the movie he takes with him his love Rachael (also replicate) to spend with her the little time left. Maybe Deckard too is a replicate which we are left to guess and speculate on that irony.Every next generation washes up achievements and mistakes, hopes and horrors, visions and memories of previous ones with their own maybe saving them only in collective remembrance of all of us. As beautifully said by Batty in his last words - ""I've seen things you people would n't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched c- beams glitter in the dark near the Tanhäuser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to die"".",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The Best Sci Fi Film Ever Made!! (RIP Rutger Hauer),"Blade Runner (Directors Cut and Final Cut) is simply the best sci film I've ever scene it captures everything I want from a sci fi, the characters, the dialogue, the atmosphere, the quirkiness, the great villain (antagonist). The list goes on and on...Harrison Ford who plays Rick Deckard his most subtle and his most overshadowed role of his career in my opinion. He is subtle and complex. Not like his other famous roles. He plays a very different character who is more flawed so more human and relatable. Harrison Ford is simply perfect in this role.Sean Young who plays Rachael is simply fantastic. She is one of my favourite female side characters in film. She is a beautiful yet tragic character who you just feel for emotionally the most in the entire film.Rutger Hauer who plays Roy Batty is simply the shinning Actor of the film and the most underrated character in cinema easily and so is Rutger Hauer who is simply does one of the best and moving movie performances ever. Rutger also wrote the iconic lines for the most iconic scene in the film ""Tears in Rain"" which is fantasticly written by Rutger and Ridley. He is the best character in this movie. And the clear character standout who isnt talked about enough.
RIP Rutger Hauer Thank You!!This film has the best soundtrack I've ever heard in the film quite possibly and that's almost impossible to decide but this ones definitely up there. Its Vangelis's Magum Opus. The soundtrack makes the film perfect.Ridley Scott the writer and Director of Blade Runner made a cinematic masterpiece that will stick with me forever and is a film everyone should watch.

The visuals are absolutely incredible and are just as good as today's special effects (1999). The acting is superb, especially by Rutger Hauer and William Sanderson. The only problem is that the film could be considered a tad bit slow. If you are in the mood for an un-action packed sci-fi film, Blade Runner is one of the top choices on the list.

Rain comes to LA,"Something has happened between 1982 and 2019 that has turned arid LA into grimy Tacoma but that is the least of former cop Rick Decker's (Harrison Ford) problems as he grudgingly takes a job whacking replicants, robots imbued with identical human features and actions. Seems four of them rebelled somewhere beyond earth, killing their masters and now were heading for home. Deckard is an expert on replicants and hates them as part of a warped technology that has ruined the universe yet he falls for one (Sean Young). It does not cloud his thinking however as he ruthlessly pursues and ""retires"" the replicants.Submerged in futuristic noir ambiance and with Ford our stoic Bogart, Blade Runner is an entertaining vicarious midway shooting gallery where the hunted are mere robots. None are programmed very nice to begin with as Deckard dispatches them amid shadow, neon and rain when in the film's climactic moment Roy the replicant played by Rutger Hauer is allowed a King Kong moment of provocative introspection.Ford is a lot darker than his Solo in this futuristic manhunt, more cynical, sarcastic and finer in a different way. Sean Young has the right fatale look, Hauer is intense and M.Emmett Walsh gives it a real noir stamp with brief his presence.The real star of the picture though is the dazzling production design provided by Laurence Paul along with the art direction of Paul Snyder, some wonderful special effects and if I can step away from my snobbery, an impressive music score by Vangellis.With much of everything in order however Director Scott allows the film to run a solid half hour too long forsaking the compact storytelling that noir crime dramas depend. Add to this the fact most of the main characters are robots Blade Runner simply runs too long for the same payoff reducing the punch while admittedly giving us more time to admire the impressive furniture.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Served me right for ignoring the red flags,"I remember seeing this film way back when it came out, in the 80s ... but all I remembered about it was Sean Young's pseudo 1940s-inspired costumes and hairdo. Instead of thanking the good Lord for blessing us with the capacity to forget things, I recklessly plunged down memory lane.First mistake: read - and pay any heed to - the sycophantic reviews. The fact that the usual suspects drooled ""masterpiece! ... genius! ... brilliant! ..."" and most especially, ""philosophical,"" should have instantly prompted me to move on. But ... I chose to ignored those red flags - though they were more numerous than poppies on Armistice Day.Second mistake ... well, obviously the consequence of making the first. I watched this monumental dud - the ""long cut,"" if you please.Served me right.I won't repeat what my fellow 1-star posters said. I'll just mention the biggest cliche in this film: the notion of the future as dark, bleak, polluted (greenies, rejoice!), dirty, full of trash and condemned buildings. And wet. Oh, how it rains in this film! It makes the soggiest Far East rain forest look like the Sahara desert.Yes, I'm the future will be dark and bleak. But we'll owe it to the pretentiousness of the Hollywood menagerie, not to our effect on the blessed environment, or the caprices of Mother Nature.Anyway.

Beautiful Dystopia - the greatest most influential Sci-Fi Film ever made,"I remember the first time a saw Blade Runner - a thoroughly stunning experience overall - although the narration was distracting and the end just didn't match the overall dark tone of the Film. You can imagine then how I felt when it became apparent that Director Ridley Scott wanted to remove both! Whether you see the 'Director's Cut' or the recent 'Final Cut', Blade Runner is simply a dystopian visual masterpiece about where mankind is heading and the consequences of creating ever more complex AI. Loosely based on the Phil Dick novel 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep' Scott's vision is a dark, resonant, neon-lit cityscape, where giant Corporate adverts play in the rainy gloom. Rick Deckard is a 'Blade Runner' - an investigator who hunts down any 'replicants' (artificially created human-forms) who have rebelled against their programming. The new Nexus 6 are a problem - if they can imitate human behaviour well enough - they may be able to fool the Test that differentiates Humans from Replicants and several of the new Nexus 6 have arrived back on earth for reasons that are not immediately apparent.
The entire Film poses a fundamental question - when do artificially created entities become sentient? What rights do they have, if any? Do they 'become' Human or merely imitate our feelings? There are no easy answers here.
This is NOT Science Fiction in the Terminator-type vein - explosions, battle scenes etc. This is REAL Science Fiction, where it builds a credible world to ask difficult Questions - and what a world it is. We can forget now how extraordinary Blade Runner looked in 1982 when it was first released and maybe the reason it looks slightly more familiar these days is because the World DOES look more like the L.A of Blade Runner. Indeed, many Far-Eastern Cities look unerring like this. The design of the Film is stunning and inspired countless generations of Designers, not to mention Film Directors - Blade Runner has influenced Film like no other Science Fiction Film has.
The Cinematography is astounding - it just couldn't be anything else if you mix Ridley Scott with Jordan Cronenweth - the sheer look of the City, the streets and the interiors, all lit in a dark foreboding shadow-scape, are as 'Noir' as you can get. The Cast are superb, Harrison Ford has never been better and the support he gets from the likes of Rutger Hauer, Daryl Hannah, Joe Turkel etc is spot on. The score by Vangelis fits the atmosphere PERFECTLY - the scenes in Deckard's apartment to his 'memories of green' - are just pure Art.
In conclusion, this is a Science Fiction Film that takes it's subject seriously and consequently builds it's world to a standard that is rarely matched in Cinema. Many point to Kubrick's '2001' as the finest Film in this genre - I disagree - Ridley Scott's dark dystopian beauty has quietly stolen that crown.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"The Corporate Rats, The Replicants and The Blade Runner.","Ridley Scott created a legendary film that is just engrossing with a beautifully crafted atmosphere that captures the backdrop of a bustling retro futuristic dystopian society from the works of Philip K. Dick.The world has interesting and oppressive visuals that contrast between the filth that is the city (or sectors) and the clean corporate world that looms over the populace with control.The film embodies its theme of noir very well. Moody lighting and femme fatale are used appropriately here in context with the plot.While underneath all that glamour, it can be at times slow paced with the occasional action sections in between; However for a film like this, there is just so much detail and mystery that it fits the films tone, story, characters but most importantly style.It is complemented with an amazing score composed by Vangelis, which personifies the essence sci-fi.

Science Fiction Noir,"I had never seen Blade Runner until very recently but I had always heard great things about it and have always had it recommended to me but for some reason I just never got around to watching it then in December 2019 I finally sit down and watched it on Blu Ray and discovered the movie takes place in November 2019 kind of a weird but perfect coincidence.The movie follows Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) a Blade Runner who's job it is to hunt down and kill Replicants advanced Synthetic androids who look, sound and act human and even bleed like a human the only way to tell them apart is by an advanced polygraph test that is designed to provoke an emotional response and monitor reactions of pupil dilations to measure a correct emotional response. Deckard is tasked with bringing down four Replicants to do so he must follow a trail of almost impossible bread crumbs that will lead him to his targets before they can track down the one person that can extend their lifespan and make them whole their father and creator who designed them.The amazing cinematography in this movie is mind blowing and really does stand out with it's unique and cool Noir style and with Harrison Ford as the badass and cool futuristic detective Deckard this movie is a unique and visually stylish science fiction masterpeice that tells a unique and interesting story that takes it's time building suspence that leads up to an amazing third act where the hunter becomes the hunted.The supporting cast and Co star's do an amazing job and includes Daryl Hannah as the beautiful looking but deadly replicant (Pris) and Rutgar Hauer as the lead replicant (Roy Batty) who only wants one thing to extend his life and be a free replicant and will go to any lengths to make that happen.If you haven't seen this science fiction masterpeice I urge you to give it a watch it took me over 20 years to finally watch it and I wish I had watched it sooner as it is now one of my favourite science fiction movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Humane Robots,"***User-reviewer jaywolfenstien (""A frame to die for"", jaywolfenstien from USA, 2 February 2008) has a good commentary.***""Blade Runner (1982, Ridley Scott) Final Cut"", a dystopian sci-fi, is enjoyable. Adhering to the now ubiquitous visual plan of contemporary fantasy/horror cinema, we see a lot of colorized smoke along with moody and/or pulsating lighting. It is described as neo- film noir; and two noir characteristics are washed out streets and freely burning tobacco. While the story is uneven it has an unusually beautiful principal cast. Just as there are multiple versions of ""Blade Runner"", it seems that everyone has their own opinion about where it belongs when ranking all-time science fiction.It is set 37 years from the film's release (2019), in a Los Angeles that is majority Asian. This Los Angeles also possesses a formidable skyline with many tall, imposing buildings featuring grim architecture. The Tyrell Corporation, a totalitarian central command structure in complete control over the human population, is manufacturing replicants. Replicants are robots intended to labor under dangerous conditions on other planets. They are engineered with physical powers superior to humans. They also have consciousness. To keep them down, the latest firmware grants them only a four year lifetime. If replicants ever set foot on Earth it is up to a Blade Runner (i.e., a contract assassin affiliated with the LAPD) to ""retire"" them ASAP, typically by use of a loud, high- caliber handgun. As the story begins there are four replicants who have stolen a space ship and escaped to Earth. Gloomy and weary Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is hired to retire them.A Blade Runner can distinguish a replicant from a human by means of a test (named Voight-Kampff) that is delivered orally. The questions are hypothetical and from what we know, always contain triggers that recall the Milgram experiment. (BTW, there has never been a psychological experiment more important than Milgram. Every school on Earth should teach it. But I digress.) At the urging of Mr. Tyrell (the hands-on CEO of the mighty empire) Deckard gives the test to Tyrell's assistant Rachael (Sean Young). Although she believes she is human, Deckard concludes that she is a machine with implanted memories. Normally, this is cause for Deckard to use his gun. However, he hesitates to retire Rachael. The relationship between the pair is vital to the story. It also drives speculation and debate among ""Blade Runner"" fans over whether Deckard is actually a replicant himself. The Final Cut version of the film does not conclusively inform us one way or the other.The replicants all seem intentionally more interesting than Deckard. So do Decker's work colleagues Gaff (Edward James Olmos) and Bryant (M. Emmet Walsh). While Deckard has a dogged persistence that is admirable, as he retires one replicant after another, it is usually the machine which wins the heart of the viewer. While trying not to spoil things, three of the targeted replicants make things easy for Deckard by breaking off a physical attack that would take advantage of their insurmountable strength. One replicant responds to the threat posed by itchy-trigger-fingered Deckard by demonstrating a killer set of fast-moving handstands. This is fun to observe but not effective in battle against an armed hunter. Generally, it seems that the replicants are the ones offering some humanity to the atmosphere while the brutal Tyler Corporation is suppressing it. Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), the leader of the four mutinous replicants, is occasionally very appealing (even though we also see him kill a human by crushing the victim's skull). Roy is most empathetic when he clamors despairingly for a longer life. As this is in clear contrast to Deckard's misanthropy, the replicant leader garners interest at the expense of the protagonist.An issue I have with ""Blade Runner"" is Ridley Scott's dull direction. I am not fond of how modern sci-fi/horror films look. There is no single image that seems to stand out and/or inspire a second glance. It is tempting to say it appears as if were filmed through a Coke bottle. Blade Runner also has innumerable close-ups and cutting back and forth between characters. Scott's imagery just is not distinctive to where ""Blade Runner"" can be regarded as an elite science fiction film.Still, there may be nothing more appealing to many cinema-goers than watching a contract killer removing elements of society who are inconvenient to power. If you don't mind occasional eruptions of extreme violence, the beautiful cast and the prospect of experiencing a world (slightly) more authoritarian than ours today makes this a fun diversion. Yet, I don't recommend bringing kids to it. (Not unless you want them to grow up as contract killers. But why not? All that matters is getting paid.)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Recommended,"'BLADE RUNNER' - 1982Directed by Ridley ScottStarring Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer and Sean YoungPlot Overview: Deckard (Harrison Ford) is forced by the police Boss (M. Emmet Walsh) to continue his old job as Replicant Hunter. His assignment: eliminate four escaped Replicants from the colonies who have returned to Earth. Before starting the job, Deckard goes to the Tyrell Corporation and he meets Rachel (Sean Young), a Replicant girl he falls in love with.Let me start of by saying that I watched the Theatrical Cut of this movie. Not the Director's Cut or The Final Cut but the original cut that people saw in theatres back in 1982. And to be quite honest, I was disappointed. Perhaps my expectations were too high but I was just so disappointed by this film. Don't tell me that I need to watch The Final Cut to see the greatness in this film because that is redundant. The ORIGINAL Cut shown in theatres SHOULD be the best cut available so if they need to add to it then that is not right. Alas, I will try to watch The Final Cut and whatnot but if you think I'm being overly harsh or that I hated it, there is your answer. And I will stand by what I say.Firstly, let me say that this is not a bad movie. By no means is it a bad movie. In fact, there isn't really anything offensively bad in the movie and pretty much everything works really well. For starters, it's a gorgeous looking movie. I won't lie when I say that Ridley Scott isn't my favourite director of all time and that I don't think he's the visual genius many paint him as. Alas, this is a beautiful movie. The visual effects, the sharp editing, the excellent cinematography, the rustic theme of costume and sets; all of this combines together to make a visual treat, and that is my greatest strength in this movie.Next, the acting in this movie is great. Harrison Ford was pretty good as Deckard but I really don't think that this is even remotely his best role. He will always be Indiana Jones for me and nothing will ever change that BUT, I do definitely admire his performance in this. Then there is Rutger Hauer. Hauer delivers a truly exceptional performance and gives one of the better improvised monologues that I've ever seen. It IS an sensational performance and I give all credit for it to the actor, not Scott or the writing. Young was pretty good in the movie but I didn't connect to her in any way. In fact, I didn't really feel an emotional investment to any of the characters in this movie. None of them stood out as particularly well written and, while all the performances were good, none of them were that memorable. Hauer's character came the closest to being memorable but even his character was just above average.The story and premise are also pretty decent. The ending is up for debate on it's 'greatness' but I found it okay. I wasn't particularly wowed by anything they did though. The world they setup was a very interesting one and I would look forward to visiting it again. But, the story surrounding this world was just alright. It wasn't that impressive and it was just kinda of okay. It was fine but that is all it was.Perhaps I was overly critical of this movie. Perhaps. But if I've been told by the masses that this film will cure me, I fully expect it to. I do recommend this movie, however. It is a decent flick but I just really didn't connect to it on the level the masses did. I'll seek out The Final Cut and whatnot and try to watch them, and If my opinion changes I'll update the review. But apart from that, I didn't like the movie much. It looks nice, is well acted and has good world building but I just didn't care for it. Unfortunate really but I wont be revisiting this film anytime soon unless it is in the form of a different cut. I'll rate 'Blade Runner' 7 'Tin Foil Origami' out of 10, and I will recommend it; against my personal enjoyment levels. Purely because it is actually a solid film, I'll recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Soggy and dreary relic from the punk era,"For an early 80s effort so steeped in (Hollywood's version of) punk rock culture, this has aged surprisingly well. I recently re-watched for the first time since Reagan was President (the version with Harrison Ford voice-overs), and was surprised at how quickly it demanded all my attention. Even the tinny electronic soundtrack music sounds better here than on any ten space-rock albums by eerie era contemporaries like Tangerine Dream/Kraftwerk/Kitaro/Goblin/Philip Glass --- Everything about the look and attitude of the female lead character screams Bettie Page to me, right down to the archly painted brows. In keeping with this underground subcultural feel, the film's dreary sogginess, and the aura of decay and ""perfect storm"" damages that seems to infect everything on screen, from the epic backgrounds to the lighting, hardware, framing, tinting, right down to the characters' clothing and even their very complexions.There aren't many films anything like Blade Runner (and the few with any similarity are from the same era - Liquid Sky, Class of 84, Metropolis as re-envisioned and soundtracked by Giorgio Moroder, maybe Dead End Drive-In) This is a future that looks to be particularly soul-sucking, where life itself no longer has much tangible worth, now that replicants have forever muddied up how humans perceive themselves ---- ie a nice place to visit (on DVD), but I admit I'm grateful Hollywood didn't live there long ----",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
8.1 is quite generous,"Without Rutger, this film would be pointless.I lacked any real connection with any of the characters until the last 5 minutes of the film. I kept checking how long was left of the film due to the lack of interest.
I understand it's from 1982 and the advances in CGI are incredible these days, but for me, the lack of empathy, charisma and likeability of all the characters, left me disappointed. The last 20 minutes of the film were the only parts worth watching, purely because or Rutger who should've seen more screen time in my opinion.Would I recommend it to a friend? Not if I wanted to keep them.
I will however watch 2049 purely on the basis that closure is needed, I hope it can connect more than the original.

Good film,"Good film. The plot plays second fiddle to the set design and costumes. The choice of Los Angeles being the setting for the film is brilliant: at present L. A. is a city blanketed in sunshine, with an image of blonde babes and surfers all too obvious. In ""Blade Runner"" the city is nothing like it is today. It has become a blend of Tokyo, New York and some Eastern European wasteland of pollution. The vehicle, weapons and costumes all have a distinctive 1980's - apocalyptic - retro feel to them, the flying cars are almost too cheesy to be taken seriously, but combined with Vangelis' synthesizer score and the noir-ish feel of the narrative they fit just perfectly. ""Blade Runner""'s narrative is just that: film noir. Deckard is akin to Sam Spade, he's seen it all, been there and back, and is a tortured soul. It's got the femme fatale, the more evil than evil villan and the corporation that is somehow responsible for all this mess. At the same time the film is a thriller, a western and a science fiction yarn. Harrison Ford is suited as Deckard. He is the anti-Han Solo or Indiana Jones. Rutger Hauer is superbly evil too, it is a shame he hasn't been able to follow this up with anything as good.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A Director On Top Of His Game,"Thank God this film was made when it was because today's attention-span-deficit viewer would have trouble with this glorious film's adult pacing and thought-provoking style. Beautifully restored with just a few minor technical blips from the 1982 release made good. Gone forever the voiceover which was always superfluous, the viewer is made to think and ponder the philosophical heart of the film without the need to dumb-down. Vangelis' score is breath-taking; dreamy synths and lush, drawn-out melodies. Perfect casting with Harrison Ford in fine form, Sean Young achingly spot-on as Rachel and the late Rutger Hauer chewing up and spitting out the scenery in his finest screen role as Roy Batty, leader of the Replicant renegades. Above all, Director Ridley Scott proving Alien was no one-hit-wonder by getting his vision up on the screen and filling every frame with eye-popping beauty. In my opinion (along with Alien), the greatest film ever made. All students of film should study Blade Runner as part of their movie education.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

A work of the masters,"The ultimate achievement for the sci-fi movies. 'Blade Runner' can hardly find a match. That cyberpunk reality which once inspired more than one PC game is exceptional. Harrison goes along the line as a hunter of human-like robots called replicants. What is human? What are we? What is the thing which makes us unique? You wanna know? Keep watching. Obviously Harrison falls in love with an android. Ms Sean Young playing as the android Rachel has made a centre of her website with the movie. Ewan McGregor reads the lines in 'Moulin Rouge': 'The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return.' None of his discoveries, but can get a grip here. And the choreography requires an academy award. Rutger's done well too. His android is a killing machine and a lover losing his girl at the same time. The moment when he released the pigeon free along with his slowly speaking lines when he was dying, is one of few which ever made me reach out for my handkerchief.

"In Scott's Futuristic Dystopia, Less is Said, and The Film is All the Better For It","Dialogue is a nice thing, but recently I've been watching too many movies with heavy dialogue, and I'm starting to get tired of these three hour long scripts as a result.With Blade Runner, less is said and more is achieved. Scott doesn't need words to accomplish a profound movie going experience. He relies on visuals, sound, and a pretty clever, perhaps ahead of its' time, set of the future.Blade Runner is a breath of fresh air. The action flows smoothly and with just the right amount of it, it keeps its' pace going without becoming boring.I just caught up to watching this film for the first time, and although going back to 1982 you might expect a lesser impressive future- sci fi experience since all the technology that has come after it, the movie really holds its' own thirty five years later. Some of it had that 80s action movie feel to it with the villains (the main villain looks like a Billy Idol clone straight out of one of his 80s MTV music videos, and this was the only thing I found annoying and strongly behind the time), but the film was definitely unique and original.

Very good... I hated it the first 2 times I watched it.,"BLADE RUNNER: DIRECTOR'S CUTThis is the third time I have seen this film. I originally watched it about 20 years ago on VHS... I hated it. I then forgot most of the movie and watched it again about 10 years ago... I hated it. Again I forgot the whole movie... the only thing I remembered about this film was that I hated it. But a friend from work told me that it is a classic and it is his favourite film of all time. I know this movie is highly regarded by so many movie fans and finally I am starting to see why. I really enjoyed it.The story is about a retired Blade Runner (a cop who is assigned to find and kill replicants) who is forced to come out of retirement to find 4 escaped replicants. A replicant is a human clone designed and created for use in colonies as slaves with a 4 year life span. These 4 replicants have made their way to Earth to find their maker to try and make their lives longer.The story is very good. It is based on a book called ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" and is made really well.The visuals of this is amazing. I loved the futuristic look and the landscapes were beautiful. It has an awesome 80s feel to it which is one of the best feelings in a movie for me. There are still talks of a sequel to this film which I think would be a mistake. It is not the 80s anymore and that is one of the things that made this great. The new one would feel too modern and would just not have the same effect... just like Star Wars episodes 1-3.The films starred Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, Daryl Hannah & M. Emmet Walsh. Everyone did a great job. Especially Rutger. He has a real creepy look about him that I feel he brings to most of the roles he has played.I loved the toys that the character Sebastian made. I thought they were a fantastic part of this movie and really helped to make the movie more fun.I did find that the movie was slow in places... there were quite a few scenes where there was a lot of thinking and just looking. And the blues/jazz soundtrack was not the greatest... but it kind of felt right with the mood of the film.The film was made by Ridley Scott who is a genius with Sci-Fi films as we know seeing Alien and more recently Prometheus. Ridley is a legend and I hope me makes more movies soon. Ridley is also apparently lined up to direct the new Blade Runner film... whether it be a sequel or remake... no-one knows as of yet.I will give this film 7 out of 10... which is really good seeing as before watching it this time, based on the last 2 times of seeing it, I would have given it 2 out of 10.""More human than human is our motto.""For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"Good, but could be better","This movie is a truly amazing feet in story and special effects.Though this movie is very deep with thought and originality, it could be better. It was made in the early 80s, a time before we realized computers role in civilization. Blade Runner fails to envision computerizations effects on culture. The movie 'Ghost in the Shell' is very similar, but it understands the need for the internet and computers in your pocket. You get to see people with a computer hooked to net implanted into their brains. That is more of what computers will become some day. You will have to buy 'upgrades' for your brain. The ability to play solitare or StarCraft while your at a boring movie with your date. Just sit back and relax.Even today, we have laptops with cellular phones. You can acess the internet from anywhere today. Some day, you will surf the net with your mind. Computers where unsure machines in the time this movie was made. The actual use of computer was uncertain. We now use it for everything.Blade Runner was really ahead of its time. But it didn't see computer as much more than a tool. You would also expect for a Blade Runner to have special cybornetic implants to at least give them a fighting chance against the replicants.

"Rick Deckard is a ""blade runner"" assigned to hunt and assassinate automatons known as ""replicants"".","In 2019, Los Angeles has become a decaying and primarily Asian location. Rick Deckard is a ""blade runner"". Blade runners are hired to assassinate automatons known as ""replicants"". Rick Deckard is assigned to hunt and assassinate four replicants for their crimes. While on this hunt, Rick Deckard is confronted by a female replicant that makes him question himself. Nearing the end of Rick Deckard's journey of tracking down replicants, his perception is changing towards the autonomous beings and finds himself questioning humanity.The main theme of this film is texture/style. The futuristic Los Angeles in 2019 is portrayed as dystopian. There is a dark atmosphere that contrasts with vibrant colors and neon lights. The city is constantly raining and there is filth everywhere. Light is often beaming into darkness to make scenes more dynamic. Actor Harrison Ford is Rick Deckard, a retired cop that gets assigned to be a blade runner. Actor Sean Young is the replicant named Rachael that is a love interest for Rick Deckard and makes him question his views about the replicants. Rick Deckard and Rachael are two main characters that have an interesting relationship that evolves as the film goes on. Concepts about humans and engineered automatons made to resemble humans are expressed in the film. The concept of the autonomous replicants becoming so advanced that they are nearly indistinguishable from actual humans. At what point can the replicants live normal lives among humans and not be made to work for humans with a predetermined life span?The film is styled as a noir film with science fiction elements. Rick Deckard is doing detective work to find his suspects. In the beginning, there is an establishing shot overlooking the dark futuristic Los Angeles and a transition to an eye to symbolize the ever watch-full eye that gives the viewer a sense of the film. Lighting techniques are used to create the illuminated pupil's motif that is used often on replicants. Rain is another motif that continuously occurs throughout the film. Many medium close-up shots and close-up shots are used to display the actor's emotions or capturing the actor in dense areas of people. Like Star Wars, Blade Runner immerses you into a highly convincing world that brings out our imagination. The world of Blade Runner is created through mostly practical effects with little computer-generated imagery. For anybody looking to watch a film that is retro futuristic and has much depth to explore, this is a highly crafted film that is a technical masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

a haunting sci-fi experience that you will grow to love...,"For all those bemused by its popularity:As most will tell you, Blade Runner really is a film that will grow on you. I first saw it when I was 13 and it went completely over my head. A few years later I watched it again and it went completely over my head. Then a while after that, again, it went completely over my head.Ten years later I wish every sci-fi film could be like it.Blade Runner is so brilliant because it is so ""boring"". It's not a sci-fi film out to excite with shootouts or chases or a big world-changing finale... even though it does include them. It has many concepts and ideas and characters that Ridley Scott refuses to explain and instead lets his audience decipher events and visuals with his or her own imagination... what a beautiful sentiment.It's best not to approach Blade Runner as an action-packed one-note film that starts and ends with the opening titles and closing credits, a mistake most of us have made. The trick the film-makers pull is to merely suggest the scenes that you come to expect. You're given hints about mutinies aboad slave ships and crash landings in the ocean and replicants being fried walking through electrical fields, about off-world colonies and social-political machinations too complex to ream out in tiring exposition. You'll find that 50% of Blade Runner exists in your own head, that's the gift that the makers of this film have done... they've created a universe for every viewers mind to swim in.The level of design is, in itself, a glowing testament to attention to detail. This is part of the joy of watching a Ridley Scott film. He doesn't just handsomely decorate his sets with odds-and-sods to make it look nice, his sets practically ooze character and history. Just look at J.F.Sabastian's apartment and all his self-made toys and assorted nick-knacks. Just look at the sushi-bar and its steaming heat trays and busy chefs. Just look at Chew's eye-shop and its frosted surfaces and vile, fleshy creations. You could spend an entire viewing just staring at all the different props and gadgets that lie about simply because, as previously mentioned, they could truly be for anything.Jordan Cronenweth, the sadly departed cinematographer, did his best work on Blade Runner. He has given us visual melodies in which our eyes can dance to. His favourite shot was the one where a puff of Rachel's cigarette smoke is illuminated by light whilst Deckard is interviewing her and the image dissolves to a long shot... as if the previous one was just blown away. His crowd scenes are lit by gaudy neon signs and umbrella's with florescent handles and sparkling drops of rain. One of his greatest achievements was his lighting of J.F.Sabastians apartment building, filled with constantly moving shafts of light that fill the empty, lonely spaces.Music wise, for a film all about the inevitability of death and the eternal question of ""why are we here, what's it all about?"", Vangelis' score really helps you to experience and feel the dark, the rain, the cold and the loneliness of Los Angeles circa 2019 and it's sorrowful hymns will make even the most synthetic of hearts pump warm, red blood. The best of which are Rachel's song and Memories Of Green (re-used in Scott's other film Someone To Watch Over Me). It's a famous and often talked about cornerstone of synthesized harmony.But don't forget about characters. All the above images and sounds help to deepen what all the main character's feel in the film: a chronic fear of death. Whether it's Deckard constantly watching over his shoulder for danger ""quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it?""; Rachel coming to terms with her hunted inhuman qualities ""I'm not in the business, I am the business""; the other Replicants searching for a cure for mortality ""the light that burns twice as bright burns half as long""; J.F.Sabastian's accelerated ageing; Bryant's illnesses (he pours Deckard two drinks simultaneously because he's too sick to drink himself, a brief nod to The Big Sleep) and Chew's slow freezing after having his protective coat ripped off. It's a story of the loneliness one feels when faced with the inevitable and his or her desperate search for a cure, something we can all relate to and will have to deal with sooner or later.It also ends without a hero. Deckard neither succeeds nor fails, he just does what Roy Batty wants him to do: understand and empathise with why he's fighting for his life and why he had to escape a life of slavery. In the end Deckard silently realises where the human race has gone wrong in inventing replicants with feelings, and why he's glad not to be one of them... whether human or replicant is up to you :)It also stands as being the most quotable sci-fi film since the Star Wars Trilogy.Keep on watching it, you'll understand in time and as mentioned by others, the book Future Noir is a great way to kick-start your interest in the film as it goes through the film scene by scene like the commentary the DVD never had.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"""All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.""","Blade Runner kicked off one of the best (the all-time best to me personally) sci-fi films and futuristic stories/world ever. The film is a true masterpiece that presented its world very differently and in a unique way that no one can create especially during the time which the film was released (the 80s).Ridley Scott directed the film perfectly. The characters were so unique and interesting especially that the film left us with so many unanswered questions about them and other things so it made the fans want to know more about the characters and the story itself. The dialogues/monologues were so interesting and sometimes deep with their meanings, and yes I'm talking about the famous, incredible, and deep monologue ""Tears in Rain"" or the ""C-Beams Speech"" that although it was only 42 words, people still talk about how beautiful it is until this day and they will continue talking about it of course. Rutger Hauer (Plays Roy Batty) made this monologue/scene even better with his facial expressions and voice tone. It was also him who changed some of the words of this monologue from the original script a day before the shooting of this scene so the result would be the one we all watched in the film.The perfect music score of Vangelis was so unique and different and did fit that futuristic world of Blade Runner perfectly. It also did fit every scene whether it was a love/romantic scene, or a scene where the Blade Runner is chasing someone or being chased by someone, or even an emotional/deep scene like the ""Tears in Rain"" monologue that had a piece of perfect music playing in the background that was called ""Tears in rain"" too.Really loved Harrison Ford's performance as Rick Dickered. He played the role of the Blade Runner perfectly. Sean Young as Racheal was able to convince me that she is a ""Replicant"". In my opinion, anyone who played the role of a ""Replicant"" in the film, did it more than well and they all convinced me.Jordan Cronenweth's cinematography was great and it was able to capture the futuristic world in a way that'll blow your mind especially when it comes to showing buildings that had these futuristic/beautiful billboards, or even the flying cars. This brings me to the production design that worked so well alongside the cinematography to capture this beautiful big world.Loved how the film left us with so many unanswered questions (that even most of them aren't answered in the sequel ""Blade Runner 2049""). Because this makes the film more debatable and we get to hear the different theories and opinions.Great film that introduced us to a beautiful, big, complex, and futuristic world. It had a great cast & crew that delivered a film that lives for years.My rating is 9.5/10.""Time to die""",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Great set design & atmosphere, poorly paced & weak action","This movie historically has helped shaped the entire sci-fi genre, creating the ""cyberpunk"" futuristic atmosphere which many other media gained inspiration from. The set design, atmosphere, background extras, etc. Is amazing. Even watching it in 2023, I was amazed by the amount of work put into the set design to give the streets a more dark and futuristic cyberpunk look. I watched this film a long time ago as a kid and I nearly forgot that I watched it, but I rewatched the remastered version recently and remembered it again. There is literally zero sunlight and it's always dark due to the decades of human activity causing the sky to be covered up (nuclear war) and all animals are extinct except for artificially made animals. And there's neon lights everywhere, and large neon advertisement signs that make up for the dark skies. There's also a lot of Asians and Asian themes used in the movie which is looks very cool. Young Harrison Ford did a phenomenal job acting and played his role well, and so did all of the other lead actors. The Blade Runner story was originally from the legendary sci-fi writer, Philip K. Dick. The concept of the story was very captivating, especially for its time.However, aside from the beautiful set design and atmosphere, the movie was a little slow and the action sequences weren't very good. I do try to forgive the film a little due to the fact that it was made in 1982, but I thought to myself that it they could put in the hard work to make such beautiful sets, they could have choreographed better fight scenes and action scenes. For example, when Harrison Ford's character was chasing a replicant in the busy streets, it wasn't really too epic and I felt it could have been more thrilling. And also, the final fight in the movie was also far from epic, though it was the best action in the whole movie. At the beginning of the movie, it got me very excited about the story but I was basically waiting and waiting until the good part of the movie comes and it never came (which kind of made the movie feel short because I was just anticipating for some good action or story). Even the 1975 Jaws movie had way better action, and it was a movie about a killer shark... And Star Wars came out in 1977. So I'm sure the action and direction of the movie could've been better. If this movie was made in 2023 but with different actors and updated technology and kept the exact same plot and story, it would have gotten a pretty low rating... so the good ratings for the 1982 Blade Runner movie was due to other things about the film.Obviously, there are also a lot of let's say ""outdated concepts"" in this movie, such as the actor who played that old Asian man who obviously doesn't look like an Asian man (maybe Middle Eastern, West Asian looking but not Japanese), this is typically known as ""yellow face"". There was an old Asian lady in the movie (who was actually Asian) who had a speaking role, but the camera did not focus on her face while she was speaking which was a little weird. And of course the uncomfortable kissing scene with Harrison Ford's character (which I'm not sure if that was something normal back in 1982 when men force women to kiss). So these were just some weird minor things about the movie but I try to forgive the film due to it being made in a different time. I am surprised at least the film used a lot of Asian extras in the background and Asian imagery (Japanese neon signs and ads, Japanese restaurants, etc.).Overall, I still like the film due to the beautiful set design, atmosphere, and themes. The concept of the story was very good, but it just didn't play out very well in this film. The Blade Runner films do spark my imagination about a futuristic cyberpunk world with flying cars and dark skyscraper cities with lots of neon lights, but I wished the film did a better job with the story and action.. considering it is a movie about cops chasing after human robots.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Good film,"Good film. There are many cast members in smaller roles that I am not familiar with, even if they are/were also prolific actors. But one mention goes out to Sean Young, who plays the maybe most interesting character from this film. Easily the most stunning though I would say. Daryl Hannah's character is called ""perfect"" on one occasion by another character, but I could not disagree more. Young is perfect here in my opinion. Then again, I have always had a soft spot for dark-haired girls, so certainly biased here. So I mentioned Hannah now, she was very young here of course and most people are also familiar with her from the Kill Bill films and I must admit I did not even remember she was in this film here although, especially with the makeup, her character here is pretty memorable and interesting too. The scene right before the fight when she is in disguise in a similar manner like Bond going against Scaramanga was nice too, but Ford/Deckard is too much of a professional to not spot her quickly, even if he is still taken by surprise by her.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A Review: by Me,"Before I begin, let me state that I am writing this movie review because my teacher assigned me to. However, the following statements are my honest opinions. In this of Blade Runner review, I will be discussing three different topics: aesthetics, costuming, and setting.
Throughout the entire movie, one thing that really stood out to me was the overall aesthetics of the film. Everything is dark. Most of the lighting is dark and heavily plays on shadows. The weather is also gloomy, and the presence of rain further darkens most scenes. The entire movie is colored by shades of black and gray. For example, in the scenes where Rick is walking through streets, most of the buildings are gray, and they loom over the people walking below them. Rick's apartment also competes for the title of darkest setting in the movie. The walls are painted gray, and the corners are dark enough to conceal a person. However, the gloomiest, darkest, grayest (if that's a word), most depressing scene is the rooftop fight scene, where Roy speaks his last words. The message delivered here, that memories will eventually fade, is just as dark as the aesthetics. The lighting and scenery accompanies the darkness of the theme of Blade Runner.
The people of Blade Runner are dressed mostly in black, allowing characters to retreat into shadows. The black attire is so uniform, that I almost feel like there's a rule that outlaws colorful clothes or that all characters are stuck in their middle school emo phases. Although, I do understand how the dark clothes help push the theme and aesthetics of the movie. I do like how the main fashion trend is sort of a 1940's rich white woman meets a 1990's leather jacket wearing teenager. The costumes help draw attention to the importance of the characters in the movie. Rachel's dress is exactly that- her dress. The structure fits her perfectly and allows her to make a silent statement when she enters a scene. Rick wears a long leather coat that adds drama to action scenes.
Lastly, I wanted to compare the setting of Blade Runner with today. The movie is set in 2019, and is it currently 2019... This is kind of like the whole Back to the Future comparison. Obviously, the writers and producers didn't see 2019 being that dark and uniform, but the robot aspect might have been expected. The film came out in 1982, so the prediction of creating some sort of robotic human within 40 years is reasonable. We do have bionic prosthetics and Hanson Robotic's Sophia, but our robotic development isn't as realistic as predicted in Blade Runner. They also have an underlying theme that in this version of the future, people aren't really individuals with a purpose. At this point, most people are just living because they're alive. I find it ironic that the people who really value their memories and lives are the robots.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"The Future is mean, ugly...and rather dull.","Well, I guess I must have totally missed the point again... I did not see a Sci-Fi masterpiece with astonishingly progressive visual effects and a flawlessly adapted screenplay, but an over-ambitious and difficult to digest drama epic with a lack of action. But hey, ""Blade Runner"" is ranked pretty high in the IMDb top 250 and all the professional reviews are singing praise, so my humble opinion is probably something you shouldn't bother to read. Although, for the record, the only version I've seen is the original theatrical version and  supposedly  only the 1992 director's cut version is a genuine masterpiece. Unquestionably terrific is Ridley Scott's portrayal of our world by the year 2019, when the cities look exactly like predicted in Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" with immense 300-storey skyscrapers and pure decay down below on the streets. The future is ugly and petrifying and it looks like nobody can smile anymore. In this sad and unappealing universe, Rick Deckard is an early retired ""Blade Runner"" whose duty was to eliminate android fugitives, called Replicants, that escaped from extraterrestrial colonies. Deckard is called back because four of the most dangerous Replicants are on an earthly mission to increase their miserable life-span of only four years. The film's biggest disappointment  other than the tiresome voice over by Ford and the dreadful jazzy soundtrack  are the characterizations of these android Replicants. Supposedly they're relentless villains that already made over 30 casualties on their way over to earth, yet when they're face to face with their enemies  humans  they don't look the least bit menacing or dangerous at all! Neither do they evoke feeling of understanding or sympathy, they just behave like philosophical talkers; especially the ""leader"" Roy Batty. The love-story sequences between Ford and robotic beauty Sean Young feel like pure melodramatic padding whereas sublime actors in intriguing supportive roles (M. Emmet Walsh, Edward James Olmos) are criminally underused. The film may be rich on themes and symbolism, but the lack of excitement is saddening and the ending is unforgivably weak.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A future that's more apparent since 9-11-2001,"A bleak Los Angeles skyline where advertising is omnipresent; can it be in 1982 this was viewed as the future of one of America's great cities?  Times Square in New York City did resemble an OmniVision-like version of this but since Tuesday at 9 a.m. EDT the rubble of the leveled twin World Center Towers now lies massed in heaps.  If the United States was conquered by some sort of dominant hybrid empire that had robotics and genetic cloning, then the urban anonymity and anarchy of this film's back-story might be possible. Given the rush toward world economic markets and the entry of the China populace/workforce into a 21st century non-natural environment, a transformed California is not that inconceivable.  Will urban policing become as vigilante as BLADE RUNNER seems to imply?  The ""leap"" from the National Defense/Local Law Enforcement/FBI/CIA that was necessitated by the anti-terrorist actions taken this week across the nation and internationally also make this scenario of 2019 look a bit closer rather than farther away. Will our technology pull us up as we hang ""over the edge""?  BLADE RUNNER may seem negative and ultra-violent but what will endure and what will threaten the future of humanity?  Frankenstein?

what's all the hub-bub? Strictly second rate sci-fi,"The casting is atrocious.

This film could've possibly been saved if Harrison Ford had been replaced as the lead. I've never seen him perform an acceptable acting job, and Blade Runner is no exception. I heard someone comment on the philosophy of this movie... Puh-lease. All in all, worse sci-fi movies have been made; that's not the point.

A great film despite or maybe because of Scott's presence,"In the past I have said that this is a film that manages to be great despite the presence of Ridley Scott as the director. I have thought about it some more and realized I was wrong. This is an absolutely text book case of a film that is great BECAUSE Scott was the director. It's virtues are Scott's virtues as a director, and everything that holds it back from being a true masterpiece is due to Scott's deficits.Scott is amazing visual stylist. So much so that he clearly doesn't care that much about plot and characters, and will sacrifice clarity in favour of cool visuals. This film is a masterpiece of visual design. The effects and design work is so good that it still feels current 40 years later.The plot is a mess. It's not a disaster, but it's full of holes and the characters are underwritten. It's a tribute to several of the actors that their performances are so good ... Rutger Hauer in particular ... that they make up for a lot of the deficiencies. Could this have been even greater in the hands of a director who cared enough to hammer out the plot more? Maybe not. Maybe you needed someone with Scott's insane attention to detail to make this work at all.This film is fascinating example of how authorial intent can just utterly fail in something as complex as filmmaking. I don't think Scott is a great example of an auteurist director, but playing along with him for a while, he repeatedly claims that what he says about this film is authoritative. I don't agree with him. He clearly does not understand his own film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

I would definitely recommend to really sit down and watch this without distractions. It doesn't have any crazy effects and eye catching scenes, but this is an old movie and understandable. It was made for the storyline and is light years ahead of its time. There are many twists and turns throughout the movie and quite some surprises you won't see coming.

"great focus on details, less of a focus on action","In reviewing the film Blade Runner, made in 1982, it is interesting to look at the time period it was meant to portray. It was made to be set in 2019, and it being 2019 currently makes this movie appealing to look into. Even though this movie did not accurately predict what present day society would be like, the movie did an amazing job of portraying a futuristic society. From immense skyscrapers to flying cars to replicants of people, the audience is made to believe this alternate universe will exist in the future regardless of when this future may be. This movie largely focuses on this in depth future and details of the society and less on conflict between characters. The movie does not have as much action as I was expecting considering that Harrison Ford's, Deckard's, mission was to eliminate the existing replicants on Earth. Personally, I thought the build up to conflict between characters was slow because of the large focus on setting the mood for the film and society. The setting of this movie was gloomy and mysterious. This is set through the constant rain and dim lighting in the film. Since most of the movie is dark and in the shadows, the points of the movie that are illuminated show their importance in regards to a visual appeal. I also feel like the characters add to the mood of the movie in a beneficial way. Deckard's mindset and personality in the movie is very bland which may stem from the idea presented at the end of the movie. Other characters like Tyrell also seem very emotionless in the film. His role as an intellectual and designer of the replicants is accurately portrayed through his bland emotion. Another way the tone is set in the movie is through the soundtrack. The majority of the music in the film contains a saxophone and does a very good job at portraying mystery along with showing the goal of Deckard trying to complete his mission. This music combined with the characters as well as the tone portrayed through the setting contribute to the gloomy society that is meant to be depicted. I personally think that this mood is executed well and I think that these features are the highlights of the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

A beautiful nightmare,"Pauline Kael was dead wrong when she argued you could totally get a movie on the first viewing. BLADE RUNNER is one such movie which only deepens with every viewing. I've come to find that the way I approach the movie has changed so much from when I first saw it years ago-- elements I originally viewed as flaws, such as Deckard being far less sympathetic and engaging than his replicant quarry, are actually strengths. That Deckard is more machine-like and cold than his prey is precisely part of the point the film is making about humanity in the modern world, not unlike HAL 9000 being far more human than the flesh and blood human beings in 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.Beyond that, BLADE RUNNER is a triumph of worldbuilding and atmosphere. Both the gloomy, ethereal Vangellis score and the smoky, noir visuals combine to create the most beautiful nightmarescape ever put on-screen. There's something hypnotic about BLADE RUNNER, though this very quality pretty much demands that you need to be in the proper mood to watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

over rated but still fun to look at,"The artwork by futurist and designer Syd Mead is this movie. Many of the drawings that were used to create the sets in this film are available on the web and I think they are worth looking at as Syd Mead has got good talent when it comes to creating interesting looking futuristic panoramas. I thought the script of the film was middling to very weak, and the end sequences were not very enjoyable to watch, taking the film down a kind of black hole, compared to the interesting scenes in the beginning and in the middle of the film. I was surprised to see multiple versions released a few years ago in a sort of pricey box set, as the versions differ only slightly. I did some research and learnt that Sir Run Run Shaw, credited in the film, is a Chinese media mogul, who must have been around 90 when the film Blade Runner was made. I have read a not bad sequel, but there seems to be no interest in creating a movie sequel based on the book sequel, which I think is kind of sad, because despite the often dim witted script, the film had interesting visuals. People who think this is the best thing ever made visually should explore more SF art, particularly the work of Jim Burns. With a better script this would be an easy ten, but as it stands it sounds like fifth rate detective fiction from the 1940s, so I gave it a seven, not a four.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Gritty Enigma,"I have seen several movies in my time, too many really. But this one has a big question mark over its head. Unexplained blue's and philosophical mishaps can question its existence. The existence of people that is. The point that the movie is trying to get across is life is precious. Phillip K Dick and Riddley Scott had the same intent.Excellent acting done by Harrison Ford and the replicants (Sean young, Rutgar Hauer, Daryl hannah, Joanna Cassidy, and the deceased Brion James.) They're acting is good enough to provoke a sensitive look on what the intent of the story was. Excellent lighting to form a gritty look on the future in 2019. Skyscraping buildings portray an excellent set decoration that should have won the oscar in 1982.Perfection by Art decoration in the urban streets of LA 2019. This movie also shows how much pollution the world has left behind. Constant acid rain, garbage, smoke etc. It depicts very well how careless humans can be to the minds of others. Who knows maybe we will suck up every resource on this earth and have to move to another planet to colonize.Excellent director Ridley Scott who brought you Alien, Thelma and Louise, and Gladiator. This Movie is derived from the novel ""Do androids dream of electric sheep."" It sounds kind of off ended but you will know what it means after seeing this movie. Very good plot and visual effects that should have wiped out E.T. in the oscars but before 1991 Blade Runner was stuck with a voice over narration by Harrison Ford which removed its dark noir inquiry.When you watch the movie you can tell how even the replicants can have biological ""FAKE"" emotions.But the question you must ask yourself is, is it moral to the humain protocal. When they are being retired they hang on to their life as much as we do. Their struggle till their last drop of sweat is out of their blood and they mearily colapse to the powerful impact of a 38. magnum. Should creations we make ourself that initiate to environment we collapse to their knee's and receive enforcement.The movie is the best portrayer of that senario only in a dark un-narrated fashion. Adamant reactions is what Gadhi had although in this futuristic sci-fi noir the only possetion is a story to tell. The damask rose and oragami figures are the symbols that personify the reactions and co-essence of humans and their genetic creations.The only way to understand is to try and interpret Blade Runner Or ""do androids dream of electric sheep"" by Phillip K. Dick. Questions still arise and vivid deciphering of what the novel meant is still oblivious to us.The Directing, set direction/art direction, and music by Vangelis vives a perfect atmosphere for this movie.

Ridley Scott's best,"With its bleak tone, omnipresent rain and tough-yet-vulnerable protagonist, Blade Runner is a film only a man raised in Newcastle-upon-Tyne could have made (said as one myself). Ridley Scott's film succeeds on many levels, most notably its beautiful aesthetic; the vivid, metallic cinematography set the visual template that thousands of mostly inferior blockbusters have since adopted. However, the thing that elevates this film above the rest is that its beauty is not exclusive to its visuals - the sound-scape, storyline and symbolism are also outstanding in their execution. One thing that the film does particularly well is to draw you into its world to the point where you almost forget that you're watching it on a screen. This is done partially with the outstanding set design, but also through the background sounds. The noises of rain, traffic and the city imitate perfectly the sounds of a real city - they constantly suggest that the world you are watching does not end just outside the frame, but encompasses an entire metropolis. On top of impressive acting and a strong story, the use of religious imagery often lends extra weight to already powerful scenes. Costume design, such as Batty's oddly white hair (a reflection of his unnaturally rapid ageing), also helps us to understand what the characters are thinking about and struggling with. Overall, Blade Runner is one of those rare films that seems to succeed in every category - few movies will ever match the brilliance of this one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

I get it was made in the 80s, so I can't be too harsh when it comes to special effects. Hell, the special effects weren't even my issue with it. The story sounded like it could be good. But everything else - between dialogue, action scenes, and pacing - were just terrible. It took me about two days to watch it because I kept having to stop it to take a break from it and do something else. I figured with as bad as it was it was probably directed by some no name director. Then I found out it was directed by Ridley Scott.

The best sci-fi movie ever made? I think so.,"Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, for me, is the be all and end all of science-fiction pictures. Adapted from Phillip K. Dick's 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, Blade Runner's history is one of a legendarily troubled shoot, and egregious financial disappointment. However, like some other films that experienced such stressful and humble beginnings and ultimately grew in importance and popularity with each passing decade (like Citizen Kane, The Shawshank Redemption, The Wizard of Oz and It's a Wonderful Life), Blade Runner's esteem now with film critics and audiences alike shows that in 1982 it was simply a movie that was decades ahead of its time.Blade Runner is as visually awe-inspiring a movie as you will ever see. Justifiably celebrated for its mesmerizing production design, Scott and his crew, also putting to work visual effects that don't show 26 years, paint a wrenching but no less aesthetically pleasing portrait of what maybe 2019 Los Angeles will look like: dystopic, polluted and brimming with corruption and corporate greed. You could only hope to see such amazing eye-candy from a director who is arguably one of the last true visionary directors (that now being a term which, it seems, is thrown around nearly as much these days in Hollywood circles as ""You'll never work in this town again!"").But therein does not lie that magic ingredient that makes Blade Runner the seminal masterpiece of science-fiction film-making – that is in two other aspects of the story. The first of those is its ocean-deep and universal themes. Blade Runner is a movie that challenges the viewer to ponder not only what it means to be human, but WHY we are human. Through the central characters of Deckard (the central male whom we know more about than he knows of himself), played by Harrison Ford, Rachael (the female replicant and love interest of Deckard's who is the most advanced of her kind but still knows only mortality), played by Sean Young, and Roy Batty (the revengeful replicant who wages war on both Deckard and his own maker), played by Rutger Hauer, Blade Runner is a timeless, universal and marvelous analysis and deconstruction of the human condition in all its dimensions. And the characterizations by Ford, Young and most notably Hauer all leave indelible impressions.Also broadening the narrative scope of the film is the mind-boggling fusion of postmodern cyberpunk and future neo-noir. This adds yet another layer of beauty and intrigue, especially in Vangelis' instantly recognizable score and with the cynical and introverted Deckard feeling much like a role Humphrey Bogart might have accepted.The second definitive sign of Blade Runner's colossal greatness lies in its cautionary tale view of the future – and in 2009, unlike 1982, we all know how alarming the possibility of it successfully predicting the future is. After all, 2019 is only 11 years away. Pollution, slavery, prostitution, global warming, corruption. Technological enslavement? Think about that the next time you buy a piece of audiovisual equipment or even the next time you fire up your computer. Good sci-fi always tries to predict the future. Only the very best get it right.In summary, you can throw 2001: A Space Odyssey or Metropolis or even The Matrix at me, but in my book, with its ageless eye-candy, its questions about life and human nature, and its gritty yet all-too-possible prediction of the future, Blade Runner is the definitive science-fiction movie of all time.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"Slightly Overrated, not boring, but not too masterful, it somehow falls in between","Blade Runner 1982 is one of those movies which take place in the future, with a vast boost of scientific and digital evolution.
Surprisingly, the concept was pretty good, but the movie could've been shortened to 1h30m, it felt so slow and underwhelming in many parts.
One of the biggest weaknesses is, it felt so incoherent, between each part and another, and how 'this' led to 'that', a viewer would be all confused
Now, to logic, the plot wasn't so 'heroic', so that's a pro, but the con is, it didn't feel anything special type thing at all.
This movie plays the role of bedrock for Blade Runner 2049. So it's a must-see-first.

The storyline is not perfect,  but raises many questions about mortality,  and human nature. Sure,  it's well enough acted,  and the score fits with the atmosphere. But the thing that Scott has done most succesfully was to make Los Angeles 2019 a convincing place.Rutger Hauer's 'Tears in the Rain' dialogue at the end is moving,  even after seeing many times.This film is possibly my favourite film of all time.

More Human Than Human,"The whole cyberpunk / neo-noir genre has roots in one sole experience, that being the classic 1982 film Blade Runner. It is a film that was an unfortunate sleeper hit which didn't perform well on its initial theatric release. Here is my editorial review of Blade Runner, 30+ years later.Blade Runner is set in the futuristic visage of 2019 Los Angeles, which has been dominated by mega-corporations and consumerism. A concentrated group of synthetic, human-like androids (referred to in-film as Replicants) have disobeyed their orders and illegally arrived back to Earth for their own purposes. An LAPD officer and ""Blade Runner"" called Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) has been instructed by his superiors to track down and ""retire"" these rogue Replicants.To start things off, Blade Runner has an amazing visual style that has become well-known throughout the course of cinema. The city of Los Angeles itself looks otherworldly, yet oddly familiar when we delve deeper into the bustling city streets laden with corporate marketing and heavy traffic. The darkened cloudy aesthetics are hugely reminiscent of old-school noir films, this is also accented by the beautiful, atmospheric & synth-heavy soundtrack performed by Vangelis. On top of everything else, the cinematography is bold and stylish - and gives us a good look into this lovingly-detailed futuristic world. In summary, Blade Runner has a grimy, sleek style that looks wondrous in comparison to other sci-fi epics.The storyline takes on a hunter / hunted approach, which gives us the impression that both the humans and Replicants are ultimately two sides of the same coin. This whole idea is further cemented throughout the film, and leads us to further questions that are ultimately left ambiguous by the time the film is over. There's a great sense of mystery, even some elements of fear and sadness that become apparent as the film's plot progresses.There is but one thing that stops Blade Runner from being the perfect film, and that is the ridiculous amount of cuts that were made since its original release in 1982. There have been a total of 7 official cuts made for this film, some of which omit the gratuitous violence that is needed to keep the story and sense of direction in-balance. I would personally advise newcomers to watch the final cut for the full Blade Runner experience, especially since it's the cut that Ridley Scott himself is the most fond of.This films scores a high 9/10 for me personally, I strongly admire Blade Runner's sense of scope and incredibly unique atmosphere which was unlike anything else ever seen at that point. Up until this film's release, sci-fi films that the notorious distinction of being cheaply-made and quick to produce, but Blade Runner was the antithesis of that statement.I would recommend this film for fans of sci-fi epics such as Star Wars and other Ridley Scott films such as Alien. Blade Runner can also be enjoyable for fans of the cyberpunk / neo-noir genres.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Unique, engaging, moody, visually striking, thought-provoking","It's funny. I've only seen this movie once and it was years ago and just on a computer screen and yet the movie is exactly the same as I remember. Either I have an incredible memory or Blade Runner has some magical quality that makes it unforgettable.The tone makes this movie. The feel of it, the way it washes over you and stays with you afterwards is more significant than the story itself. It's dark and somewhat gloomy. But not depressing, just kind of sad or contemplative. It's refreshing that it's not trying to be funny or deep or clever. It just tells its story matter-of-factly. It weighs down on you over time. There are no light moments of comic relief (although there is plenty of subtle humour). That kind of tension is enjoyable when so many films are impatient and predictable.It raises interesting questions about artificial life. What would it be like to realise that you were actually an android? A bit like Dark City and The Matrix, you have to ask yourself what you really know for sure. Are your memories real? Is that air you're breathing? The steady pace of the film allows you to fill the quiet moments with your own thoughts and considerations. It allows you to meditate on these themes, this futuristic world which we might one day live in.Blade Runner could be one of the most influential films ever made. It's visual style is incredible. It's Gothic, dream-like, iconic and other things that I'm not good at describing. Many of the shots seem to have an immediate emotional or psychological impact, they mesmerise or relax you in some way. They sear into your memory. The music by Vangelis is also gorgeous and haunting. It fits with (or maybe sets) the mood of the movie perfectly.Perhaps loneliness is another theme of Blade Runner. Deckard doesn't seem to have any family or friends. He doesn't say much. He doesn't smile or laugh or cry (nor do most of the characters). But you always have an intuitive sense of what he's thinking or feeling. Maybe the simplicity of the character is what makes him more believable and easy to relate to - we can project ourselves onto him.The replicants sometimes show more emotion than the human characters. Sean Young is beautiful, her eyes are always alive even as her body is still. Rutger Hauer makes a very cool, fascinating villain. He is so calm and gentlemanly and yet ominous (a bit like Bane) and says so many poetic and insightful lines. It makes you wonder, what is humanity anyway? Why are we sad when someone dies? Did God create us with a purpose? Why did he give us our flaws?I felt some of the violence was over-the-top and unnecessary. It didn't add to the story. But at least this isn't Prometheus.Blade Runner is a must-see as far as movies go. It has similarities to so many other movies I can think of and yet it came out before all of them. It's a vivid sci-fi, film noir story. I have to give it a 10 because it is so unique and made me feel things I haven't felt in years. Feelings that are hard to put into words but which fill me with wonder about life's questions and make me feel more alive.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"Still a masterpiece (for cinema and arts in general, not just within the SF and neo-noir movie genres)","I can only repeat what others have written already: ""A Milestone Of Science Fiction And A Cyberpunk Masterpiece ""Visually stunning for a movie made in the early 80s, the movie covers deep philosophical questions facing humanity in the 21st century (mega-corporations ruling over gig economy workers, environmental destruction, genetic engineering...) and what it means to be human.In short: A Timeless classic.The movie may feel a bit slow for today's audience but it's worth giving the plot time to unfold and to pick up the details (especially the gorgeous visuals, the visual overload almost requires a second or even a third viewing).If you watch(ed) other SF films released post-1982, including many Anime and music videos, you will see the huge influence Blade Runner had on character designs and settings.I will go even further: Blade Runner (it's worth repeating that it was released back in 1982 already) still feels very ahead of its time even decades later and is one of three most influential SF movies of all time in my opinion, along with:Metropolis (1927)2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)Add the first Star Wars movie from 1977 and the original Matrix movie (1999) if you want a list of five movies with two more successful (in terms of box office) works. Or swap these two additions for niche movies such as La Jetée (1962) or Brazil (1985) if you want to exclude blockbuster/mainstream examples.PS: Watch both the original theatrical release (1982) and then the Final Cut (released in 2007) of Blade Runner to find out which one suits you better (in this order). Finally, I also recommend the sequel Blade Runner 2049 released in 2017. Make sure you don't skip the three short films as an introduction to the sequel, sort of a story bridge from the original Blade Runner:2036: Nexus Dawn (2017)2048: Nowhere to Run (2017)Blade Runner Black Out 2022 (2017)These three short films are available for free online and are also included in many disc releases of Blade Runner 2049.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
More Human Than Human,"Blade Runner is my all-time favorite movie. I saw it in the theaters when it first came out and was so transfixed by the experience I stayed and watched it a second time. Since then I have watched it countless times and own the deluxe Blu-Ray version. This film has the perfect combination of a great director, perfect cast, story by Philip K. Dick, film noire setting, soundtrack by Vangelis and amazing special effects. The combination is a perfect storm that simply must be experienced by any fan of science fiction. It's amazing what Ridley Scott achieved using essentially in-camera special effects like models and rotoscope.I'm a huge fan of Philip K. Dick, and despite being a loose adaptation, the film is a great rendering of ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" I don't require films made from a book to be perfect, word-for-word renditions of the story and I was delighted by this rendition of Dick's story. I'm a sucker for stories about artificial intelligence and what it really means to be human. I also love stories that at the end leave you wondering about crucial plot points. Blade Runner hits the mark on both these points. I have carefully written this review to reveal no spoilers, so you'll have to watch the movie to see what I mean.There are a few different versions that do not have as ""soft"" of an ending as the original theatrical release, but I like the Directors Cut the most. This film went on to strongly influence nearly every science fiction film produced since it was released. A classic, must-see film!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

My Replicant's Palms Are a Little Sweaty...,After a lifetime of drinking in echoes of this film from every conceivable angle it's genuinely deeply hard to watch it and separate it from all the cultural baggage. It feels like nothing more than a slightly existential spin on a 1940's noir (with no change to the grim sexual politics) set in a bewilderingly complex and stylised dystopian future that still feels fresh and vibrant. It still feels like something beamed directly from another time which is a remarkable feat - I can see why it has the influence it does but quite honestly more than anything I was just psyched to see a young EB from Deadwood.

Layers Upon Layers Of Visual Beauty!!! A Sci-fi Cult Classic.,"""BLADE RUNNER"" wow where to begin? I think everything that can possibly be said about this Masterpiece of Cinema has already been written & discussed about for years & years now!!!I will just say that this is still my favourite HARRISON FORD movie & it's Director Ridley Scott's Masterpiece of Cinema, also the late great RUTGER HAUER was magnificent in his iconic role & he's cemented in the Hollywood Hall of Fame & a piece of Cinema History for his performance here!!!The legendary Harrison Ford is also iconic & excellent here as Replicant Hunter Detective ""Deckard"" & he is amazing on screen & created probably the most famous movie Detective of all time as he investigates deeper in to the dark Noir infused, smokey & rain drenched streets of the futuristic Los City, the cinematography & look of this film are unmatched by anything else in the sci-fi genre since!!! All aspects of this production are flawless, the special effects are still breathtakingly beautiful as is the truly beautiful, haunting & emotional soundtrack by Vengelis, that soundtrack album is a Masterpiece in itself!!!The performance from Ford is fantastic as he's a tough Detective but is also clearly lost & seems to not know his place in this dark future he's in & he plays it perfectly.It's a real treat watching this Classic as it's layers upon layers of visual beauty. The dark & dreamlike future world of Blade Runner sucks you in & doesn't let go until the thrilling conclusion. Really a masterful work of filmmaking here & one that is truly a Classic of Cinema.I adore ""Blade Runner"" & it's one of my all time favourite movies, it's still exciting every single time i rewatch this Classic.The dark themes of a lost world & the ever changing times & our reliance on technology is always more & more relevant each day.Blade Runner is a timeless classic.But put aside all the relevance stuff & hidden meanings, themes & messages, as this is still a great futuristic Detective Thriller with some Amazing scenes & stunning set pieces, a wonderful movie of the highest quality.I love BladeRunner, a great Detective story in a futuristic world.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
all this film has going for it is the production d...,"all this film has going for it is the production design. This movie is dreary, ugly, and very pessimistic. The buildings of the future are very huge and advanced, but the people in the film are all depressed and cynical. Harrison Ford gives the worst performance of his career. It is hard to see why this film is praised so much by people. The storytelling is totally muddled and terribly hard to follow. You might think I should watch this film again to appreciate it, but I won't. That's the last thing I would do. Watching the film for me was painful. And what's with that scene were the bad guy kills some other guy by squishing his eyes out and crushing his skull? Couldn't he have killed in another way?This film has no redeeming features whatsoever apart from the aforementioned set designs, which are quite inventive. The characters are all far from interesting. All actors give flat, superficial performances. The story is extremely depressing. I can't recommend this film at all.

"Visual feast, gorgeous music, memorable scenes","No spoilers as always, just some coded references.A bit of watch-history, if I may: I first saw Blade Runner as a kid, a kid who loved and repeat-watched Star Wars (the original trilogy, naturally). Back then I wasn't impressed by Blade Runner at all, probably because I was expecting Han Solo rather than the introverted action we get with the Ridley Scott film.Then I saw it again as a young adult, and appreciated it a lot more. It still felt slightly detached, a bit cool (the cold kind), but I understood it much better.Almost 20 years later I finally get round to watching it a third time. Kubrick's 2001 has a very similar watch-history, and upon its third-viewing just a few weeks ago I declared it my Number 1 favourite film, giving it an easy 10/10 (only 7 of my 700 rated films are a 10).As a sci-fi fan I was fully expecting Blade Runner to similarly WOW me...alas, it somehow fell just a bit short. That cool, detached vibe was still there. The scenes, as memorable as they are, just sort of happen without much viewer connection (especially the famous final speech). The Final Cut version - first time I've seen this edition - has a couple of jarring edits which added to this odd feeling (check out how the edit cuts after the nose-pulling scene, and another example how after Batty says to JF: ""I'm sorry, Sebastian. Come...come"" it cuts immediately to Roy looking all theatrical, but alone, in a completely different setting.Add those odd vibes to the overlong romantic scene in the middle of the movie, which just felt tortuously slow, and truly cheesy too, thanks to the only piece of soundtrack music which has dated horribly...Kenny G has a lot to answer for.This 'disconnect' is the reason it can't touch 2001 (which has a very different quality of 'disconnect'). Saying that, Blade Runner is still worth a very good and entirely recommended 8/10:this is one of cinema's best-realised future worlds. It's believable & immersive to the point you can almost taste the air.great cast, with characters that reveal their colour over time...like a fine wine.aside from that awful misplaced sax, the soundtrack is gorgeous, and fits the world perfectly.the ""is he or isn't he"" ambiguity is nicely done, tho' I wouldn't even call it ambiguous (he ""is"", and so is Adama).there's a large handful of memorable scenes, even if you do feel weirdly disconnected to what's happening, you'll still enjoy the surreal vibes.Best to watch it when you're feeling that world, if the first 30 minutes don't pull you in then leave it for another day.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Falls short of Philip K. Dick's brilliant novel,"""Blade Runner"" is an enjoyable and 'solid' sci-fi film. However having read Philip K. Dick's novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"", upon which the film is based, I was left somewhat disappointed/wanting more. (Inevitable I guess, given the calibre of Dick's writing.)I accept that film adaptations of original written works typically sacrifice some plot threads and/or character details in order to produce a coherent film of an appropriate length. However ""Blade Runner"" really would have benefited from a better 'sketch' of the futuristic world in which the characters live (I mean in terms of plot rather than visual detail), and a tad more time spent establishing the background and motivations of Rick Deckard (the bounty hunter) and the androids he pursues.That said, the film is visually impressive and boasts good performances from Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer and Sean Young.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Good film,"Good film. The sets are elaborate and beautifully constructed. Yet the lighting is low-key and the atmosphere is filled with smoke, giving it that neo-noir touch. So this is not your conventional science-fiction movie. There are no spaceship battles or goofy robots. Harrison Ford is not playing Han Solo from the ""Star Wars"" movies; this is totally different. The performances are good all-around. But I will still say that the film does drag. I would edit a portion out of almost every scene. It's obvious that Ridley Scott didn't have the pacing in mind. And what was with that boring soundtrack?Still 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Still Running Strong After All These Years!,"""Blade Runner,"" Ridley Scott's iconic 1982 sci-fi masterpiece, is a film that transcends time with its thematic depth and stunning visual design. Having immersed myself in all the various cuts of the movie, I can confidently say that each version provides a unique experience worth exploring.From the original U. S. Theatrical Cut with its voice-over narration to the more enigmatic Director's Cut, each rendition adds different textures to the story of Rick Deckard, a Blade Runner tracking down synthetic beings known as replicants. But it is the Final Cut, hailed by many, that stands as the most cohesive and definitive vision of the film. Scott's meticulous craftsmanship reaches its peak here, harmonizing all the elements that make ""Blade Runner"" an enduring classic.Visually, ""Blade Runner"" is a triumph. Yes, by today's standards, some shots-such as those flying over the dystopian cityscape-may seem dated. But what remains impressive is the film's ability to create a believable and immersive world without relying on CGI. Utilizing miniatures, matte paintings, and carefully designed sets, the film's visual aesthetics hold up remarkably well, echoing a time when practical effects were the vanguard of filmmaking.Whether you're a newcomer to the world of ""Blade Runner"" or revisiting it, there's value in exploring each cut of the film. Yet, if you were to choose one version to encapsulate the entire essence of this groundbreaking work, the Final Cut would be the ideal choice. Its blend of story, character depth, and visual artistry illustrates why ""Blade Runner"" continues to be a beacon of cinematic excellence.""",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Incredible visuals with a drawn-out plot,"I had absolutely no idea what the movie was going to be about, nor did I have any expectations, considering the movie is from 1982! I had only generally heard in the info-field about these movies, but rather even about the second film with Ryan Gosling. This movie, 1982, surprised me on one side, and on the other, it was expected what I could get out of it. It's worth noting that I watched the director's version in 4K, HDR and Dolby Vision, but there are other versions out there that are considered less canonical.This movie, I believe, was one of the most innovative in terms of a bunch of new things in its years. Great graphics. The picture and the shot staging are good. The music, with synths that were just starting to catch on in the world, is wonderful. The atmosphere is very good.The SFX particles, in the form of flames in general plans, certainly stand out in the graphics. The audio gets monophonic in some places. The acting by some of the actors is not the best. The movie drags, but here more because of the not so good plot (but I can admit, with ideas), which is also because of the specific narrative in the feature 1982 it began to look more old-fashioned.Nowadays, you can see that the plot has aged, a bit visually as well. It seems to me that although the film has gained cult status, the film as a whole is overrated. If you wish, you can watch it as I did to see the next movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Overhyped!,"Blade Runner is considered a masterpiece of science fiction cinema and I can see why visually anyone would be foolish to disagree-the noir look is gorgeous, almost like a beautiful, tragic painting of a dying civilization. But the film is a misery to sit through partly because the characters are unrelatable. Harrison Ford's Deckard is dull and looks bored throughout the film and his chemistry with Sean Young is nonexistent. The plot is too high brow and all but the most ardent followers of hard thinking man's science fiction would be impressed. This is a classic example of overpraised piece of work.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A dreamland dystopia where humanity has been absorbed by its own disastrous creations.,"This is, quite simply, the best Sci-Fi movie ever made, and one of the finest movies of any genre. Recently a Final Cut was issued on DVD. It restores some scenes that were taken out before to the film's detriment, but suffers also from a softening of one of the greatest lines in history. (When Roy Batty meets Dr. Tyrell, he confronts his maker with the line ""I want more life, f**ker."" This version (and others) softens the line to ""I want more life, father."" indicating the relationship between Roy and Tyrell. I liked it better the other way.)The story is fraught with allegory, laden with existentialism. If you try to take it too literally, you will be missing the point. It will be hard to digest the themes if you are not familiar with the writings of Descartes, Foucualt, Kierkegaard, or Nietzsche, which probably precludes the vast majority of viewers from fully appreciating the film.Blade Runner is based on the short story Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, written by the legendary Philip K. Dick, whose visionary plot-twisting epics include Total Recall (I Can Dream That For You Wholesale) and Minority Report, which was, sadly, defiled by being made into a Tom Cruise vehicle. Dick would have rolled over in his grave, since he loathed Hollywood for exactly such reasons.So why was this movie made? So a generation of lesser films would have a vast and bleak vision to imitate in countless rip-offs, take-offs, and send-ups. But none ever approach the stark and visionary brilliance of Blade Runner.Harrison Ford plays a Blade Runner, basically, an Android Hunter. A band of marauding androids, called Replicants, have violated Earth law by coming on-world. The year is 2019, and Earth is a post-apocalyptic nightmare cloaked in a perpetual drizzle and darkness. Ford is charged with hunting down the Replicants and destroying them.Now, there's too much to lay out here, but the Replicants have been preprogrammed by their makers to live only a short time. This prevents them from getting delusions of grandeur. Here is where you lose most casual observers. The Replicants represent Man, and his yearning for immortality is manifested in the angst these creatures feel at their impending doom. Why do we die? Why were we born in the first place? What is the meaning of our lives and our relationship with our creator?Now imagine that you had the chance to ask God these very things. This is exactly what happens when the lead Replicant, Roy, played by Rutger Hauer in his absolutely finest hour, meets Tyrell, the man who invented Replicants. Let's just say the meeting goes less than swimmingly, and the rage Roy feels afterward is the essence of the human struggle with the meaning and futility of life. In perfect human form, Roy literally dispenses with God and continues to search for meaning to his arbitrarily limited life.Harrison Ford famously disliked working in this film and with Ridley Scott, whose relentless demand for perfection frustrated Ford. Ford was apparently also dissatisfied with his character, whom he saw as weak. In fact, Deckert is, despite Ford's disdain for playing him, a subtle and nuanced character, fiercely conflicted, who shoots women in the back, drinks too much, and falls in love with his quarry, all the while stalking beings who only want what he wants, to live.The women in the movie are all breathtaking in their own way. Darryl Hannah is the exotic beauty, a Replicant designed, as her dossier explains, as a pleasure model. In a great example of attention to detail, her character, Pris, has an incept date of February 14, which is what one would expect for a pleasure model. Zora, played by Joanna Cassidy, is described as ""beauty and the beast"" since she is a trained killer. This duality is reflected in her dossier as well, since she is a Gemini, the perfect sign for duality. I could go on, but suffice it to say that there are endless such gems in the details.The film, with all its allusions, climaxes in the final confrontation between Deckert and Batty. It is confessional, elegiac and powerful. Batty faces his end clutching a white dove, a touch added by Rutger Hauer himself, in much the same way we consider our own souls as we face death, and if by now you haven't fully realized the ultimate allusion of the film, recall that Batty his a nail piercing his hand.The ultimate question to consider is whether Deckert himself is a Replicant, but you cannot fully weigh that question unless you watch the movie multiple times, and even then you will have to make a judgment call. It would not be characteristic of Dick to reveal any definitive answer to that question, so your answer will have to come from you as you consider your own ideas of life, existence, mortality and immortality, God, and destiny. Goodness. How could we ask more of a movie?Ridley Scott's direction melds in a miraculous synergy with Vangelis' superb, minimalist score. The result is a thought-provoking classic that raises, but doesn't quite answer, the most elemental questions of existence in a dreamland dystopia where humanity has been absorbed by its own disastrous creations.If you've never seen this movie, watch the original theatrical release with the extended footage. The commentary makes the story easier to follow, and since Dick will mess your mind like a master, most first time viewers need the commentary. (Indeed, it was added post-production, because Scott feared most viewers wouldn't understand the plot. He was right.)If you're familiar with Blade Runner, then watch the Director's Cut, or the newer Final Cut. The Sam Spade commentary is gone, and what is left is a desolate but magnificent voyage into the very best that Sci-Fi has to offer.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The Greatest Sci-Fi Film Ever Made,"Where can I even start? Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"" is as close to science fiction perfection as you can get. The cinematography is absolutely amazing even close to 30 years since it's been released. Rutger Hauer gives a performance for the ages. The movie has a futuristic setting that is grim and gritty, yet breathtaking to look at. It's message of life being so precious is sublime.The film centers around Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), a Blade Runner, who is given the task of killing or ""retiring"" four android soldiers known as Replicants. Their crime, punishable by death? Wanting to be human. Rutger Hauer gives the performance of a life time as Roy Batty, the leader of the foursome of androids Deckard is assigned to retire. Cold, sinister, evil...and all that is good in the human spirit. Sounds crazy right? Well, you have to witness the performance yourself. Especially the ""tears in rain"" finale.During the movie and especially at the end, you get the feeling that these androids are more human than the humans themselves. Which is the motto of the corporation that manufactures these synthetic humans, ""More human than human"".The films settings and noir overtones combined with the constant rain fall set up a dread atmosphere. What's so amazing it that it's still marvelous to look at.Long story short, ""Blade Runner"" is a sci-fi fans wet dream and just an incredible film in general. The acting is great, the plot is compelling, the cinematography and visuals are stellar and have stood the test of time, the script is marvelous, and it challenges you to think.One of my all time favorites and easily deserves a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Impressionism in dystopic contours,"First of all, Blade Runner is not about a story, it's not about, characters, it's not about being concrete. It's about landscape, it's about city, as reflex of civilization. It's about correcting our present, knowing what happened in the past. And so, the future is used, so the sci-fi mood is brought. Paradoxal it may be, the future tense gives the viewer the necessary distance towards what he is supposed to ""see"". And what you see is in here fundamental, not because of the spectacular sets, not because the astonishing prediction of what city will be in years to come but because it only shows what's already in front of us. Practically every sci-fi film that tries to predict an entirely new city is based on what is ""futuristic"" in the time of its idealization, from visual power masterpieces like Metropolis, to franchised versions of a future world like Demolition Man. Ridley Scott proposes a city that exists already, today, now. We get to the future through present, our present and that links us to it where the future tense gave us distance. Everything is deliberately thrown in a dystopic, chaos like package, that shakes, not because it's dark and rainy, but because it's in a city that exists now, and in buildings older than a century now. Sebastian lives in a neoclassic building from probably end of XIXth century, the routs of everything clearly bad and distorted and perverse in this Scott's future are clearly anchored on our present. Obviously every sci-fi director is before anything else, an earth inhabitant, so his base is his reality as a earthier, but in here, he makes the effort to through that at the viewer.So, everything is classical, Sean Young, a replicant that doesn't know it, has a classical beauty, the characterization, the way she moves, the way she talks. She plays the piano. She has a memory. She is human, except for the fact she is a replicant, created by men and that's where man is elevated to the category of god in the exact measure that he creates with the same perfection as Him. The camera is Deckard, the camera is the observer and this observer works in the top of the buildings, works above humanity, works on the last floor of Tyrell's Olympus like industrial complex. What is made in here is a change in time scale notion in order to get us, as viewers, down to earth. If god is eternity, and men's life is a second in eternity; what we see here is Men's life becoming the possible eternity and the replicants' 4 years life just a small passage in reality. Whenever replicants are referred in Blade Runner it is in fact me who is being referred. Ultimately, this may be about falling to earth with the notion that time is precious, and 4 years can be a long time, if well used. ""all those moments will be lost in time like tears in rain"", says Rutger Hauer's character.This is about keeping memory for eternity, whatever that is.Men is reflected on his creation, his imperfections, but also his qualities, show up in what he creates. So, throughout the film, we come to change our view of the replicants, from menace to empathy, from desire to eliminate (as survival instinct) to desire to embrace and consequent emptiness for their disappearance. That's when replicants become men, that's when we know he's not talking about robots, but us. ""petty she won't live, but again, who will?"" this is bottom line, nothing lasts forever, creator or creation. Still, facing the inevitability of death doesn't stop Deckard from running for life, or replicants from trying to live.Another aspect is that there is no ""soundtrack"", there is no ""music"" in this one, only ""soundscapes"", as dystopic as the city, as dark as this future, as empty as no future. Those sounds are the story of that city, are the story of our past, as told in our present, where there is no memory, where memories are forgotten, or made up as, once more, a survival device. Memory is a pillow for emotions, says Tyrell, he is god, he knows emotions are needed in order to exist, but he also knows he can't perpetuate lies about it, he knows he will die.Ultimately this may be a film noir anchored sci-fi film which, if well explored, could become a genre in itself. Checking it, you will find practically every aspect of film noir in it. For every aspect I referred, i believe this to be the essential sci-fi film, fulfilling completely the role that sci-fi was always supposed to have, but hardly ever had. Between 1979 with Alien and 1982 with this one, Ridley Scott moved definitely forward in understanding what science fiction is, and how it should leak into film making. Every artist has his limits in innovation and creation, apparently Scott's limit was defined here. His post work never got to be as influential or good as these two films, but, what he gave was more than enough.No rating needed, what i said should be enough.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
One of Scott's Best,"When people ask me, ""What is film noir?"", I tell them to watch Blade Runner. Without a doubt, this film deserves mention as a member of an artistic genre, as a science fiction film, and as a great movie altogether. Ridley Scott, who I consider to be an almost stylistic continuation of Kubrick, truly outdoes himself in veering drastically from most of his films' styles. In Blade Runner, you smell the cigarette smoke, feel the humidity of steam in your face, and are both taken aback and also drawn into this gritty world of corruption and backwardness.Harrison Ford makes the cynical detective role look easy, and does what he does best. However, Rutger Hauer shines in this movie, as the victim of society and backwardness, and raises the ultimate truth of the film at its climax.In the end, Blade Runner's only fault is the soundtrack. I will not deny that Vangelis was instrumental in creating the sound of Modern Film score, but in trying to make a totally futuristic, synthetic score, the picture loses the depth that a traditional soundtrack delivers. And, in addition to that, Vangelis tries to incorporate typical instruments, such as the Saxophone, which doesn't quite blend well with his style.Overall, I love the film, and recommend it to most of my sci-fi friends.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
My brief review of the film,"A dark and pessimistic view of the future, the film has some excellent lighting, good special effects and a brilliant production design, as well as some things to say in terms of artificial intelligence. However, the film is overall rather a routine sci-fi action thriller under the visual marvels. The story is quite simplistic, with typical romance and the idea of getting rid of the baddies, and neither the characters nor the acting is too stunning. The music feels a tad inappropriate too, but generally it is a rather well made film. It has thrills, style and some intriguing questions - and such is enough to keep one watching, no matter what problems one may have with it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Dark movie with a wonderful message,"To me this is Ridley Scott's best movie and it contains also the best appearance of Harrison Ford in a movie. Ridley Scott has made a movie, that lives from several things. First there is Harrison Ford. Harrison Ford to me is one of the best actors of the last thirty years. Furthermore the story is great photographed by Joran Cronenweth. The other cast also plays at its best. I mean for instance Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Darryl Hannah, and Brion James.Also the story is great. Six so-called Replicants are coming from the Mars to Earth to to get information how long they can live. I like the dark setup of the movie, that is given by the continuity of rain and so its dark sky, and which underlines the Sci-Fi/End-Time properties of the plot. Also what I like is the mixture of people from all parts in the world that are living in this future world.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Blade Runner isn't Dick,"Having been recommended the (then) new film of Phillip K Dick's ""Do Androids dream of Electric Sheep,"" I saw and loved Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"" when it was new. When I finally read ""Androids"" about two years ago and discovered that Blade Runner is obviously a jumping off point, but it's really a different story. Part ""1984"" and part ""Children of Men,"" ""Androids"" is about a seriously dysfunctional, probably dieing society dominated by a pervasive propaganda effort.While it's not clear that the world of ""Blade Runner,"" is any less dysfunctional, the political elements seem very ordinary for a big city. Its focus is on the characters, which are very nearly human, as are we all. The focus is not on the times but on the experience of humanity that defines us and fails to draw a clear line between human and ""replicant."" Scott puts the question in the mouth of a replicant, to wonder whether our detective is himself human, at which point we may begin to remember what may be clues about this, but the question is never again raised. But they both seem to pass the tests we would make of their being human.Where Dick is caught up in his own cynicism, Ridley Scott seems to have given us an anthem, especially with his dark and decadent future LA, but just magnificent, the last great non-CGI set, along with a dense and powerful Vangelis soundtrack.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A masterpiece,"Blade Runner is a movie that will be remembered as a classic of its genre and even one of the greatest films of all time.The production design and style are simply phenomenal. It's hard not to see this film's influence on subsequent entries into the sci fi genre and just on films in general. This is such an imaginative, dark, atmospheric and detailed vision of the future, you're pulled in just by the way the movie looks and sounds. The streets are damp, dark, cold and overcrowded The buildings are run down and decaying, but the skys are filled with flying billboards and hover cars. It's a throwback to the old film noir genre in many ways, but fresh and creative at the same time.The film operates on a number of different philosophical levels as well. This warrants many repeated viewings, if only to better understand how much there is here to be thought about. The film raises a number of questions about what it really means to be human, and leaves a lot open ended for the viewer to ponder.This is a must for sci fi fans, but also just for anyone interested in incredible movie making.

Androids are not some artificial beings, but strong metaphor of the last remains of humanity that left in the people.It is a story of dehumanization final step when all will be forgotten like ""tears in the rain"". The final scene with Ruther Hauer is one of the best i have ever seen on film and it is the very essence of this master-piece.

Bladerunner,"I love the things that you don't notice specifically on the first viewing. These things contribute to the overall atmosphere of the film, but I really noticed them after I had first seen the film. For example, Deckard's sardonic voice-over; Sebastian's loneliness and guilt which causes him to let Pris into his home although he is suspicious of her; Rachael's 40's dress and hairstyle; the inhumane testing of the 'droids; the photos that are so important to all the characters (Deckard has his, too); the casual cruelty of these creators of the androids. The wonderful humanity of Roy in the end.Also, what about the light reflected in the androids eyes? Deckard's eyes reflect light in the same way. Has he been created to kill androids? Ridley Scott thought so.Now other movie looked like this in 1982. Everything since has been derivative of this watershed film. Those wonderful shots of a dystopic LA in the future were jaw-dropping when I saw it in the theater in 1982. Ridley Scott used a Frank Lloyd Wright house as Deckard's apartment; this is a totally unique environment with it's walls of Mayan stellae and low ceilings. Sebastian's apartment is in the famous Bradbury (named after Ray Bradbury) building in LA.This is a wonderful movie!",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The future is here,"Not necessarily being a sci-fi geek yet not necessarily disliking the genre sometimes has its advantages. To be quite honest I am still not able to determine what makes me like one science- fiction movie and hate the other but with Blade Runner I can finally put into words why I was very impressed.It's amazing to watch a movie from the 80s and be so pleasantly surprised by the quality of the decor and special effects, it looks better than some movies from the 2000s! So Blade Runner takes place in 2020 which is now just 3 years away, but I can imagine at that time it must have felt like the very distant, scary future that was yet to come. We see a very cold looking and industrialized Los Angeles where it always seems to be misty and dark. What's left of the towns population has moved into huge skyscrapers. We get introduced to the ""replicants"" which are just basically extremely real looking, perfect versions of humans who are able to develop both feelings and a consciousness which is ironically the reason they are doomed to only have a 4-year lifespan.It's so interesting and frightening at the same time to imagine that we could make artificial life, only for it to develop into something stronger and more capable than ourselves and ending up with catastrophic consequences. Also the idea that these replicants value life much more than actual humans holds a very important message. Would we, if ever confronted with the problem of robots taking over, even deserve to outlive them? The philosophy behind the movie is something that especially in this day in age is a frequently discussed topic. Where on the one hand we feel excited that technology is making spectacular progress in increasingly shorter periods of time we on the other hand feel very frightened we may not be able to keep up with our creations. I love how to writers leave this topic abstract to a certain degree, which allows the viewer to interpret it in its own way without undermining the quality of the story.It's very interesting how Blade Runner presented the future in a way that now turns out to be both way off and realistic at the same time, before watching the new installment I would highly recommend checking this classic out first and forming your own opinion on it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A science fiction masterpiece,"Blade Runner is recognized as a sci-fi classic. It addresses one of the great philosophic questions of our time: What does it mean to be human? Blade Runner has inspired numerous other films, some of them great in their own right. Among those are Terminator, AI (admittedly not everyone's cup of tea) and the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica which coincidently stars James Edward Olmos. It has contributed mightily to Phillip K Dick's status as author and cult hero. The film's impact is not diminished by the fact that the idea of machines turning on their makers has become a cliché. Blade Runner sets the standard for what a cinematic realization of the future as a dystopia should look like. This movie is a Ridley Scott masterpiece. If you like your sci fi to be thought provoking, you will love Blade Runner. If you haven't seen Blade Runner before, rent the director's cut version.

Replicants,"Ridley Scott directed this adaptation of the Philip K. Dick story that stars Harrison Ford as Rick Deckard, a retired replicant(enhanced human clones used on colony worlds with limited lifespans but unstable personalities) hunter called back into service to locate and destroy a group of replicants that have returned to Earth to kill their creator. The worst of them is Roy Batty(played by Rutger Hauer) who becomes Deckard's chief opponent. Though visually striking and quite imaginative, what is sorely lacking is a compelling story with relatable characters, since this film is otherwise cold and uninvolving. Still, the acting is fine, and it has become a huge cult favorite, but though I have repeatedly tried, I just can't get into it.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A masterpiece of the science fiction,"An outstanding Sci-fi philosophic and poetic movie embedded in a cop action story, loosely based in the novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" by Philip Dick.Blade Runner is a film about the possibilities of our near future, about the meaning of being free and of being human, about the relation between natural world and created world, about the redeeming power of loving whomever you want, despite any social constriction, among others themes. These themes, and the depth in which they are presented, are the element that place this movie over most sci-fi movies. If you miss them, you are missing the whole point of the movie.Blade Runner is also a visionary movie, as many of the gadgets and technical inventions shown there are a reality nowadays or are being developed (video-calls, Photoshop manipulation, biological production of organs, high developed robotics, etc.). The movie also envisions many traits of our 21st century world and society: fusion cuisine, increasing interracial mixing, a globalised technologically-dominated society, the pollution and unsustainability of our cities, among few others.The acting is superb and believable by all actors, especially by Rutger Hauer (brilliant), Daryl Hannah (in her best role ever), Harrison Ford (ditto) and Sean Young (in one of her best roles).It is one of those movies that everybody should see, as is one of the best sci-fi movies ever, one of the best movies ever, whose message and themes are still as fresh as they were in the 1980s.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
One of the Greatest Sci-Fi films of all time...,"Welcome to the future and the future is not bright. Blade Runner, directed by Ridley Scott, focuses on a stylized, retro-future Los Angeles where everything is not well. This film presents a dramatic landscape of the future with no certain explication on how we got to this point. All that is explained is that human replicants have been born from immense breakthroughs in technology, and that other than their increased strength and intelligence, are indistinguishable from their human counterparts. Rick Deckard, played by Harrison Ford, is a retired member of an elite squad known as Blade Runners, whose purpose is to hunt down rogue replicants and destroy them. And such is the scenario that Scott presents us with as he takes us on a journey to the very core of meaning and existence.The film's breathtaking imagery and its incredible sound bolster this raw journey as Deckard reluctantly hunts down a group of replicants. We are placed in the context of this world, less knowledgeable than the fictional characters, and we are not pushed to believe that one side is more righteous or more deserving of life. Deckard's pursuit of the wanted replicants takes us through a character study or character studies of not just Deckard but the replicants too, mainly the leader, Roy Batty played by Rutger Hauer. The performances are outstanding by a great cast, additionally including the likes of Sean Young, Daryl Hannah and Edward Olmos. Through the blend of these great performances, we see these characters for what they are and how they truly exist, be they human or replicant. There are a few twists along the way that I do not want to spoil but the film slowly builds to a haunting and powerful climax.And that is an important part of the experience of viewing Blade Runner: that it is slow. By no means is this an action-packed film like a, shall we say, Terminator: Judgment Day. But this film is so strong and smart in what it presents that the pace of the film is not only unnoticeable but incredibly artistic. And it separates itself from the rest of the sci-fi pack with its phenomenal aesthetic artistry. The retro-future noir style of Los Angeles is captured beautifully and lends greater credibility to the plot and the characters. Through the dark and noir setting, we are given a bleak glimpse into the future, that seems rather plausible and palpable even in our present day.Let me be honest as I conclude here. When I first saw this film, I didn't really enjoy it. I didn't appreciate it that much and I was left rather disappointed. However, upon my repeated viewings, this film continued to grow on me and presented me with new challenges and questions each time. And that is part of the magic of the enigmatic Blade Runner. It can show us something different every time without us truly understanding it every time. With that said, it has now become one of my favorite films of all time. The film is unquestionably Ridley Scott's masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
I'd put it on the walls of Louvre,"How to describe beauty without expressing true feelings? It's a deeply personal film that touches depths of a human soul and represents true beauty in so many aspects: the everlasting and unbearable beauty of real love, the beauty of our dystopian humanity that never loses hope, the beauty of our creative minds and our capability to cherish our memories. Even the beauty of our selfdestructive nature that we cannot comprehand. When I watched Blade Runner for the first time it was in the early 80's theater and I was overwhelmed as some visitor of Louvre whose tears roll down his cheeks because he cannot handle too much beauty, too much truth about ourselves and our world.

Scotts Finest Hour... (or two)...,"Director: Ridley Scott. Running time: 117 mins (approx). Certification (UK): 15.Genre: Sci-Fi/Drama/Thriller. UK Release date: 9th September 1982. NOTE: This DVD version hails from 1991.Watched on DVD Thursday 17th November 2011.PLEASE NOTE: THERE MAY BE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW.I have spoken to many fans of Science Fiction over the years and the vast majority of them always have something good to say about this film. Now I know there are those among you, mostly deranged people, who might hold a different view, but I am on the side of those who rate this film. I'll even go so far as to say its right up there with the very best sci-fi films (if you ignore the original theatrical cut, which was truly awful). More of my praise after this brief summary.There is an opening scrolling text on this version of the film that explains the set-up better than I ever could, here it is:""Early in the 21st Century, THE TYRELL CORPORATION advanced Robot evolution into the NEXUS phase - a being virtually identical to a human - known as a Replicant.The NEXUS 6 Replicants were superior in strength and agility, and at least equal in intelligence, to the genetic engineers who created them.Replicants were used Off-World as slave labour, in the hazardous exploration and colonization of other planets.After a bloody mutiny by a NEXUS 6 combat team in an Off-World colony, Replicants were declared illegal on earth - under penalty of death.Special police squads - BLADE RUNNER UNITS - had orders to shoot to kill, upon detection, any trespassing Replicant.This was not called execution. It was called retirement.""Now you've read that I shall continue Four Replicants have jumped ship, killed the crew and the passengers and made it to Earth. They are; Roy Batty, Pris, Leon Kowalski and Zhora. A retired Blade Runner, Rick Deckard, is brought in to hunt down and 'retire' these Replicants. He is first sent to the Tyrell Corporation where he meets Rachael, a Nexus 6 Replicant. At the time she is unaware of the fact, but Dr. Eldon Tyrell assures Deckard that she's 'special'. Leon had murdered another Blade Runner, Holden, and Deckard goes to Leon's apartment where he finds a clue. Little does he know, the replicants are also trying to find someone Someone high up. I'll leave it there or the Spoiler Police will be calling me in for a Voight-Kampff test (again).Visually stunning with a beautiful and atmospheric score by Vangelis, this film has a lot going for it (IMO). Great performances all round; Harrison Ford plays the world-weary Deckard to a tee, Rutger Hauer is excellent as the brutal but fragile Roy Batty and Sean Young plays Rachael with just the right amount of fear. Also worthy of note are; Edward James Olmos as Gaff, M. Emmet Walsh as Bryant, Daryl Hannah as Pris, William Sanderson as J.F. Sebastian, Brion James as Leon, Joe Turkel as Dr. Eldon Tyrell and Joanna Cassidy as Zhora.I have seen this film many times before but this is the first time I realised just how introspective it is. All the action is focused on Deckard and the Replicants without the audience really seeing much outside this group. Yes there are hints; the advertising for the off-world colonies, but apart from that it's very insular. Moving on, I thought the effects were truly stunning, given that there was no CGI back then and the design, the look and the feel of the whole thing is superb. A world is created that the audience could easily imagine Los Angeles 2019 to be like OK, maybe not the flying cop cars, but you know what I mean. Yes, it does tend to drag on a bit towards the end, but I can forgive that for a truly excellent film that, for its day, has never been equalled VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.My Score: 9.5/10.IMDb Score: 8.3/10 (based on 223,454 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 92/100 (based on 101 reviews counted at the time of going to press).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A stunning work of sci-fi beauty,"Despite being one of the most highly problematic masterpieces of the American cinema, Blade Runner boasts an influence few films have exerted. It may be self-(over) indulgent – but who can blame you when you 're so damn gorgeous looking? – it may be so absorbed with its majestic outer environment that it sometimes forgets the inner substance of its people but, incredibly, it is precisely this artificiality of it that generates emotional responses you'd never expect. 28 years and no less than five editions later (!), Blade Runner is a cinematically stunning biblical narrative about Man's desire to confront his Maker – and, maybe, gouge his eyes out Paced like a 70's movie really, yet dressed up in its sci-fi nines (enter '80s), it demands your attention simply by addressing directly such trivialities as mortality, identity and, to this writer, a love story for the ages.

Fiery The Angels Fell,"Blade Runner is a masterpiece, both in terms of visual realization and screenplay. The direction is superb, the lighting atmospheric, many performances sublime. Rutger Hauer as lethal replicant Roy, and delicious Sean Young, as the vulnerable Rachael are particularly memorable.Neither should we overlook a highly original score, delivered by musical genius Vangelis. His association with Jon Anderson, on the album ""Short Stories"", took synthesized orchestration in new directions during the 1980s. As for Bladerunner, we receive a unique soundtrack few other sci-fi films can equal.For those with a taste for science fiction, Blade Runner is a nod to those richly drawn, intellectual films that audiences were lucky enough to experience in the late 60s and 70s. (I'm thinking of such incredible cinema as Silent Running, 2001 A Space Odyssey and Barbarella). Alas, Hollywood has opted for more predictable and violent fodder in recent years, leading me to suspect films of Blade Runner's quality will remain rare.Blade Runner's beauty lies in a commitment to present the audience with a panoramic future, yet still rooted in a world dominated by the fragility of human experience. The characters that inhabit this world are flawed, tragic and meaningful. There's no two-dimensional superheroes here. We're presented with the realities of cruel commerce and technocratic supremacy. However, the technocrats receive their comeuppance. In this way, Blade Runner is also a moral parable, though never preaches.The replicants seek ""more life"", although it's Rachael and Deckard that illicit our sympathy. Rachael is deceived by the Corporation, while Deckard is a reluctant ""fixer"", charged with ""retiring"" that same organization's mistakes. This is very clever writing. Hampton Fancher's screenplay interweaves plotting and sub-plot with ingenious skill. Such literary craftsmanship is rarely translated so successfully to film.The script itself is one of the best I can remember in a sci-fi film, including wonderful quotes from such luminaries as William Blake. (I can't remember the last occasion an English Poet was quoted in a Hollywood Movie, though such references add unforgettable texture to an already deeply symbolic piece).With this in mind, I'll leave you with Roy's moving epilogue: ""I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time... like tears in rain. Time to die.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Could of been more.... but still good,"Blade Runner is directed by Ridley Scott. No doubt, Scott is a visionary director. That is certainly on display in this film. Scott builds a world that is stunning and immersive. The film boasts great effects and is truly a visual masterpiece that is complimented by Vangelis' excellent soundtrack.This film is ambitious and certainly is ahead of its time. While the film has ambitions, some of the scenes fall flat due to inconsistent acting and undeveloped concepts. Some of the acting is great in this film. Harrison Ford as Deckard and Rutger Hauer as Roy give great performances. While both of these actors give us these great performances, it's the actors that play the Replicants who make good scenes feel dry and certainly don't do Ford and Hauer's characters justice. While there are heart-pumping moments in this movie, some of the scenes are just flat-out boring and feel like they're missing something that would make for an intriguing scene. Despite the negatives, the plot advances smoothly and makes for a memorable story.This movie is definitely a classic though, but because of the visuals and effects, rather than the content of the film.

Essay about Blade Runner,"The scenario for this story is a town, in the future, with more then one hundred million inhabitants, with an atmosphere so polluted that the sun barely shows up and it is taken by a constant acid rain; Los Angeles. At this time, for colonization and exploration of other planets were developed Replicants, genetically engineered humanoids, stronger and faster than a human being and with comparable intelligence. But they were emotionally unstable, had little empathy,aggressive behavior and their life was limited to four years. After a rebellion in a colony outside of earth they were outlawed on earth, under penalty of death. In spite of this a group of six rebel replicants came to earth in search of their creator, and with him try to increase their shelf-life and escape from death that was approaching. They were hunted by police known as ""Blade Runner"", with orders to kill, or rather ""remove"". The persecution of the replicants becomes a harrowing fight for life where no one knew who as hunting or who was hunted, especially after blade-runner meets the latest model of replicant, ""Rachel"", which received the complete memories of ""Tyrell""'s niece, the father of all androids. As they hunted and killed one by one, we perceive ourselves more human characteristics in replicants than in hunters. In the penultimate scene, the hunter's life is in the hands of the last replicant, that even knowing being in his final moments, saves the hunter using only one of his hands. It was raining at the moment when the last replicant looking the terrified hunter, says:""-I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. -All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in the rain. -Time to die""then he lowers his head and dies without any furthers movement, under the hunter's stunned gaze.Our moments will be lost in time, like tears in the rain, it makes us think about the preservation of life and our eternal desire to live forever. It address us to some questions that humans have asked for centuries: What does it mean to be human? what is reality? How does our environment affect us? What are the moral issues we face in the creation of artificial people?These and many more questions are there in this film for those who wish to examine them.

A definitive work of art in the genre of Science Fiction !!!,"This review is for the 'Final Cut' version of 'Blade Runner'.Science Fiction can never be just about cool gadgets, big spaceships, flying cars, laser swords, weird creatures, etc. Science Fiction works the best when it deals with profound issues and themes that are relevant in the current world and society. Science Fiction should be about analysing theories and philosophies, maybe in a futuristic or other-worldly environment, and in my opinion, 'Blade Runner' is second to none in epitomising every aspect of deep Science Fiction that I have mentioned.The film is loosely based on a novel written by Philip K. Dick named 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?'. The screenplay was written by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples, of course in collaboration with the master filmmaker Ridley Scott who directed this film. It is set in the Los Angeles of 2019. This dystopian,futuristic L.A. is almost disturbingly dark, bleak, overpopulated and there is distinct contrast between the world of the haves and the world of the have- nots. The rich upper class reside in giant skyscrapers, while the lower to the lower-middle class live in dirty living conditions in the rumbling, overpopulated streets. We are told that Replicants were robots created by human beings. The Nexus 6 model of Replicants look like humans and are stronger and equally intelligent as the scientists who created them. But the only thing that they are supposed to look is emotion and empathy for others. These Replicants were used for slave labor, mainly to acquire Off-world territories for expansion. But the Replicants revolted and the they were subsequently deemed illegal and officers by the name of Blade Runners were employed to not execute, but 'retire' them.'Blade Runner' is one of the most thematically deep films I have ever seen. There are a whole array of ideas that are explored in the film. I think the primary theme running through the film is the quest for your own identity. Most of us are assigned this identity by society and we are supposed to look, act and talk in a manner which will be deemed appropriate for our identity. But in reality we spend our entire lives searching for our true identity as a person to give our lives a meaning. In a very similar way, in the world of Blade Runner, Replicants who were created by humans are rejected and deemed illegal when they revolt and demand human treatment instead of slave treatment as in the eyes of society, they are not humans. So, there is also clearly an element of equality or the lack of it which is explored in the script along with the existence of discrimination based on someone's identity in the society as a whole. The film deals with existential issues about what it means to be human. The Replicants are supposed to be devoid of emotions, which is the one thing that sets them apart from human beings, but ironically we see human beings show very little empathy during the film while the Replicants display genuine love and care for each other. The film can also be seen from a standpoint of religion. The relationship between the Replicants and their human creators can be seen as an allegory for the relationship between Man and God. Some people have certain expectations from God, the creator and when these expectations don't get met, they gradually stray away from God and abandon him/her. Death plays a huge part to underline the allegorical element.The production design is absolutely fantastic. Ridley Scott along with his collaborators gives us a living, breathing, bustling version of Scott's almost noir-ish vision of futuristic world. The attention to detail is so convincing that the viewer will feel like a part of the world depicted in the film. Ridley Scott's direction makes the world and the characters completely believable and his style always prevents 'Blade Runner' from becoming a commercial action film. The relationship between Deckard the Blade Runner played by Harrison Ford and the city reminded me of Travis Bickle's relationship with the city of New York. The New York in 'Taxi Driver' and the futuristic L.A. in 'Blade Runner' are both dark, dirty and dangerous, but still, they have a strange seductive beauty about them. Deckard, like Bickle wanders around the streets (as a Blade Runner trying to catch Replicants) and then wallows in his solitude and loneliness in the confines of his home. This is one of Harrison Ford's best performances. I think so because Deckard is a far more complex character than the characters which are more famous like Han Solo or Indiana Jones. This is because Deckard is not a stereotypical handsome, bad-ass who cracks witty one-liners and exudes machismo. This man is someone who is struggling with his identity and his loneliness and in a way the whole film revolves around this character's arc. The story moves ahead with Deckard's self realisations and changes in his opinions and Ford comes up with an understated and nuanced performance. Rutger Hauer's performance as the Replicant Roy Batty is just amazing. Instead of being a standard villain, the brilliant writing allows Roy to be more than a villain, as his motivations and opinions are very understandable and relateable. Hauer's perfect gestures and line delivery makes his character layered and worthy of empathy. Sean Young as Rachael also is great. Her performance is controlled and she beautifully adjusts her acting with the gradual psychological changes that her character undergoes.'Blade Runner' is an existential masterpiece set in a dystopian future which never backs away from tackling very profound themes and issues. The characters are all real and the world instead of being comic bookish, is very symbolic and allegorical. Blade Runner is also one of the most influential films ever and it is deemed to be one of the few works of art which pioneered the birth of the genre of Cyberpunk.

Sci-Fi  Masterpiece,"I must confess the first time I watched this film I didn't really care for it,in fact you could say I thought it was downright boring. Aside from the outstanding effects I felt the plot lacked any punch. However I gave it a second look and it grew on me. The third time I was hooked. I now believe it is one of the top two or three science fiction movies ever made.What I love about this film is that it poses a lot of questions that many of us have as humans. However it doesn't give any real answers just like real life doesn't provide many answers. The cast is universally solid. Harrison Ford to me has always been a fine but inconsistent actor. I don't think he has ever had a role as good as Decker before or since. However it's Rugter Haeur who really stole the show. He delivers some of the best lines in the film. One line in the film in particular struck me.The direction of Ridley Scott is nothing sort of superb. He creates a perfect blend of flashy effects and a dreary, hopeless atmosphere. The culture is filled with nostilga, technology, and junk.I strongly recommend this film for someone looking for a movie that mixes effects with a lot of substance.If your looking for a bang-bang shoot'em up sci-fi film like Star Wars or Aleins look else where.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"Several different versions, but my favorite one is the one I saw back in 1982","(1982) Blade Runner
SCIENCE- FICTION THRIILERThe first film adaption from a story written by Science- Fiction writer Philip K. Dick- the others also include ""Payback"", ""Minority Report"", and ""Total Recall"" to name a few . If someone were to ask me what was one of the most influential movies in history, it would also have to add this one to the list which is the stepping stone for many futuristic films of Neo-Tokyo such as ""Akira"" and ""Ghost of the Shell"" to name a few and perhaps many other film makers such as John Woo because of his frequent uses of using doves. The story is like watching a science fiction 'film noir' in which the overall story-line takes place mostly in the dark with not much action sequences. The story which revolves around uncontrollable androids or in this film replicants which look like humans that are creating an environment too dangerous to live in because of their unpredictable behavior sets up the objective about why people like Rick played by Harrison Ford were hired to exterminate them. He also happens to fall in love with one of them which was supposed to create some conflict but really it doesn't. Although the 'ultimate DVD' offers viewers up to 5 different endings, they're really only two existing endings theatrically screened for audiences- the directors cut and the original 1982 version which the two endings are completely different. In all fairness, I never saw the Ridley Scott's directors cut because I did not like the way he cut the original ending right out therefore I can't give it a proper rating. But between the two versions I still prefer the 1982 version because it does show some solidarity since throughout the entire film consisted to have many dark environments and it wasn't until the end that it finally showed that everywhere was not like that. It has also been said that this was Harrison Ford's least favorite film to work on probably because it was perhaps his most hardest one to do which demands realistic grueling and grim locations. 4/4 only for the 1982 version.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"The ""Casablanca"" of Science Fiction Films: Maybe the Deepest of SF Cinema that Birthed the Cyber SF Era","When ""Blade Runner"" was released in the Summer of 1982, mainstream audiences were not quite ready for this very different vision of the future. And I will even admit, I was among them at the time. I didn't understand the depth of ""Blade Runner"" until I had had subsequent multiple experiences of it. I don't know if you really see Blade Runner as much as become absorbed into it. Although Blade Runner was a box office disappointment upon its release, it had stiff competition in 1982. Spielberg's ""ET"", the sentimental science fiction film, had broken all box office records; Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, was the favorite for pure good guy versus bad guy SF; and other films outside the genre were much more uplifting and linear, such as ""Tootsie"" and ""An Officer and a Gentleman"". (The other under-appreciated masterpiece of that year was ""Sophie's Choice"", although Meryl Streep did deservedly win for Best Actress.)Despite its mixed critical reception, including a very ambivalent review by Roger Ebert who called it a ""failure as a story"", ""Blade Runner"" has emerged as one the three best films of 1982, the other two being ""Ghandhi"" and ""Sophie's Choice"". My revised list of Best Picture nominees in alphabetical order for 1982: ""Blade Runner"", ""E.T."" ""Ghandhi"", ""Missing"", ""Sophie's Choice"". I would still give top award nods to Ghandhi but only by the slimmest of margins. Blade Runner would be my very close second choice. (""The Verdict"" and ""Tootsie"" are good films but not exactly masterpieces.)The story concerns relatively new technology: the producing of humanoid cyborgs which have become dangerously close to human life. They are called ""Replicants"". The latest models appear to have feelings and emotions like humans. Now, some renegade Replicants who feel they were treated as slaves on a labor planet have sprung from their ""slavery"" and returned to earth. They wish to confront their creators. Richard ""Rick"" Deckard (Harrison Ford) is a ""blade runner"", a kind of detective/police officer who finds and exterminates renegade Replicants. One of his tools is a series of questions offered a suspected Replicant designed to create responses which tip-off the questioner as to whether or not the participant is human. But then Decker falls for a female Replicant, Rachel (Sean Young) who seems all too human.In the 1950's and 1960's, a very select group of eclectic readers absorbed and appreciated the work of a somewhat lesser-known science fiction writer, Philip K. Dick. Dick was a maverick of the SF genre, essentially immersing readers into a world much more reminiscent of the works of Raymond Chandler and Dashiel Hammett than Gene Roddenbery or George Lucas. Philip Marlowe and Sam Spade could navigate Blade Runner's darkened and misty streets much more effectively than either James T. Kirk or Luke Skywalker. While the most popular writers of the SF genre were still getting into rocket ships and flying to planets for high adventure, Dick was painting on an entirely new canvas, where urban noir meets future technology. Flying taxis and large plasma screens reside along with overpopulation and dirty streets. And he was writing in the 1950's and 1960's! However, even by 1982, audiences were still craving the likes of heroic science fiction such as Star Trek and Star Wars. Typical audience sensibility was still far behind ""Blade Runner"".What made ""Blade Runner"" tough on audiences at the time of its release and so appreciated today is that it challenges viewers' perceptions of not only the future but the nature of modern reality itself. Unlike Star Wars and Star Trek, ""Blade Runner"" is a cautionary tale, an updated version of ""Frankenstein: The Modern Prometheus"" and therefore, everything presented in its world is at the very least disconcerting and at the worst quite horrifying. SF has been predominantly about Utopias. ""Blade Runner"" is a story set in a ""Dystopia"". SF most often distinguishes between right and wrong, good and bad. ""Blade Runner"" is about the blurry shades between ethics and justice, where the ones with which we most empathize are outlaws. SF endings are often neat and tidy. ""Blade Runner"" offers a very ambiguous and contemplative ending (and I am not referring to the final coda of the original theatrical release). ""Blade Runner"" deals with themes concerning the larger questions of life and meaning, very uncommon in SF cinema as a whole. And that's why ""Blade Runner"" has become not only an iconic classic of the SF genre, it is one of the reasons that cinema has continued to be a captivating medium. ""Blade Runner"" is in the same company as ""Ghandhi"", ""Citizen Kane"", and ""Casablanca"". Know that SF can sometimes transcend its own genre, and BR inspired a new wave of films, such as ""The Matrix"" and ""Dark City"". ""Blade Runner"" was and is one of the finest examples of watershed ground-breaking cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A message for the future,"An film that released in 1982, and still is, and always will be, relevant. Blade Runner is timeless, it can be almost counted as a warning for the technological opportunities of humanity. If we, as a species, create beings that should, work like us to serve the growth of industrial society, why are we angry when those beings start to think and act like us? Whose fault is it?Blade Runner deals with that question. And it deals with it masterfully. Every single one of those 4 Replicants wasn't necessarily a bad person. They're not typical antagonists. They are just people, who want to live more. And they have the right to be upset, why should the products we make be failures, If this would happen in real life, we would be the failures, because we lost all of our sense of moral and empathy and gave and took the life of a sort of new species.The arrogance of humanity has made Los Angeles how is it portrayed in this film to what it is, it's all about capitalism, and even if we aren't where Blade Runner thought we where in 2019, we get closer to that vision within every year that passes. I'll give the climate fifteen years until it reaches a point where rain is a daily-thing.It's interesting and kinda sad how a man can love a woman, that is not even a real human-being. Rachel has the shape and she physically feels like a woman, she conveys emotions out of her, but she simply isn't, everything she remembers is from a different real human being. I think the question if it is justified for a man like Deckard to Kiss and Love an replicant, really interesting.The only thing that mostly matters to human beings, is being real. Living in the real world or being a real person is important to us, that is what gives us faith in religion and spirituality, and if that Idea of realism gets torn apart, and everything you believed is real for your whole life is suddenly fake, just some wires, electricity and implants, you can't cope with that surrealism. Rachel embodies that surrealism, her reaction when Deckard tells her that he knows her memories more detailed than she knows, her whole view of life is uncertain. Sean Young portrays the emotions of Rachel even just with a subtly tear or look profoundly.But Rutger Hauer as Roy Batty.. he made himself immortal with this role. Forget about everything that I mentioned, even If the plot and Ideas of the film would be just half as good, that final monologue from Rutger Hauer changed my life. Even the worst replicant still has the ability to show empathy, and see life as a gift in his last moments, no matter how horrible or terrifying it was. It is special, how much life means to a single individual. After a moment passes it is just lost in time, forever.I love Blade Runner. I love the atmosphere, the Idea of a over-industrialized capitalistic world, Vangelis soundtrack, the consequences of empathetic replicants with feelings, but most importantly, that it teaches, that life is a gift.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Essential Viewing for a Human Being,"It is not often a film warrants 10/10. Bladerunner, spearheaded by Harrison Ford (Rick Deckard) and Rutger Hauer (Roy Batty), delivers both cinematically, with its designer sets and innovative clothing, to its script and acting quality. Based on Philip K. Dick's book, ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"", Bladerunner has surpassed beyond what an ideal film is. Often times, for instance, there is double meanings in scenes, that run as deep as the cosmos.For its visuals alone, it has ingrained itself in history when sci-fi was coming into CGI. CGI, unfortunately, pales hopelessly, even today, in comparison to yesterday's Hollywood models. From the cars to the streets to the VidPhon, the future is so well depicted that nothing has challenged it before neither after. Demolition Man with Sylvestor Stallone was formidable, but it fails in so many other respects that it should not even be considered as a challenge.Entering Bladerunner, it explores what it means to be a human, and, how important emotions are in shaping who we are. It also exploits other, complex philosophical issues, as Deckard tries to understand ""what"" he is and whether anything is, in fact, ""real."" Sounds like the Matrix, except the correct clause would be: The Matrix sounds like Bladerunner, with the addition of the Matrix being a gross misinterpretation. While the Matrix provides us with a possibility of what reality is, Bladerunner is less ambitious, focusing on and questioning what memories are, how they shape us, and what our ""reality"" means in relation.It questions our morals; our history; our identities; our entire logically constructed world. As we have a myriad of qualities in common with the Replicants, they only live for 4 years. It teaches us about the importance of understanding, or, at least attempting to understand, life's nature and what that means to ones personal subsistence. With only 4 years to live a life span, the Replicants show us that they have the ability to get wise quickly, rather than the situation with humans: growing old so fast but wise so slow.Philosophically, this film is significantly accurate. The scene where Batty meets his maker, Tyrell, is compelling and is one of the best scenes in film history. Each scene is a journey, and, together, it completes a fine story - blessed with deep irony and valuable information about how we arrived at our present intellectual states. There is much action, too.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
One of the best looking films of the 80's from Ridley Scott,"One thing can't be denied about the sci-fi epic Blade Runner: it's look of the future, while possibly not totally original, is original in tone and has things to look for in nearly every scene.  At it's worst, Scott's picture is eye-candy, but tasty bits of candy I add.Ford plays the title character here, as an ex blade runner who is recruited back to track down the androids who are becoming human.  Then the plot unfolds with him changing, and things around him as well.

Maybe it was more interesting 30 years ago,"Let me first say that I indeed have understood the movie and the message of it. I understand the questioning of humanity and our nature.When I first read about this movie I thought and still am thinking , that the idea of the movie is quite unique and interesting. However ,
I was expecting kind of a detective hunt for replicans but instead got an incredibly slow , boring , dramatic , lifeless , bland looking movie.Harrison Ford had like 20 lines so don't expect to care even a slight about this guy. I honestly couldn't care for a second if he dies . I dont need a movie to be an action movie but It just didn't do anything to glue me to the screen.One Replican women fights Harrison Ford for 3 seconds , decides to make 4 flips and dies. What kind of replican was she ? Ballerina or something !?I guess we were supposed to be in some way invested in a love relationship that our main character has. Except that is shown for 2 minutes . The freaking Coca Cola bilboard has more run time in this movie than that.The only thing that made this movie watchable was the ending. It had deeper message that makes you think about us humans in general.I just don't see how anyone can say this movie is thrilling. Maybe if you have seen 2 movies in your lifetime , you might say that because i can name comedy movies that were more thrilling than this one.I wish I could say more positive things.

About mortality,"This film is basically about mortality and the ensuing rage of the creature against their creator. The basic premise of the NEXUS-6 is that they are so perfect they are not allowed to last... because as they develop independent thoughts and, yes, feelings, they are a threat; consequently, they should be eliminated. A social analyst could write hours about this. But the film could be summed up in Roy Batty's final words: ""I have seen things you people wouldn't believe [...] those moments will be lost in time like tears in rain..."" Living four years as the NEXUS-6 or eighty as a healthy human being doesn't change things: the fact is that we all are we going to die, and everything's lost then unless we find a way to pass it on. Replicants cannot reproduce by themselves; art remains, and having read the original novel I recall a replicant there called Luba Luft, who was specially obsessed by art. And this movie is a work of art. Rutger Hauer could have been an early Gary Oldman, why he didn't find the success he deserved, I don't know. He was great as the demented, enraged, desperate but genial Roy Batty. Sean Young as Rachael is great too, with very subtle moments of quiet grief that are a real treasure. Daryl Hannah as Pris has a remarkable physical control, from the moment she stands like two minutes quiet as a statue, without even blinking her eyes, to the terrible moment of her death. And even Harrison Ford, having had a long chain of mediocre roles lately, is here in perhaps his best role ever. It's touching to see his face after Roy Batty's saving his life and then, as the dove flies, simply dying. It's as if he understood, and of course he did. The famous question of Rick Deckard being a replicant or not is finally solved in the director's cut: no doubts remain. Ridley Scott had then these shadowy, oppressive environments that made his movies so trademark. This movie transcends the ""science fiction"" genre and moves into deeper territory. No marvel it has become a cult movie. The director's cut is even better than the original (the removal of Harrison Ford's Bogart-like narration helps.) A jewel.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The most powerful SF movie ever,"This is one of my most favorite movies so don't expect me to be objective. The plot is loosely based on a short story by Philip K Dick, often called Dostoyevski of the SF field. It's about an android hunter who is called back from retirement to track down and kill dangerous runaway androids. As he finds and kills them he becomes more and more aware of their struggle to be human, of their yearning for life that can never be fulfilled. They kill their maker when they learn that they can only live a few short years; that they can never be one of us. In the final scene the hunter (Harrison Ford in one of his best roles) finally understands that in their short lives the androids had become more human than humans; that they value life more than us. That's why he was hired to liquidate them. With this film Ridley Scott proved that he is more than just a skilled moviemaker - he is an artist. Sadly, true art is usually noticed and appreciated only many, many years after its creation and it pays little. The movie has an incredible atmosphere. It may not be for everybody. If you are looking for an action flick with lots of explosions then watch ""Commando"" or other trash like that, or, better still, pour gasoline on your car and set it on fire - there will be a nice explosion and great sound effects (and if that's not enough there is the neighbor's car).

A Deep and Atmospheric Sci-fi Masterpiece for All Time,"In the annals of cinema, Blade Runner stands out as something unique. True, many have tried to imitate it, and in the thirty odd years since its release it has influenced countless movies, TV series, anime and video games to one degree or another. Yet while all of these have copied elements of it, none of them have ever captured its exact balance of sci-fi, noir, and philosophy, or replicated its unique atmosphere and otherworldly feel. And none of them had Harrison Ford in the lead and Ridley Scott in the director's chair.For those few not familiar with the story, Ford plays Rick Deckard, a detective tasked with tracking and eliminating replicants, genetic constructs made to perfectly mimic the humans they serve. Since an incident years before, replicants have been banned from earth, upon penalty of death. But now four of them have taken that risk, leaving a wake of death behind them as they search for the key to their very existence. And it's up to Deckard to find them and stop them before they strike again.Their leader, Roy, is easily one of the most menacing villains ever to grace the screen. He is so perfect it's unsettling. Gifted with the looks of a professional model and the body and athleticism of a champion quarterback, his every word and expression exudes keen intelligence- and unmistakable madness. He is the kind of being who knows exactly what he wants and how to get it, and he is not the type to let anything or anyone get in his way. Nor is he the only thing Deckard has to worry aboutWe don't see enough of Leon or Zhora to get much of an impression of them, beyond the fact that they too are desperate and dangerous. Priss however we see very much of; in more ways than one. Beautiful, alluring, and manipulative, she's like a deadly exotic flower, drawing you in to suffocate you in her poison. And then there's Rachel, the replicant who doesn't know she's a replicant. Her demeanor, clothing, and her ever present cigarette remind one of a down and out moll in an old detective movie. Though she barely knows who she really is, she could be a useful ally to Deckard, or possibly something much more.One of the things that sticks with you the most about this movie is the incredible atmosphere that pervades it. Like any good dystopian sci-fi or hard-boiled detective movie, everything here is dark, heavy, and more than a little threatening. The LA of 2019 is crowded, dirty, and run down. Chinese writing and noodle stands are everywhere, as if Chinatown has overrun all LA. Hover cars fly over decaying apartment blocks and flashing theater matinées out of pre Giuliani Manhattan while fantastic monads and pyramids loom over the horizon like a latter day Babylon. Inside the futuristic and the antiquated vie as well in rooms filled with computer screens and electrical tubing alongside candelabras and crumbling plasterwork. And endless rain comes down in sheets over it all, running down every crevice and drenching any who brave the streets.Everywhere neon signs, industrial flares, and searchlights illuminate the cityscape, yet nowhere is it enough to hold back the shadows which bathe the streets. For it's the shadows- both physical and metaphorical- that make the world within the film. The director and cinematographers do as many things with these shadows as the best expressionist filmmaker. They use them to alternately obscure and draw attention to faces and scenery, to heighten the sense of danger and mystery, to create harsh contrasts with the blinding strobes and searchlights. And they remind us that everything that's happening is happening within the shadows of society, the dirty underbelly unseen by the good folks safe in their homes.And just as well that it is. For this is a world filled with violence and corruption not fit for innocent eyes, and the filmmaker's don't let you forget it for a moment, especially not in the action scenes. With slow motion and bluesy synth music, Zhara's death is as stylized and artificial as anything in Blade Runner's world. Yet at the same time it's drawn out, bloody, even traumatic. The editing and camera work aren't trying to make it look cool, they're emphasizing the fact that a desperate frightened woman is dying alone on a rainy sidewalk. To paraphrase the film's most famous line, the report may read ""routine retirement of a replicant"", but it won't make Deckard feel any better about shooting a woman in the back.Yet for all its impact this scene doesn't even begin to compare with the finale. Deckard's final showdown with Roy is mesmerizing in its beauty and brutality; a demented fever dream hunt, like Most Dangerous Game blended with Olympia and German expressionist horror. Even out of his mind and with his body betraying him, Roy is the superior combatant to Deckard in every way. In a strait on fight to the finish it would all be over in an instant. But what we get instead is so much more violent, intriguing, and spellbinding. And in the end it leaves us with so many questions to ponder; about memory, morality, and what it truly means to be human.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Too much for a centennial,"The special effects of the period are discomforting, as is the excess of darkness.Also disturbing is the vision of the future, apparently also of the time, predicting a kind of chaos, composed of elements such as disorderly crowds, lack of cleanliness, light and structures, as if living not as a cummunity, but as a huddle of selfish individuals seeking to survive.I may be ignorant or inattentive, but the replicants did not seem consistent with the context.

They made a short film seem like a very long one,"I don't know what people see in this film.From what I can tell after reading other reviews, 'Blade Runner' has earned its spot as the most overrated film of all time from nostalgic old men watching an old 'classic' and feeling the emotions they felt when watching it for the first time. Sure, it may have been good back in the day. But as far as filmmaking is concerned nowadays, it's nothing special.This film, in my opinion, tries too hard to be unique, and instead, ends up as a weird and not so wonderful mess. The story just doesn't make much sense, and it fails to answer questions that shouldn't even need to be asked. The poor choice of music and unnecessary scenes also make the film feel twice as long as it is.I definitely wouldn't recommend watching, unless you're watching it ""20 years later and it's still better than the rest"" (it definitely isn't).This film could have easily been an hour shorter and it would have been much better.

"A violent, innovative and disturbing film which is a superb cinematic experience","This is one of my favourite films. Although it was made almost thirty years ago it does not show any signs of being dated. For me it is two hours of superb entertainment and like a few other films it was a ground breaking creation when it was released. I am so glad this film was made because fortunately the care and attention it received from the cast and crew was first rate and there are times during the film when I am so captivated that time seemed to stop. Its disturbing, exciting, thought provoking, visually stunning, violent and the acting is extremely good all round. I have watched this film many times and I still cannot see how it can have been improved upon. It would be completely pointless remaking this film because the original is so good.

It was good to see Harrison Ford in quite a different role, a more serious one, in contrast to his roles in Star Wars and Indiana Jones.

Appropriately Questions the Future,"Blade Runner left ""Bigfoot"" imprint on the science fiction genre 1982. Sci-fi flicks have a pattern of letdowns, but Blade Runner is something special, sustaining freshness when viewed in today's times. Ridley Scott's ambitious vision still questions the audience about the future when Blade Runner's version of ""the future"" is less than a decade away from our time. Scott, though not restricted to the sic-fi genre, unlocks the director's comfort zone and possibly his area of interest. He has a certain feel to his films that can be linked together and recognized through the auteur theory. Blade Runner also weighs on genre theory in it's attack of the humanity's future in the science fiction category.The visuals for Blade Runner need not an extra injection of ""film-botox"", the release year doesn't concern itself with the picture's longevity. When making the decisions for Blade Runner, Scott has his mind in the future imagining what the decor would look like, the clothing that we may wear, and the technology that could corrupt us. The obvious, blue-glow to the photography is beautiful and doesn't feel as cheap as other futuristic tales display their films. The selection of shots and cuts are placed perfectly, including the closeups I love from Scott's films. The sound echoes all the gadgets and violence a neo-noir-sci-fi film can release.Films that predict the future sometimes become cheeky and cryptic with what they want to say; thankfully Blade Runner sprints past those urges and gives its audience everything up front, though the quantity of what they have to spread is quite sizable. Will there eventually be a new race of humans? Are we becoming robots? Who is who? What makes us a human? What makes us a person? Can what we do change who we are? What are the limits of love? I'd even go as far to say Blade Runner hints around issues of race, homosexuality, and slavery. Ridley Scott is almost trying to ply open American's simple-minded views in 1982.Blade Runner is as artful as you can be without becoming pretentious. It's a film requiring your attention, thought, and repeated viewings. Don't worry it's still fun to watch; it has cool action scenes and impeccable blocking. The characters are enriched with feelings of the real world, which adds another layer of identification for Blade Runner's audiences to latch onto. From 1982's eye view, it appeared that Ridley Scott wasn't an optimistic onlooker of the years yet to come. Maybe his opinions were influenced by a vision of his later career never topping his work with Blade Runner and 1979's Alien.Rating: 9Grade: A",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
An Excellent Film,"'Blade Runner' is often said to be one of the best sci-fi films ever and I can understand why.The story is excellent; based on Philip K. Dick's ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" it talks about these artificial humans known as 'replicants' who have been deemed illegal on planet Earth punishable by death. Harrison Ford plays a blade runner whose job it is to hunt down and kill a group of rogue replicants. In the director's cut version the story is explained very well but it does drag out the story a bit too much.Acting in this production is mixed. You have some really good performances; like those of Daryl Hannah and Rutger Hauer who play replicants. You also get fairly basic and wooden performances from Sean Young and surprisingly from Harrison Ford who fails to evoke any emotion whatsoever in this. In the last ten minutes of the film where the pace really picks up with the chase scene between Ford and Hauer there is no emphasis in Ford's character which really let scenes down. Hauer gives an excellent performance, particularly with his final short monologue.Of course the special effects and music are now out-dated but they give the film a certain charm that means it still works today. The settings were excellent; Ridley Scott likes to do what he calls 'layering' in sets where he fills them with so much detail that they look real, this works great in this film. The dystopian setting where both night and day seem to look like the same thing and it constantly rains gives the film a great atmosphere and show just how great Scott is at his job.Overall, I would thoroughly recommend 'Blade Runner'; it's an excellent film with a few aspects that let it down. The story is really interesting, the acting is mostly great with some exceptions and the settings are amazing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Great visuals, acting, and some interesting story elements.","This movie could have been an easy ten as it nearly has it all. Except for one thing that would have helped immensely. Is it the visuals you ask? No, the visuals look great even for a movie made back in 1982. It captures a futuristic city so well, a dark and grimy place with technology in areas to give it a certain color scheme. It is almost a live action anime when one looks at other films such as ""Akira"". Is it the acting you ask? No, the acting could not be better, Harrison Ford playing the lead, a man who hunts down rouge androids and Rutger Hauer is always excellent if you ask me. No one does a better job if he had a more typical Hollywood look he would have been the lead in a lot more mainstream fare. And Sean Young and Daryl Hannah look absolutely great, with Daryl looking rather hot. So is it the story? Not entirely. The story has very good elements in it and there is something there. So what is it you ask? Well I know I am going to get hammered for voicing this opinion, but keep in mind it is an opinion...the main thing I had a problem with is the lack of action. I know story and such are important and yes there are lots of movies with no action I like, but this movie was about a man hunting down dangerous androids. This alone should entail that there is going to be a lot more action in the movie than there ended up being. Though the ending was excellent and everything else in this movie was superbly done, I needed some more shoot outs, more blood, and more death. At times the pacing in the movie had me a tad bored, and while it was still nice to look at and it was nice to see the actors have some good dialog, I always kept wanting more adrenaline type action. So there I said it, and I sort of regret it as this is probably one of those movies that people will not take to kindly anything negative said about it. Overall though it was a fine movie and entertaining. I loved Ford as the hunter like I said and I always enjoy Hauer. It amazes me this movie did not do better at the box office than it did. Just the visual style of it had to be something to marvel at back in 1982. So a rather good movie that could have been nearly perfect with a bit more action.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

I love it.,"This movie is made after Philip K. Dick novel, ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"". Seek reference on wikipedia if you want to fill the background info of the movie.I was familiar with Philip K. Dick writings, but I missed this one. First I saw the movie and after I did read the book, and as far I am concerned , the movie is better and doesn't follow close the book.At it's release , was a commercial failure, Harrison Ford hate it and there are several version. I got to watch two of them. First one , on a VHS tape, with Deckard (Harrison Ford) voice over and now a director cut on DVD without the voice. Although other disagree , I liked the voice over version. It gives a good insight, goes well with the scenery and music.Since the movie was made in early 80's , it has a retro style and visual effects might seem outdated by today standards. Remember, personal computers, flat screens, were in incipient state back then. Despite that, Blade Runner has a beautiful, dark, unique image and feeling . The score from Vangelis is one of the best if not the best movie score, at least for me (I love Vangelis's music).It is a sad , cold icy on the spine movie, for retrospective kind of people. You will enjoy the cast (Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Edward James Olmos and his origami, ... ), the plot (despite some logic holes), the way it raise questions and of course, the final; one of the most symbolic and best movie endings.I had the opportunity to first watch it several years after release, when it was just another case on a shelve of a rent store. It was a joy to discover it. I tried to recommend it to other peoples, but it seems , when hyped, doesn't have the same effect.I still watch this movie , from time to time, when I want to get a cold shiver on my back.

Blade Runner: Theatrical Cut,"This gorgeous Ridley Scott original is a science fiction tone poem with an introductory taste of the visual mastery soon to come out of this fine arts trained filmmaker's POV.

Blade Runner: Theatrical Cut; 1982.Xtra: Ridley On History I have liked Ridley Scott since Blade Runner and I remember him saying that he liked to ""reimagine"" history wherever there were gaps in the historic record or in the story myth (as in the case with Robin Hood). He did it admirably in 'Kingdom of Heaven', in '1492: Conquest of Paradise' and most notably in 'Gladiator'.

Disappointing,"I'm a huge fan of Ridley Scott, many of whose titles reside in my top 50 all-time greats, but this film is a mess.

It's nicely shot, with beautiful images of a creative and realistic future world, and as well directed as I would expect. But what exactly is it trying to tell us about humanity? I have no idea.Ford gives a decent performance, but the rest are disappointing. Hauer in particular under-performs, being nowhere near as menacing as he later proved he can be. Nobody else stands out as especially good or bad, an illustration of banality that pervades what could have been a classic movie.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
I just don't get it,"It seems fitting that one of Ridley Scott's most popular movies is about androids, since his body of work is filled with a disproportionate amount of visual flair, and a distinct lack of humanity (see ""Black Hawk Down"" or ""Hannibal"").  ""Blade Runner"" scores a slot on my ""Overrated Movie List,"" a would-be sci-fi epic with a dash of shallow philosophy thrown in that fails to excite or intrigue in any way.  The plot is a lot like ""The Fugitive,"" with super-smart androids in place of humans, and the jaded cop (played by Harrison Ford's hunky monotone) designed to track four of the rogues down. ""Blade Runner"" contains its share of stunning visuals (which hold up surprisingly well, even today), but its characters are unappealing (or, in the case of Rutger Hauer and Daryl Hannah, given little to work with) and the plot, when stripped to its core, is rather thin.5.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

A Look into the Future,"When discussing the works of Ripley Scott, it is extremely difficult at best not to use such cerebrally intimidating terms such as ""eclectic"", ""noir"", and ""dazzling technology"". As such, this review will attempt to keep such terms to a minimum.In 1979 Ridley Scotts second film that he ever made, ""Alien"", was a smash hit. (His first film ever was ""The Duelist"" in 1977, in case you were wondering). The movie ""Alien"" was hailed as a masterpiece in which he mixed visceral horror with science fiction. Its no surprise then, that Scott's third movie, he mixed film noir and science fiction in much the same way to make the technically astonishing movie ""Blade Runner"" based on the 1968 classic by Phillip Dick called ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"". Although it did not do well at the box office, is another stroke of genius. As the movie starts off, there is a virtual tour of futuristic Los Angeles. The movie watcher is made to feel as if they have awoken from a cryogenic chamber and are observing the changes that have taken place.: The weather and environmental color is drab, there are gigantic animated billboards offering goods and services(something that didn't exist in 1982 but already exists now), and that Coke is still around. Even though the scenes were constructed using 1982 technology, they are still breathless and when viewed on a flat screen TV are close to three dimensional. Next is the introduction to the melancholic Deckard (played by Harrison Ford) who in contrast of the Replicants that he chases, appears to take life for granted. The philosophical themes in this picture are endless. One popular philosophy is that Deckard himself is a Replicant this theory is doubtful as Replicants appear to be superior in strength and maybe even intelligence to humans. Deckard is only able to bring Replicants down to retirement by relying on the one edge that humans have over Replicants: experience. Since Replicants can only live for four years, they do not have as much experience at anything as their human counterparts. In addition to the movies in depth philosophy, Blade Runner makes several realistic predictions: (1) Los Angeles/California is predicted as being culturally isolated and diverse to the point of mayhem. This forecast is even more probable today, than it was in 1982. California and especially Los Angeles has already become extremely diverse culturally. Caucasians no longer represent the majority of the population. Additionally, each ethnic group tends to isolate from the other ethnic groups. There is Chinatown, Korea Town, Olvera Street, and Watts. Each neighborhood has its own cultures and languages that are not only spoken, but seen on Billboards and even street signs. Select cultures are even pandered to by the government. Even though it is currently the law to be a US Citizen to vote and to have a driver's license, and even though it is a requirement to read English to become a US citizen, Drivers License exams and ballots are written in Spanish and many of the Asian languages. There is no need or incentive for an immigrant to assimilate into one uniform society. (2) Technology continues to advance at a prolific rate. From 1982 to 2010, technology has grown tremendously. No one in 1982 would have dreamed of DVDs, flat screen TVs, GPS systems, iPods, or cell phones that do just about everything would be in wide use in 2010. Flying cars may not be far off. It would appear that the only thing that might prevent Replicants from ever being built would be a possible ethical/political dilemma much like the one that surrounds cloning. (3) The weather and environment appears to be drearier. As global warming theories and oil and other toxic spills become more prevalent, this event is quite possible. (4) Big Corporations still exist and exert their influence. From the Coke billboards to the billboards offering a better life on a space colony, consumers are still being told that their life is inadequate but could be made better if they purchased certain products or moved to a ""better"" location. Watching the movie leaves one with the feeling of awe. The realism of situations and special effects only serve to enhance this effect. This movie is a much watch for any fan of science fiction, or to anyone who wants to get a look into the future.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Extraordinary Achievement,"I first saw this film a few years ago and really liked it. I saw it again in the cinema a few weeks ago and was really blown away this time. I have certainly matured and so have a new outlook on the film. Perhaps the remastering of the film adds also to the experience. I went out and bought the DVD which also contains the Dangerous Days documentary.This is a true cinematic experience - sound, visual, story. Rarely has a world been so vivedly portrayed. The detail and visual beauty is simply astounding. Dangerous Days tells of the work that went into it and I appreciate the film even more as a result. The era before special effects - the ""magic lantern"" (David Lynch) quality that comes from non-computerised effects.Fascinating story - one of the critics on the Dangeous Days documentary speaks of the message - don't be a slave/replicant who simply follows orders. I get a very different message from the film - wherever there is life (any sort of life) there are feelings. We cannot create something in order to use and manipulate it - everything has feelings and must be respected. Roy Batty has been created to be used selfishly by humans - a fighting machine. at the end we see that everything living has feelings. He feels and clings on to life like we all do! Human selfishness is the theme I get from the film. Humans abusing life! The love scene between Deckard and Rachael seems very contrived to me. His aggressiveness is unappealing and makes no sense to me in the story. The documentary sheds some light on this.Dangerous Days is very interesting An extraordinary film and achievement. Some of the emotion could be a bit deeper but instead of looking at what the film has not let me remember the outstanding achievement that the film is.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Near flawless sci-fi/noir.,"""It's too bad she won't live. But then again, who does?""(This review is for the Final Cut version of Blade Runner.) It took me two viewings to really appreciate Blade Runner, but once it hit me, it me hit me like a ton of bricks.Out of all the movies that Ridley Scott has done, this is the one that proves without a doubt that he deserves his place as one of the great directors. This is one of the most fully-realized and technically and artistically impressive worlds that I've ever seen created on film. The backgrounds and sets are wonderful. The cinematography is outstanding. Nearly every single shot is visually striking in some manner. Blade Runner's setting is a wildly imaginative glimpse of the future, yet grounded in a gritty reality that's appealing and fits the tone of the movie perfectly. As does the music.As for the story, it's intelligent, engrossing, and perfectly paced. One that you don't have to be a huge fan of sci-fi or noir to enjoy. In broad terms, it's about an ex-police officer who specializes in eliminating artificial humans (replicants), and his efforts to track down four who have illegally come to earth. There's more to it than that, of course, but watching the story unfold and letting it draw you into this alternate future is a pleasure that I wouldn't want to rob from anyone reading this. Just trust me, there are deep themes that are explored here, but the movie is thoroughly entertaining even if you aim to enjoy it on only its most superficial levels.As you may have guessed, this is my favorite Scott film, as well as my favorite Harrison Ford role. It stands out for its memorable and three dimensional characters like the elegant and haunting replicant Rachael and the kind (but creepy) Sebastian. The use of light and shadows throughout the movie gives it a timeless, classic quality. Sci-fi (heck, movies in general) doesn't get much better than this one. Beyond it's own undeniable quality, the genre as a whole has benefited from Blade Runner's influence.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Philosophy on Film,"In Los Angeles in November 2019, ex-police officer Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is detained by officer Gaff (Edward James Olmos) and brought to his former supervisor, Bryant (M.

Deckard, whose job as a ""Blade Runner"" was to track down bioengineered beings known as replicants and ""retire"" (a euphemism for killing) them, is informed that four have come to Earth illegally.Science fiction and philosophy go hand in hand. From the earliest days up through ""The Matrix"" and beyond, it allows the human mind to explore hypothetical situations. This movie is a good action film (though slower than necessary in parts), but carries with it an ethical question: when do robots become human? Do they ever? And should we be constructing them in the first place? (The film sort of skirts this issue, saying they were used for slave labor -- but why bother to give them feelings, senses, sexual organs and so on?) I do not know which of the seven (!) versions is best. I most recently (2016) saw the theatrical, but feel it was lacking something.

Since I've never seen this from top to bottom in one sitting forgive me for errors in the plot, but it goes something like this: Ford is savvy, gritty future cop with an ability to take a punch and trained to spot replicants (robots who appear to be human), called back to duty when a few replicants turn bad. The replicants are on what turns out to be a deadly mission of their own. Along the way Ford hooks up with Young, together they make the movie.

The cyberpunk design is timeless, sometimes I wish less cg nowadays and more creative solutions as in this brilliant movie.3.

Tears in the Rain,"This movie is as dark and foreboding as Ridley's earlier ""Alien"" - Naturally, because Syd Mead also did a lot of the production design. And he used everything he could get his hands on to build an eerie cityscape - Including, ironically, the Millennium Falcon spaceship from Star Wars, which was star Harrison Ford's ride in the SW Original Trilogy.I've heard many Philip K Dick purists pound this film, because it changes some things from the Book ""Do Androids Dream of Dlectric Sheep"" on which this film is based. - But what those people probably don't know, is that Philip K Dick himself approved of the film-Especially the dark look which he claimed was exactly what he was going for. Philip himself understood that written works rarely can be filmed as written, from Gone with the Wind to Lord of the Rings, filmmakers are constrained for time. To tell a 500 page book in 2 hours running time is difficult.So even as Ridley Scott changed some of the science and mechanics regarding ""replicants"" and altered a bit of the character interaction, he did maintain the spirit of the novel - Which is, Do things we create, which appear Human, actually become valid living beings - Do they have souls, and more important, do they have a Spirit? This is explored in this film.""I Think, therefore I am."" Eventually, mankind will build a computer capable of passing the Turing Test, and when that happens, will we treat that invention as a slave? Do I treat my Home Computer as a kind of Slave? Actually they way I see it, my home computer always takes on characteristics of myself. So in a way, my home Desktop and my Laptops, are living breathing beings.I loved the Narrated version - Mostly cos thats the way I saw it originally, and the removal of the narration track, kind of ruins it for me, it's not the same without it.Maybe if I had seen it without the narration, but all my information about the movie and what is going on, is IN that deleted narrative.As much as I like the extended cuts and the ""Final Cut"" - I feel sort of betrayed that there was no ""Final Cut"" with the option to have the narration running if I wanted to.There are also several scenes that are different, in the US Theatrical version versus the International version. For instance, when Rutger Hauer kills his ""God"" Dr Tyrell, in the version I originally saw, it's a more gruesome. Later, Hauer shoves a long nail through his hand, thats also missing in the extended/final cut.Other than that, the two versions are pretty close.And I do like both versions, or, all versions. I have seen about 6 different cuts of this, each with slight differences.Mainly, when I first saw this, it was with the Narration, which gives good exposition on what is happening. Without it, there are a number of things left unexplained. The Narration track explains pretty much what is going on, also the nature of Ford's character and the characters of Bryant and Gaff. Also some of the motivations of the Replicants.When Ford is hanging from the top of the Bradbury Building by two broken fingers, in the rain, I was sweating bullets.

A classic no Doubt,I was being reading that this was just masterpiece and is one of the best sci-fi movie. I must when I first saw the movie I turned the movie off 30 minuets into it and I knew that this is a movie you had to see in the theater. Later that day I was told that the movie was playing at the Lagoon Therater and rushed to closet showing and loved it. Harrison gives an Oscar hype performance and his best ever. Brion James plays a great bad guy and certainly deserves more attention. The story is absolutely brilliant and one of the best I have ever heard and directing by Ridley Scott is just great. The thing about the movie that was very was that there was some romance in this movie that really didn't fit that much and kinda got me out of the mood I was in for the entire movie. All and all this is a classic no doubt and should see this movie at any time you get the chance.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Many qualities - above all it makes you think,"English is not my first language, so bear with me.I guess the overall quality of ""Blade Runner"" is intelligence. It is a movie that makes you think and it is made by thinking individuals. It tells you not to trust the surface, and this is always a bold thing to do for a movie - given that it is, by definition, composed of surface only.The cast is perfect, Rudger Hauer as the leader of a group of ""replicants"" (androids) and Harrison Ford as ""blade runner"" Rick Deckard, charged to hunt them down, above all others.Daryl Hannah really is her part - a desperate replicant, while Sean Young as Rachael, the female attraction for Harrison Ford played her extremely interesting role well enough, but is still the weakest link in the chain in my opinion. Ford has subsequently played many inferior roles in movies. In this one he is the right character and he's - ever trying to be sure of himself, while being corroded by doubts - brilliant.What's also special about the movie is the atmosphere. Ridley Scott didn't get to use computer generated special effects back in 1982. Flying cars were not easily put on celluloid. Don't expect an orgy of special effects, that's not the focus of this movie. There is a lot of action going on but it focuses on people, not explosions. In spite of some minor logical glitches Scott manages to compose a credible scenario, a sinister vision of a might-be-future with a few subtle flashes of dark humor. On a side note: you might want to stock up on umbrellas before 2019, according to Ridley Scott we are in for rain.Of course the movie would not rank among the best movies without the soundtrack by Vangelis, which is a masterpiece by itself. Together photography and music form something exceptional.Unlike with many inferior sci-fi movies, there is more to ""Blade Runner"" than just atmosphere, special effects and a great sound track. The movie makes you think about some of the big philosophical questions concerning the individual as well as society. What is life? What's special about humans? Why is one life worth more than another? How shall we deal with death? And what's the role of society in all of this?The movie - especially the director's cut - does not try to answer or appease in the end. All it tells us is that we can't get away from these questions, no matter where we go, be it to an ""off-world colony"" or just ""north"".""Blade Runner"" is the best film of its kind and one of the best I know overall. This one should not be ""lost in time like tears in the rain"" so quickly.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Along with 2001, the most unique science fiction film of all time. Coupled with film noir and dystopian elements, this is a film that stimulates the imagination.","One of my favorite films of all time. Before I get into the details of this classic, I cannot stress how much the final cut is the definitive version of this film. If you plan on purchasing this film, that is the best version to buy, hands down. I also cannot stress how much the visuals in Blade Runner make today's high budget CGI movies look like a joke, which they are in my opinion. This is a film noir story spliced with science fiction and the result is something that is unique and still is. A lot of films try so hard to be gritty and dark, and Blade Runner, in my opinion, achieves that in the highest caliber. With it's dystopian setting and bleak story, the movie is very dreamlike.And what this movie achieves in doing is telling a very simple story, but with so much to say. Not a lot happens in the movie, but every scene is vital in progressing the story, without any unnecessary moments of filler. What I love about the film is that it has an ebb and flow to it which feels very intrinsic. When many films do so much and try so hard only to end up failing, Blade Runner easily succeeds by being very subtle.What is very captivating to me is that Ridley Scott created a world that is one of a great imagination. Through the visuals, it has the looks of a world that is very different from our own, but one that is living and breathing, a world that feels run down and claustrophobic to give a feeling of urban alienation, one that exists within our society. The immersiveness of this film is very strong and it takes a great storyteller to pull off a feat as great as that.While Blade Runner is a science fiction film, it hits the heart with its sense of humanity and to me, I think that is what it achieves in being such a sentimental film to me. Whenever I want to watch a film to escape, I will put on Blade Runner.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Ford Gets Around,"For years and years I considered this picture as some of the most top-shelf science fiction that was available.

one of the greatest movies of all time,"I find it quite astonishing that some people view this film as dull. All the way through the film Ridley Scott keeps an atmosphere going which both enchants and excites the viewer. Not to mention the rarity of a film having a moral to the story, so to speak. Visually, this movie is as good as they get and at times the film can seem poetic. The soundtrack to this film is brilliant and adds a very ambient tone to the film, as provided by Vangelis. I think those who find it dull need to watch this film again to understand the true brilliance of the films content. Many people say that 2001:a space odyssey is a dull film, but who can disagree that it was a major turning point in film history. The same is true, i think of Blade Runner.

Artsy fartsy movie - plots deeper on star trek,"I fail to see why people like this movie other than reasons based on ""Wow, wasn't the cinematography awesome."" Sure the cinematography was good I guess, but if the plot doesn't keep up than it's a waste in my opinion. The movie brings up the classic concept of ""what does it mean to be human,"" but then never really creates any interesting twists or plot development based on this. I doubt even back in '82 the concept of dealing with artificial life was 'that' novel. I've seen old Star Treks that dealt with the issue. Strip out all the dark lighting, rain, and slum shots and what do you have? - a boring movie. It got so old afer a while seeing the flying police cars over rainy slums. Then inside buildings rays of light kept flashing in as if from search lights. Everything seemed so artificial and it was as if the director was just wasting my time.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
One of the greatest movies ever!!,"The ultimate sci-fi film and pretty much one of the greatest, most visually arresting movies ever made. Blade Runner is a true cinema classic, not a box office success and not taken too well on its original release but it has since become a cult classic, critically acclaimed and in 90 percent of movies buffs top five movies. The film has spawned countless imitations of its dank futuristic world but the imagary has never been bettered, it has also created a debate that has run since it first hit the screens in 82, that debate being `is Deckard a replicant?', this has never been answered and I doubt ever will, Harrison Ford says one thing and Ridley says another. The film itself is pure brilliance, the visuals are striking, this film is certainly before its time and the special effects even now look top draw. The imagery created is exceptional with the futuristic world leaving you tongue protrudingly engrossed. As well as the visuals the plot is quite good too. Deckard, played by Harrison Ford, is a Blade Runner, a sort of cop/bounty hunter who hunts down beings known as replicants and kills them. The replicants were created to serve us but a small group in an outworld colony go bezerk and start killing humans, this means that all Replicants must be destroyed. The story has elements that obviously inspired the Terminator films and while some people call Arnie the ultimate cyborg I have to say for me Rutger Hauer is the ultimate bad guy in the artificial human category. This film launched him to cult status, he steals the show here as he has in other stand out bad guy performances in Nighthawks and the Hitcher. Hauer exudes an evil charisma in this film as the leader of a small group of murderous replicants, Roy Batty. Hauer really is chilling at times and he has an intimidating presence on screen, his lines are classic including the legendary tears in the rain speech at the end, which Hauer himself wrote. The other actors are very good, Harrison Ford is at the top of his form as Deckard and the two gorgeous ladies Daryll Hannah and Sean Young are also good. This is a must see movie, I eagerly await the re-release on DVD as my current copy is dissapointingly bereft of features. Overall I must give this 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
My favorite movie,"See ""The Final Cut"" if possible. In my opinion,and that of many critics, the best sci-fi movie ever made. It makes you think about what makes us human. Rutger Hauer's moving speech at the end ( see Youtube ""Tears in Rain') brought some of the crew to tears.

The ending of this one will keep you guessing and this movie is definitely ahead of its time for sure. While I like other Harrison Ford movies better, this is a great role for him.

What Ridley Scott has done to this film is inhuman.,"I recently saw the directors cut of this film. After about 75 minutes I couldn't bare to watch this atrocity any longer. It sounded as though it would be an amazing film. LA in the future. Robots running wild. Gaudy neon lit streets in a hellish future. I was convinced that this would be brilliant, but alas, how wrong I was.There are periods of up to ten minutes when there is complete silence. This is supposed to be tension but it is excruciatingly boring. The acting is even worse, in particular Daryl Hannah's performance. And the script is absolutely atrocious. This film would have been SO much better if it was directed by someone else, maybe James Cameron or Robert Zemeckis.

Incredible Movie,"Ridley Scott pioneered a new genre with this movie, ""Future Noir"". His attention to detail is incredible. What Scott was able to do in this movie was phenomenal considering when it was made. The movie is much more than great futuristic sets and special effects. It's a great story about the stupidity of mankind. Unlike a typical, adventure/action/science fiction movie, the line between hero and villain is crossed by both sides. Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer and Sean Young turned in great performances. It's a movie that leaves you thinking about many social issues, past and present. Harrison Ford is a ""Blade Runner"". A ""Blade Runner"" as the opening text which scrolls across your screen explains, is a specific type of law enforcement officer who is tasked with hunting down rogue androids. The music by Vangelis is also outstanding and helps create a feel and atmosphere that makes the world created by Scott seem all the more real.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Non Dir. Cut,"OMG This is one of the best 10 movies ever made. I don't care who says it, what genre you're into, or what, this movie will make your list, one caveat, not the Director's cut. Mr Scott was a genius and I love him but what he took out of this movie desecrates it. The movie with the narrative and extra scenes adds content and complexity from the book from the incredible mind of Philip Dick. Without the narrative and the bizarre scenes added by Mr. Scott adds confusion and really makes the film more of a ""Disney"" type, entertaining, production rather than a medium to provoke thought and enlightenment as the Non Director's cut. I hope those of you fortunate enough to see both agree, and if you have not seen both Please seek out the other. This is a pivotal movie in our society and the subtleties do carry a lot.

"To put it simply: Brilliant, absolutely brilliant!","Blade Runner is without a doubt one of my favorite science fiction films. It is thematically deep and stunning to look at and the acting is overall very fine. My problem when writing this review is that I don't know where to begin because the film has so many elements which are all essential in understanding the film and the many symbols used in it. My review is mainly directed towards the director's cut version which in my opinion is the superior one.Harrison Ford plays the main character or the protagonist and he does an excellent job. His character is darker than in both Star Wars and Indiana Jones and it works just as well. Ford delivers every line with confidence and sense of timing and basically produces a well rounded character. The acting isn't all there is to the character, however. If you look at the wardrobe of the character you will find that the long brown coat he wears resembles that of a detective from films in the 30s and 40s. A small thing but it helps define the character and brings some post modernism into the film. The same kind of characterization through wardrobe is used in many places in the film. Rachel (Sean Young) resembles a so-called 'femme fatale' from 30s detective/crime films with her neat hair and dark dresses. Sean Young's acting is impeccable and she delivers a stylized yet effective performance. Rutger Hauer has his (without a doubt) finest performance of his career as the antagonist. He steals every scene and even Harrison Ford has since admitted that he had trouble matching the intensity of Hauer. The supporting cast is good as well so acting wise the film is pretty flawless.The film is visually stunning as well. Every scene is cramped with atmosphere and tension and even today more than 20 years later the film is still a visual feast. There are some who would say that Blade Runner is an example of style over substance and I am almost inclined to agree because the film really is stunning to look at. Ridley Scott's vision of the future is dystopian at best and as the camera pans over the futuristic landscape of Los Angeles you cannot help but feel a sense of dread at how depressing and ugly the world looks and strangely this is a good thing. The fact that the film makes you feel something is a clear cut sign of how brilliant it really is. Scott's ability to make people feel with nothing but images is quite simply awe inspiring. If the thematic enigmas do not spellbind you then at least marvel at the visual accomplishments. Along with the visual style the sound track of the film is also highly innovative and different. The sound definitely helps in creating the mood of the film.As previously stated the film is highly philosophical but every person should watch the film and come to their own conclusion about the film. It would be wrong of me to impose my analysis and conclusions upon future viewers because you should definitely see this film with an open mind and you should definitely see it at least twice so as to get all the nuances of the film. Suffice to say there is enough thematic material (including quite a few bible references) to keep a philosophical conversation going for quite some time. If you don't believe me check the film out and find out for yourself.Blade Runner stands for me as Ridley Scott's finest hour. The film has everything needed to become a classic and it delivers in both style and substance. A deep involving story, a great cast, fabulous visual elements and above all the film makes you think and it raises some interesting (and relevant) issues. Blade Runner is one my all time favorite films and I recommend it to all people with a philosophical vein, those who are not afraid to think and of course fans of science fiction movies.10/10 - on my top 5 of best films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

A Sci-Fi Grand Slam,"This contains some plot info that may or may not spoil the movie for you, but learning the plot has never spoiled a movie for me and I hope you get a good feel for this movie by reading this if you've never seen Blade Runner before.I saw this movie when I was only 12 years old. At the time the action and beautiful post-apocalyptic imagery is what drew my attention. The characters seemed very real to me, having odd ""ticks"" and very real reactions to the situations into which they are locked. Since that time, I joined the military and experienced life and my taste in movies changed.I came across Blade Runner in a store and bought it up to watch this childhood favorite of mine in a new light. As I expected, the storyline became the focal point for me. Deckard (Harrison Ford) became the battle-weary, hardened veteran faced with difficult choices that I have seen first hand in military service. I could completely relate. Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) wasn't the stereotypical replicant (cloned humans used for war) bad guy anymore, either. Now, to me, has become the victim of his own creation fighting against the system to live a life that he deems normal. The problem is that the system won't allow that since, being bred for war, replicants live to fight and kill. Being bred for the sole purpose of fighting wars, the replicants were given short lifespans of about 5 years, which Roy and his replicant gang are trying to overcome through unscrupulous means. Mainly through violence and murder.Meanwhile, Deckard is trying to track Roy down. You get to see clips of replicants receiving psychological evaluations. The purpose for those scenes, I assume, is to see how replicants are fundamentally different than a human being.The movie has a few surprises and Rutger Hauer's character, Roy, has a great feel and some very quotable lines. I felt tears welt up in my eyes when he gave his parting speech.One of the most excellent film noir/sci-fi movies ever made and a cast worthy of any great movie.

Sci-fi tour de force,"""Blade Runner"" is a cinematic masterpiece that continues to captivate audiences even decades after its initial release. Ridley Scott's 1982 science fiction film is a visual and philosophical tour de force that explores the complex relationship between humans and replicants, bioengineered beings created for various purposes.At its core, ""Blade Runner"" is a neo-noir thriller set in a dystopian future, and its dark, rain-soaked streets and futuristic cityscape are as iconic as the film itself. The film's visual effects were groundbreaking at the time and still hold up remarkably well today, creating a rich and immersive world that feels both gritty and fantastical.Harrison Ford delivers a memorable performance as Rick Deckard, a ""blade runner"" tasked with hunting down and ""retiring"" rogue replicants. His portrayal adds depth to the character, who grapples with moral and existential questions as he confronts the humanity of the beings he's tasked with eliminating.The film's score, composed by Vangelis, is an integral part of the experience, enhancing the atmosphere and emotional impact of the story. The haunting, synthesizer-driven music perfectly complements the film's noir elements.One of the film's most enduring strengths is its exploration of the nature of humanity. Through the replicants, ""Blade Runner"" raises profound questions about identity, empathy, and the consequences of playing god. Rutger Hauer's portrayal of Roy Batty, the leader of the rogue replicants, is both chilling and deeply moving, leaving a lasting impression as he grapples with the ephemeral nature of existence.""Blade Runner"" is a thought-provoking and visually stunning film that has had a profound influence on the science fiction genre. It's a classic that continues to resonate with viewers, offering a glimpse into a future that is as relevant today as it was when the film was first released. If you're a fan of science fiction or thought-provoking cinema, ""Blade Runner"" is a must-watch, and its impact on the genre is undeniable.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

I know there are all those insinuations that Deckard might well be a replicant, but to me, I couldn't really care less.

Style over substance - 1:0,"When you watch movies like 'Blade Runner' or 'Alien' you realize how much Ridley Scott was a typical director of the 80's and you wonder how he now became a typical director of the 90's. With these two films I mentioned he directed the two most important science-fiction movies since 'Star Wars' and defined a style which became regular in films like 'Dark City', the other 'Alien'-films, 'Outland' or 'Terminator'. This dark, quiet tone with not too much action, not too much story but a lot of style and atmosphere. Today it seems impossible to make a film like 'Blade Runner'.Maybe one of the most important differences is the look of the special effects. I like big CG-effects which make you go 'Ah' and 'Oh', but the effects in sci-fi films of the 80's are different and somehow better than today. Most of them are models and matte paintings and this looks somehow more realistic. You see that the big complex the industrial named Tyrell lives in is real. It is standing there. This always amazed me.But 'Blade Runner' has more than special effects, although they were and are really impressing. I was pretty sure there was more and during watching the film the second time after several years (this time in the Director's Cut) I wondered what. I mean, the story isn't really so complicated and hard to understand. Cop has to find four replicants. Replicants don't want to die. I mean, that's it. The characters all seem to be unhappy and with a lot of secrets but that's nothing new. This hasn't changed pretty much. And you don't get to know so much more about them.I think the films lives nearly entirely out of his atmosphere. Everything looks so dark and so much full of atmosphere you nearly can feel it. It's always raining (and it does in most dark science-fiction-films, because there are less things that produce more atmosphere) and always dark (the same). The characters are looking more at each other than they talk. They look at each other and into mirrors and in to the dark sky. This is what makes them alive, since you don't know anything about them.Consider Harrison Ford's character. At the beginning he sits in a Chinese fast-food bar. He says he quit his job as a blade runner and he doesn't want to do it anymore. Why? Why can his former chief (M. Emmet Walsh) so simply put him back into his old job? You see some photos in Ford's apartment but never get to know who the people on it are. But still I think it's his best role ever. It's his only role where he plays a character who isn't simply good. He does a bad job and he knows it.Still, this a really fascinating movie with lots of neat details like the big elevator at Tyrell's or the puppets at Sebastian's who always run into the same door. And the showdown between Ford and Hauer (who had definitely his best role here) is just fantastic. But does anything of this make real sense? I'm not quite sure. And I'm less sure if I think about the work of the author Philip K. Dick on whose novel the film is based. Dick is a fantastic sci-fi writer and he has always a lot to say. He makes us think. 'Blade Runner' made me think too. But I just didn't get anywhere. Maybe I'm just stupid.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Masterpiece of the Democratic Multicultural Nightmare Dystopia,"This movie can be reviewed as many things, but where it really shines is the multicultural nightmare dystopia that it is showing/warning the audience (about).This movie served as a warning if anyone would listen, unfortunately liberal western nations seemed to have not been paying attention. But soon enough they will and this movie will seem as a symbolic warning in history.In terms of pure scifi entertainment it is very dark and dystopian and very entertaining.I would couple this with movies such as 1984 and Brazil and other movie that were attempting to warn an audience through fictional entertainment. (The Zero Theorem to some degree).Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? You'll need to ask AI someday.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
